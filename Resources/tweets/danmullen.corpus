<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Also, being able to long-press the icon in the top right is far from intuitive. The reason given for removing the swipe up for transactions on Android was that it wasn't obvious. (Not sure why when it's deemed fine on iOS.)

<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Huge fan of Starling but I really dislike the white nav bar. Looks very dated, the way Android apps used to look in the early days.

<|startoftext|>@ProtonMail @ProtonVPN Only discounting the 1-year deal means I have no reason to sign up for the 2-year deal. Doesn't make sense!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProtonMail @ProtonVPN I was hoping for a decent 2-year deal on mail but there doesn't appear to be any discount over and above the normal multi-year discount.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProtonMail @ProtonVPN I've been a free user for several months and have been waiting to see what Black Friday deals you have on this year.

<|startoftext|>@pembsLFC @Sean_Leaf @paulsinha Yes, if he was referring to black players, absolutely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BulletRobinson @paulsinha I tend to agree. I'm just pointing out the difference between ignorance, bigotry, racism, etc. All can cause offence but I get more riled by those that intend to upset others.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pembsLFC @Sean_Leaf @paulsinha But he's specifically talking about the subset of managers that are black. If he just said "managers" it wouldn't make sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pembsLFC @Sean_Leaf @paulsinha Why isn't that acceptable?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sean_Leaf @paulsinha Reading the full article, there are a lot of ignorant comments. Not malicious but definitely ignorant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sean_Leaf @paulsinha My point is more that "person of colour" is an accepted term, which seems odd given "coloured" is not. There are much worse examples, e.g. Ron Atkinson. Where people use outdated rather than downright offensive language, perhaps education is better than sacking/public shaming?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulsinha I remember when the PC term was "coloured", now it is considered offensive. Yet "people/person of colour" is a term widely used today. In Greg Clarke's case, even if the term he used is considered outdated you need to look at the context. I don't think his intentions were bad.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DurhamPolice @DurhamRPU If you're looking for Dominic Cummings, you're too late. He's back in London.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Although I voted them in at the last election, they have lost my vote. I suspect they have also lost the votes and trust of millions of other people that have been appalled at this flagrant hypocrisy, arrogance and injustice. @BorisJohnson #StayAtHome #ProtectTheNHS #SaveLives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The way the government has defended his actions has sickened me. I have lost all respect for the PM and certain members of his cabinet. When I hear their attempts to justify what he did, I become increasingly angry. By failing to condemn his actions, they've put lives at risk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If he had admitted an error of judgment, shown a little humility, apologised... maybe people would have had some sympathy for him. The truth is he thinks he is better than everyone else, all the ordinary people that have sacrificed so much over these last couple of months.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you were going to act like an idiot and test your eyesight by making a 60-mile round trip in your car, surely you would leave your child at home? And your wife for that matter, who coincidentally celebrated her 45th birthday that very day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The story spun in Downing Street's rose garden yesterday was carefully concocted, yet it was full of holes. The crowning turd in the water pipe was Cummings' claim that trouble with his vision led him to load his family into the car for a 60-mile test drive to Barnard Castle!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How anyone can justify driving 260 miles to a family member's home, whilst symptomatic, is beyond me. To claim no wrongdoing is supreme arrogance. Thousands of people have struggled with childcare yet they continued to follow the government's advice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My own mother - who has been shielding due to being extremely vulnerable - has just come out of hospital after having emergency, life-saving surgery yet I have not been able to visit her either in the hospital or at home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ordinary people understood the rules and the vast majority followed them. Old people have suffered from loneliness during isolation, people have died alone in hospital, families have been unable to say goodbye to their loved ones at funerals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least there's one government minister that has acted with integrity over the last few days. As someone that voted Conservative at the last election, I can't quite articulate how furious I am at this whole Dominic Cummings fiasco. The rules were clear and he broke them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jay_mullen @BorisJohnson I'm feeling more angry every day about this. I voted them in at the last election and have stuck by the rules 100% since lockdown began. They have lost my vote and, I suspect, that of many other people who voted for them last time round.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samwhoo @RobertCollings_ @JoeCMerriman Lovely to hear how supportive they were Sam. Hope everything is OK now üëçüèª<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pam Doove! Brilliant üòÇ @ReeceShearsmith<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@richardosman Tough one this week, 78% overall - started strongly with 88% from the first four questions, let myself down with just 61% from the last four.

<|startoftext|>@richardosman Another great quiz Richard.  I scored 46 this week, which is my best score so far!  Looking forward to next week's 'E' quiz Smiling face with open mouth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scottspde @Authy "correcthorsebatterystaple" had to be blacklisted as people took the cartoon too literally and used it as their password!

<|startoftext|>@jay_mullen @ThreeUKSupport Having a look at my options now. Just really surprised that they were happy for me to cancel three SIM contracts, no attempt to keep me as a customer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jay_mullen @ThreeUKSupport I've had similar issues for months. Sick of phoning and not getting any support. It's clearly not good enough to rely on for home broadband. I'm out of contract and got my PAC today. They weren't interested in keeping my custom for my two phones either so also got PACs for those.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport very disappointed. Long-time customer, 3 x SIM cards all out of contract. Called to discuss options only to find I'm better off cancelling all three and going elsewhere or signing up as a new customer, which would get me ¬£187 cashback. Now got 3 PAC codes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gossipmongers1 That would be great!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@susan_turne @Timewalkproject @ij851227 @sharpeleven But exactly the same thing could have been said about the North East, for example Blyth. Always been Labour, Conservative won the seat at the last election. I get the point about feeling like your vote is wasted but it's only like that because everyone thinks the same way.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is incredible from the government. I hope that whatever people's politics, they can appreciate what @RishiSunak is announcing right now. Don't make staff redundant and the government will pay 80% of the wage bill, up to ¬£2,500/month for 3 months (to start with)!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@richardhorton1 Of course the science has changed. Science changes all the time. It adapts as new information comes to light and our understanding increases.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Instead of relying on the tabloids, journalists or TV presenters, have a read of this if you want some facts on coronavirus, COVID-19 and the government's response. Everyone needs to be pulling in the same direction if we are to have any chance of slowing this thing down.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@objectivegreen @garethimurphy @RoryStewartUK It's not as straightforward as you think. A lot of kids will end up congregating in public spaces or having to be looked after by their (potentially vulnerable) grandparents. Also, NHS staff may have to take time off work to look after their kids. No easy solution.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BillNeelyNBC The numbers they put into their model have been revised as we've seen how the rate of infection has risen in the UK and elsewhere. The original plan was to try to flatten the curve and prevent a second peak coming further down the line. Unfortunately as more data has become...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@garethimurphy @RoryStewartUK I thought they were doing that. Trying to get more beds from the private healthcare sector, hotels, etc. and more ventilators built by various manufacturers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillNeelyNBC They are making decisions based on the best science available at the time. The very nature of the scientific process means that as new information becomes available, a different approach may need to be taken. Let's not knock them for that. The aim is to limit the number of deaths<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Swannyg66 It's complex. Partly because it's likely grandparents (i.e. vulnerable people) would end up looking after children and partly because NHS staff may need to be off work in order to look after their kids, leaving the NHS understaffed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoshuaPotash This is a bit disingenuous. Of course taking the hit would be one way of dealing with it.

<|startoftext|>@csshsh @Authy Did you sync them earlier? You must have entered your backup password on the second device, otherwise there would be no way to decrypt the tokens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@csshsh @Authy Once you've added your additional devices to your account, you can turn the multi-device option off. This will prevent any further devices being added but you can still sync between your existing devices.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@csshsh @Authy The multi-device option just allows you to authorise additional devices to use the same Authy account. The backup option actually syncs your tokens to Authy's servers and any additional devices you have authorised.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Authy @csshsh I'm not sure what you're looking for. If you decide to enable multi-device support, you enter a backup password. This is used to generate a key using PBKDF2, which is then used to encrypt your account tokens before they are sent to Authy's servers.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MRDANOKE @StarlingBank I reported this back when the forum was alive! The Pulse currently displays individual transactions when it would make much more sense to display them grouped by merchant.

<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @DanWragg @HelenBierton I suppose the intention with the EUR account then is to receive payments in EUR, thus no fees. It'd also make sense to spend from this account in EUR, again no fees. In that case, I would hope that it becomes possible to use the Starling debit card before the fees are introduced.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanWragg @StarlingBank @HelenBierton Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @DanWragg @HelenBierton With the introduction of a fee to transfer between GBP and EUR accounts, I'm genuinely failing to see the use case for the new offering. With fee-free spending and cash withdrawals already available, the only use I can think of is to be able to lock in a decent rate, a la Revolut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @DanWragg @HelenBierton Sadly this fee negates the whole point of having the account! May as well continue to spend using the GBP account at the Mastercard rate with no markup.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DanWragg @StarlingBank @HelenBierton Disappointing if correct.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@petercorser @RobertBathurst @prodnose @bbc5live Yes, chimps/monkeys may have been used by racists for a long time but that doesn't automatically make any imagery featuring a chimp or a monkey racist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@petercorser @RobertBathurst @prodnose @bbc5live I don't even consider it to be a mistake. When I see a picture of a chimp I don't think of black people. I think of chimps.

<|startoftext|>@whatevillurks @StarlingBank Ok, I think you know what I meant but perhaps I should have worded it as, "... when it reaches four figures I'll use it to pay for a holiday, the upshot being my monthly budgeting is unaffected and the holiday is paid for in full from my stealth savings." üôÑ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KrissyAll @StarlingBank Hahahaha lmao üòÇ You're just envious because you don't have a nice vertical debit card and a pair of Starling socks üòé #bestbank<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank I have other specific Goals for Christmas and a holiday but my intention is to just let the coin jar mount up. Perhaps when it reaches four figures we'll have a free holiday or something üòÄ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank My coin jar has over ¬£150 in it now - been doing it manually since May and switched on automatic roundups as soon as the feature was available.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @LuxuryTravelled @AnneBoden Ok, thanks for confirming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @LuxuryTravelled @AnneBoden Slightly disappointed at that news. In the Twitter Q&amp;A before Christmas, I'm sure Anne mentioned in-app digital cheque imaging was coming in early 2019 üòï<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jajayourlife Any dates for the early access launch yet?  Looking forward to this :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy New Year to all my family and friends. Best wishes for 2019 üçæ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @itisJames I have also submitted some recently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you very much @StarlingBank, delighted to receive this package today containing socks, chocolate and a personal message! I've exhausted my hearts but continue to recommend you to you friends and family. Keep up the good work üëçüèª #bestbank  https://t.co/iSSNkje4Xr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingForBiz @StarlingBank Is this available on Android too? I noticed it was released for iOS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saw @DefLeppard at Newcastle @MetroRadioA on Sunday. Absolutely superb #hysteria  https://t.co/mdqN86E6P9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kirstie72120932 @StarlingBank Works fine for me - what is the problem?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank I've switched this option on and think it's great - very well implemented. One improvement would be to add an option to round up ALL transactions, not just card purchases, i.e. Direct Debits, Standing Orders, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @JoshSteveo DM on its way shortly... üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Seems as though there was an issue with the splash screen. Once fixed, I think it would be worth forcing it to appear next time people open the app, otherwise many users may not be aware of the round up feature or how to enable it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @JoshSteveo Really?!?! I'm on 4 hearts, will refer someone else ASAP! üòÉ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@humpinpumpkin @StarlingBank I've also been doing this manually and have saved just under ¬£130 since May üëçüèª  I believe this new automated round-up is for card transactions only, so I'll continue to move the change after my DDs and SOs leave my account.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank I've found how to turn it on (by editing my Goal) but I didn't get the splash screen telling me about this new feature. I'm on Android (Google Pixel 2).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Fantastic news! So happy you've added this feature üòÉüëçüèª<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @OnedoxInfo When will this appear in the Marketplace?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Thanks. I've actually just submitted a message to CS through the app.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank I've just accidently re-categorised every transaction relating to all of my accounts as "savings". I expected it to only apply to the particular account I was dealing with, i.e. a savings account.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Two bits of feedback... firstly, the options to apply to all or just one transaction are hidden from view. Secondly, and more importantly, it applies to all past transactions for a payee across all their accounts. This is incorrect, it should apply to a particular account.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chateaugimat @StarlingBank Most banks levy fees on business customers, Starling don't. Most banks charge a sizeable fee for sending foreign currency, Starling has one of the lowest fees. Most banks don't have nearby payments.  Regardless, they are celebrating what they have achieved in the last 6 months.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Very happy with round-ups and the full screen message introducing new features is long overdue - great news! Perhaps a full screen message could be used to re-introduce the swipe up for transactions...?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chateaugimat @StarlingBank In the last 6 months? Er, joint accounts, business accounts, Post Office deposits, young people's accounts, loans, transaction search, USD payments, nearby payments, ... üò≤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank I'd love to see Chromebook support. Just allowing the Android app to run on Chrome OS would be great.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThePaul_T @StarlingBank Hi Paul, I believe Starling have said that this will be ready early next year üëçüèª<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoeCMerriman @StarlingBank Me too, can't wait!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @AnneBoden I'm delighted with this, thank you! Incidentally, I've managed to save around ¬£117 by rounding up the pennies manually since May!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @AnneBoden Thanks Anne. Can you confirm if a change round up feature and in-app cheque imaging are in the pipeline? These are very high up on my wishlist! #AskStarling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @AnneBoden Hi Anne. Firstly, congratulations on a fantastic product. I switched all my banking to Starling back in May and am a very happy customer!  What are the number one priorities being worked on by the development team? What new features can we expect to see soon?  #AskStarling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@N26_Support No response and it's now been 6 days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@N26_Support I sent one earlier but didn't get any help. As it's now been 5 days and I'm still not verified, feel free to cancel my application. Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@N26UK Been waiting since Thursday for you to verify my ID. Happy for you to cancel my application if that's easier.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@N26_Support Any chance you could check my application to make sure there's nothing holding it up? I've waited two full business days plus the whole weekend. If there's an issue with my ID, I'd like to know sooner rather than later so I can take better photos of my driving licence. Thank you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@N26_Support Ok, thanks for your response. I'm disappointed as I know of a lot of people who signed up after me but have been verified already, some even got confirmation on Saturday or Sunday. Frustrating after waiting months for early access üòï<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reformattday @StarlingBank I don't hand mine over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@N26_Support could you please give me an update on my ID verification? I signed up on Thursday evening and am still waiting for my ID to be confirmed. Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@n26 @N26UK I attempted to sign up on Thursday but it's been stuck at ID verification since then ‚òπÔ∏è<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhoneServer @StarlingBank If you ever need your number, remember it is shown in the app under the "Card" menu item üëçüèª<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reformattday @StarlingBank I agree on joint account cards, time for a nice new colour! With regards cashiers putting your card in the machine, I would never hand your card over. Always insist on having the machine brought to you. Can't be too careful!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@N26UK I signed up Thursday evening but am still waiting for my ID to be verified. When can I expect to hear from you? Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @CornishTD Great to hear this is being worked on. Any plans to publish an updated roadmap?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank I rarely carry cash, which is frustrating when I find somewhere that doesn't accept cards, e.g. fast food vans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @TomREdwards I'm delighted to read this! I've wanted this feature for some time and was under the impression it wasn't being worked on. Great stuff üëçüèª<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterJa30222260 @StarlingBank I really hope that old card is cancelled? Bit of a security issue there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @SunnvaBitch I've just submitted a bug report through the in-app messaging system. A dedicated method of submitting feedback and bug info would be really useful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanWragg @StarlingForBiz @StarlingBank @Xero @PostOffice It's in the latest Android app update - not sure about iOS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingForBiz @StarlingBank @Xero @PostOffice And now it looks like overdrafts for Business accounts too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcusbrig I think it's more likely that this proves negotiations were being controlled by number 10 rather than Raab or his predecessor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @PaymentsAwards Congratulations, well deserved! üëçüèª  https://t.co/lEZBqsB9fn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @AnneBoden @VarietyGB @CatherineAwards Congratulations @AnneBoden!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @mcmarsh @StarlingForBiz No, that's correct. There's a 0.3% fee to deposit cash into a business account at the Post Office. This is subject to a ¬£3 minimum. So anything up to ¬£1,000 has a fee of ¬£3, anything above is 0.3% of the total deposit amount, e.g. ¬£1,500 would be ¬£4.50.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @PostOffice I'm really pleased with this announcement, great stuff üëçüèª One piece of advice... I've read a few comments from people who seem confused over the fee for depositing cash into a business account. It would be better to word it as, "0.3% per transaction with a minimum fee of ¬£3".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pwatsonuk @StarlingBank The chip needs to be updated to allow it to work with PO systems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chateaugimat @StarlingBank @zuffle @PostOfficeNews Hi Peter. There's a 0.3% fee, minimum ¬£3, for depositing cash into a business account. No fees on personal accounts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@southcoastbloke @StarlingBank Yes, it's instant üëçüèª Card in reader, enter PIN, cash available!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeffpovey @StarlingBank Hi Jeff, I suspect those that have reported having their accounts frozen may have been up to no good... üôÑ Bank accounts get frozen when fraudulent activity is suspected. I've been with Starling around a year, six months since I switched all my banking to them. Very happy here üëçüèª<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @LauraPulling Laura, lock your card in-app then use the live chat facility to speak to a customer service agent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @Themanwidnoname @jslee This is a fantastic addition to an already great banking product üëçüèª<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkKCurtis @StarlingBank I suspect cash deposits via the PO could be coming next week. When you say "bigger transfer amounts than ¬£250", what do you mean?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @PhoneServer I predict Monday... üôÑüòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmarcjones @StarlingBank Why would you need two accounts to manage your finances? Not being funny, genuinely not sure why you would need that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CricPrasen According to the laws of the game, the bowler is indeed considered a fielder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@N26UK been waiting for a loooong time for my beta invite. Any idea when I can expect it? Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @barnsguy Try using your card with your PIN, then try Google Pay again. I've seen in the past (with other banks) that occasionally you need to do a physical card transaction as an extra layer of security.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rambling_Tweets @StarlingBank You can deposit cash at any Nat West branch - no fees.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neilmortonnet @JoeCMerriman @StarlingBank No, surely that means they have 1,625 customers who have a Goal called "Christmas"? Starling Bank actually have around 300,000 customers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Coin jar (for round-ups, hint hint...), Holiday, Christmas. Also, I have one called "Overdraft Buffer" - this is so if I creep into my overdraft I'm not actually charged, up to the amount I have in this Goal üëçüèª<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goforsergei @LuxuryTravelled @StarlingBank @JoeCMerriman Love it! üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuxuryTravelled @StarlingBank @goforsergei @JoeCMerriman Is it a canvas shopping bag? I have one of those! üòÄ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @goforsergei @JoeCMerriman Joe, you already have every bit of merch Starling have ever had made. What else could you need?!?! üòú<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @Cammers_ This is a feature I really would love to see. I currently round up manually (saved over ¬£100 since May). Many competitors have this feature, I really think it would be a really good addition to the Starling app.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @xLITTLETOMMYx In-app cheque imaging would be my number one feature request. A large competitor (ahem) had promised this feature early next year, so I really hope it's being developed by Starling ü§ûüèª<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank I switched to Starling Bank in May and love it! However, I really want to see in-app digital cheque imaging and an aware that a competitor has promised this functionality by early next year. Would love to see Starling offer this so I don't need to look elsewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Also responded. Best of luck, Starling is by far the best of the new challenger banks IMHO üëçüèª<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Whatever you use to schedule your Tweets, I do not think it works the way you think it works... üòØ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank I submitted some more merchant improvements in-app almost two weeks ago - submitted them multiple times (and again just now) yet they never get updated. I was told they were done at least weekly. Could someone please take look? Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @JLWarlow @firstdirect @HSBC_UK Does that mean the feature is being developed or not?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @JourneysinM41 Could do with an updated roadmap...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarrenAshley @StarlingBank Happy to help Darren üòÉüëçüèª<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @thorntog Hi Guy, Starling recently introduced the Current Account Switch Service for joint accounts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @isamutlib @AnneBoden Hi ISA, Starling actually pay interest on positive balances - 0.5% AER on the first ¬£2,000 and 0.25% on everything above that up to ¬£85,000 üëçüèª<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank @DarrenAshley Hi Darren, Starling Bank aren't part of the Link network so your card won't work in Link-only machines. It will work in any machine that bears the MasterCard logo.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Thank you üëçüèª<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Great timing... I guess your Customer Services team will be inundated now as the forum is no longer a place for customers to get information.  https://t.co/N2If4vi0Hm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Oh, and I noticed your farewell post was originally titled "See ya peeps" before it was edited. A nice touch... very disrespectful towards some of the most loyal and engaged members of your customer base.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarlingBank Very disappointed and a very poor decision. Competitors are able to maintain an online community without putting customer's money or privacy at risk. You clearly didn't like the feedback and constructive criticism. Such a shame.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Barclaycard Is there any reason why you don't support Google Pay?  iPhone users get to use their Barclaycards through Apple Pay yet Android users are neglected.

<|startoftext|>@onion2k @JustEatUK But they do charge restaurants - 13% commission I believe. They increased the charge last year from 12% leading to revenue of ¬£375m and pre-tax profit of ¬£91m, up ¬£57m from the previous year. All without administering a "service charge" for customers who didn't pay by card.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I won't be using @JustEatUK again following the new "service charge" announcement. Pretty unethical to skirt around the card surcharge ban by introducing a new charge. Treating their customers with contempt.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rustyrockets Great gig tonight, cried with laughter! You should have chinned that knob Lewis lol :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jellyyyx That Lewis was a tosser!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sitting in row V with @loug78 waiting for@rustyrockets to come on. So excited my dinkle is tingling! #newbw2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Good attacking line up for Sunderland - glad Brucey's taking the cup seriously. 3-0: 2 goals for @DB11TT, 1 for Gyan. Ha'way the lads! #safc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someone tell Wenger that a minimum of 4 mins is just that - A MINIMUM. If the ref wants to add 4 1/2 mins, he'll signal a minimum of 4 #safc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well deserved goal for @DB11TT today - worked hard up front on his own and was in exactly the right place at the right time. Ha'way the lads<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Let's not forget the youngsters - Welbeck scored twice for the U21s, one assisted by Jordan Henderson #safc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Over the moon for @DB11TT, hope you can bang some more in on Saturday vs Wigan!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidBGJones Definitely not Adam Johnson, he was superb tonight.  He has to start for England IMHO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidBGJones @SAFCofficial I don't think there have been many, pretty sure Shack would have been the last.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SAFCofficial @DavidBGJones Was it Len Shackleton?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get in @DB11TT!  Lovely finish :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@raynersullivan @Teg410 A lot of people have me confused with someone else - I'm not a US football coach :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>How amazing is this video?  http://vimeo.com/14173983<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wonder how many Man Utd will put past Newcastle?  2 already, I reckon 5 :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DB11TT Congrats on the England call up - now is the time to cement your place in the squad. All the best!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@onion2k Agreed - @timminchin is a genius... saw him last year at City Hall, got tickets for the Arena in December :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@malcuk Good stuff!  Hot Fuzz is another of my favourite films.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulOBrien I saw that on Top Gear too - doubt I'll ever be able to afford a ¬£170k car though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shaun of the Dead... never get tired of watching this film :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Soupytwist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timminchin Dunno why I do this... I have the DVD but will be watching on E4.  Meaning I have to watch ads.  Why would I do that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@malcuk it's not placebos in general that I'm opposed to, it's homeopathy. Far more expensive than a sugar pill, yet just as ineffective.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I demand snake oil be made available on the NHS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This infuriates me, especially given the cuts that are being enforced across government departments:  http://bit.ly/flim-flam #homeopathy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely love this song by @timminchin - You Grew On Me  http://youtu.be/frNpdG4F9mw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well worth it though - Toy Story 3 is a great film! And a bit weepy at the end :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IMAX was sold out, so was Cineworld, but saw it in 3D at the Empire. 36 mile round trip to get to a cinema 50 yards from where I live!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Toy Story 3 today in full IMAX awesomeness!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> http://tweetphoto.com/31554512 @jimmycarr What a green room!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>COME ON ENGLAND!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well done Ghana - good result.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is mental... Isner v Mahut at Wimbledon.  2-2 in sets, 41-41 in the fifth and final set!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice one England - an improvement on the last two games, still some way to go but we're through.  Job done.  Come on Ghana!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very interesting theory from Graeme Souness regarding why England have been absolute rubbish...  http://bit.ly/cuJ8Iz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can't beat a nice cuppa at half four in the morning... :s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really bad insomnia tonight.  Haven't been to bed, now it's light outside!  Ah well, might as well get ready...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RIVEROS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cracking save Tommy!  Nice to see some entertaining football. #worldcup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@serafinowicz Bugger o**<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidBGJones Regardless of how frustrated he feels, what he said was out of order. People have paid a fortune to watch that rubbish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tony_Jeffries Yeah, they caught it on camera as he was walking off the pitch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rooney, you're a disgrace - if that's what you think you can get on the next plane home.  Knob. #england #worldcup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ABSOLUTE RUBBISH #england #worldcup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From BBC Sport yesterday: "Rooney has suggested even an under-par England can beat Algeria in Cape Town" #talkingbollocks #england #worldcup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If that substitution was our best option then we're screwed #england #worldcup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigBoyler That's offensive to Carlton Palmer!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are clueless... this is painful to watch :( #england #worldcup<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DavidBGJones I can't imagine it getting any worse, but we've got 45 minutes to screw it up completely...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Schofe SHITE is closer to the mark...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am completely underwhelmed so far... COME ON MAN!!! #england #worldcup<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What a goal... #brazil #worldcup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>only ¬£2 for a wide range of wonderful spanish cuisine -  http://www.groupon.co.uk/in/.WMlXgY/,21858?nlp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PStanton No, it's not just you... :s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Elsey_Who_Else Exactly what I've just said... Heskey is a complete donkey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Entire goal to aim at, he picks the one spot where the keeper is standing - cheers Emile #donkey #england #worldcup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Based on our first half performance, any optimism I had left after Heskey was included in the squad has been well and truly sapped away :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We've switched off... shocking defending :s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulOBrien Thankfully I'm watching on trusty old standard def. Freeview :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>GET IN!!!!!!! #goal #england #worldcup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>COME ON ENGLAND!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tony_Jeffries Put a bet on 2-0 earlier... got Lampard for first goal as well.  COME ON!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jason_Manford Whoever did that is a knob.  Still, at least you're a world record holder, so it's not all bad news! ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From @engadget:  http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/10/motorola-wants-a-2ghz-android-by-years-end-so-do-we/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goldenoldenlady If he was genuinely concerned he could have spoken to Corden off stage - no need to belittle him in front of the audience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@techno_t Cheers mate :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amazed at how many people think what Patrick Stewart said and did was funny, and that in some way James Corden had it coming. #glamourawards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stephenfry felt sorry for James though, he appeared pleased that Patrick wanted to speak to him... until he opened his mouth #glamourawards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Taking Katie to see Fantastic Mr Fox at the cinema - I love these ¬£1 weekend deals!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>New blog post: Gutted For Darren Bent -  http://bit.ly/cVCg4n<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DB11TT Gutted for you mate, just hope you keep your chin up and prove them wrong by banging more goals in for us next season. #dbforengland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Typically, the FA's squad announcement has turned into a complete farce.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidBGJones I hope you're right about Bent. Seems to have his head screwed on, but it must be very demoralising - what more can he do?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thefadotcom Confirmation isn't really needed though - what a shambolic way for the news to get out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stevo_football I'll be gutted for Bent if he doesn't make it. Don't judge him on 45 mins in a friendly, judge him on 24 PL goals!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@worldcupmotty Hope you're right with those 7. It's shocking that 24-goal Bent could miss out based on 45 mins with no service against Japan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got to wait 28 days for my TV to be repaired... no World Cup for me :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't believe my telly is broke!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@joannekernen Spoke about it before, but we have to get tickets to a tournament this year!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joannekernen Defo, and I didn't like his reaction there. A very frosty interview and disrespectful walking out before Selby got his trophy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great game - would have liked to see Ronnie go for the snookers in that last one, but well done to Selby.  Thoroughly enjoyed that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@omid9 Can't believe Ronnie attempted to cut that green back!  Been a great match.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joannekernen Nutcase!  No way should he have tried to cut that back!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joannekernen lol, hold your horses!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joannekernen What a shot by Ronnie - putting the cue ball in the jaws of the pocket!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joannekernen He's definitely got the momentum.  Taking on that red on the cushion was a bad mistake by O'Sullivan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Enjoying the Masters final.  Ronnie's been cracking but Selby's putting up a good fight.  Looks like a tight finish!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joannekernen Well, it's pretty bad!  I know what you mean though.  Just hope we have some players back in time for the trip to Everton.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@joncraddock Haha, there's more where that came from my friend!  Have a look at my Flickr...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>On a half day today, going for drinks in Durham this afternoon with my buddy Len :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@player112345 I know, what a day for football!  I won ¬£30 for Bent scoring the first goal and another ¬£40 for the 1-0 win :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@player112345 Alright mate!  Doing well thanks.  Great game today, we were all over them.  Hope the family are all doing well, send my love.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha'way the lads!  Lovely goal #DBTheTruth, clever use of the Liverpool beach ball :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RT @DerrenBrown RT @charltonbrooker  Jan Moir manages to walk the difficult tightrope between being a bitch and a c**t   http://bit.ly/1GGI4S<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All this rubbish about Rio Ferdinand being one of the best defenders in the world... he's not even one of the best defenders in Manchester.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Having a pint during the interval at the Royalty. My brother's in Bones... fantastic play, really enjoying it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DBTheTruth Feel gutted for you Darren... keep your chin up, you're gonna be the Premier League's top scorer this season #DBforEngland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What am I doing here...?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eddieizzard Congratulations Eddie, that's a magnificent achievement!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha'way the lads!  http://twitgoo.com/3a9lt L:  http://tr.im/yvDl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@11_TheTruth I've got money on you scoring the first goal today, good luck :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting ready to go to the match with Katie. Pub lunch first though :) Hopeful of a good win today.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Elsey_Who_Else LOL, did you make him run round the table with his pants round his ankles? That's the usual rule when you're seven-balled :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fire alarm went off earlier, had to evacuate the building with Katie in her pyjamas! Back in the apartment now :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think I'll watch "The Damned United" before bed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see it's official, we've signed Michael Turner from Hull.  Great signing IMHO.  Ha'way the lads! #safc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jay_Mullen Great idea!  I love buying.  Make it 13:30 and you've got a deal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jay_Mullen WAIT!  I'm also hungry, so hold your horses and we'll come up with a plan whereby I can eat too...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timminchin Has to be YGOM... it spread through me like malignant melanoma! #minchinlive<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Off to bed now... know I'm gonna have trouble sleeping, but will just have to force my eyes closed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lilyroseallen NeedAPresent.com  http://www.needapresent.com/gifts/orgasmatron<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PStanton Really disappointed at that... arguably the worst team we've played so far this season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gutted :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jay_Mullen I had Subway for lunch... mmmmm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PStanton Hehe, your outlook really does surprise me... :p<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great article on James Randi:  http://bit.ly/5Lui6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking forward to the match today... beat Stoke and we could be third in the Prem!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@onion2k That theme tune is one of the greatest songs ever written and still brings a tear to my eye.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Glinner Do you want faults relating to any part of Windows in particular?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on England, let's wrap this series up today!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Off to Mummy's with Katie for Sunday lunch now... looking forward to it :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PStanton WOW!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just in case anyone tries to phone me, I don't have a phone at the moment.  Should have a temporary handset tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Took Katie to the hospital today, glad she doesn't need grommets... yet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Start of the new Premier League season today and I can't wait!  Hope and expect Sunderland will get off to a flying start.  Ha'way the lads!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cracking goal from Defoe, good work lad!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on West Brom!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Your right leg I like - it's a lovely leg for the role. I've got nothing against your right leg. The trouble is, neither have you."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching the sketch "One Leg Too Few" by Peter Cook and Dudley Moore (again!)... absolutely fantastic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RT: @RichardWiseman: Stunning  http://bit.ly/BtcZA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2-0... ha'way the lads! Get Bent in tomorrow and I think we'll be looking good for this season :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn swine flu! The Tamiflu has made me feel sick over the last couple of days. Seem to be on the mend though, should be back to work Thurs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidBGJones Will be increasingly hard for them the longer Ashley's there. No interest in success on the pitch so no manager 'til he's gone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidBGJones The Mags have more chance of going down than coming straight back up... they'll be every team's cup final!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Elsey_Who_Else LOL! You'll have to come to the SOL this season, there's bound to be a banner with your name on it :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@serafinowicz Phil Silvers will have to come back from the dead before they can do a new series :p<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got Katie's season ticket yesterday, just waiting for mine to arrive now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@db10thetruth Good luck at Sunderland Darren, hope all goes smoothly with the medical. Will you be putting pen to paper tomorrow?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Subway... mmmm!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Enjoyed "The Wizard of Oz" at the Sunderland Empire tonight.  Well done to my brother Jay and the rest of the cast - great show!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mcuk Hehe, nah, I think he got out at the top!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Back to work today although I'm still not well... it hurts when I swallow and I'm practically deaf :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Off sick with flu at the moment, don't feel at all well :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Upgraded my web servers from RedHat to CentOS 5.2 yesterday.  Got a few minor issues to iron out but on the whole surprisingly painless.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@onion2k There are too many to choose from!  Anything by Spandau Ballet, or maybe Cutting Crew's "I Just Died in Your Arms Tonight".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A glass of red I think, in a nice new wine glass :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good win tonight - 7-3, two goals for me, lots of good shots saved and kept out by the woodwork.  All in all a good game of football.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mcuk Sweet niblets!  Trust you to get there first!  Ah well, sorry for caring - next time I'll let you find out the hard way :p<|endoftext|>
