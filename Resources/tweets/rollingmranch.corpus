<|startoftext|>@AP_Politics What voting systems are used in PA, WI, MI, GA, NC, NV, AZ? Has this been resolved and Americans not told?   https://t.co/tVRm8QYH6w<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guypbenson Guess this has been resolved ..  https://t.co/tVRm8QYH6w<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guypbenson Guy - you need to research the Bush vs Gore election and the flip flop the media did (along with Al Gore) over 1700 ballots in ONE COUNTY in Florida.  THIS IS MUCH BIGGER THAN THAT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewYorker @JasonSilva Ex-President Trump .... will be the ENEMY OF DEMOCRATS  Better beware of what happens from NOW until January 20th.    Last transition period @JoeBiden SIGNED A FISA WARRANT to spy on Trump former campaign AND set in motion the MICHAEL FLYNN FALSE RUSSIAN story  My 🍿 is waiting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you @realDonaldTrump for FIGHTING FOR AMERICA! This election is NOT OVER<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BurgessOwens @KLoeffler PATRIOTS -  DO NOT LET THESE TWO SENATE SEATS GET STOLEN AGAIN!

<|startoftext|>@AP @twitter - since WHEN DOES A NEWS ORGANIZATION VALIDATE THE VOTES IN EACH STATE?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AP I guess people forget that these results are not final... review the Bush vs Gore results and FLIP FLOP the media had to do.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Nope....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BusyDrT DEAD VOTERS do not vote... but if ballot sent to registered persons, SOMEONE ELSE SURE AS HELL COULD<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@COVID19Tracking Do you verify the dates of the TEST vs REPORTED DATE to verify that they are not over 14 days from testing to reported POSITIVE case- INCLUDING DUPLICATE Positive tests of the SAME PERSON?   Data is IMPORTANT, but needs to be TIMELY AND RELIABLE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charlesornstein @LisaGray_HouTX Sorry but the 4 deaths reported today were from 3-4 WEEKS AGO in Houston... None from this week.   Those 1100 deaths are from most likely LAST MONTH and do NOT reflect the current rate of death occurring.    Do not UNDERSTAND why these cannot be reported on a more timely manner!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill Good - @JohnJamesMI SHOULD NOT CONCEDE!! The election results need to be verified and DETROIT VOTES REVIEWED BY REPUBLICAN POLL WATCHERS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would go down in history as the BEGINNING OF US’ 2nd CIVIL WAR<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@joshuamings @anewman35 @chicagotribune In Houston - the following deaths reported YESTERDAY: 1 from August 1 from September  1 - 3wks ago 2- 2wks ago 1 - last week (Oct 28)   NONE FROM THIS WEEK.  https://t.co/obiU6FNPJD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshuamings @anewman35 @chicagotribune Show me HOW I am deluded?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course!!! Why should Virginia be ANY DIFFERENT from ANY OTHER DEMOCRATIC STATE?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alsosusieq2 Assuming much?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anewman35 @chicagotribune I DO PAY ATTENTION... these DEATHS ARE NOT ALL FROM YESTERDAY   But if you make that statement- MUST ALSO REPORT THE DATES THE DEATHS OCCUR- people DO NOT GO GET THIS INFORMATION THEMSELVES FROM LOCAL HEALTH DEPT...   Stop avoiding FACTS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chicagotribune What are the dates of those 97 deaths? And those 9935 tested when?   Important questions that are USUALLY very skewed to look bigger than the situation TODAY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alsosusieq2 The vote lead NOT that large to call... Cancelled ballots being reported now by many Republicans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alsosusieq2 So WHY was it called then? Why NOT retract it now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I guess THIS GUY @arnonmishkin is who @TuckerCarlson SAID NEEDS TO BE FIRED<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Registered Democrat called Arizona EARLY FOR #Biden ...   Hmmmmm, maybe he KNEW WHERE THE #CorruptDemocrats WERE PLANNING HARD TO WIN<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TamaraDemocrat And please POST FLU AND COLD CASES WITH DEATHS TOO!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@joebiden #RIPBreonnaTaylor is ruined BECAUSE OF YOH AND @KamalaHarris<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ciara ... and HOW DOES BREONNA GET 6 BULLETS   Yet HER BOYFRIEND GETS 0?   How about because he USED HER AS A BODY SHIELD?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ciara I thought she was an active EMT AND WAS ASLEEP IN BED?!!   Both ended up NOT TRUE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ciara You @Ciara are ONE of those “celebrities” the #Louisville AG talked about   SHAME ON YOU for thinking YOU KNOW MORE than the Grand Jury<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@benandjerrys #JusticeForBreonnaTaylor should NOT BE ABOUT SELLING ICE CREAM...   Shameful to use #Breonna for YOUR COMMERCIAL PURPOSE<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MSNBC @TheLastWord  ABSOLUTELY NO MENTION THAT TWO POLICE OFFICERS HAVE BEEN SHOT BY PROTESTERS IN #LouisvilleProtests   YOU ARE PART OF THIS PROBLEM!!!   #mediabias #NoJusticeNoPeace #Biden #SayHerName #Trump2020LandslideVictory  #BlackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikkoAlanne You need professional help...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TechDanni @LeviP34 @StepUpMom @Donbob01 @RyanAFournier Both Breonna and BF were in the hall ... key facts that were missed at the beginning of this media frenzy - she was NOT ASLEEP.   Sad to see media frenzy continuing to STIR THE POT on this one and NOT FOCUS on the reason there was a warrant in the first place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joshson80OBZ @tiredAmerican16 @Donbob01 @RyanAFournier So why exactly were that many bullets fired and ONLY BREONNA HIT?! Hmmmm? Maybe used as a human shield<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Houstopian @TexasTribune @rossramsey Then you are obviously NOT a Republican ... ORANGE MAN BAD!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeviP34 @Donbob01 @RyanAFournier My $$ on the facts that the Grand Jury had that said no indictment ... and will be used for the trial against the officer   Wish this many people would care about #ChicagoKillings and all the young kids lives lost to gang violence and #KnowTheirNames<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Donbob01 @RyanAFournier Then I guess YOU did NOT watch the AG talk ... there was a WITNESS that they knocked and announced themselves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanAFournier Reading the comments... so she was sleeping with her EX boyfriend?! Where was CURRENT boyfriend when this all happened?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Donbob01 @RyanAFournier Her boyfriend had a GLOCK and was just protecting her?! Good try<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanAFournier The reason Breonna had 6 bullets and her boyfriend had none was ...   HE USED HER AS A SHIELD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Houstopian @TexasTribune @rossramsey Yeah, cause that’s ALL REPUBLICANS TALK ABOUT...  👌👌👌 🤡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acambriaauthor @AP Government NOT thinking of how people are struggling... not everyone can afford a NEW CAR or even a USED electric car ... not cheap! #California people moving to Texas in droves and I wish they could stay there<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@seanhannity CORRECTION: Actually the indictment had nothing to do with shooting Breonna Taylor ... but rather firing into the neighbors apartment where 3 people lived (thus 3 counts)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fuller_kiley @NTerryEllis @courierjournal Did you miss the CRIMINAL PART of the warrant??!! Called Harboring a known criminal   Boyfriend probably used her as a human shield<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PoojaOnTV @SylvesterTurner Why has NO ONE showed a graph of the deaths on days AS REPORTED VS AS OCCURRED?!! Seems pretty easy for a journalist to do and publish!  But would most likely NOT SHOW 18 or 23 deaths ever in one day... thus get shut down - cause gotta KEEP SCHOOLS CLOSED!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billkellytexas @SylvesterTurner Has ANYONE figured out the reason Hispanic population is more AT RISK? No papers or studies??!! I feel like this is systemic racism against Hispanics!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamirBecic @SylvesterTurner @GregAbbott_TX The death rate is 0.013% of the population...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jerry_grey2002 @GordonGChang jerry - prove it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No it’s most likely ALLERGIES .... that is why the testing rates are only 10-20% positive ... meaning 80% ARE NEGATIVE (MEANING NOT COVID-19!!)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GregAbbott_TX waiting for some guidance from the top as to whether @SylvesterTurner MASK FINE will be upheld.    Death rate in Harris County is 766/6,000,000 or 0.013% from COVID-19.  A $250 fine is excessive and unnecessary, especially for unemployed.   #Covid_19 #Houston<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmatthews1065 @SylvesterTurner It’s not nonsense ... it’s just NOT LEGAL to fine someone for something that will not make this virus disappear- only worldwide isolation (not possible) or worldwide eradication will do that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SylvesterTurner @ArtAcevedo ... maybe THIS 👇 is WHY people don’t trust the “mask fine” ... goal post changing based on your political winds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2texasmom @motherofmarines @SylvesterTurner With CHLORINE in the pool water!! Unless they have a “study” now that pools spread THE VIRUS! 😂   People keep swimming and getting Vitamin D!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nsquaredcrypto @SylvesterTurner Agree - I am not an anti-masker either - but DO NOT WANT the Mayor to fine people for having civil liberties taken away either! If NOT at risk, then keep on living.  The more rapidly the virus spreads the faster we gain immunity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SylvesterTurner Is there a FINE FOR THESE PARTIES?! Arrests for transmission coming next? This is getting ridiculous. Has the death rate gone above 0.015% of the population yet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Texasgemi @katieoc02635119 @IrishGoddess8 @SylvesterTurner Melissa - PLEASE KEEP WEARING A MASK! But I do not want to be TOLD when I HAVE to wear a mask! Adult here.

<|startoftext|>@MelanieLawson13 @SylvesterTurner So positivity rate has to do with total positive cases/total tests given; yet we have NO IDEA that these include second &amp; third+ tests of THE SAME PEOPLE! Also what about all the FAKE POSITIVES for people that leave before getting tested?!! FAKE NUMBERS LEAD TO LOCKDOWN!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HoustonChron @SylvesterTurner So if I say I am protesting wearing a mask then I do t have to pay the fine?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevenABC13 @SylvesterTurner Wow... the City must have told everyone @abc13 employee to post this ... OR ELSE! 🤡<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@shawntheverbose @SirWmWallace @NotAChaunce @DrEricDing @CAPAction Shawn.. so what about all the cases from Europe...how soon would Biden have cut off our top Allies traveling into NYC? This is a GLOBAL pandemic and the only person responsible is Xi from China for letting it get out of control and spread.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Completely true<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvanMcMullin You are a demented man - May God give you comfort in your hate of a wonderful man that deserves MORE than for you to use him for YOUR political win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HoustonChron Opinion: Why would the US Government let ANYONE know “their plan” for closing the Consulate?   So that it can be broadcast to CHINA??!! 🤔  Called “common sense” which is seriously lacking in “opinion” pieces these days<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danielle_ivory Because maybe the population of college age kids have NO SYMPTOMS other than a normal cold?!!   Please remember that SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus and 99.9% of college age students will not die from it and instead build the herd immunity NECESSARY to handle the virus in 2021<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SoonerSower @leolabeth @WesleyHuntTX @TwitterSupport And what I said is NOT medical misinformation- maybe it’s lab errors but rapid tests are NOT AS RELIABLE as nasal swab tests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SoonerSower @leolabeth @WesleyHuntTX @TwitterSupport That doctor is from Houston and as an African immigrant she brings with her many of her native customs that should not be dismissed b/c they sounds “strange”   Houston is a very balanced city of races and we should not cancel ppl for their odd beliefs -in H-town ALL PEOPLE MATTER<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SoonerSower @leolabeth @WesleyHuntTX @TwitterSupport Promoting self harm for telling Wesley Hunt to make sure to get retested as it may be a false positive?   Maybe people need to stop allowing only ONE SIDE of THOUGHT! This is AMERICA 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸🇺🇸Not China 🇨🇳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZubyMusic damn 18-39 yo just keep messing up the “death” percentages by testing positive and NOT DYING!!!!   rate will get to the same death % as flu, pneumonia, cancer and ALL the other reasons people 70+ die at a higher rate if we allow the healthy to contract it and build immunity<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@leolabeth @WesleyHuntTX @TwitterSupport My sister almost had a HEART ATTACK and nervous breakdown because of her false positive and then had to wait 5 days in self isolation waiting for the REAL RESULTS - not insignificant.    There is no way to stop a  extremely contagious virus unless it was stopped in Asia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Carma_2012 @WesleyHuntTX I am well versed on SARS-CoV-2 and knew where to look in my bookmarks - you on the other hand did nothing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Carma_2012 @WesleyHuntTX Is the result still a FALSE POSITIVE?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leolabeth @WesleyHuntTX @TwitterSupport Here is your participation trophy 🏆 also since we are “betting” here that I am a Trump troll - you do not support HCQ, zinc &amp; Zpac helps early cases of some SARS-Cov-2?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leolabeth @WesleyHuntTX @TwitterSupport  https://t.co/GPnG5OWTGR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Carma_2012 @WesleyHuntTX Vague and unscientific answer... it was Thermo Fisher test but any rapid test can lead to false positives or negatives - positives due to lab results having previously tested case virus still in testing chamber  https://t.co/GPnG5OWTGR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Codename_Dancer @WesleyHuntTX Maybe this is why you never tried out for Jeopardy... sorry to disappoint - live in Houston and Mr Hunt has 100% of my ACTUAL vote... if you wanted to &gt;verify my Twitter feed&lt;<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leolabeth @Codename_Dancer @WesleyHuntTX I am not a bot ... for all you NON TEXANS.  And a very enthusiastic $ and time supporter of Mr. Hunt.  He is a GREAT man that we need in DC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mtd83456703 @MissTips @WesleyHuntTX Fever - very important symptom for likely spread of ANY VIRUS ... if negative with no fever, then I would not assume you are positive and if symptoms subside a test does not really mean anything except to show that the spread is occurring (as it should and WILL)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Carma_2012 @YancyFaith @MissTips @Mtd83456703 @WesleyHuntTX So WHY get the test?!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WesleyHuntTX We NEED YOU!!! In prayers for you and all those near you!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bakerjjw @leahmcelrath @RepJerryNadler 1st - be respectful of a US Representative   2nd - Mr. Gohmert may not have enough active virus if no symptoms to spread it if keeping social distancing - MASKS do not work if taken OFF when SPEAKING!  3rd -  and Nadler needs to take care of WIFE! #NadlerResign<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nypost But the Black Lives Matter “mural” gets CLEANED UP **INSTANTLY** - just another @BilldeBlasio FAILURE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EddieZipperer @Johnny_Joey If you did not know the “you don’t want to engage” part, I TOTALLY heard “bitch” in some part of that sentence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SSK1ATX @PatrickGunnels @mamahashman @GregAbbott_TX Thank you for that article! I called BS the second I saw the story and tried to follow it for a few days in San Antonio news but then it just “went away” like I thought it would.  Great article!  Now waiting for the one about Nueces Co and all the babies getting COVID-distorted!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kanyewest 😍😍 that is what true friendship and love looks like ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBSThisMorning @carterevans WITHOUT LEGAL CAUSE??!! HahahahahahHahahahaha - all I see is a bunch of people destroying federal property<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@punmasterflash @GregAbbott_TX I do not need a name - I just want ONE PERSON to be interviewed that was a first hand account or actually went to the party... WHY are there not MORE people from this party that were infected and coming forward out of respect for their friend they lost??!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bldpj000 @GregAbbott_TX Just let me know more facts and I will gladly accept and promote it.  Do not believe we are in a catastrophic, end of times.  The more testing proves the death rate is closer to flu death levels.  Keep trying... 🏆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bldpj000 @GregAbbott_TX Then tell the DOCTOR to NOT go to the media and tell the vague story.   That is USING the family to tell a story... now THAT IS DESPICABLE!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Brittan91244986 @lauraapollo @GregAbbott_TX Thank you for that information! It’s becoming VERY DIFFICULT to find detail information regarding ANY story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CindyMccollough @GregAbbott_TX I’m sorry for your family having to go through this. My neighbor died in a nursing home and I do believe it’s a REAL VIRUS. I just don’t like disinformation being spread (like 18 deaths in one day in Houston) when the data isn’t current or true. Please stay safe &amp; healthy!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@allthingsal512 @HoustonChron Too much work to make your own money instead of taking from those that worked their ass off?? I have never known ONE CEO that just sits around doing nothing!   Risk = $$$REWARDS OR $$FAILURE  Paycheck = NO RISK = NO EXTRA REWARD   ... just ask any Hospitality CEO during Covid-19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuzieQdid @GregAbbott_TX Then DO NOT TELL THE STORY! Sorry but I don’t believe this story - too many other families telling their COVID stories and as soon as people started to question this one - POOF! it disappeared<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bldpj000 @GregAbbott_TX Which family?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GregAbbott_TX Sorry to inform you but testing positive is NOT A DEATH SENTENCE... and the SARS-COV-2 virus is NOT GOING TO DISAPPEAR if you wear a mask or hole up in your house for 2 weeks! I think those false narratives have been proven after 2 months shutdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>His shutdown due to him allowing all these protesters here to spread germs - Houston was FINE until this started! I will refuse his orders along with MANY HOUSTONIANS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hcphtx @HarrisCoJudge @ushahmd @ReadyHarris @abc13houston @KHOU @KPRC2 @FOX26Houston @HoustonChron @TelemundoHou @univision45TV So who is going to watch my kids so that I can work and feed my family?   This is NOT just about science BUT SURVIVAL of the larger population. &lt;350 deaths in 5 months is sad but NOT CATASTROPHIC as people not being able to work, pay rent and buy food<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lauraapollo @henrysmyboy @GregAbbott_TX If you @Laura Apollo was from these parts you would know that where the COVID Party death “occurred” was NOT NUECES COUNTY... that part of Texas is called a “border town” because it shares the “border” with Mexico ... but thank you for participating- here is your trophy 🏆<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@henrysmyboy @GregAbbott_TX No other details given other than he went to party and “last words” were “I made a mistake” ...was a 5 day story and hospital probably told the Dr to stop the DRAMA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HoustonHealth @HoustonOEM @HoustonTX @houmayor How many of these are people being tested for the 2nd &amp; 3rd time - but same case? I have heard that this number may also include “presumed” positives from contact tracing questions without testing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GregAbbott_TX This is an OLD STORY... with still NO name or family telling the same story.  No one should believe this story without family backing up the claim<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thehill I am PRETTY SURE those are “stand in” Mom’s!! Just told the older women in the crowd to put their mom shorts on 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HoustonChron Not.gonna.happen - CEO has more responsibilities than most of the top 5 VP’s and is the face of the company.  Anyone that takes that role on does not work a 8-5 job five days a week; works more like 6am - 10pm six days a week<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CBSThisMorning @GayleKing @BillClinton @HillaryClinton President Clinton DOES NOT LOOK WELL! Is @HillaryClinton drugging him?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpMex @SunshineDreame6 @TexasTribune So what makes up the difference between 1.19% and 0.013%? Total deaths/total Texas Population SHOULD BE the correct mortality rate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TexasTribune *REPORTED* does NOT EQUAL the date they OCCURED! 90% are 3-6 weeks OLD!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamalaHarris @SylvesterTurner Yeah, pretty sure that is NOT how laws are passed... that would be called a sympathy vote and not the reason WHY legislation should be passed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeBrem @HoustonHealth So Media is false when they reported on EVERY STATION that Houston had 18 DEATHS IN ONE DAY??!! I only see highest one day total of 7... that is a 61% false reporting rate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mgolds66 @DeAnna4Congress Never fear... those that help them will let them know. Those in the homeless population that just want to be left alone will NEVER get medical attention because they DO NOT WANT IT! Cannot change PEOPLE - only YOURSELF!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dallasnews Don’t pay attention to the DATES of those deaths reported “in a DAY”...90% are from MAY &amp; JUNE!!! 10% from 1st week of JULY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaptRonBRB @billkellytexas @SylvesterTurner This is why the Houston Health texts have STOPPED reporting death details ... “have to check the website”<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MarkDice WHY is this “mural” on the streets?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billkellytexas @SylvesterTurner Data shows: 7/11 (64% - over HALF!) of these “new” deaths are from June... 2/11 (18%) are from 1st week of July... ONE IS FROM THIS PAST WEEK!

<|startoftext|>@cd_hooks @TexasMonthly Good - may you keep your fearmonger writing going so that people become even MORE HYSTERICAL - deaths reported in Houston “in RECORD ONE DAY TOTAL” are NOT from any ONE day and 16/18 are from MAY/JUNE!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Forrest4Trees @TexasMonthly We are NOT NOT NOT on the “brink of disaster”... FEARMONGERING makes people disregard anything else said.  Yes, people are dying with pre-existing conditions but MOST PEOPLE ARE RECOVERING!!! Focus on FACTS NOT FEAR<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hiplobonoxa @milagros_lloret @CNN The deaths reported as NEW are from May &amp; June ... it’s all being manipulated by liberal cities.  Also not saying if people dying in hospitals right now are Covid or not.  Only 30% of all hospital beds are Covid patients<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hiplobonoxa @milagros_lloret @CNN Let me know how much the media talks about it AFTER THE ELECTION??!! It’s like the “case/death totals” have disappeared from the right corner of all broadcasts... because DEATH RATE is slowing and CASES GOING UP (meaning death rate getting closer to traditional flu levels)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN VIRUSES that have been spread globally are NOT GOING TO GO AWAY! Just mutate and continue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrLeanaWen @DrTomFrieden But for schools where the virus is NOT “exploding”.... why can we not send our kids back to school? What if parents CANNOT HOME SCHOOL??!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VABVOX That is NOT TRUE... a mask will not kill the virus - it’s NOT going away - just like the flu does not go away.  Have to gain exposure to it or develop a vaccine (which will not be generally available for 12+ months)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MrAndyNgo @occupycorruptDC All these groups could be busted by the IRS for tax evasion.  they are getting donations and not reporting how they are spending it.  Otherwise, it’s taxable income if they are not a charitable organization and the people are “donating” to their group<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Acyn Mayor obviously has NOTHING else to worry about in Atlanta!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeAngelisCorey @E__Strobel And maybe then our kids could keep up with Asia and European kids!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBSThisMorning Well we will need it after being locked up until 2022 since we cannot understand that the virus has spread and we must gain immunity to it - a vaccine will never be 100% effective and just like the flu never really goes away but just flares up every year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TexasTribune Reading all the “standard” attacks on Abbott and NO REAL facts...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hcphtx @ReadyHarris @ushahmd @abc13houston @KHOU @FOX26Houston @KPRC2 @HarrisCoPct2 @HarrisCoJudge @HarrisCoPct3 Normally there is a list of the deaths and when they occurred and the age/race/underlying issue/date of death published via tweet<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PlausibleUse @NateSilver538 If you do not want to get Sars-CoV-2 buy only a N95 mask - I am healthy and am watchful but know what to do if I happen to get it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PlausibleUse @NateSilver538 And I know MORE about SARS-CoV-2 than most people... and a MASK is only helpful if you have the virus and a vaccine is NOT going to be generally available for at LEAST 9-12+ more months - *if* ONE can be developed by anyone OTHER THAN CHINA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PlausibleUse @NateSilver538 I am an Independent voter... but will vote for Trump because my income has gone up, government LESS involved in my life AND most importantly- BIDEN IS NOT THE REAL NOMINEE...exactly WHY the DNC has not selected a VP candidate for him.

<|startoftext|>@hcphtx @ushahmd There is nothing discussing the “life cycle of the virus in this video<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BuzzFeed Was expected... Texas Democrats took out one of their own insiders in West for the “look” of Hegar.  Now let’s see how she does outside the Democratic bubble<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYGovCuomo Hard to rely on science when it’s ALL FUNDED BY CHINA!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sdelladonna However, cases now are not causing deaths in the 18-40 yo age group like they were to other groups in Mar/Apr/May.  No reason to shut down if not Covid deaths.  ICU may be “full” but only 20-30% are Covid-19 infected<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BilldeBlasio ... why do you change your name?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oops AGAIN!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trustnbtc @axidentaliberal @hossehenad @Screwyou451 @tedcruz  https://t.co/1Tx45somVT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SO THIS IS YOUR REAL INTENTION FOR YOUR TWEET??!! To get FUNDING?!   You are Pathetic- YOU SHOULD BE CANCELLED for shaming others for your gain!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hossehenad @tedcruz OMG! SCARY!! FACTS &amp; SCIENCE! If you get tested regularly for Sars-CoV-2, tests are negative, then a mask does nothing.  I am pretty sure Ted Cruz would not want the negative publicity if he tests positive later and had to contact trace to all these passengers. GROW UP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@axidentaliberal @hossehenad @Screwyou451 @tedcruz Do you have this in Adam Schiff parody form?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HaleyAVelasco @rebaker64 @Princeton Yet locking down everything for a year would not lead to population immunity...  the right answer is to protect those that need protection and let everyone else live and gain immunity- that is WHY those that are asymptomatic are so important<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC I am pretty sure that the guy doing the choke-hold on the cop was NOT just trying to feed his family.  Take your rose colored glasses off and STOP TALKING - get to Washington and actually DO SOMETHING! You and the “squad” are ALL TALK - NO RESULTS  Pass Phase 4 that works FOR ALL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC ...as you tweet from your $$$$ apartment (does not look too shabby on your videos) ... do you even live in your district or is it too dangerous for you now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC Real life example - man gets killed in your district while walking hand in hand with his daughter! What you doing about that?   This is about thugs killing people with NO PENALTY.  The PURGE is beginning in NYC - sad to watch!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lukewhorne That is VERY ONE dimensional.  Texas is MORE than just what football players (past or present) think - especially since most leave before they graduate and are not Alums.  Most Alumni do not want the song changed.  It’s a SONG... not a racist chant<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hcphtx @ushahmd Thank you for your reply.  Again, needs to be put at the FRONT of pandemic response - Bad (lagging) data leads to BAD DECISIONS. Public has NO IDEA what the current death rate is - which is most important part of this - because deaths are being reported with a 3 week lag.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hcphtx @ushahmd ABSOLUTELY NO REASON the data should be lagging so far behind! We live in a DIGITAL WORLD where everything can be automated. Medical records are all digital now. THIS IS ONLY A COUNTY LEADERSHIP ISSUE - PLEASE stop manipulating the data! Deaths should not take months to report!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hcphtx @ushahmd Who still has a fax machine??!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TexasTribune @AP @washingtonpost ... I have not seen the stories from your outlets on how BAD BEHAVIOR such as this is the ROOT CAUSE for community spread and thus the CATASTROPHIC RISE of COVID-19 ... no masks, no social distancing.  But a cop being harrassed makes this all ok?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FrankelJeremy @BonginoReport Fantastic news!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC @JulianCastro And your “anyways” will lead to MANY LOSS OF JOBS by Hispanics due to the boycott you both started<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC @JulianCastro Are you SURE it’s really going to be Julian??!!   It may just be his “fill-in” twin brother - like he did all the time in San Antonio?! Make sure he is not in two Zoom calls at the same time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC Seriously, have you ever eaten Goya foods?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyannaPressley @AOC @WhiteHouse That occupant is YOUR PRESIDENT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just wish she could retire and enjoy her life - WHY keep working when you are over 80?! Especially if you have $120,000,000+ #PelosiMustGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SwordsmithLRG @MagdaMtvergara1 @NBCNews Well it has also been reported that it’s more profitable to say it’s a death from COVID-19 than pneumonia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>93% had underlying conditions that you failed to mention - and these deaths could be from April &amp; May but just now being reported... need dates of death but they will not release that information since they are most likely 2 months old<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarthZapata @RudyGiuliani I thought LA was primarily run by Democrats!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dick_nixon And did those kids have underlying health conditions? If so, these same kids could die getting ANY illness and do NOT reflect the general population of that age group<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CountyofLA @lapublichealth Please provide date of death for these NEW 18 deaths ... many counties are delaying reporting of deaths by TWO MONTHS - these could be deaths from April &amp; May<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 Gave me goosebumps hearing The Pledge of Alliegence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stuff_so All died because China failed to contain a virus 🦠<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @Mike_Pence @BetsyDeVosED I guarantee you that every kid in China will be in school - they are just trying to make Americans even further behind in the education forum - stupid ignorant people are exactly what they want from us<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TexasTribune 269 deaths so far in Houston... those teachers may have a GREATER chance dying driving to school in their car or smoking a cigarette<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HoustonChron One death reported TODAY... FROM JUNE!! Hahahahaha - this is becoming a HUGE JOKE on killing Texas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HoustonChron HELL TO THE NO!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lyn449LG @DEBORAHMORTELL1 @AllOnMedicare @ddiamond Please send ... I cannot find ANYTHING in the San Antonio paper<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DEBORAHMORTELL1 @AllOnMedicare @ddiamond Where are the family members mourning the loss of their son and telling people NOT to go to a Covid Party?! Why would the family NOT want to come out and tell their sons story of how amazing he was when he was alive and how they will miss him now?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robert_chidgey @msheffi972 @HoustonHealth Are you tracking the dates too? I am SO TIRED of “new” cases being from TWO MONTHS ago! I think they are skewing the numbers to avoid people understanding when the deaths really occurred.  One of the “newly” reported from yesterday was from APRIL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nypost Where are the comments from her parents or siblings??!! I have heard ALOT of COVID-19 stories but they ALWAYS HAVE A NAME - especially AFTER the person dies.  FAKE NEWS until I have a name and family confirmation- San Antonio is too (D) to believe this is legit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TexasTribune Interesting that you guys know more than the County is reporting!!! In Harris County - we are ONLY reporting ”NEW” deaths from MAY and MID-JUNE! (Like from over 2 months and 1 month ago OLD) ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fake news....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump I LOVE GOYA FOODS!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chicagotribune Would anyone have expected otherwise?!! Crap in... Crap out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SylvesterTurner Interesting that you take 3 tweets to report all these OLD deaths! Not one new one...  MOST NORMAL PEOPLE INTERPRET “NEW” TO MEAN AT LEAST IN **THIS MONTH**!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealSaavedra @BonginoReport Trump just has TWO NEW VOTERS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NOPE... departing the White House would be the 1st obstacle!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TexasTribune Today’s ONE “newly reported” death in Houston is from MAY 16TH!!!!  That is almost 2 MONTHS OLD! #coronavirus #manipulateddata #FakeNewsMedia  https://t.co/W8mJtBbEUW<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@adamjones8350 @BuzzFeed ...and the “delicate sensitivity” of those offended by dead people and the need to tear down statutes?!  It’s way too easy to upset the left right now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you Mr Jones for being a true Patriot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KochIndustries2 @JamaalBowmanNY @IlhanMN No one - especially Jeff Bezos - owes anyone anything but a JOB! He used his brain and started from nothing to become a billionaire- just like EVERY other person in the USA. Lazy is as Lazy does... FACT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adamjones8350 @BuzzFeed Well it offended me!! I do not want public streets painted with Marxist rhetoric- so I am ok with it being painted over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TexasTribune What are your polling statistics? ALWAYS an important part of the narrative<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BuzzFeed Unless the people who painted it were also charged with a crime, then the prosecutors have zero chance of a conviction<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does a woman who immigrated from Africa and became a US Citizen decide that the US system is NOT GOOD ENOUGH and should be dismantled??!! Why did @IlhanMN even come to the United States if she thinks it’s broken??!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamaalBowmanNY @IlhanMN Take that issue up with Jeff Bezos ... he is part of the Democratic Party that you represent<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@M3atNTatorz @jendlouhyhc Have you checked to see how much solar panels cost?!! Last time I got a price it was &gt;$30,000 - I could “finance it” and get a “tax credit” which would offset the interest charges. JUST A SCAM to get other people rich at my expense! Also solar panels take HUGE ENERGY to produce<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nytimes Why does the NYT fall for Trump baiting you guys into keeping this story alive?! Wasn’t this like 2 weeks ago? How about report on all the tragic shootings in Chicago &amp; Atlanta or the NFAC in Georgia??!! Nope... let’s talk about an OLD (nonsense) STORY!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chicagosmayor Is Austin a neighborhood in Chicago?! If you mean the city in Texas, I think you just need to stay focused on your own kids getting killed and stop trying to deflect from your own lack of leadership in this fight to end gang violence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@texansocialist @Phil_Lewis_ Yes THEY do....when WHITE ANTIFA shows up all dressed in military grade gas masks and wearing military grade walkie talkies, expensive weapons like Seattle CHOP shit... it’s THE SAME FUNDING... they supply BOTH sides!! Stop being so ignorant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@texansocialist @Phil_Lewis_ Did ANYONE mention ANYTHING about white people?!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@secupp @secupp, I have been watching over America since WAY before you were a thought to your mother. America is FINE without your self righteous note.

<|startoftext|>@HoustonHealth @HoustonOEM @HoustonUmmc @TDEM @HoustonTX @houmayor The virus NEVER CLOSES ... why should testing stop?! If it’s that important and no one can do anything because it’s all shut down, WHY not keep testing sites OPEN??!!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realgloriamiles @TexasTribune What stats? Where does ANY DATA mention that the rise in cases is coming from BARS and not restaurants or beaches or protests?! Not ONE place I can find that mentions any facts - just assumptions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDSteinberg Its like Groundhog Day - every month!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope @DNC just TRYING ANOTHER try... same look - same characters involved! Just waiting to find out that @RepAdamSchiff and other Democrats were also briefed and trying to cover their tracks - all these stories LEAD BACK TO THE DEMOCRATS!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nypost Stimulus money hard at work!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BarackObama @JoeBiden I wonder how much of the money raised was REALLY raised and not just re-circulated through ACTRED? I thought 40 million were out of work... but let’s blow money to elect @JoeBiden who is sad to watch speak<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dylmcguinness @SylvesterTurner @AmyPeck @BenjaminEW Did you miss the statement today that said people should be going through their healthcare provider.. the testing sites should@only be for people with no health insurance<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RyanQualtrics @HoustonTX How will you keep our private information safe? You do not appear to be from Texas? Are there no Texas companies that @HoustonOEM @HoustonHealth @houmayor could have hired for contact tracing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you @SenatorTimScott for trying... Democrats - all talk NO ACTION @SpeakerPelosi @chuckschumer #BlackLivesMatter #AllInThisTogether #COVID__19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AzureSky111 @HoustonHealth Agree... dying of the virus that China could have stopped but refused to. And kept sending people ALL OVER THE WORLD for months... yet, you probably believe that China’s death count is still the LOWEST of all the countries in the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HoustonChron But will we ever hear how many were infected with COVID-19?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HoustonChron You are a part of the Marxist arm called BLM ... leave our city alone and stop the division<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@politicony Again... the MAIN REASON that mail in ballots CANNOT be permitted on day of... must be mailed in early! This is what leads to voter fraud.... and if Bowman loses, get ready for WWIII<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYGovCuomo @GovMurphy @GovNedLamont So @NYGovCuomo wants his state to fail even more! No travel to NY 😂... and guess is not smart enough to realize that states will just manipulate the data even more to be at 9.8% positive testing to stay under the 10% restrictions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrumpWarRoom So embarrassing... using George Floyd for political purposes only! @SenSchumer should apologize<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let me know when you take responsibility for your words from @TheView ...I get that you did not see it ..but how about asking some questions and investigate BEFORE YOU CALL PEOPLE SIMPLE MINDED?! America was for you!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@canary_contrary @Tigersruledude @HoustonHealth @HoustonTX @HoustonOEM @hcphtx @ReadyHarris @houmayor Deaths decreasing now but reporting appears slightly(sarcastically) distorted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@canary_contrary @Tigersruledude @HoustonHealth @HoustonTX @HoustonOEM @hcphtx @ReadyHarris @houmayor My point exactly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tigersruledude @canary_contrary @HoustonHealth @HoustonTX @HoustonOEM @hcphtx @ReadyHarris @houmayor I dislike that “NEW” deaths are reported as such ... NEW to the general public when told is not deaths from April &amp; May... newly-reported started today.  NEW cases reported need more detail ... “ new” can mean a person tested twice and both positive...more info needed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tigersruledude @HoustonHealth @HoustonTX @HoustonOEM @hcphtx @ReadyHarris @houmayor Thank you - I have been asking too... today they changed the wording from “new” deaths to “newly reported” - trying to get data for meaningful interpretation and not for political manipulation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HoustonHealth @HoustonOEM @HoustonTX @hcphtx @ReadyHarris @houmayor I appreciate GREATLY the change in wording! “Newly reported” - REALLY mean it- Thank you!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ABC @TheView Retweet... how about a statement?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jimdunaway How dumb do you REALLY need to be to think that the “noose” was the GARAGE DOOR HANDLE ... OR that dumb to think people would REALLY believe that was your spin when caught??!!  #FakeNoose #nascarhoax #NASCAR #BubbaWallaceHoax<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AP I am pretty sure that people were also KILLED IN CHICAGO ... but just mention those “WOUNDED” .... @AP is becoming irrelevant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AzureSky111 @HoustonHealth Also still waiting for the health department breakdown of those cases originating from protests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mama2lolo @aubrey_huff Private properties CAN require... but should NOT be mandated by local governments.  But then again, I thought REFUSING SERVICE TO ANYONE because of their beliefs was forbidden ...#hypocrisy #COVIDIOT #hypocrites<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aubrey_huff If I test negative for COVID-19, I should not need to wear a mask.... no one will get it from me...and it’s my personal liberty to put myself at risk.  Remember it’s all about “TESTING TESTING TESTING” according to @SpeakerPelosi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TigersJUK So, are you saying the janitor staff and other behind the scenes workers that ALSO GOT RINGS should NOT have received their rings because they do not matter to the team championship?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AzureSky111 @HoustonHealth And misleading the public interpretation of “new” deaths by late reporting leads only to unnecessary fear and panic....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AzureSky111 @HoustonHealth 1700* - keep reading.... that was a two day count.  And people DIE EVERYDAY FROM SOMETHING... are you this concerned about the homicide rate increasing too?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jjank11 @HoustonHealth @houmayor @HoustonTX @HoustonOEM Why would the health department give us THAT DATA? Misleading information leads to FEAR &amp; PANIC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HoustonHealth Nothing “NEW” about deaths from May! Just late reporting...   SO, ONE RECENT death (6/13) and two from first week of June (we are now in 3rd week of June) - misleading public health concerns<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenZeisloft @BonginoReport Wow... segregated zone??!! Offensive<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ErrolWebber The answer to the question for Biden... “Just tell me WHO HAS MORE INTEL ON ME???l” ... thus = 2020 “Nominee”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WolfPackofOn3 @yoalexrapz It’s actually Kyle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yoalexrapz @posonaut Actually, I think it’s Julie Acosta<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill MASKS - the NEW symbol of the Democratic Party 😷 “We can afford the N95 masks but YOU (lowlife non elite) can wear cloth masks” -DO NOTHING to protect you from getting COVID-19; listen to scientists before the media/mob got to them.

<|startoftext|>@TheBadNewsB @Yamiche @Acosta Yamiche is MORE THAN HAPPY to use the toddlers to make her political stab at Trump.... again, PBS has gone so far left it’s sad.  Stopped donating to PBS because of “journalists” acting more like activists<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yamiche @Acosta Thanks for sharing it again!!! If people watch the ENTIRE VIDEO they will understand the message - Media taking things OUT OF CONTEXT is harmful for EVERYONE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grudging1 @Acosta Maybe because that is THE ONLY QUESTION that the reporters ask... oh yeah, and ALL THOSE REPORTERS WILL BE ON THE PLANE TOO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill Yeah... the BETTER segment would have been the part where she shuts Acosta down and he will NOT LET HER TALK! @Acosta should be FIRED for not respecting WOMEN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @Twitter Did you even WATCH the entire video.... MANIPULATED MEDIA is EXACTLY the point Trump was trying to make... just have to be STUPID if the do not see the irony...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bollywoodcowgrl I would have LOVED to homeschool my kids but was not an option.  Live in a rural area and closing schools has been awful for the kids education (did not get taught like other major city kids) because of lack of internet - govt has to fix that -or Elon Musk w/ low cost satellites<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nypost ... way too many “researchers” doing worthless “studies”; MAYBE HEALTHY people are more likely to BEAT CANCER because their body is able to deal with cancer chemo drugs!!!  My experience is a healthy body can handle the chemo BETTER thus a better outcome when treatment ends<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bollywoodcowgrl You are free to Homeschool... cannot run away from this virus - it’s out and not going anywhere- Part of the global world that everyone wants - people travel and will bring it back/forth.  Have to gain immunity over time while protecting vulnerable people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliyyaSwaby @TexasTribune Just given your numbers you provide - then out of the 270 cc centers with COVID cases, that would be 2% of ALL OPEN centers - and as I say many times... make sure these cases are RECENT - “new” deaths reported can be from April &amp; May according to health depts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliyyaSwaby @TexasTribune Where are all these cases? Why is this information not included in this article or published somewhere! I would think that is part of the story? And how many licensed child care facilities are in the state of Texas? Perspective MATTERS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaGray_HouTX ...also mentions that it may be “too early for full confirmation” due to incubation period - but let’s see how Houston does<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheView @ArtAcevedo Is Art Acevedo running for office? He sure enjoys being on VERY LEFT leaning shows - CNN (multiple times) and now the View.  He better be careful because this thing can turn on him as fast as it did on the Atlanta Chief of Police - yikes<|endoftext|>

Simple minds lead to NO REAL CHANGE just WORDS WITHOUT ACTION<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marklevinshow I thought point of a law professor is to teach how to argue a legal position??!! Guess the Prof IS doing his job and the BLSA is just a bunch of failed wannabe lawyers graduating to move to Seattle for jobs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NateSilver538 Have you added in the probability of people that think Biden is just a PUPPET, his lack of engagement with ANY people in last 4 months?! And the HUGE fact that he has NOT named a VP to run with... that will REALLY BE THE (D) NAME ON THE TICKET??!!! Too many unknowns to be valid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NateSilver538 Still take @ScottAdamsSays over what you say<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RashidaTlaib Racist, meaning it knows if you are white, black, Asian, etc??!!! Appears like that may be a important part of the algorithm if trying to locate a criminal...

<|startoftext|>@BeckWJIII @pdub_33 @joe_kodiak @marklevinshow *what is this*? You don’t like assumptions?

<|startoftext|>@BeckWJIII @pdub_33 @joe_kodiak @marklevinshow I would like to think that prison would reform people but I just think it’s like alcohol rehab places - just teaches you new tricks and fucks up your life forever because people think you are a changed person<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@joe_kodiak @marklevinshow Were you aware that Brooks was out on parole for 7yr child abuse conviction? Media/DA forgets to tell that side<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marklevinshow ...also in runoff for election and not doing so hot... has some money misconduct claims and sexual harassment claims too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marklevinshow And again...  failed to mention that RayShard Brooks was out on parole for a 7yr child abuse convoy and had prior DUI  https://t.co/8INGAuBSAb<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HoustonHealth @HoustonTX @houmayor @hcphtx @ReadyHarris 1 NEW DEATH... 2 in this month<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HoustonHealth Delete the word NEW ... one NEW. Two in this month so far!!! Misleading at its BEST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HoustonHealth @HoustonTX @houmayor @hcphtx @ReadyHarris Can there be ANYWAY to get deaths reported in the SAME MONTH of this crisis??!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelBerrySho Has anyone heard mentioned that Brooks was out on parole for a 7yr conviction for chid abuse?!  https://t.co/YqDMWhjso3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Carusofacts @MScottPoet1911 @DLoesch They need to feel “appreciated” for trying...and had older parents that babied them to think that they were all “special and unique” - not told like me to get up and work hard for what you want!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donnabrazile Who would want to take a PPP Loan if their business name and reputation were going to be publicized and scrutinized by THE MEDIA!!! Get over yourself and help AMERICANS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DLoesch I would like to hear from the Black Police Officers Union in Atlanta ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MScottPoet1911 @DLoesch Yeah, pretty sure this is NOT the same - but you get a 🏆 for trying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DLoesch And be out on parole ... but that part has been missed from ANY part of this equation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonathanTurley Has anyone mentioned that Brooks was out on parole?! I would think that would have a MAJOR impact in this case<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@no_silenced ICYMI - he was out on parole - but that MAJOR PART of this story is completely ignored  https://t.co/NpMt3c68BP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@no_silenced Dude is taking a VERY LONG TIME to announce EXACTLY what the charges are....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WTAE What are the charges?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🔥🔥🔥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaeljknowles Exactly the reason they are BANKRUPT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nypost So the $1.1M bill translates to an “insurance discount” of $900k... true paid amount $200k<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coloradoan Systemic Racism HAS to be abolish at ALL levels! But part of the problem is the that gentrification which increases the tax base and drives up values is demonized.

<|startoftext|>@adminnathan @SaraCarterDC That is still totally messed up... watched entire video - did anyone arrest him? If not, that white woman had a target on her once he goes back home - domestic abuse repeats itself over and over - or she is dead already<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NewsPolitics @TimAlberta If the mob cancelled Charlie Rose and Matt Lauer in less than a heartbeat, ANY “JOURNALIST” is at risk of being thrown to the wolves!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hubbard_RMN Wow! Wish WE could ALL do this ... actually TALK instead of using social media for CHANGE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mgpeters23 Good for Mike Gundy.. teaching his player the power of FREE SPEECH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hubbard_RMN Have you not taken any US History classes? It’s called Free Speech! And your opinion in your tweet is allowed ONLY because of it.  You should get some anger management classes soon before it gets out of control<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlbertBreer Guess he is voting for Trump though... tweets before he thinks it ALL the way through?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRickWilson Yeah, no one believes that! But good try ... only Democrats would think “ohhhhhhhh, ok” and agree with you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRickWilson This guy needs TDS medication or a little blue pill... and if you think Trump tweets TOO MUCH - this guy beats Trump’s #’s by a landslide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jasoninthehouse @NintendoAmerica @skipper ...ANOTHER KAREN.... ugh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StxvxBvrtmvn We have just been acting like corrupt and greedy Americans since the 80’s trying to use the Chinese due to their low wages and what we thought was ignorance-all the while they were laughing behind our back while they stole our designs and technology they were sneaky and we lost!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StxvxBvrtmvn Traveled to places in Europe and Middle East and was embarrassed to see Americans acting ignorant to what goes on in the rest of the world - we are ALL privileged as AMERICANS against the backdrop of the rest of the world - and China has been fucking with us for MANY YEARS ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StxvxBvrtmvn I choose to make my OWN CHOICES ...not listen to others make any decisions for me.  Wish I had FU money... but work for myself and have a simple existence.  I treat ALL people with the respect they deserve and am PROUD to be an American...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StxvxBvrtmvn Trump is a DISRUPTOR to the political class... a corrupt, vile group of elites that have never been challenged - exactly why Rep Pres candidates were McCain &amp; Romney (NOT true Rep)! Outsiders NOT WELCOME! They all have “insurance policies” meaning that you do what they say or....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BugInsuranceMan @MissKSizzle @StxvxBvrtmvn @_AXIII_ ... Because Democrats mandated under Clinton and Democratically controlled Congress to have mortgage lenders lower their standards for low income housing - people over bought and took out loans they could not afford with variable interest- not thinking economy may decline!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SomeBitchIKnow Until one of those guys he hands the guns to shoots him in the back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrKarlynB Well written article.  Thank you for your thoughts on this matter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nprpolitics They really had to say “life or death”??!!  Because if Trump wins then the death part of their business is OVER?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StxvxBvrtmvn Then I feel sorry for you - you must be very sheltered and closed minded to want “ANYONE other than Trump” as President.  Democrats lied &amp; cheated since FDR &amp; used their power to keep non-WASP segregated, ignorant, uneducated &amp; dependent- those that chose to not follow PROSPERED<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissKSizzle @StxvxBvrtmvn @_AXIII_ You are bonkers if you are saying the only business left for non-whites is ILLEGAL businesses??!! This is 2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StxvxBvrtmvn Guess you missed the question I asked or have no opinion who is President- “just NOT Trump” ... which is an uneducated answer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNNnewsroom @hcphtx ... or your “pre-interview” made sure to tell the Dr - “DO NOT MENTION PROTESTORS or you, Sylvester Turner and Chief Art Acevedo will NEVER BE ALLOWED to further your political career on CNN again!” Joke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNNnewsroom @hcphtx Yet NOT ONE MENTION OF 60k protesters marching together in Houston!!!! Hahahahaha hahahahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewCraft @jonathanvswan @JoeBiden What a waste of money... that amount could defund the police and fund the BLM FOR YEARS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JesseKellyDC Since NOT ONE COUNTRY will let you know who OWNS their debt.. it’s all a big ruse! US pays China, China pays us, US borrows from Germany to give to Brazil, Brazil loans to Columbia, Columbia loans to Ecuador, Russia loans to China, China loans to Iran... shell game!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissKSizzle @StxvxBvrtmvn @_AXIII_ So what kind of privilege is it for a person that makes something of themselves with no loans, no family assistance, no college degree and LOTS of hard work and no sleep? Only academics doing “research papers” from their ivory towers can answer that question Signed, Lowlife here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MBonilla1 @ushahmd @ASALifeline Yet NEVER mentioned the 60k gathered for PROTESTS?!! Mentioned graduation, Mother’s Day, Fathers Day &amp; 4th of July??!! Hmmm... slanted dialogue much?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@marklevinshow @ABC @GStephanopoulos &amp; all MSM has blood on their hands ... time to tone down the “bad cop” narrative - throwing political fuel on a false narrative does not further discussion or save any lives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marceelias Tell George Soros you are giving his money back...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StxvxBvrtmvn So who would you have as your President? Kamala? She arrested and put in jail many black people and married to white man -remove the scabs from your eyes and see that racism is in the Democratic Party - those same white people that created systems to keep black people suppressed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@resigncongress @TinaMGLong @JoyAnnReid That is NOT WHAT HAPPENED<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TinaMGLong @JoyAnnReid Please be informed before you tweet and promote drunk driving<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TexasTribune Will make that judgement in a month... MSM always moves on.... if people really care, they will make Chicago murders a thing to talk about instead of just bad white cop killing a black person... black on black killing much more destructive to any chance of cultural change<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>... what did @JoeBiden just say?! A drug user’s murder HAD more impact than MLK’s murder??!!   Let’s check back on that statement in one week, one month... “Floyd who?” by the MSM... sad but true!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TexasTribune @statesman So you are telling me it’s now OK to not pull over when a police officer turns on his lights and is trying to give me a ticket at 1:23 am - which is a prime time for drunk drivers?!

<|startoftext|>@NaomiFromATIM @fw_mason @InayaFolarin Chicago murders are not BLM? The St Louis policeman Dorn is not BLM? Aborted babies are not BLM?

<|startoftext|>@MiamiHerald How does he have a job/employer that he travels to CHINA for but has a “junk plan”?! If self employed, then he should not have bought a catastrophic plan if he has NO SAVINGS - very common for young men who think they will never “need it”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great writers ... as long as they hate Trump, have major TDS and are ready to exit stage left and retire... Comey, where have you been on MSDNC?  https://t.co/GwzJGxWvYx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Javelin Literary Agents sure have a bunch of high profile people telling lies in their books (Bolton, Comey, now Yovanivich) yet they are such “private” people 🤮🤮  https://t.co/AVAaYOGpL4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RubinReport Bernie never answered ONE QUESTION- he is a FRAUD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BernieSanders Or they can ask if there are any foundations that assist for people without healthcare ...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NateSilver538 Warren looking desperate... throwing bombs at everyone and anything to stay “relevant”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Toran_9 @AOC I will make it simple for you... Democratic Socialism means two classes of people - ruling class and slum class - and I want neither!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Toran_9 @AOC You start first and let me know how it works for you in your immediate family...I will wait while @AOC pays her taxes and gives away her salary to make sure everyone in her family all has the exact same.  Let me know who gets pissed off first<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chelseahandler Hello “white Hollywood” Privileged strikes again....guess no apologies for this tweet yet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realannapaulina @SebGorka The debt charade is part of the “global” entanglement to keep every large developed country to “borrow” from each other so that not any one of them can fail.  Why is it that not ONE MAJOR COUNTRY will tell you WHO OWNS THEIR DEBT?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😳😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorOfLA LOL... think your subtitles should be in Spanish, not English?! Democratic White men “thinking” hard in this one.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkyeCity_ @BernieSanders Just keep thinking about how Bernie’s THREE HOUSES fit into his narrative<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarackObama Thank you @BarackObama for reminding me today that spending $840 BILLION dollars with the stroke of the pen is the exact reason why I have no problem spending $5 billion dollars to protect THOSE JOBS from illegal immigrants trying to take them away from those most vulnerable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BostonCathSupt @CSOboston With disciplined and faithful Catholic leadership in the schools focused on the children’s faith foundation &amp; excellent academic standards, all our children have exceeded our expectations as children of God living in the secular world.

<|startoftext|>@BetteMidler Sorry but all I heard was “FOUR MORE YEARS!!!” ... maybe put your hearing aid in next time and glasses on - it’s @DAYTONA500 crazy lady<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KellyO getting shut down is a great pastime... esp after watching @realDonaldTrump and @FLOTUS drive the Beast at @DISupdates 😍😍🔥<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@briantylercohen @realDonaldTrump Sorry, but I missed when Bill Clinton speaks for his $$$$ the introduction of “Impeached” Pres. Bill Clinton... means NOTHING<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JudicialWatch All I ever see is complaints filed on these people BUT NO FINDINGS or results - getting very frustrating to watch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealKyleMorris @drawandstrike Probably 60% of men have already had a vasectomy by 50 anyway!! Rolanda Harris is dumb<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@conservmillen @FullFrontalSamB There is no audience!! Because no one cares or watches her show<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dumpste63124759 @MaddowBlog Maybe you have read the latest news about the tainted jury pool. Will all come out when Barr appears on Capitol Hill - hopefully with ABJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends @FoxNews ...and a miracle, ALL TWEETS of @hartformemphis after 11/15/2019 are DELETED! (Day Roger Stone convicted) Hillary taught her minions WELL!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shem_Infinite @seanmdav @Ryan_Milliron @FuarFearg So I guess the House Judiciary Comm will be meeting with Barr in March behind closed doors?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizRNC @seanmdav Why does THE MSM give up ALL the Dirty DNC tricks? Everything that they blame Trump for is WHAT THEY ARE/HAVE done🙄🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/CD2HH2YMwg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dailymemphian Hmmmmm.... Could THIS reason be WHY the 4 prosecutors DEPARTED so quickly?! They all knew THIS story was going to break and bailed SHIP!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@girlsreallyrule No one here SEES anything WRONG with a jury foreman that has a bias towards the accused?! God forbid ANY of you are in a revered situation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRealMarkCM Exactly how can Warren make the “promise” to create an independent commission? She has NO ability to do that in her role as Senator and there is 0.01% chance that she will be the Democrats nominee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oops! Should NOT be in  District Court if he cannot win honestly - no integrity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hahahaha... True Trump Gangsta answer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Somthin2belivin @ScottAdamsSays Thank you for that INFORMATION!! She needs to tell that to reporters NOW that they are giving her some airtime.  I think she is the best choice in the field... I am always open to good moderate candidates - just not ever jumping on the Swamp or Bernie campaign! She could do it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@girlsreallyrule How do you get this information?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods trying to figure out why you have a bunch of dogs pics popping up in your feed... so here it goes, I present Chip!  https://t.co/S5ABITtPIe<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MaddowBlog Agree!! A political infestation of leftist, radical, activist prosecutors that should have been out 3 years ago! Finally cleaning out the SWAMP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ewarren @AshleyJudd Well that was a waste of time and money<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NateSilver538 She just said there is room for pro-lifers in the Democratic Party... sounds good but we all know better!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dumpste63124759 @BlueRobotDesign @realDonaldTrump This is winning...  https://t.co/vXOy4T9Hru<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Straight up BS... OR just a very sad statement. Just shows you that Hollywood cares more about politics than telling your kids that you love them on your death bed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlueRobotDesign @realDonaldTrump Winning never gets old!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrbromwich Key word in your bio is FORMER DOJ IG. “Has been” is all I see tweeting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN when it’s NOT EVEN TRENDING and all @ChrisCuomo  is talking about (with Andrew McCabe😂😂😂🥱🥱) is Trump and the Justice Dept prosecutors departing is LAUGHABLE! This is FAKE NEWS - they were 4 leftist activist prosecutors that should not be in a courtroom!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 Bernie CHANGED his “message” tonight ... in Bernie speech starting talking like a moderate... using words like “Immigration Reform” rather than Open Borders and “Gun Safety Reform” ... not taking away the 2nd Amendment?!! Beware... Bernie knows he needs the DNC to win<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi Too bad you let a MAN speak for you!  Hmmmm thinking about the visual of that... but go ahead and look pretty on that stage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottAdamsSays And the GREEN?! How is that patriotic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meaganmday @AOC Where exactly is the love? All I hear is hatred of TRUMP... nothing positive ever said about the USA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love this 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>His father studied Marxism... and Pete is a total fake!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg! This is ME when I get older! 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Janefonda You really are gullible.  Exactly where is that “harvested from” so ethically?! Would love to do a little research to see...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ATLFireRescue @atlfire.  did you really suspend Capt. Daniel Dwyer? What kind of message does this send? Pathetic and sad that your city values anything OVER SAVING A PERSONS LIFE! He wanted to save that poor woman and your RULES say otherwise.  @foxnews @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PFFW Terrible action to suspend him! What kind of message does this send? To put insurance rates above someone’s life when considering a rescue attempt??!! Pathetic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeamTrump @MSNBC Her producer will be fired! Hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 Nope... not sick of WINNING yet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JRubinBlogger Will you guys EVER learn?!! Has NOT WORKED the last few times... but go ahead - would LOVE to see Barr tell us all on CNN’s coverage about the leftist activist prosecutors that were trying the case!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greggutfeld It’s that new hairdo of @greggutfeld that @brianstelter is REALLY jealous of...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeslieProll @nytimes Bring it on... another beat down by Barr on Nadler would be a welcome sight to see... did not work out so well for Mueller or the Impeachment charade did it. Get the House BACK TO WORK on drug prices and fixing roads &amp; bridges!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nytimes Rouge activist leftist prosecutors have NO place in our courts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like we really needed ANOTHER reason to vote the Democrats OUT IN NOVEMBER #TurnHouseRedAgain2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oops... Bloomberg has some explaining to do!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NatGeo Yet this is 2020 and science has substantially changed since October 1918.  A vaccine for this 2020 virus is in development as we speak and will be in the testing pool within months... good story, but kind of clickbait and fear-mongering<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuddLegum Newsflash Boomer wannabe @JuddLegum - there is this thing called a DVR that automatically records these shows so that I watch them first thing Sunday morning while all the lib MSM SHOWS are on... but good try!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wow! Shocked... not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmericaFirstPAC Well now we know that Pete Buttigeg would be denouncing his own late Father - a professor who also studied neo-Marxism and wanted Marxism in the wider culture... @realDonaldTrump will make sure everyone knows that small fact! #TrojanHorse much?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😁👇<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JamielFCotman @caroljsroth So I guess you don’t have a story to tel and you have not pulled yourself up... time to exit stage now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@newtgingrich The goal of Democratic Socialism is to have all its citizens think they are scum and have no ability to be better than they currently are so that the govt can teach them the way! NO thanks Bernie!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Susan_Hennessey I think @Susan_Hennessey is eating her stale words about now after these replies.. you are just as fake as your own words.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonathanTurley I have said this yesterday... but Vindman testifies under oath that he talked about this phone call to two people.. his brother and the whistleblower- which was against the law. He should be happy that all they get is a transfer.  And Sondland is an wealthy idiot needing to go!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@washingtonpost Why has no one mentioned that Vindman said under oath that he told TWO PEOPLE about this phone call... his brother and the whistleblower - which is illegal to share classified information!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonathanTurley Keyword is “himself” rather than as a Senator representing the people of Utah.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Obamacare Is there REALLY an official twitter account for “Obamacare”?!! That’s a joke at itself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nypost WHY is Joe Biden STILL in the center after Bernie &amp; Pete won Iowa? He should be on the ends like the other losers in the field<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@madeline_meyers ...this is for YOU 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi ... so instead she deflects to “what happened to the 49’ers”!! Seems like everything around you is losing.  Exit stage left now for the winners<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi I feel like I am watching a very old beauty pageant and Nancy is trying to answer the “question phase”... don’t forget after your babbling to say “World Peace”!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Omg... LOVE that this will trigger SO many TDS people on Twitter #KAG2020LandslideVictory<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WesleyHuntTX @tedcruz You have my vote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC Of course you will... hopefully your squad will be with you so that we do not have to see you on the TV #demsout<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CBSThisMorning @tonydokoupil @RobbyMook Wait... wasn’t Robby Mook trending on Twitter last night for being involved in the whole app mess? Why is he on CBS This Morning talking like he has no involvement? That’s NEWS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PubOperator Worst coin toss EVER... did he not know how to flip a coin?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisMurphyCT Said no 11 year old EVER - “Renovations”??!! But good try... and maybe get your kid an Xbox or bicycle so they can be a kid for a few more years<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mbromsmith Thank goodness for social media to see the ACTUAL results from Iowa - hopefully DNC will not report 45% of delegates awarded to @JoeBiden - because its a Bernie, Pete &amp; Warren show for the future<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RebootDad @bhalle87 @PeteButtigieg @JoeBiden You are wrong...time to get back to your basement<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden must need to get to bed... cannot wait for Iowa DNC to rig the delegate count.  He knows he is done.  And thanked Delaware people for being there before he remembered he was in Iowa.  And new nickname.. “Former President Trump” - time for bed Joe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bhalle87 @PeteButtigieg And @JoeBiden NOT in TOP 15% - thinking this may be a reason for the “delay”...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Never enough...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandPaul So I guess this just PROVES that Eric Ciaramella IS THE WHISTLEBLOWER... if Justice Roberts implied he would not “name” the whistleblower, but the question did not say ANYTHING about “whistleblower” 👌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂😂😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DLiedman @SenWarren The force is strong with this one...🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HillaryClinton @SecretsBedard Guess the CNN Bernie/Warren hoax fight did not work against Bernie, so the DNC falls back to their ever reliable troll Hillary Clinton to get Bernie off the main stage... @DNC I think everyone sees your cards for Biden - give it up<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump From my Representative most of those “bills” are for laws already on the books just in another form requiring MORE MONEY! Said the REAL SUBSTANCE of issues will not be brought up for debate and “stuck” in committee because of impeachment taking all those people’s time up<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ezrock5 @AshAgony Common sense has been thrown out the window! Yes the cop was a little aggressive with his POWER. Happy this was NOT ME... I would not have been as nice as this guy getting detained. #lawsuit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewYorkStateAG Be careful what you wish for... it is also illegal to share individual income tax information. You can have it, but cannot share to media.  I would not want to go to jail just to help take down a political opponent!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 Schiff can testify FOR the Whistleblower!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not shocked!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow!!!! The Democratic “CANCEL CULTURE” has a NEW threat!!! Shocking what they will drag up when Jim Jordan gets a SEAT ON THE Impeachment Inquiry PUBLIC council<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thus CONFIRMING that there was NEVER a REAL whistleblower -the “whistleblower” was THE ATTORNEY and used Schiff to hide behind! Story getting good!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnnbrk Good - it should be slashed and deflated! The South is respectful and never wants to look like London, West Coast or East Coast loonies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just gotta LOVE THIS!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aldotcom To all you dissenters out there... the South shows RESPECT, so keep all your liberal BS up North &amp; West since you have probably never been to AL or LA!

<|startoftext|>@GaryGrumbach @BernieSanders Yet Bernie is not a “front runner”? Sounds like DNC party is not in control of their party... guess we have to wait for Iowa election results to see if they are manipulating the actual vote... no way Biden or Warren will win<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisMurphyCT Are you talking about Obama and FISA warrants?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great teams in the World Series! Plus, they have to be together next training season!! 😁<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Yes I will be voting for Donald Trump to make sure PEOPLE LIKE YOU ARE NEVER ELECTED ... tired of Washington insiders getting RICH while I keep paying more taxes with NO BENEFITS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HoustonChron I am waiting for A PICTURE of the border wall with the hole as described!! TERRIBLE story!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dscc Hell yes! Even MORE because of the UNFAIR impeachment inquiry over a NON ISSUE telephone conversation.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec Yet Obama has been last seen WHERE?! Oh yeah, hiding from the IG report.... Guess he better move to New Zealand with Comey!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StopBigMoney I liked him up until the moment he cashed in his chips for $$$millions in book deals and California paybacks for favors from Netflix and Co - the $15m mansion on the coast was the kicker - all faux climate change supporter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nypost Obviously the “PARENTS” are not trying that hard to find their kids either! If my baby was taken, I would be kicking &amp; screaming and talking to every media outlet... maybe suggests that they did NOT really come with their parents and were not separated, but dropped off!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeamPelosi I care more about border security, national debt, USMCA, and making sure our bridges do not crumble because the House does not pass any meaningful legislation! Waste of MY taxpayer dollars<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ewarren Kavanaugh IS NOT what people care about... but then again, I guess you enjoy living in the FAKE PAST!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RubinReport This is why you do not elect people who are simply trying so hard to put on a SHOW... “eye glass fix” by AOC makes her look so much smarter!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree with Senator @tedcruz -- the U.S. Senate should take up the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act and pass it into law! Let's have a vote, @senatemajldr! #StandWithHK #StandWithHongKong #StandForFreedom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Completely agree!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden NO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesMartinSJ You sounds like you are having a Father Corapi moment...take some time and go to the Vatican for help<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mjhegar Border wall and legal immigration, defending life from conception to natural death, and protecting the 1st &amp; 2nd Amendments<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NateSilver538 Or maybe Republicans just don’t vote in West/East coast areas because they know that their vote means nothing in Blue areas.  Maybe if we did not have EC all people would VOTE because they would understand that their one vote matters no matter where you live.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just cannot make this crap up... an anonymous writer of a book now??!! And exactly WHY we anyone want to pay for that... should be FREE!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow... CNN keeps trying SO HARD to keep Biden in the race! There is NO WAY the Democratic majority of voters want the frail Biden as the nominee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidfolkenflik This is a non-story to distract from the great Astros organization... move on and go back to focusing on the NBA and NFL DV issues ... or Chinese human rights violations and the NBA support of those offenses<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bopinion Terribly written piecemeal of an article. But TDS is real and the people of Wisconsin are seeing the Democrats true colors .... pretty much everything they are against - guns, freedom and hard work<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BreakandEnterTV @NatashaBertrand @JohnBrennan Yet the picture you choose shows Mueller laughing at him.... ??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Guess Michael Bloomberg is deciding to run as the Democratic candidate...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That is SO CLASSIC!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@newtgingrich It will be fun watching China get involved in all the endless wars... now the world can drain their bank accounts too<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Love...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@msnbc... i guess you have been told to take ⁦@TulsiGabbard⁩ out of the race... although she raised MORE money than Booker and all on the bottom rung. #Democrats you better watch how your party is screwing this up!  https://t.co/JwvGkNEGWj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will never forget... being in the stands and hearing the cheers was AMAZING!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@houstonpolice @astros Well it would have been nice if traffic had ANY some of control after the win! Awful job tonight on your part<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@houstonpolice is there a reason that traffic cannot be controlled in any kind of rational way after the Astros win??!! Terrible job tonight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ewarren That is $1,000,000 a year for people who have $50,000,000 - and most of those people have wealth in land and businesses - NOT CASH.  Plus it will NEVER PASS the Senate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dbongino Just wait until they taste it... they will get hooked just like all of us in the US and the lessor will REGRET this decision in a year when a new lease is signed and has a LINE around the building<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...because you will never see REAL news on the MSM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TulsiGabbard ...and from all the trolls responding to you, YOU MUST HAVE HIT A NERVE! Haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TulsiGabbard Love your honesty!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBCDFW Those left wing antifa did not show up in Dallas like they did in Minnesota... the “deplorable“ south is much more in control BECAUSE they cling to their guns &amp; their God &amp; such.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WasteManagement your employee Billy Shelby just made my heart sing. A great employee doing a wonderful small deed for one of your customers.  An example to many of helping out your fellow American in need.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JobiOfc @parscale @LaraLeaTrump ... Billy Shelby ..this is what MAGA AND KAG is all about! Helping your neighbors when in need.  Great American example for many<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Letting the LIGHT shine on all the misdeeds of the political class and bad foreign actors! Thank you @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeamPelosi ....and this will be the LEGACY you leave with - endless investigations and NO LEGISLATION with your name on it<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pam2734 @DocFossick @JoeBiden I wish that would work - but rest of world taxes business income at 20% ... the main reason the new tax law was reduced to 21%.  Big companies just move their headquarters to the lowest country taxing authority and leave their money overseas. Taxes will always be avoided<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AOC ...@realDonaldTrump America is FINALLY being exposed to ALL the creatures of the SWAMP! Thank you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC Well your FIRST MISTAKE is quoting Brian Stelter who is quoting ANYONE from the NYT!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden ...and your basis of comparison? You, Pelosi, Schiff?!! Just waiting to find out about Schumer’s kid on some Ukraine board next....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Healthcare is a finite resource... you either limit it by price increases or limit it by reduction in service.... rich people will just pay for private health care and the poor will be stuck with the crappy system.  Look AROUND THE WORLD!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pam2734 @DocFossick @JoeBiden ...someone has to pay - it’s either you OR you though taxes by your state or federal government<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden ....and Obamacare increased the healthcare premium expenses of 300,000,000+ hard working Americans with insurance so that those 20,000,000 that probably can no longer afford the Obamacare initial premiums still suffer ... complete failure to limit premium increases by insurance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dscc Nate Silver and FiveThirtyEight also gave Trump a 97% chance of losing!!! Go back to your books and the year 1999<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nytimes Gotta LOVE the push for Warren by the media!! But poor ‘ol Bernie - getting booted to the curb AGAIN in favor of a WHITE WOMAN by the DNC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ProtectTerrencekWilliams @Twitter Seriously.... I think you are showing some SERIOUS BIAS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MittRomney ... and NOW we see why the DNC wanted you to run against Obama.  You &amp; Ryan were on the same side... the DIRT ON YOU TWO MUST RUN DEEP!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MittRomney According to fundraising money raised and people in attendance at Biden rallies, BIDEN IS NOT THE FRONTRUNNER by a LONG SHOT!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Looks like an American flag from far away #BuildTheWall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamalaHarris You probably should suspend your shot of the highest office in the land... because your chance of winning is 0.01% ... I mean you still have some chance - and ACT BLUE PAC has got to be ready to give funds to the real contenders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AP @emarvelous OMG  (again) - You guys have a “national race writer”??!! Like that persons ONE JOB is to find stories solely about RACE and use it to write “stories” about ALL THE evil people in the world?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonSouse @PJGJ03 @nytimes @paulkrugman ...this coming from a person (@RonSouse) that just joined the Twitter world 6 months ago! No thanks, I get my ideas from people that have been in the digital world a little longer than that...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nytimes @paulkrugman Seriously, you guys are TRYING THAT strategy AGAIN??!!! Seriously, you guys need to get out of your offices and out into REAL AMERICA! We are all doing JUST FINE!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ewarren Guess you are waiting until FRIDAY NIGHT to release your Q3 fundraising numbers!!! Must be trying to “find” all those small donations and wonder why they are not adding up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN Give it 24 hours and the story will have completely changed!!! A story ... not THE STORY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>His fundraising numbers in 3rd place ... actually 4th or 5th If Warren or Beto ever release their numbers!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @dbongino @JoeBiden .... So, I guess the DNC finally HAD to release that Biden is NOT the front runner OR Trump’s political opponent! Sure looks like @BernieSanders is getting the shaft by the DNC AGAIN!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepAdamSchiff Deflection at its finest ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HATE NATION ... the DEVIL is in the details<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@w_terrence ... good idea - your flight might have been delayed by a TDS meltdown after the person has a reality check!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump while your GREAT HEALTHCARE FOR ALL speech is airing on Fox, MSDNC AND Clinton News Network are talking about you ... and not one mention of any Dem for 2020! TDS Stage 4; CNN breaking news “Pence Repeats Trumps Debunked Biden Conspiracies”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fiorella_im @SenSanders Guess the DNC is at it again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ewarren Lets worry about where your fundraising numbers are for 3rd Qtr 2019... not released yet? Looks bad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ewarren why have you NOT released your 3rd Qtr 2019 fundraising? Hiding something or trying to figure out how to spin it? Lets go...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I love that TDS is making Dems rational now! Trying SO HARD to explain that this picture is just of Biden’s and business partner. NOTHING to do with Ukraine... Dems you are all so woke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GlennKesslerWP Must be nice to be in the RICH Swamp Inheritance chain... model, partners, board members... but none of them used their NAMES to get any of those gigs... all by their own sweat! Speak freely on a golf course when no one is recording what you talk about!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@repcleaver Called Barr doing his JOB! You set yourself up for this one... Learn - bad idea to tweet something you do not want to hear truth in response to... or get more experienced interns to tweet for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nytimes I see TDS in full effect - 4th stage - the end for those that have it and refuse treatment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MariannaNBCNews Question to Biden: What exactly do you mean by “legitimate”??!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MariannaNBCNews Exhibit A is Biden being called out as a swamp creature... and thinking that the political realm would never bite him back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oops - misspoke earlier - maybe 200 people - of which 175 are reporters desperate to ask about “Where is Hunter?”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReutersTV I am sorry - I missed seeing that Biden campaign stop on TV... must have been a sleeper with another 35 people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the hell is 45%-38% in headlines  mean... looks like CLICK BAIT to get views!!! I did not bite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeadlineWH @JohnBrennan @NicolleDWallace “Political fortunes dwindling”??!! Last time I checked he just raised $125million in the 3rd Qtr 2019.  That is after $105million in the 2nd Qtr.  I think we will be seeing ALOT of Trump in the future... yard signs will be FREE this year!! Made from oil based straws<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeadlineWH @JohnBrennan @NicolleDWallace ...and the discredit campaign BEGINS before the IG report comes to light... And then all confirmed by John Durham... who is scared now?!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@davidcicilline It’s called an investigation... like the one that Obama FBI &amp; CIA should have done before spying on Trump campaign and starting Russian collusion rumors<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepKinzinger @realDonaldTrump “Beyond repugnant”??!! Must have been in the $$$-for-DNC money memo ... NO ONE TALKS LIKE THAT!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMaxineWaters I thought you were voted out of office... replaced by The Squad!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@washingtonpost Last time I checked the US was not having an Ebola epidemic...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dscc Are you REALLY showing an old pic of Obama??!! Can you NOT find ONE Democratic Senator to be the face of your Senate campaign??!! Oh my...you guys are in deep trouble!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@escapedmatrix @KarenPence Oh it’s been handled! All fabricated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RashidaTlaib ... have you been in touch now that she has said it was all fabricated??!! When you stop promoting division, this nonsense will stop<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I will just wait for Election Day to see the REAL POLLS - rather than media polls<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump After “favor” was talk about CROWDSTRIKE... read the damn transcript<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Ask Schiff why his staffer was sent AFTER he received the whistleblower complaint<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marklevinshow This is the exact reason why Trump will never turn over his tax returns... the investigations will just never stop<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matflamm @nytimes Those deplorables at least recognize that SOULS exist... liberals worship the God of Globalization<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nytimes We are all DEPLORABLES!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBSNews Norah - trying to figure out WHO side you are on... STAY OFF TWITTER if you  would like to be on the air ... MEDIA NEEDS TO BE IMPARTIAL!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marklevinshow We ALL know it’s really a woman... purposely say “he” as a way to cover it all up.... just waiting! That whistleblower wants the NEXT BOOK DEAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC ...these are the SAME pollsters that said Hillary would win!!! Hahahhaha hahahahaha hahahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC Who has EVER been selected for these polls? I do not answer random calls and walk past any person with a clipboard... and do not have a home phone anymore. Soooooooo, who/where are you finding people to poll?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dbongino @realDonaldTrump Did Adam Schiff REALLY travel to Ukraine in the last 30 days?!! Now that is something to be asking about... any QUID PRO QUO during that trip??!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abyssiniancat81 @BreakingNLive Just this PAST AUGUST???!!! Like AFTER THE Trump call??!! What?! Why?! ....so strange!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nedryun Completely agree!! Transparency is in full effect with how the cover has been blown on the Intel swamp rats - time for the good intel guys to use the same tactics to blow those bad rats out into sunlight ☀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FaceTheNation @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @margbrennan Love how Margaret Brennan says “hmmhum”.... like “there is not a chance in hell I am even going to listen to a word you say because I am just a DNC media plant”!!!! Maybe in the future FTN should cut the part of her looking like she is rolling her eyes at Graham<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nytimes ...wait, meaning the way it’s been done under Clinton, Bush &amp; Obama White House’s??!! Guess rules have been changed starting in 2016... I am ALL FOR TRANSPARENCY - swamp will get drained MUCH FASTER!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Carson King just got me to donate money to his cause -loved the story before, now love it even more!

<|startoftext|>@theshulesfan But i also do not want my next President based only on sexual orientation... i could care less what anyone does in their private life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theshulesfan We just said the same thing... hitting all the issues well - but if he had a blonde stay at home wife, he would be the nomination! ...and this from someone who voted for Trump only because i did not trust Hilary<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Shepard Smith @ShepNewsTeam PLEASE take your show on the road &amp; go walk a mile (or a few thousand) with the illegal immigrants/mostly 18-25 men (only filming women &amp; kids in camps) and are definitely ON THEIR WAY!

<|startoftext|>@TheAtlantic @CaitlinPacific Classy article - thank you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very happy to hear!!!  Thank you to all those that served to protect political freedom in the US.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cracy_o @Yamiche @HardballChris I am pretty sure much has changed on that road since 30 years ago!!!  I live in Texas and understand the dangers of crossing at non-border crossing and the cost paid to each regional cartel. I also witness every day illegal standing on a corner waiting for day labor work<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @MichaelBerrySho Could ICE and Tx Border Patrol start a signup sheet for Americans to register to support the Illegal Immigrant Caravan into their homes and fully support their stay!  Maybe Pelosi, Schumer, Warren, Booker, Harris &amp; BETO will be first to register!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@politico Can these migrants just stay with the sympathetic Mexicans then?  Or maybe we can start a list of Americans that would welcome these migrants into their homes and fully support their stay!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Defeat_Trump2 How are these shelters being organized in Mexico?  Or is that too intelligent to ask?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IngrahamAngle That is a VERY weird picture?  What is holding them back?  Why are they all in a line begging for water?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenTedCruz @JohnCornyn - I agree!  This madness has to stop before it gets to OUR TEXAS borders.  Leave Texas alone!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanCrenshawTX @DanaPerino Probably because they have NONE to debate!  Sad but true.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StevenABC13 Who comes up with these chants? ugh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews @jorgeramosnews And has NO ONE watched this happen to Europe and what happened at the grassroots level when they allowed it?!  Why is Merkel in Germany worried about being removed as PM if its all good?! Time to be honest about this invasion.  Next they want us to change the name of the country!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews @jorgeramosnews "The vast majority of these people are not illegals...they are mostly MEN"... oh wait, there was ONE WOMAN WITHOUT A BABY OR PREGNANT...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hchyyz @TAugustGreen1 @bryandenney @MichaelAvenatti So WHY is it important then?  Just so that he can have idiots talk about it? How about we have Immigration laws to worry about instead of Trump's tax returns that have no purpose for Americans and their lives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GerryDawes Thus even more reason to stop this madness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cracy_o @Yamiche @HardballChris I think that is the point everyone is trying to make - there is no way they are going to be walking the whole way... they will be driven somehow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RNBOClothing way to plagerize @JimAcosta<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cathysomps @FoxNews @jorgeramosnews @DHSgov @POTUS I was thinking the SAME thing!  Where are ALL the women and children in strollers... almost looked a little staged... Are there vans and trucks carrying everyone else?  And who is determining the "Cities" that are the staging locations to reach each day?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Newsweek Glad they can leave all their trash on the ground too!  Don't MESS with Texas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Newsweek GREAT!! Just who I want to come into MY COUNTRY!  They can stay there if they don't respect our laws and the President of the US.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hchyyz @TAugustGreen1 @bryandenney @MichaelAvenatti and you would understand how to read them if you did??  I know he is RICH and that his tax returns would not tell you WHO he owes money to OR WHO he does business with... A US Tax Return only says how much money you MADE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YesSheDidHoney @thehill So I triggered you did I?  My private school education has no idea what you just said... can you translate that for me?  #OHNOYOUDIDNT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@karlazabs I don't see those countries sending thousands of people to our borders trying to invade our nation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great job!  Keep it up!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well maybe that explains the "scheduling conflict" with Avenatti having to cancel the Anti-Trump rally in Houston tonight - he had to go look for new office space!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@be69co @JackieGailConr1 @trupatriot20 @BetoORourke @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @tedcruz Its the biggest stadium that Secret Service will allow - Trying not to trigger you<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@be69co @JackieGailConr1 @trupatriot20 @BetoORourke @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @tedcruz 100k people asked for tickets... 18k will be inside and any left will watch from big screens outside stadium<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sweetcorrieb @mannyNYT Alex - I am sorry you need to check your information sources for fake news.... was NEVER at NRG Stadium....but Arena!  Then moved to Toyota - which holds 18K<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Luzita0 Thats ALL the people that showed up for his stop in Pasadena?  Too bad it was not "permitted" to show the crowd size...or lack thereof!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackieGailConr1 @trupatriot20 @BetoORourke @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @tedcruz 100k people REQUESTED tickets - not all there!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ryan84125975 Wish you would have taken pics from the OTHER side of the DG... You know the side where the line went with all the people sitting next to the restaurant under the big oak trees....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ryan84125975 @PeteHegseth @foxandfriends I can send you pics from the ground if you still think its FAKE NEWS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ryan84125975 @PeteHegseth @foxandfriends Funny - because IF YOU WERE ACTUALLY there you would be able to know that the line actually TURNS there and starts going BACK from the Toyota Center - which is CONVENIENTLY NOT IN YOUR pic !!!  Keep searching for more pictures you took HAHAHAHA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TAugustGreen1 @bryandenney @MichaelAvenatti Where are his tax returns??  I just see that he owes the American taxpayers $$$$$$$$$$$$$$ but not how much he earned<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnJef14398510 Well at least you know your "trigger"!  That was the key word that was sent out to Dems on today's "What is our Word of the Day?" robocall!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimInHonolulu @realDonaldTrump You are trying REALLY hard to tell yourself that Trump is not working for the American people... This is CALLED propaganda that you are spreading<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ryan84125975 @PeteHegseth @foxandfriends good try @Ryan84125975!  I can see on news that there are &gt;25k in downtown Houston waiting in line... at 9:30AM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@karlazabs Is this at the same location that was handing out the peso bills to the crowd?  Get at one location to give back at another?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katelinthicum @PmcdonnellLAT So the violence has begun.... God bless this soul, but this is a trek that will ONLY lead to more DEATH and VIOLENCE.  More danger of the Mexican drug cartels that control the US/Mexico border will run over any person that does not PAY their fee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@karlazabs There are people LOOKING for legitimate reporting on this subject... You sending out tweets like this are not helpful.  There are 7k+ people and you cannot possibly think that a Gu Police person you called would KNOW this answer/ How about you ASK the Mexican Police on the ground<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Teddy_Stache @koalateatimes @karlazabs ICYMI - this is 2018 and these are not PILGRIMS - please send your address to the border so that if you support this, then they can come live with you under YOUR support.  I want them to go through LEGAL immigration system<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HuffPostPol NOT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS??!!!  Keep reporting this over and over so that it REALLY ticks off LEGAL AMERICANS... Otherwise, if YOU support this, PLEASE forward your address to the Border so that the "non-illegal migrants" can come live in your house under YOUR SUPPORT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChauncyOnTV Most will probably come pick up their chairs on the way out.  Otherwise, hopefully the homeless community will come take them instead of throwing them in the trash!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChauncyOnTV Smart man!  That is how AMERICA WORKS!  Hard work, supply what is demanded for a buck and support your own way :))<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods SO AUSTIN!!!!  Wonder where they found that set?!!  Maybe Los Angeles!!! hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmshowalter1 Happens all the time... many migrants pay drug cartels to get them thru the border crossings in trucks - most of these people have no idea that there are 1000's that die in the trucks every year.  They need to cross over as LEGAL immigrants and stay with family<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Democrats ALWAYS have an excuse that NEVER works out!  #VOTERED<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReaganBattalion @JohnJamesMI I really LOVE @JohnJamesMI.... every time I see him interacting with the people!  Praying for you to win!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HuffPost Did he really say that (paraphrasing) Kayne should stick with music and Hot Dog eating champ should stick w hot dogs and when it comes to politics, he does not want to hear them talk??!!

<|startoftext|>#KavanaughHearings @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins @JeffFlake I hope you know how much me and my friends will be taking our sons over 18 to the voting booths WITH US! Kavanaugh was a great man standing up for himself, his integrity and is credible and should be voted ONTO the SC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelBerrySho AMEN - I am going to take my 18 year old son with me to vote (straight Republican for the first time EVER)!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SebGorka @SenFeinstein @SenatorDurbin @maziehirono @SenBlumenthal @SenWhitehouse @CoryBooker @KamalaHarris Independents have a whole NEW level of understanding in making their voting decisions in November and how important it will be to vote for Republicans<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>ALYSA MILANO - going for the Hot for Teacher look today!  That is offensive to me that she is making me feel uncomfortable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrianKarem That was called THE BIDEN RULE... Democrats began that - also Garland will NOT be nominated ever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSNBC He has a lifetime appointment as a federal judge .... sorry to inform you and educate your ignorance.  He will not be impeached over allegations with no evidence.  Lets talk facts NOT emotions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amyklobuchar The polygraph was TWO questions?  Brett Kavanaughs name was NEVER mentioned under the polygraph... WEAK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ALYSA MILANO - She showed up and there was a seat with her "name tag" on it... bet it has been a while since she has had that kind of attention (or been up that early - thus the bun on top of her head)... Democrats had to settle for her as their "Famous" person in the courtroom!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HARRY43US Your shouting in CAPS is offensive to me and I would like an apology now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soupsnake813 You are aware of his newspaper article regarding him sexually assaulting a woman when he was 15?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very well said!  I completely agree with you.  I feel very sad for these women that have some emotional issues.  Your emotions cannot be my conviction!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GossSean42 @benshapiro ok... intelligent response.  And your nomination would be...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JacksonLeeTX18 @SenFeinstein @SenatorDurbin @SenBlumenthal @amyklobuchar @maziehirono @HouseDemocrats @SenKamalaHarris @CoryBooker @SenWhitehouse @ChrisCoons How about you add - Jackson Lee just handed Fords lawyer the cash payment for services from Soros?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Maybe the cash payment for his services from Soros!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Karengrisham1 Because it makes him look like a creepy deceptive obstructionist!! Love it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorahODonnell And that is okay?!  She accused him of something - mostly that he is from a wealthy, privileged, country club, private school lifestyle - and has not one person to back her up.  I thought the types of women in those circles would be all over that gossip! I do not want feelings...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Note to all: PAID POLITICAL AD and show complete LACK of objectivity.  Again, VERY happy I do not live in SF and have to say she is 'my Senator"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ByronYork Blumenthal gave a 4 minute talk about his own feelings.... nothing having to do with determining her Ford's credibility.  Mitchell asking questions regarding inconsistencies and exactly how long ago Feinstein got involved yet never said anything in private to Grassley....Hmmm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benshapiro I hope not!  Kavanaugh has already been crucified... this should not be allowed to happen to another SC nomination<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBSEveningNews I just HOPE that you will give Kavanaugh's questions the EXACT same level of detail to questions and comments asked!<|endoftext|>
