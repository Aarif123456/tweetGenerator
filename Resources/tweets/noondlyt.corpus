<|startoftext|>@mehdirhasan Even if he did deserve a party at one point. He is now sleeping with the enemy. There is no way he has not been compromised with Russian citizenship and Putin’s arm around his shoulder. He is no longer a patriot and has served his own self interest in protection. With our enemy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@0z_ozz What secrets?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@0z_ozz And what do you think they keep in the treasury department databases that would be a value to anybody<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@0z_ozz Not to entertain conspiracy theories but I don’t think it’s a coincidence that Edward Snowden is in the media for the potential of receiving a pardon from Trump and one of our government agencies has been hacked.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@just_tracytracy Awww, Thank you 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelingCrew @FBI @SecretService I agree in the less extreme cases. The mass conspiracy theories, the untrue political rhetoric, and the general belief that Trump is a messiah are a social disease and manageable. His rhetoric has hit home with so many(70m) who suffered illness before this. Revealed not created🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@just_tracytracy I wear a mask. 😉 But you can still call me an idiot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We must demand that these GOP be held accountable. They literally signed a document to subvert our democracy. This is sedition. There is a list FFS. #CriminalGOP #SeditiousGOP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelingCrew @FBI @SecretService This is our new reality. It has revealed that mental illness is far more widespread than we could ever have imagined. As far as the FBI goes, they data mine and look for key words. They have their hands full with Facebook, Twitter, and Parler. I have doubts about SS# tracking.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@real_batdude Interesting take. 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FalconRacer67 Better confirmation but awaiting more confirmation. This issue deserves critical attention with regard to information dissemination.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Garrett_M_Scott It’s a great organization. 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilykefinch Me toooo. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilykefinch You have more faith than I do.🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilykefinch The Trump administration has never cared about exposing anyone or notifying them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilykefinch This was the third subtweet in on your link.  https://t.co/MGpw4lbdrc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilykefinch Trump said it. I only react to that. I do not believe anything he says. It wasn’t “they”. It was Trump. The sources cited are “sources familiar with the situation” That’s not confirmation. He lies, always. The better question is why would trump act as Giuliani’s representative?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TG22110 Hmmmm  https://t.co/i0vZjwxV3d<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ofarrelltalent From a public safety aspect it’s not a positive if he recovers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The headline is literally “Trump Says”! When did everyone start believing what Trump says?!  Rudy Giuliani tests positive for coronavirus, Trump says  https://t.co/QStApfkELk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MWeaverCohe @CNN The headline is literally “Trump Says”  Rudy Giuliani tests positive for coronavirus, Trump says  https://t.co/QStApfkELk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MWeaverCohe @CNN CNN is simply reporting what Trump said. And the CBS coverage sites “sources”. Trump is not a source. He simply got up and made a statement and everyone took it as fact. There’s no evidence that he is sick at this time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Empath_g_app That’s the problem. They don’t provide proof of any illness and we accept blindly because we’re entertained. If he “recovers” that is a PR nightmare for safety mandates. If he gets better anyone can.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MWeaverCohe OK can you cite your source?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SKeithPryor I don’t either. If there is any documentation or proof that these cases were real within the GOP no evidence has been provided.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@vette_ed @RyanToh11 @jdgro3253 @2homesick @MelanieMetz6 @LeahR77 @JoeBiden Do you have the source for this one? I’d like to know what date this was specifically.  Also identifiers for the lab in Wuhan. This may be msm? There’s a good documentary that contains the accurate timeline information for the spread: Totally Under Control. I do recommend it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vette_ed @RyanToh11 @jdgro3253 @2homesick @MelanieMetz6 @LeahR77 @JoeBiden I do not trust unknown sources for material.

<|startoftext|>@vette_ed @RyanToh11 @jdgro3253 @2homesick @MelanieMetz6 @LeahR77 @JoeBiden I am afraid I do not know of those sources. I read research and investigate peer reviewed studies.

<|startoftext|>@yashar Any financial instruments can be manipulated by moves that the administration makes whether it is a bond fund, a equity fund, a index fund or individual stocks.

<|startoftext|>@raebyddet @yashar No because index funds can be manipulated by economic policies generated by the administration<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yashar I wholeheartedly agree. I worked in this industry for 15 years and the amount of conflict of interest is astounding.

<|startoftext|>Yes. Most were offered as part of an employment / severance package.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OleGelo5 @glennkirschner2 Trump took advantage of this. Weak minded corrupt people filled all of his cabinet positions. All with something to hide. Money and graft. We’ll see what happens with Barr, Pence, the kids, DeJoy, Miller, etc. All have fallen or will fall upon the sword for him. There is payoff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dgalan0577 @glennkirschner2 He’s retirement age, there’s money he’s going to get or already has received (theory) and he’ll be pardoned. Golden parachute. He won’t be doing time if it just appears that he’s been incompetent in his job. The question is what does he have to lose?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glennkirschner2 He does. I fear this has been a setup. Barr will take the fall for providing bad information to the president regarding potential voter fraud. Trump dissed Barr already this last week. This feels fake. If his AG misleads him about the election how can he use that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Quancth I think Barr is going to be the scapegoat. I think that was the plan the whole time. Trump is going to claim that Barr mislead him by providing reports of potential widespread voter fraud. Trump has already dissed Barr.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@one_goldie @Kimsuesmom @glennkirschner2 It gives me such a headache.   This is an interesting article - notice the date. No one paid any attention to it and so far it’s pretty damn on point. I don’t believe it will work except the 11th hour step down to have Pence pardon him.   https://t.co/R88dUYfFaZ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bookmeister54 @TG22110 @ashe2189 With every single tweet being blue lined. Ridiculous. He’s a cash cow for twitter plain and simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@one_goldie @Kimsuesmom @glennkirschner2 It’s actually not that black-and-white because that pardon would be thrown out as it would be an admission of guilt. Pardons can be thrown out if it is proven that he was committing crimes at the time that he pardoned himself. That has been the debate. A pardon is a self own.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Modge79022625 @grub12321 @WHNSC The NSC official site tweeted like a 15 year old boy mocking China.

<|startoftext|>@grub12321 @WHNSC How ignorant are you? Trump is a bad human being and has always been. If you overlook his overt racism, misogyny, and criminal handling of Covid then you are the naive one and I am happy you are not a citizen of this country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grub12321 @WHNSC Sure. The entire Australian wine industry relies on the table wine for the White House holiday feast. You must be confused.

<|startoftext|>Yes, and that’s how every pardon he issues is going to read. All of the naysayers regarding his powers need to accept this reality and it’s implications for the pardons that will be issued for his family members. Prepare yourselves.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sinnndy1 @Dknight10k Sounding like our current administration and the need to burn it all down and start fresh 😂. I’m sensing a pattern.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HelingCrew We cannot rid ourselves of stereotypes when half of our Congress is one. I can provide a list for you if you’d like. I’ll actually start with our president.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rwillson1969 @ResistDemNV @velvetrevulva88 Ahhh. Nostalgic.😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@magicsands @ResistDemNV @velvetrevulva88 Yes and predators.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelingCrew We’ll see going forward, but the fact that we celebrate every female addition to our governing body at this time speaks to the historic ineffectual nature of most women in congress. This is due to a culture of men. Pelosi has been the exception but she played the man’s game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelingCrew So does every human.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madbow1 @ImSpeaking13 @TidyCat Yes, I concur.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I am not leaving Twitter in January as many have decided to do. There will be a change and it will be a partial salvation but it needs tending, constant care. With that said here is my first spotlight choice #BadCitizen #DavidSirota  Please read, listen, and retweet. #SPOTLIGHT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Consider spotlighting those spewing divisive rhetoric and fascist propaganda early and often. It needs to be a constant barrage, not a focused attack 6 months before an election. There are so many with a megaphone (msm access) right now. Expose them and extinguish their fire NOW.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone should seriously consider the fact that the reason Trump lost was due to his mishandling of Covid. There will not be another Covid in 2 years or 4 years, thankfully. This means that we hold every leader and potential candidate accountable for their WORDS and actions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dknight10k @Spike12347 No one has been paying attention. We need to tear this type of person down and stamp them out to prevent another usurper from gathering power. He could be the next candidate so easily in our current world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@45isACrazyIdiot (correct answer 😉)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Spike12347 @Dknight10k Yes. We need to watch anyone who has a pulpit( media) from which to preach. THEY are the new guard that can replace Biden in 4 years.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@glennkirschner2 Excellent 👏👏👏👏 Something good to watch on Saturday Night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent first episode of #CapitalCrimes. Muth sounds very like a certain person that’s NOT running this country. @glennkirschner2 was great and I enjoyed this very much. Looking forward to the next Episode.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TG22110 @kendalldke Good article. Written by a financial analyst employed by UPS. Speaks to future opportunities available to logistics companies on the back of a super virus.

<|startoftext|>@HelingCrew Awesome unintentional shade<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kendalldke @TG22110 I’m just concerned that bills will be presented to the new administration for services that were never used to distribute this vaccine.

<|startoftext|>@dannotdaniel @HelingCrew LOL. Easiest way to tell if something is a reproduction is if it has a seam along the edge. That means it was cast.

<|startoftext|>@dannotdaniel @HelingCrew This was a sample design. It was never produced for circulation.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I see clearly today. The future of 45 &amp; Family looks like a cross between Bernie Madoff and Sadam Hussein. It will be complete financial ruin for all.

<|startoftext|>@MysterySolvent Yes. You can catch it again. And the virus will continue to mutate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sommcook @johnDAn41888972 Thank you! That is because Teenage girls who were not 18 in 2016 voted this year. These are young white women raised in MAGA households and indoctrinated into trumpism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankDe56205810 Just like the reality of this virus.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HelingCrew Monkeys flinging poop at the zoo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnDAn41888972 I don’t have to imagine it. My mother is from western Pennsylvania. That is prime MAGA country.  I have listened to every form from the mild Republican supporter to the extreme Maga that believe celebrities are drinking the blood of trafficked children. And those are the women.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McCainJack Oooh. Hmmm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnDAn41888972 That’s what I think it is. BUT, still, a horrible representation of women and not acceptable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrAndyNgo WWE is more convincing. The maga march was one medium sized circle jerk encompassing homo-erotic initiations of proud boy wannabes who could not fight their way out of a used condom. I watched the videos.  #WWERaw #InsecureBoys #WeakSauce<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BFPierceHawk @ChadKantReed @lmansley @nickgillespie 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanuckScots Where is this statistic sourced?  I think, if it’s accurate, you’re talking about 55% of women who voted. Greater than 40% of our population didn’t cast a vote.  I do want to see that source please.  Any woman voting for him is a mouthbreather<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AdamTexDavis Truth...or consequences of a populace that was fear stoked and lied to. A populace that has been effectively brainwashed and permitted to express closeted racism without fear of retribution. Believe in the vote and we can prevent it from happening again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelingCrew Key video shot at yesterday’s march looks suspect. There did not appear to be any counter protesters involved. I am dubious regarding most of the video recorded altercations. They looked like proud boy initiations.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@whiskeylegsn5th @B46751 @TG22110 @NeseStiller True. My confidence in our system is a bit shaken.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whiskeylegsn5th @MOubliette @B46751 @TG22110 @NeseStiller That I definitely understand because it is tangible. And there are I am sure criminal activity with regard to monies ongoing. My big question is Covid and The children held and separated from their parents. I fear this is going to get messy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whiskeylegsn5th @B46751 @TG22110 @NeseStiller I used to believe that until this year. And reading this article.    https://t.co/rPSIqAGqej<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whiskeylegsn5th @B46751 @TG22110 @NeseStiller Well that’s where the interpretation by his judges comes in. That’s the same interpretation that will be challenged when he attempts to pardon himself. The interpretation is where the crux of the matter lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whiskeylegsn5th @MOubliette @B46751 @TG22110 @NeseStiller How so?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tribune70251753 @whiskeylegsn5th @B46751 @TG22110 @NeseStiller Both of which are ongoing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whiskeylegsn5th @B46751 @TG22110 @NeseStiller Ongoing crimes is an interesting topic. So, could he be pardoned for his mishandling of the Covid virus?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B46751 @TG22110 @whiskeylegsn5th @NeseStiller I should re-phrase that. A pardon can be granted for crimes that may have been committed but have yet to be discovered or charged.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TG22110 @whiskeylegsn5th @NeseStiller Hmmm...Let me get back to you<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TG22110 @whiskeylegsn5th @NeseStiller 11th hour for the Coward-In-Chief. He will be substantially terrified at that point. If he doesn’t get a Federal Pardon than he can be charged with Treason in a number of cases.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TG22110 @whiskeylegsn5th @NeseStiller He cannot. But he can step down and Pence can then pardon him. A real possibility. He can do this on January 19th and most likely will.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whiskeylegsn5th @NeseStiller @TG22110 Actually he can be pardoned ( and anyone else can be) for any and all federal crimes in perpetuity. Charges do not have to be filed. Think about that for a moment...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aravosis @Quancth @DCPoliceDept What is going on here is unclear. It appears as if false flags are being thrown up to look like there are altercations. This looks suspect imho.

<|startoftext|>@MdlH @TG22110 I sat next to Jimmy Johnson from San Diego to ATL. Had no idea who he was but nearly every male passenger stopped to say hi as they were boarding.

<|startoftext|>@bblock29 They and others have gone all in. It’s either trump or potentially Treason now with a capital T. Everybody that supports that man and enables his madness is going to find themselves in court as traitors to this country. I’m entertained by the commitment. Foolhardy is the term.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joyful_optimist @H_MitchellPhoto @HKrassenstein Why do you think this is not true?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robinintheroses @H_MitchellPhoto @HKrassenstein No these are attorneys still file frivolous lawsuit after frivolous lawsuit unless they think they’re not going to be paid. Trump is broke. None of his attorneys are going to end up getting paid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nymiki These are attorneys we are talking about. Trump is broke. Attorneys will bill anybody till they’re in their grave. Frivolous lawsuits have never stopped attorneys from suing. What does he’s not getting paid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@djcriswell265 @H_MitchellPhoto @HKrassenstein I’m pretty sure, being attorneys, that they want to be paid also and apparently Trump is out of money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dknight10k it’s like a negative number squared. It becomes a positive. Or this👇  https://t.co/Rdtew2BfUj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@H_MitchellPhoto @HKrassenstein New: Overnight, the law firm Porter Wright stepped away from representing the Trump campaign in its federal suit in Pennsylvania. In a brief motion, lawyers said: "Plaintiffs will be best served if Porter Wright withdraws."<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@andartissa @elleb58 @TG22110 He was stunned that he won. That’s just as bad as knowing that you’re going to win. Remember he is also persona non grata with the Republican party because of his flip-flopping. I just want an audit.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dannotdaniel @HelingCrew The flipside of that argument is that liberal media or main stream media completely failed to do their jobs and hold our leaders accountable on a public forum. Both sides of the media are fully to blame for this. Which is a main point in the growth of fascism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IKababble @dannotdaniel @HelingCrew I think the point here is that you remove the stimulus the effect of that stimulus slowly erodes.  Trump will no longer be hitting the buzzer. He’s done.  We must make sure it doesn’t happen again by being vigilant and holding all of our leaders accountable to us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dannotdaniel No idea but let’s save it for a little bit until the raw nerves exposed on both sides have begun to scar over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dannotdaniel We are all capable of being “them” to one degree or another. That’s why we all need the intro to Fascism 101 so that it doesn’t happen again. Let he who is without sin cast the first stone. Hate begets hate. You can always choose to ignore those with whom you disagree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dannotdaniel You are right to feel that way. Just live with it. Don’t try to think your way in or out of it. Stay in this moment for a bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dannotdaniel No one hast to act tomorrow. We all need to sit with our emotions and our thoughts and decide how we want to proceed. This will take months not days not weeks, but months. Perhaps by January people will begin to move toward acceptance and reconciliation. stop rushing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TG22110 A low and a high. I want this poll because you have had a six hour nap(arguably) and someone mentioned a 15 minute nap. That’s not a nap. That’s not even a cat nap.  Mulling this over and welcome your ideas. I want the extremes in there.  15 min - - 6 Hours<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NJTeacher2 @TiggsAKAClaudia I am sorry for that. I hope he recovers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ASidweber @FoxParker @Dknight10k Yes, true. I think, going forward, we all need to manage our expectations of our leaders. As citizens, we fell asleep at the wheel and didn’t notice the rise of a dictator<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ASidweber @Dknight10k I don’t think landslide, but yes, He would have won.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theonlyjunedoe And he definitely will now. Wait for his nuclear meltdown. It’s coming between now and January.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxParker @Dknight10k No or he would have been removed from office when he was impeached. Or Impeached again with the other atrocities he’s committed while tearing up the constitution. People dying in large numbers is what lost him this election<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deebo8997 @Dknight10k We haven’t begun to fix what he has destroyed. In addition the world is aware we have 70 million people who voted for him. They will watch and wait to see what happens. Enjoy the victory today. It is a big one.✌️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dannotdaniel I will never speak or type the 🍊🤏🍆🍠’s name again. I will not listen to anything he says, nor read anything he posts.

<|startoftext|>@RyanToh11 Apparently his entire thread for the last 12 hours looks like this. 😁. Makes me warm and fuzzy inside.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanToh11 He needs to be brought up on charges but not until after January 20th. Otherwise, He can be pardoned or commuted by Trump. He can, in fact be pre-pardoned.  This was, most likely, a part of the agreement for him to torpedo the USPS.  I base this statement in precedent.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@catquotingseer @TG22110 WI is a interesting case study in moronic tendencies from a particular portion of the population. Especially considering the phenomenal institutes of higher learning located there. Science deniers seem implausible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MdlH @TG22110 Feel free to peruse my TL to catch up lmao. It’s a tad schizophrenic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TG22110 Well, regardless of state regulation, Trump will add WI to his suit list.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TG22110 WI is going to be contested. 11k vote difference with 90% reporting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeeNugLife @Life_Is_Fish I voted.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Fresh vocabulary I intend to sprinkle into my tweets:  Willfully Ignorant - When you ask, “How can so many people have voted for Trump knowing what we all know?” They don’t know.

<|startoftext|>@meritofapproval @AOC Exactly. He’s one screwed up piece-o-work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carolecadwalla @FoxNews Fox is fighting for their relevancy in this world after a Trump defeat. Do not give the scorpion a ride across the river. They need to pay for enabling Trump for 5 years. They were his fascist megaphone of propaganda and conspiracy. #FoxMustPay<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JulieSuburban @FURiousDEFENDER It's about the survival of the idea of democracy, and not one of them will be willing to be responsible for killing it. If they subvert the will of the voters, than democracy dies, period and full stop. They won't do it, watch.  3/3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JulieSuburban @FURiousDEFENDER Then they will consolidate every case, declare Biden the winner, and then the show is over. They have a 240+ year tradition of the peaceful transition of power to uphold. None of them want to be responsible for failing at that- it's all future historians will write about.  2/3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JulieSuburban @FURiousDEFENDER A wise person shared this:  It's gonna be a big spectacle, with a lot of noise and shiny objects and gnashing of teeth. A slew of lawsuits will be filed at the state level. SCOTUS will ignore it until about mid December.  1/3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IKababble Yep. I’m coping by switching. Aggressively making fun of idiots and then tweeting comforting logical and rational facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Between WI, MI, and PA there are over 7 million outstanding ballots - Twice the margin of the popular vote that Hilary Clinton had in 2016. This does not include any other states outstanding ballots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JulieSuburban @FURiousDEFENDER SCOTUS will not hear the case until after December 14th. The deadline for certification.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrew_rudick No. Not ever. I have my eyes on him. #DeJoyIsACriminal<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I just had a thought. If the networks never project T-Rump ahead he will not be able to claim victory. I just watched election coverage update 🤡’s projected wins to be ahead and immediately projected two other wins for Biden keeping him in the lead. 😲😉  @HelingCrew<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TG22110 @MegLavDC @ticktockumf2020 @TheRustyNail6 Read the witness statement. There was contamination of the menus by something that was supposed to be in the drawer. That is why the menus are no longer kept there.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nixw20 Glad you’re doing better today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think George W. Bush would have called them “the undeciders”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ariel817 That’s very good. And horrifying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@malinutt10 They are undecided at this point they will vote their conscience. I just don’t have any idea what piece of information they are waiting on to solidify their decision.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TG22110 Well I certainly didn’t think you’d be alone at the funny farm.  https://t.co/j1G0ipzglv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TG22110 This is like the takeout menus...  https://t.co/dPgqLEY8ka<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@calichicacine @nprpolitics Definitely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@calichicacine @nprpolitics I am aware of the cultural lean and somewhat assumed that they were probably not undecided. The immigration issues are a mess and I can see concern for that. I would not know what to say to an undecided voter at this point. Everybody needs to vote their conscience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@e_snacks That’s a Trump Voter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B46751 @huckelboy @TG22110 *snickering<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@let_america @huckelboy @TG22110 Keep in mind that nothing in this country has gone according to law or plan this year. A landslide doesn’t negate the fact that we have a tyrant in power until January 20 and a pandemic ravaging this country. I suggest managing expectations for election day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@huckelboy @TG22110 So rain check for you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TG22110 The sentiment is wonderful. If only we didn’t have to keep an eye on the narcissistic man-child after he loses. Covid doesn’t win on Nov 3rd either. I’ll  take a rain check on my two weeks for next year 😏<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#TrumpScoreboard I do not think it a coincidence that The worst month for the markets since March has occurred at the peak(so far) of Covid. The market correction in March was real. 213,000 Deaths and unmitigated financial struggles later our economy has been eviscerated. Wake up  https://t.co/7P0IboyI5g<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelingCrew That’s good 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@20jarett24 This is bad. The Election Tuesday is a priority but November 4th all focus needs to pivot to fighting Covid. We must continue to pressure The Senate and The House for Stimulus and states for mandates to protect as much of the population as we can.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AdamTexDavis @dannotdaniel @BFPierceHawk @TG22110 @HelingCrew @andrew_rudick @nixw20 @IAmJohnAles Putin had that set. Trump had no way to pay back the money due in 2016, now due 2020. Each time since 2004 the loan has been renegotiated for a 4 year term. As @Dknight10k tweeted earlier, it’s so obvious to everybody now that it cant be ignored. BTW, Plan B exists. He still owes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BGarfield I do not want court packing. I want court stuffing for Thanksgiving next year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump became president to pay back a loan using other people’s (US Coffers) money. He has done this through bankruptcies his entire adult life. It’s about nothing else #TrumpMO   @dannotdaniel @BFPierceHawk @TG22110 @AdamTexDavis @HelingCrew @andrew_rudick @nixw20 @IAmJohnAles<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AdamTexDavis Watching you tweet. Occam’s 🪒<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dknight10k I’ve been screaming, unheard, from the rooftops about this since his campaign in 2016. People (who voted for him) didn’t and don’t care. He’s been robbing US blind using taxpayer money to golf etc.Cost of this alone is 10% of the debt he owes. He became president to pay a loan 👀<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DuszaElizabeth @SurfnFitnes @StephenKing Screw it I’m having a @StephenKing weekend...  ...And The Green Mile.  So happy right now. Have to get snacks😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DuszaElizabeth @SurfnFitnes @StephenKing Not yet but in my list waiting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DuszaElizabeth @SurfnFitnes @StephenKing Definitely. But I’m used to that with his novels. Especially IT. Just thought of another...Hearts in Atlantis!! Awesome book and Fantastic movie - Anthony Hopkins - Come on!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DuszaElizabeth @SurfnFitnes @StephenKing One of the best productions! Loved the TV series Haven also. Will be binge watching both this weekend now😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DuszaElizabeth @SurfnFitnes @StephenKing Did you love Castlerock on Hulu??!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DuszaElizabeth @SurfnFitnes Yes. 💯 We’re going to have to start an SK book club.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DuszaElizabeth @SurfnFitnes Yes!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SurfnFitnes @StephenKing So weird. I remember this as a mini series but this is the production with Max Von Sydow and Ed Harris. Book is better, but cast is fantastic in the movie. Yes, This is Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SurfnFitnes @StephenKing When was the movie and how did I miss that remake ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SurfnFitnes OMG! Yes!! One of my favorite SK books. It wasn’t actually a movie. It was a miniseries. First tweet you’ve done that’s excited me. First time for everything 😃@StephenKing<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rachelnudge @birbigs @realDonaldTrump Well then perhaps quote a more recent article or study and don’t include the death totals for the US but break it down state by state. That information is available. Your argument is to general, based in antiquity as far as this virus goes and we are nowhere near the end of death<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rachelnudge @birbigs @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/FTHvmTKYNM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachelnudge @birbigs @realDonaldTrump An article that you posted as basis for your argument is from March. It is not the end and we are spiking. Deaths are Deaths. We will have far more than the predicted number, therefore it can be presumed that DJT did not handle this correctly as the whole world will attest to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachelnudge @birbigs @realDonaldTrump I have.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachelnudge @birbigs @realDonaldTrump Dr Birx is cleanup after the fact. Deaths are Deaths. It’s a shit show and you have blinders on to the facts. And we’re not just a little over 200000, we’re a lot. And the timeline is for year end not today. We will be over 400000 deaths by year end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachelnudge @birbigs @realDonaldTrump Please do not sound proud of 200000 deaths when Birx became involved long after DIPSHIT DONNY dropped the ball. This death toll is on his hands. Please educate yourself and don’t find joy in other people’s misery.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AdamTexDavis @m_ellery @heroshivers That is why I do not watch a lot of horror. I only watch psychological horror and it has to be good, really good.  The shaky camera, POV horror is garbage. Not a fan of slasher flicks but appreciate the B movie genre’s honesty. I do think Nightmare on Elm Street is great.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dannotdaniel Ted and I have had a falling out Like a prolapsed rectum. I can show you those pictures if you like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dannotdaniel @andrew_rudick @mikepompeo phonographs...the typo was funny... But, now that you mention it, yep, let me see the pornographs...  See what I did there?😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joesgotcrohns @YouTube @DonutOperator Trump rhetoric. “Good people on both sides”. Nooo. One hormonal person on one side in a position of power. A skilled rescue worker focused on aid on the other. These two things are NOT the same<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joesgotcrohns @YouTube @DonutOperator That is definitely a significant part of the problem with current law enforcement. Thin Blue Line.  #PoliceReform<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joesgotcrohns @YouTube @DonutOperator Good deal. I will definitely follow your story as it plays out. It is important for people to see it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dannotdaniel @andrew_rudick @mikepompeo How are damning phonographs going to trigger the rapture? Can you hear Helter Skelter on them? Was Grover Cleveland a Satanist?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is another example of poor response and training in Law Enforcement.👇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joesgotcrohns @YouTube @DonutOperator You should consider filing suit. Being a FF do you have friends on the force who are sympathetic to this situation? Also let me know if you don’t want to discuss publicly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joesgotcrohns @YouTube @DonutOperator OMG. So sorry. Wow. This is bad. I saw what he did to your shoulder in the video.<|endoftext|>
