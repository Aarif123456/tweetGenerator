<|startoftext|>@tonyschiavone24 Man, you had so much emotion in that call. Nostalgic as hell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cozmo23 Love how exotics were added exclusively to lost sectors and hunts. It shows I worked for them as opposed to them being given. Gives me a sense of accomplishment when acquiring one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Such a stark contrast in priorities. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  https://t.co/Pf28jOmvSh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamalaHarris So wait, our vote got us a great VP AND some new cornbread!?!? Amazing. üòÅ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SilverNumber1 Don't let it go to your head. Stay hungie Johnny. Stay hungie...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Wait, now those WEREN'T your cases? Lmao! You'll pass the buck to anyone as long as you don't have to admit a loss.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @RudyGiuliani @MariaBartiromo @RudyGiuliani does a great job exposing himself.  There, fixed it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JANELABABY If only he was wearing his stripy shirt. Be easier to find.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KCharlesBeaudr1 @CNN It won't be his pee, but he'll be laying in it. He likes that sort of thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You just lost AZ, and with it any chance you may have made up about winning. Bye.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MaripatL @fiinbob @SF7_1_5 @HKrassenstein @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris No, you're not leaving because you have no where to go. üòÇ The world has forbidden us from travelling because of how bad Trump fumbled the handling of Covid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden @KamalaHarris Thank you Mr. President- Elect for following science and taking this pandemic seriously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The reason Biden outran Obama is because more people voted in this election than any other. Its simple math really...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey guys, when is #Trump gonna pull the trigger on the dems with those secret watermarked ballots? #FireTheTrumpRegime #DontGetComplacent #SundayMorning #BidenHarris2020 #Biden2020 #USA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Windows were blocked because MAGA supporters were screaming and banging on the windows. Your people caused that. There are poll watchers from both sides in the facilities. Your lies won't effect the outcome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump But PA was already doing that. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Weird flex by SCOTUS but it makes no difference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Will they let you share a cell with Don Jr so at least you still have someone to throw under the bus when the soap drops?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump üòÇüòÇ There is no proof. You're throwing a fit. Someone needs to take your twitter away until you can behave properly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Corrupt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nico_Haeusler @AEW Yeah and it sucks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AEW We NEED more Abadon on Dynamite.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Well, game breaking glitch in Avengers on PS4. Once you find Stark and go through the house to acquire his suit parts I find his gauntlet. After putting it in I can't do anything. Can't aim, shoot or advance in the campaign.  @SquareEnix @CrystalDynamics @PlayStation<|endoftext|>
