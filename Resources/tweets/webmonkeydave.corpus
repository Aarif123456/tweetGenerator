<|startoftext|>Me: I don't know if I can do stand up when I don't even feel like laughing.  Also me: That's okay, no one laughs when you do stand up.  Me: Really? A meta joke?  Also me: I told you: you're terrible.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tracieching It's complicated and ever-changing, anywhere from Beckett to pop culture Star Wars references. But no matter how bad things get there's always Fred Rogers, telling me he loves me just the way I am, and that we should go help people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ComedyGrind: first live show since March. Felt like trying to run in a dream. Plus an enthusiastically drunk (but lovely) audience member.

<|startoftext|>@jackiekashian @niceolecookies @KitMoxie Oh and don't feel too bad. This is a deep cut from the teaser trailer that inexplicably didn't make it into the movie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jackiekashian @niceolecookies @KitMoxie If you don't watch the frenetic joy of @TaikaWaititi and smarmy brilliance of Tom Hiddleston on display in the final fight scene from Thor: Ragnarok at least once a month, are you really living your best life?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally! This whole time I've been mailing them in jars like a chump.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@leresatee Accidentally pointing out that these crimes against women are rarely investigated and lead to virtually no prosecutions.  I'm glad he supports aggressively criminalizing doxxing. So unexpectedly progressive!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mediocrefilms It's a little misleading because they leave out Brazil, which is somehow doing a worse job than the US per capita (2.1M cases and 79k deaths). But we're still #1 #Murica<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CarterBays That's only true if we let it be true. I was at the protests the day the DC mural went up. I was excited, but every single POC I talked to said, "So what? She hasn't supported us." Supporters need to learn to accept action, not promises.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PaulSzoldra This speaks volumes about all the other things he's said (and perhaps done) on the subject, presumably far more recently.

<|startoftext|>@CatoInstitute And what, monetarily or behaviorally, will stop Police Unions from pooling money from "good" cops to cover "bad" cops' premiums rather than allow one of their own to be fired? Your solution seems to have an obvious problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LethalityJane There will be nothing good that comes to light in this case. It's horrible all the way down, and S/NCOs should have done something. That's the hard truth.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TookyMonster The bible does not specifically rule out tough love.

<|startoftext|>@CarterBays I hope he does get the attention he deserves in the expanded canon. I'll watch/read the hell out of that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In honor of @anylaurie16's mom, I will drink coffee &amp; complain about my kid while reading Fox News.  Then I'll go slap some bitches not wearing masks, because she was definitely the kind of lady who would want REVENGE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fleetwoodhawk You absolutely do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarterBays I'm not disappointed about Kylo/Rey's arc (or that Rey exists at all), but I agree that Finn's story never went anywhere post epVII, to the point that I started to dislike when he did show up: it felt like they were poorly shoehorning him into a plot that had moved on without him<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Rev_BlueMoon @AFPayne6 @CastingGlances @jeneps Murky is this: 1344.10 states that members must avoid the impression of endorsing a candidate. Other laws (that don't directly apply but that are referenced in military training on the subject) define campaign items that were used. There's no precedent for how to resolve that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rev_BlueMoon @AFPayne6 @CastingGlances @jeneps Exempt from what? I don't see any reference in the directive that states that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rev_BlueMoon @AFPayne6 @CastingGlances @jeneps Correct, but we were talking about the Hatch Act and it's applicability to Trump. However, DoDD 1344.10 does specifically prohibit the display of large campaign signs on vehicles and residences, so that _could be_ applicable here. Like I said, it's unprecedented and murky.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyRichter It's so nice of them to imply that you were, at some point, hinged. That's the kind of nurturing sentiment lacking in today's news media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rev_BlueMoon @AFPayne6 @CastingGlances @jeneps Not my opinion: it's the law: "For example, while on duty or in the workplace, employees may not: wear, display, or distribute items with the slogan “Make America Great Again” or any other materials from President Trump’s 2016 or 2020 campaigns..." I can get fired for that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CastingGlances @jeneps Trump announced his candidacy for 2020 in February 2018. While unprecedented so early after being elected, it nevertheless gives him the protection of the Hatch Act.  https://t.co/7TzvOsyeTa<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mediocrefilms Dad, what was nutrition like in the 70s?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>7. For my own part, the $80 I would have spent on a ticket is instead going to my favorite local female comic. I've also pulled the white guy joke from my set until I can rework it to address the absurdity more directly. Not much, I know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>6. Until then I'll hope he makes amends. I hope he does the hard work. I'll be sad for the loss of his voice in my comedy universe while refusing to forget the many comic voices he helped silence because he was, &amp; remains, reprehensible &amp; weak. Redemption is not about time served<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>5. That answer is no. I saw him in DC in 2016 (with the brilliant @michelleisawolf). 6 months later I did my first open mic. Not a coincidence. But there are too many female comics who won't get to perform because of his direct actions &amp; those of his fans. I can't support that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4. #LouisCK is performing again. If he seeks or deserves redemption isn't for me to say. I hope he does the right thing, &amp; I hope that comes from a place of sincere regret and not simply careerist damage control. That's all out of my hands. I only control if I'll go see his show.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3. I wasn't exactly surprised about his grotesque behavior--he never presented himself as anything but a gross guy--but I was and remain disgusted. If he used his power to kill female comics' careers, he needs to fix it. That female comics stopped performing is tragic. Full stop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2. #LouisCK isn't the only comedian who's inspired me to try standup, but I can't name a larger influence. He's the performer I wanted to be, and in many ways still is. His writing is brutally honest, his performance seems effortless (it's anything but), &amp; an hour a year? Insane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay, so #LouisCK isn't the most important issue, &amp; my opinion surely holds little weight. But as an aspiring standup comedian who happens to be a white guy (&amp; has a joke about how easy that makes starting in standup) I feel like it's also my responsibility to speak up. So FWIW..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I just realized that I'm in a Twitter-off with an LA stand up comedian who I've seen on @midnight. On the one hand I disagree with him. OTOH he's a former @Midnight champion, so I think that means he automatically wins all internet arguments. #HardiwcksLaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But if you're just being a snarky dick... well actually I appreciate that. What I don't appreciate is having the staggering lack of meaningful national debate on the issue of gun violence derailed by this kind of cherry picked BS #VetsForGunReform<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SO if you're being sincere, and this issue has deeply affected you or those you love, and I've completely misread your motive, I apologize for blowing your well-intentioned shout into the wilderness completely out of proportion. I hope less people get bitten by dogs, too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or perhaps the timing isn't coincidental and you're being a deflecting jackass, trying to pass off a false equivalency as a relevant piece of the public health debate over gun violence and reform. Honestly I don't know. That's the curse of Twitter. I don't know you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And perhaps you're being sincere about all this. I'm certainly not claiming that it isn't a problem. I am still claiming that it's not as important a problem as many others, and the nature of human attention and resources being what it is, I'd prefer we tackle other issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And of course it's already illegal for a dog to bite someone, so really passing new laws won't help. The real solution is for more people to own dogs. The only thing that stops a bad dog is a good dog, after all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or perhaps this is a mental health issue, and what we really need to address is the culture of violence surrounding dog ownership. Or maybe it's that once gay and trans people were allowed to own dogs is when this really became a problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But now that we agree it's A problem, what will we do about it? Have a national discussion? That would be nice, but I can hear the Big Woof lobby crying that since 12,000 bog bites happen per day (1,600 serious ones), we're too emotional and now is not the time to discuss it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gravity, BTW, is still the king of injury at 9.1M. That is admittedly more difficult to ban than dogs. Gravity is quite useful and pernicious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That puts it at #15 on the list of unintentional injuries for all Americans in 2016. So while yes, it's a problem, I would still say that your emphasis is misplaced. You'd be better served trying to ban bicycles (404k) or everything else that bites/stings (1.1M)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StoutRyan 600,000 Americans annually require inpatient care for dog bites. Based on MY research (which is actually OUR research because it comes from the government) the number is closer to 370k, but that's admittedly squishy and there's ample reason to believe it's higher...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StoutRyan @FiveThirtyEight I admit, I find your CUNNING use of YELLING to be PERSUASIVE. (No, seriously. SORRY if that sounded SARCASTIC. See? I can't do it as well.)  So let's reset so I can address your concern...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StoutRyan Wow, I haven't seen someone tank a statistical analysis that badly since @FiveThirtyEight called the election for Hillary.  Seriously, if you're just going to throw out random jingoism I think we're done here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StoutRyan That would be "W54 (Bitten or struck by dog)." 553 deaths from 1999-2016, if you were wondering, so not quite the scourge as you originally suggested.  https://t.co/L0WxwIjlrq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StoutRyan There is a list. It's kept by the CDC. Heart disease is important, which is why the government spends millions researching ways to reduce deaths. In fact the only cause of death they're specifically prohibited by congress from studying is gun violence.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Did you catch my interview with #chefkristen?  She's just as wonderful (and delightfully profane) as she is on TV!   http://t.co/f9O3ncKoJn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ChefKristen I would prep for Chef Kristen any day (she's a lot better looking than Rich Grandzol)   http://t.co/GIKVXIRV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wistdom The Matrix has you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear NBC, shut up shut up shut up shut up shut up shut up #openingceremonies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe Bottlenose will actually get me to check this thing regularly.  Other signs of the apocalypse to follow...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimGaffigan I didn't know you had a Norwegian twin brother. Which one of you is evil?   http://t.co/VDC3Kex2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@struiling I don't think you know how sleep works<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>thanks for the Dulles flyby, NASA!! #spottheshuttle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alan_tudyk "The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze" leaps to mind.  If you want Velveeta go for 5th Dimension "Up, Up and Away"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crushgear I'm stunned no one has remade "Dave" yet. #hollywoodislazy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dichenlachman oh that popcorn is delicious!  Have you tried the chocolate-drizzled caramel flavor.  *drool*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>store pickup line 3x as long as the regular line.  WTF #bestbuy #yourdoingitwrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@struiling Grats!  Now I just need an EE project :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crushgear You're forgetting that pilots can invoke Sky Law :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crushgear Filters are your friend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@struiling &lt;kungfuMovie&gt;Ha! Stomach bug is no match for your Iron Stomach style, Sriracha technique! Ha!&lt;kungfuMovie&gt;<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ActuallyNPH Should have been you!  Then I would have actually watched it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if it weren't for Twitter, I wouldn't have nearly so complete a picture of how boring my life is #ignoranceisbliss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crushgear if only you'd read it on an iPad and tweeted this via iPhone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wore my new Dr Horrible t-shirt yesterday and my dreams were full of bro time with @jedwhedon and a cameo by @ActuallyNPH.  Magic t-shirt?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@struiling ahem...... what now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alan_tudyk your extensive plumbing-based wit has always impressed me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@struiling plenty of time to pack then ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crushgear @upstatement Okay that's just wicked cool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizVassey Come visit! americanhistory.si.edu  Eats: 1759, Medium Rare, Jaleo, and Five Guys (better than in-n-out; yep, I said it)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@struiling How hard can it be?  I'm sure there's an app.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@struiling it's always hurricane Mom season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2 hours on hold friday to change flights and you deleted our reservations?  I could have done that by myself, jerks #unitedsucks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@struiling Wouldn't miss it for the world<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do we really still consider "Texas Governor" an acceptable prerequisite for the Presidency?  Really?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoTancharoen I love how Jed is happy but the cat looks annoyed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@struiling friends : tech support<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG, it's like Etsy for graphic design!   http://t.co/CV2Ojac<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[witty, bimonthly observation]<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoTancharoen At least Obama's (pay) Freeze Ray seems to be working.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>spending my day off at the DMV #poorlifechoices<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NathanFillion Guns?  Taser?  It takes a real man to down a perp with candy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@struiling as long as your wedding site validates, everything will be fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@struiling Do we need to have "the talk?"  (you know, the one about protection... from data loss?)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a brand new day #drhorrible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>feeling 100 years old and 1,000 years behind schedule<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CosmosDarwin Well I can't claim any credit since I'm no longer at MIT, but I just wanted to add my congratulations!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@struiling No way I'm competing against you.  You've got boobs, which is the anabolic steroid of gamer-baiting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoTancharoen Sadly, odds are she'll have her own reality show by the end of the week.  *sigh*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>George Oates.  Interesting person in an uninteresting discussion.  Maybe next time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll get to SXSW one of these days.  Maybe I should start a bake sale.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whedonesque that's one hell of a loaded question. Why not ask about the future of fan-funded productions instead?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dichenlachman I've always suspected that you were solar-powered<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoTancharoen oh no!  The pacific rim has cracked our Bieber technology!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@struiling oh sure, now you tell me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>no dynamic footers?  I feel like I'm coding in torn jeans while watching OJ's low speed pursuit and listening to Pearl Jam's new album.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@struiling no that's not until June.  You must have misread your calendar.  This is puppies and unicorns week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whedonesque Paul, Epitaph pt 2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>enjoying the bi-weekly "oh hey this Twitter thing is still here" moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@struiling as it should be<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ryanthegoober Ryan's priorities &gt; Elizabeth's priorities<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoTancharoen @MTVGeek @JedWhedon A late christmas present!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"will we see more Dr. Horrible, either in web or in comic book form?"  "MT & JW: Yes."  I feel that a *SQUEE!* is in order.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#whyImcynical<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@struiling You may want to add the keywords "chapel" and "shotgun"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@struiling What are you, Amish?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@struiling that is not part of the EULA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoTancharoen Best news I've heard all day.  Yay!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want to be slathered in Icy-Hot and sleep for a week.  Is that weird?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@struiling PR is one of my favorites<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Tron" was awfully shiny, had a kicking soundtrack, and was full of Olivia Wilde goodness.  Other than that...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would like to go through one day without being ambushed by other people's inability to do their job.  My schedule is full, thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>it's so cold I'm going to start measuring in Kelvin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoTancharoen inconceivable! #imonthewrongcoast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoTancharoen Where's your comic?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whedonesque what is this, Sophie's Choice?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>is officially convinced that I'm not interesting enough to be on Twitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whedonesque "hey remember the time when..."  Well that and how scary rabbits are.  Love that show.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All alone in the office today.  Disappointed that nothing has sprung magically to life. #lifeismoreentertaininginmyhead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Changed trains to sit near someone I thought was Grace Park.  She was not.  Clearly I need a new audiobook to better occupy my mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NathanFillion I'm pretty sure that's still a compliment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@struiling God forbid you spoil your perfect "arrive in the nick of time" record<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jchawes good luck!  I'll look for fresh bruises on the next episode :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>it's pronounced Frankensteen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have to stop following so many LA residents.  It's giving me ideas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't get it.  Where's the "Like" button on this thing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@struiling "The Logic Tree" unfortunately didn't sell well in the midwest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@struiling You could, oh what's the word, relax?  Is that it?  Sounds unfamiliar...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoTancharoen Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery; it is also the least likely to share the profits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>bored. bored. bored.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@struiling maybe they can switch so they won't lose the deposit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoTancharoen @theguild You know, there's a whole _other_ coast out here that loves you.  You should come visit sometime :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm glad I get paid to keep up with tech like Twitter, because otherwise it would seem like a lot of work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've decided that reading tweets of fantastic people who all live in LA is not conducive to my well being when I don't live there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoTancharoen Tim Gunn is fabulous on the inside, too.  Not that I ever doubted it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahphymn How about just a "Hello! My Name is" tag with "None of your business" written in?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I still don't entirely see the point of Twitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoTancharoen Dear lord, that was the funniest thing (not written by you) I've read in years!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>alarm clock FAIL.  *grumble grumble*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm on twitter.  It must be 3am.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahphymn me?  How'd you know I'd be on here?  You're *psychic!*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One day I'll have a smart phone and actually check Twit more than once a month.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>wondering when I'll care enough to update the outdated Bagram logo on my Twitter page.  Twitter template or fix up house to sell.  Hmmmmm...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@struiling I would think being photographed in a dress would top your list of phobic responses :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@struiling Sunday night, probably late.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@struiling what, no PhD?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@struiling packed yet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The answer still isn't "no."  And I still don't get Twitter.  Maybe if I had an iPhone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wondering how long it will be before the answer to "Do you want to go back to the war" will be "no".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wondering if "I don't wanna grow up, I'm a Toys R Us kid" works as a resume objective<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@struiling I think you hit your audience very well, so stop moping and bask in a job well done ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm cheating on Twitter with Facebook.  I... I feel so dirty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@struiling that's just lubricating your intestines for all that healthy food you ate.  It's a perfectly valid nutritional plan... I assume<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahphymn end of Jan, though it'll have to wait until I'm actually out of here.  It's an unnecessarily vague and complicated process<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm engaging in self-destructive hermitude.  I'll try to convert to constructive hermitude but I make no promises.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's amazing how sleeping for 12 hours improved my mood after not sleeping for 48<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@struiling oooooo sounds delicious.  Can I come, too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sleeping in my flight suit and waiting for the pager to go off.  Well not so much as pondering sleep in an abstract way while horizontal. Ug<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Starting to pack up my things to head home.  Where did all this crap come from and why is it all so heavy?!?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@struiling Set them straight, CSS goddess!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sitting on alert and fanboy obsessing about Maurissa Tanchroen.  Who wants to help with the harmonies for my new song, "Groupie Groupie"?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@struiling silly rabbit, they only need 7 to figure out you're awesome enough for a real interview<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahphymn I hope you left room for my fabulous homecoming party.  I'm thinking a Dr. Horrible / karaoke theme... :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@struiling I think that depends on location.  Couch: yes.  Best Buy: not so much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>wishing everyone a happy new year!  No champagne, or for that matter kisses at midnight for me, so be sure to overcompensate on my behalf.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@struiling home of tiny sausages and finger cookies?  Fantastic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>feeling a little more centered today.  that was a rough ride.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm driving a spork into my leg.  Hilarious!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahphymn What a crazy random happenstance!  I can't wait for the DVD to show up.  Unfortunately it'll take a week.  Grrrr.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>trying to channel that elf work ethic and get things done.  I'm really not feeling it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahphymn tell that fabulous expat I said hello!  And have a great Christmas!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>back from Germany and trying to decide between regret, resignation or rejoice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>avoiding responsibility<|endoftext|>
