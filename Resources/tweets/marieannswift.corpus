<|startoftext|>@mindserenade @PaulEmbery No sadly everyone is not trying to do their best / Tory gov have cut services massively - as a cancer patient I see this every day - many more people r homeless - mentally ill people r on street - access to drug /  alcohol services is v poor - fewer police - DA etc<|endoftext|>
