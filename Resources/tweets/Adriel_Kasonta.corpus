<|startoftext|>@k_doremus This childish, empty triumphalism is dangerous. Humiliating Trump's voters (de facto also Americans) in words and gestures will only further accelerate anger and sense of exclusion from the society. Dems are no longer representing the working class.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@k_doremus That's why I've never liked IR books. They all sound like uncritical advertisement of some potent ideas, rather than critical (unbiased) research.

<|startoftext|>@novussubsole @BrankoMilan Still, "unlikely" doesn't mean impossible. There is a Polish saying: "Tonacy brzytwy sie chwyta" (eng. "Desperate men do desperate things"). Soviets were desperate and many scholars fear that this desperation could have pushed them to deal with Poles more decisively (brutally).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@novussubsole @BrankoMilan The communist party (&amp; system) was already in a process of collapse. Party aparatchiks were divide over responses to losing their grip on power. Jaruzelski was a safe choice and Poles preferred him over Soviet general unknown sent to "restore" the "law &amp; order".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While everyone in the West (esp. UK) like to cry about Ukrainian 'Holodomor' caused by Stalin, no one seems to be interested in reassessing #WinstonChurchill's role in the #BengalFamine... you gotta love their double-standards.  https://t.co/cIHy5ZK5h6 via @HistoryExtra<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrankoMilan PS. What I meant by that is that Jaruzelski was a lesser evil, because we could have suffered  from Czechoslovak-alike solution being imposed by Moscow. After all, Jaruzelski was an army man and, from what I know from my grandparents, he wanted to save the country from the chaos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrankoMilan But it's unpopular to speak (esp. in the West) that CEE is full of paradoxes. Some communists (like Gierek) were perceived by many as patriots, but because of their party affiliation are currently discredited. Besides, Moscow's control differed &amp; Poland's case is quite unique.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrankoMilan As same as all your tweets. I really enjoy them! In the case of this one, just wanted to add some thoughts about, so to speak, "my topic" - both in Poland and now at LSE, under Prof. Vesselin Dimitrov 🙂 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In Poland, CP surrendered power to Jaruzelski because the party was in tatters (internally divided and against Gierek), as well as lost credability as a "legitimate" representative of the working-class people's will, which image was effectively challenged by Solidarity movement.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@novussubsole @pvl1111 @BrankoMilan PS. I don't disagree with you, but there are much more layers to this truth. As for Slavophiles and intelligentsia, due to globalism people are not linear, they tend to be more eclectic in their thinking. Outdated and simplistic, but I catch your drift.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@novussubsole @pvl1111 @BrankoMilan Why we distinguish between Russians/East Europeans and Jews? It's just complicating the varieties of outcomes. Furthermore, it is too complicated to discuss as paradoxical issue as East European/Russian (including Jews from this region) psyche on Twitter. Contexts are crucial.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@novussubsole @pvl1111 @BrankoMilan Agree. Also have few Russian Jewish family members and I can attest that (sadly) you're right.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@novussubsole @pvl1111 @BrankoMilan True dat, but liberal/conservative is an outdated cleavage. The problem is that ppl in CEE fully buy into Western narrative (even about themselves) while at the same time they're abandoning their own narrative for the sake of being progressive/acknowledged.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SekretarzXXL @novussubsole @BrankoMilan There is no sense of superiority here at all.

<|startoftext|>@novussubsole @SekretarzXXL @BrankoMilan Yup, they tend to be unreflective, but only because the political discourse is so limited. Mainstream politicians use the same tactic, where they divide people into communists and anti-communists, where the truth is much more complicated. The East is full of paradoxes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SekretarzXXL @novussubsole @BrankoMilan Sorry to say this, but this is why East Europeans are so limited. They worship a statue of a man who would have rather joined protesters over understanding the complexity of the American society and its foundations. This is the main problem with East Europeans. They're limited.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SekretarzXXL @novussubsole @BrankoMilan Dear God, here we go again. Here is my take and let it sink in:  https://t.co/86YWTsPRpe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SekretarzXXL @novussubsole @BrankoMilan Dlaczego wkladasz do jednego worka Pilsudskiego z Ukrainskim psem Bandera?

<|startoftext|>@novussubsole @BrankoMilan My dear, I perfectly understand your argument, but I have no intention to be argumentative or win/lose any battle of thought with you - it's Twitter. If you think that your argument is correct, then so be it. It's Saturday, so why not being generous towards strangers?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@novussubsole @BrankoMilan And the guilt is related to? Kosciuszko was the first abolitionist ( https://t.co/MUdddA5qTM) and Poles were fighting against Napoleon to liberate Haitians ( https://t.co/PhyFTeuzo3). So the argument is weak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@novussubsole @BrankoMilan Disagree, but some put this as an economic argument against the Slavs, arguing that we perceive the West as the benchmark of success. We didn't exploit Africa, Middle East and India, so it's difficult (even if one is fully buying into neoliberal orthodoxy) to achieve their level.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrankoMilan And no, I'm not a 'Russian spy'. I simply understand the paradoxes of our region, which are skillfully exploited by Western politicians. It's sad, because East Europeans have so much too offer, yet the inferiority complex prevents them from achieving their full potential.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrankoMilan Well, the problem is that East Europeans (especially Poles) are equating anti-Sovietism with Russophobia. The problem is deep and psychological. PS. Thanks for retweeting. Dziekuje :)  https://t.co/jQVM1i52ny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Enopoletus @BrankoMilan Don't put Russians into one box with 'East-Europeans'. There is a difference between fulfilled Slavs and those who are unfulfilled. The former still believe that we are in the Yalta days and have revanchist mindset towards the latter, where the latter simply moved on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrankoMilan Perhaps you're a bit provocative hear, but you hit the nail on the head. As in the case of Poland, the so called 'anti-communists' are romanticizing people like Churchill (his statue). It looks that they can't define themselves without the West.

<|startoftext|>The only hope for #Africa to finish the process of #decolonialization is in Moscow and Beijing.

<|startoftext|>@RobertJ11401472 @paczubihotmail1 @TorahJews @Haaretz Sadly it's true. But world can't comprehend that for instance my 89 years old Jewish Grandmother doesn't care about #Israel or #Israelis. All she knows is that "they are dangerous like German Nazis", who kept her in #LitzmannstadtGhetto, and that they're foreigners. #diaspora<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paczubihotmail1 @TorahJews @Haaretz Israeli #Jews don't mean anything to me and my Jewish family, so let them stay as far from our #diaspora as possible, since they are alien to us and our #Jews. They are butchers just like our German Nazi oppressors. They're the cancer with #stockholmsyndrom! #Israelis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@haaretzcom are the worst frauds ever for pretending to be the voice of ALL #Jews. They don't speak in my name (and many other Eastern European Jews), so they can stick their advice into their #Zionistic Israeli asses and simply bug off! #IdentityHijackers!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sure, and that's why we had its sequel in the form of #WWII.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, it's not only #Russia which is responsible for the #MinskAgreements fulfilment. Perhaps it will be better if everyone will focus on its own part, rather than supporting further destabilization of #Ukraine by, among others, supporting neo-Nazis there? Just sayin'... #America<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's called the #realisticconflicttheory (RCT). It's when members of one group are interested in creating a negative image of the opponent to raise the morale of their own group, which increases the chance of defeating him. An additional benefit is a sense of superiority, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn respects #democracy and its legitimate outcomes, but thought that professor of 'politics, philosophy and law' should know better.

<|startoftext|>@amconmag So basically, the so called "German-American mythos" is deeply rooted in paganism.
