<|startoftext|>@ChelseaClinton @Facebook I think this may have been my last straw @markzucky and Facebook I’m out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcorubio If you a true Christian you would have never supported @POTUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chelseahandler @StephenMiller No not to soon. His own family disowned him. I hope they take him out in handcuffs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid Hell no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FLOTUS So what do you say to the Republicans that won? The same thing you wore on your back to see children locked up or the same thing you said about Christmas?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaraLeaTrump There was integrity and you lost. Accept it and get out of the people’s house. It’s time to reunite the UNITED STATES of AMERICA. You and your family have done enough damage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChelseaClinton Finally a woman!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid God lord how do people believe this shit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid Oh she cray cray!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeccaTampa @DevinCow @JaneWallaceL These photos are so disturbing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteButtigieg @staceyabrams @staceyabrams is a freakin shero!! We owe her and some many others a big thank you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid I’m heart broken. What’s the matter with this country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid 🤢<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@michpoligal @freep Um that’s a hell no. You broke the law you pay the price. So many folks in jail fo do less they don’t get a walk free excuse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahpaulsoning @nbcsnl please let’s get a Twitter going to get Sarah Paulson to host SNL!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid Why why do they have to be so obnoxious?? 🤦‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maddow The guy in the black truck needs to be arrested. There is so much video on tic tok of the black truck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maddow Why are Trump supports so freaking obnoxious and dangerous?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid They had some stupid parade in our  town last weekend. Gross<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDailyShow Never liked him! When he suddenly showed up at DWTS stalking his future wife done and done!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChelseaClinton That was amazing!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhilEhr Rick Gates is a scared to stand up@to a real man!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SarahBCalif Umm they could have just scanned them to you????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteButtigieg Love you Pete!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DemSeattle @DevinCow They are a special bunch for sure!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid It’s a disgrace that she accepted the nomination. It says a lot about her character and how she will rule.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump We would love if you and your father would leave and save Floridians tons of money for each and everything time you come it cost us hundreds of thousand dollars. Not the $750 your father pain in taxes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DevinCow That rich! She should have never accepted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcorubio The low level the GOP sinks to is amazing to me. This entire thing is a slap in the face to the American people. How a rule is fine for them but does not work for all is beyond acceptable. The GOP has changed us from the United States to red and blue states.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteButtigieg Love you Pete I hope you are our next President 2024<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AP @maddow Horrible. How can she be confirmed. #MoscowMitchMcConnell and #LindseyGraham are horrible people and such hypocrites. Vote them out!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@robreiner Me too! My anxiety is at a peak I am not sure I can handle.  Please vote!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidCornDC What is the matter with these people? There’s no content. What are you going to do about the pandemic, the economy, the crazy growing deficit? Where is the real content?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast Ewww I don’t want to see him in bed or anywhere else 🤢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MiaFarrow Ummmm hard no on that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DrBiden I 🙏🏽 you will be our First Lady and restore dignity to our country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kirstiealley @realDonaldTrump Gurl you need to educate yourself and not be the follower and koolaide  drinker that you are. He was handed a great economy and squandered it like he does everything else in his life. Wake up.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden This Florida vote has your vote and so does my Republican husband!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@greenfield64 @JoyAnnReid No he continues. Why should he suspend? Biden is taking the steps that all Americans should have been taking. Wear a mask social distancing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden You are very kind Vice President. Especially after the way he attacked your family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cynn99 @chrissyteigen Who thinks they have a right to judge how someone grieves. She also is probably helping so many people who are going through the same situation. Back of the judgement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepKatiePorter Yes you did and you are amazing!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KateBennett_DC @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Now that’s so real 💩!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedcruz you are telling lies when you say the states with the worst cases are all with Democratic Governors the top ten states with cases are split 5 Democratic 5 Republican. Top 20 with cases 11 Republican and 9 Democratic. Stop telling lies. #fakenews<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DevinCow Omg yes yes yes! Why this is not shouted from the roof tops I don’t understand. If you talk to a teacher or faculty member and listen to what this is doing to them not to speak of the children it’s unimaginable that this is where we have decided to put the burden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast Not this white girl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lisastark351 @senatemajldr It’s shocking that our country has accepted terrorizing our children and not changing anything when it comes to guns.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gtconway3d @DevinCow @GOPChairwoman Have you lost your mind? He would have never served in WW2 the big chicken he is! Please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliRogin @DevinCow Because the young men that served and lost their lives were fans? Come on. It’s because his daddy had money that he did not serve. How can he be a President of the US?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MCITLFrAphorism Did he make Catholic priest child molesters? Glass houses sir glass houses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 Can’t love this enough!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThomasJTobin1 The most harmful thing to children are catholic priest who hide behind the collar to molest children and the Catholic Church covers it up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast That’s what happens when you have hate in your heart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NOW1SOLAR @MollyJongFast @PaulLeeTicks This is the best thing I have seen in a long time!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanRather great interview with Billy Bob Thornton. I learned so much about him and have such a different feeling and respect for him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobAnderson2018 Why can’t he get it done now? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kharyp This is so disturbing. Please someone identify this less than human person and at the very least get him fired.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ProtectTheCow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottforFlorida @CoryBooker What is wrong with registering guns? We have to register cars, pass test to drive, have insurance, and pay every year to update our tags. Why can’t we do that with guns? How deep are you in the NRA’s pocket?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepTedDeutch @AndrewGillum Florida’s voting is a joke. Still not fix since the hanging chad. We are a joke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC @ScottforFlorida everyone should watch the piece people who served their sentence and want their voting rights back. He held hearings and asked some of the most inappropriate questions and turn almost all of them down. He’s as bad for Florida as @mattgaetz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shannonrwatts @NRA Oh you are new kind of horrible. Way to go NRA. You really know how to relate to what these families who have lost children are going through.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DLoesch @DevinCow How you feeling anout another AR shooting today? I hope you sleep well at night,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Comey You are one of the biggest reasons we are in this mess. I blame you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomcolicchio I love this!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maddow We can not survive a second term.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanRather It’s going to be so redacted that we will never know the truth. Maybe someday someone will release the real report.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDailyShow Are you kidding me @FoxNews how about he is setting a great example of how important it is to wear a helmet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lane_rayne Rolling back women’s right systematically. These are scary times for women.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@krfroschauer Everyday we get closer to the Handsmaid’s Tale. Stripping women’s rights away piece by piece.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoyceWhiteVance He is a horrible human. He will not be  re-elected in Florida we will make sure of that. Micheal Cohen will pay for his misdeeds and he should. But yo send threats how could this be legal?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@deschall @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump I think you should inform yourself on the evidence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump We need a national emergency for gun control. Bring out all the parents that lost a child due to gun violence on the rose garden lawn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichelleObama @aliciakeys @MichelleObama see you up there was so moving. I miss having an amazing First Lady that was such an inspiration.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ElianneAlexande @WHOSAY @ICBINotButter I think it would be s very good idea for you to look into the ingredients of margarine vs. grass feed butter!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicolleDWallace @samstein Distraction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@keithboykin @realDonaldTrump Do you think I can walk into my local Publix grocery store go to check out with a cart full of groceries and say hay can you work around? Are you that out of touch? They have no idea who I am. When was the last time you purchased groceries? Never!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@delaneytarr White Boys. Who should have absolutely no say in what women decide what is right for their bodies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CityFurniture is giving the worst customer service. Help my son purchase a couch and loveseat. The completely messed up delivery. They have waited weeks for it. Now they say they have wrong address and he will have to go to store which is three hours away. What a mess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RachelRGonzalez The Dems better shut her down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDailyShow Come on it was totally mango salsa! #fakenews on the old cone  https://t.co/Aql7nnTvnq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanRather Why would they carry a bunch of lies. It’s time for news coverage to stand up and say no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeTakei Preach!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcACaputo Why is this not surprising.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maddow @ewarren @SenWarren is not up for that competition. I really like her, when she stooped  to the orange ones level she proved she is not the right candidate for this fight. Dems come together with a few that can win the fight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guarnaschelli God bless these amazing people who bring food to our table and their amazing hard work. Thank you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guarnaschelli @FoodNetwork Please put a real cooking show on! I literally learned how to cook watch the real cooking shows!! 🙏<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@delaneytarr Yes!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_SJPeace_ What the world needs now! A great hug! 😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarackObama @FoodDepository We miss you so much and your lovely family.  Happy thanksgiving!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelAvenatti No. We do not want a democratic Trump. This last election showed that if we vote this manic will not be re-elected. The women will be the ones that make the difference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarackObama @MichelleObama We miss you both so much! I miss time when I felt relaxed, hopeful and believed our country was moving in a good direction. I am now worried and wonder if we can turn this around.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcACaputo @maddow Major voting tampering!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joncoopertweets 🙏🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chelseahandler So the old saying that someone else with a gun could have prevented this is not holding up? Now what do you have? This is breaking my heart. Where are the broken hearts of the republicans, the NRA, the President of the United States? He is not the President of the UNITED states!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelSkolnik @delaneytarr But when will it be 😔 If children shot down in schools didn’t do it what will? We are the United States of mass killings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tommy_windham @Alyssa_Milano That is not even close to the reality of what really happened. Rewatch the video.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HedrickTanvi @Alyssa_Milano Just curious does it make you feel good to be do nasty. There is a way to give an opinion without attacking people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomiLahren @AustinDylan1124 Does this girl understand what a red wave is? Period much?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden It would make my life if @JoeBiden knocked on my door! I miss you and @BarackObama<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AustinDylan1124 Nothing!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenWarren @WellsFargo I worked at Wells Fargo as a teller they paid us just above poverty level pay. I got a nickel raise a nickel for an entire year. I still have stress with the pressure they put on us to sell. I had to bed family members to open accounts, credit card etc. Terrible company.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattxRed @Emma4Change Love you all! Please keep up what you are doing!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisEvans He is going to ruin our county and people are just standing by watching it. Please vote!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisEvans This is horrible I literally can not take this any more. When does it stop. His hatred towards women is unprecedented.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 Omg this is the President of the United States it gets worst everyday. This is so disrespectful it unimaginable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSNBC Omg in front of young girls.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fred_guttenberg YES!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeTakei Mitch McConnell has got to go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cameron_kasky That’s so horrible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@delaneytarr This is beyond disgusting. It makes me sad people would ever think like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanRather The GOP which is no longer and now the GTP Grand Trump Party and has sold its self and morals to Trump. What happen to family values?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichelleObama For this man to have the first thought of how this impacted his mother in law and the pride of her daughter becoming First Lady speaks volumes of the man @BarackObama is. We miss this first family so much!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichelleObama We miss you, your grace, intelligence, beauty and the amazing job you did as #FLOTUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fabletics I appreciate you getting back to me and I see the advertisement in the link. However, I am speaking about the current ad that speaks of different sizes but does not show any diversity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@djneff01 @FredTJoseph No sure gun shy should be the right phrase in this situation. Maybe you should have thought that through.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#fabletics how about you do a commercial that shows all shapes and sizes. Instead of just saying it and only show skinny models.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmileeRose @delaneytarr @bjoewolf @lauren_hoggs @amit_dadon @kirsten_jm_ @AAlhanti @John_Barnitt @sofiewhitney @Brendinid @theduff____ @AMarch4OurLives Love is love is love.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Emma4Change Yes yes yes this is what needs to happen! The false rumors the @nra are spreading are making what most Americans want harder than it should be. Common sense gun laws.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano @GovMikeHuckabee when your elected don’t you represent everyone in your state not just republicans? So why would you try to belittle those who are not republicans. Not a good look governor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChelseaClinton What about the fact the NRA convection the President attend did not allow guns. He is so hypocritical it’s unbelievable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChelseaClinton Absolutely illiterate and hateful. His own church has come out against this policy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@austindylan1111 Hey grandpa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Please please run for President. We have lost everything this country stands for with this current administration, if you can even call it that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joelmsiegel @ChelseaClinton @NY1 @Gothamist Here’s my question that does not seem to be addressed in all of this. When and how are these children going to be returned to their parents? Our government can’t keep records straight how are they going to keep track of the parents and children.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thechew @chefsymon @clinton_kelly @carlahall Don’t goooooooo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chelseahandler @BrianKarem YES!! This is what we need the press to do! Time to strp@up and stop appeasing the administration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guarnaschelli loved that butterfly shirt you had on at tonight where is it from?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidhogg111 @delaneytarr @davidhogg111 ban bump stocks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chefsymon Nooooooo. Love watching you guys. I’m sorry to hear this news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaclynCorin @Emma4Change @potus it makes me physically ill that he sat in front of those families as they cried a few months later goes to the NRA conference. @mike_pence is no better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@austindylan1111 @GreatClips Yikes! That’s a bad hair cut!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahKSilverman All he does is bully people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Susan_Hennessey Don’t always agree with McCain on a lot of issues. However he is a hero and should never be disrespected in this way. Where is the out rage?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edeweysmith @ChelseaClinton This is discussing. Parkland shooter did not go through anything like that. The injustice is ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaclynCorin @Emma4Change How about Florida having at least 3 social workers per school. Guidance counselor are trained to guide you towards a goal not mental health.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AMarch4OurLives and another active shooter at @youtube when will they wake up and change gun laws. I can’t take another report like this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bourdain wonder if you still fell the same about @TedNugent and if you regret doing the shows with him? @NeverAgainMSD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano @davidhogg111 @IngrahamAngle yesterday I was at @msdstrong helping to take down the temporary memorial that was put up after 17 people were shot in a high school. What did you do? Attack one of the survivors. Great job. How about you go volunteer your time to help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cameron_kasky @delaneytarr Stop attacking children who are making a change. The adults should have taken care of this years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidhogg111 @delaneytarr What is the matter with these so called adults attacking these young activists. Enough is Enough with this behavior.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@delaneytarr That is a ridiculous comment by the #NRA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaclynCorin @delaneytarr #MSDStrong There is a plan for the Parkland Historical Society to take the memorial down. Are you guys ready for that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/2hK9Wx3qLU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden @UDBidenInst Joe love you so much don’t lower yourself to engage with the worst president of our lifretime.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamalaHarris There are no words. 🙆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KaniJJackson We miss you!! The people should have listened!! Now here we are. Terrible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Emma4Change Marching in Parkland. We will be sending our love to you in DC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosie If President Obama did a tiny fraction of what Trump has done the country would have lost their minds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidhogg111 The amount of money that is spent every time he goes to Palm Beach is staggering.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenAtHome Must be a very long list!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattxRed @Emma4Change #neveragain God bless you children that went through this tragedy. My heart breaks for all of you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Emma4Change Please don’t be discouraged!! Keep up the good fight!! We have your back and stand with you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnn covering these #NeverAgain students giving passionate speeches @foxnews not covering one bit of it. What are they afraid of?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bourdain This argument is ridiculous. If teachers wanted to be policemen than that’s the field of work they would have gone into. They want to be teachers. There is no money in schools for pencils you think there going to train them to be sharp shooters. I’m sick of these comments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bourdain @amyschumer @Everytown @chelseahandler @ChelseaClinton Please help to spread the word about this obviously disturbed man running for Congress. How would anyone give away an AR-15 in light of what has just recently happen in my hometown?  https://t.co/nePaDb4Zlj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShaneFeldman @Rosie @AMarch4OurLives We will be there!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brianschatz @marcorubio Florida voter here! You better start looking for a new job! A monster has been woken in Florida and we are not happy with what you have to say.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DwyaneWade How does she still have a job?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheView hoping @MeghanMcCain does not show up tomorrow. I do not want to hear her and her fathers views on the @nra tomorrow. This happened in my neighborhood. My heart is broken.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bessbell Discussing!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosie As far as I have seen nothing has changed the game. Our children getting killed in an elementary school was not enough to change gun laws what is? And now we are here again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisBHaynes YES!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeffrey12099 @SleeperAthletes @MSDEagles @browardschools @NRA As usual that is the response. Of course knives, guns and bats are weapons. Think about this logically how many people can be taken down with those weapons compared to a automatic rifle? In seconds an automatic rifle can take out many human lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SleeperAthletes @MSDEagles @browardschools What is it going to take? How many children have to be killed? Why is the @NRA running our country? No one needs to have a automatic rifle. No one. If you like to hunt automatic rifles are not necessary. If you need to protect yourself you do not need a automatic rifle. Enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StonemanDouglas lawmakers express sadness over another school shooting. When will it be enough? When will gun laws change? You sadness is not enough. We need action NOW.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@votevets @will_c_fischer This is discussing. Hitler come to mind? North Korea?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jorge_guajardo @chefjoseandres @CafeMilanoDC You have got to be kidding me. He is a hero! @chefjoseandres @IvankaTrump what the hell have you done?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#metoo a man I will worked with would come in and rub my shoulders and rub his penis on my back. His wife was by boss.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheEllenShow Could they all overthrow Trump and run the country as a group and unite the US<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoodNetworkStar please do not let Matthew move forward. So arrogant and annoying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChelseaClinton This is beyond shocking. Other countries have passed us by. They speak multiple languages while we hold on to English only.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Megnaman92 my son I thought your mind was more open than this. Please read the facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Megnaman92 gonna say you need to look into it more. Transgender people are not the problem with molesting children or hurting children.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Megnaman92 when have you been in a bathroom with a transgender person? Most likely never. North Carolina got it wrong. Hate never wins.<|endoftext|>
