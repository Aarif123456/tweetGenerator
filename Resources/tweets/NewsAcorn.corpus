<|startoftext|>@latimeralder @PrincessofWails Nice to see the pic of Tony Benn. He was absolutely right about Europe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@julie_kelly2 At least there's not even a pretense of objectivity or impartial analysis here. #MSNBC simply goes all in and hires another #Obama communications officer!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mtracey Because they don't want him to succeed. It spoils the narrative and threatens the agenda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lawrence Their corporate donors and sponsors must be concerned!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mtracey Yes, in many ways, Trump has merely removed the Emperor's clothes of the American Presidency. That's one of the reasons why he's such a threat to defenders of the establishment.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Barnes_Law This is an important point. Especially compared with the massively overstaffed, overfunded #Clinton campaign, #Trump's instinctive, entrepreneurial political brilliance was and remains massively underrated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikeallen @jonathanvswan Unusually speculative analysis here based on admittedly unclear evidence re the talks and their outcome. This piece is not up to usual @axios standards, IMO.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MZHemingway I'm not sure members of the #MSM understand how offensive their mutual appreciation society can be to outsiders. Awards, book endorsements etc.  all play into this. But the often smug, patronizing, and uncritical "group think" which helps fuel it is much m ore dangerous IMO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickygervais So Hampstead is like the North Pole?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jordanbpeterson Agreed. Ideological commitments generally involve the absence of critical thinking. Free thought is a much more creative enterprise.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Olivianuzzi Looks like an actor!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeadlineWH But it looks nothing like Trump!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicolleDWallace But Trump had good reason to declare a limited srike succesfully accomplished. A very different situation from W's absurd showboating on an aircraft carrier in the midst of a costly and misguided mission for which the world is still paying.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KattyKayBBC Please don't confuse this issue with the facts!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AshleyRParker They may not have known themselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshleyRParker @Reinlwapo @PeteHegseth @SecShulkin He just loves @FoxNews, lol!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CandiceMalcolm Perhaps he needs to rest up for his next overseas fashion show! #Trudeau<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KattyKayBBC Stubbornness is an obvious explanation, but rarely identified specifically.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhilipRucker Stop the world. I want to get off! #Trump #news<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CathyYoung63 @yashar Exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ggreenwald I agree. It's also reminiscent of earlier "red" scares in American history, including, sometimes rhetorically, of McCarthyism. #Russia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BridgetPhetasy The labels are  too simplistic, Bridget. Many of us just don't fit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HallieJackson @AriMelber A remarkable interview!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottAdamsSays Diagnostically speaking, humor impairment seems a pretty predictable symptom of #TrumpDerangementSyndrome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@politico Of course, they do. The #GOP's globalist corporate donors don't want anything to interfere with business as usual.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AshleyRParker You mean "contain," I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Telegraph God help us if we are!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShannonBream And your Christian viewers love seeing the joy and clear sincerity of your faith. Thx for your testimony.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Viral_In_USA I prefer to use a shovel!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MyPetIsMyTherapist, because she's a bad listener, her vocabulary is limited and she's expensive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@conservmillen I wouldn't encourage any further communications.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikeallen Thx so much for this vital dose of reality. Most of these stories are little more than gossip, IMO. But they help foster a "gathering storm" narrative which is only helpful to Trump's many critics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McCormickProf He's bound to be a strong candidate at some point, I would have thought, though in Trump's GOP, not any time soon. Probably the brightest person in the Senate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewCMcCarthy @WSJopinion So a manifestly failed  policy is better than trying a new strategy? Fascinating to watch the defenders of globalist, as well as neocon, orthodoxy striving to defend the indefensible. #tariffs #TradeWar #China<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Olympics_Newz Good, because I'm also quite comfortable missing the #NHL . #Olympics2018<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobSchneider Probably, because that allegation is unproven and almost certainly irrelevant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeadlineWH @DanEggenWPost @esglaude @NicolleDWallace Great show again today. Thx. "Theater of the absurd" is a term strikes me nearly every day as I think about this White House.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chrislhayes More like Justin's "excellent adventure"! #TrudeauInIndia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SylvaticusRex @sullydish Agreed. And it's well worth taking the time on such a vital topic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you're paying too much attention to your #Twitter and #SocialMedia follower counts . . .  https://t.co/uic7wKiHRe<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jheil The whole idea of arming teachers is a nonsensical abrogation of responsibility by those actually charged to keep their citizens safe. It's also a coward's refuge for politicians  who refuse to engage substantive #GunControl measures for fear of losing #NRA support.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mtracey I didn't.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Cernovich I predict that Russian #Bots  will be responsible for everything under the sun by the time the #MSM are through with this madness! #TrumpRussia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theintercept @ggreenwald The other political pressure point here, of course, is that the greater the hype, the greater the charge against #Trump for being an AWOL CiC in the necessary retaliation against #Russia 's "act of war."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet I also have "a bitter, aching regret" that I haven't seen a single Harry Potter movie. Then again, perhaps not!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JessicaLexicus Amazing colors!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNNPolitics And in other news, political scientists also ranked #Trump the worst Presidential candidate in history in 2016! #CNN #FakeNewsMedia<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jheil Let's blame everything on the Russians, while we're at it. Life's much simpler that way!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jonathanvswan Another great report.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aleksic @InklessPW Depends on the schools, the teachers, the programmes, and the parents, who also have a major role to play. The High School IB curriculum, for example, lays strong emphasis on kids thinking for themselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amber_athey @Cernovich In this case, yes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JesseLehrich @DarknessRandom It's amazing how crazy and offensive such coverage is, both from @CNN and @washingtonpost #FakeNews indeed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@axios Thx for reminding us of this. It's tended to get lost in all the  #media BS about the "Ivanka of the North." #NorthKorea<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ggreenwald @davidfrum But neocons are now supposed to be above reproach, as long as they're never-Trumpers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Telegraph Not like Robert Powell in "Jesus of Nazareth"! #Jesus #LikeNoOther #Movies_TV<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thehill So kids will be denied the opportunity to study two of the best works of American literature in class because they include offensive words and address problematic issues of race which many of those same kids encounter every day outside school. #Education #US<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@agearan He cares. He really cares . . . for the abusers. #abused #WhiteHouseWifeBeaters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lis_Smith I once thought about it, whereupon I decided against it. #Tweets #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InklessPW Agreed. State schools are much underrated in Canada. The PC bias is there, as it is in pretty much every public institution, but kids can still get a good education, especially if they're encouraged to think for themselves. #Education #Canada<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AP_Politics So how long will it take the #Democrats to leak the second #Fisa memo? #MemoGate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhilipRucker @eliseviebeck If all the abusers resigned together, I wonder how many would be left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHSommers But we do know from old British war movies that the French resistance all wore black berets and striped shirts, lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshleyRParker @CarolLeonnig @shaneharris @GregJaffe As long as he gets the info, whatever works, I guess. But I have a better idea. Get it recorded every day and have someone deliver it from a "Fox and Friends"-like TV set! #DailyBriefing #Trump<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AprilLaJune @Kuvidob The #MSM's hatred of #Trump and his agenda seems to blind many journalists to anything else. #TrumpDerangementSyndrome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@varepall Of course, it doesn't. In this case, the #FBIandDOJ leaders were much more worried about protecting themselves than #NationalSecurity . #MemoDay<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JimGimini @NRO @RichLowry 3), #Trump's statement at the Florida press conference was entirely consistent with his flamboyant, provocative, and often humorous campaign rhetoric generally. It provides no evidence of "collusion." 3/3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimGimini @NRO @RichLowry 2), Junior's stated openness to discuss getting opposition research through a dubious Russian source is no proof that such research was ever received.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimGimini @NRO @RichLowry All this alleged "evidence" is circumstantial, non-conclusive, and open to multiple interpretations. For example, 1), the change in the #GOP platform was consistent with a widely expressed desire to pursue better relations with #Russia. 1/2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>More  #TrumpDerangementSyndrome hyperbole and nonsense. If #Democrats like @RepGregoryMeeks really were "in an atmosphere of a foreign government that's totalitarian," they wouldn't even be able to declare their dissent. #stablegenius  https://t.co/rcWcSMHWFt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews @SenSanders @realDonaldTrump I have a suggestion. Approve the #BorderWall funding and you'll get #DACA, It's called politics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CassandraRules "Cult" and "scam" sound like better descriptions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaketapper @brianstelter @cnni Agreed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidfrum There are also millions who believe that @realDonaldTrump is totally fit for office and that most of the hand-wringing about "unfitness" is a part of a political campaign to oust him from office! #TrumpDerangementSyndrome #stablegenius<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I guess if @realDonaldTrump doesn't point out his obvious succeses, few others will, at least in the #MSM. A classic case of "if you don't blow your own trumpet..." - except @FoxNews and fawning #Cabinet. #TrumpDerangementSyndrome  https://t.co/ajCKY1aamC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Cernovich Now they're trying to oust a duly elected President. So anything goes - #Russia #25thAmendment #Impeachment !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NateSilver538 @maggieNYT May I respectfully suggest that all those who don't like the interviewing techniques of  reporters  who get to speak to #Trump apply their brilliant ideas to their own next interviews? I'm sure we'd all benefit from the results, as well as the wisdom, of their 20/20 hindsight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ggreenwald There's also, of course, a profitable niche market for "respectable," Republican #NeverTrumpers  on progressive talk shows etc.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@InklessPW Is there a petition we can sign?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenniferJJacobs But what we really want is another report from #Trump's own doctor. Are the results still "outstandingly excellent"? And he is still "the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency”?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaketapper @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Probably the part he saw on TV!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DeadlineWH @DavidJollyFL @NicolleDWallace Much that passes as "political gamesmanship" in Washington would be considered childish in most other walks of life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KattyKayBBC The stream of consciousness @POTUS. At least, he was thinking about his wife!<|endoftext|>
