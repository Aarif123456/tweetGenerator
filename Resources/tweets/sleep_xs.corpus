<|startoftext|>@nypost Of course they’ll say it’s fiction because they know the show somewhat connects the dots and the show kind of decorated the idea and possibility that the royal family might have killed dianna. think about it, why would the uk government deny the show only on the last season?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The left is not voting for Biden, they’re voting for not Trump. That’s fucking scary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spectatorindex It’s not even a debate anymore and 2 minutes is not enough. How is it a debate if you can’t actually debate. It takes 2 minutes to answer the question but candidates also need extra time to respond to jabs thrown from the other candidate on other things<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamalaHarris This is the creepiest and scariest Gif<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElSympathico @KlagsbrunTO @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris The communist dictator who’s killed millions of innocent people is more trustworthy than US....ok bud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Worse. And this might start a chain effect on other international countries. There are some new shows and movies out about uprising and revolution, all depicting the elections. I think either these movies know what’s coming or it’s a bigger message to send to viewers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here me out.. I feel like there are a lot of signs in 2020 that’s saying there are dark times ahead of us... I feel like it all starts with US elections as well as COVID.

<|startoftext|>@HarderPray @SecPompeo @USNavy Trump is the only person that can scare away foreign powers. You have Biden on the other selling out to China and Ukraine, and he will sellout to Iran as soon as he’s president too. Your hate for the trump is clouding your judgement<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hey #FBI where are the raids in the middle of the night like you do to republicans and conservatives. FBI has has the info on Hunter/Biden story and hasn’t done anything.

<|startoftext|>@murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump You’re literally supporting the most corrupt politician to date.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump “Even if the emails were real” unreal statement. Ok so is it fake or is it real now? Make up your mind. and have you seen the emails? How do you know Joe Biden does not correlate with the emails?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People don’t even know why they are voting anymore, they hate trump so much because of how he got there, that they would rather put the most corrupt politician up there as president.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump Since when has Twitter and Facebook taken down Russian disinformation before, you’re delusional. And why would they release the emails and data rn? so the left can deny it even more and have a story for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CartoonsExist @RaheemKassam How is it debunked? Just cause Facebook and Twitter took it down, it does not make it debunked..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think that if Trump wins the election, civil war will ensue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@akamoderate @RichardGrenell @JoeBiden Media and social media are running a monopoly, these democrats are so corrupt that topic on hunter/Biden and Ukraine has been swept under the rug. These poor people are being brainwashed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bHonestOk @RichardGrenell @JoeBiden Who do you think is in control of the puppet Joe Biden? It’s Obama and Killary. If wasnt for them two, Joe would’t have even come close to the presidency<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People need to wake up, Joe Biden alongside Obama do not care about the common people, we are just leverage for them to make money and do whatever they want. Joe Biden will SELLOUT to China and Iran once again!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>you have Facebook and Twitter censoring articles because it doesn’t fit their own liberal agenda or are possibly scared of the Democrats for their policies, this is a big problem. And these companies along with Amazon run a monopoly with the mainstream media. This is not fair!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you have companies like Facebook and Twitter censoring articles for “disinformation” for something they never even fact-checked, who are puppets of the Democrats, that should make you think the real corrupt politicians are the Democrats, not Trump..........<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ddlovato Once again celebrities prove they are the most dumb humans on earth...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It was predicted that by the 1990s a half-dozen large corporations will own all the most powerful media outlets in the United States.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fortunately, no single corporation controls all the mass media in the United States. something is happening that points in that direction. If mergers and acquisitions by large corporations continue at the present rate, one massive firm will be in virtual control of all majormedia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have entered a new age of fake news media, and these guys control every media and will get their agenda across and claim trump is evil or telling lies. Do not trust the media or Facebook or Jeff bezos....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The story about Joe Biden and his son’s relationship with Ukraine is real, it’s not fake because Facebook and other media’s are taking those down.That doesn’t make it fake.

<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Your party is the one causing all the problems and all the riots what are you on about, it’s no longer about George Floyd or Breonna Taylor, it’s about ruining cities until you get what you want. Antifa is not an idea.<|endoftext|>
