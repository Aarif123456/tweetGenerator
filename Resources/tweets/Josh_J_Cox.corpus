<|startoftext|>@MsMylesbmurray You look gorgeous hunni ♥️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TehMimi I feel this right now 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@randi_savage Everyone keeps on telling me to get into the Christmas spirit and then I look online and see all the drama and I am like nope, vlogmas should be renamed drama-mas every year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Broda_Boy Awwwww this an adorable pic 🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Come on now guys this has been going on 4 a while now. @glow_smokey was just trying 2 do the right thing &amp; @angelikaoles has now apologised in her latest video. I like them both &amp; it's hard 2 watch all this back &amp; forth &amp; hate go down. It has 2 come 2 end at some point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GidgetRussell2 @TruthSleuthYT Yep<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>💚<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vegimitesucks @glow_smokey @angelikaoles I don't know who deji is sorry, at the end of the day from what I could see she was trying, all she can do is try, whether people accept that it's up to them. I cant speak for people. All I can say is the arguing online doesn't look good for either of them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@author_ninja @iamKeenie @glow_smokey @angelikaoles It was very clear in her video that she was very upset over everything that has happened and I hope in time people can forgive her and I hope her and smokey can work things out as I am fan of them both<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vegimitesucks @glow_smokey @angelikaoles She has apologised for it though in her latest video. I feel like she did hold herself accountable in that video she was almost in tears. I was just trying to be mediator cos I do like both creators and don't want to see them in a dispute<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReadytoglareYT I do love this lip colour, I hope your taking care of yourself in these trying times<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vegimitesucks @glow_smokey @angelikaoles I am sorry I am confused as to how I said calling continued micro aggression towards BIPOC a "mistake". I don't believe I ever said that. It wasn't my intention at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glow_smokey @angelikaoles I think in situations like this it's so difficult coz one side has their own version of how it has made them feel and so does the other. I like them both so seeing all this is unfold and get blown out of control due to others is just so heart breaking to watch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReadytoglareYT Hey and yep I feel you on that, depression sucks.  https://t.co/hofyZge20W<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glow_smokey @angelikaoles Hey, I know I am technically nobody in regards to anything, however, I think this is getting blown out of control. I understand @angelikaoles made some mistakes but it seems she has tried to make amends now. You both are fabulous and this arguing won't get anywhere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was nearly in tears myself here and honestly I don't know what to do coz I love Hannah and I love Angelika. I hate the internet at times. There is so much I want to say on the disability side of things and I had no idea about the accusations of transphobic stuff<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Hang on an adult is crying over an app that is mostly used by kids/ teen-agers and to top it off he is asking for help off a teenager. How can she help? I mean seriously he has been at this social media game for years. Maybe he shouldn't be a dick online in the first place<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharlesNotJoe @glow_smokey 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glow_smokey I have it queued up. I think my life is just YouTube videos lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love this. Go forth and me magical people 🏳️‍🌈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Have I missed something yet again?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jessismiles__ Oh wow congrats 😁 I am so happy for you hunni ♥️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always remember you can make mistakes. It's how you handle those mistakes that make a difference<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FKA_Wigs_ No problem you look great ♥️ 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikaelaSchmit @Margolndigo Seriously y after everything she has done to other ppl she is going to play the mh card are u F-ing kidding me. So what backlash is she facing now then coz I doubt it's a mh issue. A lot of ppl like her like to use mh when it's just backlash. Take accountability would be a start<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@natashartistry No prob you have amazing looks hunni ♥️😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is absolutely stunning ♥️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Oooooh that's a gorgeous view<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Men can wear skirts ♥️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FKA_Wigs_ You do look cute. Not many men can pull of skirts but you have managed it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MannyMua733 I'm nice, in small doses lol or so I am told haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT I wonder if he will ever address anything lol I had one of this followers telling me that all we do is harrass and bulky him. They didn't like it when I had things to say back though lol I am getting bored of this 30 yr old+ man acting like a child.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Margolndigo I'm going to lose my shit, who the f is using mental health as an escape yet again? Sorry if I am butting my head in but this gets right on my nerves more than anything else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Sorry for longish talk then<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey I watched the women's video and it seemed more of a drag at the Kardashians and then angelica came in to. I can't see her apology to it all or how it all blew up. It sounded bad so I was disappointed but I do love agelica and Hannah and I hope they can sort it out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It saddens my heart when I see people who have lost their lives or who are struggling like this. I know these are only words but know that no matter what you are loved and deserve to be here. If you ever need anyone to talk to my DMs are always open. Never struggle alone 💚<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@depressionnote 💚<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackeeHarry 😂😂😂😂😂 yep<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That depends on the game lol some people have been trying to get me in to call of duty and that game stresses me out haha but other wise yeah I agree<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very true. So many people are sexy on the eye but the soul attached is ugly and that's where I am like nope not doing it. Personality is Key for me for every aspect of my life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glow_smokey I'm actually sat watching one of your yes or pass videos lol I will have to watch this one afterwards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MongrelAdam Crashed and burned<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey When does not go off. It's her stick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReadytoglareYT Loving it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MongrelAdam You seem a bit lit up 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I mean there was Thatcher but she was also Tory and destroyed the country too sooooo.  This is what the country wanted and this is what they got.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I find the estimated date on this so funny lol ps it's the @glow_smokey PR box. I don't think I will get on Christmas day some how 🤣🤣  https://t.co/oExp5hChbd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glow_smokey I had no idea this happened and I have been watching her beauty videos all day. I have just watched Diana's video and I can fully understand why she is disappointed. I am shocked as I thought she was so very self aware.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT This is going to be one hell of a long video then lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angelikaoles I think you have me addicted to Beauty Bay now 🤣 the bank account might hate me soon 😂. Ps I am sat here watching all your beauty videos you look amazing. Wish I looked that good when I did make up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT I have a question about the lawsuits but I don't know if to do it in video formats or just on here coz I have a lot to say on other topics too but I feel like the other stuff might be too old now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haha love it 🤣🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@glow_smokey Pets don't get enough credit for what they do for us. My little kitty is my princess. She has attitude that I am like "yep that's my Morgana, she was raised right 😂"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just want to tell you all that no matter what you are loved and that even in the darkest hours there is a light at the end of it.   If you ever need someone to talk my DMs are always open and I am always here. We need to help each other and care for each other.  https://t.co/ytP9ahDFyZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too true. I don't have many friends coz I can't handle the drama it brings but the friends I do have are my family<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angelikaoles I actually have a BH cosmetics pallette that I got from TKmaxx lol I do love it. Also W7 is another good one that you can cheep from BandM guys. I have spent loads on make up and I have only done two looks haha 😂 I am not at all good at make up but hey it's interesting to me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Just_Because955 @kattenbarge There is a difference between bullying/ bullying &amp; wanting answers. The man is an influencer so he has infleunce over people &amp; his actions have consequences that he needs 2 own up 2. He can block me &amp; block others all day long. Doesn't change the fact he has some explaing to do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Just_Because955 @kattenbarge But you commented a response instead. Interesting how he couldn't do that 😂 all people want is for him to answer for his actions but nope he blocks and tries to silence people sooooo interesting that's the response.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glow_smokey @allegedly_adam I am interested in one. I know it's a way someone plans, like some people make lists, others leave sticky notes things. Is it like that kinda of thing. Like using pictures to visualise your dreams/ ambitions in to real life actions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT Does this mean I can find his make up down at my local bargain madness (B&amp;M), do they have them America we do here in the UK, for £4.50 (6.02 dollers) lol now that his fame is literally imploding. It wouldn't surprise me after all this serious stuff is coming out about him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kattenbarge I like that I have gone off at Jeffree on here b4 &amp; it's stuff he has actually done, like there was tweets of him saying the stuff. But I went off at him over this situation, which I know is alleged, but Idc I still gave him what for &amp; now I get blocked. Interesting 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well he has signed sealed and delivered his fate this time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thisispanos Cake looks amazing and you don't have to lose any weight. If they are going to picky about that then they ain't worth it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glow_smokey No one said they was smart. Maybe when grow up and realise the world doesn't revolve around them and their circle of clones they might (slim chance) start making better life style choices. You know be life style influencers. 😱 It's like it's their job or something<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DearMrAtheist Anti-vaxxers &gt; Anti- braincells. What's the difference these days?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm 💀😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@allegedlyangelo Well 😂😂😂 you know he would try it haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh dear I got blocked 😂  What's the matter #jeffreestar can't you stand the truth?  You may not like what us adults have to say but one day soon karma will come. You may have the kids/teens brainwashed but we ain't. Own your shit Jeffree!  https://t.co/xsvCB1cj69<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>👀👀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know you have the potential to be anything you want to be. You may have limits but you can work those limits to do anything. Never let anyone stop you from achieving those dreams you have. #success #BeYourself #goals #dream #acheive #potential  https://t.co/MhDlsG02Ya<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So is @JeffreeStar over yet? I saw him trying to sell his mystery boxes right in the middle of "scandal" again. When will the J* stans wake up. The alien used his fame to silence a RAPE VICTIM!!!  Do you want me to spell this out for you kids. He is just as guilty if not worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's help him out guys!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ReadytoglareYT @creepshow_art Wow so the meeting was that impactful it caused all this? Now we know who to blame lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT @TheEmilyDBaker @DramaEsq I am drinking this weekend so.... Game on lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT Lol she thinks that's a bomb. Ok sure Jan. She doesn't realise that with evidence against that's just going to be thrown straight out of court. Excellent bomb Katie just excellent. Now show me how your going try and silence someone else..... Again! Coz ur threats are working. Not<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hotmessexpressx @ThreeDailey Well yeah your right there. All they think about is money money money. But there has to come a point where someone steps in and says that these things ain't a good idea at all no matter how much money they want. Ethics must come first<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kinda___tired @wikimiki0303 @glow_smokey Sorry I didn't see this tweet till just yeah basically that's what she did. I can't believe it myself. She then tried to play dumb as if it's nothing serious. I sometimes wonder about the mentality of the influencers now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glow_smokey Ooooh I can't wait to watch hunni ♥️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Oooooh interesting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glow_smokey Good. She needed her account taken off her. I am still trying to wrap my brain around why she did it. What have her the idea. I know I am a total moron at times and I have some crazy ideas. But I don't even come close to this. No where near. What gave her the idea<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey This situation actually makes me feel so sick. I don't know what was going through her head that made her think this was a good idea.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Omg I am 💀 😂 you nailed it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dconama Sex and the city is a classic and I have watched it a few times and the movies too. Yeah people call me sad and I say I don't care lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glow_smokey You never have to apologise for making two videos in a day hunni, you speak from your heart and that's what counts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT I know I am supposed to be shocked by the news but I am not. At this point problematic people stick to other problematic people like glue. Sigh what's going to come next I wonder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glow_smokey I was on a total rant with my fiance the other day about influencer's not doing there job. They choose the word "influencer" when it suites them and its really starting to get right on my nerves. Don't want influence right well then don't. Don't get the "fame" from it either then<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Congrats 👏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT Sorry that was a total rant moment it just grates on my gears and I couldn't hold it in anymore. Why do they do it. It's setting all the people who do suffer back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT Who is actually suffering and who suffers day in day out from mental health issues they don't have any control over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT It's people like this who are using it when they know full well they don't suffer, they may be having a hard time right now. Boo fucking hoo sweet heart. They made the mess now they have to lye in it. They don't get to use mental health as a prop coz it under cuts everyone else-<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT I am starting to get really pissed off with certain YouTubers using the "mental health" card to get out of scandal. No they created the shit they are in. As someone who suffers daily and has had to fight to be acknowledged. This is why I got ignored for so many years.......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have been through @woacbofficial tweets &amp; I have seen her videos &amp; I have this 2 say. Girl get off the internet. Ur not doing urself any favours. U have tried to silence other creators for so long &amp; found out it doesn't work. It's time u left hunni. U made this issue no1 else!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you fucking kidding me. The moron has really done this and then tweeted this crap. Well Lawrence I hope to god you never use the NHS coz you don't deserve it you miserable excuse for a human<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheEmilyDBaker Congrats 👏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hows everyone's day going?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey @PaigeChristieUK Congrats to @PaigeChristieUK  it looks stunning. I wish I get it but I just brought some make up and I think to keep my house hold happy I shouldn't buy any more just yet. I'll add it to me basket of "need to buy" for when I can lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheEmilyDBaker Is it unlawful to creat accounts to help you reach this mark 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheEmilyDBaker @creepshow_art @TruthSleuthYT @queenmagdarl @TeamYouTube Oh we all know exactly why she is doing it. To appeal people need to give their full name, address and phone number. It's perfect for a woman who has been accused of doxxing people. The issue she is facing is. We all know how it works so people won't fall for it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AiryiiJane @ThePerezHilton @Margolndigo @SeBrockStar @itsNICKSNIDER @ThreeDailey And at those points therapy can help a lot to an adult who has a childhood like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AiryiiJane @ThePerezHilton @Margolndigo @SeBrockStar @itsNICKSNIDER @ThreeDailey The good thing about children is. They grow up and make their own decisions. Everyone grows to find their own feet no matter what our parents try imprint to us<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThePerezHilton @lumi_1004 @Margolndigo @SeBrockStar @itsNICKSNIDER @ThreeDailey That would be called no attention, how do you think you get to that point? By having the Bad/ negative attention that's how you become ignored and forgotten. One day you will find out how all this bad attention will actually come back to bite you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey I don't see what the issue is. I have got used to it pretty quickly but then again I am not a social media star so I wouldn't know lol I just post random crap on there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThePerezHilton @lumi_1004 @Margolndigo @SeBrockStar @itsNICKSNIDER @ThreeDailey Not all attention is good attention and one day Karna will come back at you. Look what's happening to Jeffree Star right now. Trisha admits she is a troll on the internet and she isn't very well liked on the internet either from what I see. You sure want go down this road?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThePerezHilton @Margolndigo @SeBrockStar @itsNICKSNIDER @ThreeDailey Does the hurting of others and the attention keep you happy? Will it be there for you? These are the questions you have to ask because one day you will need support and if you keep on this road you won't have it. Life is short my friend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThePerezHilton @Margolndigo @itsNICKSNIDER Sorry I don't use tiktok much and I am currently listening to an audio book so what are you trying to point out in the tiktok that will counter what I have said beings as it's under the tweet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT You guys are killing me off with all this stuff 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is exactly my level of maturity lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MileyCyrus I'm am idiot I thought this said  https://t.co/5IWpO8wVJF not  https://t.co/Ir6FqaNt6N lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yorkiepud76 And you manage to look good doing it. I am in the category often and look like a total mess lol so props to you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't wait to play with the things in here. @glow_smokey has some amazing things and it's the very first thing I have brought from abroad and also first thing I have brought from an influencer too. You never know I could be MUA you never know lol. I'm itching to have them.  https://t.co/mBYlgHlETw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glow_smokey @MidasCosmetics The first time I have ever ordered anything from abroad, I'm from the UK, and the first time I have brought influencer and I am happy to say I just did and it's support to smokey glow 😁👍 I got the PR package and can't wait to have it in my hands<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThePerezHilton @Margolndigo @itsNICKSNIDER It's not a contest Perez and remember those who try to out do someone looks even worse. Even if you do make more (which I am pretty sure you don't actually know) it looks like your just trying devalue someones life, this in turn makes you look like the bad guy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheEmilyDBaker @itsNICKSNIDER Facts are facts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cute 🐱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThePerezHilton @Margolndigo @SeBrockStar @itsNICKSNIDER @ThreeDailey Perez you do realize that by trying to make a point by calling someone a 'lying junkie' isn't the best way to get it across right? It's just going to piss people off even more. Ps I bet your life isnt perfect so don't sit there and judge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER You sure your not just passing gas 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT Oh sweet Jesus she never stops does she. I have just looked through your tweets. I am sorry you are going through all this. She needs to be stopped<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT Oh what's she done now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bainser Interesting isn't it. It's almost like that was the whole point of Brexit doesn't it lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning all ☀️  How are you all doing?

<|startoftext|>Oooooh she real mad lol. Hang didnt the same people tell everyone four years ago to shut up and accept the vote? Funny how when it doesn't go their way they want to make all the noise now. Well guess what now it's your turn shut up and accept the vote cry babies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angelikaoles I am not allowed to watch in my house anymore 😂 I wonder if the reboot will be any good when it comes out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amen!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT Still? Wow she must be bored. I know as someone who is the same age range as her I don't have the patience to keep it going 4 days in a row. It's sad when you think about it. She must not have a lot going on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Olysibley That's nothing my friend you should see my rats nest I call hair lol at least you can style yours. You look fab by the way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope I don't think they will. They won't get it right the virus has driven the country to the point of no return. But you know they know more than the experts do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JJDodders How about is an attractive man. How about that? This whole body labeling creates body image issues and body shaming IMO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bainser @ScotCuthbertson @BBCNews Yeah but I have never understood why a group of people who scream for acceptance then tell another group that they don't accept them. It's setting the community back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScotCuthbertson @bainser @BBCNews I am not shocked by the BBC that they would do this. My question why is this LGB Alliance group still going. They are making a mockery of what the LGBTQIA+ community stands for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@profiterholes I thought being a bear was a good thing though. I mean I don't buy into body labels but the original tweet calling Adam a bear was meant a compliment so I don't get why the guy saw it as calling him fat and went on a rant about bullying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT I hope he does too. I have to admit James isn't my cup of tea and last year I went hard on him too. Which I feel awful for. But what they these people are doing isn't right. I feel for him. He is young and I did all kinds of crazy shit at his age . They should know better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This coming from the woman who has offended everyone for years. The woman who is the biggest troll on the internet 🤣🤣🤣 get real Trisha! You have no room to talk with the shit you have done. Why are you going after James? You jealous that he is younger and more successful?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT Seriously why is going for James so hard. Hummmm what's being said to her behind the scenes I wonder. Jeffree did it last year and now Trisha this year. My question is why James? What's he done to them? Is it because he is more younger and more popular I wonder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bencstweet Nice hair and interesting tattoos<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Bitch lol how dare you manage to do that lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robcog1992 Every single time lol I always say I am going to have ten minute shower ( I am not one for baths) and I am in there for ages lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT Ok you have me interested, you going to spill or keep us in suspense lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I need a moment too! 👀👀👀 Damn he is looking hot 🔥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Miley does look fab but I know what what's happening here lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteHolderness Carlisle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1ndieGates_ And that's brilliant because having it resolved one way could resolve the other way. Hopefully it will all stop now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1ndieGates_ Awesome 👍 great to see things can be done<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MongrelAdam No but sounds like an interesting skill lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How the hell is this shit legal. From what I can tell he managed to get out due to getting people to give him money for his bail. Like really this crap is legal? After killing people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1ndieGates_ @Twitter @TwitterSupport I have seen on twitter for many years Dan and I have never seen you get in to any trouble at all. I have, however, seen many others been very problematic on this platform and they get answers. So I am a little annoyed with how it's not being handled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1ndieGates_ I'll retweet you mate. People like this need to be held accountable for their actions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't be silly because that means they would be doing their job then. Instead they would rather protect one of their own and the responses make them look even worse. The revolt is coming, the people will rise eventually and that's going to be day of reckoning for them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The logic 🤣🤣 makes you wonder doesn't it 🌈🌈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glow_smokey I saw this unfold, in the early hours here in the UK. As someone who is on the spectrum I am annoyed at this because why couldn't she cast actors who represent the roles. It happens all to often that people with disabilities get pushed aside and enough is enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1ndieGates_ I am not surprised that the platform isn't doing anything. They should but it hallens way to often. Unless you are a "celeb" they ain't going to pay attention. It's happens across all platforms. If it's something you feel you need to do then go for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glow_smokey That's brilliant news 😁 I am so pleased for you hunni 👍❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT I love that argument of "danceing to an old sound byte while not even contextualising it properly". First off Tisha does it too, secondly that's the whole point of tictok. Sooooo..... That argument has no merit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Touyarokii Ps I have loads it's hard to pick just one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Touyarokii The first bird Pokémon you was ever able to catch and I mean ever!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT Drugs, not medicated properly, he secretly a vampire and need of blood? Or just hadnt his morning coffee yet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watch out people. The drama queen himself has now inserted himself so you know it's about to get good. Get your popcorn and drinks ready coz shits about to go down.  Ps Jeffree your statement contradicts itself. You scream your not bothered but then why make s video?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bainser True and from what I have seen she doesn't have any. Although working in the Tory party I think the no emotions things is part of the job<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT I said this in previous tweet. I'll just be sitting here with my pop corn and vodka waiting for it all explode again coz you know once the drama queen himself is involved that's it. All hell has broken loose. Does that make him thee devil of drama lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We must always remember the lives lost ☹️ We must also stand up and protect the rights of our trans community.  We must show support, love and compassion to the trans community during these trying times.  We stand with you!  #TransDayofRememberance #TransRightsAreHumanRights<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bainser I don't see any but dam that one must cut deep if she saw it lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ouch 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT It's Jeffree did you expect anything different?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MelDMann First of all I want to know how they covering themselves in blood especially Jesus blood coz that shit got to be old so eeewww and so no sanitary secondly they can do what they like natural selection will sort out the rest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spillseshYT Oh for god sake who woke the dragon up.  Jeffree darling your not in most people's head let alone their mouths I am sure. Of course the drama queen himself had to pop off. Here we go again! You will find me at the back with pop corn and vodka lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1backwoodsbarbi I like your take on it. Your right she does need to held accountable it does look like she will be though. Well that's my hope anyways.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dam I feel so old lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trishapaytas I would just quit while your ahead girl because as you can probably tell by the backlash this isn't getting the outcome you want. Id just stop! Is it worth it for a bit of attention? I mean really<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Join me in following this newsletter? 👀   https://t.co/DItFFj7TXu via @revue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It can still be retrieved, all the lawyer's have to do is contact the services to get that information. I would love to know your thoughts guys? @TheEmilyDBaker @ThreeDailey @itsNICKSNIDER @TruthSleuthYT @angelikaoles (tag others as would love their opinions too)  https://t.co/x9dlULnUpN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Facebook keeps all your data, that's picture, messages, posts and videos up on their servers for at least 90s days if you delete your channel/ content. I am willing to bet that places like YouTube and Twitter do the exact same thing. So even though Katie deleted the evidence.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I have been keeping my on eye on the Tati and WOACB lawsuits. What I find interesting is that Katie deleted a lot of tweets and videos from her YouTube channel. Now I can't remember where I heard this but I am pretty sure it was on a YouTube video a while back but.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT I totally forgot he was bringing stuff out lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_emmactidxo This made me laugh and the replies are epic too 🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This 👀👀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me too hunni me too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT I know I have seen pictures and I want 😍 I am not allowed to buy anymore make up though lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT Feels that way with all the stuff going on and coming out. It's kinda worrying for the YouTube community through as this could set a bad light.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT Was a great video and interesting that he would go into someone’s DMs. Stuff is going to go down again isn’t it. This isn’t going to end anytime soon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok wow I never thought I would say this but he isn't wrong at all here. I totally agree with him 100%. Go off @jamescharles kick some ass 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robcog1992 Just the rest of the week to go 👍👏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You also didn’t do the first publicly “marriage” I think Britney Spears had you beat there. So I think your content is stolen through out your so called career judging by the comments. But you know. Whatever. Go off like you invented social media or something<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Welcome back 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Delboy1978 It's the correct answer lol it's November<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey @creepshow_art Omg that list of names 🤣🤣 you guys are dangerous when you get together haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@allegedlyangelo The shade of it all lol 😂😂  https://t.co/VQaXcPg3Ov<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey everyone. How is your #sunday going? 👍  Hope your all having a good day 😁  #SundayMotivation #sundayafternoon #sundaymood❤️ #sundaypost #sundayevening #SundayThoughts #sundayvibes #SundayFunday  https://t.co/Ldi7tEVn6B<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotAntherDrama @woacbofficial I will nevee understand why she did it while having a lawsuit herself but also how the hell did she manage to get the information in the first place that's another question I have. The loops she must have gone through. That's not ehrical journalism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReadytoglareYT @NotAntherDrama @woacbofficial Luluemon is swear this is a Digimon reference lol or am I just sad geek haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pringster78 Looking good Matt 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would like to wish @ThreeDailey a very happy birthday. I hope have a good one 🎉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glow_smokey Amazing work as always. I guess you don't really know someone until the cracks start to show huh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT Ooooh i have a feeling that this video is going to be a rant one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't have 1k followers but I am close though lol been on the 800 mark for like 2 years haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beverly_shills @TruthSleuthYT @KEEMSTAR @creepshow_art Sorry all that ran through my head reading this was Uni Minion, can you imagine those cute little creatures in little kick ass Uni uniforms lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT @KEEMSTAR @creepshow_art Tati is suing her and now I think CSA is well with in her rights to do the same. She needs to just stop now. She needs to take a step back and start to build a defence for what's about to come her way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT @KEEMSTAR @creepshow_art Omg WOACB is going after CSA. I think Katie needs to a break off social media. She claims to be a journalist but this isn't how you do it. I have looked up what it takes to be a journalist and they have a code (not that many of them follow it) she is playing with fire. I mean....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT @KEEMSTAR @creepshow_art Have I missed something?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReadytoglareYT Omg I'm crying 🤣🤣🤣 you guys nailed it haha.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking forward to this one 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glow_smokey Oh yes I would love to see you cover Tati's channel and content. You go into such detail in your videos<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benyahr I meant to say be looks better in the pic on the right lol it's 12am and I am tired lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benyahr The bad thing is he looks better in the picture on the left lol lesson here is fuck the fake tan and dying your hair to hide the greys coz my god the change is weird lol I mean it's trump so it's not really an improvement but you know lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RawBeautyKristi Oh this statement is so true for me too. I moved 2 years ago literally up the country (UK so not that big compared to us) but my god I only had a week to move and it was stressful. I feel your pain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glow_smokey Why are you anxious? Your glowmas videos, from what I can tell, always seem to do well and are always uplifting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You go girl! So pleased for ya xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glow_smokey Yay 👍 I am so pleased for you hunni. Your giving me hope to maybe start going back to my channel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReadytoglareYT I have had it the update for days. It's what I get for being a beta tester lol but I don't see what the issue is that everyone is having. It's just changed it up as far as I can see. But then again I don't look into every little change lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg seriously lol 😂😂😂 I am crying with laughter, although I think the Trump cult followers will be crying for a different reason as will he. @realDonaldTrump just face it you lost (oh you might want to prepare a legal defence cos those crimes will come back to haunt you now)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pringster78 That's s good point but it shows how corrupt it all is because the others were made too but the Tories can do what ever they like? God knows why people keep on voting them back in for. They have destroyed this country<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarboMusic That's a very heart warming statement<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pringster78 Totally agree. Look at all the others at the time who were made to resign but he managed to stay on with out even a punishment for what he did. Just goes to show you the Tory government is corrupt inside and out. They all are but Tory is the worst<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnharris1969 Brexit is and always has been a way for the government to hide their money off shore. That was the point in it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slhutch1980 Good times good times 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This needs to happen. I am sick of these huge businesses getting away with tax avoidance and also most government officials are too. They need to be dragged across the coals and been made to pay ASAP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachelparris Thank you I have been on a rage about this for last few months. I think I am driving my boyfriend nuts with it lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's moments like this that makes me feel like I want to bring back my YouTube channel but I feel disheartened. Who wants to see a fat gay guy who has issues speaking due to mental health problems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spillseshYT Congrats 🎉. Keep spilling that boiling hot 🔥 tea 🍵<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Just keeping you Dan. Ignore the haters. I enjoy your tweets and your always a delight to talk too. Here if you need to talk to someone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ste_Tonks @BorisJohnson True, you know he can't make a decision for himself. This is the guy who is planning to leave at the end of the year because his £150,000 a year isn't enough to live on according to him. These government officials need some reality checks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bye! Maybe now @BorisJohnson will actually do his job instead of having strings pulled.  #CummingsHasGone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSimonC90 Oh I know they are. They have been many times I have wanted to have big words due to what they have said online but you know when you have to stop yourself because you know it won't get you anywhere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews Considering how LGBTQIA+ liberty, Race liberty and Female liberty has been considered second class by you and your party for years. I think it's about time religion took its turn for being a second class right so the others can finally be heard with out being attacked by religion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSimonC90 I have one of them on friends on FB and they are so aggressive when things don't go their way and constantly going on about how it's all labours faults lol it's fun to watch them trip on their own words at times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy #WorldKindnessDay to everyone out there!  The littlest acts of kindness can make all the difference to someone's life. Even if it's just hello to make sure people are doing ok. Sending love and support to everyone.  #worldkindnessday2020  https://t.co/4e7fthJ4WY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBiancaDelRio The shade of it all 🤣🤣  https://t.co/5Fn8Jt7hN4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I have been watching #letsplay of #AnimalCrossingNewHorizions and now I need your advice. Yes or no on getting it?  🎮🕹️  #NintendoSwitch #Nintendo #AnimalCrossing #gamer #games #gaming @NintendoEurope @NintendoUK  https://t.co/ICOQwQj0JO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey everybody. I hope your all keeping well today?  It's #FridayThe13th in #2020 let's hope it's a calm day 😁👍  #FridayMotivation #fridaythoughts #fridaypost #FridayFeeling #FridayVibes #fridaymood #fridayafternoon  https://t.co/5qnjssX5RM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@This_Isnt_Greg Nope. I don't have one and I don't intend to have one either<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Your not a bully in the slightest. You have always been nice and fun to interact with on this app. Trust me I have seen some real bullies on this app and your not even close. Just block and ignore them mate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hazzavg Thank you 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RawBeautyKristi You look gorgeous and your collection looks amazing. Shame I am a broke ass person and my make up skills are rubbish. But just wanted to say congrats on the collection<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pringster78 The USA has always been one to upstage the UK.  UK: "we have people dying and the infection rate is rising like hell ps we have idiots in politics"  USA: "home my beer"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glow_smokey @RawBeautyKristi @ColourPopCo Wow this looks so pretty. I am looking forward to your vids. I love your energy and even when in negative in nature you bring such a positive vibe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glow_smokey Battle to the death is it lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you kidding me. This a joke right? I mean I knew there would be another #lockdown because they didn't #CloseTheSchools but they will blame it on #EatOutToHelpOut again. #Lockdown3 is on its way for sure then. This is never ending. Might as well just lock myself away now! 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hazzavg I love this, as a #SonicTheHedgehog fan, can I save it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leerichards182 Yeah I am doing well thanks. Plodding along as best we can during this lockdown 2.0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MongrelAdam You could call it Adam's country side retreats 👍😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leerichards182 Hey Lee how are you doing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robcog1992 Hey how are you doing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReadytoglareYT Awwwww they look so cute 😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Wow that's an achievement. Well will you get an award from twitter coz I think you deserve one for that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glow_smokey And so you should. You are an individual with thoughts, you should use your platform to speak your mind. I thought that was the whole point of social media. You don't have to stick to one subject.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER It's afternoon here biatch but hey lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thus would be awesome. Wish I had the tech to be included in this lol but then again kinda need to jump back on YouTube again too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#behaviour #information #thoughts #emotion #control #bite #model #religion #organised #organisedreligion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It appears to be that nearly all "organised religions" use what's called the BITE model and this in turn makes them a cult. It's not a popular opinion but I bet not many people can argue against it. Organised religion is so dangerous to society and progress in the world  https://t.co/K6ue4TzJ6p<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This doesn't shock me at all. I bet they don't believe in the virus. Also I don't know what the issue is with health care in the #USA. People are dying and all they care about is lining their pockets. It's a joke. Money money money is all they care about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have watched @SonicUndergound a few times and I am now going through it again. One of the best sonic shows around. They need to bring it back. I love the interactions between Sonic Manic and Sonia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning everyone!  How are you all? Good I hope 👍♥️  #goodmorning #goodmorningpost #goodmorningworld #tuesdaythoughts #tuesdaypost #tuesdaywisdom #tuesdaymorning #tuesdaymotivation #tuesdayvibes #tuesdaymood #tuesday  https://t.co/f4Ml7aoNXi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey everyone how are you all doing today? Good I hope?  Well it's the start of a brand new week, have you down anything exciting? #mondaymotivation #monday #mondaythoughts #mondaymood #mondaypost #mondayvibes #mondayafter #mondayevening #goodafternoon #goodevening #afternoon  https://t.co/b76z9z7gSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates That's good to hear ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Hey Dan. I hope your having a great day 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't believe this is happening. We are in the middle of a lock down and they are gathering in a massive group. Where the hell is the logic! Lock down means lock down please people listen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER Is she really still going on. The more she keeps on speaking the worse it's going to be for her. Like seriously she needs to stop now and take a moment off the internet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PerfectlyPinky @itsNICKSNIDER She can borrow mine if she likes it might be give her the power of insight she needs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Wouldn't be fabulous if we won the euromillions. Imagine all the stuff you could do that amount of cash. Would be amazing 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>100% agree<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The joke is in serious bad taste.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fact Also don't go shopping when your hungry 😜<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg my eyes they burn 🔥 who came with this I mean really 🤮🤮<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok not an image I want in my head lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tyleroakley Good luck with that lol being gay is hard enough with out the doing the other lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am sat playing the Sims4 turning my Sims into social media stars lol if only it was this easy in real life to get to that level of social media presence by posting on thing lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Of course there shouldn't be my friend. You do you. You shouldn't be pressured to get into a relationship if you don't want too. If it's not your thing then cool. Your still Dan, bringing daily inspiration and happiness to us all 🥰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates I fully get where your coming from because no one should belong to any one, however a relationship should be a partnership of equals. I know most men don't do that though and can be such control freaks. But you can find ones who let you be you and still do the love thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Garrett_Watts That would be imply he had a soul to split to make Horcruxes. We all know, judging by the past 4 years, that he doesn't have one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey hey everyone. I hope you have all had a peaceful and relaxing #sunday so far?  Always remember to take time for you. How can you help people if you are not 100% your best ❤️  #sundayfunday #sundayvibes #sundaypost #sundaymotivation #sundaymood❤️ #sundaythought  #sundayevening  https://t.co/klLZqIqVeC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamTristanCole And you have proof of this of course?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamTristanCole You do know how mail in ballots work right? They are checked by real people or have you not been following what's been happening the last few days? Ps Joe Biden is my leader Homer Simpson is 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PositiveLad Can we talk about that hat? I mean seriously he has one of those himself? I just thought his cult followers had them but he actually wears them. That's peak narcissism for you right there lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamTristanCole If courts decide elections not TV networks. What did 140 million people sign on a piece of paper for?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Like facts and that's when I was like woah could Tati be lying about everything then. It's a real mind mending thing that's going on and I believe we won't know the truth until it's actually in court<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey I am so conflicted with all this. I want to stand with Tati because I truly believe that she is one of the nicest people I have seen on any platform but people keep on coming out with stuff and I am like really? Can this be true? I believed WOACB coz she made her opinions look...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey hey people. How are you all doing today? Good I hope.  #Saturday #SaturdayVibes #SaturdayMood #SaturdayMotivation #SaturdayThoughts #saturdayfun #saturdayevening #SaturdayNight  https://t.co/BXHAfv7gJD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevenKelly82 Would have to be the beans for me and I have to have the eggs and certain way as well lol I am a weird eater lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ianhwatkins Trump is losing to Biden, he is just feeling a little Deeper shade of blue! 🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glow_smokey I think your just being realistic because you don't want to get your hopes up too much in case it all back fires. Ps I am keeping fingers crossed for you all from here in the UK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well I am guessing, judging from what I am hearing and seeing, that "Stop the Counting" won't work in favour of #DonaldTrump now will it?  #USAelection2020 #USElectionResults2020 #USElectionResults #ElectionResults2020 #Election2020 #elections #ElectionResults #Elections2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey twitter. how are you all doing today?  Good I hope ♥️  #FridayFeeling #FridayMotivation #FridayThoughts #FridayVibes #Friday #fridayafternoon #fridayevening #fridaypost<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump is now feeling a little one for sorrow and all he wants to do is stomp on all of those votes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg this is funny lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey I used to hate looking at this screen too. Also loving the title.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So how is everyone doing this evening then?  All good I hope and keeping out of trouble 🤣  #ThursdayThoughts #thursdayvibes #ThursdayMotivation #Thursday #ThursdayEvening #ThursdayAfternoon #thursdaypost<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Sending you hugs and I'll be watching when I eventually get notified of a video from ya lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You do know that you all have the potential to be the best version of yourself. All you have to do is believe it. Never give up believing in who you are.  Unlock your full potential!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>952 wbu?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glow_smokey Won't he be arrested when he gets voted out because the only thing that is protecting him right now is the fact that he is president so if he loses that then he is screwed because all of the charges against him will come into full affect. Isn't that why he is clinging to this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So it's 5pm here in the UK. What time would that make it in USA?  Just wanted to know when this #Election2020 is going to kick #DonaldTrump out coz last time I managed to check it looked that way. Hows it going now?  #ElectionResults2020 #TrumpvsBiden #Trump #Biden #BidenHarris<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am a crap gamer but at least I know I am haha I do try and play some games though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER She sounds so bitter because Jeffree twitted at you. Sounds like she wants the attention off Jeffree and that's why she is doing it. One word, Jealousy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey hey everyone. How are you all doing today?  #ThursdayMotivation #ThursdayThoughts #thursdayvibes #Thursday #thursdayafernoon #thursdaypost #thursdaymood<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DucFluf Me neither it's a very bad look if you ask me 🤣 but hey it must work for some people. Maybe he is going for the "tough man" look, which judging by how much he throws his dummy out all over twitter that's inaccurate too 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This isn't a very thought out plan of getting people to vote for him. I mean kinda looks like he would kill every1. Yikes! Not exactly a smart move on their end lol  What do you guys think? Good campaign picture?  #Elections2020 #ElectionDay  #TrumpIsALaughingStock #TrumpvsBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DucFluf @BionicPIGtv Is that supposed to be in favour of Trump coz that kinda looks like he would be killing people which is kinda what has been doing from what I have seen and that's the picture they are using to promote him. Not a thought out a plan. I could be wrong though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey And yet I bet if it was the other way round you wouldn't hear the end of it of people. They would be screaming it. But coz the orange man is losing now it's fraud and fixed and mailed votes shouldn't count lol  https://t.co/w8tsvDTDvw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump it's time to leave the White House. Your time is up!  Davina is coming to get you! 🤣🤣  (Ps please not a #TrumpMeltdown when you leave)   #Elections2020 #ElectionNight #ElectionDay #ElectionResults2020 #TrumpvsBiden #TrumpIsALaughingStock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I hear Biden is winning so far?  Must suck to be a devoted Trump supporter now huh?  #Elections2020 #ElectionDay #ElectionNight #Biden2020 #Biden #TrumpvsBiden #TrumpIsALaughingStock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow @NikkieTutorials  this look is absolutely stunning ❤️ you sure do know how to create an amazing look!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glow_smokey And I'll be vice president, all the way from the UK lol but hey it's as valid right? Haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning twitter land how are you all doing? Got anything excited planned? #goodmorning #GoodMorningTwitterWorld #morning #SundayThoughts #sundayvibes #SundayFunday #SundayMotivation #sundaymorning #Sunday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamUk23 Messing everything up. I don't think this will help us at all because there main spread of the virus is in schools but he is once again ignoring that and blaming people mixing in house holds. So I reckon after this lock down we will be back in another one. But what do I know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamUk23 Than the scientists and now they have to do a lock down which his worse than the circuit breaker one which they was advised to do back in September but they didn't. It's not a case of not wanting his job. It's a case of he is ignoring people and doing what he wants and it's.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamUk23 The issue is that he isn't doing a goal job. I would be happy with a lock down rather the Tier system which they put in place that no one could understand coz it was different from place to place and they knew it would end in a lock down but they thought they knew better....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisHasFailedTheUK he needed to #CloseTheSchools coz other wise this #2ndlockdown wont do anything. Mark my words it won't do anything. It's time for this government to go!  #UKlockdown #lockdownUK #coronavirusuk #SecondLockdown #bbcnews #CovidUK #DowningStreetBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly! You have failed once again @BorisJohnson. If you are going to do this lock down then you should close the schools you moron. You go on about mental health but this half arse attempt once again is actually pushing mine through the roof. What a joke #Lockdown2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rdavidson2002 @DearMrAtheist @realDonaldTrump That's the hope. It will take some work because the republicans take up most of the senate and now the supreme court from what I understand which doesn't look good. From what I gather just means that if Joe gets in he is going to have a hard time changing things just like Obama<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UnapologeticLM @DearMrAtheist @realDonaldTrump Awwwww that's a nice thing to say 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeeverShannon @rdavidson2002 @DearMrAtheist @realDonaldTrump I always thought the church and state were separated per the constitution and also the constitution was to be looked at every 20 years so that America could be a progressive country. I will state I don't know everything but some of the things I have seen scares me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rdavidson2002 @DearMrAtheist @realDonaldTrump It may be possible lol I do sometimes look into what's going on because the UK takes its mark from the US a lot. The world is going down down the pan from what I have seen the past years<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DearMrAtheist @realDonaldTrump Even me? An idiot from the UK lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Erm Dustin..... I want to live lol 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey I watched the video and wow just WOW! I loved Tati and stood up for her too. Isn't there any genuine "good" people in the world anymore. Greed is a deadly sin (yes that's a pun and I don't care 🤣🤣)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You are not alone ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rachel0ates Rachel love, I think the best think do so is to just take a few moments, get some rest and recharge. It's no good letting it all gather in your mind while your drinking. put some music on, or a TV show you love. And then when you wake up tomorrow then deal with things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rachel0ates Do the same. Maybe if she did then she wouldn't be so defensive when people, like yourself, give honest feed back. Honestly don't let it get to you. I support everything you said. Keep your chin up and I am always here if you need a chat 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rachel0ates Don't let it drag you down I have just watched your video and you made excellent points. As someone who writes and has a "bad" poetry book myself (even though I have people telling me it's good). I can sit here and tell you I criticise all the stuff I write. She needs to....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xzombie6kittyx @itsNICKSNIDER Oh lol I should have got that one. My bad 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leerichards182 That’s what happens to me, one minute I can be watching something or just sitting here in social media and the next two hours have gone and i am like ooops lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously people are letting fire works off and it’s not even bonfire night. IMO fireworks should be banned from shops and only organised displays can have them because they controlled and they are not harming those are poor animals with the loud noises.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Being born the way are is not a choice, you are a beautiful so embrace who you truly are ❤️❤️  As for bigots well as the saying goes “evil isn’t born it’s made” those who are hating on others need to listen to those words carefully. #LGBT #LGBTQIAfamily #LGBTQIA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER Is really bad I don’t get it lol ps yeah I am thick before someone says it haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does this mean it's ending tomorrow like an article I read somewhere said it was because I hope not I need a little more time to complete what I am doing lol (ps I am guessing PTR is for pc players) #DiablosTwitteros @Diablo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think they have this on repeat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey hey twitter how are you all today? Well I hope? Even though it's miserable and cold up here in Carlisle I do hope you all are having an excellent day so far ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Take note people this is what happens when kids go hungry  #BorisHasFailedTheNation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@topherwalkerb They have no moral conscience that's how. They only think of themselves first. I am sure their kids won't go hungry at all during these hards times and yet people still defend them the country is going down hill and fast with government we have now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates I often have that trouble when looking for something to watch. Nothing really catches my eye so I end up watching stuff I have already watched like a hundred times 🤣 but hey at least I know how it ends.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>McDonald's gives £1 million pounds worth to help feed kids during holiday break!  There fixed your headline so now maybe people don't jump to the obvious conclusion! @MetroUK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's takes little effort to support people and share love in your heart. Always lead with support!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Ooooh what you going to watch? Anything catching your eye?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey twitter how are all doing?  Good I hope?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RickyPDillon I will once I can finish off season 21 of diablo 3, they pushed it back so I can actually try and do it lol but once I have done that then I am straight on to Pokémon 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey hey twitter land how are you all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT I am starting out in make up, and failing just to add coz I suck lol, but even I think this is vile and I don't keep up with latest trends and I have no taste. Why did he come out with this crap. I could do a better job and trust me I have some crazy ideas lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am starting to understand the reasoning Guy Fawkes had #DailyBriefing  #borishasfailedthenation  #borishasfailedtheuk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBiancaDelRio Dunno but that would be a cool job to have though 😜 I can barely get anymore than 700 followers on there lol but my pics are shit so what do I expect really haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MelDMann Manhattan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dancooledaily The guy is s leech he is trying to do anything to claim to fame. What he did to Caroline Flack was disgusting and then tried to play the friend and "be kind" card. I mean how low do you need to go to try and get fame that way. Why doesn't he try getting there on merit instead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JakeeKnox2 @dancooledaily Totally agree. I went on a rant on FB the other day because of all what's going on lately with the media. It's a total joke. What ever happened to the ethics of journalism. I know they have like 5 tenants I think it is just like doctors have an oath. Money is why they do it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coda_cola_ Yep and I have writer's block for going on a year now. I have all these ideas in my head but when I go to write it just comes out all confusing because it's like trying to put all the ideas of multiple different plots. Anyone else have this issue or is it just my brain?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@exxonmobil The president is going on a rant all the time lately and making claims left and right so is it any wonder that places have to put out statements like these and people still want Trump to be president lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The scary thing is I was discussing this the other day and I reckon that the country will split soon into basically like Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool, Kent, all places having their own governing bodies and the country will be divided because of this shit government<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kriscornell56 Afternoon 😄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSimonC90 Only ever been once it seemed like a lovely place from what I can remember<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@richie_rich77 Good song 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katie_loughnane Awwwww he is so cute 😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_liam_hall You expected anything different from people who can't be arsed to work out that instead of lining their pockets they should start to think of the people for once in their lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We can all make a difference if we stand United. People want to see us divided and fighting each other so we can't see what they are doing behind closed doors. We need to stop looking at our neighbors and start looking at the root of the issues we face as a nation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@topherwalkerb The government are using this pandemic to make money as they always try to do. Its all a money making scheme to them so they can rich. Just look at their £3,300 pay rise while other people are losing their jobs, their homes and even their lives to this crisis but they don't care<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaclynGlenn Wow I am so pleased for the both of you ❤️ you two make such a lovely couple<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You are the most corrupt politician going. You have destroyed America and worst of all you have managed to convince people your hero. You know Trump good people don't need to belittle others or scream how good they are. They just do the things. Now be a man and act like an adult<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone is giving it the "17.4 mil voted, we won now shut up" talk but amazingly no one in the comments can answer one simple question.  Is the elephant wrong?  The argument isn't if you won or lost its is the elephant and no one can answer it. Hummm I wonder why that is? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Oooops I did it again too your heart, got lost.... 🎵<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey hey twitter how are you all doing today? All good I hope. I hope you are all having s fantastic Sunday ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is literally what me and my partner said the other day. It will end this way very soon. It may even get worse and the places will break up and become their own too. The country is going to the dogs it really is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amandaoee_ Different opinion but looks good to me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AltSteven1 Welcome back to Cumbria 😁 wait is that a good thing though lol not a lot happens here haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey hey twitter land how are you all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Avril Lavigne - Sk8er Boi (Official Music Video)  https://t.co/khoYbregSA via @YouTube  Just for you @BorisJohnson    Share if you get it 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey twitter how are you doing today?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please I know I shouldn't really comment because I don't live in America but you vote really does count. Make sure you do what you feel is right in your heart to make America right again. I wish we could vote Boris out right now. Nothing good is coming I can tell you that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I may not be American but we also Jane knob who is on charge of this country here in the #uk his name is @BorisJohnson. I know that @realDonaldTrump is destroying America just like Boris is destroying the UK. Its honestly making my heart ache watching it all unfold.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some days are good and some days are bad but always remember you are strong and beautiful no matter what people say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds about right! But then what did we expect from the idiots we have in #Government now. All they care about is money money money and it's clear as day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScotCuthbertson So real life then 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jckhrkn Exactly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too true 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthaig1 I do it. I find it spreads better when butter is put on first lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If this happened I bet the world would be a much bearable place. Therapy can help so many people and yet it costs so much to have it. #MentalHealth #MentalHealthAwareness #MentalHealthMatters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Totally agree 100%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT Remember the rules don't apply to him just everyone else<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey twitter land how are you all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dessiemaeliyah_ My heart goes to her family at this time. People need to think before they comment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dessiemaeliyah_ This is disgusting. How do they know she wasn't trying to get healthy. Did they know her body type? I bet they didn't. Convid is killing people whether they are unhealthy or the fittest person ever so to make these statements is just cruel. What happened to #BeKind<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @BorisJohnson come on tell us all that keeping schools open is a good idea? This is just one tweet that I have seen I bet you can find loads more like it. This isn't about kids well being it's money plain and simple and it's sick! Put the people first before your pockets!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT I dread to think hun. There always new drama isn't there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You are not alone, even if you feel like you are, I have been there and trust me i know it's not nice but I hand realised your never really alone so please if your feeling low then you can always DM me they will always been open. Support is always out there. #MentalHealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well it's official I am now 32 lol happy birthday to me. Well I have been all day but I am always late on posting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not a bad remix of @OfficialSteps New song "What the future holds"  What do you guys think?   https://t.co/2K5sTpwdsV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey twitter how is everyone doing today?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This irresponsible and disrespectful to the people who don't care the level the care he has gotten. This man is a danger to the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaigeChristieUK Awwww cute<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey hey twitter 😁  How are you lovely people doing today?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This so accurate 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey twitter people. How are you all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ste_Tonks Ooooh that's a pretty one 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ste_Tonks I normally get about that myself but I needed to be up this morning and was up late last night watching crap on Netflix. What tattoo did you get?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So my sleeping pattern last was not great but hey ho what can you do. How do you guys sleep? 💤  #fitbit #fitbitversa #versa #sleep #sleeppattern #sleeping #sleepingpattern #sleepcycles #sleepcycle #sleepingpatterns  https://t.co/ZxjeKgfNL7<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Well 3 and half pound on which isn't great at all. That puts me at 20 stone 2 pounds. #slimmingworld this is not what I wanted and I am trying my best to do something but I need to try harder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>About to get weighed in at #slimmingworld let's see what today brings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT Jaclyn hill being a hypocrite who would have thought 🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope your all having a good afternoon people? Remember you are loved, you may not feel it at times, but you are. You are loved by people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenDragonQueen I avoided it. I may not be American but I do worry for the future of it because of what’s going to happen in November. I do try to avoid these debates because they just turn into war games and shouting matches<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marshawright I think I would either be a swimmer or runner as I loved to do both when I was younger and then I discovered take aways and alcohol and got fat but hey we can all dream right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mark_wootten I have to stop watching and reading about him because he makes me so angry. I mean I get glances because it’s hard to avoid, however, I am trying to avoid it all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimChapman Hey 👋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning twitter. How are you lovely people?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey you gorgeous people!  How are you all doing? ❤️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Watching @DearMrAtheist videos and I am sat here laughing that he actually gets emails from trump's camp lol I mean I guess they don't watch his videos at all 😂😂 you rock Jimmy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok for some reason I got locked out of my account earlier today on here and now magically it's back but I have lost all the people I was following. What the hell happened @TwitterSupport  @Twitter I have never had any issues but today I have? I didn't do anything different.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/DScV8xDDuu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So it's Bi visibility day 2020!  I would just like to say that you're loved and valued. Your voices will be heard today and should be heard every day just as much as everyones. I am sending my love to you all ❤️❤️  #BiVisibilityDay #LGBTQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey hey you lovely people 🙂  How are you all today? ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amandaoee_ Do humans count? Coz I seem those idiots every damn day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awwwww look #jeffree is giving away money people to help them out!  Does that mean all is forgiven now? Or is it only ok because he basically buying your credibility? Asking for a friend.  #jeffreestar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I haven't posted in like forever on my #youtubechannel , I know I know I am a crap #YouTuber , and I get this comment on my spill video I did. I then I check this person accounts and guess what they following all of spills accounts lol. I mean come. Biased or what!  https://t.co/WDxu1ILwvy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are people really #panicbuying yet again? Didn't no one learn from last time they did it? And people wonder this country is a mess, well I think the way people are handling things is a chaotic at best. Stop panic buying you will be fine!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@penqthegod Didn't Facebook do the exact same thing though like a year ago? I mean have their menus at the bottom and I am sure twitter have done it too. I just don't see why people are angry about it. Plus I thought Instagram was the place to post these days<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see people are losing their collective minds over this "new" layout on #snapchat ? I have had this for now and dont see the issue. What's the big deal?  #snapchatupdate  https://t.co/no3OtYFEzF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So new restrictions have been put in place here in the UK, what are your thoughts?  #boris #covidbriefing #Covid_19 #COVID19 #Lockdown2 #lockdownUK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey hey twitter land!  How are you all? ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MindCharity Oh I do apologise. I copied and pasted it from a Facebook post I saw. I am very sorry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The mental health issues related to lockdown and the pandemic of COVID19 are hard for everyone, but especially for those already battling with their mental health. The wonderful charity MIND has a 24-hour helpline: 0300 123 3393. Please could people share this out 💚<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER @ThreeDailey That is so "fetch" lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Mr Ben can't his doctor wife wet according to him. I hate to tell him that even me as a gay man I have managed to get a woman wet before I came out lol so I feel for his wife coz clearly he can't get off. Ps Ben porn is a great help pmsl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GodlessEngineer That's never going to get old 🤣🤣 ps I have a message for Ben that he isn't going to like lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is this shit really 😠<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GodlessEngineer Omg this angers me so much. I am someone who has health conditions and could easily go to my doctor and by one of them to be exempt but I don't want too. I want to be protected and others to be protected too. Ps I hate wearing them too, I can't breath and I wear glasses lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What do you lovely people use #Twitter for?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This video makes me sick!  How the hell does this woman have channel still up and still teaching women things like this. Wake up people. Things need to change.    https://t.co/uxw41fo9l8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DearMrAtheist @jk_rowling This is so upsetting. I defended her when I first heard about her tweets and I love Harry potter but the more I heard the worse it got. As someone who loves to write I looked up to her and now I have lost all respect I had. Still love Harry Potter though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trans women lives are valid!  Trans men lives are valid!

<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT Oh I bet you have the same thought I have. I have tried to not look what's going on in the drama world but all I am seeing lately is Trish in people's thumb nails.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT Oh f**k sake what the hell now! Can't the YouTube community just have some time off?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congrats to @GodlessEngineer for reaching this amazing feet of 50k subs on YouTube. Only way is up now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReadytoglareYT I feel like I can't watch it.  I have been losing my mind over a lot the last few days and if I started watching it I would lose my mind even more, well that and I don't pay for netflix anymore so I can't watch it thankfully<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do things for you that will give you fulfilment. Don’t do it for others do it for yourself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaSpillYT I keep on seeing this being talked about and I echo your sentiment so why hasn’t Netflix done something because there is so many people angry with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MartinLondonTHT It’s awesome that you do the work you do. So brave of you to come out and share to the world. If your not ready to tell your parents then that’s ok. You will do it in your own time. Don’t feel pressured. Keep shining brightly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@M_Struthers You would think but you know people have to go over the top with things<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanA____ Bet you will still look fabulous though lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leerichards182 Sounds more productive than my day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mark_wootten The rules I think are ridiculous tbh. I have a theory as to why it’s spiking and a way to stop it but people don’t seem to like either thoughts lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_JGD94 I think it’s impatience but hey I could be wrong lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leerichards182 Hey it’s been good thanks. How has yours been?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always remember your not alone ❤️ xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRainbowist #DonaldTrump being a racist and homophobic?  Just shocking  🤣🤣 I mean have you been his supporters? Seriously the sheep that follow only follow because they believe in their masters ideology<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now this would be interesting experiment to see how they would all ready if they got asked lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nick_LGrant @HopeRomanticGay I'm 32 and still don't know how to face tune lol I still look like a mess haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CAA_Official But but but..... We have to follow believer everything that's been said on the internet. It's like, law. 🤣🤣 (The most annoying part is I actually spoke that as I tweeting it in such a stereo typical high school girly voice lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey You could have them all taken out and have dentures 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And if you ever feel like you need someone to talk too guys my DMs are always open #MentalHealthAwareness #mentalhealth #MentalHealthMatters #SuicidePrevention #SuicideAwareness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey And we all love you too Dustin. Now what are you after lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amandaoee_ Love this song 😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The world maybe against you but you have the power to change your fate. You make your own destiny. You are powerful no matter what people tell you. Make your life your own<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Elstro1988 Wait what? When has this happened? I have always had respect for people who cook coz I am a shit cook lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRealRickP Now that’s something I would totally do lol epic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScotCuthbertson Can we just talk about how she is saying it’s a safe guarding red flag? There is plenty safe guarding issues with children the lgbt label isn’t one of them, religion on the hand is subject to discussion to being a safe guarding issue. Bet she won’t say that though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReadytoglareYT This is my mental state even after sleeping good. I am not sure why but I laughed at myself after saying that. I guess if you can't laugh at situations then you will cry over them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReadytoglareYT Totally agree. The amount of abuse I get for liking the band's or artist I do. It's shocking<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hey hey all how are you doing? Hope all is well?  Remember to take time out of each day to center yourself and breathe.

<|startoftext|>@ReadytoglareYT I think it's disrespectful. Whether you believe in the cards and the afterlife or not (which I do, just for reference) it's too soon and to have that many ads on it just looks tacky as hell. If you want to do a reading then they should have done it in private in my book.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EgglestonMathew Totally agree 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SunnyMissuny @gutterslut666 Totally with you. Greed is so deadly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey hey twitter how are you all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey hey twitter land 😀 how are you all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey hey everyone. I hope your all doing well?  Hope your all having a relaxing #sunday 😌  Always remember that no matter what life throws at you.

<|startoftext|>Had to start from scratch on the game so please add me up guys I need all the help I can get right now lol. #Simpsons #thesimpsons #simpsonstappedout #tappedout #thesimpsonstappedout  https://t.co/cfj0mxxvod<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SunnyMissuny @gutterslut666 It all makes me sick , the polices that they have in place now isn't to protect children or people. It's to protect peodos and criminals coz that brings them in money. But you know they ban LGBTQIA+ education content. It's twisted out of control now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mark_wootten I like it when it’s warm but when it gets too hit it like wow it doesn’t go down well here lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReadytoglareYT Why hasn't this guy been blocked on the big platforms yet. I have seen so many things about him so how has he managed to still have the platform he has. It's shocking how he still around<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And you know this how? Shouting off twitter doesn't automatically make it a fact! And the comments I have seen to it is shocking. So answer me this do you lot actually work in these organisations? I bet you don't so how do you know what they do fully?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@unit_1974 Oh I agree it's totally weird I have never seen anything like it. From what I have read it's shocking. I don't get people sometimes I really don't. Common sense has vanished it really has<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@unit_1974 On the same page with you here. I do not understand why people think it's hoax. I mean the results have been shown so I dont know why people are not taking the right actions. I think it's because they selfish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mark_wootten I like it when it is warm but the heat wave we have had has been a lot to handle this year. Or is it just me what can't handle the heat too well lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mark_wootten I think summer has official gone. But I could be wrong it could come back with bang next month<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So we have star wars in the sims4. Can I ask why ? Like who asked for it? I like Star Wars before anyone comes for me. But I am trying to work out how these two things would blend together well. So again why? #Sims4 #StarWars<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love my new #facemask 😷 (I have issues with masks just like most people).

<|startoftext|>@UnitedSheStands Exactly 👍 I look at these models and what they have to go through and just impossible for anyone to do that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please tell me this a joke right? I mean seriously eating peanuts in church and you get that. Wtf 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UnitedSheStands I think the beauty/ fashion industry puts to much pressure on people to look perfect. It is geared more towards girls I just admit though and its wrong<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Well you now have to wear face masks in train stations and they actually have people at the doors so a) they are now checking tickets where they don't barriers (like in my city) and also so that you put on your face mask. This is great incentive to get the virus under control.  https://t.co/G3T0ex22ZS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You start to go on your YouTube channel and try to twist everything to suit you. I can't believe you expect people to believe you. I will admit you apologising to @jamescharles was a good thing but what about everything else @JeffreeStar ? You can't hide this forever.....n<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You started this. You, and Shane, manipulated people behind the scenes so you could get ahead. I can see straight through this bull. Also you haven't stayed off social media.

<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Is it your peak or is it just the start?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Well if it isn't mrs Midwest. She reminds of the wicked witch of the west more like. I wonder if you managed to that hair wet would she melt away into oblivion lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER @ThreeDailey Now that's some shade nick lol 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where is the lie here? There is no she limit to how some can be manipulated. Also what domestic abuse. Where do you think that shit starts from? Do you think a man just starts bearing his wife? No it starts mind games. So get off your soap boxes and pay attention.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning everyone. I hope your all doing well?  #goodmorning #goodmorningbritain #thursdaymorning #thursdayvibes #ThursdayMotivation #ThursdayThoughts #Thursday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Congrats Dustin. All that hard work is paying off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rachel0ates All smiles 😊 you both look so happy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The mind. I wish I know I have been very local on the situation but I think I should get back to what I wanted to do which was actually help people and be there for people. To be positive and show love and compassion. I might comment more on this stuff or I might not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know I think I am starting to lose my energy to try and figure out which drama is coming next. I have my own thoughts on whats been going on. I am starting to think that they all have shade but the biggest one making all chess moves is #jeffreestar. But this is tiring on...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well this makes so much sense about why Jeffree star never bashes Morphe but attacks every other brand. Hummm it's all starting to make so much sense now   https://t.co/MreOcEmkof<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Of course lol it's usually the way. Have safe travels<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man I can't type but oh well I think people will get it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The truth will always find it's way out no matter how much these big influencers try to manipulate/ delete/ hide it. It will eventually find its way out. My honest opinion it's that @YouTube got rid of all troubling ones and promoted the real talent of the platform.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Omg this is so the truth well and truly. I am getting sick of them using mental health as an excuse for their shit actions. It's makes a mockery of us who actually do suffer with real mental health condition such as autism, sever depression, etc. It's disgusting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What do you guys think of this? Do you agree with my theory or do you have one of your own? This is just so messy isn't it! Let me know your thoughts!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There must come a point when you have to think what the hell is going behind the scenes of things. This shift of position has got to shake things up now. It's time for change people. We need to show more no problematic people in the #beauty industry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coda_cola_ Totally true and this is the guy who made it to be president of the United States. I mean the UK ain't any better really we have Borris Johnson. Trump light we can call him. How these men got into power I'll never know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coda_cola_ Isn't his whole building a "symbol of hate" because of everything that he represents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey I would just use the bigger option. Never can too many clothes. Am I right? Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good afternoon all. I hope your all doing well? Always remember to take time to look after your well-being ❤️  #GoodAfternoon #WednesdayMotivation #WednesdayWisdom #WednesdayThoughts #WednesdayVibes #MentalHealthMatters #MentalHealthAwareness #mentalhealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stay safe! And keep being your beautiful selves. Never let the world tell your anything but a rock star. Love you all ❤️💙💜🧡💛💚🖤🤍 xxxxxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Strange that Tati is now friends with James when she knows what he is being accused off. There has to be a reason for it. Or maybe I am reading to much into it. I think it's time for the #jeffreestarisoverparty and the #shaneisoverparty to actually work. This people are not nices<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really want to here your opinions on this because I can't be the only who is kinda feeling this way. Ps I am not trying to discredit someone's sexual assault, I know how rough that can be and if it really did happen my heart goes out the person. I just find this all a little.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why not just post it public and ask everyone's opinions as well the channels too. @TruthSleuthYT @ThreeDailey @angelikaoles @itsNICKSNIDER @glow_smokey @sebas_williams @PaigeChristieUK I know there is more channels but I can't think right now so please people link them below.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't feel confident making a #YOUTUBE video but this is sort of what I would have said. I know it's only focusing on one part of #tatiwestbrook video but it just stuck out to me. I did want to contact some drama channels privately to see their thoughts but thought sod it....  https://t.co/SNeWA4luk3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You guys! I am conflicted right now. I don't know what to do because I want to say what I think but I think it has to be worded so carefully. But then I am a nobody on the internet any way so how the hell are they going to see anything that I post on any social media platform<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rachel0ates That's so adorable 😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaNdE_8 @TeaSeshYT @ThreeDailey @petermonn @TeaSpillYT @looksbyliam I wouldn't be surprised either if he did that. When will this ever end though that's the real big question<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need some #YouTuber  advice regarding a theory I have on this whole #tatiwestbrook #jamescharles #jeffreestar and #shanedawson "drama" that's going on. I would send a DM to people like @ThreeDailey @TruthSleuthYT @angelikaoles @itsNICKSNIDER @PaigeChristieUK but 2 nervous to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaSeshYT @ThreeDailey Oh my god. This just screams that Jeffree is either a major share holder in the company or is a part owner. Shane and Jeffree are both to blame for this. Why is Jeffree getting away with all this shit again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey I have a total theory on this. I don't know if to come back to YouTube to put it out there or not yet but I do a theory on it that I believe might be interesting for some<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning all. How are you?  #goodmorning #wednesdaymorning #morning #WednesdayMotivation #WednesdayVibes #WednesdayMotivation #WednesdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey The truth will come out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Totally agree with you there.  It's going to get way out of hand. I think we need to remember though that this is now getting very serious. It's not longer just "tea" now. It's getting legal &amp; serious. I can seeing things exploding very soon. But who will survive this. Who knows<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am sure he thinks it is. This has to end soon because it is getting serious now.  #shanedawson #jeffreestar #jamescharles #tatiwestbrook #reallife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Out when it's ready too not when Jeffree demands it too. This all going to get a lot worse before it gets better and I can actually this getting very legal soon. This beyond just "tea" it's real life. This isn't a TV show/ teen movie. It's not mean girls Jeffree even though...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is so true. There is still a victim out there and don't forget guys Jeffree Star is still using those voice notes to manipulate his narrative which he shouldn't be. It's not his story to tell so why is he telling people. If James Charles has done this then it will come....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dianaplantana @glow_smokey I tried having this conversation with my cat. She just sits and looks at me for about five seconds and then it's like "oh shut up human" and walks off lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey I know. It's kinda sad watching this all unfold<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a very good point! They shouldn't have asked her to do that. But as we all know YouTube has to keep their image right!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Oooooh Dustin 🤣  https://t.co/rtEO8wEuj2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hummm well this doesn't look good for Shane does it! Makes you think maybe he goes to hiding coz the shit he is being called on about is actually true now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh my god I have been sat here crying my eyes out watching @GlamLifeGuru  video. It's disgusting what #shanedawson  and #jeffreestar has done to her. You know what you bitches if you want to act like your F***KING school kids then go play somewhere else. We are all adults here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh wow I just got the notification for @GlamLifeGuru  new video. This one is going to be interesting when I get to watch it. Is this going to be the one that reveals it all? And breaks it all apart. Is @JeffreeStar , @jamescharles and @shanedawson afraid now? Let's all see!  https://t.co/9MrpaA6Hxc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Oh Jesus. I have a queue of videos but just added this video so this one is going to break the internet I bet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know when life kicks you down. Get right back up and dust yourself off and try, try and try again ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's sad but it's the facts 💯 which is so annoying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shelbsou @glow_smokey I think I need some make up tips from her as her looks are awesome.  I have started playing with make up myself so think I might need to get some serious tips<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been watching @glow_smokey videos and wow the points you make sure amazing and the make up is stunning 😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ribotto_Studios @ThreeDailey Totally agree with you. These people are disgusting. What does through their heads when they do these things. Like seriously<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ribotto_Studios @ThreeDailey 👋 it's time for them to go  https://t.co/llX3x5Q7EP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Held accountable for their actions of the shit they have put out there on to the internet. You guys don't like cancel culture because guess what your favs are finally getting caught with it all. It's time for change people. #CancelCulture<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Enough is enough with the defending of this. I can not believe I am seeing people defending his actions with that kind of content. It's sick. He made the choice to make that content no one else. Ps cancel culture isn't toxic. It's only toxic because your fav is finally being....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Defending him on this one. When I was a "horny teenager" as you have you put it. I have never wanted to make sexual jokes towards CHILDREN. And before I have people coming at me saying he was going through a hard time. We all have but that doesn't excuse this kind of behaviour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have heard it all now. Someone is excusing Shane's content as he was just being a horny teenager. Like what the actual f**k. First of all he wasn't a teenager. Have we all done embarrassing things when we was younger? Yes. But no where has anyone sexualised children. Stop...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Please not more stuff. I can't handle it anymore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Influencers were taken off their platforms because this shit affects young minds and if they see that these people can get away with it then they can. This has to stop. #ShaneDawsonIsOverParty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hell can we forgive him for all the stuff that's coming out? It's also funny how his "best friend" has not defended him, not once. What's the matter Jeffree trying to stay face because you have a horrible history too? Have you got stuff to hide too? It's about time these....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He copes with things but come on, I know plenty of people who have been some hard stuff, me included, and I have never done shit like this. Comedians use their art to project I get that. But what comedian do you know who has done this? A lot of the stuff is just sick. How the...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well things ain't looking so good for #shanedawson is it really? I can fully understand why this happening. The racism side I can't comment as it's not my right to accept or not too on that. But the children stuff I mean really? He said it's because of his past and that's how...  https://t.co/Gmh6scHmer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is awesome. For all us @Pokemon lovers. Eevee/ #Pride  power ❤️💜🧡💛💚💙🖤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watched @ThreeDailey video and apperently I missed a lot on here. I don't come on for a day and a lot happens. The Smiths have gotten involved? More Shane stuff is coming out? Omg guys I can't keep up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rachel0ates You think a man follows instructions lol 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamleenelson @Luke_Egg19 @Pringster78 This is what worries me too. People are going crazy now that lock down has been eased when they still need to be cautious and they ain't. But we shall see what will happen. I am just trying to just annoyed with the way both the people are acting the government too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pringster78 @Luke_Egg19 Totally agree with you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Luke_Egg19 @Pringster78 The problem is that we won't know the affects of anything untill it's to late. Things get hidden until it's too late. That's how the government works<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Luke_Egg19 @Pringster78 I know you have that opinion and I respect that, but I can see it all going the other way due to peoples actions. We shall see what happens<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leerichards182 That's good to hear<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Luke_Egg19 @Pringster78 And you have to ask why it isn't. What are they trying to hide? I am not saying all this to have at you at all. I just think we are heading back into hard times due to peoples actions and the government are hiding things from us<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Luke_Egg19 @Pringster78 The R rate I have read on Birmingham live on here, and the death rate I read on sky news I believe. It came up on my Google news thing but I am sure it was sky news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Luke_Egg19 @Pringster78 I have read different. According to the news today. There was 189 deaths which is up by a fifth than what it was. It is rising. And the R rate is rising too. In the Midlands it's gone up to 0.9 which is almost at 1 so that's not looking good either. It is rising all round<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leerichards182 All good here thanks Lee what about you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pringster78 I know. It's getting me heated too. I just can't believe this is happening. The country needs a shake up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pringster78 It does seem to be going round doesn't it. I can't get my head around what I am seeing people doing. It's going to cause a second wave. The death rate is rising again from what I have read so if lockdown happens again we all know who to blame this time. Idiots<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pringster78 Yep! Got to love the "common sense" of the British public.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hello everyone. How are you all?  #goodafternoon #SaturdayMotivation #SaturdayThoughts #SaturdayVibes  #Saturday #SaturdayMood<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Facebook can be very depressing with all the stuff that goes on there. I try to ignore most of the posts these days<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So how do you guys feel about Shane's video? I feel like he is being genuine here but on the racism side it's not my apology to accept there. Can he be redeemed from all this? Or is it too late? Let me know your thoughts?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Oh yes!  https://t.co/4460N8TGil<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Oooooh cryptic. Hi Tati 🤣🤣 so when's the video dropping<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaigeChristieUK Wow now that's working the grind 👊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT See that's where I also have an issue. Why should Jeffree escape free from all this. He has shown his true colours too. Shane's may look worse but JS is just as bad with the stuff he has done. They both should go down for these things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pride is about still fighting for our rights. If may look like an excuse for celebration and piss up. But it's not. It's a celebration of our rights.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Let's make it a little more interesting shall we lol  https://t.co/kL7f21A55P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT I wonder how he will climb himself out of this one. Wait actually yes I do. He will play the mental health card because that way he will get his stans to say people are bullying him. I can see it happening. It's the same old get of scandal card<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey So your looking fabulous then 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey And YouTube promotes these people so they have millions of young followers. This is just making me feel sick man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jazz_rodz85 @ThreeDailey 100 percent agree with you there. I believe they won't actually change unless something drastic happens because they have been allowed to get away with it all for so long that they need a shake up and a dose reality to make them realise what the real world is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER @ThreeDailey @GiaGunn Wait what! This doesn't make sense at all. First says believes it's a hoax then rambles on how's it's not as bad as it seems? So is it a hoax or not in her eyes then? Someone make this make sense for me please?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey How predictable of the internet to do such a thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jazz_rodz85 @ThreeDailey Your entitled to that opinion hunni and that's ok I just feel differently that's all. A lot is coming out right now and I feel that's it's time they both were held accountable for their actions is all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jazz_rodz85 @ThreeDailey Oh please JS has just as much stuff to hide as SD has that's why they are best friends. Birds of a feather flock together. They are both as guilty as each other.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Of course the stans will come out and try to defend them. This is why they get away it coz their stans will always defend them so they will always live in ignorance. Makes me so angey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey People are mad because they don't understand where racism actually comes from and they are too lazy to actually do the work to educate themselves of why black face is totally wrong and why white chicks isn't. People really should ready a book or maybe do some research<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why he needs to be held accountable now and so does Jeffree Star. It's time @YouTube, @Twitter, @Snapchat  did something and took away their platforms. This is where "cancel culture" needs to work. This is sick and disgusting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Well this shit just gets worse.  Why has he managed to get to the position he has. It's ridiculous how people like him and Jeffree have managed to get to the positions they have with the disgusting things they have done. It's time they was over now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg it's raining here finally which means the air should be more clear. I also hear thunder so bring on the storm 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamUk23 It's all just pissing me off. I don't want another lock down cos its not doing good for my mental health honestly and I taking it out on everyone. So if they do this again I will be on the war path with these morons who are doing this now. I fully blame the government<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This may be unpopular with people right now but I don't care. I can see a second wave hitting the UK because people of the way people are acting and the way the government are behaving. #coronavirusuk #coronavirus #Corona #Covid_19 #covid19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg that's one way to get pay back haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@evilnoob Tick tick tick lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER I mean she could have just said you have a sexy voice lol but what ever floats her boat haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey hey people. how are you all?  #goodafternoon #FridayFeeling #FridayThoughts #FridayVibes #FridayFunDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DearMrAtheist What kind of "discussion" did they want to have then? I mean I couldn't make sense of that (although might have something to do with its almost 5am and I am half asleep lol)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where is the lie?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaigeChristieUK @itsNICKSNIDER Omg I'm crying lol 😂 you two are so funny  https://t.co/DnIYwhm7nw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OMFGITSOSCAR @ThreeDailey More like 'Bitchcraft" 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Oh ok. Wow I feel like I am in the film mean girls and it's all just like huh who did what now 😂 and waiting for it all to explode.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jack_Septic_Eye Amen to that. It's hard to keep up everything that's going on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey "force unfollows" I feel like my brain is melting in this heat. Plus I'm a thick lol what does that mean again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is so accurate. They will try and use this to say that "cancel culture" is toxic when in reality it's about being held accountable for their actions and trust me some of them need to be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's like 24 degrees at 2.40am in the morning. The heat needs to do one already I can't sleep at all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey It was a great video and you didn't bash him even though in my "humble pie opinion" he deserves to be dragged to the empire state building and back for some dose of realitea and so does Jeffree too then maybe they will start actually see their reflections in that cracked mirror<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey @theviewersvoice It was a great video and you didn't bash him even though in my "humble pie opinion" he deserves to be dragged to the empire state building and back for some dose of realitea and so does Jeffree too then maybe they will start actually see their reflections in that cracked mirror<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>See guys this is the guy of social media influencer we need. We need people like Jenna. Like I said in my previous tweet I don't know her well but from what I have heard she is an amazing talent and brings to much light into the community. Please don't leave #JennaMarbles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait a second!  I wont pretend 2 know #JennaMarbles at all cos I don't. But she has come out with this video &amp; apologised 4 her past &amp; from what I see a lot of ppl are canceling her. But @JeffreeStar  &amp; @shanedawson  are getting a free pass. Some1 explain this BS to me please?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man this heat is driving me nuts. It's actually making me feel sick. Anyone else feeling this way or is it just me that's getting this bad?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ste_Tonks I have heard which I can not wait for. I don't usually like them but I feel like we need them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg man this heat is going to kill me off 😭 we need a storm asap to clear off the air<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Oh Dustin I could go on a full on rant with you about things lately with all of them. But I feel like everyone is doing that so I'll just echo your statement<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey @Apple Wow that's expensive for a phone 😮<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is what I need right. This heat has driven me to this  https://t.co/5wcBYa4vrB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So very accurate of the 90s music lol kids today will never understand the coolness that we had back then haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What are you thoughts on this? I can't be the only one who is watching all this and wants it to end and for people involved to be help accountable for their actions. Right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have been watching things come out about @JeffreeStar and @shanedawson and I am wondering will @YouTube take action this time? Will this be the tipping point cos they can't ignore this forever. Can they? I really believe the #beautyindustry isn't toxic. Ppl at the top are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What are you thoughts on this? I can't be the only one who is watching all this and wants it to end and for people involved to be help accountable for their actions. Right?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Pink Your a badass female who isn't afraid to speak up and they don't like it because they know they are all bunch of useless morons and your speaking truth. You keeping rocking love . Your doing an amazing job<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER @ColleenB123 Oh dear what's happened now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CAA_Official Isn't Preston up north? Or am I getting my geography mixed up. I usually do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toxxxicaddict @Graystripemkc @ThreeDailey Yeah it would be interesting but you know what they these "famous" stars are like they have an imagine to maintain so they have to be scripted or it just won't work. I mean come on the girl got married for clout<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CAA_Official That's cruel lol, I guess you live London you have to have a quick wit otherwise the city will rip you apart won't it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CAA_Official Oh my god I would be howling after that haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Graystripemkc @toxxxicaddict @ThreeDailey Good luck with that one. You know they need get approval from their managers first. It's all about the acting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CAA_Official Oh I have been called that too. I bet you looked great in that gear 👍 that's probably why they gave you abuse. You looked better than they did lol. I don't get why people have to use abuse like that to hurt people. I mean everyone is just living their authentic life to me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Lol I'm dead haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CAA_Official Same here 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CAA_Official Oh no this was when I was living in brum. I have hardly heard it up here. I think it's getting fazed out now as a slur. But when I used to go out a lot in my teen years I heard it a lot. Maybe I am just old lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CAA_Official It is used here. Its used all the time by people who want to be homophobic to the LGBT community. I have heard it many times with in the Birmingham area<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CAA_Official It's all about the context in which you use the word *fags*. If your using it to describe cigarettes then it's fine but when it's used to describe gay men and usually as an insult that's when it's not ok. It's all about context<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey And her stans bang on to me about her mental health and how I should leave alone. Yet when we do this is what you get. She is one of the toxic ones of the community. She is pure poison and so are her stans. There is something about her that isn't making sense to me though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT Ali...... I can't take anymore of your vids lol they are pure entertainment. You are bringing the dish ain't you lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyMRoberts Oh I haven't been that for years but I think I might get some anyways just to be on the safe side<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Well my bad haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Hasn't Shane decided that he is now coming off social media because it's too much for him? I mean a 30 something years old man can't take the criticism. Reminds me of a few others tbh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not all toxic. People need to give these influencers more attention than the problematic toxic people they have been. Let the real stars shine for once<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Who pissed you off? Let it out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DearMrAtheist Oh you mean like religion doesn't exploit every part of someone's life?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's ok guys your allowed to feel. #mentalhealth #MentalHealthAwareness #MensHealthWeek #MensMentalHealthWeek  https://t.co/hOQMjqHurk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is amazing thanks for pointing it out @Garrett_Watts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Garrett_Watts This is a very good feature I didn't know existed and great for people who suffer with mental health 🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyMRoberts Well if that's happening then we have no hope really with the way things are going do we.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My heart goes out to all those who have lost their dads, and to the mother's who are currently raising their children with out dad's due to tragedy. You are doing an amazing job. Sending my love and hugs out to all on #HappyFathersDay2020  https://t.co/lLQdzREC9Z<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I see #jeffreestar is just going 2 ignore almost everything that has been said against him by saying this is not how we do things now. He basically just wants 2 surround himself with shiny things &amp; positive outcomes. Sorry love that won't last forever #jeffreestarisoverparty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would just like to wish all the dad's out there a #HappyFathersDay2020 ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Reuters In my opinion. I think there will be s second wave with the way things have been going on and then we will be put back into lock down again but it's just opinion in the situation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got to love having cereal when ever you want lol this is the level of adulting!  #cereal #crunchynut #Food #foodporn #snackfood #snack #snapchattime #snapchatme #snapgay #snapchatgay #snapchat  https://t.co/CT3q2wc9cV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey hey people. How are you all?  #SundayThoughts #SundayMotivation #sundayvibes #SundayFeeling #sunday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaigeChristieUK They are only ok with it because of the person who it is. Let's be honest if it was any one else they would get slammed for it but you know these people are untouchable and basically god's in people's eyes. One day that halo will slip though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey I feel that if she led with facts this time about things then certain big named people would get dragged. Although to be honest at this point they could kill people and still have people come to their defence so I don't know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BritishLivesMatter FFS really? This is what I am seeing now. Y? From what I have read people are trying 2 make out that being British means being "white". Hate 2 tell u all no it doesn't. It actually is the opposite. Britain is multicultural has been 4 years #BlackLivesMatterUK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey everyone. You all ok?  #SaturdayThoughts #SaturdayMotivation #SaturdayVibes #SaturdayMood<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pink_mappy @Twitter Oh please there is freedom of speech and then there is just vile poison which is what she represents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @Twitter finally removed the foul mouthed vile bigot Katie Hopkins!  Or did they? Get it sorted. She shouldn't be allowed to resurface.  https://t.co/XHRZxzucXQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jojomamasitaaa @ThreeDailey @petermonn I will give this a watch soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One day things will come full circle. People can't hide behind their "fame" forever. Karma comes to us all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HmedehDaniel @ThreeDailey @GabbieHanna Again that's a matter of opinion. There are so many other people that bring out so much better content that might be why. Everyones content was affected not just hers. She sounded entitled to me with that situation coz she isn't the only one affected<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HmedehDaniel @ThreeDailey @GabbieHanna See this is where me and you have a difference of opinion. She has always dragged herself into drama that's how this all started. It started over a music video because she didn't get the views she wanted. That how it all started &amp; it just got worse from there. I have seen it all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichLux713 It's just words behind a screen love. I bet they wouldn't even say boo to you in real life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HmedehDaniel @ThreeDailey @GabbieHanna Get some help? Glad your concerned but I am just fine thanks. You might want to check on your fav though she has a tendency to manipulate her fans. I mean don't take my word for it ask around<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angelikaoles Car vlogs here they come lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER @angelikaoles Shade 🤣🤣🤣  https://t.co/0hG9ljH7ln<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DearMrAtheist The guy is a danger to the country and people can't see it. If he gets back into office he will destroy America and start a civil war I really do believe thats what will happen and it's sad to see<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Dramageddon 3: Jeffree star cancels Gabbie Hannah 🤣🤣  https://t.co/vEH5gKip8O<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Wait! How?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Oh for the love of God. Really didn't think that statement through huh? See this is why people reflect and take ownership of their pasts and I mean all of it  https://t.co/cqA7byT2j3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Oh no! What now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why we need #Pride    https://t.co/JGRApKsko5  It's stories like these. Like Sarah's. Pride isn't about all getting drunk and partying like it appears to be. It's about marching equal rights across the world. Be the movement people #PRIDE2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pixlpit I can't wait for it but I bet it will be out of my price range ☹️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hannahmluca @itsNICKSNIDER I know right, I know Jeffree said that he wanted to discuss the matter of James Charles privately but with the stuff coming out that he basically planned the bye sister thing. I would think that he would need to clear his name and fast. And there is everything else<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER Am I missing something? Or is he going to address all that stuff at a later time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER I feel like this only half addresses things. While I feel for him with the self harm I have done myself and been in some very not good head spaces. He may have sorted that out with this post. But what about everything else. Using people? The racism? The bye sister stuff?...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey That's great news 👍 doing all good here 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angelikaoles You will soon be off causing trouble lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good evening everyone. How are you all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just because...!  #snackfood #snacktime #Food #cereal #cocopops #snapchattime #snapchat #snapchatgay #snapchatgay #snapchat👻 #snap  https://t.co/FcLJGd5d73<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dola07386257 @medicatemv @GabbieHanna I am sorry to hear you have been through similar things too. This is why I am annoyed  if you look back on when things happened she wasn't there for her friend. Would you be there for someone you cared had gone through something you had gone through?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thinking of doing streaming. Which one would you guys want to see to start off with a #Pokemon gen 1 play through or a #SonicTheHedgehog 2 play through #AskTwitter #TwitchStreamers #twitchstreamer #twitch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sumac_a @JeffreeStar That's your opinion that people don't need answers. A lot of people see it differently that's why he is being called out because people probably want an apology of some sorts for everything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dola07386257 @medicatemv @GabbieHanna I am a rape victim, multiple times, I am someone who has had mental health problems for countless years and has watched this woman make a total mockery of it. I can see straight through her manipulation. Stop apologising for her. She wants to talk. She knows where I am<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dola07386257 @medicatemv @GabbieHanna Jessie look like a total liar so she is discrediting another woman's pain. The timing of this doesn't look good for her that's why I am calling out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dola07386257 @medicatemv @GabbieHanna What does it tell you? Look at it from an outsider's prospective for a second. She has had years to speak up and tell her side to help other women but hasn't and it's only only because has a song coming out and wants to attack drama channels this comes out now. It also makes...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jujubecool @wifethatcould @ThreeDailey It's all just sick and I asked her out right and guess what one of her fans as replied her reply saying I should watch her video where she explains it all. Is this the same video where she attacks all drama channels too? She is starting to really piss me off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey everyone. How are you all?  #goodmorning #ThursdayThoughts #ThursdayMotivation #thursdaymorning #thursdayvibes #Thursday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@medicatemv @GabbieHanna Explains or manipulates? There is no excuse for what she did if she went through it herself then she should have had empathy and compassion for Jessie but she didn't. A victim of abuse wouldn't have dismissed someone's abuse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sumac_a @JeffreeStar Reaches a lot of people and those people need answers and guidances.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sumac_a @JeffreeStar How can the people expect respect from Jeffree when he doesn't show respect to others. That's just just one of the main issues coming out. It's all good and well hiding saying he wants to deal with privately but things are coming out publicly now. He has platform whidh....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jujubecool @wifethatcould @ThreeDailey I know which is why I am so pissed off. I can see what she has done to other Rape victims and it's like how could you do that to them and be one yourself but on the other hand as a victim myself I don't want her to not be believed. It's a horrible position<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wifethatcould @ThreeDailey I will be disgusted 2. Normally I am very private when it comes to speaking out being a victim myself so I get that part but this just doesnt sit right with me. I would never ditch anyone going through anything like that even if it was someone who I fallen out with. I'd be there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wifethatcould @ThreeDailey This is exactly what I am thinking which is why I am angry right now because it feels like she is just using this to flip the narrative and I don't like it. I could be wrong and she might have been but when add in how she treated Jessie it's not making sense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey If she is then that is just sick. I hope she isn't. I hope even Gabbie knows not to lie about something so serious. It's just the timing of this doesn't sit well and with the way she treated Jessie doesn't sit well either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey I am so pissed off because as a survivor myself I want to know how she has the nerve to sit there and sat that after she ditched Jessie while she was going through hers 😡😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey This is some next level shit. I have a serious question. I have been on a rant for most of the day about her with the whole shadow banning thing and how she is manipulating people. But at what point did it all turn into this:  https://t.co/GQaXIsqeAh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GabbieHanna So then the question is Gabbie why did you ditch your friend who was going through it if you had gone through it yourself? I mean we can't all just unwatch Jessie's video.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey This is exactly why I am getting so f***ed off with people using the whole white chicks thing as come back for TV shows like Bo selecta and little Britain. This is why because white people didn't have this kind racism. People need to look back and get educated before commenting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IngaKarlsson2 @TruthSleuthYT I don't much know about Scientology but if they are doing that. It's horrible. He shouldn't be allowed to get away with any of this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT This makes me sick. I bet it's took this long because those poor women were to scared to come forward because he was a man with money and power.  To many men in power with money and success think they can do what they like to woman it's vile and disgusting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT Ah that I didn't know. So that's how he gets around it. People want the same level of fame as he does so be to approved by Jeffree with the hashtag is a big deal. I see what's going on here. It's a form manipulation and entrapment really?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenLuvsReviews @TruthSleuthYT @CherieWilkerso8 When someone does something once or twice it's decision in the moment but when they repeat those things it becomes a pattern of behaviour in the case of Jeffree this where it becomes a problem because it's not longer just silly idiot things. It's a pattern<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT He shouldn't just avoid this with a cash app give away. Am I missing something?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SelfieMadeBoy She looks like the mean girls at my school who I used to hate. The opposition on the hand looks like my science teacher who I had the major hots for. Ps I have done drag too we never look that lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER What with the what with the what now? (Even trying to type that gave me a headache lol)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@defnoodles I'll have said this about 4 times today. She is a GROWN ASS ADULT with a degree psychology. This bitch knows what she is doing. She is playing the victim card to the max to get her "stans" to come after ppl (which they have done) so gets off Scott free. She a manipulator<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey For the love of God I will tweet correctly one day. I meant to put "is this you foreshadowing Dustin" 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Is your foreshadowing Dustin lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ste_Tonks Oh my life lol sorry I wasn't reading it right 😂 then this exact same one was my first one back when I was kid. I think I was 12 coz my parents were strict at first lol then I got more up to date ones as I got older<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ste_Tonks Something identical to this except it was BT cell net back then lol god takes me back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trishapaytas Hummmm. I think your bias here Trish. Your not only friends with Jeffree your also friends with Shane and everyone else involved too. So I think it might be in your own interested if you just not commented, I know you want too coz your friends but it will back fire.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Lol oh I'll be keeping my hears open for it 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffreeStar It's a gorgeous look no doubt about it. But Jeffree I think you have to address the things that are coming out. This won't just blow over. As someone who has influence you are meant to be leading by example and this all is not doing so. People want answers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GabbieHanna If u have been shadowed banned, which I don't think u have coz ur stuff gets recommended to me n I don't even follow u, ask urself y then. YouTube wouldn't just shadow ban a user who brings so much money for them. This may work on ur "stans" but it doesn't on us<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@futurebehaviour You know you still have to do it right? Lol I had to do it for a friend on her computer at the weekend. But yeah I remember when they used to look like that lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey @GabbieHanna<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>good life and she knows it so does the only thing she knows what to do and that's play the victim. She knows that will get her the attention she wants therefore will get views for her music/books. It's all manipulation. She can't let the material speak for itself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>U all know this all to grab attention for her music video right? So ppl will talk about her. Thing about Gabbie is she knows that a sob story grabs attention from her stans (y do think X factor do it). A negative/ sob story wins out over a positive one, Gabbie has a ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaigeChristieUK Yeah pretty much lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I must apologise to @jamescharles  We all must! It's shocking whats coming out about how @JeffreeStar  and @shanedawson planned the whole "bye sister" thing. I didn't see that coming so again I apologise to you #jamescharles  https://t.co/yleNoIhmJM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey *fat ass I meant lol god dam it 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Oh hunni I have been owed that for that years but they won't give it to my gay 🌈 far ass lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@saiahrett @GabbieHanna It's so disgusting how she is saying he is using the victim card when that is actually what she has been doing for the last 2 or so years to get a music/ book carer going. We see you Gabbie. I know what your game is. Mental health advocate my back side. Where is it now? Huh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MongrelAdam Yeah pretty much although it gets plastered all over my news feeds and every talks about after so I can't escape so I don't really need to watch it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey @GabbieHanna It's actually pretty clever. She plays the victim card &amp; makes out that u r all out to get her. So that when her "stans" come out with stuff like this she will just say that she had no part in it. When we all know that she was the master mind behind it all. Coz she started it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey I just tweeted about her on another tweet. She isn’t stupid. She is a grown ass adult with a psychology degree. She knows what she is doing and it’s disgusting. She is trying to play the victim all the time and it needs to stop. Classic manipulator she is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT This stuff is just getting beyond now. You want yo know why @GabbieHanna is doing all this? For the victim narrative. She is almost 30 &amp; has studied psychology she isn’t stupid she knows what she is doing. This is a ploy to get what she wants. She is manipulating people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hanndelion @ThreeDailey @GabbieHanna Wow just wow this just shows utterly vile people can be. There are real problems going on in the world why is this going on? Focus your energy guys please<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Pringster78 Totally agree with you 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pringster78 I think people are interested in the fact that the "leader", and I say that term loosely, coz by god he can't lead ants let alone a country. Its his morals as a dead bit father that makes him look awful. He is meant to have morals and principles as a leader of this country.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AndyMRoberts I want to know how they have the platform they do. I mean is it because they spout vile comments and create outrage and that's how they get the platform. For being outspoken<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeripateNic Looks delicious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcCorbishley Oh yes ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@quinnproquo Well... 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IAmJScript It's going to be interesting to see what happens<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@colling_phil @ImBotss Just followed you back. Just chilling at the moment. Will be having drinks later on. Why not hey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@colling_phil @ImBotss Up to much today?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@colling_phil @ImBotss Yeah pretty good thanks 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning all. How is everyone?  #goodmorning #sundayvibes #SundayMorning #SundayFunday #SundayThoughts #SundayMotivation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4 years ago today 49 people tragically lost their lives in the pulse night club shootings. Lives that did not need to be lost. My heart goes out to their families on a day like today. They will always be remembered.  ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍  #PulseNightclub #Pulse  https://t.co/RkVPeF5A4q<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TehMimi Well your not wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tweet of the day 😂 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteHolderness I am good thanks 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteHolderness How are you today?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So let me get this right. @TheSun decides to print on their front page JK's 1st husband admitting that he slapped her. Now I know JK is coming under fire for her transphobic tweets, which is not good, but why give this guy a platform? 2 kick her while she is down? #dontbuythesun<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_JohnGDavison Hey 👋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteHolderness Morning Pete 👋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning all. How is everyone?  #goodmorning #fridaymorning #FridayFeeling #FridayMotivation #FridayThoughts #FridayVibes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New blog! A huge movement! #PoliceLivesMatter vs #BlackLivesMattters ! #Equality for all.   https://t.co/yjtUvEuUIv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nick032383 Your right we should be standing together not trying to destroy each other but that's all I am seeing right now though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greznic I think when it comes to riots and looting, that isn't the goal of the movement they are trying to make &amp; that people take advantage of a situation to make it worse. Plus I think police would kinda be breaking their own oaths if they did those things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An interesting question is being raised right now. Is the whole #PoliceLivesMatter taking away from the movement of #BlackLivesMattters and #PoliceBrutality and #systemicracism  here in the UK and US? What are your thoughts?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I see the snowflake # is trending &amp; it's so ironic cos those who are calling us all snowflakes 4 standing up &amp; saying #blacklifematters and #racism should be gone are the 1s crying the most. Who looks like the #snowflakes really? Ps if it makes me 1 to stand up then so be it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kids with disabilities and mental health issues are not weird... all they want is to be accepted... is there anyone willing to copy and paste? I know who will do it... ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson basically only wanted to answer the questions that his party asked in #PMQs  &amp; when others asked he dodged them. So typical of the government. Oh &amp; it's funny how he is spouting about the other side using propaganda now. Guess that only works when they do it right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning everyone. I hope your all well?  #goodmorning #wednesdaymorning #wednesdayvibes #WednesdayThoughts #WednesdayMotivation #wednesdayfeeling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MNaylor_ I totally wouldn't be surprised. She is on the right track to go that far<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MNaylor_ Man that's even more scary can you imagine what she will get next 😮<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who the fuck allows that kind of tattoo in the first place. Her wanting the tattoo is one thing but for a tattoo artist to actually do it is like wtf. I know money is money but come on have self respect.  https://t.co/E9vuhb5naF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Having a nice drink tonight  https://t.co/e918Oz16je<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aaronwilcock91 I'm 31 and don't have a clue lol but I think the  key thing is not finding who you are in this world just be happy with you who you see yourself as. The world will follow around you if you let it ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The idiot tweet of the day goes to this obvious racist. Why though? I don't get it. People keep on saying this country isn't a racist one but clearly it is with comments like this. Someone make that make sense because it doesn't to me. Things need to change and fast.  https://t.co/yeT3dziSKR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@richardosman I often have to stop myself from replying to things I see online and then other times I just type away and thing "oh crap what I have started" but in all fairness though most of the time no one replies back to me so I am safe lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSimonC90 And I am sure plenty of people got a good view 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leerichards182 Glad to hear you felling good 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leerichards182 Hey Lee I am doing good thanks and how are you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScotCuthbertson That just makes it even worse. You know the stuff I am seeing and reading all over social media is shocking. I can not believe how some people act. I thought we was more evolved as a society than this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScotCuthbertson He obviously doesn't realise why they did it. What does he mean by "fake culture war"? It's not fake it's very real. BAME people are oppressed and have been for years. He needs to wake up and smell the coffee I think<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What do people think on this topic? I do these blogs to start the conversation so please let me know what you think?   https://t.co/o8xyVFmS8l  #EdwardColston #statue #BlackLivesMatterUK #BlackLivesMattters #BristolRiots #BLMbristol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey everyone. Its a brand new week. I hope your all doing well?  #mondayafternoon #MondayMotivation #MondayVibes #mondayfeeling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NewProfilePic  https://t.co/HPlnoItSl6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenInLDN @PinkNews @Elle_Drews This is just awful. I am sorry you had to go through this. People can be so cruel sometimes. Keep the conversation going people. It needs to happen to affect real change. The time for it to happen is now. Discrimination in all forms needs to end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT @JeffreeStar I think I missed something but I am not shocked by this information<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This very is important to watch. This is why the protests are happening from black people. We all need to be listening to the words. To the movement.  #BlackLivesMattters  #BlackLivesMatterUK   https://t.co/rRTSU4jWgi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thescubagay Happy birthday 🎉🎂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AhhVeeDaa Thank you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AhhVeeDaa This such an educational video. May I please share this out?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adamski76322625 Yeah I am originally from Birmingham that's how I came to find out about the protests and I was very proud that it was so peaceful. It can be done but I think in London its totally different and the police force handle things a lot differently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adamski76322625 This is why I don't understand why they was used in the protests. I mean from what I saw Birmingham protest managed just fine with out using horses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unpopular opinion: I am seeing a lot hate directed at @jk_rowling  for her transphobic comments (rightly so) but let's not forget the time Ru Paul said that trans women can't be real drag queens. Which to me sounds transphobic. Not defending JK just saying keep the same energy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You wouldn't know law and order if it smacked you in the face!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can I ask a question. So everyone is complaining about people throwing bottles at horses (which I know is totally wrong to start with) in this #londonprotest but why are the police on horses in the first place? I mean technically the police are using them as a weapon so... Huh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sorry...   https://t.co/qbulQZ8wKj  #BlackLivesMattters #apology #gamers #gaming #group #Facebook #gay #BlackCommunity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Obaby01 Glad to hear your doing your fine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the racism needs to end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is shocking. All they was doing was trying 2 help &amp; they get this. This is why racism, homophobia, transphobia etc need to stop. These attacks wdn't be happening if the protests didn't need to happen. But they are happening coz people need to get their voices heard &amp;...  https://t.co/BcFL8hbZng<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning everyone. How are you all?  #SundayMorning #sundayvibes #SundayThoughts #SundayMotivation<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Kpop stans have taken over the hashtag #WhiteLivesMatters ! Good! I have no idea why this hashtag exists. The #BlackLivesMattter exists cos of the history &amp; also the oppression that people of colour still go through in today's world. We need to stand up for our brothers n sisters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boris Johnson didn't answer anything he dodged all the questions just like he always does. Unless your kissing his ass he won't answer your questions. Today's #PMQs was a totally bloody joke. Things need should change but they won't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey hey everyone! How are you all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Janet12358W Anyone can experience discrimination. If they are bullied due something they can not change that’s called discrimination hun<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning. How are you all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_liam_hall Basically they got told off by their bosses who are Tory backed people lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EgglestonMathew Happy birthday 🎂 hope you have a great day 🎉 🎈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pringster78 Hey Matt. How are you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey twitter. How are you all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can you imagine if @realDonaldTrump doesn't win in the election @Twitter will become a playground of abuse for him and his henchmen. It's going to be interesting to see it play out. Like a baby losing its dummy. All hell will break loose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well this very disappointing. No matter what your religious beliefs are you should still show respect. We live in a multicultural society and Boris and trump should get behind that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I reckon they do it so that you don't rat them out @JaclynGlenn but people like me aint blocked and call them out on their crap behaviour. So @AvasFlowers what do you have to say for yourselves? Care to comment on the poor customer service?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaymerChat She is s rockstar. I wish I was good at the game lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blackdogday69 But I bet Boris will still back him though because corrupt politicians stick together<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ste_Tonks I know ☀️ the weather has been great lately hasn't it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaymerChat I know it's a total joke. I am seeing happen all over here. People meeting up in front gardens, in parks and hanging round shops and nothing is being done but I bet the second I go see my mom who lives ten minutes up the road the cops will be called on me 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alex72335099 @s_a_r_k_i_s @SuperSaf @HuaweiMobileUK @Huawei I have a p20 and its running Google on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaymerChat Yeah was playing earlier for a little bit. From the on set it looks pretty cool 👌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Litt1eR3d Skyrim, Darksiders, World of Warcraft, basically any up to date came lol give me the old sonic, mario or Pokémon games any day lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trryptts We share t-shirts, ok maybe I steal his tshirts lol. But other than that no. I find a little weird. Don't know why though we live in the same 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER As an adult who has had autism his whole life this makes me sick. Was I difficult child to handle? Yes but guess what my mother never gave up that's what parents do. They love and care for their children no matter how difficult they may be. 😠<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pringster78 Well we all know that's a lie lol so tell me how come a celebrity is able to get journalist questions before being interviewed but someone like the Prime minister isn't? They are really trying aint they<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You have the potential to be a successful as you want to be. The first step is believing you can be!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Oh I feel you on that one. I moved up north 2 years ago and I remember how stressful it was and I only had a week to do it in. But just think it will all be worth it when you are in the new place 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pringster78 Smiles all round 🙂 😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Been a busy little bee 🐝 today then 🤗<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AdamUk23 @IndieGates Sadly lol I thought I was amazing pmsl not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteHolderness That's the spirit take on the world 🙌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates @AdamUk23 Ah well we can have a party on here lol. See I would do lives on here but I am afraid I would get booed like crazy on here lol twitter can be cruel at times haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HannahHaisman_H @MichaelM238 @BorisJohnson I know I don't know you but my heart goes out to you. Sending you love and support at this time. ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteHolderness Who you saving today Pete?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaymerChat Lol I love it when they put "sharing" on the bags   I mean does anyone share them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamUk23 @IndieGates Not sure to whom that tweet is too @AdamUk23 but if either you or @IndieGates  want my Facebook you can have it lol the more the merrier as they say 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jack_Septic_Eye 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can not believe he has done this. HOW FUCKING DARE HE.  Autism is not a toy for you to use a way of getting out being a cunt! #DominicCummngs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LucyEllam85 So basically he is using his sons mental health as an excuse. That's so below the belt. As an aspie myself and someone who tries to fight the stigma he is total (excuse my language) fuckwit for doing this. Makes me sick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates I use Facebook to do all my live shows now and to scroll through to see what people are up to by that's it. Oh and keep on contact with people on there lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pringster78 You both look great 😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pringster78 Remember to take Nelson with you. He is bugger for egging houses lol  https://t.co/SRFIuVpomL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates I am pretty good thanks 👍. You upto much today?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmmaKennedy Unfortunately there are people out that still believe him just because they don't like opposition. But you know what do I know I am just lonely peasant according to the government<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Hey Dan how are you today?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pringster78 Hello to you and Jackson 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates I recently just got an iPad off my brother (because he isn't using it) and I liking so far lol I am hoping it will help me with YouTube stuff at some point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates I know how you feel. I dread when it comes to five o'clock now because that's when they all come out in force after the big conference. I try to avoid it if I can<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me and the lovely furball. She doesn't look impressed does she lol. Hope your all having a lovely Sunday.  https://t.co/rz0cuw2Aiz<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Would you all be interested in me doing a live on here. A chitty chat or mental health one? I have been doing butcher-aoke ones over on my Facebook and just introduced chat ones on there. So wondering if you would interested on here too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Awwwww how cute and you haven’t seen my hair dan. Don’t worry you look good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If anyone else tried this they be sent to jail for years but these people only get a few months. The justice system stinks. Just because they has money behind them and are deemed to be public figures this is what they get. Disgusting!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey They are really coming for you ain't they? I mean don't they have anything better to do. I mean seriously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spooks730 Lol people are persistent. This would be my reaction to it but no one would want to see me naked anyways so I am safe from this craze what's going on today haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey I am sorry since when did you have to upload all the time. So basically your meant to upload every single second of the day and have running commentary on everything that happens. Next they will want you release all your private texts and record phone calls?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Wait that's a thing now? 😅😅 If I did that I think I scar people for life and they would need therapy for years haha. Plus I don't have a green thumb so I think it would be torment for me too lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Take your time to collect all your thoughts. It's difficult when you find things out that make you question everything. Just take your time. You don't have to make decisions now or answer to any one now. Your mind and life is in your own time. Take each moment as it comes. Hugs<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@itsangelaa_xo Have I missed something?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joey_Rees1990 Nothing wrong with your tats. I don't see why he messaged you to start with if all he had to say was that. I believe it shows how vile he is for deciding to commenting in the first place<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good afternoon twitter. How are you all?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Is it wise to totally wipe your twitter and start again? Just curious I have seen a few people do it and was just wondering what your guys thoughts were on this topic. #AskTwitter #Questions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QbIx08 I agree with that there is a time a place for things my friend. I also think that 2020 will be the year that people will start to realise to that things need to change..... Or not we shall see. I just hope people take this a moment that things need to change<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QbIx08 There is a lot that needs fixing. I think we would be here forever.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DearMrAtheist @telltaleatheist I think your both cool and would love the chance to meet either one of you. Everyone is unique in their own way. I am far from cool and I know that but hey I am guff ball and I own it lol. People will love you and if they don't that's their loss not yours<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey hey people. How are you all doing on this relaxing #Sunday ?  #sundaypost #sundayvibes #SundayWisdom #SundayMotivation #SundayThoughts #SundayMood  https://t.co/bsetXQFjzs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pringster78 Sorry to hear that. There are some nice people out there. Keep your chin mate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robcog1992 I am might be a little behind but what's SC?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaSpillYT I don't have either so your not alone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey And then there is my YouTube channel which is kinda dead 😂 and you Jane morons like this which YouTube activity promotes non stop. Hummmm makes me wonder why I haven't uploaded in a few months.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the first time ever I have managed to catch @DearMrAtheist live YouTube show as it happens.     https://t.co/sjCItGJwf0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heykelechi I don't get why people are having at her. Who is she harming? No one! Her body is her body. If she is confident with herself and wants to show the world then let her be. Some people are just vile.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shann_Q0 I may have missed a tweet coz I only got half of that. It's taught us that life is insanity which I will agree with but I already knew that one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hello everyone I hope your all having a good #Saturday so far?  #saturdayfunday #saturdaypost #SaturdayFeeling #SaturdayWisdom #SaturdayThoughts #SaturdayMood #SaturdayVibes  https://t.co/rBkgsVny4f<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER The self awareness in her tweet and yet her actions and the stuff she says is totally different which makes me think she actually is a garbage person<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DearMrAtheist Trump could just use the mop he calls hair 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rachel0ates Never heard of it the only films I have ever watched that remotely have anything to do with religion is angels and demons and davinci code (if I spelt that right) interesting movies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shann_Q0 Now I know the answer to this one 🤔 I know that if they did allow the gatherings in churches then COVID 19 would spread faster and quicker which would then mean they could pass it on to the rest of us, which is a bad thing right? I think we should ask @realDonaldTrump this one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DearMrAtheist Will be off to see my mates in Birmingham and have a night of drunken karaoke probably and then after that go back to my volunteering lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg people we are saved 👀 the orange #god has spoken himself 😅 we will all out of this hell by Sunday just like I said before. Don't you all feel #blessed now? 🤪<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I think the reason why people are calling him out is because he was totally tone deaf with it. He could have made it a abuse awareness post of or something just to show support but he didnt. It shows his lack of awareness. SFX make up or not. It's mug shot trend not abuse trend!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shann_Q0 3. Atheism isn't a religion. I think he needs to look up the definition of what a religion is. 4. Pagans didn't create evolution, I mean what a dumbass, don't try to explain pagans cos clear you don't have a clue 5. If god made this virus then they proves he is evil not good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shann_Q0 1." I form the light and create darkness" so your god basically his god isn't all loving like he claims right? 2. I hate to break it to him but LGBT families make for better parents than Christian ones have his not heard the abuse those poor kid get (1/2)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So this happened guys 😊  I dyed my hair blonde. Well it was meant to be silver but the silver live dye didn't take it's just made me more blonde after bleaching my hair but I don't mind it you know.

<|startoftext|>Just like many hard times in our lives they are only here for season, we can either sit here in self pity and let it control our lives and let those negative thoughts and emotions control us or we can take action during this difficult season and power through with positive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A very good YouTuber by the name of Shallon says a lot in her videos that things are only here for season. This virus is only here for a season and things will improve. Think of it as winter and we have just wait it out till that glorious spring season time comes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey everyone I hope your all having a good day?  There seems to be a lot of doom and gloom in the media lately. This can have s very negative effect on those of who suffer with our mental health and so I thought I would like to spread some positive spirit out there.  https://t.co/Uf4PAzEh0f<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some great and helpful tips during these isolation periods<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>they are all ok espically those people that live alone. They will feel it more. It's important now than ever to be kind to each other. Situations like these can have such a negative effect on people's mental health. To that end I want you all to know that I am here. My light is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's right guys we can do this. It may be tough being isolated but they doesn't mean we are totally alone. We have the power of social media and phones to keep on contact with each other. It's important now more than ever to to check up on your friends and family to make sure  https://t.co/ETv9cmlSfG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey twitter people 👍😊❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I finally had my mop chopped off 😅  What do you guys think?  Ps yes no I didn't have this done during lock down. This was done over a week ago I am just late posting.  #haircut  https://t.co/I6OTZXYCis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While this can be true most of the time I tend to try and note sugar coat things. Yes it gets me into trouble but I don't care. People need telling and if they can't handle it. It says more about them than it does about me!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I couldn't agree with this more! We need to be more prepared for next time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We must stand together and not further apart. Only when we work together can we come through these very difficult and scary times<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jack_Septic_Eye saw this and instantly thought of you 😅😅 during these struggling times you have to a laugh. But on a serious note. Irish people sober? The apocalypse really is coming 😅😅😅😅😅  https://t.co/4aaOJsJlIf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see a lot of people saying that they cant handle isolation for 2 weeks coz they human interaction. Then there is me. I have been prepared for this I self isolate all the time.

<|startoftext|>@robcog1992 You have a down day. We all have them. Sending you cyber hugs. Let's see what tomorrow brings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg such a savage reply. True but savage 😅😅😅 #COVID_19uk #CoronavirusPandemic #CoronaOutbreak #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Damn some people just plain rude. People should be able to wear what ever colours they want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DearMrAtheist Of course they won't. Pasters of the Christian religion have already started blaming us gays for the virus. Saying it's god's punishment for allowing us to exist. Tbh I'm not shocked at all got to blame on someone it can't be nature. Right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can hear the majority of the gay community starting to panic now lol how will you strike a sweaty Instagram pose now boys lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey @itsNICKSNIDER The bitches of LA? Although I think the Kardashians might have trade marked that already lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanielNewman Am I the only who thinks this is totally wrong? I mean yeah they are good looking but this scene is just gross. They are brothers. So I hope it's fake as hell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh no the #coronavirus has now started affected hollowed @tomhanks and his wife and confirmed they have the virus. Also @realDonaldTrump has put a ban on traveling from and to the USA from Europe but not the UK (weird)  #CoronaVirusUpdate #Covid_19 #CoronavirusOutbreak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #coronavirus is more likely to kill or seriously weaken the elderly and the young so I can fully understand why #Closetheschoolsuk need to happen. Makes more sense than this whole #panickbuyinguk  #coronavirusuk #COVID19 #Coronavid19 #CoronavirusOutbreak #CoronaVirusUpdate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know when you know put a #Tweet out and then read it back, after posting, and realise "oh crap I missed a word out" yep that's me all the time 😅😅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rachel0ates It depends on what your looking really. I was a city boy and lived in Birmingham nearly my life but moved up to Carlisle as of almost 2 years ago and I love it's quite, everywhere is easy to get too and it has some lovely views and the people are friendly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DearMrAtheist 😅😅😅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now this is my kind of #panicbuying lol wouldn't last long though I don't think 😅 before anyone comments no I am not alcoholic. I am a drunk. Alcoholics go to meetings. Drunks go to parties baby!  #panicbuyinguk #COVID2019 #coronavirusuk #coronavirus #COVID19  https://t.co/Xz9Mt3YvN3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My thoughts go out to @rickygervais at this sad time its never easy losing a beloved pet. As a cat lover myself I know hard it is when you lose one of your precious little fur babies. #RickyGervais #RIP #Ollie #cats #catlovers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think this is such an important message. Remember that your not alone in this world. There are people that care. #SuicideAwareness #SuicidePrevention #suicide #MentalHealthAwareness #mentalhealth #MentalHealthMatters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThenJoSaid @hotpatoooties What's funny about that is. It's how stereotypical gay guys speak to woman and to each other. I think these men have been watching to much family guy or American dad. Ps I hate it it's so over the too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DearMrAtheist Yes but you know people like that. It's like what my mother used to say to me about swearing, and still does even though I'm 31, "Do as I say, not what I do" very frustrating words<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jack_Septic_Eye I do but thanks for the tip though 😅 I thought everyone did<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You want to know why there is so much stuff going on because there is no vaccine yet that's why. Maybe I dunno donate some of that fortune you have to help? Just an idea Mr president @realDonaldTrump  #COVID2019 #coronavirus #CoronavirusOutbreak #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DearMrAtheist There are so many to choose from already though 😅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes people please can we be more like more Bob?  #panicbuyinguk #COVID2019 #coronavirus #CoronavirusOutbreak #COVID19  https://t.co/RUKoJFnSxl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this people is the guy you have as the president of America. I mean I know we have trump light in @BorisJohnson and will probably go down the same tragic, sexist, racist and homophobic road as the trump idiots have gone but still. Why someone tell me why #UKPolitics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am not from America but I know that America does affect the rest of country with change. Things do need to change. Your totally right @BernieSanders tell me what you plan to do change things. This isn't me calling you out I am genuinely interested. It will take time I know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This goes out too all my #LGBTQ family. I will love and support you because guess what I am part of the family and I will help build you up and not tear you down which I have seen some people do. We should #support each other with in the community #LGBTQProud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ratillathehun I used to binge eat them probably why am fat now. Kinda sounds like you want to just buy out the shop contents lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes! This should totally be the way. I bet it won't be though because we know how those greedy corps like to work. But 💯 agree this let's hope it works out this way. Won't hold my breath though.  #COVID2019 #coronavirus #CoronavirusOutbreak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ratillathehun Now that I could get behind. Pot noodles are awesome but just leave some for the rest of us who can't stock pile though 😅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This sounds about right for the British public 😅 to be fair I think Australia are doing the same thing but still. Makes you wonder doesn't it!  #panicbuyinguk #COVID2019 #CoronavirusOutbreak #coronavirus  https://t.co/FfO8J1B694<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScotCuthbertson Me too. A friend of mine had to go to give different super markets to find toilet roll. How pathetic is that. Took her all day just get an item that should be well stocked but no people being idiots<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why I look at humanity and shake my head. Why do people do this can some one just explain it to me please?  #panicbuyinguk #COVID2019 #coronavirus #CoronavirusOutbreak  https://t.co/ykh6GYLpPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This whole #panicbuyinguk thing is getting out of control. I would love to know why people are stocking up so much? What's the point of it? 2 me it just makes the country look like idiots. But what are your thoughts on the situation?  #COVID2019 #coronavirus #CoronavirusOutbreak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>💯 agree this #panicbuyinguk #COVID2019 #CoronavirusOutbreak  #coronavirus  https://t.co/8Fxoku77BA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CartoonsThatShouldReturn let me see here. Well I think the old sonic ones should because they were amazing as a sonic fan and also danger mouse, inspector gadget, thunder cats, and the old Pokémon series should do it justice too. Your thoughts?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Didn't know there was such a thing as a #NationalNappingDay 😅 well that's me everyday. I always love to take naps. What about you guys?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@royalxnerd I totally agree there we are but hey at least it shows the mindset of the nation now. No wonder people laugh at us when you have things like this happen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharlieSimeon Wow just wow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetroOpinion @MetroUK This is just ridiculous to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beautybytamib Ok I am no make up expert here but ain't you supposed to use a foundation that, I dunno, matches your own skin tone? I know drag queens do this but that's part of the act and they use like 3-5 different shades of foundation. Am I missing something? Some one help me out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am all for this. It would make life so much easier for people if it was taught in schools. What are you thoughts?  Call for all schools to teach sign language 'to make world more inclusive'  https://t.co/xsHzygkKuZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I totally agree here. While yes I am an advocate for mental health and I will try my best to help anyone with a mental health illness. I won't have people use their mental health as an excuse for bad behaviour. Guess what some of us just get on with it. Gd days and bad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScotCuthbertson I am sad the last thing I watched on Netflix was the their version of the first Pokémon movie. Mewtwo strikes back. Good animation on it tbf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AtlanticFyoo I am sure you got a shock out if it lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dconama Savage! 😅😅😅 I love it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robcog1992 That's just called age my friend lol I do it all the time and most the time and I don't need a blanket I can just be sitting there and boom 3 hours have gone haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And yet I have also read that 44,000 people have recovered from the virus. How come your not reporting on that? How come thats not getting the heat that this is. Oh yeah that's right because big greedy people can't profit from it and spread fear. #COVIDー19 #coronvirusuk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Catfishing is never ok and Sherry Pie should known better. This is why the LGBT community gets such a bad name with guys like this doing crap like this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congrats to @taylorswift13 I am not usually one for music but I do like this song. She is an inspiration to many people and the way she does this is through her music so a huge congrats to her. Keep on doing it Taylor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For those people #panickbuying food and toiletries I just thought you might want to bare this mind too lol  https://t.co/EGV2LLnPLP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This makes me sick. How dare someone do this to another person. This racism pure and simple and it needs to stop. This is all thanks to the media making it into a panic. The virus can be carried by anyone regardless of race so people need to stop this kind of crap #coronvirusuk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see the hashtag #panickbuying buying is trending on twitter. I am guessing who ever came up with clearly got an F in their English exams in school. Its Panic not Panick people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emrazz @raehanbobby I have a best friend who I have known for years. She has helped through so many rough patches in my life. Seen relationships come and go. Seen me laugh through the good times and cry through the bad times and picked me up right back up again. @KezbyJ  will always be my friend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@touchmelovely This is just disgusting. I can not believe there are people out there doing and saying this kind of crap. Racism is never ok on any level. Why can't people just respect each other I don't get it. So what your Asian, to me your a person, an individual. This gets on my nerves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KTHopkins And remind me again. How did you get your fame? Oh that's right! Being an over opinionated hag. But hey at least you have a fan base that's just as hate fueled and evil as you are right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeamYouTube @itsangelaa_xo Why bother it's not like your going to do anything to help us YouTubers out. U have your golden people on YouTube, we all see it. It's ok though some of us learned the hard way that our channel is dead lol but please stop abusing the likes of @itsangelaa_xo n the like it's wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT Hold on a second. I volunteer at a mental health charity and I am on the committee for a pride charity and an LGBT support charity. I know how much money is needed to make things happen it ain't easy. Why hasn't this charity done anything in two years? Very suspicious to me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScotCuthbertson It's always a good feeling when the community comes together to show such support for one another. It needs to happen more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am a #TransAlly because I believe that people's identity is just as valid as my own. I am a gay autistic man with learning difficulties and if I can live in this harsh world then why can't a trans person live in this world too. People need to stop the hate and learn to accept<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok I am not a fan of @jamescharles  but this is just mean to him. He is a gay guy who actually does have feelings and you straight guys think it's funny to play this kind of crap and then get upset when he plays you back. Some people need to grow up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I honestly because the reason why this is happening is because the rich can't profit off the virus yet coz they have not found a cure. #COVIDー19 #COVID19 #CoronavirusInSA #CoronaVirusChallenge #Coronavirustruth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey hey everyone. I hope you have all had a good Thursday so far 😊👍😘 Have you been upto anything exciting? Or do you have anything exciting planned for this evening? Let me know in the comments section!  #ThursdayThoughts #ThursdayMotivation #ThursdayWisdom #ThursdayMood  https://t.co/RX2gE4QetE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey So much hatred. Why can't people just let people live. So much negativity in one tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lord_Sugar The last time I saw anything like this I was a young lad lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScotCuthbertson All we can do is be accepting to each other and hopefully one day people will accept us. Never give up hope<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanA____ I'd rather not. I wonder how much he has to pay though lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Tbh I watched your video and even I thought, in this instance, James might have been in the right and that he just might have seen someone else's video. There are thousands of videos an hour being posted on tic-tok<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey @shanedawson It's getting out of hand. I think there have been a few cases here in Britain. And it's spreading to other countries quickly too. So they need to do something about it fast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@space__creature @ThreeDailey @shanedawson Yeah Dr Gerald Robotic  https://t.co/wzapCTErXE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey @TeaTriggerYT But I would look so good in those red horns though lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey @TeaTriggerYT What's The New Tea Order? Is that like a secret society club thing? One sip and your indoctrinated for life lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kodeetyler I would have to say both. The parent should be monitoring what their child is watching and the creator should be mindful when making child friendly content. If it's not child friendly then they should put the age restrictions on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@misto404 @ThreeDailey @PaigeChristieUK Yeah I agree there. Maybe this is why my YouTube channel doesn't get anywhere. I tend to just say what I feel at the time. But isn't that the whole point of YouTube though. Authentic personalities. Maybe I am just reaching though but that's what I look for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@misto404 @ThreeDailey @PaigeChristieUK Yeah but that's part of the fun lol one day your everyone's hero the next your the devil himself. I prefer the devil side at least that way no one expects anything from you. Go out in a puff of pink smoke or something camp and cheerful lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey @PaigeChristieUK Then let's bring those days back. Don't take life so seriously. Be the community you guys want it to be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love this statement. Always be true to who you are. Forget the haters because at the end of the day. Only you are the one who has the power of your own body/ mind<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey You shouldn't be sorry for saying that. They do deserve it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Totally agree 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well this is a very British thing to do 😅😅😅  https://t.co/5rICC80gSx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😅😅😅😅😅  https://t.co/JIZGn09hLb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DearMrAtheist Oh we all know he is a cult leader and also know that YouTube is protecting him too (my opinion) because it's funny how the guy has been known to be a sexual predator but magically nothing has been done really. He still uploads and posts. The main should be in jail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScotCuthbertson You try to educate them no that's not ok so they can use their stupid holybooks to corrupt and destroy young people's lives. That's ok. Why don't they actually get educated on the lessons instead of spouting this hateful crap like they do. No wonder kids feel they have no where<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScotCuthbertson This stuff really gets on my nerves. Clearly they have not read the material been given out at schools because then they would know it's not sexualising at all. Also so it's ok for their little toe rags to go to church and learn that being LGBT is sinful and wrong but the minute<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JJDodders It takes a lot to just tweet this out so that's the first step. The road to helping us feel ok is never easy and if you never feel like you need to talk my DMs are always open. You never have to feel alone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey guys and girls<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey twitter. How are you all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaSpillYT So he managed to make a mukbang video while apologising? What ever happened to just apologising you know just saying sorry with out all the crap in between. Or am I just old at 31 now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shanedawson Life not laugh dam auto correct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shanedawson Your beautiful just the way you are Shane and don't let anyone like this get to you. Just keep living your best laugh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your mental well being is do important always remember that. Never face things on your own.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenKlinePoet Oh I wish I knew that too. I think it's that whole they trying to fill with money. They are trying feel the empty feeling they have<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenKlinePoet I think your answered your own question my friend. They are never satisfied that's why. They will never be happy because they are always looking to get more money than they already have. It's just greed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey The bit that confuses me about it all is. She contact her parents only after she got in the cross fire. Would she have got in contact with them and been has emotional as she is now if she had been put through the coals? Would she be doing all this if she hasn't been caught<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching @SonicMovie at @vuecinemas<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's ironic that now they want to talk about mental health. Yet some of us do it all year round and have been doing it for years. It's a so sad what happened to Caroline but it's funny how it's taken her death to start this conversation. Why not years ago for those who suffer?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Caroline Flack, The pressures of the press!  https://t.co/XkQuteusP8  https://t.co/jjnDT0rWva<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If your voice reaches just one person then that's enough. That one person then doesn't feel alone. They feel value. No one should suffer alone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You are not alone!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seidlermaxy This resonated with me lol it's fun being invisible on social media. No one really notices you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow just wow. I can't say this enough. This woman has the platform she does she for what? To spread this kind of crap to other woman<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do this most days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey everyone. You all having a good afternoon?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates You got this cold bug that's going round too. I have had it for just over a week now and it's driving me nuts lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates I am doing good thanks. How are you doing today?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An attention seeking gay guy with a god complex. Ground breaking stuff. So whens the next one going to pop up then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anyone have this card. It would help me out a lot. Thank you in advance. #coinmaster #coinmasterofficial  https://t.co/C26ulz56Ai<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey hey people. How are you all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This just blows my mind how people try to pass bills like these in 2020. Yet again people are trying to control how people live or how they love. Don't they all just piss off to an island with backwards thinking then   https://t.co/fH9ri4ASFx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ghostlicker I feel on this one. I could have an IV drip with coffee in it and still not feel like it is enough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey people. How are you all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We should all lift each other up. The whole LGBT community needs to work on supporting each other more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaymerChat You will be waiting forever for that to happen you know lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey guys I thought say that I have been thinking today that I need to work on my channel and work on some editing stuff. I know that this isn't ideal because I said I would upload everyday but I feel that my content isn't the way I want it. Thank for your patience<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@itsangelaa_xo This seems to be happening a lot to you lately. I wonder why YouTube is doing this. Although in comparison it doesn't push small channels like mine anymore. It feels like they only care about the massive channels now and that's it<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I so want this cake. It looks sickly but so delicious at the same time. My body would hate me afterwards though I bet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Sounds like a great day 😎<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FaceJaclyns Your probably right. There is just something off about her about her body language and the fact she can't look in the camera. She knows she is lying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Happy Sunday to you too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@New_YouTubers Whisper of a thought.   https://t.co/bmHEqWJWKN<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@spillseshYT Na mines working fine. Still telling me I am a crap YouTuber 😅😅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FaceJaclyns Is it just me or she is having a really hard time keeping eye contact. As someone who looks at more than just people's words. I look at how someone carries themselves too. She is hiding something I bet ya.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wheresnicktoday @BowdyBear Sounds about right it's why how they get to be popular. By being ruthless to the rest of the world and being focused on outer beauty constantly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@New_YouTubers 7th<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gazpen @CalumMcSwiggan Thank you finally someone else has said it. I have to take three medications a day and I am concerned about what will happen. I have mentioned it before but been told to shut up and stop moaning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaSpillYT Did I miss something? I thought people knew some influencers had no morals. Once the fame hits all they see  💰 and then the morals are out of the window<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MonopolyPhonic Holly wood corruption where basically she was forced to change everything about herself to fit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthSleuthYT Wait my mind is blown at this. They do know your content right?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TubeTeaYT Is he serious? He can't use the gay card. I am gay and not into sorts but guess what I knew he was because it's all over the news. It's all over social media. I can't believe he went there and then tried to come back with I'm gay that's why. How disrespectful<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hey twitter people. How are you all? I hope your all having a relaxing Sunday? 😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leerichards182 It's going well thank you 😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey people how are you all? Having a fabulous Saturday I hope x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DearMrAtheist Poetry, general other forms of writing, blogs (although I am lacking on it), YouTube videos (again lacking on them). A few ideas flow alot daily.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey hey guys. I hope you have all had a great day. Me? I have spent the day watching @DearMrAtheist on #youtube. Makes me think about how I should structure my own channel.  https://t.co/ZfsBDJHXR1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doesn't she look so adorable when she is asleep ❤️🐈🐱❤️  #adorable #CuteCat #cute #CatsOfTwitter #catlovers  https://t.co/gz2gufwOLc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey hey people. I hope your all doing well? I know I haven't posted in awhile but you knew I wouldn't stay silent for long lol #TuesdayMotivation #TuesdayThoughts #tuesdayvibes #tueaday #TuesdayWisdom #tuesdaypost #tuesdayfeeling  https://t.co/fR5dBOuyTU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsangelaa_xo I have to shower every day because of a skin condition called kiloid scarring which is all over chest, shoulders, back and arms so I have to other wise I am agony with them. I get some people can't shower every day but for me I have too otherwise I am in pain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScotCuthbertson I have to point this out but the community is lgbT not lgb the T part is a part of the community why can't people accept that. What's so hard for them to understand. Trans people deserve as much rights as the other parts of the community do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sebas_williams @TruthSleuthYT Transphobic for one and two erm she said she doesn't wish to spread hate in the last one but before she literally listed everything she finds wrong with Nikki which is a form of hate and negativity. Does someone want to explain to her how hate works.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JudeHoward21 @DearMrAtheist I get that yeah. I struggled with my sexuality as a teen it's not an easy thing to go through. I do, however, thanks to modern day society know &amp; help out with a local charity that helps young lgbt youths with being free to express who they are. Still a long to go though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What kind of crap is this? #SeduceSomeoneIn4Words  are being serious @YouTube?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DearMrAtheist I'll just leave this video here   https://t.co/nFrUXzpHeL To all the lovely 'haters" in the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DearMrAtheist A sexuality test? Hummmm so I wonder one I will come under ragging homo or..... As if I could be anything else lol I wonder who comes up with these tests? Ps also those relationship articles on how they should be to be successful total crap. Next!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😅😅😅 next they will be saying the TV series house of cards was a totally American concept. Nope sorry it was British first. So was shameless too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YouTuber Nikki Tutorials comes out as a Trans gender woman. What a power and inspiring message she gives not just to other trans people in the community but to everyone everywhere. You are You and labels shouldn't hold you back from loving who you are.   https://t.co/Q62fPkRZfY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kibbled Well I can't see the lie in this statement<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsangelaa_xo It's kinda in the title. It's almost like they can't read or something lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just watched @ThreeDailey video. Omg Ashley really getting pretty over an unfollow how over dramatic. I am not even sure if my own boyf follows me on here or even on Insta. He doesn't like my shit on FB either. Guess what I don't cry over it. I'm an adult &amp; it's social media<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is excellent news. Love is love 🏳️‍🌈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stand together for our trans brothers and sisters. They need our support in the community!  #LGBTQ #LGBTQoftwitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MNaylor_ Excellent 😅😅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kodeerants I got so pissed off and heated reading his replies. I kept on thinking this can't be real. Someone can't be that stupid to think these words and activily say them to the world and the I found out it's a fake account. Ps he goes on saying the N word in his tweets also. Total scum<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Queenie72927611 @queenmagdarl I really wasn't going to comment but really Queen. This is Jessica because the account was made this month and is only following the Jessica so if your going to try it at least make it look believable. And lastly you type just like a gay man. Darling? Princess? Come on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouisePentland Totally 100% agree xxv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alwxysyouhslwt I was to about to say something but then I got to the end and was like "yep you got me there" 😅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheAcademy I'll host it for ya pmsl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChipMunkLove21 @ThreeDailey I have shared for you. I hope you find your mom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robcog1992 I would send you coffee but I love coffee that much I might accidently forget to send you the coffee and just drink myself coz I ain't a morning person either lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GlamLifeGuru It is a lovely thought. Now all I need to do is make my day happen. Lets make 2020 our year guys and girls.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well turns out I haven't put any weight on which is good, bad sign is I haven't lost any either so better look next week #slimmingworld #weightlossjourney<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well will soon be off to #slimmingworld to see how much weight I have put on lol I lost last week but I don't think I will be so lucky this week though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>100% agree. It's all about who has the bigger D to the power hungry morons up top. Well I hope they are happy when they have blood on their hands<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_ClaireRichards Just ignore then Hun. The only time anyone really comments on anything I do on here is to start an argument with me for an opinion I have. No can say anything nice anymore. I looked at the previous tweets and you had valid points they just wanted to argue with you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@instagram They are certainly interesting I will give you that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can push yourself harder than you realise. Go for those goals this year. But I can not stress this enough start with the small tasks that will lead up to the big goals don't go head long straight for the huge goal. #lifegoals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know I don't promote this as much as I should do but I am a publish author and I am very proud of it. I am working of Poems from an Aspie Vol 2 so keep your eyes open for it. In the mean time please go and purchase Vol 1 from the link below:    https://t.co/d6DYZLDHtK  https://t.co/mdGPdeP79Q<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So after years of using it I think I have finally worked out how to add something things to my #WordPress site to make it more me. I just hope it translates well on websites because I am doing it all on mobile lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always remember you have the potential to be anything you want to be<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ViscountLe8ton And this is why I don't do festivals lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You deserve to be happy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Drama makes influence. That's how scandal makes people famous. I am guessing this person didn't get the memo that's how fame works these days<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheGigiGorgeous How did you manage to make snow ball fighting look beautiful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who the hell wrote this crap. I mean come on my 2 year old niece can do better. I think it's time #JustinBieber finally gave up now. This isn't music take me back to the 80s/90s now that was music. #justinbieberisoverparty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's so sad to see things like this happening. I have the up most respect for those people on the front line. You are amazing people. #AustralianWildFires #AustraliaBurns #bushfires #prayersforaustralia #PrayForRain #wildfires<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoralDeVille I just didn't like his attitude. He gave me arrogant vibes and I can't stand people like that. I have seen a load of men and woman fall for him because of his body and I am like why? He sounds like an idiot. Personality wins out for me. Rant over<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReadytoglareYT And it's his business because?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Words to live by<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisprestage He has a cold and wants the attention lol it's called man flu. I get man flu but I guess my attention is different, I want to be wrapped in my duvet with ice cream and chocolate and to be left alone. But hey each to their own he wants works attention when he has a cold lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DearMrAtheist Who is for the chopping block this time then lol, girl defined, transformed wife, Mrs Midwest, Paul and Morgan or maybe it's someone even more radical than them. Can't wait to see<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaSpillYT Oh no! They are reproducing again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tyduroll Just looking through your profile it looks you want world war three? Also while your quick to tweet at some random person the internet how about you go fight in actual war instead of playing call of duty coz its nothing like playing a video game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's happening Australia right now breaks my heart ☹️😢. Its disgusting how all people are #Trending now is things like #WorldWarThree #TrumpsWar and #IranWar well really the trend should be #PrayForAustralia but no let's talk about war instead. How dare you all do this. 😡😡<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>"I'll save you jack......" Nope epic fail lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well this is how little sleep I had last night so as you can imagine I am shattered right now, this is what being pain and in hospital gets you. How did you guys sleep last night? Good I hope. #sleeptracker #sleeppattern #sleepcycle #Fitbit #fitbitversa #fitbitsleeptracker  https://t.co/9e0nLk4aJN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am getting to go home a bit later on. Yay back home to my own surroundings. Even if I am in a lot of pain. It might help ease me. You never know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey hey people. How are you all? I hope you all have a wonderful Saturday! #SaturdayThoughts #SaturdayMotivation #SaturdayVibes #saturdaymood #saturdaypost #SaturdayMorning #saturday  https://t.co/EGHtXsXhsH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are they serious not even close  I got 67!!  https://t.co/qtEuPNy7ff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know I need a shave but it's like almost 2am here and I can't sleep because I am in too much pain to sleep. How's everyone doing if your up? Ps I'm on codeine, paracetamol and oramorph and I'm still in agony. So this is fun lol #hospital #Newcastle  https://t.co/1hicjL0Dzo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Wait does he mean "mad" as in angry or "mad" as in crazy. Coz if it's the crazy one then bitch I'm there lol I've always been mad as a hatter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dalehay I imagine you caused all sorts of trouble lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beings as I don't think I will be getting any sleep tonight. I thought I would show last nights sleep as I have just remembered lol. How well did you guys sleep last night? Good I hope. #sleeppattern #sleeptracker #Fitbit #fitbitsleeptracker #fitbitversa  https://t.co/CRXSuWNkTL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey @sebas_williams @NikkieTutorials I am not the only person who has wondered this then. It's been bugging me for a while but how can a little timer like me question a big timer like that. I would have the stans after me if I did. Or at least that's what is my head<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER What kind of statement is that for them to make. Plus it's very homophoic too. They are the bullies. Pay them no attention nick. You know who you are<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@munchkin68 I am usually in pain with the scaring on my chest, shoulders and back but this is some next level stuff. This is what I get for trying something new lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well just a little up date. They are keeping me in over night due to the amount of pain killers I am and believe me they ain't even working lol I am on three different ones and morphine and I am still in agony. This is torment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey hey people how are you all? What is everyone up to on this freezing cold Friday? It's operation day for me so I am just waiting for it. Go to love that waiting time. #FridayMotivation #FridayThoughts #fridaymorning #FridayMood #fridaypost #Friday  https://t.co/ELb46qyVu1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichLux713 The more respond the more people will come back at you. The best thing to do is just to ignore it all. It will all blow over in a day or two<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TwatOnision @TeaByAli @YouTube I feel like this is the dark side of YouTube and it doesn't look good. At one point I wanted to come on to the platform to make a difference. To help people who are like me but I doubt I will ever be able to do that with people like this who manage to get away so much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well my sleep last was fun lol  Sleep is fundamental in helping with #mentalhealth and yet I bet your like me and you don't have a good sleeping pattern. Am I right? How well did you sleep last night? Does it affect your moods like it does me #sleeptracker #fitbit  https://t.co/H0UY3vWj5B<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I fully support @PaigeChristieUK in this 100% you need to sort this out @YouTube, @SusanWojcicki or @TeamYouTube who ever is running things there because this is just one of the reason why I don't post anymore. It's crap like this. The system is disgusting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gadgetbeat30 I know I do not know you. But I am so very sorry to hear this. Sending you love and support<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or Lilith. Mother of all demons. Queen of hell lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey @E_RIDE387 Remind me again why it's their business what you do in your private life. If your on Grindr, your on Grindr and in other news the sun rises and sets. I don't see what the point is here. It's your business not mine or anyone elses. Some people need to get a life I swear<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey you wonder people! How are you all? I hope your all having a brilliant Thursday. Anything good planned? Me I'll be off to Newcastle ready for an op tomorrow. #ThursdayThoughts #ThursdayMorning #ThursdayWisdom #ThursdayMotivation #thursdayvibes #thursdaypost #Thursday  https://t.co/IIhLZKv5D1<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheCrownNetflix  season 3 is Amazon. The minors episode was such an emotional one but all of them where out standing. #TheCrownNetflix #thecrownseason3 #TheCrownS3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Omg is that bad for her. I mean I know she took a hit earlier in the week but dam it keeps on coming by the looks of it. Well like I said she shouldn't pretend to a mental advocate when she clearly isn't one. The shame and lack of respect. Deserves it if you ask me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey hey people 😊 how are you all today? I hope your all having a relaxing Sunday? Let me know what you have planned 😎  #SundayMorning #SundayMotivation #SundayThoughts #SundayFunday #sundaypost #Sunday  https://t.co/0WMhEePb34<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Hey hey Dan 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good night Twitter. I hope you all sleep well 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@noah_nonsense Actually a lot of the Christian beliefs come from pagan origins which include yule. Why do you think things like Yule tidings is included in Christmas. I did my research, I think you should do yours<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always remember that you can speak how you want. This is whats called freedom of speech<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well actually if you want to be real, Christmas is all fake lol even your Christian beliefs of it. Pagans and Yule is the real definition of it. So sorry your argument of this offends baby Jesus is crap. Coz you stole it anyway lol do ur research   https://t.co/CEzSDOYvAz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"possible hate crime" are they serious. It was a hate crime plain and simple. No two words about it. This is why gay people are afraid to be who they are in public and why things like pride exists because of vile creatures who do these kinds of things.   https://t.co/zpKTcNaRyS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well I almost got the recommended 8 hours sleep. I never seem to get that at all. What's interesting is that my REM sleep is always low too. The most sleep I get is light sleep. How well do you sleep? #sleepy #sleeptracker #Fitbit #fitbitversa  https://t.co/BEwyPlddU9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey hey people. How are you all today? I hope your all having a fantastic Friday?  #FridayThoughts #FridayFeeling #FridayVibes #FridayMotivation #Friday  https://t.co/P99BlXXU5j<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER @OleHenriksen @jamescharles His skin is great due to make up and face tune. Just like every other "artist" out there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey twitter 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ouch this one hits a little too close lol mental health blog ☑️ Pokémon fan ☑️ LGBT charity ☑️ also if you wanted to add to that I also help a mental health charity so ☑️ for that too and I have only just turned 30 lol although I don't Stan anything sorry fellow gays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@djanthro Happy almost Friday to you too 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey guys and gals. How are you all? Hope your are all having a great Thursday so far 😎  #ThursdayThoughts #ThursdayMotivation #thursdayvibes #Thursday  https://t.co/nctrM699bW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey twitter 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey And what makes this even worse that she was still friends with Jessie when this said. I just watched @itsangelaa_xo video where it points to them being friends at this time. So wow I can't believe it. My tweet on Gabbie earlier stands even more now. Shocked someone would do this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TransDayofRememberance #translivesmatter #transgender #LGBT #TransRightsAreHumanRights #lgbtqtwitter #lgbtqandproud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Transgender day of rememberance  https://t.co/ja7F6iB1jC  https://t.co/nmpeneVYq5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You was born to stand out. So go forth and be who you was meant to be. A King/ Queen with the powerful voice that will shape the future #quote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates See I just voice my opinion anyway lol the only thing I try not to is politics coz I know that will get me probably canceled on here lol but other than that I am always voicing my opinion which is why I don't have they many followers #loner<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stewnotstu @pjay_100 A chocolate hobnob is my kinda queen lol I would soon be getting a packet myself to munch down with her lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RalfLittle @RichieJH When did he ever tell the truth lol it's like the Tory policy not to tell the truth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kodeerants I thought that was the whole point of a drama channel. Was to report on the drama that's happening, the name kinda gives away lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Well I guess that's what happens when you try to manipulate people, people start to see straight through after awhile<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have tried to keep out of the @GabbieHanna drama but I can't. As someone who is a "Real" mental advocate. She has made us all look terrible with her actions. You do not go into a fans dm's &amp; start harrasing them 2 manipulate them 2 ur narritive. It's out of order. Makes me mad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What planet is this woman on. The @Conservatives have ruined this country from the start. I don't normally speak on political matters but it's getting beyond a joke now #GetTheToriesOut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey Twitter people I hope your all good? Any exciting plans for today?  #WednesdayThoughts #WednesdayMotivation #WednesdayWisdom #WednesdayVibes #Wednesday  https://t.co/nYIhQdyKE7<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hey twitter people 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FaceJaclyns She said what! 😠 How dare she try 2 use PTSD. We all know why, so people will feel sorry 4 her, she uses the mental health card. Sorry Jaclyn doesn't work. I know people who have real PTSD &amp; real mental health issues so girl bye. Ps im always here people if u need to talk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReadytoglareYT I am shocked someone who is an advocate for mental health would do something to someone. I mean I am advocate for mental health and I will continue to do so but how can people do the vital work when you have stupid idiots like her doing this shit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaSpillYT I think I would win 1,2 and 4 lol but 3 I might have a struggle with as I can't put make up on to save my life lol<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I know I look like hell but I haven't actually posted a picture of myself in awhile so here it is lol confidence is a big thing with me.

<|startoftext|>This bloody weather, at Drayton manor and I am already soaked through and freezing cold ❄️🤧 and it's still pouring it down ☔💧 got to love the British weather.... Not #cold #britishweather #DraytonManor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning Twitter 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a conspiracy with in a conspiracy 😂😂 I think you need to check to see if Jeffree or Shane has voodoo dolls<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well I made it to Birmingham safe and sound. Now let's see what trouble I can get into 😂😅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sebas_williams Is Cole a clone of James or is James a clone of Cole or are both a clone of Kim Kardashian? Now that's something to think about lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best reaction ever! PERIOD!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well finally on my travels to the south of the UK lol my home town. I may be a northern boy now but I will never forget my southern roots 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone is crashing @JeffreeStar website for the #shanexjefree collection and here is me at a train station waiting because it's delayed lol I would buy everyone they have if I wasn't a broke ass gay 😂😂 well done to both @shanedawson and Jeffree for a mega launch 💜💜💜<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always remember you are worth everything! Don't let anyone dim you light<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WispaRs @PaigeChristieUK Oh of course I forgot you was there wasn't you 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaigeChristieUK Oh don't worry hunni the last time I did weed I puked every where too. If I remember correctly it was all in my shoes the next day lol oooops<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is everyone doing? Good I hope?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey twitter people 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always know that you are worthy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good night everyone I hope you all sleep well 😘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see the point of this. Accept me at every stage but it looks just vile though. It looks like the guy is fat shaming . But then again the gay community is best known for fat shaming and shaming those with mental health issues. So probably right actually #stopshaming #selflove<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is very true<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your mental health story is just that YOUR story. Don't let anyone try to undermine you or the pain that you feel. It's your own emotions to feel and no one can take that away from you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Y'all want to know what depression feels like! It's me right now. I'm sat with full on tears, feeling like crap, feeling like I am going to have a panic attack. I have no idea why. I was feeling fine hour ago &amp; boom this happens. This is my depression #reallife #depression<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look people @ThreeDailey  is doing an apology video pmsl 😂😂  I'm kidding go check it out he brings up some excellent pints about both videos of the #ShanexJeffree series<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A message for all of you if your feeling a little low right now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fresitamilk @itsangelaa_xo Yep me too, which is why find it so funny when I see Christians try to preach because erm they do realise a lot of their traditions are just rip off pagan ones lol bless them for trying though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER Good morning sunshine lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What they have made is amazing ❤️❤️ #ShanexJeffree<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait a second a guy with the handle beauty in it came for another guy with the handled beauty in it too lol so beauty dissed beauty 😅😅 this is why the beauty community is so toxic. Y'all are bitching on each other like a bunch of school kids lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neilcarvey It's your choice what you do. Sod what other people think. It's your life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Truth 100%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just finished watching the new episode of the  #jeffreestarxshanedawson  series. Even though I am not dog person I teared up at the part where his dogs got sick. On a lighter note that packaging &amp; the whole pallette looks amazing shame I can't afford any of it lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's James Charles of course he is protected. He can't do any wrong according to the big boss of the platform even though he is just a big baby &amp; can't take it when people call him out for being a huge brat!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good Morning Twitter 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good night Twitter💤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarlenaStell Not that I am aware of so far, but if you want to follow me then you know I won't complain 😅😅 I am just kidding I haven't seen anything as of yet Hun<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShinyBubble2 @TeaByAli Yeah I agree which is why haven't uploaded at all on my channel in like a month. I have been debating on if or not to come back to it. From a mental health point of view &amp; give people hope that you can live a life with mental health issues but I don't know yet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's an great look &amp; all &amp; I would have been ultra impressed but sorry you didn't give credit to Abby Roberts who came up with the original look. So it went from a 9 to a 5. Sorry hun just my honest opinion give credit where it is due.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Luke_Egg19 Good night 💤 sleep well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fabulous last words hun! You know these bitches be out here testing you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry but that's got to be the best chat up line I have heard in awhile 10/10 for effort on her part. Good for you girl 😅😅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSimonC90 The magnificent lunch box. Oh how boring is mine lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sdellag They do now if you went in with that top darling lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh sweety that's the right is my every day life and during a party lol there is no good side lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamescharles  #jamescharles #CancelCulture #overparty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KristofAdamson Nope I am exactly the same way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaByAli I am excited to see what he is going on about though. I am thinking its what I have said though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaByAli It protects and promotes it's elite creators and sidelines everyone else for example the Jaclyn Hills, James Charles, Allfie Dyes, all them lot. They protect them and promote them all over YouTube and leave the rest of us to fend for ourselves. Am I wrong?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This LGB - Alliance group is not an Alliance at all. I will stand with my Trans family &amp; I will support their identities. They are people &amp; they should be shown respect just like they show us respect. We are all 1 LGBT+ community &amp; we must band together as 1 #LGBTQ #LGBT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congrats 😍 the only way is up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hold on! Your now coming for the drag community, oh girl come on are you running out of ideas of what community you want to be. The beauty community thinks your a joke, the gaming community thinks your joke, so now it's the drag community. 😂😂😂 I just can't anymore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dustin is on the case 😅😅 watch out I hear he is now a king of the drama channels according to his ancestors 😉 @ThreeDailey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaByAli killing as always. Go give her video a watch guys!   https://t.co/4UQdooaANY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is such a powerful message! 😘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate a rammed bus. It brings out my anxiety 😟 am I the only one who gets like this? I mean I can feel my own my body starting to panic!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How's everyone day going so far then? Keeping out trouble I hope 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaByAli Yeah I have been watching how Tati handled things and she handled really well. But then again I am pretty biased I'll have to admit I do love Tati and her videos lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have rushed out the house without my wallet. Thank god for #GooglePay lol means I can 1- get to places and 2- buy the stuff I need and 3- which is most importantly I can get some food. Ps I am running late as usual lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaByAli I can see what she was trying to do. Feed into cancel culture but in my opinion it flopped because of how many people she has wronged. Now if say Dustin wore an outfit like that I would find it comical and I could see the point in it. Like she was trying to do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates How are you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good Morning how are you all? You ready to face the day? 😀  I know I am. What do you lovely people have planned for today? Let me know down below!  #goodmorningbritain #TuesdayThoughts #TuesdayMorning #morning #goodmorning  https://t.co/kskxA3SCOV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never give up! You are worth every moment on this earth and you are loved by so many people even if you don't feel it. #selfcare #selflove #lovewhoyouare #BeYou<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Drink that tea sis 😁 love it!  @PettyPaige247  https://t.co/YpvKZTYO2N<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@canuck883 This is where I would fail in the industry coz I don't see the point in bringing each other down. The designing of the make up n the make up itself interests me, I mean if anything can make my face look gd then I'm all for it lol. But it's toxic I see. Why? The people maybe now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PettyPaige247 What they do this time? I swear that family can't stay out drama<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@canuck883 I sure did that's I so annoyed and made my point. Although I don't see him clapping back at Kamm like he has me lol funny that...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning Twitter 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cohlsworld And your telling me because....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh pls ur only doing this coz of the #jeffreestarxshanedawson episode that came out last night where Morgan's story was told. When u have been told as many times as I have that ur worthless by ppl n u won't go no where then come talk to me. Ur doing this for attention Girl bye 👋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Good morning 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And yes I am someone who is constantly looking at Instagram male models and thinking I wished I looked like them n getting emotional because I know I never will. Pleasures have scars and being fat lol one I can change the other I can't. But u got to get on with it though n smile<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just finished watching the #ShanexJeffree YouTube video! Some interesting tea right there about influencers. The shade of them having work done and stuff. I bet they do too lol I mean we all knew it but now it's just been confirmed. It's all fake 😅😅😅 thanks guys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarlenaStell @netflix Careful Hun I can hear a certain "brat" getting all vexed lol. Good for you love that's a proud moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Your so right Dustin. People have too much time on their hands. I mean so do I but you know I'm a dim wit so cant really follow what the hell is going on anyways lol always remember your worth more than them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty much the plot for twilight lol don't @ me you know it's truth  https://t.co/DLXJaBcm55<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Oooh sounds exciting 😀 I bet you have a lot planned<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This has killed me 😅😅😅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jenyockney @Vitt2tsnoc Your taking 17.4 million people out of the equation if you join up to this website remember 😅 coz that's all they keep on banging on about<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScotCuthbertson "homophoic trash place"? Is that how you say it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theJeremyVine @marthakelner Is it wrong I just wanted him to fall lol I'm evil I know. But he looks like a tool though. Look at me I have to have attention type.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER She looks like the ugly one. Physical beauty fades but being ugly on the inside lasts forever. I wish people would look on the inside and work on their own struggles instead of projecting their own jealousy on to others<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PettyPaige247 So let me get this right. This woman promotes body positivity for being a plus size woman (which is fine btw don't have an issue with that) but then also body shames other woman for being plus size? From what I have seen. Is that right? I feel like I'm losing brain cells here lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Nice what you got anything good planned with your time off?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Then you get to go home and relax 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chibikuma83 Would I be classed as a "coffee gay". Finally a group I can be a part of lol with the amount of coffee I drink I could be one of the top ones lol. On a serious note na it doesn't bother my system anymore I think I am used to it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates I am good sweety enjoying my second coffee 😀 you upto much?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SureThingMedia @indelight Oooh sounds interesting I'll have to go and check them out 😀 can't beat a good breakfast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#goodmorningfriends well it's #MondayMorning 😊 I hope you all are having your #morning dose #Coffee like I am ☕ We all know it is needed first thing in morning right?  Let me know how you guys take your coffee? In the comment section below. Me? Milk with 3 sweeteners. 😁  https://t.co/xiOkYehZaQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning Twitter 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Morning 😀 how are you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@canuck883 @GlowingBeauty01 @TeaByAli @itsNICKSNIDER I feel the same Tabitha lol we just want to hang with the cool kids lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ooooh did he find his crayons!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@T_IsForTom @MermaidMinge I can feel this tweet in my soul 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSimonC90 And that right there is what you call entitlement. So what if you have followers. The manager didn't ask you to promote the hotel so what's the issue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PineCreekPoet Well that's alright then 😁 if it was me I would be freezing. I am right now and I have jeans and socks on haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@djanthro Happy Sunday to you too 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Being friends with people is a good thing. Take your time finding the right partner it will happen when it is right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Elstro1988 You wouldn't be the first to do it 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PineCreekPoet Don't you get cold 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER Just reply with "ok Regina calm down" lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edgar_a_bitch @arancaytar @huwlemmey @Stephanenny The HORDE shall rise 😃 lol. On a serious note because this stuff is getting on my nerves a lot. Why can't people just be respectful of how people want to live, what happened to love wins, that also includes people loving themselves too not just others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey What have I told you Dustin. Stop taking photos of me before I have my coffee 😂😂. Seriously though no one and I mean no one should use that word. I think it's a degrading word. It's the same as someone saying faggot I hate that word too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Epic song 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScotCuthbertson So very true. An ally is someone who approves of both trans and gay. I had a massive debate with both a straight person and a gay guy who just didn't get that trans identity and gay indentity are the same thing. Trying to explain it was hard work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shadowaerian Good morning to you too 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PointlessSte I think he has an issue not you. I think you looked great. I wish I had the confidence to rock that look lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Wouldn't shock me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ByrneBook Sorry to hear your not having a great morning. I hope it improves. Always remember it can get better 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteHolderness Good good glad to hear it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteHolderness I am good thanks. How are you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteHolderness Morning 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning Twitter 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteHolderness I bet everyone sings that in their heads now lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@allegedlyangelo @AustinMcbroom @CatherinePaiz So they thought it would be ok to say that a child is rating their seductive Halloween costume? Who in the right mind thinks that's ok? I guess they got some major backlash so they changed it. But guess what the internet is forever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarlStark Well you look very smart<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KaylaChowShow You rebel 😄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@furious_coops Lol someone really said that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarlStark Nothing wrong with glasses lol you look very dashing 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only person who can bring out the beauty in you. Is you. So shine bright people. As Rihanna would say "like a diamond"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteHolderness Nice to know someone believes me 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kodeerants @Pornhub You know it sis 😅😅😅😅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This such a mood 😅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScotCuthbertson Exactly. We need to stand with our trans family and support them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kodeerants James Charles clone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Why is he so invested in what people do in private? Another person who is using religion to try and control people. Girl bye! Religion will never control the mass population so stop trying 😂😂 we are more aware now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xkrdx @TeaByAli This is my thought when I saw the tweet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteHolderness I caught out in the rain yesterday here. I am hoping it's easier on me today lol I don't wish to get soaked again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteHolderness Yeah I am all good. You upto much today?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteHolderness Morning 😀 how are you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good Morning World 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamescharles stop being such a drama queen just get some shampoo and conditioner that contains some Aloe Vera in it. Yeah it will strip all the dye out but it will give your hair some life back. I had to do it coz I dyed my hair so much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GlamLifeGuru  I wish I could do make up and I wasn't poor ☹️ otherwise I would buy your gorgeous looking pallette hunni ❤️❤️ xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How's it going people?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's ok just look on Instagram and steal a look. It's not like you haven't done it before right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaByAli She wants a "penis to make dating easier" what the hell. Trust me girl having a penis doesn't make dating easier. Does she want to be a man for the right reasons is the question here. I won't knock her if this is real but if it's for clout then dam she is being cruel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Oh dear. Do I need to run for cover Dustin is about to break the internet again 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaByAli You could talk about me and how much of a mess I am 😂😂😂 wait no I am irrelevant so nope that's never going to happen pmsl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteHolderness Anytime X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey @itsNICKSNIDER It's the foundation of a good friendship lol if you heard some of the things me and my best friend call each other you would thing we hated each other lol nope it's called friendship love lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteHolderness Happy birthday Pete. I hope you have a fabulous day!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey twitter people 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER As an adult with autism this is horrible to see. I was bullied in school for being in what was known as the special needs part of the school. Not to this extreme though. It needs to stop. Both the bullies and their parents need to be taught a lesson. This isn't acceptable at all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamskiJonDicky Awwww cute<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Savage 😂💀👻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's pretty awesome work there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@transscribe @ScotCuthbertson Ok if they want trans people to have ID cards, then gay, bi, lesbian, and straight people have to have ID cards too. Shouldn't single out one group of people. They should show some respect for how people feel. I hate what they are trying to do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey twitter people 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScotCuthbertson Here here 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Hey Dustin 😊 how are you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can I go as @JeffreeStar for Halloween and have all the business sense he does to go along with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaByAli Just get some Jet, Black Onyx or Smokey Quartz crystals and place them round your house or have them in your pocket. Should sort that negative energy right out 😀 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kodeerants I never have watched her material but I have watched people commenting on it so I have seen bits of shows. There is a narritive she is trying to paint and I know she has a message to get out but she is going about it the wrong way IMO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FaceJaclyns And your all acting shocked. The only person Jaclyn cares about is herself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Some people are just cruel. You don't need that kind of negative energy around you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey twitter people 😀 how are you all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People really "canceling" @ThreeDailey for burning some sage. Really? This is what ur all mad over?. Please I burn incense and carry crystals with me all the time. I mean come on there are more important things you could be mad over<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bello_Kevy Yep I have to agree totally<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER Oh savage reply nick lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates All the apps are like they hunni. I know I met my fella on growlr but we met as friends first and it developed into a relationship. I think the apps are useless to find love.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get his dick wet 😂🎵 got to love a bit of Amy Winehouse #music #SONG #tunes  https://t.co/AYeOIjOSCE<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bello_Kevy The only issue is if your proper drunk then you don't remember it the morning after lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jwing1791 I see posts like this all the time on here &amp; Instagram. A lot of the times it doesn't bother me but every now &amp; then I feel a little down hearted because I will never be able to feel as confident as he does. Having massive scars &amp; being over weight is an issue. Hey ho though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScotCuthbertson It sure did 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScotCuthbertson I do love the beauty of Edinburgh. I was up there the other day for the day. The hills on the other hand kill me off lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey twitter land 😎<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hope you guys are ready for some drunken mess photos, lives and tweets lol I am in Birmingham for the weekend and it always ends in alcohol lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaByAli Goody bags at the door. Yay...... Yep just another set of mouldy lipsticks. But hey at least this time it's free crap<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning people of twitter 😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning ❤️❤️❤️  How is everyone?  Any interesting plans?  Me! I am off to a meeting to sort out some podcasts which is going to be very exciting.  Let me know in the comment section below what your plans are…  https://t.co/eBBLp6nHIj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doesnt a certain influencer  *coughs @jamescharles* use this filter. If you threw a bone would he fetch because dam he saw is quick enough to jump on the latest drama. "Go get it boy, go get that latest drama" 😅😅😅😅 #jamescharles #FunniestTweets  https://t.co/165srJo7eg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not knowing which way to turn!  https://t.co/355N5Ro92E<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3 whole years this special guy has stood by me. Through the many tantrums I have had, through the strange outbursts &amp; through the 🤪 moments. The ❤️ &amp; care he has shown me has proven that he is a true 💎 &amp; I wouldn't change him for the 🌍.  HAPPY ANNIVERSARY BABY I LOVE YOU  https://t.co/jNsbapkSCF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey I have never watched David's videos so I can't comment on his but I have been watching Shane's latest series and I have to say his is amazing content. It's well put together and enjoyable to watch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey @fiverr Hey 😊<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MakeupMom2 @shanedawson @JeffreeStar I think @JeffreeStar website and customer service team might actually have a meltdown lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey I found a clip of you, @RichLux713 and @itsNICKSNIDER  you shady queen's lol  https://t.co/hcKgoVAhOH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaSpillYT It's a no from me but I think James will look my buddy squirtle when Shane and Jeffree release their Pallette coz sorry princess you will finally be irrelevant.  https://t.co/08As2gKg0o<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kodeerants I teared up it was a moving moment. And proposed over text to my fiance lol I know highly romantic. In my defence I was totally drunk off my ass 😅😅😅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamescharles reveals a mini version on the same day @JeffreeStar and @shanedawson release their video going through the shades of their pallette and what's to come... Ok 😅😅 Girl you do know that's not smart right? I mean really who does your business for you lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey @KEEMSTAR Remind me how the likes of EastEnders, Corrie and Emerdale still air on TV? When you have this drama popping off every 5 seconds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lily33259306 @shanedawson I know us UK people have it hard lol we have to wait till night time to watch it lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bitangler Being uneducated is a choice.  Being totally wrong is a choice  Having this stupid OPINION is s choice<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TeaByAli Well first off they are trying to get through to Jaclyn Hill so this level off stupid doesn't surprise me at all. I mean how can people still back her after the whole lipstick thing<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IndieGates How are you doing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Good morning 😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER 😅😅😅😅😅 this made me laugh. He is really trying it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey I am sorry to hear it Dustin. I know you have plenty of people round you. But know that I am here if you need a extra person to chat too. Sending hugs and support<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well I am year older lol I have decided I am not aging I am leveling up. So instead of being age 31. I'm level 31 it sounds way cooler 😂😎  #birthday #over30 #gettingold #Libra<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Check out the latest issue of Alphabet Soup 🏳️‍🌈 this issue includes a review of Cumbria Pride 2019, information on self-harm in the LGBT+ community &amp; where you can get help, &amp; in the spotlight in this issue is gynosexual &amp; androsexual.🏳️‍🌈   https://t.co/aMp0pIaQ5F  @OutreachCumbria  https://t.co/MzeqHMKDxu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey So let me get this right. They started recording because she pissed on a stick? Ps if that stick glows like that I think she needs another kind of test. I'm called area 51. The Ace family need taking back to their home planet of stupidville<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TooFaced Oh get lost. Those false lashes clearly. If your going to promote a product then use just said product stop with this whole fake crap to make the product out to be better than it actually is. I'm calling it on this one. False lashes plain and simple like most<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trishapaytas Trisha hun I know you like doing things  2 be dramatic &amp; I think it's part of ur act but sis this just ain't it. You have gone too far. I usually don't comment on things u do coz I know no 1 will listen but please drop &amp; take this down. It's disrespectful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patrickstarrr @TeaByAli This angers me. Usually I just ignore Trisha and what she does but this has gone too far<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justcallhermom And this is what is wrong with the gay community. You look fabulous fella. He was an obvious user and not worth your time. Gay men need to start to think with brains and not with that dicks for once. It's all about sex. Rant over. Don't let it get you down<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaByAli I know I am probably out of line here. I mean she can indentify as what she wants. But as someone who helps the trans community this is kinda damaging. If she is doing this to raise awareness then good but I don't think she is. Ps the rewired soul can fuck off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey @itsNICKSNIDER  https://t.co/rkWCyRl8gQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kodeerants Oh I could go an a rant here about how I am pagan and I balance myself with nature all the time and to on to explain how but I feel like this dude wouldn't get it. I also have multiple mental well-being issues so this statement is untrue. Some people need to do research I think<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning you lovely people. How is everyone? Are you all ready for another week? 😀  #MondayMotivation #MondayMorning #mondaythoughts #goodmorning  https://t.co/5m3ew2wS4p<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Green_Footballs @kasthomas Him waking up should be one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nymakeup_hair @glow_smokey I will be the first to say that I am not fully informed. But I speak from my personal experiences and I try to give people the best advice I can. He doesn't have the right to comment. I know first hand like I say that it does affect behaviour. I am here if you need any to talk to<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER Good morning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Used for views and clicks. Mental health is a serious matter and I hope people realise that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have just watched this video by @glow_smokey on the rewired soul and I had to leave this comment because, as the cool kids would say, I was triggered by it. The guy is not and will never be a metal health professional. It's not trendy or meant to be 1/2   https://t.co/oAESEgxFfr  https://t.co/eblrJgyXvL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey But if I am a mess in real life just like am online lol do I just go as homo lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaSpillYT They want to try living in the UK and having mental health issue where the system fails you and wants to see you on the streets or dead. I literally see my bf work his ass off to keep this house going n I feel degraded cos I am unable to do anything. These people piss me off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reading the comment section on this makes me so sad. Why are they being made to wait so long. Oh yes I know because the greedy people in our government is too busy with Brexit and lining their own pockets with money to help the NHS fund essential stuff like that. It needs to stop<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ant_917 I thought Glastonbury already happened this year?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Support of #MentalHealthAwareness within the #LGBTQ community is really needed IMO. We must stand together to help those who need it. #MentalHealthMatters #support #mentalhealth #LGBT #beyourself  https://t.co/uSnIsy8xvs<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PaigeChristieUK I can't either girl so it's all good 😂😂😂😂😂 and apperently I can't form sentences properly either from what I typed in regards to the threat of that tweet lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER I meant to put "not even petty Paige's picture" dam me trying to type quick lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER Not to point out the obvious. But I am going too because clearly some people are missing it. But that's even petty Paige's picture on I am guessing that's YouTube. And yes I did just check. So this can't be the real petty Paige<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Timmy_G123 That's totally vile. What's got to do with him who or how you got hiv from. It's personal to you. He should be trying to understand better and also see you as a person. Your diagnosis doesn't define who you are. Your Tim and this guy is a total tosser for his actions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Face, bothered, look, bothered, no, thank you 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is what I want to change. This is why I want to work with organisations such as @OutreachCumbria  to help young people. To let them know they are not alone. They don't need to be afraid. We are a community and we need to come together to stop this from happening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Good night. I am just getting up here in the UK lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning Twitter people 😀 how are you all? #goodmorning #GoodMorningWorld #SaturdayMorning #SaturdayVibes #SaturdayThoughts #morning<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER Omg seriously this is going to too far now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshlyeKyle @TeamYouTube Did you mentioned James Charles at all in your videos? You know once you mentioned him your videos that you get picked on by @YouTube  because they are protecting him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarlStark It wouldn't surprise to be honest. Any publicity is good publicity as they. She sounds like a bottom feeder if she doing this just to get a reaction though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarlStark The comment section to the tweet is why I love twitter at times. I bet she didn't think people would have such good come backs to her homophoic attack<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@the_lee_foster @itsNICKSNIDER @antphrodite Final destination 1 and 2 where awesome films lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Laura88Lee Non I can't do horror movies lol now give me mean girls, devil wears Prada, gossip girl or sex and the city and I'm there lol I also love a few other great shows. But horror movies and rv shows na I can't do them. Yes I am boring I know lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well went to @SlimmingWorld and I have put on 1/2 a pound which isn't too bad but it has made me want to start to do more to lose it lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kodeerants Oh the good times<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shanedawson @JeffreeStar @AndrewSiwicki @Ryland_Adams @_morganadams_ @hashtagcatie I can't wait for this. It's going to be interesting to see into the life of one of the top beauty gurus going. I think that's what Shane wanted to do. I know James will be mentioned but I don't think in great detail. It's from Jeffrees point on it I think<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning Twitter 😀 how are you all? #goodmorningbritain #GoodMorningWorld #WednesdayThoughts #wednesdaymorning #Hello #HEY_GUYS #hey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaryBethWylie Wait wait wait! This idiot is trying to give people advice on not going to a professional? Is that what he said. Can some please just clarify that for me? Coz I am beyond pissed off if he has just said that<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TeaByAli @spillseshYT One day YouTube will be called out and all of them arrested for this shit. Well that's the hope. I am shocked by this. Yeah I use YouTube as s platform myself. But this stuff makes me question using it at times because it's sick. They promote this shit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@messymarkk That poor dog will be neglected once he realizes that it won't up his popularity like he thinks it will<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@repeattofade @tinymilks 3 hours I spent in there the other day I wanted to kill my mother and friend but hey at least I got a free meal out of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickygervais I always thought most medicines came from plants so do they need to take the horns of rhinos is so confusing to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaByAli Seriously even I can see that's preswatched and I know absolutely nothing about make up. I think they need to up their game lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your well being is very important. Please take care of yourself and make sure that you feel good with who you are. If you need to take some time for you, then take that time.  #selfcare #Wellbeing #MentalHealthMatters #mentalhealth #YouMatter #TakeCare<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Remember guys and gals you don't have to suffer alone. Your mental health is the most important thing you need to look after. Please don't face your problems alone because that's society has taught us. People are here to help. #mentalhealth #MentalHealthMatters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is everyone's evening going?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@djanthro Whisperofat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you guys &amp; gals haven't been to check my latest three videos why not?  Go check them out!  18 yr old going Blind after eating crisps and chocolate.   https://t.co/7x3jfmQmCn  Dani Chon is 13! I'm disgusted!   https://t.co/a1xfmeQY2A Why I haven't posted!   https://t.co/C4BUNonwwu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER how dare someone bring someone's recovery process. They do realise that keeping sober tales a lot of mental energy..... More than what they are capable of otherwise they wouldn't make such horrible statements. I hate society at times. Your sober life is your story no one else's<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey @YouTube I think I might have a heart attack due to the shock of it. They listened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning people 😀 how are you all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KaylaChowShow Omg 😂😂😂😂 that's got to win picture of the year lol good on him for capturing it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffreeStar I'm ready for you to spill it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best clap back ever and so very true lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER Pretty much yeah. I said my thoughts directly to her on the tweet. Not that that she will take a blind bit of notice but hey ho at least I tried lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be proud to wear yours people. It's not about shutting one group down over the other. Its about the LGBT community being to feel safe in the NHS. That's all this means.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ULTRAGLOSS You will be waiting a long time. I wish there to be peace in the world but it's just not realistic though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER But then how does the likes of James Charles, Manny MUA, Alfie Dayes, Zoe Sugg, all have the jobs they do now? It all started with them "working" with YouTube. So there for YouTube is a job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now that's some fierce looks right there 😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusanWojcicki @YouTube How about you stop making changes to things that don't need fixing. Also how about giving people the platform they want instead of giving into greed and money. How about that. And stop promoting and pushing the creators you want too down our throats. Time to make some big changes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your #mentalhealth is very important just as much as your physical health. You should take just as much as care of well being as you do a broken bone. Never forget your never alone. There is plenty of help out there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey @itsNICKSNIDER It's queen puffs to them. God do they not realise us gays rule the internet lol<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KEEMSTAR @SusanWojcicki Hate to tell you Keem star but not all channels had their verification badges taken. It's so patheric they are promoting channels like James and it's so transparent too.

<|startoftext|>@Dan_Brocklebank Yeah but it ain't going to change though it's only going to get worse lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning people 😀 how are you all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamCvind Wouldn't we all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER So do you want to tell him that James Charles is still verified as a creator on YouTube nick or shall we just let him figure that one for himself and watch the fire works go off?  https://t.co/W46upJoav9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you remember when you joined Twitter? I do! #MyTwitterAnniversary  https://t.co/fncNPoGoF0<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Don't forget it us content creators who made you and it us content creators who can break you too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow that's funny. Manny MUA hasn't had verification check taken away nor James Charles. Come on @TeamYouTube if your going to do it everyone then do it to EVERYONE! now because influencers won't stand for this shit much longer. One day your sight will be shut down by us  https://t.co/ljlIIERFMi<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey @itsNICKSNIDER 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So all the haters going after @RichLux713 you all ignoring this video huh? guess you all just want to spin your own narritive to get some clout on the internet. Makes sense coz your all reaching for something for attention    https://t.co/W3iDrCsXab<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some come on then @YouTube when are you going to fix this #LGBTQ issue? When are you going to allow us to have the platform we deserve to talk openly about the LGBTQ community to help young people? Stop thinking about money all the time and give us back the YOU in YouTube<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MillaXander @TeaByAli @YouTube That's because he is their token Gay. As long they have him they can say they support LGBT+ when reality they don't. They actually are Discriminating and last time I checked that's against the law so soon they could find themselves in very hot water.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey don't forget to go check out my two latest videos. I joined #slimmingworld   https://t.co/DWj1rEvXmE  #jamescharles suing #WetNWild  https://t.co/QttHsDvmrJ  #newvideos coming very soon so keep your eyes open for them.  #Youtuber #YouTube #subscribe #youtubechannel<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The blaze sisters are town to show these bitches how it's done. Ria and Kia are the badass bitches 😂😀  https://t.co/KDPAsdlbFU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshlyeKyle She lost me half way through that piece of trash she calls an apology. So, she uses religion and also the fact that she is young? She can done one. If your raised properly then that behaviour wouldn't even enter your brain. I never have done anything like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDylansWorld @New_YouTubers  https://t.co/bmHEqWJWKN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning people 😀<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Too true this is so very important<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Birmingham here I come 😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsangelaa_xo Dam right. These "big" influencers think they are above everyone when they are not. Some people need a reality check<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates You look very smart Dan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaigeChristieUK Always appreciate the hard work you put into your videos. They are a joy to watch<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER Omg people must be that bored lol I mean I know I have life but Jesus man this guy takes it to a whole new level lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaSpillYT I'll say it then, don't be a shady bitch James and then not expect a reaction. You thrive on drama it's who you are so don't pretend to the world that you wanted to stay out of it now. Ps I fully believe you was talking about Emma and now your trying cover your tracks point blank<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaymerChat Sending you hugs. You will be happy again one day. It takes time to find your happy place again. But you will find it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Why when there are so many horrific things already out there and plus we already know a clown lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaByAli Wow some people take things to the next level<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YTConnected @KodyMcHugh  https://t.co/bmHEqWJWKN  Just a total mess on the internet come a long for the ride guys lol<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheDylansWorld @New_YouTubers  https://t.co/bmHEqWJWKN  Just a small time creator on the platform making a total mess of things as I go lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KaylaChowShow Listening to Nickelback will be cheaper trust me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GlamLifeGuru Yikes! Even I know that's bad fashion and I am hopeless at the latest fashion trends<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok here is some tea, maybe nothing but I just clocked that Jeffree unfollowed Tati on Instagram. Hummmmm interesting. I wonder that's all about<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaigeChristieUK @TheRangeUK 😂😂 oh he clocked you real quick girl. Now get in there and but some goodies lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kodeerants I think it's time for James Charles to be done now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaByAli Omg 😱 that's horrible I hope she is alright in the end<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaigeChristieUK 😂😂 love it Paige<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoutubeCommuni3 @ImNuttty  https://t.co/bmHEqWJWKN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshlyeKyle You know what's funny. I have made videos on James, made tweets and even tweeted at him and he hasn't blocked me. I mean I know I am tiny channel with next to no subs but still you would think he would have blocked me by now but nope lol what a dumb ass<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning people 😎 how are you all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good night people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ColeCarrigann So Cole when are you releasing the Morphe callab pallette then 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey I have just seen him try to pull of wearing that dress. I mean really. Broke ass show girl. If he wanted to be a drag queen then he needs to do it properly for god sales doesn't he have a whole team behind him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaByAli 😂😂😂😂😂 is this brat still being a bitch lol bye sister should make a come back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂😂😂😂😂 I'm dead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexapaniccia_ @teapot_yt My crystals need cleansing. I know there is a full moon coming up soon so I might cleanse them then. They could use the extra energy boost<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ColeCarrigann Hi James 😂😂😂😂 oh the shade of it all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TenfoldZite @TenfoldEsports @xXBuggyFreshXx @HungryHxg @TheMetalToaster @TheZtemperR @Raviinatrix @RhxdyO @ThatBoyLuxiee @Cody_TGM @SupStreamers @SmallStreamersC @SmallStreamersR Congrats mate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My little Morgana was adorable once lol  https://t.co/KdEgrqoSAf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey You captured me perfectly 😂😂😂 if only I was that good with make up lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Thanks so much for reaching out 😀👍 means a lot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Thanks Dustin I think I needed someone to tell me that. The issue I have is that I am such a perfectionist and everything has to be so perfect that I forget this is just meant to be for fun and I can just mess around on YouTube and try out different things if I want too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@New_YouTubers  https://t.co/bmHEqWJWKN  Please come and subscribe guys. I am a small youtuber who chats, rants and makes videos about just about anything that pops in to my head lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey That's the hope when I put out my videos but I think I am getting too involved in the numbers. I see people gaining the high numbers and then there is little old me not doing much lol maybe it will come with time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey I'm struggling with this whole niche thing on my channel of late. YouTube is a space for people to express themselves I think but what if you have a lot to express how does that work out?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hayxsmith I have gotten the same reaction when I mention that I am autistic. People can be so vile.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know when you want to tweet what's really on your mind but you don't want people to know exactly the issue is. Yeah I am in that state right now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am sorry guys there will be no YouTube video today I am not feeling to good and plus feeling like a failure too so yeah just need to rethink some things<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Teasquad? Is that like the sistersquad, totally irrelevant and totally cringe worthy to watch? Or am I missing a step here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaByAli WTF. I hate to tell these people but being ugly on the inside means you look ugly outside too. Beauty is an illusion, it's whats on the inside that counts. Ignore them hunni. You know your worth and they hate that your living your best life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaryBethWylie I tried doing drama coverage but I don't think it's working out for me and my channel lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning Twitter people 😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good night people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER Oh you know it's coming, it's the typical response lately. Everyone is blaming drama channels instead of looking on the mirror<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Lol if she can't couldn't handle it then she should have not dished it out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichLux713 Dam stuff is about to get real<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaByAli From what I have seen this woman has gotten to everyone she mentioned. You guys shouldn't let her. She is just being a pain and looking for clout and views.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Truth 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaByAli "you gotta look a certain way to argue with me" what kind of a statement is that. Clearly someone things on their outward appearance too much. Beauty comes within doesn't anybody teach these idiots anything these days. Beauty isnt skin deep people. It comes from within<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichLux713 Ignore her she isn't worth it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you guys haven't already please go check out my latest two video on my @youtube channel   @jamescharles suing @wetnwildbeauty? My own opinion!   https://t.co/QttHsDvmrJ   I joined @SlimmingWorld   https://t.co/DWj1rEvXmE   #ATSocialMedia #YouTube #Youtuber #youtubechannel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>About to play @DevilMayCry 5 lol let's kill some demons<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/bmHEqWslmd  Ok I need some @youtube advice now guys. Should I start include gaming into this channel or make whole new channel for the gaming side?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@New_YouTubers  https://t.co/bmHEqWslmd  I actually need some advice guys. Should I start to include some gaming into my channel or make a whole new channel for the gaming side?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bello_Kevy Where you planning lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaByAli @itsNICKSNIDER @ThreeDailey I agree there if it's abusive, which I have got on my channel and YouTube has filter for me I think, then that's fine. But like you say I think those comments are just people disagreeing with her because heaven forbid people have a different opinion. I encourage people I do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaByAli @itsNICKSNIDER @ThreeDailey I don't get why people delete comments. I mean it's engagement at the end of the day plus it also shows your audience how you handle those comments too. I have negative comments one of my videos it shows how I handle it. Some people just want to look like sunshine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER She seems really bitter maybe because she isn't pulling in the views like you guys are. I mean come on even her title is click bait she doesn't actually give reasons as to why you guys shouldn't be trusted she just goes off on why she doesn't like you guys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Number #048 #venonat #crossstitch made with the #crossstitchworldapp 😎😃👍  https://t.co/CdrbxwKSSX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@depressionnote @leerichards182 Mental health is so important. We need to break the stigma around it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Saczak1 I wish I was rich lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaByAli @JeffreeStar @PRAY4THEWlCKED I'm not on the pay roll lol but then again my content sucks haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pink You are a legend. Sending love your way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How's everyone's day going so far then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bello_Kevy That's so adorable. I haven't even thought of the kind of wedding me and my fella want yet and been engaged for two years lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoutubeCommuni3 @DventuresHu  https://t.co/bmHEqWJWKN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouisePentland I love this quote ♥️😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you guys haven't already please go check out my latest two video on my @youtube channel   @jamescharles suing @wetnwildbeauty? My own opinion!   https://t.co/QttHsDvmrJ   I joined @SlimmingWorld   https://t.co/DWj1rEvXmE   #ATSocialMedia #YouTube #Youtuber #youtubechannel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bello_Kevy I used to do it all the time. Then I got the piss ripped out of me by everyone so I don't anymore. I used to love playing with different colours<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaSpillYT I didn't but I guess there is a YouTube video for everything lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning Twitter people 😀 how are you all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is my worst nightmare. You just want to hope that the self centered personalities don't match<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaByAli Take your time and rest up. You need to get well before thinking of doing a video<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheYTForum Too true<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bello_Kevy I tweeted last night lol first I knew about was last night. They kept well under wraps. Either that or I wasn't paying attention<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER 😂😂😂😂😂 it'd not gagging up if the idiot keeps on being a twat on the internet lol. If he was a decent human being then a lot of people wouldn't come for him online. Sorry if people don't like the facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So let me get this straight you had the mess between "the brat' and @wetnwildbeauty yesterday and now another cosmetics brand is actually stealing from @JeffreeStar  today. Ooooooh me thinks this irrelevant cosmetics brand is trying to be clever and get some press<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaByAli Ok I could totally be a bitch right but I won't<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bello_Kevy No I spilled them all over the floor 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaigeChristieUK Mine too back in the day lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaByAli I say "hey guys" all the time. This kinda makes me feel bad for doing it. Should I not say something that I have been doing for years or keep doing it? It's a good question<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaigeChristieUK I think I sum him best. James "the brat" Charles because he behaves like a child<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteHolderness Good night Pete x<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TeaByAli Phew I did the video and then thought about just this second about asking lol like an idiot. I hope I covered it well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope you don't mind @TeaByAli that I used as a reference in my latest video in regards to this James Charles and Wet n Wild drama.   https://t.co/QttHsDvmrJ  https://t.co/MRB4nNP7R7<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>First video of 2.  James Charles suing Wet and Wild Beauty? My own opinion!    https://t.co/QttHsDvmrJ   @YouTube @New_YouTubers @YTCreators @SmallYoutube @MeetNewYoutube @scribly_online @TheYTForum @YoutubeCommuni3 @YTConnected @Suppoman1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There will be two videos up today guys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ich_angelo @jamescharles As a gay man myself he gives all of us a bad name because he is a predator just like Tati said in her video back in may. This just confirms all he does is go after straight men all the time. It's sick and wrong. He is making us all look bad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahDearmond @ich_angelo @monicaabeman @jamescharles Sending love and support to your cousin and his husband those times must have been hard for them both to deal with. As a gay man I owe them a lot. It's because of their courage back then is the reason we have the rights we do today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TenfoldZite Well I hope you have a good day mate. Man I don't miss my school days lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning Twitter people. How are you all doing? 😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@susansreviews1 @MeetNewYoutube Thank you 😎👍 I subbed back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeetNewYoutube  https://t.co/bmHEqWJWKN I am just a weirdo here on the internet 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaByAli I don't think you was. Now if I did a video on the subject I would be classed as one because I just wouldn't be able to hold back in being a bitch about it lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoutubeCommuni3 Me. I either gain some or lose which I don't understand. I am finding so hard to gain an audience.   https://t.co/bmHEqWJWKN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Margolndigo @wetnwildbeauty Even I know that's how collabs work. Now if owned his own brand, say like Jeffree does, then yeah he would have to go to the labs and everything and make sure it's all formulated correctly because that's his brand not Collab lol but hey don't let me stop them from being stans lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Margolndigo @wetnwildbeauty This is just killing me lol I love how the stans of James Charles are going on lol they do know that he didn't actually invent the formula right lol that's why is a Collab Morphe would have shown him colours n maybe some formulas and he picked one lol that's how it works. 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaByAli You nailed it on the head Ali<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QANinja2 @TheYTForum @New_YouTubers @YTCreators @SmallYoutube @MeetNewYoutube @YoutubeCommuni3 @YouTube @YTConnected @Suppoman1 Thanks my friend. I was subbed to your channel to. It's great to support and help each others channel grow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ally35114989 @TheYTForum @New_YouTubers @YTCreators @SmallYoutube @MeetNewYoutube @YoutubeCommuni3 @YouTube @YTConnected @Suppoman1 Keep at it my friend it it's taken me years on and off. It's a grind. I just subscribed to your channel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kodeerants But then how will their bran washed stans know what they are doing if they don't post every second of their lives lol they are only pissed off because people with an actual brain don't like them and can see straight through them and they hate it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jaclynhill Espically if it comes out of your big fake mouth am I right Jaclyn. So when are you actually going to tell us all the truth about those mouldy lipsticks? Don't bother blocking me just because you don't want answer the question<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeyGraceffa @jamescharles @NikitaDragun This would have been great if you actually had drama channels on like @ThreeDailey @RichLux713 @itsNICKSNIDER @PaigeChristieUK  etc. Nothing against Nikita. But really James the brat Charles are you kidding. He loves drama he is a narcissistic arrogant child<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The plot thickens lol so @jamescharles  you going to come for everyone who doesn't like your brand and calls you our for copying? No? Didn't think so. get off your high horse and be quite<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey He is acting like a child because the industry isn't bowing down to him anymore. Why do you think he is all over twitch and Minecraft. Because he knows that the beauty community are pretty much done with him and he has to earn money some how and be center of attention<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshlyeKyle Not surprised. The brat can't stand not being center of attention. Text book narcissist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER But plenty of coffee though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER 😂😂😂😂😂 omg are they kidding. Please they children aka brats can't even manage their own lives let alone talk about drama. They cause the shit in their pathetic lives. Complete narcissists if you ask me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Just watched and you covered better than I ever could<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER Loved this video. You always bring your flare to the hot tea<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey I'll be waiting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TenfoldZite See I don't play games on my channel. I did start out that way. I played Pokémon for a little while but then thought I wanted to do something different. I wonder if I could add that into too hmmm it's a thought. I know I didn't realise I had that many followers on here lol<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TeaByAli It's ok. I am not sure if I should cover this James Charles stuff because I will have to my opinion on it and people won't like it lol<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER @RichLux713 @ChannonRose @jamescharles It's a good job I only listen to the 80s and 90s stuff lol means I won't have the pleasure of listening to any crap she brings out, if any, or James for that matter. I prefer my brain cells in tact thanks. I only have a few left as it is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaigeChristieUK They need to get those views lol so they resort to this crap. I don't get it i mean is this entertainment? How?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@meanie_breeze @jamescharles Real mature answer. I do plenty and I don't need an audience to do too thank you very much. Now run along to child of a saviour. Some of us actually are adults<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamescharles You people are so blind, while yeah it's a good thing he has done this. But don't mistake this "act of kindness" for a blatant career move. This is just because his views are down and his reputation is in tatters so this is all just a smoke screen. I can see it. Y can't you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaByAli We all know he is only doing this because people are finally seeing him for the fraud he is and so what better way to gain sympathy and to say "look guys I am a nice person" when really he is still a brat than to pay people off lol<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PaigeChristieUK You and me both. I wish I had pop corn on the house for when this video drops<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have all these creative ideas for make up pallettes, nail polishes, and other cool things even though I can't put make up on my face or anything. Lol so you know if @JeffreeStar @MarlenaStell @MorpheBrushes or any other brands want to hit me. Go for it 😀👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ich_angelo Ooooooh James Charles is going to go into meltdown. If someone catches that tag me in it lol dam I'm in a bitchy mood today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaByAli The Ace family are dimwits I bet they don't even know what a cease and desist is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Erm the dim wit can't claim spill. The company already did that and Paige already exposed them. They even gave their names at the end of their video so what's he chatting about trying to be spill lol. This guy gets on my nerves.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NelllyTait I have to agree with you on that one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now it's about time @YouTube cleaned up the other issues that we have all said to them. You will never be a streaming service like @NetflixUK. It's call YOUtube so give us, the creators and viewers, what we asked for. A service we can rely on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaigeChristieUK Oh I my niece is 2 and I remember her teething starting. Just take each day as it comes Hun<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>No one gives a shit. He ruined this country and his ex party his continuing to do so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsangelaa_xo She has snapped. Want to know what the difference is between T-series and Spill though? And I will say I don't care. Yes they are both companies but I am willing to bet AWED corp is protected by YouTube and/ or is paying them. That's why Spill is being secretly sub to ppl<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JeffreeStar I love this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gaytimesmag @johnlancia1 This is brilliant news 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsangelaa_xo This will get swept under the rug by the big bosses at YouTube because this trash family just like most them are protected by YouTube that's how and why they get away with scandals like this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ditzkoff @TheSimonC90 Omg already a Simpson meme that didn't take long<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SelfieMadeBoy Your work place must really suck then<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So let me get this right. @ArianaGrande is suing @Forever21 for $10 million dollars because they used a "look a like" in their campaign. I guess those canceled tour dates and having to refund tickets are taking a hit ennit girlfriend pmsl 😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@megzjones Awesome<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kiltheraine @YouTube @itsNICKSNIDER @ThreeDailey @TeaByAli @RichLux713 Agreed. Funny how they are trying to take down other content creators though. Don't they know that's how they remain in business<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey @TeamYouTube Makes you wonder doesn't it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@teapot_yt I'll try not to spill mine 😃<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Southernmommyo3 @YouTube @itsNICKSNIDER @ThreeDailey @TeaByAli @RichLux713 @AshlyeKyle So you shouldn't be what they are doing is totally wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Calling my #Birmingham tweeters let's help this guy out. I some what miss the city so good luck to this young man who is moving there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER A lot of people have done this to me. Then they get all flustered when I bite at them lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Tune 🎵<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey So they are fixing the money aspect to protect advertisers but won't fix the demonstration problem and subbing issues people are having. Ok @YouTube interesting how your making things easier for those who pay you. Lol this is turning into a circus event<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning Twitter 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meravellos @YouTube @itsNICKSNIDER @ThreeDailey @TeaByAli @RichLux713 Totally agree your right it is bullshit. YouTube is trying to force their agenda on everyone and or needs to be stopped<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QueenRuby22 @TeaByAli @YouTube @itsNICKSNIDER @ThreeDailey @RichLux713 Makes things a bit more clear doesn't it. The company that runs spill and then has to be funded by YouTube. Its totally unfair and needs to be stopped<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CassIsWithU @TeaByAli @YouTube @itsNICKSNIDER @ThreeDailey @RichLux713 He manages to end to up on my home page of the YouTube app even though I ain't subbed to him so it's only a matter of time until they do it to me. That's prompted me to check my subs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mechanicalmia @TeaByAli @YouTube @itsNICKSNIDER @ThreeDailey @RichLux713 Totally<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realjosiemuffin @TeaByAli @YouTube @itsNICKSNIDER @ThreeDailey @RichLux713 @PaigeChristieUK It's looking that way. I mean I will continue to post my content because I do my own promotion on here and other social media so hopefully it will take one day..... When I'm in my 60s lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@makeup_flatlays @TeaByAli @YouTube @itsNICKSNIDER @ThreeDailey @RichLux713 Give it a few months then I am sure he will magically be unblocked<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER Because seems to think that we are all stupid and won't notice. Guess what though we did because we do have brain unlike some influencers I could mention<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffreeStar Going to bed shortly lol it's 12.05am here and this bitch needs his beauty sleep<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realjosiemuffin @TeaByAli @YouTube @itsNICKSNIDER @ThreeDailey @RichLux713 @PaigeChristieUK It's a disgrace what they are doing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@teapot_yt Will be waiting awhile. The YouTube algorithm isn't messed up at all. It's been programmed that way to do these things for a reason. YouTube is making a power shift/ play and it needs to do some cleaning of its "house" first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adavgo @itsNICKSNIDER @YouTube @ThreeDailey @TeaByAli @RichLux713 I would just to make sure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@listenup1019 @itsNICKSNIDER @YouTube @ThreeDailey @TeaByAli @RichLux713 YouTube is playing games. I would start to check your subs daily just to make sure you still have them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh wait I'm not done, he is also protected because YT thinks that cos he is gay we wouldn't notice this whole YT is turning against the LGBT community BS but guess what he isn't the poster boy for the LGBT community YouTube. We have noticed as well the shit everywhere else too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another interesting 1 here, care 2 explain @youtube ? No? Ok I'll do it for u. Basically @jamescharles is protected by YouTube because he brings a shit ton of coin &amp; that's all YouTube cares about. Which is y he gets pushed so much on 2 ppl. Coz he makes coin 4 YT @itsNICKSNIDER<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Cash is always s good gift. I usually do it. When they do get presents from me and I don't forget lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@summer_moran @itsNICKSNIDER @YouTube @ThreeDailey @TeaByAli @RichLux713 Money essential. YouTube wants to be Netflix and companies like that so do so they have to get advertiser's and those big people with the money want in on the action. So take away the subs from smaller channels and give them to channels that are run by companies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaByAli @v1ciouzzz @YouTube @itsNICKSNIDER @ThreeDailey @RichLux713 Don't be upset, we can fix it. They can't ignore us all. This just proves that I know who is funding the company behind Spill and it's got to be YouTube. How else can this happen. Randomly being subbed to people. it's all to clear. Be we all have each other. As authentic people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@v1ciouzzz @TeaByAli @YouTube @itsNICKSNIDER @ThreeDailey @RichLux713 Its becoming obvious that it's all fixed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meowpinionated @itsNICKSNIDER @YouTube @ThreeDailey @TeaByAli @RichLux713 I think that's right you know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adams_coraline @itsNICKSNIDER @YouTube @ThreeDailey @TeaByAli @RichLux713 That's the issue we are all facing. I am finding really difficult to get subscribers, one second I get one and then I lose one. I mean it could also be because I suck, I mean it's a 50/50 chance. But it's becoming s problem all over YouTube<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sebas_williams Me because I look gorgeous with a Snapchat filter 😂😂😂 Not. I would have to say @GlamLifeGuru because she has positive energy about her and makes me laugh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GjordyC How come Hun?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@teapot_yt @itsNICKSNIDER @YouTube @ThreeDailey @TeaByAli @RichLux713 Just keep an eye out to be on the safe side. I have never needed to check who I am subbed to before at all but I thought I would check on the off chance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@teapot_yt @itsNICKSNIDER @YouTube @ThreeDailey @TeaByAli @RichLux713 Yeah I would. People have been so focused on who has been deleted but not who has been added<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funny how @YouTube is taking subscribers off people like @itsNICKSNIDER @ThreeDailey @TeaByAli and @RichLux713 but imagine my surprise when I look at my subscribers and look who has been added to mine with out my knowledge. Hummmm interesting.  https://t.co/6eh8hai4sH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok rant time again why the hell is James Charles coming up on my home page when I am not subscribed to him @YouTube ? This shouldn't be any near my feed but some how it is? Care to explain yourselves. Oh wait people if you think that's bad them fixing just wait  https://t.co/t84Qnt9rHX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mark_wootten That will happen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ryan_Bricks How's it working out for ya?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lucashion @jay_been @BorisJohnson Amen to that 😎👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaByAli Green isn't my colour anyway lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't care how this makes me sound it's true he is giving the rest of us in the gay community a huge slap in the face and YouTube is rewarding him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He is literally everything that is wrong with the gay world all rolled into one person. Attention seeking brat. Grow the hell up and start acting like a human being instead of this stereotypical gay moron. .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaByAli I checked my subs. I am still subscribed to ya chick. Got to love YouTube trying to play the game and trying to become a corporation lol it will fail like it has done before<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER @HereForTheTea2 Just means they couldn't handle the discussion being had and wanted to make a statement. Well jokes on them because I don't think you actually care lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey @YouTube This is legit how I have to grow my channel from the ground up because you can bet YouTube won't promote my videos at all so I have to promote my videos the only way I know now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MelanieCmusic True facts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@New_YouTubers  https://t.co/jcMMihbvPj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GlamLifeGuru Good morning sunshine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey The ad is even grammatically incorrect too. So not only are advertiser's tone deaf they also can't spell either. Great work YouTube your doing an amazing job. Remind me why I post my videos on YouTube again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you haven't already seen my new @YouTube video yet. Why not go check it out guys   https://t.co/jzb9syWwsJ   @YTCreators @New_YouTubers  #NewVideoAlert #NewVideo #YouTube #Subscribe #YouTuber #YouTubers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is everyone doing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@New_YouTubers  https://t.co/jzb9syWwsJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER @SusanWojcicki Oh we all know why Nick. Cos YouTube wants to go corp &amp; 2 do so they need 2 keep people like James &amp; Alfie on the platform cos they bring in the most for those ads &amp; that's why Spill was made 2 bring a business 2 the drama side to weed out every1 and take over. It's all about £<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning Twitter 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Do I smell the ever so sweet hint of corruption from YouTube. Hummmm shady<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you haven't already seen my new @YouTube video yet. Why not go check it out guys  @YTCreators @New_YouTubers  #NewVideoAlert #NewVideo #YouTube #Subscribe #YouTuber #YouTubers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsangelaa_xo You know YouTube is going down a dangerous path all these companies doing this now. Soon small content creators, like sad old little me, will phased out altogether. Might need to think of a new platform to post videos on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey And secondly. She has no right to say you have no experience. If she was a true advocate then she would know, as I do, that every single person on this earth has mental health.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Ok so she claims to be a mental health advocate right? (For which I am too just to be clear) she does realise that she literally makes a mockery of herself twice. First off no one who helps with mental health uses the words judge and determine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oopsajamie 🤪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Not if it's a gay man lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Was? Love how he talks in past tense narrative. Compared to how his career should have gone he is pretty much canceled. No past tense needed it's in the present day narritive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theviewersvoice "Trying" being the key word here lol here is a very interesting case study of someone who is literally the manifestation of being insecure and lonely. He has to try and get the attention of everyone because with out what he is. Nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NEW VIDEO ALERT!   Mental Health Series part one: Seizures/ Epilepsy Come check out my latest video guys over on my #youtubechannel    https://t.co/jzb9syWwsJ   #MentalHealthAwareness #mentalhealth #MentalHealthMatters #epilepsy #Awareness #YouTube #Subscribe  https://t.co/XH3PDzUcJd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well you guys a new YouTube video will be coming up this evening so keep your eyes open for it<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER I don't see a problem lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning guys. How are you all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luke_aron135 What time do you start?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER Huge mistake? Nick hunni these bitches entire career is one huge mistake after another. It's hard keeping track<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NikitaDragun We don't have all year bitch. I got shit to do lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leerichards182 Sounds like a perfectly chilled evening 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaigeChristieUK I am starting to hate the way this is heading. People don't seem to understand the full issue here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leerichards182 It's going good thanks and yours?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sebas_williams You know they only do note pages because non of them act for shit and fake cry on camera so they have to look like they mean the apology in another format.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do I make a video of the blog I have just done? I am so nervous about it though because it's about me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In my new blog post I talk about my seizures and why I have them.   https://t.co/4eAXyrrimg  I don't know if I am brave enough to turn into a video series too. Will let you know. Go check it out guys. #MentalHealthAwareness #MentalHealthMatters #blog #mentalhealth #WordPress  https://t.co/Abro0GDvPy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seizures (mental health series)  https://t.co/4eAXyrrimg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know what I think it's time I spoke about the seizures I have. I don't know if I am brave enough to speak about them on video but I might do a blog about them because they do affect me even people don't see it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Anytime always here for ya mate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bello_Kevy I know my channel needs a revamp and the content needs to be thought of more but here is my channel so far.   https://t.co/bmHEqWJWKN  Let me know what you guys think. Would love some honest feed back<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER @MalibuDollFace I can just nitpic for a second I went on to his profile and it says "it's only one of me" if your going to use the saying then say it right. It's meant to go "there is only one of me". I know I am just being a little bitchy but I don't care. That gets on my nerves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER Lol I would love to see someone try to handle you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jhazan Of?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's talk about how social media is built for success, or so that's what i keep being told. Yet all I see the biggest social media influencers being promoted or getting there. It's small timers like me who are just left in the dirt I am sick of it. Time for new blood.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaigeChristieUK First off, ouch my ears are wrecked after this. But got to give them credit to have the balls for doing it. Secondly can I get a pin to crack James fake face lol I mean it looks like it could break and crack at any second. Jesus dude tone down the make up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaSpillYT So James tried to act like a celebrity and flopped what else is new lol I mean the guy is practically dripping desperation lol speaking of when will I be famous 😂😂😂😂 I need that coin pmsl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would so join this lol got to get all the gossip haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Such an iconic picture<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey I hate having to wait in for parcels it drives me nuts. I feel your pain babe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I finally got a hair cut and got rid of the blonde. Went back to my natural colour baby 😀 it took me a little bit to get used it it but yep went back to my natural colour. Let's see how I keep it this way.  #newhair #haircut #newstyle #newme #freshcut  https://t.co/OxBo6CsRqp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Omg the facial expression even with out her sticking out her tongue lol this would be me if I had to take a picture with him. Complete gag reflex lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harbottlegrims1 Congrats guys. here's to the next 23 🎉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Liampcahill Is gay twitter actually a thing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouisePentland Imagine trying to say that after a some vodkas lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaigeChristieUK @Poundland That's true lol hummm see I can't do Poundland if you are. I am still trying to figure out why Tana posted a picture like that lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaigeChristieUK @Poundland And I'll do it with b and m bags lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Now if only YouTube will do the same but get people to watch my videos lol for 100 likes on YouTubers video they plant a tree lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Be thankful dogs don't give death glares because my little witch has become very good at them lol only to me though. The fella doesn't get them half as much as I do lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pringster78 I think my family would have heart attack if I deleted Facebook lol it's the only way they can keep in contact with me lol although lately I am a lot more active on here so I don't know why I need it tbh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey My cat on the window decided to be cute for all of two seconds, then managed to run around like something possessed for half an hour lol got to love animals  https://t.co/ZuJd774gYD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER Why not do both?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Anytime can't wait to see what it is 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER The issue with stans is they will never see the wrong in their idols. They follow them blind. So  I don't think they even realise she called them an ungrapefruit (best line ever lol). They think it's aimed at someone else lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Congrats, you deserve it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning people 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Awwww poor soul I hope he gets better soon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Seriously lol one of the best films around<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DJNSussex Neither am I so we are all good David lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey people how are you all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey The bitch tried and failed..... Next lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSimonC90 Patsy was a legend lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the hell! Another one disrespecting another legend who actually has talent. Stop confusing trash with actually talented people in the industry. This needs to stop now!! #rant #disrespectful #tannamongeau  #myopinion #nochance #vmas #VMAs2019  https://t.co/9mgnLuRb3C<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excuse me! People are saying this looks like P!NK. How dare u lot disrespect someone who actually has talent. He will never ever be on her level. No matter how much he begs &amp; tries to be.  #rant #disrespectful #jamescharles #Pink #myopinion #nochance #vmas #VMAs2019  https://t.co/7d2oUvOzMi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Got to love the internet stars. The word class as totally been lost on some of them lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey you lovely. How are you all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know Spill, Grill and Brew being a company doesn't actually surprise me. I know I am late speaking on this but it doesn't shock me. Money money money. YouTube and the like has to try and steal the money from actual people and how do that. By doing this. So not shocked<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trishapaytas I love these photos you look amazing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey We there is hate there is also love.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Dentists can be horrible. You rest up mate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish certain people had this in mind when they have a huge following but nope they throw it all away for clout and money<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QueerAnswers Done<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaByAli @spillqualitea @ThreeDailey I love that you have done this now they won't be able to steal the work with out giving credit. I don't understand this. Why don't people ever give credit to other creators. I did when I did a video recently. So why can't others. Am I stupid or something for giving credit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaSpillYT Whats happened now? I think I missed the ooop bit. This is why my channel is dead lol I can't make it as a drama fhannel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER Wait wait so this person is picking on someone for not picking on someone in a title of their video. Is that right?... Jesus Christ I feel like I am back in middle school with this shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@New_YouTubers  https://t.co/bmHEqWJWKN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@messymarkk @ArkansasPolice @itsNICKSNIDER I suddenly want to commit a crime lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok this hot needs to do one it's making me to do tired I fell to sleep on the bloody sofa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@i_scotty Well I have to say your looking pretty ok to me 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NikitaDragun I will say what I want to say. I think before I say it. But if I don't say I get more pissed off so I just come out with out anyways. Better to up front than hold things in and let it eat you up inside.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know what I am so sick of seeing people retweeting James Charles ass. It's photoshopped for one and two he just did it for attention so can we now move on to something less tacky please. Ps great roll model isn't he<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Ouch sounds painful man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Yeah I think that sums it up lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey people. So how are you all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So who else is playing #Diablo3 season 18? Currently running round as a demon Hunter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bloody hell it's warm today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey twitter people 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey James d Charles. What's the d stand for? Desperate for attention lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Omg I have just realised that James is the gay version of Kim Kardashian but trashier. The world is doomed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm horrified there are some things you just don't want to see. Scarred for life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Oooooh is Dustin about to destroy someone?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Good morning you lovely people ♥️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are million reasons to give up but all you need is that one reason to carry on and that's the key to life. To have the power to hold to that one thing thats keeping you going on. Never give up hope<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's time you put you first. The time make the choices to make your life better is now. Don't be in fear of what others will think of you. It is your life. Live it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey people how are you all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reflect on what you want in life and then turn those dreams into a reality baby because anything is possible ♥️♥️♥️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey They are amazing. We picked one up for £30 a few months back so they even that much and they do work wonders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QueerAnswers @QuestionLGBTedu Omg they even have YouTube channel too. But of course YouTube won't go anything to them because as of right now they discriminating against LGBT+ people on the platform. I tjin social media is becoming a homophoic place now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey twitter people 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm with you on this one. I loved these shows back in the day<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Pink They just pick on her because she is different and doesn't stick to the status quo that's why. I love them and think people should leave them alone. They wouldn't treat their friends this way so why do they treat them this way. Makes me sick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey I am sure you still be able to get the tea Hun. You know all sister fans will still fill you in all the latest drama lo coz they can't help but posted all over social media<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>😂😂😂😂 accurate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Oh for the love of God not again. I'll say like I say it my videos about it. He is looking for validation from celebrities because he believes that he needs be validated by these people because he of course he fans validation isn't good enough. He is such a child<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trashqueenethan Uh huh and I didn't just go for James Charles in my last video....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jamescharles @elizabethgaba @zoedndr @officialresound So where did you rob this one from? Come on James give credit where it's due. If I can do it in my videos like a big boy adult then you should too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Won't happen because he will hide behind the "I just want to move on" thing as if it never happened. Because we all know he wants the world to forget so he can just go back to scamming fans and collecting coin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey I told you not to sell my soul. Not one wants broken things 😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congrats to you @spillseshYT  can only go up from here 👍 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamescharles  https://t.co/3Bwwr2XwsI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey He just wants all the negative stuff off him so he can go back to his scamming ways. I mean we have all seen him literally steal everything this year and not give credit but if the microscope stops being on him then people won't be checking on him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey 😀👍 nice to we brighten your day up Dustin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow I guess my new video sucks lol you try and put the effort in and it's like YouTube doesn't promote your videos I don't get how this shit works<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ScotCuthbertson I am so nor surprised I knew this was coming and it's only going to get worse. Just wait till they start taking away LGBT and women's rights. Let's go back to the 1950s that's the politics Moto<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER Seriously how old are people. I swear people are losing their shit for no reason so you don't like someone and so what. I guess they haven't seen what I have said about the lord and saviour James Charles then lol<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RichLux713 I could on one serious rant about this and his stupid ass crying video he did on his insta or snap chat but you know I don't people thinking I am horrible lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey @AshlyeKyle @itsNICKSNIDER @RichLux713 @PaigeChristieUK You guys should sue YouTube too. Imagine if the people who are discriminated against game together and filed law suites at the same time YouTube would lose so much advertisement then and money they would have to do something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kourtneykardash @pooshdotcom @chadcveach So let me guess your all about love and family but I bet there is no mention of gay families in there. I know exactly what religious pasters really think of us gay people because have thrown at me no end of times.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey If you have a migraine that stay in bed. You know people will understand if you don't record a video. You need to take care of yourself first before thinking about recording videos<|endoftext|>

Don't come for the gay community because I have news for you. It's your community that's the issue in the world. Stop trying to force your back word views<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JudeBeveridge3 @OutreachCumbria I so wish I could but I am volunteering with Carlisle Eden Mind today. I am looking forward to working with out reach at some point too 😀👍<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Good morning Twitter 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER Not really. It will be a totally fresh start won't it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey I can see why you had to bleep all the LGBT words and stuff out. I think what YouTube is doing is wrong and James Charles should be held accountable I know he isnt the only influencer out there but is the poster boy for them. Great video<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER  video is such an inspiration. Got to keep it 💯 for people to listen.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER Wait this she is still going? I thought she would have thought she would have gone into hiding by now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trixiemattel @LadyGagaKids Oh hunni you will be waiting a looooong time before that happens<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey James Charles is releasing a video tomorrow. So just till then. I am sure there will be a scandal involved. Failing that look at my train wreck of a channel I am sure you could find something I have messed up on lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Well it didn't take long<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Because YouTube is out right targeting the LGBT community but somehow manages to have People like James Charles as their poster boy so we don't notice the blatant discrimination. It's disgusting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey @TeamYouTube Oh you know YouTube will protect their puppet and leave the rest of us to burn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey 😂😂😂😂😂 omg these people really need some new material don't they<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@triscoe iPhones are over rated. I have been an Android user for years and guess what I love the phone I have. I can do so much more with Android. Total snob is what that it is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@triscoe Totally it's best to just block and ignore even though I would love to have my say. It's so easy to explode and have your say on it but then it gives them attention<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 And the point of your tweet was? Oh yeah attention that's right because your just trash. Oooops did I just burst ego bubble sorry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nintendheux Erm he does realise that what his said is why people are pissed off. There is no meat on him that's the issue lol I am a chubby guy so if I said that then it would make sense. Ps your looking good hunter<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@YouTube @TomFrankly You only promote popular YouTubers. The rest of us are left out in the cold. I guess money talks hey YouTube?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Thanos_Leaks @YouTube @TomFrankly @brookehouts Totally agree<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Autism in adults is just as important as autism in kids. Spread positive #AutismAwareness #EndTheStigma<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True words<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now that's the perfect response lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshPescatore @jamescharles About time this happened. He needs to be taken off YouTube. His content violates a lot their polices yet YouTubers likes me never get promoted because I am not good enough. But he does because he can get them money. It's sick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congrats to @JeffreeStar for the amazing @MorpheBrushes Collab. Now if only I could afford them.

<|startoftext|>How are you supposed to promote your stuff on @TubeBuddy when you get a pop that blocks you from seeing anything on the app. How can you introduce your content or channel when this pops up and blocks you?  https://t.co/MAjxNs3Dcz<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DJNSussex  https://t.co/VuWNjydTQ1  I am just going to leave this here. It's in context to this trust me. The class system and the government sucks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenInLDN This person is a moron. I hate the fact people still think being a choice. It's not. We are born this way. Don't people think if wanted we would have it the other way. Our lives would would be so much easier, we wouldn't get abused all the time for a start.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffreeStar I am not surprised with what I saw from your launch party. Your working it hunni. This year has been amazing for you<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You know what yes I am an  #advocate for #AutismAwareness but sometimes it breaks my heart because people, mainly those super moms, attack me when I try to give my experience with autism. I feel like I should stop doing it. Ps yes I know my rant there major spelling mistakes  https://t.co/pBvWuaEEzN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates I have autism and depression so I can so relate to this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hey twitter people 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouTube So my video is relevant but asmr is? I don't get why YouTube is pushing stuff like this yet my videos don't get suggested or nothing. No wonder people lose hope in this platform.   https://t.co/VuWNjydTQ1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@New_YouTubers Currently at 48, hoping to reach 500 by the end of 2019.   https://t.co/bmHEqWJWKN<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER I have been there. I have also been the one who has been manipulated by so called friends. That's why it's always best to just be real. If it's not good enough for some people then oh well. Bye Felicia<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FreddieBailey96 @GeorgeAylett Yeah we know lol and it's only going to get worse the longer they are in power<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fallendragon68 Omg twitter has bots too lol that's funny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The end of your career?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaByAli Congrats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER Wow that didn't take long. See this is why I am kinda glad I am a no body on YouTube lol no is checking me for monitization because no one watches my crap of a mess videos lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey @itsNICKSNIDER Savage lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey @TMZ Dam that sucks. It's the reason why I try not to use any clips in my videos anymore. That and I don't tend to edit my videos lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey guys sorry I haven't uploaded a @YouTube video in awhile but here is a short one I did and I have a few more coming up so stay tuned for them too.  Brooke Houts should be arrested for this! @YTCreators @SmallYoutube   https://t.co/MifD2BYxk1  #brookehoutsisover #BrookHouts  https://t.co/bwLwQhKT1w<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why the world is fucked up because of stupid bitches like this. When will the purge become real because someone people need exterminating<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is going to be a new YouTube video coming today guys so keep your eyes open<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey twitter people 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteHolderness You should never be anything other than yourself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey @trishapaytas @itsNICKSNIDER So when does the chat show start and on what channel lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarlenaStell Omg I am crying lol don't cross your mother lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JellyDonutsRule Always remember that life throws us things to test us. We are made of strong stuff and we kick it's ass any day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER Your this bad eh lol  https://t.co/r7i3RI0H2s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER @JeffreeStar The shade 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffreeStar Diamonds are forever baby<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love this ♥️♥️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So they should. She needs to be arrested for what she did. I don't think she will recover from this one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg that's iconic lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cxrstphr Oh I know but it kinda puts me out of the gay community I feel. I mean I will be me and if people don't like it well then sod em. But you know when you feel like this the community that I am supposed to be a part of and I don't feel a part of it. It's a weird feeling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cxrstphr Honestly in the past I have been shamed for having autism, for not wearing the latest fashion or listening to the latest trending music. I am very much very individual and I do wear my heart on my sleeve a lot. Which gets me in to trouble.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cxrstphr It's not a dig at you. Maybe I poor choice of the word ghosted but I feel like I have been from the gay community because I am different<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lancaster32 Yep I am almost 31 and I haven't achieved anything I wanted to when I was younger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When the gay scene think having a mental health disability is something that either means your ghosted from the community or they just out rude to you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER Oh dam  https://t.co/7b33Cac78Y<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pringster78 True can only but try. I plan to do it on here too. But on here it's more me just venting and commenting on everything lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darkestflameboy Welcome back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pringster78 I am screwed because I actually want to use YouTube to send a message about mental health. Which I bet won't get any where<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got to love a #blackandwhitephoto #filter  Hey how are ya?!  https://t.co/XJCBAUuuOw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattsinger 30 days of night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsangelaa_xo What business is it of theirs what you eat or don't eat. I hate it when people do this. It's not of their business<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey there twitter people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilycarding @blaiklockBP I was waiting for someone to mention it lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Congrats 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>EXACTLY!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarlenaStell Thank you some else said it. I feel like I am beating my head against a wall when I say things like this. Playing mental health will not get you off issues. And it's reason why stigma still exists. It's not a trend. Take it from someone who has to deal with it daily<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EgglestonMathew I was there on Sunday lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeaByAli @ThreeDailey @itsNICKSNIDER @messymarkk I want to know what drugs he is on to think the shit he does is ok lol and where I can get them from lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Honestly I'm not a dog person, I am a cat person. Because dogs running and jumping at me scares me. I know that they are just saying hello and it's all friendly. I would never harm the dog though. Ever. Dogs just want your attention that's all. The video made me wicked<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PineCreekPoet So very true<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Why just why? 😱 I bet he thinks he is god's gift<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How's everyone's afternoon going people?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER I swear I must be doing my videos totally wrong if this person manages to get the engagement she does and I don't lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey @JeffreeStar You beat me to this today Dustin lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey If YouTube go down this path they not only loose viewers and a lot of creators but also a lot of brands and revenue too so they need to be very careful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sapphire9692 @Kenzie_23_95 @ThreeDailey I'm going to stop you right there. I volunteer within mental health and also have mental health my self. DO NOT sit there and try to justify her cruel behaviour by saying mental health I am getting really fucked off with influencers using that excuse. It's not and never will be<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER @ThreeDailey Lol guess they want to start drama by spouting crap about drama channels. Isn't that the oldest trick in the youtuber hand book lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsangelaa_xo I am not shocked. I am not at a level to be monitized so when I actually get give minutes to do a video to put my five cents they can't do squat lol. But hey we all now know Susan does Alfie favours. I think a trend is starting and it stinks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@estahlord @itsangelaa_xo Oh I have a code name for him "Tit' seems accurate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the actually hell. These people need locking up. They are hurting innocent animals for views and clicks. Absolutely disgusting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey there twitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg I'm dead 😂😂😂😂♥️♥️♥️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kaidiovascular Oh I could go off on a rant with this one but I know it won't get me anywhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kaidiovascular @Elstro1988 It's ok it's the same over all th social media platforms lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DJNSussex You want to see the Instagram bots lol pictures of girls in next to nothing asking me to marry them lol hummmmm me thinks their computers are a little screwed lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffreeStar Hummmm what's the tea<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is she being serious. Go climb back under that rock it has nothing to do with absent fathers. It's hate crimes plain and simple<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ultrajoecomic I really hate to burst his bubble but all commentary/ drama channels (myself included, not that I am very good with my channel) all use the same line. "Anything said in this video is my own personal they are not facts please don't send any hate to the people we spoke of"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow just wow there are no words to describe this expect. Sick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GP_SexualHealth @LGBTEXEC @LGBTEduAnswers What annoys me here is. They want the lessons banned because of their religious beliefs and the kids being too young. Well it works both ways. The kids don't know their beliefs yet and you know in those churches they teach homophobia so it's like seriously. The statement is crap<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Good I am glad ♥️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Happy birthday Mr I hope you had a special day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's get this party started in here lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning twitter people 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey hey twitter people 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@5HAHEM So basically all the signs in the winter months your saying lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Looking good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey @itsNICKSNIDER @tanamongeau Vodka, I imagine you would need plenty of vodka to be on that show.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey Is he trying to start drama still lol you would think that he would have just got lost by now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey twitter people 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER This bitch I guess. Ps that's way to much lip filler  https://t.co/cu3kpGnpQl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER Awwww someone got hurt by your video what a shame. Don't like the video don't watch it simples lol I feel this comment was mad by either a 12 year old or very very loyal Stan lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrJamieD Traditional chocolate all the way and I probably would it all and still want more lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsNICKSNIDER How ironic I see this after re watching Tati's bye sister video that someone had re uploaded lol still think she had some good points in it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>U know what @QuestionLGBTedu  may want 2 hide behind a keyboard 2 discuss this but I didn't. I did multiple videos on this subject cos I am not afraid to speak up on it. U can hide + spread ur hate speech on a keyboard. These lessons WILL teach tolerance   https://t.co/dpaBMqD079<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates I am like 4 hours late but hey lol how are ya<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey twitter people 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeDailey So very true 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New video up on my #YouTube channel guys.  @jamescharles and #jaclynhill NEEDS to be canceled after this. @YouTube needs to do something because it can not go on like this. These people are toxic and should not be allowed the platform they have.   https://t.co/lCz14Eer0U<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScotCuthbertson We do all need to come together. Your right one account isn't the only issues here. The bigger picture needs to be shared for all. We need to come together. all communities and stop this before it gets any worse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pringster78 It is and if this was the other way around every authority going would soon be involved and we would all soon be arrested for it. But this hateful account and hate agenda they have going on is still allowed. Makes me sick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pringster78 I still think this account should be shut down  the police involved and the IP address tracked and all involved arrested for hate crimes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hello twitter land 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eightiesbear @Twitter @QuestionLGBTedu I want to know why it's active too. I reported it aswell and have them the 5 tweets they needed also so is this account still here. I think police action needs to be against them to be honest for a hate crime but that's just my opinion<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MarlenaStell Totally agree. Although I did that to a man I would be called gay lol I mean so it's not really a bother but the man species works so differently. Strange that hey lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarlenaStell Amen! Even though I ain't a woman. I feel the sentiment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarlenaWhale You have got to be kidding me. Why the hell do people do this stuff. What for "clout"? Sorry love you just look like total moron.

<|startoftext|>@CarlStark This is the mood of many lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chibikuma83 That's seriously corny as hell. Why do people feel the need to advertise that they have a man is it to make others jealous or something<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is everyone today?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anthony_covell_ There are so many bigots still world it's did heartening. Your right a gay is a safe space for the LGBT+ community and if some straight people can't accept us then they need to drink some where else because we don't like to have to do things like this at all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robcog1992 I made mine one an hour and I think he has fallen back to sleep lol oh well he is the only person I know who can drink cold tea<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hey people how are you all? I hope you all are having a wonderful #saturday so far 😘😎♥️  It's all wet and miserable up here in Carlisle today. Back to the usual weather up here in the north lol  https://t.co/nQFcwFjStq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's through the worst times in your life that you find out who your true friends are. FACTS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So very true lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jay_been I totally agree Britain needs to be strong on the fact and teach children tolerance. One of my YouTube videos is on this very subject and I feel strongly on this. They need to put the law down and tell them that no matter what these lesson are going to be taught<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Liampcahill Facts!! 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlfieDeyes I always look dumb and I know it lol I own that and I run with it lol it's part of my being now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eliistender10 I thought I was the only who does this 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This image is damaging to the community. How dare they use famous people to get their point across which is a false point. Why can't people just respect others for who they are. There is too much hatred in this world. I sense homophobia in this image which sad. Needs to stop<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yorkiepud76 I am close to number 4 I think but who cares it's about what your personality is whats inside you that counts. Looks fade but being beautiful on the inside lasts a life time<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Eugenia_Cooney I totally agree with you on this, we should support each other and be kind. But always remember to let people walk all over you at the same time. Be strong in who you are and stand up for those who can't stand up for themselves. I hope your having a lovely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning Twitter 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Noah_Halpin How dare someone try to make a mockery of your journey. It was meant to be in your own time and when you was ready to share it. Good on you for taking control of the situation. We need more courages people like in this world to show other people it can be done<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Five minutes in I was like seriously!  You haven't grown up at all. Same annoying put on voice acting like your 13 when your 20. When will you grow up @jamescharles I am still waiting for it because this isn't it. Same generic stuff all of you do.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PeteHolderness Morning 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thekjohnston Religion should not be allowed to have any say in any political thing what so ever. They contribute nothing but trouble when they do. So I think they should be banned from having a say in how a country is run at all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayjonfknallan Loving the hair colour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayloredBites @repeattofade I think you might be right there. I mean I don't want to take away something good if that's what he is doing but sometimes I feel that there are other ways of doing things is all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks to be a good one I will be going to see this when it comes out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg what is the world coming too. This is why we need more police force out there. The world has gone crazy with all these attacks. It needs to be stopped  BBC News - Coventry McDonalds 'drive-by' attack: Teenage boy shot  https://t.co/DwoTTJ8Zor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlueEyedAlways It's a cool dressing gown. I would wear it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayloredBites @repeattofade I am all for all impowering women I know some very strong minded females but, and correct me if I am wrong, isn't this just a thirst post and he wanted to stay relevant at the same?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/vEcHEsFRme<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning you lovely people ♥️👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonathonJake @MACcosmetics I would have given him a little punch lol well that's what mine would have gotten haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlfieDeyes Bloody hell your not far from me I don't think lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ant_917 I totally agree what the actual fuck lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesFl Why is she is trending in the UK for? It's not like she does anything good these days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skambition @TrevorProject @jamescharles So he apologises and that makes everything ok? Actions speak louder than words in my book. While I agree this is a good cause that he is doing. Don't for one second think that this isn't for publicity just like his next to nothing clothes. One man's opinion though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouTube @awesomenesstv @lifeaseva And when your doing what they come watch my view video and subscribe for more out spoken realness.   https://t.co/ZWNHlMxGQE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates I often do this myself and there are so gorgeous houses where I live. Shame I will never own one but the thought is there lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayloredBites See I am just very out spoken so I use my words plus I will never have the body plus I don't think even if I did I would do that because to me it's what everyone is doing. I like to be different lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KillianTriIl And this ladies and gentlemen is why some people should have swallowed instead of going all the way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love this ♥️♥️♥️♥️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone having a good day?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TayloredBites Yes trans women did pave the way too sorry. There is many different ways to tell a story. I have done it through poetry and writing. Curious to see what his story is. I don't think going topless will help the cause tbh because it's pretty generic. Don't want to creat hate mind u<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EgglestonMathew @ThomasTurgoose1 Thats so nice of him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@repeattofade @TayloredBites @willam I am pretty sure, and you can correct me if I am wrong, that it was drag queens and such that paved the stonewall riots? So I don't get why going topless proves anything. Is it just to get 'clout' as they call it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonathonJake @MACcosmetics Ouch your hubby is savage. Tbh it's something mine would say. Did he at least tell you you looked cute after and didn't need make up?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg this is so cute ♥️♥️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this is why the UK is going to pot. You guys actually want this moron in office lol for the live of God please someone do something quick<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheSimonC90 Libra here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need some @YouTube advice because I don't what I am doing wrong with my channel but it just doesn't to be going anywhere. Any ideas people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning Twitter friends 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CasperBryson Tell them to mind their own business and if that doesn't work. I always use "you can't be practising everything in those religious texts because gossiping is frowned up on as is mixing your fabrics so get lost and let me live my life" they soon shut up then<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarlenaStell @comcast How do you manage to go through that many emails. It just take like an hour to go through them all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just had to post this 😂😂😂😂  https://t.co/Bs37M5aGWU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zakisboring If I had a body like that then I probably would but I don't so I just try to be as loud as I possible can to get attention that way lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouisePentland You know she is going to be super star one day and rock the world<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And that's why it's an unpopular opinion because it's a trash opinion. Now try say something that makes sense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey guys. How are you all doing? Don't forget to go check out my latest new video and share the hell out of it so I can get some love 😂😂😂 subscribe to my channel if you haven't already also. @YouTube @YTCreators    https://t.co/dpaBMqD079<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsangelaa_xo It's no great loss really is it lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MorgzHudson Wait someone has the name xX_Badman123_Xx? 😂😂😂 I know my name isn't that great but you know someone of the he of 12 made that shit up lol what's with the aggression too why do they want to box so much? Got nothing better to do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsangelaa_xo U have got to be kidding me. This "kid" really thinks he is the big guy in the YouTube world doesn't he lol. He should be grateful 4 everything he has. There is some of us who can't even get any views or any subscribers but he is complaining about his life 😂😂 lol entitled brat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JellyDonutsRule Remember to take a moment for you. I know things maybe getting on top of you right now. Take a step back for a moment, away from the situation, and just remember to breath. It can be hard to focus when it's all at once but you can do it. I have faith in you<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TideBanking I wouldn't know the first thing what to do lol I don't even use my bank for business lol would love to know how this came up on my news feed. I am trying to make it as a youtuber so that might be why lol don't think baking can help me with that though haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IAMJSCRIPT That's the way mate. Keep that positive spirit up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Bring on the party captain Dan 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IAMJSCRIPT Totally agree. I think this across the board with all social media though. It will never change mind you. There will always be small minded people out there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MemeQueenTwitch Oh girl I think you might upset a few people with this one lol ps I totally agree with you 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not all negative things in your life is bad. You can turn anything in to a positive if you just have the right mind set. Always be the best that you can be<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Chris_CPH It's very true. It's not a numbers game which a lot of people seem to think it is. They just want to be this social media guru thing now so they can be famous lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ramck002 You look terrified lol as would I be if I was there before a long shift at work too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beardyderp I know the struggle. It's a hard thing to both explain and live with. Sending hugs to you and everyone out there also struggling. Never think your alone<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JellyDonutsRule It does I fully understand. Respect needs to be given to everyone and also needs to be had by everyone too. It's s two way street but to hey respect you must first give respect out.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@khloekardashian See someone influencers know how to release a brand. I don't know how some people can get it so wrong. I bet this doesn't flop so hard like other brands.   https://t.co/LH6ENUpSKX<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PineCreekPoet That's shocking. It's offensive and seriously haven't people got anything better to do. Why do people hate on other people it confuses me. But then again I think I am from a different planet 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PineCreekPoet Wait people really retweet your selfies with word vomit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmmaKennedy I understand where your coming from but your calling out one type of person in this statement. I think they do know how damaging he is they just maybe not be as vocal is all<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AmyAshenden I know I am not a big brand or anything but I did make a #youtube speaking out about the education protests, it's not a massive step but every little bit helps. It's shocking this all happens still and heartbreaking.   https://t.co/LH6ENUpSKX<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@msm4rsh Happy birthday hunni I hope your having s fabulous day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning people. How are you all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisPJGodfrey Really. This is just shocking. They are all just evil people with nothing better to do than cause trouble for innocent people. It's homophobia and it needs to be stopped.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey guys can you please share and like my latest video because I feel that I make some very good points and I feel that the comments in the comment section need highlighting also. Thank you in advance   https://t.co/H9RNClBWY2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Owen_Lloyd07 Great work on setting up the group. It's a shame that the homophobic people have to come and try to ruin it. Keep up the good work<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsangelaa_xo Couldn't agree more<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love this. A very powerful message.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@violinisbae with all the questions. Good don't preech how someone else should follow their faith if you don't like people preeching how you should follow yours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@violinisbae And who the hell are you to tell people how they are to live or how they are practice their religion. So i take your Christian then? Do follow the Bible to the letter, do you not shell fish, do you not mix your fabrics? Have you had sex outside marriage. feeling uncomfortable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning people. I hope your all doing well. Sending love and hugs to those who need it right now ♥️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsangelaa_xo What did I miss this time? It's so hard to keep up with what drama is going on where in which community.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing I said in my video was slander at all I think I made some good points:    https://t.co/H9RNClBWY2  These comments are why I will continue to make my videos my own way and if you don't like it well then that's your issue not mine.  https://t.co/kOmh1Cys82<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry there was no video guys tonight guys but I would like to show you all that homophobia and bigotry still actually exists within the world we live in today. These people should hold their heads in shame. I will not accept abuse being thrown at me.   ... (1/2)  https://t.co/I17E2szBBF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rylan @EstherMcVey1 @piersmorgan @susannareid100 @GMB This topic really angers me so much that I even made a video on it, why on earth can't people just move society. They are going to be reaching acceptance of all people, but of course we can't have can we?   https://t.co/H9RNClBWY2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Education4Libs No one every said being gay is a super power so I don't know where you got that from.

<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Oooh wow. The queen I can see as s massive event. The president no so much. I think he causes more problems than he solves but hey I am just no body on the internet what do I know right lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates So a nice relaxing few days for you then 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates How are you doing today? 😀<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Good morning Twitter people how are you all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dalehay Oh I am the same I never pay for things either in games<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dalehay I will have to go out on the hunt for gyms with my team in it lol I know I have put Pokémon in a gym before but I was on my own then and it didn't last long<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dalehay Ah see I don't leave my Pokémon in gyms I really should do tbh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PositiveLad @Jimmyavenger Congrats it's so lovely to see that love wins out X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dalehay I am on the day one with the ripple in time one but I want that mew so I am just trying evolve that magikarp. They also need to make the Pokémon bag bigger 300 is not enough in my opinion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisprestage I don't mind you posting them 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ALISHAMARIE Good morning. It's the afternoon here in the UK 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dalehay Your lucky they don't spawn up here lol I live Carlisle. Well non that I can see of anyways. I really should get it done because it's taken forever and I want to do the ripple in time one and the next for that is walk Eevee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dalehay Yeah that's the one I am on too. It's taking me ages. Magikarp take for ever to evolve because they ain't around in the wild anymore so having to get the candies through walking alone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dalehay That's a good way to look at it. I haven't caught anything good for a while. I am just doing the walking to get magikarp candies to try and finish the mew research lol I am still on it which is taking forever to do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dalehay That's the hope, charity shops are usually the same though. How's the Pokémon catching going? Caught anything good?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Good morning Twitter 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsangelaa_xo Your so right I think they have dirt on each other too.  But I don't think we will ever know to what extent though because they have all pretty much just put it all to bed now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why I am not famous?  Because I am a blond fuck and don't wear make up so I can do make up things on YouTube because apperently that's where it's at now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dyrojo Awwwww colds ain't nice. But hey at least you still look cute that's a plus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mortal Kombat 11 has got to be one of the best story lines ever. I mean just wow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsangelaa_xo Oooops well we will still wait for it Hun<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Good morning Twitter 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am so having an off day today. I don't know what's wrong with me I just feel low and I don't know why. So I am thinking a good swimming session might help boost my mood. What do you guys do to help boost your mood? If you having an off day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Totally agree 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning Twitter 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CambridgeGuy1 I see trouble is here lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsangelaa_xo This is why I am so afraid to come back to doing YouTube videos. I mean yeah I sucked before anyways but look at how toxic it's become. Why can't they all just use their platform to spread positivity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a glorious Monday today let's hope it stays the same all day. How is everyone today? I hope you all have a fantastic Monday 😀 remember to always spread positive vibes 😘  #monday #positiveoutlook #positivevibes #positivity #bepositive #positivethinking #selfie  https://t.co/qv3ktm2i84<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PeteHolderness Hey 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSimonC90 That is the best hang over cure right there 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteHolderness I think this too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A message 4 @jamescharles @GlamLifeGuru &amp; @JeffreeStar. I understand the situation is ott but the beauty community needs more positively in it. Move forward and heal. It doesn't matter who said what at this point. The message that should come next is positivity &amp; healing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates How are you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Good morning 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamescharles I'll be brutally honest I jumped on this because I believed her video she made it look so empowering at times like there was a message of positivity in there too. But after watching your video I am like wow I don't want to think. I apologise if I hurt you with comments.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I will never be ashamed of being who I am. No one will take away the essence of who I am<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarlStark That would be a dream. It's the reason why I don't use Snapchat because I got sick of being sent nude photos all the time, made for very colourful arguments though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSimonC90 Nothing wrong with being emotional. I get like it too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarlStark You mean one where people don't send nude pictures?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never apologise for being who you are. There is only one of you in this world and if people don't like that, well then that's their issue not yours. Live each moment for you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surround yourself with people that people build you up! Because there is much negativity in this world and so many people that will just use you. So it's about time you got with people that bring out the best in you.…  https://t.co/y8x24XGL9B<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@itsangelaa_xo Is she really that hated? I always found her kinda ok. I mean the woman must be doing something right she owns a multi million dollar company and I am sure her make up line isn't the only money making deal she has that's successful<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LouisePentland How rude of her. Why do certain women feel the need to pull other women down I don't fully understand it. Isn't there like this thing now where women should stick together and help each other up? Or am I missing something?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I will never understand how the @YouTube algorithm works 🤣 I mean I am having to sit and post my video everywhere which if I am honest makes me look stupid. Why don't you guys promote us small YouTubers? Ain't we good enough like the big ones?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KimKardashian Your hair @KimKardashian  is on point. Your killing it queen ♥️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stebro314 I am unsure if I want to try and catch it yet. It does seem like a bit of hard to catch it if I am honest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chibikuma83 All price events went down hill years ago when they started to charge people to go. It's just an excuse for people to go and get drunk now. There is no "pride" in it<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@shanedawson I feel your pain. As someone who tries to keep up with the trends so I can comment I always fall flat lol I am always behind and therefore my efforts just go unnoticed. That and my voice is crap haha<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@shera_tanvir @itsangelaa_xo Oh that's makes more sense now haha. I guess that's YouTube for ya coz you know they want Zoella fans to find the queen's channel and videos lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know I shouldn't but @khloekardashian babys name is True, @KimKardashian child's is North and @robkardashian babys name is Dream. Put them together and you have Dream True North Kardashian. You got to admit that's funny in its own unique way right? PS yes I'm weird I know 😂🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just point out why do people give a shit where @khloekardashian spent her Thanksgiving. I mean really don't you lot have anything else better to do like I dunno go get your nails done or something. Ps I honestly thought she was just doing it for True but still it's her life.<|endoftext|>

I can click on the tweet which you have responded to and I can see why they tweeted in the first place and oh look it was who started in the first place. So yeah!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pringster78 If she wanted to do that why not just apply for big brother lol I hear that's the way to do it these days 😂🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The chilling adventures of Sabrina is a great twist on the classic TV show. They really out did themselves with it. The only nit pick I have is that once again American TV shows have misrepresented what actual witchcraft but other than that. It's awesome 10/10<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaysteruk Cuties 😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaysteruk Hey hey 😁<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Omg really. But I bet the battery is still crap on them though. I have just upgraded to a huawie p20 so I can't do it but I need reviews if you go for it lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the world needs a total shift in power you know. You have these dumb ass people in power who don't know the first thing about human rights or compassion and some of them don't even have common sense. I know come on idiots read an article. They might learn something<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaymerChat Omg I would love her on my crew too she sounds awesome 😂😁<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jhazan Ah I was slow on the tweeting as usual lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ForAMoment I believe who ever makes the phone. So in my case it would be android lol. If your talking who about who created time well humans did way back when. Time is a human creation that we just accept<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jhazan Sounds like hell I hate it when they are like that. Chin up mate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DJNSussex Lol well at least I know want to bring for a drink then haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GjordyC I meant to put is more funny. I don't know why it typed isn't stupid hands<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GjordyC Oh I would just not to let get to you. I got it was. It wasnt even aimed at a person that's what makes me laugh even more at how easy this person attacked you. First it's out of context and second the subject isn't aimed at a person so I think the backlash isn't more funny lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mcrbill61 😂😂😂 omg that's hilarious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GjordyC Right now correct me if I am wrong but isn't this a gender fluid joke not a trans joke? Because it's just a joke about how easy people have offended by something having the name of a gender in it rather than an actual gender part? Or am I thinking to literal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thatgregperson I didn't know you had people on twitter doing only fan pages too I thought it was just an Instagram thing. Not that I subscribe to any because 1. I'm broke and 2. A lot for the content you can just search and find it for free anyways online.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@calumscott Nothing to worry about I was 30 two days ago 😂😂 welcome to the club lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I came out later than every1 else in life my age. I did it at 16 where as people my age back then was coming out at like 13/12. Every1 in my family knew already so it may it much easier but it still took a lot of courage to say it though. #worldcomingoutday<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#WorldMentalHealthDay2018 I like the idea there is mental health day but why just a day? People who suffer with mental health (myself included).

<|startoftext|>I have just read that coffee is actually really good for you. The only thing that makes it bad for you is the fact we add milk and sugar to it. Do you think I should start drinking black in the morning and then drinking water. You know be healthier?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Oh I can't do it lol it always ends in disaster lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Awwww that will be fun day. Painting. I hated painting which is why only one of my living room is done lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates I am good thanks. You got much on today?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSimonC90 I don't go to pride but that's because I can't handle big amounts of crowds. The statement on which pride is for I stand by. I have watched countless stories about it and read many articles too it was a hard time before the pride marches. We have come a long way. Stand strong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Morning Dan 🤗 hope all is well<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IndieGates @LukeE3 Oooh I bet that's all exciting stuff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey hey twitter people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right time for this one to go to sleep. Speak to you lovely lot tomorrow. Night twitter!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheGigiGorgeous Very true and you look like a doll as always.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jessiepaege I guess the best advice I could give you would be to let them come to terms with it on their own. Yes say it's ok for them to be LGBTQ+ but it's all about finding the balance with kids in schools. They are still finding out who they are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LukeE3 I lose followers all the time and I follow them back but hey don't fret I am sure you will get more followers. Your a nice guy and you speak to everyone so you will get just as many back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllAbout_Stu I have a few that people have brought me over the years and a very cute pudsy bear that I have since I was like 8 lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aka_stopher Wow your a size 8? Jesus I need to lose weight lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does it come repeats lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I never knew people spoke so much on twitter before wow you guys can talk lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSimonC90 Ok my thoughts are........ WOW he is hot!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SlatteryDave Anytime 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SlatteryDave You look cute<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LukeCS_Music It can be. But remember your the priceless gem and if they can't see your shine anymore then it's their issue not yours. You should still go out there and shine brighter than ever before<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timchech Sexy seflie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beardyderp And how much did you have to drink to be hanging so bad?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamiemarchant95 Mint chocolate ice-cream<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itstheHop I have never really tried Gin. Now vodka on the other hand I can drink like it's water lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Am I the only person here who is from #Birmingham ? Just curious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRealJScript Yep I can get like it at times and the best I do is just avoid people at all costs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ham and cheese kievs with salad #dinner #food #foodporn #delicousfood #yummyfood  https://t.co/vOv8iK142S<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheRealJScript Well the title doesn't thrill me lol maybe you should try the originals that's a good series<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Good real friendships never die mate 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do love this cat even though she is a total pain at times #catlover #cutecat #adorablecat   PS also love my new phone look at how awesome this picture looks with no editing  https://t.co/CdrdkXSgQU<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Tone_twit It can be that. Pride now wasn't what it was created for all those years ago. It's just excuse for people to go out and get drunk now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tone_twit It's ok we all live differently i think and that's what makes life interesting. The spice of life. Some of us shine in massive social environments and others silently guide and help in the shadows lol. So how come u don't like pride?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tone_twit Yeah. I suffer from social anxiety so it's a total nightmare, i am probably going to be called something now because i am not a proper gay haha<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Yeah my friend follows f1 and so does my dad so I get to hear all about it when it's on and I do watch it from time to time and I find I do like it. Much more interesting that football at least those guys actually work for their stuff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates I know me too now rugby I like but that's just because they look fit lol not that I watch that either just look at the pictures. I am not really a sporty person however I do love swimming<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Lol oh dear I have had to go through that pain a few times myself. You could always say if I wanted to watch a load of men try to chase balls for 90 mins I'd go down to the local gay bar lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So very true  https://t.co/DRc0REqbNk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Strength comes from knowing what you want in life and believing in who you are. Not from your muscles. Its all about being who you want to be that's the real courage of this world so go out there and shine bright people. Never back down for anyone<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IndieGates I totally agree. There is a way it is handled and I think some people get it wrong because they got for it not meaning to be that cruel. There is no need to be a dick about it just speak your mind in a calm way I think. That's my view anyways lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Good I like that about someone. A kind heart but isn't afraid to speak the truth when needed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouisePentland You rock that angle. I don't rock angle hun lol hence why I don't take much photos haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates Ah I am just a friendly talker who speaks his mind lol gets me in to trouble sometimes<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IndieGates lol I know I must be annoying u by commenting so much..... But move it chop chop lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You, yes you, can make all the impact in someone's life just by saying hello or smiling when walking by, it can lift someone up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RemarkableJamie nope it doesn't, a simple smile can make all the difference to someone, and it annoys me when I see people don't show it bk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates I know lol but the strange thing about love is, you love them and want to kill them to lol it's a great combo lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates which part, the almost married or the Twitter buddy one lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevinkennedy4 I follow you lol and one makes all the difference lol<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RemarkableJamie the fight we battle each day can be helped by a simple smile or someone being polite and that's why I am so polite :-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndieGates lol well beings as you put it that way, which way we heading lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To help someone and expect something in return that's not being helpful that's seeing an opportunity when someone is down. That's not caring<|endoftext|>
