<|startoftext|>Jesus' discussion of who to fear and the Fear of the Lord right after He talks about hypocrisy is no mistake. How we feel about God in light of how we feel about how others feel about us is all wrapped up together.  https://t.co/EIoNdjTwBV<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Whether it's a snap bracelet, a Mercedes hood ornament on a chain, or self-righteousness, whatever we make into a status symbol is going to rule us. Jesus was honest with His hearers about what should be important.  https://t.co/B65JHLjBfF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus talks about light and dark like it's something that we have control over and like something that we've been given to wield all at the same time.  https://t.co/hz6EVl8ChW<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Jesus talks a little trash in His own Galilean Rabbi way. When the Pharisees accuse Him of being on the team of Satan, Jesus explains to them what they haven't understood for years.  https://t.co/NVCurFW2q3<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>When asked, Jesus told the disciples plainly how to pray. Now we can recite it, pray it, contemplate it, and watch it come to pass. It's the "Lord's Prayer" according to many Bible notes, and rightly so.  https://t.co/1XJXVI6T7Q<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Ancient Greek word they used in a job description is the same one Jesus used when He mentioned the "good thing" that Mary had chosen when she sat down and listened to Jesus teach.  https://t.co/ULNnNpgYo3<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I can't say what people thought of Samaritans because there are pre-school leaders in this group, but let me tell you, it was bad.

<|startoftext|>All at once, Jesus showed that the Law of God was good, but that it was lacking something. That lacking developed a longing that anyone that studied the Law would experience when they were around Jesus.  https://t.co/dYTDDNOr2Y<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's easy to think of "taking up your cross" as what you'd die for, but the way Jesus explains it, it's more about shame and choosing what you'll LIVE for until you die.  https://t.co/mTQLbvpbgc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everybody had expectations for Jesus, even the disciples. The question was: who was going to let Christ redefine their expectations?  https://t.co/u8X41Wvfb4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#OLConnectionCampaign #OneLifeAnywhere   https://t.co/xlgjliBfKe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus will come face to face with Herod later, but Luke gives us a little "in the mean time" glimpse into the political murmurings that were happening while Jesus was proclaiming the arrival the Kingdom of God.  https://t.co/kfQAM6dUQj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The power and directions that Jesus gave them weren't just rules and tools for the disciples. It was all part of the message to them and to the world. Just go.  https://t.co/2mv8MId2Fe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Walking strong in our faith in Christ is some of the toughest stuff to do, especially as we hear more and more bad news on the way home like Jarius.  https://t.co/Tga4M63Gig<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The village that saw a man healed of possibly 6,000 demons wasn't ready to welcome someone as powerfully compassionate as Jesus.  https://t.co/N8fYvTXEs4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When Jesus allowed those demons to go wherever they wanted, they went into a herd of pigs and changed the landscape for the whole area. The man changed the most became Jesus' newest disciple/evangelist. And all he had to do was be himself.   https://t.co/jqOZorERIC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When the man possessed by the demons that called themselves "Legion" came running to Jesus, he fell down on his knees and asked Jesus for mercy. That was all he could do.  https://t.co/S3dZ3ftJCo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In this anecdote of Jesus waking up from a nap and saving the day, we also get some encouragement on how to pray. It's alright to be wrong and to tell Jesus stuff. Be ready when He fixes it and corrects you.  https://t.co/9vjwZS5uEA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When a seed hits the good soil and grows, it REALLY GROWS! But not too fast. Jesus says it's with patience, so hang in there.  https://t.co/xnU3NxHnJq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes Jesus' parables aren't exactly clear. We don't have that excuse in the parable of the sower. Especially where Jesus says the specific things that keep Christians from being mature and fruitful.  https://t.co/fv6FKW2x6f<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're praying through the parable of the sower this week, which maybe we should call the parable of the dirt and seeds. When somebody throws the word of the Lord your way, here are some ways to help it grow.  https://t.co/LdFXvjIPHN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The followers of Jesus were men and women from all different walks of life. In this section we read today, we learn about a few of the women that were among the first disciples.  https://t.co/xZfsFFmppc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(almost) every weekday we put out a Daily Bible Reading. Some stats came in and I thought you'd be encouraged by a flashback of some of the greatest hits according to Google search numbers.  https://t.co/Cmtq76V4G1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There were rules of hospitality and hosting guests, and both Simon and the sinful woman ignored them for very different reasons.  https://t.co/N47YZyTOqn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Praise God for what we learn from this 'sinful' woman's boldness! We put ourselves in every story we read about Jesus. Try being Simon in this one today.  https://t.co/MKZYG9iooq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Pharisees didn't like John the Baptist and his conservative diet or Jesus and His liberal diet. Jesus tells them they shouldn't be judging diets anyway, they should be listening. It's good advice for us, too.  https://t.co/nBxdTcbC7B<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The book of Hebrews is a grand presentation of why Jesus is so awesome and how to have faith in Him. It draws to a conclusion that through everything, we should look to His faithfulness and follow Him.  https://t.co/e00vIQ6aPX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We know from Romans that God justifies sinners, but did you know in the Gospel of Luke, sinners justify God?  https://t.co/pzBQe91V0L<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As He commends John the Baptist for what he did, Jesus also tells us a lot about Himself and makes a political joke at King Herod.   https://t.co/tcwOFib6SO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know those people that hold signs and get your attention about the furniture store going out of business? Jesus gave us some signs to hold like that, and one of them you can do today.  https://t.co/AUN4liRl6k<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There was something great about Jesus raising a guy from the dead, obviously, but the town saw it as God Himself living among them!  https://t.co/nzM6aV5iY6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus tells the parable of the two houses in a slightly different way through Matthew's ears, but not completely different. He's still telling us to make our faith in Him the real deal.  https://t.co/tnMZGqaBaS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We can learn so much from Jesus when we take His teachings in context. The parable of the house on the rock and the sand wasn't an isolated parable. It was in the context of enemies and judgment.  https://t.co/l0d1VH6IpR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We show mercy to others as children of our Heavenly Father because He has shown us SO much mercy. Even today, we can watch Him show mercy on people as a signal for us to do it too.  https://t.co/MFbEVxvvCU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If we can't put away Jesus' teaching to "love your enemies," maybe we dance around what exactly He means by 'love.' I mean, did Jesus really mean what He said? Let's let the Bible interpret itself and look at how we deal with Love and Hate.  https://t.co/eoXeBu2hXY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Love your enemies" is one of the top bible verses to be filtered out when we pick a religion of rules over following the awesome Messiah Jesus. Maybe it's because we're looking that this verse in the wrong way.  https://t.co/06GrBXjGSY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When Jesus got everyone's attention by His amazing deeds of healing and casting out evil spirits, He began teaching. His teachings were almost as amazing as His works. Even today, we have a lot to learn from Jesus.  https://t.co/AE4PdYIDIi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus spent the whole night praying before He called His disciples. Not just once, but twice, because they were a group that really needed to get along with one another.   https://t.co/66Qo1P0kKH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus was deliberately healing people on the Sabbath because He wanted to show them mercy and because He wanted even the Pharisees to repent and believe in Him. In His great mercy, even miracles of healing weren't work for Him.  https://t.co/GyZjA3HCEB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When Jesus made this statement about the sick people needing a doctor, not the well, was He telling the Pharisees they didn't need Him? Was He calling the tax collectors sick to their faces? Yep and Yep.  https://t.co/nMLfM8ZSey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When Jesus said "Go tell the priests," He sent a ticking time bomb of good news right into the temple. He cared for the man with leprosy and He cared for the Levites too.   https://t.co/DxAX72y4Fq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"He left everything and followed Jesus" is a phrase that's worth meditating on, not excusing or explaining away.  https://t.co/Mtb613nKMo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus called Peter at first to just loan Jesus his boat for a make-shift amphitheater. Then He gifted Peter with a zillion fish. The saving, calling, and equipping were all mixed in together.  https://t.co/GY9sfYtzHX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Healings, demons, drama and the Kingdom of Heaven. It's easy to get caught up or bored when we miss the point of the scriptures. Jesus having authority over all creation is the point. It all points to Him.  https://t.co/O85eyIIQ9v<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whether it's because they looked funny, weren't from around here, or you didn't like their hat, we humans have a long history of missing out on truth just because we didn't like the person delivering it. How did Jesus handle it? He left!  https://t.co/fdRAUtLXGz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There were rabbis that read the prophets and taught about how great it would be when it would come true. Then Jesus read Isaiah at the synagogue and said, "This is real, today!"  https://t.co/KiHUEESMEL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Temptation comes in many forms, but it always has one single goal: to strike at our identity as part of God's beloved creation. As we grow in our identity in Christ, temptations are exposed for what they really are.  https://t.co/sSS8hZMcBK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you texted Jesus your temptations, you might get a text back:   IKR?!  He knows all the things we struggle with, because He was tempted in the same ways, but didn't sin.  https://t.co/K6aCV9o17S<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not just a quaint story that Jesus was born in poverty. There are some surrounding details that show just what kind of poverty Joseph and Mary were dealing with.  https://t.co/VFZoaj0Np8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He was born in a tough spot and the first to be notified of the gravity of His birth, besides His parents, were shepherds -- rejects from society and living on the fringes of the civilized folk.  https://t.co/UfiOFKrtuo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You might think "There is no way that kid could grow up to be like John the Baptist or Jesus!" but Luke gives us some tips on how those guys grew up. The rest of scripture backs him up.  https://t.co/7k4M32zagR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The hope for deliverance from oppression has been the hope of people for ages. Zechariah recognized before the first Christmas that all hope of salvation relied on the Messiah.  https://t.co/dPCS6FFChU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know how the opening act is just to liven everyone up for the main act? Look at how excited everyone is about John the Baptist. The Messiah comes next, and He's even greater!  https://t.co/Grl8ReqtBR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every day we have a zillion chances to look at difficulties or look at the great things God is doing. Mary and Elizabeth praise the Lord and we don't have any recorded details of their hardships once John and Jesus entered the scene.  https://t.co/srsV2PpYZ6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When Mary praised the Lord and His mighty right hand, she was putting her pregnancy and the birth of her Child in the context of the greatest event of Jewish history: the Exodus.  https://t.co/4pI4YcV9sk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Known as The Magnificat, this prayer from Mary is really her reaction to something Elizabeth said to her. We're going to spend a few days learning and growing from this prayer.  https://t.co/RFSNnYLPZb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When folks get together next time, you'll know who read about Elizabeth and Mary's reunion and who didn't. #ItsGonnaGetLoud  https://t.co/DVKAB42tUC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God shows up with the glory of possibilities so strong that when He's done, a virgin has a baby, an old lady has a baby, and a king is about to take the throne from oppression and occupation.  https://t.co/ZXXcg6uvjh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To show a created person in the fallen creation favor? God can do it before she deserves it. To send life into an impossible situation, that's where God shows off the most!  https://t.co/UHH7E2Oxvx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and just like that, whatever Zachariah might have ever struggled with or complained about just went away...  https://t.co/WaZbmpBF1i<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"But they had no children" is a comment from Luke about how 1st century Judaism, and 21st century Christianity view the motives and the payoffs of following the Living God faithfully...but He doesn't play by *our* rules.  https://t.co/3uDGveaBXS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Gospel of Luke is a researched, accurate account of Jesus' life from eyewitnesses and several of the apostles that spent years with Jesus. Knowing Luke's motive for writing it is good to remember as we study his gospel.  https://t.co/IAb4dULNfh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Holy Spirit spoke through men and women all of the old testament. It's wild to realize that was Christ and that He carried that history in His head throughout His life in the gospels.  https://t.co/VWVJE4ru1j<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Instead of reading one-liners in Jesus' teaching, we can learn a lot when we see them together in a thread that is all part of the same teaching.  https://t.co/seKTyeVe1t<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, you know it's good to read the bible, but do you know why according to one of the writers? If that's not enough, we have some statistics too.  https://t.co/JNdduaqKad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sure, Habakkuk was a prophet, so he could listen to the Lord a lot. He also gives us some tips as to how we can hear God and what God might be saying.  https://t.co/A0SKo8nvAg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Context is EVERYTHING in the scriptures. So when Matthew puts the birth of Jesus in this context, you know from the start that it's a big deal.  https://t.co/OAh8wiNeMM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Don't neglect meeting together" might be the most half-quoted bible verse of the month, so let's look at it in context and take action on it.  https://t.co/Q2YenTduaH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The corrupt leaders that killed Jesus had to keep on digging their hole deeper as the chance of a real and true resurrection crept closer over the course of 3 days.  https://t.co/woFnlAky4y<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you know what happens on Easter, then it's easy to pick which thief you'd be on Good Friday. Once we do, we can confess and surrender, just like he did -- at any time -- and receive that same salvation.  https://t.co/uZzWbMcz3Z<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's Passover and Easter time, and there has never been a more important time for us to humble ourselves and serve one another in love.  https://t.co/HiPOFvwjbw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes the Psalms or commands and criteria in the Old Testament can be discouraging. We have to read them through Good Friday and the Resurrection to see the fulfillment of God's gracious plan.  https://t.co/ZbMXV6wRUg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God's instructions on the Passover fell on ears full of stress, fear, and hope all at the same time.  https://t.co/AhKz2KOJ9t<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When Moses and Aaron got word that Passover was going to happen, they had a little bit of time to get ready. Easter is a week and a half away. We have time too.  https://t.co/3O242qjtO1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're looking for a great quick-start-sheet from the scriptures about how we're all supposed to live inside our houses for weeks, here you go. Peter knew a thing or two about life together.  https://t.co/3DHf5eE1Ll<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who can possibly fathom the hugeness of God?! But He knows every one of us by name.  https://t.co/vqkeUqr8pl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anytime, day or night, we can look to the Lord and He's listening. His care never weakens and His keeping power for our souls never takes a break.  https://t.co/NEuULrgnsP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When Jesus told the disciples how to pray, He opened with a secret message that the entire relationship of prayer was changing. God is our Father, and we can talk to Him directly.  https://t.co/5o75WpyLyD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are ways that we know how to care for one another, and then there are supernatural ways that we care for one another that really show off the work of Christ.  https://t.co/yNVS4cl3i4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We've got a lot of thoughts going on lately, don't we? Here's a tip from the Apostle Paul on what to do with all of our thoughts.  https://t.co/6gQnlr0Njb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you read the Bible or look at your circumstances, the more you come with an attitude of humility and faith in God, the more you'll grow to see and believe in Him.   https://t.co/L3XXaFQcsc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Paul wanted the church in Corinth to mature so they could help reach more people outside the church. Of course, they could be mature enough from day one.   https://t.co/FhcI26zE0M<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As we wait on the Lord and participate in growing in Him, He is growing in us. Sometimes secretly, sometimes obvious, He is always becoming and being our solid rock foundation.  https://t.co/lsKXIcqYyi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes people don't like free because it's junk, but what if it's free because the Lord Almighty paid for it? Why buy anything else?  https://t.co/Fbql97NaJf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Remember your first love" wasn't just something we got from John in the book of Revelation, it was motivation from the Apostle Paul too. Remember how hyped you were at the beginning? Be that hyped about finishing!  https://t.co/1OiMNChh4o<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If all I do is live for everyone else, will there be any of me left? Jesus did it right, and made a way for us to do it right too.  https://t.co/iDrDIlLH7v<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As Paul traveled around, he let every church he started take part in the building and growth of the next churches.  https://t.co/pGSs1tr1el<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is so much great joy and life in telling someone about the Gospel. All we have to do is ask God how He wants us to do it.  https://t.co/BdCBU2imfh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just like meekness comes from confidence in Christ instead of weakness, serving others as a witness without being dependent on them is also rooted in our relationship with Christ.  https://t.co/Mn0BTVICrb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When Paul had the chance to talk to people that knew the things he knew, he worked in Christ's salvation in a way that made a lot of sense to them.  https://t.co/LTcwcfDukU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is a way of showing off in which we serve others and point attention to God. God loves it like salt on chips or one of those new streetlights on a dark street.   https://t.co/R847BGbb1f<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes it's hard to think about the hard stuff people endure sometimes. But when they are enduring it in Christ, it changes everything.  https://t.co/aUKkGCTe4x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not that the Bible describes our bodies as tents because God likes camping (but I think He does.) It's because He wants us to get the point that our dwell time here is temporary.  https://t.co/Hj4fkVUDWl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Missionary trips take many forms. It helps to have a map when you read about Paul's travels. It also helps to have some boldness as you write your own. #GoBoldly  https://t.co/hwSOwv3P6k #WeAreBold<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A lot of times we wonder about sharing our faith because we might look weird or foolish. Taking that fear out of the way opens us up to share with a ton of receptive people.  https://t.co/7II6V9swDK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you've been exploring faith, or maybe just looking for a place to belong, we would love to meet you this weekend at one of our 3 locations. We will be continuing our conversation about our purpose in life, and seeing our lives as mission and movement.  https://t.co/7P3ieQN7c1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Christianity isn't about a bunch of rules, it's about Christ. God knew that following rules wouldn't ever have salvation power, so He entered the rules Himself -- then sent His Spirit to enter us.  https://t.co/crCvCSPKY7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our full sufficiency to do whatever God calls us to is already in us, in Christ. All you have to do is look at it.   https://t.co/f9r6YQzl3b<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/lEgKeDENWj "It'll all be ok in the end." sounds like a shallow platitude, unless you stake all of your hope on the confidence that it's true -- and it turns out ok in the end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of our deepest desires -- peace and unity between people -- is actually part of God's work inside us. He's preparing a people united in worshiping Him from all nations, even the ones we wouldn't expect.  https://t.co/iSEGO6qnhM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When we look at Christ, we want to bear fruit and show Him off. The best part is that He told us exactly how to do that, sort of.  https://t.co/cy44ynBu3v<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus fulfilled every prophecy the Old Testament prophets said He would, but some of them aren't as obvious as others. But when they become obvious, watch out!  https://t.co/fKda90j5Ql<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Continuing the theme from yesterday that revelation brings about boldness, here is what happened when Paul was accepted into the church in Jerusalem.  https://t.co/PIHe79Qu6n<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When it came to magnifying the Lord, Mary spoke the prayer that would come to be known as the "Magnificat." We're spending all week in it before Christmas.  https://t.co/QAZ35FYeNb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Christ's work and accomplishments for us aren't just in the Gospels or in Paul's letters. They show up in the Psalms sometimes too, and Paul knew it.  https://t.co/nyt0lVpmyq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's good to pay attention in the bible to the things that make God happy. Here is something that actually tallks about God's pleasure, but the details will make *us* happy.    https://t.co/n7tNA4cQc8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When it comes to various situations and places, do different people in your family or friends go first? What does it mean that Jesus IS first in EVERYTHING?  https://t.co/L2GG0wzwDg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have you ever wondered about humans? Why are we here? Why do we exist? Who are we?  Is it just that we are specks in the middle of specklessness...or is there something more to it?  #Centered #OLCentered #worldview   https://t.co/iRYK8j3ACa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If our big brother or our loving Father has gone ahead of us, we have nothing to fear.  https://t.co/HAZekX25DR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When it says Jesus is the "Firstborn" it means so many more great things than the fact that He's our big brother, helping us into the family of God.  https://t.co/H4R6JNGR22<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our WORLDVIEW is our beliefs about the most important and meaningful questions of life.   What do you believe?   https://t.co/yEkLnjjSLz  #worldview #olworldview<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When somebody makes an image of something, they are doing it to represent something bigger and deeper that you can't see, like a fun family reunion, a hope, or a memory. That is just one little reason Jesus came to show us the Father.  https://t.co/IjU4tK7LI5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We pray from Colossians 1 that everyone is filled to the fullest with the knowledge of God. That's full. I mean really full!  https://t.co/tWGoXa42Zn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gideon was God's chosen one for the job, and he did it the way God wanted. Near the end, though, his character started to show signs of wear and tear.  https://t.co/8disUqASAP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not saying you should use this example to guide you next time you ask for some change for the coke machine, but there is something to be said about loyalty and generousity in this episode with Gideon.  https://t.co/9GqihzONwW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God works in the most unconventional ways and in the most practical ways sometimes. With Gideon, God used a leader, some miracles, and hundreds of willing and faithful folks. https://t.co/dIlrXrSM8U<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God gave Gideon the technique that Jesus would eventually use in His parables: go shine the light of truth into situations, the people will either be confused, or turn to the Lord for understanding.  https://t.co/nC4fJxfjMC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God leads us, by His mercy and His own patience, to do the things that will grow our trust and friendship with Him. He's building His kingdom and He's using His beloved people to get the work done.  https://t.co/evsGku9Z7K<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God knows just the encouragement and nudge that we need sometimes. I mean all of the time.  https://t.co/nFZhvsF2cF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While God was sending Gideon's army home by the thousands so that they wouldn't boast in their win, He was still keeping the most alert of the group.  https://t.co/YS6S8ZKTG1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's hard to know what God's will is sometimes. Gideon wasn't sure, so he sort of did what the locals did with their Canaanite gods and goddesses, and God played along.  https://t.co/T29pPzIHXe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By the power of the Holy Spirit, Gideon gathered people together from all over Israel. they might not have understood the full reason of their gathering, but they'd find God's glory in it soon enough.  https://t.co/GqkP1JxNh5 #SmallGroups<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gideon did a bold show of his faith in God, but his dad countered with "If Baal is a god, he can take care of himself." He didn't realize that he had just stated what Yahweh, the one true God, was about to do.  https://t.co/yotmAEvnue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This week we had the joy of talking to Chet Todd on episode 50 of the One Life Podcast. We talked about prayer and a vision for our communities. #olpodcast #podcast   https://t.co/8uiwkJdTuM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nobody remembers who Abinoam was, but his song about his son Barak who brought peace for 40 years has some good leadership tips in it.  https://t.co/kIcAJX2b2u<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you read the bible and come across an out of place, weird verse, hold on to that sucker. It might come up again later.  https://t.co/BuJzzYjDcc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Barak gets a little bit of a rebuke from Deborah, but we can give him some credit. He's leading an army of disorganized men against an army of chariots!  https://t.co/Kyh7ftAziT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God calls people in various ways, but He works with us in our weakness to join us with other people on the same track.  https://t.co/BFBq5RFiSw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The people of Israel wandered off from the Lord and didn't cry out for help for 20 years.  https://t.co/2AxgNH0dRn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We don't know much about Shamgar except that he's dead and that we still have time to fill in some of our own story.  https://t.co/41tlCLl80t<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This uncensored event in the life of Israel shows that transitions and oppression are messy. The event was real, but there is also a lot of symbolism in the way they remembered it.   https://t.co/MzDLhWikqW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God wants us to seek after Him so much, He'll watch for any hardship He can use to get our attention, bring deliverance, and send in the Savior.  https://t.co/wTwikjImtY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We heard this weekend about Joshua leading after Moses, but who led Israel after Joshua?  https://t.co/38mn3DiZ5F<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When it came time for Joshua to leave Israel in the hands of the Israelites, he did what he learned from Moses. He commended them to follow the One and Only God.  https://t.co/wo7OQF66TD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you knew that 30 under 30 rockstar was going to become so amazing, would you have started mentoring them earlier? Jonathan saw David's potential and helped make him the next King, instead of himself!  https://t.co/1SB6PcCaqT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We tell and retell of God's faithfulness and His answers so that when the next generation experiences Him, they recognize Him.  https://t.co/zBVRjT9Lqx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Generation after generation, God shows Himself living and active among the people. The teaching of the previous generation helps the younger ones recognize Him.   https://t.co/ES4kdPd5mJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ferdinand, Kennedy, Vietnam, 9/11, Recession, School Shootings? Every generation has their Red Sea memorable moment.  https://t.co/Twaas1BznI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To obey is better than sacrifice has more to do with a relationship with God than keeping track of rights and wrongs.   Kingdoms rest on the difference.    https://t.co/mcsgDrMSvw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of all the names we can call people, the Bible says that we should call people Objects...of God's mercy and grace.   https://t.co/3k2GqzILDb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Paul trained Timothy in an easy way to sort out church controversies and strange teachings. His three steps would not only solve the dispute, but build up everyone's faith at the same time.    https://t.co/uIx8IFhaVR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We worship extravagantly because it‚Äôs the realistic response to who God is.  Join us this Friday, June 14th at 6:00 PM at @onelifehendo for a night of rest and worship.  https://t.co/oeM2YkVgJt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Summer in the Psalms starts today. Psalm 100-150 for the next 10 weeks, with no commentary. Sometimes the Bible reading needs to be as clean as a glass of sun tea. Join us!  https://t.co/aaZtUzhdkV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When the apostle Paul went Biblical about our awful self-control and the Savior that covers it all up.  https://t.co/fUBgT4ng2m #Addiction #Recovery<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God didn't bring on the Law so people would stop being sinful. He knew that wasn't what it would take to transform people.  https://t.co/Jux5KZvXbe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reminder we have one service at each campus tomorrow. West Campus: 10:00 AM East Campus: 11:00 AM Henderson Campus: 11:15 AM  https://t.co/3kZzsxjVlv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not that rules and laws are a bad thing, they just aren't the things that a relationship of love and grace can be built upon.  https://t.co/BmhF0PlRhS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Paul gets mad in Galatians and snarky in Romans. "So what ever came of that sinful life apart from God? How was that working for you?"  https://t.co/1MYT1tpfAT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus said a lot of things after He rose from the dead. He tried to explain to the disciples how things were different now. The best summary He gave: don't be afraid.  https://t.co/cLq6fk1fFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fear of sin and death is long gone as the imperishable life of Christ is in us.   https://t.co/e5hMexfQDe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There was an old life away from Christ that ends in death and a new life with Christ that starts with a death and leads to life.  https://t.co/fIRlIfnj1T<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We come to Christ by faith and then we start to change. The new life is brought about by Christ's work and the grace He has shown us.   https://t.co/Q2gCaljtjS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Law made the full breadth of our sin visible but it made the depth and width of God's grace visible too.  https://t.co/RPnAAuBwRB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you can see and realize that evil has made its way through every nation and society, it makes it easier to see that Jesus' salvation can also work its glorious way around the world  https://t.co/ALGoXKPCm2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Paul says someone would rarely die for a righteous person, maybe for a good person, and never for an evil person. God says, "They're all mine."  https://t.co/grZONsmwec<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not that we can resist or prevent suffering, but we can take control of what that suffering turns into. That's the power of God at work in us!   https://t.co/Y41x9GcuZ2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We've been given a thing and though we haven't fully received it, the ticket alone fills us with overwhelming hope, joy, and peace.  https://t.co/43syJJcFTd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you work for something, you expect a payment on your own terms. When you are given a gift, you are put in a spot to simply receive it and enjoy it as long as it lasts.  https://t.co/tmvkCpPAOk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When God made Abraham righteous, it was before he did anything that looked religious. The same applies to us today. Our religious works don't make us righteous, God does it before we ever get started!  https://t.co/gdL346oCjh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We don't just want to build a great church, we want to build great cities.  What an amazing day with hundreds of people out in our communities making them more beautiful on City Serve Day. Thank you for all of your hard work! #CityServeDay  https://t.co/K8DgO6X1DD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reading Romans has now led us right into preparing for Easter. Our righteousness was purchased for us and delivered by Christ Himself. Starting tomorrow, we'll move to the Gospel of John.     https://t.co/BanJfGox8j<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We did this or that great thing! But that's not what makes God love us so much. It's quite the other way around.  https://t.co/8iXhe9I8Sn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It seems weird for Paul to talk so much about us being free from the Law of Sin and death, but then to say we uphold the law...unless it's the ultimate law of salvation by faith and mercy!  https://t.co/JcQTgBAViM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God has made a way for us to be right with Him and right with the people around us. Now that He's done the work of salvation, we are free thank Him in many ways.  https://t.co/MKRFxxZyND<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Check out this week's episode of the One Life Podcast. We talked to @ZacParsonsCom. Zac is involved in multiple ways of helping build a great city.  YouTube:  https://t.co/QfmUEiyNCo Apple Podcasts:  https://t.co/HQa3omqBZT One Life Website:  https://t.co/DdQp0hH2o7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God paid for all of the wrongs we'd ever do in advance. That is *one* way the word 'propitiation' is used. The other way it is used explains God's mercy even more.  https://t.co/NBND3ONiRQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Law was good, but it couldn't save us. Now, because of Christ, we walk in freedom and love towards Jesus instead of living in fear of punishment from the Law.  https://t.co/EtRCbhtU2q<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When it comes to salvation, Good deeds are for other people to see God's work in you, not for you to stand on as a reason for salvation.  https://t.co/Uv5EZJlHov<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's hard sometimes, but what we do is always showing off what we think life in Christ looks like.  https://t.co/UlzMX8O53j<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's better than getting into Heaven because of what your Grandaddy did and not your own good deeds? Getting into Heaven because of what God did, and what He calls you to believe.   https://t.co/sHebM0xUMz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Continuing through Romans 2 as Paul talks about judgment and what happens if we hate mercy, love wrath, and judge one another.  https://t.co/Mh6bmcSCOu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Don't Judge" is a phrase that is kind of in the Bible and kind of in there but not meaning what you think it means. Here is part of Paul's explanation as he sets the stage for grace in Romans.  https://t.co/4ziMUXcg5D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Resisting God's love leads to some rough spots. Loving those that are in those rough spots can look like you approve, but that's been the risk since the beginning. #EatsWithSinners  https://t.co/tDcsq3JBKL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God will give us over to whatever we seek, if it's shame, He'll let us go for it. If it's holiness, He'll immerse us in that too. Whatever we choose, in the freedom He gives, He is trying to lead us to Himself.   https://t.co/ZBkqVAZhg0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nudged by nature to have faith in Jesus or deciding to not pay attention.  https://t.co/vrj4VJPlrv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While Paul is talking about God's wrath, he's setting up the conversation to talk about the greatness of God's grace.  https://t.co/y62BwguCJj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are plenty of things to be ashamed of when it comes to talking about church or religion, but the Gospel isn't one of them.  https://t.co/dqQUNvOLfv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Paul was "obligated" to preach the Gospel to all kinds of people. Though he gives a list, you get the feeling that he wasn't calling those people foolish barbarians to their non-religious faces.  https://t.co/ribmrVh2LE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are a lot of things that Paul teaches or shows without realizing it, like how prayer works to transform a community.  https://t.co/b6zaJ53Wl0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reputations are built on actions, and actions flow out of what we think and believe. The church in Rome was doing something right, and everyone heard about it.  https://t.co/ftsUfhTF2K<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have received... something from Jesus the King that is immeasurable but fully actionable. The Gospel is as exciting as ever.  https://t.co/Gjma3J072e<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus shows up and tells the disciples what is going to happen next. If they had any fear or wonder if they could do it, all they had to do was look and see what Jesus was already doing.  https://t.co/bf6SI59dBo #RelevantTodayToo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In this episode, we talk to Dr. Braxton Hunter.

<|startoftext|>There was a great Sunday morning where everyone that was around was a seeker.  https://t.co/ubfcjnNPw9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Joe and Nick were taking on a great risk and submitted themselves to be considered unholy and unclean on a Holy day when they did the hard work of burying Jesus.  https://t.co/VrjqYE4uy7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>John puts a lot of details into the Gospels that are worth looking up, tracking down, and then just sitting and praising Jesus.  https://t.co/lxiUjImmbU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The unexplained message of the soldiers casting lots for Jesus' shirt is a big deal. They valued clothing over a human life and probably called on other false deities and 'luck' in hopes of winning Jesus' shirt.  https://t.co/61XENa78IJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fear is a terrible guide. When one fear comes along that is bigger than another, though, our judgments can become worse and worse.  https://t.co/GsG6aZhd4H<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At some point you have to quit asking who is at fault and just take the responsibility to do something about it.   Jesus died on the cross and His unjust trial leaves us an opportunity to own our involvement.  https://t.co/wd6VeISCCW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In this episode on the One Life Podcast, we talk to Eric Cummings and Austin Maxheimer from Community One. @comm_one   Apple Podcasts  https://t.co/6kJbEvgS68    YouTube  https://t.co/uZ8Mp8yKgx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We don't tell people where to sit in church, but sometimes we decide in advance when we judge who we think should be there and who shouldn't. James needed to help his church as much as our churches need help today.  https://t.co/vAa2ORfJ1t<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You're not going to be good enough or be good at it, but do it anyway. Jesus knows all of the difficulties of the Christian life. Don't cynic yourself out before you start.  https://t.co/sChljTlTrV<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Having a full and complete knowledge of God's will would have some serious side effects. Let's go for it.  https://t.co/zxtseZa52i<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What are we known for? What is our reputation? Could that be part of what Paul was thinking about when he said "rejoice always"?  https://t.co/BilpGIjRGB<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Service time change due to winter weather tomorrow.  East / 11:00 AM Henderson / 11:15 AM West / 11:15 AM (this is a change from our normal 10:00 AM)  https://t.co/wOyRf6DzP0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>See you tonight, Middle School &amp; High School.  https://t.co/KhS9uhArhz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which translation of the Bible should you read? That's a good question, because it shows right from the start that you want to read the Bible and you want to grow in the truth.  https://t.co/QswkYqX737<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nobody likes to go through a struggle and experience grief, but those that do it right end up with a joy that is deeper and permanent when they see Jesus again at the end.  https://t.co/B2ldDGCZ2G<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Check out this weeks episode of the One Life Podcast. We talked to the Worship and The Word Movement team - they are leading us on January 26th from 8AM-Noon.  YouTube  https://t.co/7PMUxhQmtP  Apple Podcasts  https://t.co/z8EfqPd8st  Google Play  https://t.co/UpY0hwdKoU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Preparation in advance helps us have the discipline to do things we don't feel like doing.  https://t.co/B3PSDhRQuJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus was preparing the disciples (and us!) for a time when we'd be able to talk to God even better than they talked to Jesus ever before. Better than face to face!  https://t.co/2zsN63mvk7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Check out this week‚Äôs episode of the One Life Podcast where we interact with @mbweaver43 - you can listen wherever you find podcasts or watch via YouTube.   https://t.co/GiASahThbh  #onelifepodcast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's easy to read the Gospels and think the disciples were dense buffoons for not understanding what Jesus said so clearly, but they were hearing it and reacting to it in real time. They couldn't go back to re-read slowly.  https://t.co/jMiSMKhjg7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many people were waiting for the salvation of Israel and the world, but Simeon knew how to react when HE showed up: Worship, praise, and thanksgiving!  https://t.co/oTXZiAMOyT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even when it came to the aftermath of His death, Jesus was fulfilling prophecies from the Old Testament.  https://t.co/t6CHVXbzMM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus faced His temptations with victory from His birth to His death. He can relate to anything we would bring Him. That's the miracle of Christmas.  https://t.co/bNLnO7hYbl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the Old Testament Laws were rules for engagement, Jesus' sacrifice created the joyful relationship of union with God. We express and live our faith in a whole new way with our sins completely forgiven!  https://t.co/UJX69q1wov<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pilate was starting to believe something, but it wasn't enough to affect his actions.  https://t.co/t420r0z5zU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One event after another, written down and preserved so that we'd be encouraged to have hope.  https://t.co/nzWc61ojo6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Lord and Ruler of the whole world had to live a life like ours so He could die a death like no other. It wasn't an accident, it was intentional, for God's glory.  https://t.co/ORaeAb2Xtb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are a lot of times that Jesus showed His plans through the lens of an Old Testament Prophet. The fullness of what was about to happen was in the bit that wasn't quoted.  https://t.co/llV3WWflh6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The best way to keep a victory a victory is to talk about it, remember it, celebrate it, and re-celebrate it until the next one comes along.  https://t.co/kEGeuDcfUU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus knew what His kingdom was all about and He knew how it was going to advance.  https://t.co/N4Pv7FyrQI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is a new priesthood, and it is great. It's as great as the new covenant is greater than the old one. It is as great as life and peace winning out over law and death.  https://t.co/Qbjwi3PthM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God has been working His way into our lives in many different ways since the beginning. Through grace, through buildings, through people, and through His own self.  https://t.co/ASTa2XOlll<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's like that distant cousin or the in-law that lives far away, only a whole lot better. God wants to come, visit, and stay with us. A lot.   https://t.co/S8bwMMERwK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's Thanksgiving! Do it and bring a bunch of others along with you!  https://t.co/u1kTrsTBld<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When looking to hire a shepherd, you'd want to hire the fella that had bear claw scars instead of the one with the gold watch.  https://t.co/k5Szopsv5s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You might know that someone is praying for you, but did you know JESUS prayed for you?  https://t.co/riJivn5Gil<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus talked about the Bible all of the time. We get so much more out of the scriptures when we discuss them with one another.  https://t.co/MZGoYCA3pe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aaron showed off the relentless grace of God in the face of judgment and the consequences of sin.  https://t.co/obfj1pbYGU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This one is for those who are and may one-day be Missionary Parents. #TheLordProvides  https://t.co/n81qYCR36n<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The whole long story of God and mankind is one of people, who change a lot, receiving new ways to interact with an unchanging, loving, God.   https://t.co/2tHDQjGyOz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Old Testament scriptures even got the attention of other people in other parts of the Old Testament. Must be worth taking a look.  https://t.co/4boYEZlvEG #Shadows #BeforeTheManger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What if you had a booklet that came from God for your benefit? Would you read it? Would you read all of it?  https://t.co/7NJYvTIIUZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes when Jesus talked to a crowd, He had to talk to multiple groups at the same time. Don't let that distract you from the GOOD NEWS as you read the Gospels.  https://t.co/EMypt9QwhB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God has spoken to the world in a lot of ways. One way is through creation, another through the scriptures, but they all point to one Messenger that was, Himself, the message.  https://t.co/dhJ4h1u4jx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reading the Bible is a relationship builder, teacher, puzzle, and cheerleader.  https://t.co/cN37dccDdI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If anyone is in Christ, they are a new creation. We identify with Him in baptism and He'll identify with us in resurrection!  https://t.co/Z2bY4YnxZH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus insisted that John baptize Him and John did it. It was just the beginning of Jesus convincing us that He was fully God and fully Man.  https://t.co/USr8sZfAeN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When Jesus healed this Jewish guy of Leprosy, He was setting of a chain of events that He hoped would make it all of the way into the inmost chambers of the Levitical Priesthood.  https://t.co/KbUqBh39P1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus knew He would get everyone's attention by healing a paralyzed man, but the man's sins were more important. He took care of the sin, then He took care of the man.  https://t.co/vKHCfx42QN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Peter, after an exhausting and worthless day of work, stayed after to host a public teacher, then humored The Guy and went back to work. Jesus' response was miraculous.  https://t.co/o0xUkrAb8P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Correct each other or treat each other like sinners. There is a lot to these words from Jesus.  https://t.co/b0nZqcPnA0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When Jesus tells us to obey out of love, He's giving us a way to express our deepest feelings.  https://t.co/MXhAfdEAoM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How God responds to our response to His love.  https://t.co/wO0CXo1Yjd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It took quite a conversation to get Nicodemus to go from the hard work of the Law to the mysterious life in the Spirit.  https://t.co/wio0fCJNUh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you've tried as hard as you can to make yourself clean, Jesus shows up, makes your cleanliness irrelevant, and replaces it with joy.  https://t.co/EDCp2PnF9J<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you are without joy, it is easy to not know what to do next. Mary gives us a tip, and it served those servants well.  https://t.co/qtZgA4omgE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For many people, belief in Jesus isn't an intellectual ascent, but a relief. They find that Jesus is the *thing* they've been searching for and wanting all their lives.  https://t.co/ly4tRQn5yT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>John knew that God would show him who the Messiah was. When it happened, it didn't even matter that it was a relative, the Messiah was there!  https://t.co/y8CJkwRVji<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What do you do to get ready for a baptism? John the Baptist baptized people.  https://t.co/AGu0VeMuQH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Law was super good, and had a lot of importance and need, but grace and truth won out. They were so important God had to bring them Himself.  https://t.co/olawkkpXvA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes David would leave a pattern for us in the Psalms: Reflect on God's work, Imagine the future of the Kingdom, get out there and make it happen.  https://t.co/tGmciCChQU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When something in the Bible doesn't seem relevant to where you are now, read it and wait. It might get better in time, or be perfectly available for you when you need it most.  https://t.co/lErsPuPCgj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stepping out with the Gospel like all of your sins are forgiven, your needs are provided, and you get to be with God forever.  https://t.co/fvTQlXP5SC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When transgression or sin speaks to us deep in our souls, God is hanging around, patiently faithful, to help us choose His voice instead.  https://t.co/w7collwY3U<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When explaining how killer awesome God is, you need to know some cultural clues. In this Psalm, David talks about shields, spears, javelins, and other goodies.  https://t.co/hTptoYhNQR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What if we acted like people that had been rescued by the crazy love and forgiveness of the God of the Universe?  https://t.co/bTFJiRJLVQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What if we worship God for all of the things He brought us through while we were going through it today and tomorrow? (sorry for the time-travel grammar issues)  https://t.co/5RKB6PWx9X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While everything is going crazy around us, and we could seek after so many wonderful things, one thing beats them all.  https://t.co/ihoTHBmqV2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plead my case because of my holiness, Lord! Sometimes that is hard to pray, but it doesn't have to be.  https://t.co/x5anA2WB2A<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Bible is full of guides to pray, and the intent of every one of those prayers is to lead us to God Himself.  https://t.co/ZDcRF0PcW2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Psalm 23, nothing against funeral homes, but that's not how that Psalm was written.  https://t.co/dvXjS706eZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Praying and feeling like God isn't listening doesn't mean He isn't. It just means it feels like He isn't.  https://t.co/v8lruLlv8j<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reading and praying through the psalms can show you all new ways to pray for others. (And yourself, if you talk about yourself in the 3rd person.)  https://t.co/68kBBK7QWl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We might not depend on chariots today, but there are other things that we can be free from to let God do His salvation work.  https://t.co/q94szH6vu2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When David called God his fortress and his rock, he was looking at 30 years of his own history, and 1000s of years of God's history. God has worked a long time for our salvation and deliverance.  https://t.co/StYY7CApJM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes it feels weird to pray the psalms. I can't tell God to answer my according to *my* righteousness!!  That's when you realize you're praying with someone else...  https://t.co/hHgP1PiPj4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thinking about the Lord changes the way we look at everything else, even when everything else is trying to change the way we look at the Lord.  https://t.co/QiWeHBTAMr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing shows off the greatness of God like when His people stay faithful to Him through hard times.  https://t.co/P8pOzYWCaJ #WorthIt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everything we take in has an effect on us. If only we had control of what we consumed with our eyes and ears...  https://t.co/VDuA3MgRZb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When we try to pray the Psalms, consider the many ways they were prayed. Sometimes it was with a singing prophecy staff of 288 men!  https://t.co/EcmVanXreN  #CallUpTheSonsOfKorah #GetThisPartyStarted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Praying the Psalms and meditating on the Lord can make you feel like you are totally unlike the Lord. That's true and good. The Lord shows you even more mercy anyway.  https://t.co/lrEh10sveI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's easy to read some of these Psalms and think "this doesn't apply to me!" It's sad to say, but just wait. Strengthen your love for the Lord like shepherd David did, so you're ready for hard days like King David.  https://t.co/pko25095jy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are Psalms of teaching, prayer, devotion, thanksgiving, and more. You'd have to read 4 every weekday to finish the book this summer. We're going to take it slow, like a tree next to a river.  https://t.co/d5wkfQAgZK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pray all the time, but how? Paul gives us some exhortations and here are some tips to turn a normal day into a prayer-filled plan of action.  https://t.co/7db6VHtA9R<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As Paul compares the Christian life to Roman armor, things get intense when it's time to talk about helmets, swords, salvation, and the Word of God.  https://t.co/U13K0igM9z<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you have questions about prayer or the Christian life, look at how Jesus and Paul described it. It can turn that dinnertime prayer into daily prayer.  https://t.co/uTLLGUkaxM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus taught about the Kingdom of Heaven from the world around Him. Paul talked about the Christian Life from the same playbook.  https://t.co/i3HTBb9bVz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you always read it as a spiritual warfare thing, read it today as part of responding to the grace of God and serving one another. Be strong in the Lord.  https://t.co/fJtfMtKhsa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As we serve one another in love, we show off who we are serving. Before you saw it in #Solo, you saw it in the scriptures: Everyone serves somebody.  https://t.co/1PBxz1TgK5 #NoSpoilers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good parenting, good kidding, good aunt and uncleing, all lies in building our reverence and love for Christ first.  https://t.co/5eJFAwxcEH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just like a day at the Fall Festival or a day at the gym, a husband's life affects how his whole family grows. Spiritual growth must be deliberate.   https://t.co/Vg7HRMeEl4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Submit to one another is often left off of the "Submit to your husbands" statements. It's all about building the kingdom of heaven and showing off Jesus, not about how you like your eggs cooked.  https://t.co/SHcaB22ivi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God wants to lead us with all that He has instructed, and with all of the Spirit with which we are equipped. Let's not waste any bit of it.  https://t.co/twsRiLlo1Q<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have a choice about the things we do and the lifestyle in which we live. God holds out opportunity for us, because the evil world is watching and looking for answers.  https://t.co/uqrQISAomK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are a lot of ways to expose sin in people. The part that is our job is more about what we expose in ourselves, though, so put the bullhorn away.  https://t.co/uqDDOcM1M9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The 'weight' of our words depends entirely on the life we live behind those words. That's why Paul cautions us to not be deceived by 'empty' words.  https://t.co/5NsA5Z7zKI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jokes, comedy, tall tales, and all kinds of humor can join us together or pull us apart. God's Spirit is in us to pull us together with our words and build each other up.  https://t.co/Ofi8COwyYo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Learning to live by Christ's life as a servant to others doesn't come easy or natually, but it can be taught and empowered by the Holy Spirit.  https://t.co/30IY3LV0iu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Christ makes us spiritually clean and helps us take off that old lifestyle of filth. The new life in Him is joy and peace... and a process.  https://t.co/R8A6hDMfhQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The way Christians are different is part of the path to see how life in God is different. That's why we change. That's why we are made new.  https://t.co/LGjg4FVrzd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is a tipping-point where you realize you get the most out of Christ and His life when you quit trying to get it all for yourself.  https://t.co/5Mu5onQhrW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is a way to survive the Christian Best Seller list, the 'did you hear' club on Facebook, and Fad Christianity. It depends on all of us growing up together.  https://t.co/MxBl8Hbfz5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That pastoral staff, those folks visiting the hospitals and teaching, they aren't the workers, we are. We all are.  https://t.co/VH7YpbJgNh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How would our prayer, boldness, faith, and hope change if we realized Jesus has a "Go wherever I want and give whatever gifts I want" card?  https://t.co/lUbTok7Rwb #CaptivesSetFree<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What if there were only one church in town? What kind of music would they play? Would they read their prayers? Wear robes? Play electric guitars? A: All of the above.  https://t.co/a7oOo7RdhO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Walking in a way that is worthy of God's glory isn't impossible. God spelled it out in ways we can understand step by step.  https://t.co/MG1HHmIQ24<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God is able and is doing more than we can imagine in the Church and in Christ for generation after generation.  https://t.co/zVBVtAQl2n<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rooted in love, with Christ dwelling in us, we can grasp the fullness of God.  https://t.co/SMemgCUNM7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bold, confident access. The difference between waiting on the curb for the door to open, knocking, or busting open the front door with prayer.  https://t.co/wAsQOj1a0K<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The wisdom of God is shown as He uses the people He saves to get the word out to others that they can be saved too.  https://t.co/tMFQNMEz9d<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The mystery of Christ uniting all who call on His name is a mystery that can't help but make itself clear.  https://t.co/mxtxXry2Xn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What he knew was that Jesus had saved him from the worst of everything, prepared for him the best of everything, and that he wanted to tell others about it.  https://t.co/prchAtDRmr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The way the temple of Solomon was built had a secret. It was a picture of how we'd be made for Heaven on Earth.  https://t.co/9XgJUkz3h8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not a non-resident alien life of "Am I allowed to do this?" It's a life of "What are Dad and I going to do today?" as a part of God's household.  https://t.co/jYBJeMXfhn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The blood that saves is the blood that joins us. All who believe that the events of Easter Morning are true are united equally into one big covenant family.  https://t.co/7jmEQgUFDW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As Paul talks about what Christians are, Jesus is of course the super perfect example. All of His works were a gift to enable us to do good too.  https://t.co/wDrl5aFZY7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The truth about why today is called #MaundyThursday? Are you sure you can handle the truth?  https://t.co/m8Wi6fEioW   John called it "Loving them to the end."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God's power could be compared to a lot of things, but Paul says it showed the most on Easter, and every day in us.  https://t.co/xKAFp9Ya2I<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's the kind of "if you only knew the power" kind of hope. Bigger than finding an extra gear on your corvette or the little wishes that you'd win the lottery.  https://t.co/vhgajz38gt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you ever wondered how or what to pray for somebody, there is an excellent answer in Ephesians.  https://t.co/W3yAfosH7w<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When a neighbor moves in, it changes the neighborhood. When the Holy Spirit moves in, He changes a person.  https://t.co/QHBbl5xpiT<|endoftext|>
