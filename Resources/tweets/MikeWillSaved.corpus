<|startoftext|>@theangiestanton While I do appreciate what you‚Äôre trying to accomplish. We need more strong Black make leaders in our community.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYCPBA What did the Police do about it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tkag2020_ann @McDonalds Funny how Cops can‚Äôt handle the pressure of feeling like the whole is against them. Something Blacks felt their entire lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tkag2020_ann @McDonalds Oh you want a break now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYPDShea @NYPDPSA8 Guns should be legal in NYC they‚Äôre our 2nd Amendment right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYPDShea Did you know that guns are perfectly legal in this Country and are easily obtained in many states? In fact they‚Äôre a constitutional right. Any gun owner can point a gun at his spouse...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYPDShea It‚Äôs always about the money allocated by taxpayers***<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theangiestanton No they shouldn‚Äôt unless the suspect is armed with a lethal weapon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindaSuhler @NYCPBA No one is saying this is legitimate. What‚Äôs being expressed is that every action has a reaction. This is how very upset and angry citizens are responding to the constant harrasment and violence perpetuated by Police, especially the NYPD.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nathansgreen @BretWeinstein @CHSommers The idea that this isn‚Äôt the reality would be the dishonest conversation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BretWeinstein @CHSommers What‚Äôs the dishonest conversation?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYPDnews Making sure we‚Äôre safe or making sure they‚Äôre making their quotas so they keep directing our taxes to their pockets?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBudden How do you equate being Pro-Trump with being Anti-Black? Can please elaborate. Also, can you name one policy that Trump has implemented that negatively effects Black Americans?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w_terrence Police in America have too much power. No we shouldn‚Äôt get rid of them but they definitely need to be downsized and the power needs to be returned to the people they are here to serve.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DougNMarco @magaroni01 @theangiestanton So because Blacks kill Blacks that means police can kill us and harass us as well? How can you not see this flawed logic? Let‚Äôs not forget they‚Äôre civil servant workers and are here to serve the public so they should be held to higher standard than civilians.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DougNMarco @magaroni01 @theangiestanton This is about Police constant harassment of the Black community we‚Äôre tired. Yes it‚Äôs a shame that Black people kill one another and we have our own things we need to work on/address within the community but that will come later. Police brutality needs to be addressed now.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SH0WTIM3xx @theangiestanton Honestly I believe it‚Äôs more of an economic status problem.

Nonetheless ones rights shouldn‚Äôt be defined by their financial status.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SH0WTIM3xx @theangiestanton I do blame democratic policies for the harassment of minorities in democratic cities but I do acknowledge that the US as whole often turns a blind eye to Blacks and Law enforcement in general. The right has a biased opinion when in comes to Police. This is the root of the problem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JLPtalk True but they didn‚Äôt build it alone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SH0WTIM3xx @theangiestanton Or you just need to acknowledge the fact that Blacks are treated differently when it comes to the law. The NYPD‚Äôs handling of social distancing orders is a perfect example.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Cooler710 @AnarchyApe @Iamsock @frkmgnt1 @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur What's his? I'll add him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnarchyApe @Cooler710 @Iamsock @frkmgnt1 @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur Who said it wasn't? Blocking someone from expressing their views isn't public shaming them.. It's blocking them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnarchyApe @Cooler710 @Iamsock @frkmgnt1 @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur But I'm off this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnarchyApe @Cooler710 @Iamsock @frkmgnt1 @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur Yeah it's a real "tree stump" argument to believe everyone had the right to express their views &amp; beliefs without being blocked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cooler710 @Iamsock @frkmgnt1 @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur Do not the Left call themselves the Left &amp; the Right, the Right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cooler710 @Iamsock @frkmgnt1 @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur Yes my understanding that everyone has the right to express their views &amp; opinions is a grade school understanding, superior being.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @Cooler710 @frkmgnt1 @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur Ok now I got better things to do like play my PS4, you guys enjoy your day and hopefully wake up from your Leftist bubble.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cooler710 @Iamsock @frkmgnt1 @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur Yeah but my point is I don't buy into his nonsense but you assumed I did b/c of leftist propaganda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @Cooler710 @frkmgnt1 @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur My own independent research from different news sources than I reach my conclusion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cooler710 @Iamsock @frkmgnt1 @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur I don't watch Alex Jones either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cooler710 @Iamsock @frkmgnt1 @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur I don't even watch FOX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @frkmgnt1 @Cooler710 @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur No, I said your view that every1 who disagrees with you is nuts comes from leftist propaganda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cooler710 @Iamsock @frkmgnt1 @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur Yeah when you have no argument you begin spouting nonsense to divert. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frkmgnt1 @Cooler710 @Iamsock @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur Yeah this is what your leader @cenkuygur has brainwashed you to believe. Every1 that see thru Leftist nonsense is nuts. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cooler710 @Iamsock @frkmgnt1 @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur You do have the right to have money... What is your point? Oh you have none so you begin trolling. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cooler710 @Iamsock @frkmgnt1 @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur Numerous videos on YouTube and in real life I've seen Antifa &amp; BLM become violent. TYT just did a story. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @Cooler710 @frkmgnt1 @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur You have the right to own your own gun. You don't have the right to take mine. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @Cooler710 @frkmgnt1 @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur Yes you can have your event but you don't have the right to shut down MY event. See the difference? #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cooler710 @Iamsock @frkmgnt1 @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur Most of the violent protests I've seen over recent years came from the Left. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @Cooler710 @frkmgnt1 @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur So you have the right to shut down another citizens event. That's not infringing on their rights? #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cooler710 @Iamsock @frkmgnt1 @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur Yeah I know. That's why he's in prison... No relevance. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cooler710 @Iamsock @frkmgnt1 @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur Like I said, I already clarified my meaning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cooler710 @frkmgnt1 @Iamsock @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur So I don't have the right to host an event without someone coming to shut it down? #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @Cooler710 @frkmgnt1 @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur And love to become violent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cooler710 @Iamsock @frkmgnt1 @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur Ok this isn't court and I already clarified my meaning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @Cooler710 @frkmgnt1 @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur Typical leftist... #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cooler710 @frkmgnt1 @Iamsock @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur So I have free speech but I don't have the right to express it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @frkmgnt1 @Cooler710 @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur I didn't instigate. I was stating where you can see me in person if you don't believe I'm real.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cooler710 @frkmgnt1 @Iamsock @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur So I have the right to free speech but I don't have the right to express it? Do you see the flaw in your logic? #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cooler710 @Iamsock @frkmgnt1 @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur Yes but if I'm hosting a public venue YOU don't have the right to shut it down. That's the point. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @frkmgnt1 @Cooler710 @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur Definitely my name. I'm in Brooklyn anytime you wanna see me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BoucherKc No, allow them to speak as they should allow you to speak. Not shout at each other. Pure ignorance. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cooler710 @Iamsock @frkmgnt1 @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur Private businesses and public events are two different things. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @Kikarasu @frkmgnt1 @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur Somehow I think you still will remain a childish shout me down instead of have a conversation Lib. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cooler710 @frkmgnt1 @Iamsock @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur It gives me the right to express it. How can I express it if you're shouting me down? #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kikarasu @frkmgnt1 @Iamsock @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur Yeah FACTS &amp; LOGIC = Trolling to childish thinking liberals. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cooler710 @Iamsock @frkmgnt1 @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur Guess what, I know... #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @frkmgnt1 @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur We both have the right to express views &amp; opinions. If you're stopping another person from doing this, you're block their speech. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frkmgnt1 @Iamsock @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur No YOU guys are in DENIAL and wish to maintain your childish interpretation of the 1st amendment which allows you to block speech. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frkmgnt1 @Iamsock @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur You can challenge my speech but you can't block it, HUGE difference. Shouting ppl down is blocking their speech. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @frkmgnt1 @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur No you do not have the right to block my speech. This is the problem with liberal logic. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frkmgnt1 @Iamsock @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur Doesn't say that those permits were for that specific day... Just that they had permits. Could be for other events. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @frkmgnt1 @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur Yes you do but you certainly don't have the right to shout me down and block me from talking. Do you see? #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frkmgnt1 @Iamsock @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur What's the whole point of having free speech if people aren't allowing you to speak? #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @frkmgnt1 @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur Yeah, lets all just have a shouting much and see how that turns out. Oh that;s right, chaos, violence, &amp; murder... #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frkmgnt1 @Iamsock @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur The Government also has the responsibility to protect your speech. Privately owned business doesn't apply to public grounds. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frkmgnt1 @Iamsock @AN_Tibs @cenkuygur They did not have permits. U guys just don't wanna admit you're WRONG  &amp; wish to maintain your childish views of having shouting matches.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @frkmgnt1 @cenkuygur This is the most stupidest and childish interpretation of the 1st Amendment. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @AN_Tibs @frkmgnt1 @cenkuygur No this is why we have permits etc. to maintain order. U don't have the right to disrupt other ppl's events. U have the right to ur own.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @frkmgnt1 @cenkuygur Yes you do but you don't have the right to BLOCK ME from holding my event or interrupt it. That's not free speech. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frkmgnt1 @Iamsock @cenkuygur You don't have the right to come and disrupt my rally and claim free speech. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frkmgnt1 @Iamsock @cenkuygur The government must also protect your rights, free speech being one of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frkmgnt1 @Iamsock @cenkuygur How can someone express their views &amp; opinions if another person is shouting them down? They're essentially blocking their speech. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frkmgnt1 @Iamsock @cenkuygur This is the intention of Free Speech. To let every person be able to express their views &amp; opinions. I didn't make that up. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @cenkuygur This is the problem with the Left. They think Free Speech means talking over people which essentially blocks that persons speech. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @cenkuygur What? How? Let me finish talking and you talk after. That's how you have a humane conversation. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @cenkuygur Yes you can. You don't have the right to disrupt my rally. We all get a chance to express our view. Not at the same time. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @cenkuygur R u in that much denial? Free Speech means allowing someone to express their views and opinions. Talking over someone blocks that. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @cenkuygur This sort of thinking is childish and incorrect usage of free speech. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @cenkuygur Talking over someone is just another method of blocking ones speech. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @cenkuygur Yes it does because you are not allowing them to speak. What's the point of having Speech if people are going to talk over you? #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @cenkuygur Yes that's exactly what it means. Allowing someone to speak and have their own views. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes @cenkuygur Free Speech entitles allowing a person to speak. Not talking over them or blocking them from speaking. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shouting people down is not speech. Allowing someone to speak is speech., Not talking over people.  #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur If you're claiming Bribery than why not pursue the case.. You're a lawyer. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This call for removing statues isn't just about the Confederacy.. They're after the Founding Fathers to undermine the Constitution. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @cenkuygur Dems are the ones always trying to divide the Country and recreate the Constitution. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @cenkuygur Yeah because Facts = Trolling to the snowflake left. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is TYT going to report on the NAACP &amp; Al Sharpton calling to remove George Washington Statues? Or the defacing of the Abe Lincoln ? #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So what's TYT's opinion on Al Sharpton &amp; the Left removing George Washington statues? Or are yours not gonna report on that? #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur By Confederacy do you mean Democrats? Funny how they're the ones always after the Constitution. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur Yeah we know the Left loves to shut down any debate. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does TYT report on anything else it Donald Trump for 2 hours? #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ajplus Agreed, no one has the right to try to silence ones speech because they don't like it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billyrunaway @cenkuygur @realDonaldTrump Are you referring to the Election? If so more doesn't mean win in the Presidential Election. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur And the entire ideology of the Left is based off fear of White men. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is he hurting other people? Are you talking about feelings? Sorry feelings aren't protected under the law. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So it's ok to threaten people with violence b/c you don't agree with them? #TYTLive @cenkuygur<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billyrunaway @cenkuygur @realDonaldTrump You either win the vote or lose the vote. That's how it works... #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yankee_Ram No, few claim to be Christians. The Leaders of the movement are Atheist. The Leaders are responsible for the movement. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billyrunaway @cenkuygur @realDonaldTrump Like I said the problem isn't wanting them down, it's illegally tearing them down. It's not what you do, it's how you do it.. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yankee_Ram No many are not. Richard Spencer &amp; David Duke are self proclaimed Atheist. The leaders of those movements. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billyrunaway @cenkuygur @realDonaldTrump If those people wanted to honor their ancestors. They have every right to. Everything isn't as black &amp; white as you Libs make it. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billyrunaway @cenkuygur @realDonaldTrump Look I don't even care about those statues but you can't go around tearing things down you don't like. There's proper ways to do things. 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billyrunaway @cenkuygur @realDonaldTrump What your not wrapping your head around is they both are equally guilty in participating in slavery. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur You mean the people that were legally participating there 1st ammend rights and the people that weren't? #TYTLIve<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billyrunaway @cenkuygur @realDonaldTrump I'm looking to protect anyone I'm saying is they weren't the only side that was guilty by today standards in all this. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billyrunaway @cenkuygur @realDonaldTrump They were still slave owners.. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kate12402 @stevenoh88 The elite didn't create these religion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lol @cenkuygur so no counter argument to Donald @realDonaldTrump statements? Just name calling. Typical Liberal tactic. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock I wasn't referring to myself, I was referring to the people who weren't Nazi's marching. But I do support their right to speech. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I support destroying bad ideas with better ideas, not with violence. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I support the right to speech, even from Nazi's. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BoucherKc @ThatSpanishLady Good counter argument. Usually something the left comes up with. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur And you're a left wing communist propagandist provocateur #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's proper venues to go thru to remove those statues. You can't just go around tearing things down you don't like. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too bad those Alt-Right White Nationalist Nazi's are ATHEIST. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @cenkuygur Yeah because I said all science is fantasy or was I alluding to the scientific theories about the beginning of our universe?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThatSpanishLady You ever heard of the term the enemy of your enemy is your friend? I imagine that is what's happening here b/c of the Left. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @cenkuygur I understand the definition of Science. By that definition most of these theories don't hold up. They're all man mad fantasies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur Too bad those Alt-Right White Nationalist Nazi's are ATHEIST. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those White Nationalist Nazi's don't even embrace Christianity &amp; aren't even Christian. Ask them yourself. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @cenkuygur Scientist are better off just admitting they have no idea how the universe began.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @cenkuygur Ok well some of the popular scientist today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @cenkuygur Better yet here are some theories coming out of the mouths of your favorite scientist.  https://t.co/3f7jKorXwa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @cenkuygur The Big Bang. Aliens... etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Islam tells its followers to take over the world by conquest.. Two different ideologies, it's not hard to understand. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Bible doesn't tell it's followers to kill everyone. It says GOD will kill all evil doers when he returns. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @cenkuygur A lot of theories these Scientist produce or nothing more than fairy tales &amp; fantasies. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's Islam... @cenkuygur The religion itself teachings this kind of behavior. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where you there @cenkuygur ? Some of these "Scientist" tell some of the biggest fairy tales... #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanaLBriggs @cenkuygur Not all statues are not symbols of ideology. Statues serve a variety of different purposes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WmCrosson @steelhamster @frkmgnt1 @DonteDahOne @Iamsock White Nationalist are hardly my enemy. They're nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frkmgnt1 @steelhamster @DonteDahOne @Iamsock I watch and listen to independent and non-bias, as much as they can be, media.  https://t.co/oYa10HFNBG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now you can't even get a haircut... This stuff is ridiculous. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frkmgnt1 @steelhamster @DonteDahOne @Iamsock Who cares what they say... They can believe Fish can Fly. That doesn't mean anything to me. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steelhamster @frkmgnt1 @DonteDahOne @Iamsock From the YouTube videos I've seen more people were putting the blame on Antifa showing up and causing trouble. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone can get their own guns, get their permits, and have their own rallies &amp; marches.. Why must you try stop others #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur So showing up to someones rally and  trying to shut it down is free speech? Or is that trying to block someones speech? #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frkmgnt1 @steelhamster @DonteDahOne @Iamsock They didn't even have to be there... They could've got their own guns and had their rallies &amp; marches. SIMPLE #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steelhamster @frkmgnt1 @DonteDahOne @Iamsock They don't have too. WE DO. Unless I do.They can't stop my speech no more than I can stop theirs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frkmgnt1 @steelhamster @DonteDahOne @Iamsock Yes he did take it way too far but that doesn't mean the ppl who showed up there being provocateurs and agitating the crowd aren't wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frkmgnt1 @steelhamster @DonteDahOne @Iamsock They didn't attack first. Thats the point. The showed up to THEIR event looking for trouble not the other way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frkmgnt1 @steelhamster @DonteDahOne @Iamsock I'm condemning you for standing against Free Speech which is a bigger evil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frkmgnt1 @steelhamster @DonteDahOne @Iamsock They were practicing their 1st &amp; 2nd amendment right. ANYONE can do it. I'm being honest with myself unlike most ppl. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frkmgnt1 @steelhamster @DonteDahOne @Iamsock They showed up ready to defend themselves. Antifa came to their rally to start a fight and cause trouble. Its sad that I have to defend them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frkmgnt1 @steelhamster @DonteDahOne @Iamsock No both sides did not have permits... They just showed up and was looking for trouble. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frkmgnt1 @steelhamster @DonteDahOne @Iamsock They aren't showing up to protest trying to shut them down is the point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steelhamster @frkmgnt1 @DonteDahOne @Iamsock Also, they can't deny you from protesting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steelhamster @frkmgnt1 @DonteDahOne @Iamsock Ok so you don't need permission to protest. You shouldn't need permission to own a gun either<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frkmgnt1 @steelhamster @DonteDahOne @Iamsock That doesn't count as the right blocking them from speaking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steelhamster @frkmgnt1 @DonteDahOne @Iamsock Also most of the time those people don't go thru the proper channels.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steelhamster @frkmgnt1 @DonteDahOne @Iamsock The point is people don't show up and try to stop them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steelhamster @frkmgnt1 @DonteDahOne @Iamsock The right didn't Block anything. OWS was shut down by the Democratic City of NY.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frkmgnt1 @steelhamster @DonteDahOne @Iamsock Mayor Bloomberg sanctioned that in the DEMOCRATIC state of NY. My city.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frkmgnt1 @steelhamster @DonteDahOne @Iamsock Policing showing up an attacking ppl is different from ppl showing up &amp; attacking ppl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @steelhamster @DonteDahOne I'm talking about Antifa who showed up to the White Nationalist march and began attacking them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @steelhamster @DonteDahOne The point is ppl on the right don't show up &amp; try to stop their protest. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steelhamster @DonteDahOne @Iamsock Occupy Wallstreet, BLM, etc. I'm talking about now, not 50+ years ago. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonteDahOne @Iamsock @steelhamster No, they wouldn't. They never showed up at any Left Wing Protest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No one batted an eye when the New Black PP marched with their guns.  #TYTLive   https://t.co/PA8vc5TWHd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steelhamster @Iamsock @DonteDahOne So I could slap everyone with a LGBT flag...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All this video proves is that these people aren't to be feared so why do you guys keep fear mongering? #TYTLive #LetThemMarch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @tedderukan What? That's not even the same kind of analogy. No one showed up an Antifa rally physically attacking them. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedderukan I didn't spin anything. You're so full of crap. You have no argument or excuse. I'm BLACK idc about no damn Nazi's. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedderukan People can believe any dumb thing they want as long as they don't physical action like the Left has been doing. #TYTLive 2/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedderukan Im not backing anything. I'm back their right to have it. &amp; nothing is criminal thinking Whites are superior. #TYTLive 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedderukan What? How is someone marching attacking &amp; intimidating you? You're they aggressor not the victim. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedderukan Yes you do but you don't have the right to stop someone else from doing so.. Antifa didn't go thru proper procedures.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Antifa showed up there to fight. White Nationalist showed up there to fight back. That's the difference. #TYTLive @cenkuygur<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedderukan Yes you are but you don't have the right to show up at my rally and attack me for it or try to block me from having it. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>White Nationalist aren't trying to stop the Left from speaking.. 2/2 #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The view of each side are irrelevant. The point is they all have the right to express them. 1/2 #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steelhamster Yes the Left is responsible for antagonizing &amp; blocking people from/for expressing their opinions. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @steelhamster @DonteDahOne What at are you talking about?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur No blame the Left for anatonizing free speech &amp; embracing identity politics. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @steelhamster @DonteDahOne Which is exactly what you should do when White Nationalist march. Not attack them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @steelhamster @DonteDahOne Twitter is a private company &amp; you're not blocking me from speaking just yourself from hearing it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur George Washington owned slaves. The White House was built by slaves. Why not burn that down too? #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonteDahOne @steelhamster ISIS or anyone else that is marching can march. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steelhamster @DonteDahOne You don't have persmission to block someone's speech. Do you not understand? #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur Nothing is wrong with taking down monuments but you have to go thru the legal process. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonteDahOne @steelhamster Permits mean nothing? So you have the right to illegally infringe yourself on someone's gathering? #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonteDahOne @steelhamster Permits mean nothing? Do you hear yourself? So you have the right to illegal infringe on someone's gathering?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonteDahOne @cenkuygur Yeah but they do not represent Republicans or Conservative values in any shape or form. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cactusrx Yeah controlling the way everyone thinks and speaks is working against communism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stop calling these Liberals Socialist &amp; call them what they really are... COMMUNIST #DoSomethingGOP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stop letting these Globalist Communist Liberal Democrats &amp; their mainstream media control the narrative.  #DoSomethingGOP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steelhamster @cenkuygur This isn't WWII #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steelhamster Trying to stop someone from speaking is more than condemning them. They had the right to be there. Antifa didn't. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur is a Global Communist that wants us to live in a Police State governed by his ideologies. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur Why do republicans gotta denounce White nationalists &amp; nazi's? #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur You don't have to agree with someone to defend their right to say it. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes @cenkuygur White Nationalist also have the right to speech. What's so hard to understand? #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CenkUygur Is trying to make this fringe movement represent all of the Right &amp; Conservatives. What a lying propagandist. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur  As you just said "they organized the rally" they had every right to be there. Antifa didn't. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur Oh be quiet you don't call any shots @cenkuygur<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur @realDonaldTrump And you lack the intellect to articulate your political views with an opposing party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cthagod What are they doing for the Black community?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cthagod @lilbabyzak No one is demonizing him. He's simply wrong &amp; refuses to admit it. You shouldn't call bad or racist Whites crackas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cthagod @GringoMacho29 Funny when you were wrong against the Trannys you apologized &amp; cleared the air. Whites not so much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cthagod @GringoMacho29 What do you call the Black ppl who believe they're superior than Whites &amp; spew hatred against them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cthagod So conservative Blacks are a joke?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur The gathering itself was not a terrorist act. It was a protest that got out of hand #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur The government cannot condemn a persons speech if it doesn't threaten the use of violence. People can disagree. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur The other sides are BLM, Antifa, LGBT, and all other radical leftist groups. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur They're Nazi's &amp; White Nationalist SO WHAT. Our laws aren't &amp; that's all that matters. #TYTLive #FakeNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur Sounds like you're mad at them for practicing their constitutional rights. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur Trump's daughter is a Jew. How can they support him? #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur Them being hateful or you disagreeing with their beliefs &amp; views is irrelevant. They have the right to protest. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dems &amp; the Left are responsible for creating &amp; embracing the identity politics these Alt-Righters are adopting #tytlive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kikarasu The point is he said it but it still wasn't good enough smh. I don't even support Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cthagod @THATSHITmcCRAY So if you can call a certain group of Whites crackas, can Whites do the same to Blacks?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur So he might as well not even called them by name since it still doesn't please you. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur Nazi's &amp; White Nationalist have just as much freedom as speech as you. You don't have to agree with them. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur This is why people can't TYT seriously. Leftist propaganda at its finest. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur So by him saying both sides share guilt, that means he supports one side? #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Acts17 Yeah, the demon of denial.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur There is hatred &amp; bigotry on both sides. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cthagod @MadDapr It's a privelege to be an American Citizen. Regardless of race.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur Thats exactly what the 2nd Amend. is for. To fight back against a tyrannical gov. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CommonCenser @NomikiKonst Oh great, more news that the media can sensationalize. #Charolettesville<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur @YouTube How about you start debating a person ideas instead of attacking their character? #Stop #IdentityPolitics #Left<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johniadarola The Left &amp; Dems are responsible for creating &amp; embracing the identity politics these Alt-Right followers are engaging in. #Charolettesville<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tedderukan There's no complexity in the biology of men and women. Women have and nurture children. Men don't. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedderukan In the 1950s Men &amp; Women understood there are two different genders. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedderukan No, they vote candidates in that don't support a Socialist Left Wing insane society, has nothing to do with the end of the world. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur The Quran tells MUSLIMS to take over the world thru conquest. That's the difference. 2/2  #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur The Bible says Jesus will return with his Angels and destroy all the evildoers on Earth NOT his disciples. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur Bias for Islam is insane. Nowhere in the Bible does it says Christians are to kill 7 billion ppl. It says JESUS will. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanZephyr1 From the 1950s and down STD's and Un-Wed child birth were practically non-existent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanZephyr1 Abstinence has worked all throughout America history... What are you talking about?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamsock @Enlighten_Ment_ @JustRaiHere So I can't watch a show and give my opinion because I disagree with their political views? #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VirgenFJ Are you kidding me? The whole ideology of the Left is based on victim hood. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur "Utter frauds" name calling, name calling.. is that all the arguments the left can compose? #tytlive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnaKasparian That's like saying because you don't call the cops if you get robbed means no one should call the police. #tytlive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok @AnaKasparian and if that happen to you, you would have the right to take legal action. #tytlive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No Leftist want vilify anyone that disagrees with them instead of having an honest discussion. That's the difference. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaninKosol How is waging war on a Country legal or illegal?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnaKasparian There are 2 types of people. Ones that are humble or the ones that are going to be humbled. @TheYoungTurks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JessicasBridal2 Block me all you want snowflake. Live in your delusion like a man who thinks he's a woman.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JessicasBridal2 I do watch them and have been for years... But I realized they are extremely biased &amp; are not independent news org.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DineshDSouza @mmfa The Left doesn't like to debate. They just like to be right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neiltyson Why not debate a scientist that has arrived to a different conclusion instead of tweeting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neiltyson First of all no one is debating climate change. The debate is the effect humans have on it. Why not debate another scientist?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JessicasBridal2 It's not about liking them. It's about exposing lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JessicasBridal2 How do you know that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustRaiHere @cenkuygur Anyhow conforming doesn't require agreement. By following the law, they conform to it. Therefore, they conform to gay marriage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Comm_queen15 @cenkuygur Following the law is conforming.. Which is my point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@retorikku Because she married a US citizen...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rahnaseeta The first 5 books of the Bible is the Jewish Torah.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Comm_queen15 @cenkuygur Conforming does not require agreement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Comm_queen15 @cenkuygur But they conformed to the ruling, did they not?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustRaiHere @cenkuygur Nonetheless modern Christianity is far from the Bible which means they have done a lot of conforming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jews are the only ones who follow the OT #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How can Christians be responsible for the Holocaust and stopping it at the same time? #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur How can you honestly say evangelicals haven't conformed to liberal ideals? Gay marriage is legal. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anytime data surfaces that support their agenda it's presented but any data that counters it isn't disclosed. How is that honest? #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Muslim countries are more accepting than the US. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CptJinglePants @cenkuygur Nonetheless that still says that we should be excited when Women are better than Men.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CptJinglePants @cenkuygur It's a fact that he just celebrated the article that pertained women to be better coders than men but yesterday did the opposite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CptJinglePants @cenkuygur But because it favored women, he celebrated the story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CptJinglePants @cenkuygur If there was more info that further supported the story yesterday I doubt Cenk would've celebrated it in the same way or even reported it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CptJinglePants @cenkuygur It's not opinion, it's fact. They just did it and yes they do have the power to persuade their viewers to think a certain way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CptJinglePants @cenkuygur Yesterday when the story seem to state men were better Cenk looked down on the story but since it turned out to be opposite, it's celebrated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CptJinglePants @cenkuygur It's not about the jobs. It's about the celebration of women being better than men.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AaronKenawell92 @AnaKasparian @kimscorcher @HannahCranston Different? Hardly...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CptJinglePants @cenkuygur Seem more like a celebration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blakeleymusic @AnaKasparian is going to hear it later.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoldenTalon Women that want to take care of their husband and children are often looked down upon by the left...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CptJinglePants @cenkuygur That's not the point... So if info in other industries regard men superior should it be celebrated?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So basically if women are better than men it should be celebrated but if men are better than women it should be hidden.. Sexist? #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DorisFillion Wow... So it's ok to say women are better than men and that isn't sexist?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zach_Wilde79 Men suck?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So new that presents Women better than Men = Good, the opposite bad. Honestly do you not see the hypocrisy? @cenkuygur #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DineshDSouza The tolerant left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hasanthehun So you have more sympathy for them then your own citizens? Where's your sympathy for the right that you believe is brainwashed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JessicasBridal2 Ain't nothing like blind faith...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TofighKarimi @cenkuygur 2 million funded by "the people" vs 20 million by big hedge funds. Hm, I wonder who has the bigger voice.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheYoungTurks @Politicon @cenkuygur @AnaKasparian @hasanthehun Why not poll who won?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This whole idea that if you're in the opposite party you're inherently evil needs to stop.  #TYTLive<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Darius89x it's pointless b/c you're a liar. The point of immigration laws is to deter ppl from illegally immigrating.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Darius89x So if most ppl are still committing crimes then what's the point of having traffic laws?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x You said tickets don't deter ppl from committing traffic violations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x Yes I know you switched your argument. Like I said other sensible solutions can be discussed but just letting them stay isn't one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x So there's absolute no point of traffic laws. Do you hear yourself? This is why ppl don't take ppl like you seriously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x @TomiLahren We won't see eye to eye b/c you're in obvious denial. ‚úåüèΩ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Darius89x @TomiLahren Do you think you'd speed more, less, or about the same if it wasn't for tickets?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x @TomiLahren I understand what you're saying but you're clearly wrong. I'm not missing anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x @TomiLahren Now is there another alternative that could be discussed. Yes but just letting them stay isn't one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x @TomiLahren If you're caught coming or being here illegally getting deported is the most sensible option.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x Your first option was to just let them stay then you said let them do community service which is a little more sensible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x @TomiLahren So tickets don't deter you from committing traffic violations?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x @TomiLahren What does Politicians being against something have to do with me not being against something?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x @TomiLahren But you're sitting here trying to discuss another sensible option. The point is just letting them stay isn't one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x @TomiLahren Citizenship cost 20k. The fine should be more than that. The point is to deter ppl for committing the crime.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x @TomiLahren What does that mean to me?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x @TomiLahren The punishment has to fit the crime.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x @TomiLahren That money would be going to the government &amp; I'd argue for something like 50k and they should still have to pay tax<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x @TomiLahren But they still broke the law to get here. What should the consequences for that be?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x @TomiLahren How is it wrong to buy citizenship?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x @TomiLahren So they get a pass for breaking the law?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x @TomiLahren then they can begin the process of become a citizen b/c they paid their debt for the crime they committed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x @TomiLahren Yes they can become tax paying citizens but then what would be the point of having a border?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x @TomiLahren It would only be unfair if they weren't paying for the extra service.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x @TomiLahren But they're paying for it is what I'm saying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x @TomiLahren Yes I'm for spending money to reinforce sensible laws. Laws that support the sovereignty of the Country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x @TomiLahren I'm saying I would be for letting them pay a fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x @TomiLahren I have my mind set on the more logical choice. If it were more logical to keep them I would be for it. But it's not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x @TomiLahren How is it unfair if they're paying for it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x @TomiLahren I'm cool with spending money to reinforce laws that are vital to the Country. Like having a border.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x @TomiLahren So then the fine should be hire if they come illegally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x @TomiLahren That'll be the whole point of paying $500,000.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x @TomiLahren Citizenship is like a club membership. Nothing is unfair if ppl pay more money to skip or speed up the process.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x @TomiLahren Yes but it reinforces the message that ppl cannot come here illegally. If not for that, why even have borders?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x @TomiLahren If it illegals would be fined $15-20,000 to stay. That'll be cool too for the most part.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x @TomiLahren Oh ok. What's wrong with that? They're giving the Country extra money to speed up the legal process.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x @TomiLahren The point isn't to help them pay taxes. It's to reinforce the law. Allowing them to stay sends a negative message.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x @TomiLahren I'm focused on the main problem. Just because something might be cheaper doesn't make it an overall better solution.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x @TomiLahren Read your question. Are you saying some illegals pay 500k to gain citizenship &amp; do I have problem with that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x @TomiLahren So they broke the law and she be rewarded with a path to citizenship?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x @TomiLahren huh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mr_Jordan03 @TomiLahren Yes the proof is the rhetoric you're repeating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mr_Jordan03 @TomiLahren I didn't say you yourself was a Leftist. I said you're being brainwashed by them &amp; the mainstream media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mr_Jordan03 @TomiLahren None. Black ppl need to wake up and stop being brainwashed by the Left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mr_Jordan03 @TomiLahren Name one Country in the world that doesn't have these things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x @TomiLahren How is it fair to the people who went thru the legal process if the US gives citizenships to illegals?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darius89x @TomiLahren People shouldn't illegally enter the Country and expect to become Citizens. No other Country does this. Not even Mex<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mr_Jordan03 @TomiLahren It's backwards for a Sovereign Nation to have borders &amp; citizens?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeSuSFrEaK6_14 @dimebagmetott @cenkuygur "Young" is after "Yes." When doing alphabetical order, you don't include "The."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KyleKulinski So you wouldn't take 400k for a speech?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KENNYKJJ @blackwomencare @TomiLahren Yes both share blame.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ajplus People who wanted to discriminate tried to use the Bible to support their argument but failed since the Bible doesn't support it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ajplus Christianity &amp; Capitalism is responsible for making America the greatest nation in the world. Not Secularism &amp; Socialism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cassie_Jaye @YouTube And yet a lot of Left Wing outlets won't even mention it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marvinw_marvin @People4Bernie It's not your business to be convincing Americans of anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cthagod It's Spring. This is Spring weather.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur So half the Country was right and the other half was wrong?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EscherSays No, Americans need to start taking some self responsibility for their own health.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2Stroong The government shouldn't be forced to provide that either. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have the right to have healthcare like we have the right to own a gun but that doesn't mean the government must provide it. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The problem in America isn't the lack of healthcare. It's the lack of Americans taking care of their own health. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mikecarb @KyleKulinski @YouTube Point being?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KyleKulinski @YouTube The Left has become so brainwashed that they think it makes them more of a man to put a woman in charge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MusicGuadalupe @TomiLahren But 95% of military deaths are men.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomiLahren You're a Liberal in a conservative outfit. People saw thru it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lindahillmorris @cenkuygur Point is there are fewer health problems you can't avoid than ones you can.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimTouz @NomikiKonst What's the revolution? Communism or Socialism?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KyleKulinski Move.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lindahillmorris @cenkuygur And focus our money on researching the things we can't. How bout dah.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lindahillmorris @cenkuygur Qhat if Americans took better care of themselves so we avoid wasting money on the things we can control.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lindahillmorris @cenkuygur Yeah because Breast Cancer is the only health problem Americans face but calling me names wins the argument.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hasanthehun The solution to our problems isn't to get someone else to pay for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hasanthehun Healthcare is a right just like owning a firearm. However, that doesn't mean the government must provide it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hasanthehun The problem isn't lack of healthcare. It's the lack of Americans taking care of their health.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KyleKulinski What's the point of having a bunch of ppl discuss and agree on essentially everything?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NomikiKonst We have the right to healthcare like the right to own a gun. However, that doesn't mean the government must provide it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NomikiKonst The solution isn't to keep getting other ppl to pay for stuff you need or want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NomikiKonst The problem isn't lack of healthcare. It's the lack of Americans taking care of their health.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ajplus Yes, let's be the only species to act like different sexes or the role they play don't exist. #Insanity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KyleKulinski The most positive outcome that come about is the independency from government.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sweetbabyruski @awesomelykate @DineshDSouza How can a male nurture a baby?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sweetbabyruski @awesomelykate @DineshDSouza So if I say women birth and nurture babies is that because of gender or sex?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sweetbabyruski @awesomelykate @DineshDSouza and What is gender?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sweetbabyruski @awesomelykate @DineshDSouza I've researched it and it doesn't make any sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sweetbabyruski @TheYoungTurks @NerdAlertTYT @kimscorcher Means the argument of climate change is still open for discussion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sweetbabyruski  @NerdAlertTYT @kimscorcher The fact that 3% of Scientist can do systematic studies &amp; come to a diff conclusion...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheYoungTurks @NerdAlertTYT @kimscorcher Science isn't a consensus. Just because 97% agree doesn't prove anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@freedomcstan No it does not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justicedems @ShaunKing Yes, the American public has become weird.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KitDaniels1776 @RealAlexJones @DRUDGE So where's the outcry for male genital mutilation aka circumcision?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrumpyDoc77 @DineshDSouza No.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@awesomelykate @DineshDSouza So we can't prove there are only 2 different genders?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DuJuan_Daniels @DineshDSouza So gender is a social construct?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JennaLore @dat570zx @Disney @neiltyson therefore, you're argument is invalid.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JennaLore @dat570zx @Disney @neiltyson We can only go off the stats we have. Not on the assumptions of the info we don't. Checkmate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JennaLore @dat570zx @neiltyson @Disney Therefore, you lack intellect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JennaLore @dat570zx @neiltyson @Disney Is a whole other argument. Also, there's no way to tell if ppl were in the closet or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JennaLore @dat570zx @neiltyson @Disney Ok but the argument is using the stats from those times. Whether they represent them accurate or not<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ajplus Now he's going to be around a whole bunch Black inmates and COs in Rikers Island..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tweetserguy They were Liberals and Socialists. This is a fact. Nazi = National Socialists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tweetserguy @DineshDSouza So that's why all the founders of original fascism were leftist?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So you can investigate a US citizen without disclosing any evidence on why you're investigating said person? #ComeyHearing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@strangenothings @ShaunKing @FBI @realDonaldTrump Then obviously the Trump admin should face the consequences, but again what if it doesn't?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johniadarola So they could investigate a citizen without them knowing what evidence they have on why they're investigating said citizen?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jrgoob Discrimination is very minimal in 2017 America. The problem is this form of entitlement the Left seems to have.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jrgoob Yes but men who want to be a CEO of a company don't complain about discrimination. They start their own companies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If women want more women CEOs they should become more entrepreneurial. Not demand to be a CEO because they're a woman. #TYTLive<|endoftext|>
