<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Working together consists of not imposing a federal mask mandate that would adversely affect thw quality of life of the mask exempt. #stopmullying #cancellockdowns<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChadeighL @realannapaulina Freedom and equality are the principle things.  In this land of the free, all should be able to support their candidate of choice without political affiliation discrimination.  I certainly do not condone any bullying, harrassment, hate crimes, etc., against women or anyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump Yes.  As a black Republican supportive of Donald Trump, I have endured theft of my MAGA hat, death threats/attempts, poll intimidation, true voter suppression, you name it..We deserve answers for these compromised ballots. #thedeadcantvote #trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realannapaulina I can't believe the media is irresponsibly reporting Biden as presidential winner with the numerous cases of mass voter fraud in place. It's not over at all.  #legalvotesonly #trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's easy to be calm about an election when you know you have orchestrated enough voter fraud to ensure your election to office. #thedeadcantvote #checkthemail #massvoterfraud #trumpsupporter<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealOmarNavarro I can tell you how. Voter distraction to commit voter fraud. I was informed that NV would do this ballot tampering.  Corruption evident when on with mayor's office in September 2020. #thedeadcantvote #checkthemail #clarkecountyquestionmarks<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realannapaulina Truth: NV foreplanned to manipulate the ballots I was informed.  When on with mayor's office in September 2020, the undertone of corruption was evident.  A corrupt mayor produces corrupt flock. #clarkecountyvoterfraud #thedeadcantvote #real<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realannapaulina NV Voter Fraud is real. Some individuals in NV knew how visible I was for Trump at his rallies in '19, and informed me in September 2020 NV would do this.  I couldn't really fathom it until seeing it happening now. Believe it.  #checkthemail #checktheids #can'twakethedead<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realannapaulina Loved this! The POTUS was poised, impactful, factual, then 'dropped the mic' by walking about without taking questions. #trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump .Loved the conference-how the President made his impactful statement, then 'dropped the mic' by walking out with no questions accepted.  President Trump has the right to ALL of his legal votes and to transparency and equality in the ballot-counting process.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SWAtlasHoover Yes lockdowns kill, and masks aren't necessarily efficacious.  Too many mask-wearing, hand-sanitizing persons are catching COVID..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity The "Bully Fest" masked as a town hall led by Savannah Guthrie was outrageous!  I was proud to see our president stand firm, fact check on COVID and other issues, and illuminate contributions to Americans of Color. #TEAMTRUMP  #blackrepub<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I enjoyed how you stood your ground in the Town Hall aka "Bully Fest" led by Savannah Guthrie.  The questions asked and manner in which asked were truly vicious in comparison to those in the Biden Town Hall. #teamtrump #blackrepublican<|endoftext|>
