<|startoftext|>@Lowes No dissatisfaction ever mentioned or implied. Just based on the formula and what each product is. Buying a 2020 over the 2019 is a better deal. A dollar in my pocket, is better than your pocket.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lowes Understand, but I get a better deal on a 2020 not in sale with duscount than a 2019 model on clearance with no mil discount. I appreciate the the discount, avg about $500 a week in store and in line purchases<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lowes if your selling a 2019 model, says it is on clearance, but price only dropped $200, then why can't I still use my military discount? It was in sale for the same price last year, because I almost bought it. Ariens X 52 zero turn. If it was in sale I could get the extra 10%<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Lowes Please explain, how it was in stock Wednesday, Thursday get email stating delivery today and at 0705 this morning I am told, it's not in stock, special order which can take 2 weeks. Then get an email for delivery 10 Nov, a Sunday. I took they day off for delivery.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tell your CEO he needs to leave the stores alone, doesn't need to be another Home Depot. Stop shopping there 16 years ago, when I built my house. No Service. Also he needs to cough up more money for employees. Midland is high cost living.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Walgreens Well a big shout out to Brandon at the 4313 Andrews Hwy Midland, Texas and the Pharmacist.

<|startoftext|>@Walgreens then store has to verify they have it. Come on, what a waste of my time. Now just told they don't have it in stock. I'll make I complain to Tri Care about your contract.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Walgreens EPic fail!!! Drop off script at 7pm, told one hr, 15hrs later in line, get call on hold. Store out of stock. So, instead of locating other stores, I have to wait for another call, pickup script, drive to other store, get surpassed by drive up while in store.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Well, that's for God to decide.
