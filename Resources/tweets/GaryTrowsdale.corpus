<|startoftext|>@AnnaSmee1 @UKScouting @Girlguiding @UKYouth @natyouthagency @PrincesTrust Good a time as any for vital deconstruct and reconstruction needed.

<|startoftext|>@DirectorVRU With hindsight we should never have asked “Jim to fix it” but on a reliability factor probably Boris even less so!! But .. Yes WE can.

<|startoftext|>@paulgerrard1971 @MarcusRashford I hope Marcus understands the significance of this as a societal game changer way beyond free school meals.

<|startoftext|>The Cygnus report 2016 proves that the Government had plenty of warning a pandemic was coming but failed to prepare. The reason is Brexit.

<|startoftext|>1% of the London population holds 90% of its wealth. Until society deals with wealth disparity it’s futile. And these people occupying Government don’t give their own money away<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SheldonThomas3 Hence @MarcusRashford intervention so important and it’d be good to educate those in ivory towers that poverty and inequality is the man made environment the problems emanate from. “County lines” and associated labelling lets huge chunk society see it as not their problem<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nickyjanehill @Whitney_Iles Laziness .. Slack attitude .. gutted @YouthViolenceUK didn’t have evidence session on funders .. the millions now going on funding “industry” is pathetic ... meanwhile politicians give the crab barrel a little prod from time to time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickyjanehill @Whitney_Iles Personally think that asking youth advisor boards to do videos explaining why project should be funded etc when chances of smaller grass roots orgs getting the money is long shot.. abysmal abuse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smpbrixton Sure there’ll be a “plan” to deal with it. Somewhere in a Versace clad filing cabinet 😬<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SteveChalke @Oasis_UK @YouthViolenceUK But @OYSupport can’t do this on their own.

<|startoftext|>@SteveChalke @Oasis_UK Why does @YouthViolenceUK sound like a bad Channel 5 documentary? Because this kind of labelling is all the establishment has understood for too long.

<|startoftext|>@earlyyearscop @Sergeant280 Jack the mistrust issue is an issue. Today’s guardian print edition is tomorrow’s chip paper but the mistrust issue will sadly still be the mistrust issue. Too many BAME families living in poverty. Poor communities over policed. There you go. Nailed it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdDavie Whatever.... you’ll be telling us Jacks not Katie’s brother next!! 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimDicksLambeth Ruud Gullit @ChelseaFC ✅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@network_police @Departie86 @policecommander @YouthViolenceUK And far too many young Black people coming from families caught in poverty trap. The narrative is so important. It’s the over policing of poor communities that’s the issue. When this is reality checked the conversation becomes more solution focused as happened in Scotland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chelseacazza @Kingcanners cancel the supper invite!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣 #InTheSoup<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Graham_Goulden @policecommander The trust deficit is almost as wide as the wealth gap in London now and with a populist little Englander Government imposing atrocity after atrocity policing needs be smarter not regressive.

<|startoftext|>@Departie86 @policecommander @YouthViolenceUK Think we’ve got Best Police in the world. Racial profiling due the policing of poor communities where too many BAME families are caught in poverty trap. There’s the issue right there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Departie86 @policecommander @YouthViolenceUK John knows the evidence we compiled with @YouthViolenceUK talked much about mistrust being a problem.. As such I personally feel violated by the “Ramped up” S&amp;S data during lockdown. Word I’d use? Vicious!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Departie86 @policecommander @YouthViolenceUK And the stop &amp; search disparity is exactly what it is not even a current Government minister could dispute the disproportionate realities of being young and black with S&amp;S .. So many kids carry knives out of fear but won’t speak to police...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Departie86 @policecommander @YouthViolenceUK The absolute state of Policing in America while our Government courts the Trump regime for trade deals etc .. Nothing to do with Policing in UK? Nope but all heightening tensions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Departie86 @policecommander @YouthViolenceUK The xenophobic nature of EU referendum and Dip stick media owners giving platforms to Farage etc all heightened tensions. The KKK installing president of free world not helped. Nothing to do with policing? No but everything to do with injustice as did Covid disparity ... TBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@policecommander Wow... Seriously John???? You do realise how badly the black community are feeling right about now right!!!! Racial profiling sucks. Until it’s addressed the trust deficit will get worse and worse and more lives will be lost of kids who trust knives more than police<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AaronTheClarke @earlyyearscop @YouthViolenceUK @policecommander Sadly there is a very close relationship between white privilege &amp; institutional racism and not being black we will never fully understand.

<|startoftext|>@AaronTheClarke @earlyyearscop @YouthViolenceUK @policecommander Aaron that’d be great and there is work on going currently which @YouthViolenceUK helped facilitate.

<|startoftext|>@ExLambethIAG @chris_greany The mistrust issue is a major component in this toxic problem. Has been for a long time. Politicians and senior police know it.

The stats don’t lie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@earlyyearscop @AaronTheClarke One of the enduring highlights of 4 years evidence based work with @YouthViolenceUK was of @policecommander thanking everyone in his session on public health approach for not once having mentioned stop &amp; search.

<|startoftext|>@roysmithpolice True. There is a very important dialogue needed. Communication has always been a clumsy issue.

<|startoftext|>@nickdebois @SadiqKhan @talkRADIO @BorisJohnson Seems you do as well. Your not fit to sit on a media platform when your just a one trick pony propagandist.

<|startoftext|>@nickdebois @SadiqKhan @talkRADIO Stats are bull shit. Cuts to youth services &amp; social care plus the disgusting reality of inequality exposed with Covid.

<|startoftext|>@nickdebois @SadiqKhan @talkRADIO Probably because your disgraceful political Tory showboating on a radio platform doesn’t suggest a fair hearing.

All the evidence suggests they don’t. Learnings of Covid that they don’t even care. The language they use to describe criminalisation of the poorest doesn’t display even the slightest empathy. You could say this Government is a public health risk 🛑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To add insult to injury yesterday I saw the new shirt up close @Kingcanners @smpbrixton @omid9 it ain’t black it’s navy blue. You know that shade of blue the mob over the other side of town play in. Someone at Nike clearly don’t know a thing about Chelsea! #itsachelseathing  https://t.co/ri8SrfqN1z<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope you ladies connect at some stage @katesilverton @RiaChatter different news channels same passion for change 👍🏻 it’s a tough issue to become embroiled in even from journalism perspective.

<|startoftext|>Not looking like be getting much rest this weekend. Story of 4 years. Thoughts. Reflections. The mess it was in. Starting again from scratch.

<|startoftext|>Fantastic Zoom chat my friend @HaqueAbs it was great to report plans back to @TaylorOBE straight after as you’ll see!! @DTTlondon 20th anniversary legacy campaign is delighted to have @metpoliceuk as a partner! PS: Tell Rebecca she’s on Twitter now 😉 #Hope2020  https://t.co/ZW3uvDIhHQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fair point ... #DuckWits 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rufio_G @ConstableXL @metpoliceuk @D_Tribal @sholmeslewis Your engaging one of London’s top community engaged cops here. Just for perspective. Twitter isn’t the best forum. Be great if you connected with @sholmeslewis as @ConstableXL suggests. If your following Shay ain’t exactly shy calling for change. Be part of the solution ✅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lucyOSD20 @OrgCic @HaqueAbs Well done Lucy and Abs .. Be good if pan London cohesive training programme developed in partnership I reckon @sholmeslewis @voyageyouth @D_Tribal @Jerome_H_Agyei @mentivity #JoinUpTheDots<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sunday 16th August @LeeJWhitehead 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This may be of interest @SergiouTheo .. I’m thinking @RiaChatter be interested in your campaign as well .. The administrational ARMY of huge wage earners in London is incredible #DontZapTheZip<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nadine_Writes And she knows her latest successor in Home Office has her fingerprints all over the “ramping up” of stop &amp; search during pandemic. PPE and supporting care homes not so much but policing poor communities.. Boom 💥 Patel puts the hostile in #HostileEnvironment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is not normal. It was never normal. Fact it became everyday news still doesn’t make it normal. Debating Stop &amp; search is legitimate in my view as mistrust doesn’t help stop this shit @TakeBackTPower @athianakec_myp @RachelO_Ojo @lbilli91 #TheFinalWord<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sports clubs the World over. Not black v white but everyone v racists... that right there.. that was the moment #BlackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@andygeorgeni @GeordieDetectiv Absolutely get that. Personally think we’re a lot closer to having best police in the World than the worst .. This refusal to acknowledge a problem when whole world can see Priti Patel fingerprints all over the “ramped up” stop &amp; search during lockdown just sad though ☹️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fascinatorfun They have skin in the game with the polling companies of course. Nothing is as it seems anymore. Nothing. Apart from things like the turn out for BLM marches etc - Truth to power<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NeilSpyBarnett Come on then Spy who you calling it on? I’m hearing Frank wants to bring Declan Rice back as he’s a leader and very vocal. Mmm now where did that JT kid start out? #TradingPlaces<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoivanWade Great look Jove your turning into @DeeKaate 🤣🤣 #CyborgOnTheWall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jawsfan508 @policecommander Actually it was Johns tweet. Not so much a police tweet he’s a successful author you know 😉 He’s also got a rather clever Spaniel 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andygeorgeni @OneBigCommunity Well said Andy!!! Needs saying loudly sadly it’s appalling to find many police officers taking criticism like they are having it harder than the black community stop &amp; searches day in day out for no other reason than being black!!! @LeroyLogan999 @SiobhanBenita 🛑 #Enough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jawsfan508 @policecommander It’s not anti police rhetoric it’s cold hard facts. You don’t have to follow the evidence as much as trip over it day in day out on London’s streets. Don’t remember inviting you for a chat about it anyway. Bye 👋🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SiobhanBenita So that’s where @LeroyLogan999 curtains went!! 🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jawsfan508 @policecommander Yes indeed. Tell them that when their being stop &amp; searched for the 10th time when completely innocent just to stay calm and be polite. If with girlfriends feeling humiliated try to curb temptation to hit out!!!!!! #RacialProfiling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Britain has a class problem. Always has had probably always will have. The problem with people who’ve been born into or purchased their way into privilege is when your heads up your arse you can’t see the wart on the end of your nose #Class<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kinda nails it!!! #TheBullingdonClub<|endoftext|>

Authenticated knowledge. Without your intervention in 2009 this project might never have happened. Without Mr Umunna absorbing your intel after he got his bum whooped here on Twitter a week earlier the debate may not have been won 😉 #ThisGirlCan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So now we’ve got a senior @MPFed officer talking about “out of control drugs markets” “youth violence” and “lack of job opportunities” to justify racial profiling of black parents with 3 month old baby in their car. Bonkers!!! @mentivity @GMB Great work @sholmeslewis #Enough  https://t.co/w2B7VCfSke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Priti Patel is the only Cabinet Minister to have actually “ramped” anything up during this whole shambolic pandemic shit show by the Government. She ramped up stop &amp; search in poorest communities and same communities hit hardest by Covid got the brunt of it!! #HostileEnvironment  https://t.co/ViYAVe5cDe<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@crimlawuk @YouthViolenceUK @KeirIrwinRogers @lbilli91 Feeling we’ve got one of the best police forces in the World but this issue is the great big fat elephant in the room. More so now after stark Covid19 revelations. The pile in by ex cops here on Twitter doesn’t help especially when many accounts show them as also pro Brexit 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crimlawuk Such a depressing state of affairs for those who simply want to see young people kept safe. The mistrust issue been a thorn in the side of progress trying to deal with @YouthViolenceUK issues for ridiculous long time @KeirIrwinRogers @lbilli91 #GroundhogDay<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AnnaSmee1 Be great to have a chat as to how that happens in practical terms fairly and justly. The @DTTlondon run programmes with @2020ChangeUk which access the most disadvantaged.

<|startoftext|>@MistaGoode @AJTHECOACH @premierleague @SkySports @Nike Yes Winston. Calling out unfairness can be habitual. You should try it sometime. Oh sorry you do.. When you think it suits you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AJTHECOACH @premierleague @SkySports @Nike Devils advocate. We’ve all been force fed a false reality for far too long. Did you know the big brands buy up advertising billboards in poor communities before affluent ones? Sometimes a background in marketing is a mental health challenge. Then there’s the bankers 🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear @premierleague footballers. Your not playing football. Your job is playing football. In case your unaware the money you’ve been given by and large comes from poor people buying @SkySports subscriptions and @Nike gear. Just thinking out loud! #NewWorldOrderNeeded<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the problems people born into privilege have is under development of the brain cells where empathy and compassion evolve from.

<|startoftext|>@paulgerrard1971 @UKChange Fully agree Paul and your store staff just doing what they do day in day out deserve medals as well. Coming out of this elitism needs dismantling and human beings need to take back control of the planet 😉 #GroundControlToCaptainTom<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GaryLineker Talk of oil rich football takeovers and I’m recalling Freddie Fletcher flying around with BP on the firm @bphillpotts 😎<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RaphFrascogna @TfL @MattHancock @DrRosena @NHSuk It’s clearly very strategic. They called it herd immunity at outset then backtracked when realised many thousands were gonna die and needed cover their tracks. Cue Boris and Matt catching it and Cummings doing a runner. Brexit? They couldn’t organise a school disco #GetCovidDone<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sherrylynnpeck CC: @katesilverton Very good point. Equally Interesting parallel 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiomaYouthwork The same idiotic bigoted and racist thinking that triggered Brexit. Lest people forget the Brexit campaign was funded by the same far right ideologists that funded trump.
