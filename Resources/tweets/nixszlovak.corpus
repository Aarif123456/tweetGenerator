<|startoftext|>@nextofficial I returned it on the 2nd Jan, with receipt, in original condition with tags attached and the Lincoln branch would not refund my credit card. Gave me Gift Card instead which is what I'm upset about and why I got in touch in the first place! Purchased on 25 Oct as Xmas gift.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Neighbour has a new girlfriend. She has a penchant for suddenly re-enacting famous scenes from movies, with gusto, in the wee small hours of the morning. It’s clear that “When Harry Met Sally” is her favourite. Wish she’d pick another film. Preferably “The Artist”.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ask a Saffa what car they drive &amp; answer you get will probably be like, "A black VW Golf GTI 2 litre Limited Edition with sunroof, red leather trim &amp; 17in alloys".

<|startoftext|>Looking forward to @clareteal's intercontinental natter with #LaurieHollowayMBE on her @BBCRadio2 show tonight. Here they are back in 2011!  https://t.co/gP3LyZAP9E<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>When you spot a hunk and then he whips out a ciggie &amp; lights up and suddenly it's like he's morphed into Voldemort. Or Golum. Or The Donald.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So glad @Foxtel saved #APlaceToCallHome. S4 a corker! Thrilled S5 coming but a year is a long time to wait for the Blighs to get to Blighty!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's it... Labelling this bra "D". It's not wishful thinking - the D is for "Detestable".  With a capital D.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just love #APlaceToCallHome on @BBCTwo. It's like a comfy pair of slippers. Warm and fuzzies guaranteed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clareteal PS "lala" means to sleep in Zulu, hence 'lala land' ref - a common phrase in South Africa! Oh, and prefer your Speak Low btw 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clareteal Hello *waves*. Contemplated watching #Oscars but will no doubt be in #lalaland before shenanigans get underway in the wee hours.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Overheard on bus: "Hello? Hello? I'm going to message you with my message!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @clareteal swings into @cadoganhall on 16 Feb to celebrate Lady Ella's 100th - with Benny Onions @BenCipolla for a dash of extra flavour!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Been fantasizing about Belgian Biscuit Curls dunked in coffee all afternoon. And you know what folks? Dreams really do come true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lycra clad bloke at shop had bod shaped like a superhero. Odd swagger tho. Dunno if twas to accentuate physique or if he just had jock itch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New £1 LED spotlights considerably brighter than old halogen jobs, but the bargain may be offset by the need to purchase a white cane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What happened to the biscuits I bought you ask? Well I'm afraid they had a bit of an accident. They fell down my throat. A tragic business.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Overheard in shop... Teenage Daughter 1: "Look how sick this is!" Mom: "Do we have to use that word?" Teenage Daughter 2: "What?! Vagina?"<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>.@clareteal Made 2nd ever vinyl purchase today. Great tracks, but can't say I'm familiar with the Ella/ Louis classic "I'll Wind"! 😁 #typo  https://t.co/vE4cWWd2ce<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Charged 'round bed, forgetting I'd left base storage drawer open. Clobbered shin a shot. Excruciating. May have uttered a swear word. Or two<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know what's grim? When u wait an age for a bus and when it arrives, it smells like a fishmonger's street stall on a tropical summers day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ran out of foil this a.m. so had to use baking paper to wrap my sarnie. Now it's lunchtime circa 1984 all over again. Sarnie swop anyone?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dude! U looked so cool popping a wheelie on ur scooter. When ur L plate scraped road - so rad! Speed-wobble to finish, A-MA-ZING! #plonker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanSpencer56 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanSpencer56 Ja... I'm leaning that way too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanSpencer56 Charge 2 is the new must have Fitbit. Nice special edition straps in the range #girly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanSpencer56 Apparently it's slightly bulkier than the Charge 2 but then you don't need phone for the GPS to work!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanSpencer56 I like the idea of GPS without having to tote phone. Only thing is, they reckon it's rather chunky for ladies...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanSpencer56 Any thoughts on the Garmin Vivosmart HR+? I fancy a fitness tracker with GPS... for larks!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Drawing perilously close to end of my 15 mins of fame, but my tune choices feature in tonight's #swingsthething segment on @BBCRadio2. 7pm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My first ever vinyl record purchase just arrived and I can't tell you how excited I feel! All I need now is a decent turntable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the tube again. It's unusually full. Playing a game of "Guess who smells of mothballs". It's not who you'd think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeMikelovatt Ooh - that would be fab... and very kind! Thank you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeMikelovatt Ah, thanks for info. If I can't find it on CD, I'll keep an eye out when rummaging through LPs!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I so hope that this is real!  https://t.co/dBvs4605FE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perhaps the pervasive nature of wifi is doing more harm than good?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well hello there gorgeous! Glad you could make it. Tell your two pals bringing up the rear to pull finger. #roses  https://t.co/Ryy0jNf1r1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusanCalman I have a fringe - do I also get a show? #SheBangs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheHopShop It was utterly delightful! A treat for the senses. Thanks for having us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spent the morning waiting for Thames Water to attend to a sewer issue. Spent the afternoon in the lav @TheHopShop  https://t.co/1XrijVg3aw<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Today's mission, which I have chosen to accept, is to get a stock of lollies home before they self destruct.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisRhydderch Yep, ditto - a class act all the way!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisRhydderch Thanks very much Chris! Clare's @marlboroughjazz gig was, as always, just fab!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Flipping cooking on the South Coast today!  34° in #Worthing. And the ice-cream parlour has run outta snow freeze.  https://t.co/LP2j6oZ7sV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Boppyfi Listening to Sunday's show. Saddened to learn of your Mum's passing. Heartfelt condolences to you and your family x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gargantuan spider in the house. Think it spent childhood holidays in Fukushima.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @BenCipolla - there are a couple more pics of you and @clareteal at #majazz16 here:  https://t.co/aO5EYyrBaR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's local lad @BenCipolla sharing The Priory Stage with @clareteal @marlboroughjazz #AintNoMountainHighEnough  https://t.co/rwjxVdPdR2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In other news, butternut noodles - a.k.a "Boodles" - are an actual thing. Available for purchase from your local @sainsburys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With all these 80s/90s artists giving it another tonk lately, it'd be great to see @WilsonPhillips on the revival bandwagon in the UK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clareteal @marlboroughjazz Ooh ta - thought it was 3pm... glad I checked!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just having a jive at the petrol station... as you do...  https://t.co/HsskGlNmxx #LoveCapeTown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marlboroughjazz What time does Clare Teal's show start on Sunday? Your website doesn't say...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only time you'll catch me "going for a run" is when I'm lying on my side in bed, trying to warm the sheets up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clareteal Chance of sun at @marlboroughjazz on Sunday should be good- afterall, it's in a tent and I heard the sun always shines on teepee.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting my showgirl on. You can always count on Barry Manilow for a good ol' fashioned high-kicking number #CantSmileWithoutYou<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There aren't enough handwritten letters in the world. We should write more letters. And post them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trying to nod but being plagued by a tenacious mozzie. And what's with the violin? Could they not have chosen a less creepy instrument?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clareteal What an interesting interview with @JeffHooperVoice. Fab anecdotes... and that lovely Welsh accent... could listen all night!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Georgie's a formidable force in the field of staring competitions. #LoveMyDog<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Accidentally dowsed kitchen, dog &amp; my hair in peanut oil as I opened a new #Skippy. PNB now drier than the Outback, but our coats are shiny.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@themuddyfield @clareteal @AIRStudios Marvellous! Got a birthday next week - dropping frequent, unsubtle 'turntable' hints :-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Operation "Birthday Surprise" underway. Prezzies: Check.  Cake: Check.  Treats: Check. Me: Czech.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gave #TheTunnel S1 a miss because it was too similar to The Bridge S1, but series 2 is a jolly good watch #Sabotage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clareteal @themuddyfield @AIRStudios C’mon then - don’t keep us in suspenders... How’d it go? Did you make a very nice actual record?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clareteal @AIRStudios Finally! A proper reason to buy a turntable! An almighty challenge alright, but you've got this! #IntoTheGroove<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@themuddyfield @clareteal @BBCRadio2 Enjoyed the show. Coupla numbers in there took me back to my uni days. Could get used to earlier slot!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blimey... first Brexit and the ensuing palaver and now @clareteal on earlier and playing Portishead no less... sure been a funny ol’ week!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This tweet was precision crafted with my Apple Pencil. #snazzy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well the 'new' @DunelmUK on Bromley Rd was a nice surprise. Wish I'd known sooner. Staff lovely too. Chantelle most helpful. Deffo be back!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealLynnBowles iPlayer Radio app is my new favourite toy! Great interview with @clareteal #TwelveOClockTales sounding lush on the wireless!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just realised that the shop only opens at 10:30am. Up way too early. Dumbass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clareteal This @astewartmusic fella's got it going on. Perhaps you could invite him on your show for a cuppa &amp; a natter sometime?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wonder if returning to earth is Peake's trough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jazzmouse @the_halle And rightly so! #TwelveOClockTales oozes quality and class.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🎵🎶🎤 Ay ya ya ya ya cake by the ocean..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd enjoy my Peanut Butter Magnum more if I could get the wrapper off #childproof<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@henriettasimson So floaty! I like x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #ScienceMuseum was great but now I'm thoroughly geeked out and in need of a cuppa and a sit down. And cake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woke up feeling nerdy today. Well, nerdier than usual.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"The Fan Dome is absolutely free, you just have to buy a ticket for a little £2 donation." #Euro2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pudding before dinner. Being a grown up has its perks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Durbs and the Berg looking fab on #TopGear. Racing up treacherous Sani Pass a tad foolhardy though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does the morning sneeze always seem to arrive just as the last of the mascara is going on? #panda<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Avocado Chocolate Pudding"? Ag no sis man! You'd have to be bossies to go for that gemors!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got the bus that's like a lounge at the back. I'm on the 436 to Vauxhall if you fancy popping aboard for a natter.  https://t.co/a1QEwCrVVO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simonlittle @themuddyfield @clareteal Serving #TwelveOClockTales from behind the bar?  https://t.co/gd15isH1C4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clareteal @themuddyfield Checked summer dates. Blimey! Grueling gig schedule! Gonna need a break. A week in Paris would ease the bite of it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rehomed a potbound conifer. Gently massaged the root ball to loosen old soil. Looks happier now. Think she liked having her roots touched up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>M&amp;S - your Chococcino muffins a grave disappointment &amp; a poor start to my long weekend. They tasted like nothing and smelt vaguely of fish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's highlight was discovering where my phone hides e's with doohickeys ontop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seen quite a few chaps working shorts today and there's no doubt about it - that fella was definitely going commando.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry Dude - it's a 19-voetsek Passat. The matt black respray doesn't come with a side of cool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still a novelty seeing telly drama set in Cape Town. #Wallander filled with pukka local references.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The sad looking pruned twigs in the back yard sprouted this whilst I wasn't l looking. Was a marvellous surprise!  https://t.co/kyCbyrRbT0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you sniff curious gunk on the sole of your shoe, it's important not to get any on your lip.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chap on tube had a grand silent chat with himself, complete with exuberant expressions &amp; hand gestures. Dunno topic but was an engaging talk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More I listen to #TwelveOClockTales the more incredulous I become that this exquisite CD was recorded in just 2 days. All hail @the_halle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surround yourself with exquisiteness. Get #TwelveOClockTales from  https://t.co/twfxWT53su. Go on. Do it. Do it now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Oleemorris He ain't nothin' but a hound dog!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheAstorTheatre @LPAC_Lincoln @clareteal Haha! Cake is an excellent start to anything - good work!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @TheAstorTheatre Don't forget to sing Happy B"day to @clareteal tonite. @LPAC_Lincoln got in early last nite but you're the real Deal!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kicking yourself for missing @clareteal @LPAC_Lincoln? You should be. Twas fab. Fear not - she's back with orchestra @palacenewark 29 July!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whoohoo!! T-shirt, shorts, windows down, tunes cranked - it's proper Kylie weather today. Keep up the good work Lincoln!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In retrospect, chompsing two piquanté peppers at once was perhaps not the best idea that I've had today #AyCaramba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clareteal @AlanTheDog Great interview on @SSimplyjazz you two! #TwelveOClockTales<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OK Neighbour... I see your Bowie and raise you one Prince #Cream #GetTheFunkOut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanSpencer56 Pah!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanSpencer56 Where's mine?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hitting the garlic pretty hard today. Apologies in advance to colleagues. And prowling vampires.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yippee! Ironing! Said no-one. Ever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@themuddyfield ...HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR MU-DDY, HA-PPY BIRTH-DAY TOOO YOOUUU!! Hip-hip, HOORAY! (Did ya get the ace weather I ordered for ya?)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ClaudiaWinkle Listening to your Sunday show on catch-up... did the same this time last week. It's great. You're doin' good gal!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing shatters illusions of minor weight loss faster than a freshly laundered pair of jeans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@themuddyfield @clareteal Oh my! It's @BenCipolla! Come a long way since Marlborough '13! Looking forward to show.  https://t.co/6gxb8FGAnh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someone give the Beeb's drama commissioners a medal! #LineOfDuty yet another in a recent batch of top quality shows. Gripping stuff!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a fine line between delicious and burnt to a crisp.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thought I'd bought enough fruit to see me through the week, but I appear to have slipped up in the banana department.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Life's too short to persevere with detestable knickers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Caught with 200g of seed. Charged with intent to distribute (all over the floor). Released under caution.  https://t.co/QZhyxuyKFe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New release #TwelveOClockTales from the divine @clareteal is a revelation! Halle-lujah!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Three generous doubles and a triple going spare, but large lady chooses to sit on me instead. Super. #backofbusblues  https://t.co/TUWiCDUX6b<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel I want to visit Scotland.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Discovered how the birds were getting through the seed so quickly. Houston - we have a squirrel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Canon, Audi, BMW all seem to favour 3, 5 &amp; 7 in product names. Odd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still none the wiser. Just want someone without a vested interest to give it to me straight. #EUreferendum  https://t.co/luxBIQdXmR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Coffee snobs among you will tut, but I really did expect more from Lavazza Premium Instant Intenso. Now know why it was 1/2 price. #poof<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hairdryers: Blowy end good. Sucky end bad. Very, very bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't watch #MasterChef. What those people do with food is unnatural.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love winter attire. It hides a multitude of sins. My birthday suit needs a couple of alterations. Will require a pattern change. Sew be it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Done my back a mischief. Mobility impaired. Bedtime's a treat... can now add "inverted turtle" to my impression repertoire.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clareteal @the_halle Lush list! #TwelveOClockTales<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fab lunch @lovewalkcafe. Glad we booked - place was rammed with Junior Docs on a picket line break. Felt confident during my choking spell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course they do... #JacobandtheGiantImpeachment  https://t.co/B4mk42mezu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would seem I'm a skilled pick up artist. Screws mainly. Though technically, it's not me, it's my tyres. #puncture #downthetubes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beautiful day again. Warm(ish) too. Dare I even consider unpacking the summer wardrobe?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ooh, you know what goes nicely with #CapeVelvet?  Me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Add 'buy a bicycle/ sandals/ anything suede' to that list.  https://t.co/JZyU5Rhmc5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Little pricks all day through. How to shed 'em? Wish I knew.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tried a magnifyer &amp; tweezers  and Duck Tape too  but these wee buggers are stuck like glue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nettles are sneaky.  They're so very mean.  Feel them stuck in my finger,  but they can't be seen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clareteal @eddireader @KomediaBath @themuddyfield Ooh - great venue for it! Seen a coupla gigs there ;-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hung up a new bird feeder opposite my kitchen window 15 mins ago and already have a pair of tits noshing on the fare. I'm beyond tickled!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Karen Carpenter would have been downright miserable today. #RainyDay #Monday #StormKatie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheNightManager was blimmin good. Proper solid telly. Loved every episode. Only moan is that it's finished. I vote @twhiddleston for #Bond.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Happy birthday Uncle Gray. Gone but not forgotten.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCTravelAlert Avoid approaching Oval from any direction. Area gridlocked. Buses on diversion. Traffic crawling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Horrendous traffic around Vauxhall Cross. Hardly moving. Tempers flaring. Vauxhall cross.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCTravelAlert Vauxhall Bridge Rd s'bound at a standstill anything cooking in the area?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remarkable number of folks sporting hats this morning - 33% of all upper deck passengers to be exact. You can tell we're stuck in traffic...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happiness is spending 10 mins at the kitchen window on a sunny Sunday morning watching a robin collect bits for his nearby nest.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Nothing like the boiler deciding on a cuppa tea and a sit down while you're all shampoo'd up mid-shower. Brass monkey would've lost his bits<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Used to think London's "Bell Common Tunnel" was the "Welkom in Tunnel" &amp; thought it odd that it had a Dutch name. Still prefer my version.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She may be fast asleep elsewhere, but no matter how quietly you take cheese from fridge, suddenly Georgie's right behind you. Like ninja dog<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At the rate this showerproof winter coat is leaking feathers &amp; down, it'll be a nice light raincoat come summertime.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@themuddyfield Same rules apply here - even if it means missing the morning tea/ coffee! You can ride with us anytime :-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheNightManager doesn't disappoint. Gripping stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Boppyfi I like your work!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the train. Don't think I've ever seen a Desperate Dan chin in real life 'til now. Fascinating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So when I got up this morning, I never imagined that today I'd have to lick Princess Leia.  https://t.co/k0ziCZ6NM1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is phantom with a p-h but fathom is with an f? Just can't phathom it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Drilling sounds coming from 'neath MI6. No screams though, so all good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New brolly pretty, good size &amp; comfy handle. Only prob is it collapses in rain &amp; I wind up with a pointy brolly hat.  https://t.co/iIVSFH8DKu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blimey. Mr Sharwood was heavy handed with the chillies. This Kung Po is rather Kung Pow!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Revolutionary bus ride. One woman's attempting a Che Guevara beret revival &amp; another looks like @TraceyUllman as the Dictator's Wife.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking forward to @BBCOne's #TheNightManager next Sunday. Stellar cast.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Valentine's Day and I'm looking forward to a special night. Bought myself a new pillow. The fancy Royal Crested kind. Because I'm worth it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was momentarily excited by the lorry emblazoned with "Find &amp; Treat" until I realised that it was a NHS vehicle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clareteal Hoped Walter Wanderly would get a mention in the Hammond feature. He sure knew his organ! Summer Samba been my ringtone 4 yonks!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RyanSpencer56 Thought shedding light on the subject would be useful!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanSpencer56 Crowds expected again. The advice is to check #LumiereLDN for updates. Had to switch some off last nite due to overcrowding!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wow! Thoroughly enjoyed #TheBridge S3. Thanks @BBCFOUR!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They're deeply unsexy and a bit fiddly to get right but I've so enjoyed my thermal long johns today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another day of Bowie tributes. What a drag.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time for a spot of #NordicNoir. Been catching up on saved shows and have finally arrived at #TheBridge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Extortionate car insurance renewal quote from Tesco Bank! Apparently customer loyalty inconsequential, so I'm off. Better deals elsewhere.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm looking forward to my extra 6 seconds of daylight today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@georginajac No, thank you! Great show - thoroughly enjoyed it :-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Catching up with @clareteal's @BBCRadio2 Christmas show @StablesMK. @georginajac's rendition of More left me wanting...um... more. Just fab!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sainsburys Your 5p bags are horrible for groceries. Will have to buy some at Tesco to use in your store. Maybe I'll just do my shop there.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Beautiful day out in Eton. Stopped at The Pineapple for lunch. Managed to get a table under a tree, much to Georgie's delight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Georgie my love, it's very thoughtful of you, but I really don't need my furry foot warmer today.  http://t.co/vggYKhsNJe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>See Janowicz is drinking Gatorade. Wonder where he buys his? I battle to find it in my 'hood.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We've progressed to a trickle of cold. Not enough pressure for hot. Steeling myself with a strong cuppa before taking the plunge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awoke to a curious hooting noise like a distant and partially distressed owl. Noise coming from open basin tap. 2:30 am &amp; still no water.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BenjoEllis Yup, if you want to control both aperture &amp; shutter speed at the same time then M's your mode ;-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenjoEllis If you set S, shutter speed is fixed to what you select (say 1/60th) and cam selects appropriate f no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenjoEllis If you set A, aperture is fixed to what you select &amp; you have to make sure shutter speed stays above 1/50 while shooting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenjoEllis Howzit! For handheld need a shutter speed faster than 1/50 - so 1/60 will do. Achieve by big aperture (1.8) or higher ISO.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>See the refurbished pub is now open. There's a long row of books on the windowsill. Library in a pub? How novel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have to admit, feeling oh so posh with my swish new windows & doors. Double glazed, self locking - bloody marvellous! #ItsTheLittleThings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time for a #GBBO catch-up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Three episodes in & I'm still not quite sure what to make of the totally off-the-wall This Is Jinsy, but it does make me giggle. #Grassworld<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RT @SkyNewsBreak: Jackson's PA: Dr Murray told me MJ had had a "bad reaction" on June 25. &gt; BAD reaction? Murray should've seen that coming.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BryanHabana Well done Bokkie! #rwc2011<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mildly ticked that the rugby isn't being broadcast on telly this morning. Got TV set up in office & was planning to multitask. #rwc2011<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@psvt2 And that he does! Was really good to see the lads together - saw 4 shows without them. Shows were good, but I missed their dynamic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@psvt2 Oh shame - were you Grant-less yesterday? He was doing a bit of a Barry White on Sat nite. Bug must have got the better of him :-(<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Whoop whoop - John Wilson will be touring 'Hooray for Hollywood' in November/ December. I'm there - with bells on!! #proms<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If a black cat crosses your path, two cars in front, does it count?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spinning Ray Conniff and remembering Den. #SWonderful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was being really good no-naughties-wise and then I detoured via the M&S Bakery. #schoolgirlerror #palmiers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Feet are handy. #multitasking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Weird things happening to my household light bulbs. Microwave one died a few days ago & has now sprung to life again. Same with lounge bulb.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenjoEllis @MicheJW 's right - cars should be girls :-) Deffo ain't ugs.  I wish you many miles of safe & happy motoring x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenjoEllis ..or should I say he!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenjoEllis Wow Benny - she's lovely! Look at those mags... and front fogs too - so posh! She looks brand new. You must be tickled :-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenjoEllis  Great time to test the 60/40 split methinks! BTW - waiting for a proper pic of Suarez...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear Mr Green Recycling Collection Dude. I'm not in the habit of putting out empty bins. If you tip it & nothing comes out - look inside!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@impuku Oh bugs... getting my mojo back and keen to get going again :-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@impuku Got any weddings lined up over the next few weeks?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy Spring-bok day everyone!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NannaGudm Lol! At least you can still see! #floppingfringesyndrome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Phew - lots of running in Chase.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fiddes Payne mini marshmallows make me want to burst into song #BandOfGold<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thought I'd do my bit to save the planet. Bought local organic apples. But they suck. Big time. Like 'don't-even-wanna-cook-em' suck. #fail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know, I must confess that generally speaking, I'm not overly thrilled by IKEA's wares.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenjoEllis @MicheJW Excellent - you know how to reach me ;-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Totally forgot about #GBBO tonight. I blame the Bank Holiday. Luv Sky+ tho. #savedbythebox<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenjoEllis @MicheJW  I concur! But this time, try & make it a weekend to make it easier for the working pleb... wld love to see you guys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenjoEllis Ah - you know I woulda, but it's a little far/ late to trek into town now. So need my beauty z's ;-) What you up to down 'ere?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenjoEllis Hello my boy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why that was rather tasty... a Cafe Mocha with a big dollop of clotted cream and a handful of dinky marshmallows. #afterworktreat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StablesMK Spoilt for choice!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bazmint @psvt2 Nite y'all!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bazmint @psvt2 So true - and that tone - too beautiful! A rare talent indeed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@psvt2 The Vera Lynn number made me tear - my Gran used to sing that beautifully!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bazmint Just fantastic. I'm sure between tonight & Saturday the follower numbers are gonna rocket - and rightly so!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clareteal @themuddyfield Whoohoo - diet over!! Secret Love was just exquisite! Thoroughly enjoyed the show. Good on ya. Roll on Saturday!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow! Loving the Hooray for Hollywood Prom already and it's only just started! #BBCR3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry Mr Snail. I didn't mean to stand on you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bagsface You didn't! Silly, silly woman...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@psvt2 Sky+'d already!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@psvt2 Ta for reminder! Been a long while since I spent an evening in front of the wireless - looking forward! @clareteal 's gonna ace it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Having a Bank Holiday booty-shake... lookout Here comes the Hotstepper #IniKamoze<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been gardening my socks off since 9am.  Bleeding knackered & not quite done yet, but at least the shrub's not giving me the finger anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>David Jason's Greatest Escapes is captivating. Incredible stories!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now finished Mildred Pierce. Well acted and all, but I got bored halfway through.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thought I'd herald in my no-goodies diet with some lovely sultana scones, with strawberry jam & blobs of proper Cornish Clotted Cream.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just seen a bloke buy an extraordinary amt of household bleach from Sains - about 16 litres. Should I alert MI5?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mock the Week - Xhosa Football Commentary... brilliant!  http://t.co/Yya4fhs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenjoEllis  Hay caramba!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenjoEllis Can see you played a blistering set!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn't it funny how we give our cars, bikes, boats etc names that we'd never give our children. #Dorothy #Doris #Thelma #Phyllis #Bertha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenjoEllis Good night then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear Asda. I don't think a 1p saving should qualify as a "Rollback". Save the hoopla for a proper bargain. Maybe then I'll visit #justsaying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@themuddyfield Lol! Hey - easy on the reckless driving & bollard bashing in my neighbourhood ya hear!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenjoEllis My pet "peeve"!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really must get round 2 pruning the shrub outback. It's got a stray branch sticking up at an odd angle. It's like it's giving me the finger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That Jack Daniel's BBQ Sauce is rather moreish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's more warmth/ light since neighbour chopped their huge tree down, but I now have 15 mini trees growing on my front lawn #strayseeds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RT @BenjoEllis: @MicheJW Let's plan for Dec/ Jan next year?  I still have to squeeze in my Aus trip.. &lt;we can go there too ;) &gt; Yay!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RT @BenjoEllis: RT @MicheJW: Bring on the SA trip!! My feet are restless, and i'm in need of an adventure&gt;oh do bring it on. Me too!&gt; Me 3!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MicheJW But you've only just returned... again... lol! Let's plan for Dec/ Jan next year? I still have to squeeze in my Aus trip...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenjoEllis Not bad, but bugger all in that huge middle bit. Coastal route via PE far nicer - more to see, do & eat!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenjoEllis Yes - with great tunes and plenty to nibble! A taser & bit of mace is always a good idea, but then that's standard practise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenjoEllis Of course the fatigue could kill! Prefer more leisurely ambles thesedays!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenjoEllis SA Road Trip... my Mastermind subject!! Haven't lived 'til you've driven 17 hours straight, from Durbs to Cape Town...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That Irene is causing quite a stir.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenjoEllis We'd all have such a ball! Ask @MicheJW ... she knows all about it ;-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@psvt2 I rather fancy the Cleo gig, but it clashes with prelim CT plans...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenjoEllis You see now, you can't make that kind of decision without first visiting SA...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bagsface Did you ever master the ukelele?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GCPHOTO Figured you'd realise sooner or later! Aaahh... give her my love too! :-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GCPHOTO Ditto! Gotta love Twitter... ;-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GCPHOTO Awesome! Tell Fi I said she looks radiant - really lovely & Cor's rather dashing too! Ta for that ;-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GCPHOTO *thumbs up*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GCPHOTO Plez baas, tweet me a foto...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ooh - I got postal love from @StablesMK today. Kettle's on... about to settle down to have a gander...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GCPHOTO Fi & Corle that is...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GCPHOTO LOL! Wish the happy couple for me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GCPHOTO Ah yes, growing gnome syndrome...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@impuku Sheesh - ya tellin' me! #MineEyes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I find it mildly disconcerting that the Epol Dog Food logo features a seal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear Gentleman Cyclist. I feel that someone ought to tell you that white cycle shorts, particularly in wet weather, are not an ideal option.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's piddling, but I don't want to get my new umbrella-ella wet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The thing I miss least about living in the tropics? The big-ass cockroaches.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whoohoo... RWC is gonna be broadcast on ITV #Bokke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right, that's enough work for one day. Now off to test drive the shower smoothie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hello chocolate my old friend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Suspending disbelief for 40 mins to watch the Nikita finale.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@psvt2 Will have to synchronise diaries closer to the time - be nice to catch same show as the rest of the 'regulars'!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So if the sauce recipe calls for semi skimmed, but I use whole milk, will the world implode? #quandairy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@psvt2 Is the 18th THE Christmas gig? Christmas in UK this year so deffo plan to catch a Festive Fiesta - was bummed to miss out last year!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A whole lotta fun!  RT @qikipedia: How many States can you name in this game?  http://t.co/93pDMkJ<|endoftext|>
