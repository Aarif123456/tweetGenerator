<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog So should we address AOC as Bartender Cortez?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorOfLA  https://t.co/coF59G40LH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arellano_aiden @DodgersNation I said u are looking for hope. Meaning it’s not real but u have faith it can be. And since u know I’m right and u have no real argument, u decide to ask if I accepted Trumps loss because u can’t handle the truth? Lol hope you don’t raise your family with the same victim mentality<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arellano_aiden @DodgersNation You’re still in denial. You are looking for hope when it’s clear she is just being used as PR for a team that has 0 wins. Sorry you can’t see it. Hopefully they throw her out there every time they need a kicker so she can prove me wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trailblazers Very brave of the guy without a mask telling the guy without a mask to put his mask on...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@united Hope you go bankrupt!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arellano_aiden @DodgersNation On the contrary. I wish they’d let her kick all the FG. But they know dumbasses like you will think it’s “woke” and you can’t see that it’s all a PR stunt. If she was really good, she’d be kicking all the FG. But you’re too blind to see that they are just using her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DodgersNation Did you see that right after that, she kicked a 39-yard FG?! Oh wait... scratch that... looks like they have another kicker for that. Lol guess they don’t think she’s good enough to kick a FG. 🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorOfLA  https://t.co/UtGDkpE29W<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorOfLA You shutdown the DreamCenter who was providing free food and essentials to thousands of families daily! Shame on you! Thousands of families will now go without food because of your poor leadership.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC7 Time to shutdown the government! They are not essential.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom You’re shitting us, right? You are so disconnected from the people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benshapiro Kumail has become the real life Zoolander.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cut4 @MLB 2020 Champs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aubrey_huff At that point I would take a permanent vacation to Texas. Cant do “no travel” and be stuck in CA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC7 So like 30 people a day? How many people die on average in LA? Ready for the “EvEn OnE dEaTh Is ToO mAnY” comments from those who think death should never happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChefGruel ICU baseline during flu season is 90% and usually gets close to 100% but sure let’s shutdown all small businesses when we hit 85%...   https://t.co/pFfZqXEfOG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ninergrl6 Oh so you don’t mind putting the grocery workers in danger for your personal needs? Why don’t you grow your own food instead of being selfish and put peoples lives at risk. Check your privilege...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenQuin62369463 @littlelionwines @BNODesk How do these numbers compare to Florida?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ninergrl6 That’s stupid. My guess is u are able to work remotely and have no problem telling people to stay home because u are still able to make a living. And why don’t u share with us how u manage to get food each week? Surely u don’t put urself &amp; others in danger by going to the market.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom @BillNye Sweet! So reverse your shutdown of businesses if they work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ninergrl6 To your point, people are going to continue to ignore these orders. What’s the difference now? You think people are just going to magically start listening to these orders? Same orders = same results.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ronlin Newsom: let’s make sure we are the state with the absolute strictest orders to keep people in doors.  *6 months later*   Newsom: I’m told that we now lead the country in most cases even though we were extremely strict. It’s obvious that we need to try the exact same thing again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WontBeSilent2 @perrykeet @BillFOXLA We dont want handouts, we want to open up our business.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trix_polly @BillFOXLA @yashar Wait, you were outside?! How dare you! YoU aRe PaRt Of ThE pRoBlEm!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@avenaim Being a business owner in California during COVID.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@catgeyser @GavinNewsom This is like thanking your husband for being by your side for 20 years and asking him to please stop cheating on you 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSanest @MrLChristmas @piersmorgan Again - that’s racist to wear black face. Your re causing division.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSanest @MrLChristmas @piersmorgan You’re obviously racist because you are wearing black face on your profile pic. Have you no shame?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Left: everyone needs to stay in doors! Don’t be a covidiot!  Also the Left: I order DoorDash because obviously I need to eat and I’m supporting the hard workers.  Also the Left: I went to hangout with 10 friends indoors but we are safe people so it’s obviously OK. #covid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Liz_Wheeler The people justifying this are the same people who shame others for being outdoors while they order DoorDash all day. It’s always justified when they put people in danger so long as it’s for their personal benefit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cernovich Where’s a good place to dine out in Los Angeles tomorrow?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorOfLA Remember when he was so proud of being the strictest county in the USA and now we are breaking records for cases?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cernovich @MayorOfLA I got banned from messaging on the live because I like to report facts 🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RubinReport @ericgarcetti Can we convince her to open up her outdoor dining and just all show up and support?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joelbodker @JoeBiden Nothing to see here...   https://t.co/ijkr5CPuYQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LegendaryEnergy “So different it’s unbelievable” does not qualify as “science” to back up this dweebs claims.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KingJames Democrats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorOfLA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrandonStraka @CNN @MSNBC @PolitiFact @snopes Today, we saw efforts from Democrats that were heroic. While all Republican volunteers complained about late night work, 4 dedicated Democrats stayed behind to get the job done. They are fulfilling their patriotic duty to the American people while Republicans are too lazy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RubinReport Let’s do this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC7 So Wal Mart and Costco?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdriannaIsabel @dannygokey @MayorOfLA How many times have you ordered food to be delivered to your home? Or gone to the grocery store? Because it sounds like you are OK putting other peoples lives in danger to get what you need while trying to shame people who want to open things back up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC Do you give every employee part ownership of the company?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmdesoer @nik_nasty @MayorOfLA I’m sure this bitch has no problem making sure her DoorDasher works long hours so she gets her food delivered. Everyone that serves you should work. Check your privilege.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorOfLA 🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TinaM777 @sliccardo Haha this is obviously Sam’s burner account. No one is this stupid. Nice try!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow! Nice! All the Dems who broke the rule.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonAguirre4real @MatthewBarnett 99.98% survival rate. And if the man is still afraid, he can stay home. Plenty of coaches out there not afraid to lead a team. And children are more likely to die from lightning than COVID. Living in fear is not living.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kerpen @Liz_Wheeler The sad part is all these people who make excuses for them when they do it. Got family and friends who wil say “they made a mistake! It’s OK.” Sad to see it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorOfLA Donate 100% of your salary to show everyone you truly understand what people are going through right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog Matt, I can answer that for you since I identify as a PHD, MD, Esquire. A woman is someone with a vagina. Unless they have a penis. Then they are a “woman”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lacountyparks @SheilaKuehl @LACountyLibrary @lacdbh @LAFoodBank Will there be some Il Forno Trattoria?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LegendaryEnergy This is how I imagine covid would look under a microscope<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Elex_Michaelson @SheilaKuehl When asked why she was dining out, she said it was perfectly fine because there was no data to support a ban of dining outdoors. #owned<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndreaKuszewski @zkent @catturd2 @realDonaldTrump Then why the mask?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC7 Guys, please keep in mind that she decided that COVID couldn’t get her until the next day. So she was safe. Plus, she had her fingers crossed and you can’t catch it when your fingers are crossed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LegendaryEnergy 99.99% survival rate with my immune system vs. a vaccine with a 90% success rate.... 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog The only correct answer is that we obviously have to wait to see what CNN tells us to do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TonKosix @BillFOXLA @FOXLA @SheilaKuehl I got a bridge to sell you....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom My guess is all the “shut everything down” people can work remotely and have no problem putting other people in danger so they can get the DoorDash. Funny how that works.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IranPat9 @GavinNewsom I’m a Mexican business owner who voted Trump. Do you support me? If you say “yes”, you go against what you believe. If you say “no” you are basically telling me to go back to Mexico. Which is it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trcexy @espn Either you dont get the joke or you love soccer so much this made you cry. I’m guessing it’s the former...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@espn Wow, I never thought college football would stoop this low. I mean, we know they get hurt much easier. Never thought I would see the shameful day that college football allowed a soccer player on the field.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DanRafael1 How do you live with yourself knowing that the only way you can stay at home comfortably is to put others at risk to work to get you food? You are so selfish! And all the extra food you are obviously eating should he donated. Shame on you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MatthewBarnett Boom!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cernovich Where are the recall Newsom locations set up?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom  https://t.co/KwcYaq8q0J<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yashar Can you breakdown the percentages into actual cases/deaths/hospitalizations? Good for context.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maggieNYT @yashar Whatever happens, happens. As long as it’s the people’s vote making the decisions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LegendaryEnergy I feel like the new Story thing on Twitter is just to hide all the “Live Now” I was used to seeing. Now IDK when Trump or anyone on his team is live and bringing us new info.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benshapiro PS5 is a human right!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoriBush So teachers should teach for free cuz I ain’t paying for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MelissaAFrancis @NYCMayor @GavinNewsom is making a good run at the title.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC7  https://t.co/DQyZMbkwxt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec Andy Ngô has some crazy skills! Can’t believe he edited in all those people harassing children. Looks 100% real.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealDWDuck @hollyrpeete  https://t.co/yoR7foFhar Yeah......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HavenGram @Cernovich Nothing in your message said anything about Obama. Not sure if you responded to the right tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@themouthmatusow Mike, just let it play it out. Nothing wrong with allowing the legal process to be completed. Obviously it doesn’t look great for Trump, but if people want to have hope, don’t take that away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cernovich So its settled. Regardless of the outcome, we can all agree Trump was better and more popular than Obama.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LZGranderson Dems spent $40MM on the Russia Hoax. Just let this play out. It will be better for the country to accept the results.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@phila_nikki @cabbobby @ABC Stop trying to change the convo. Can you confirm that there WAS someone prior to Trump that didn’t concede? The article says it hasn’t happened. Robert provided proof it has.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joelcomm @JackPosobiec @OANN @CNN CNN just confirmed that you didn’t say this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LegendaryEnergy What’s your prediction? Emotions aside? You think Trump will get re-elected? #Trump2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@osidegrillz @DanRafael1 @realDonaldTrump So you tried both and you prefer Dan’s lonja? Well good for you! My sure that price on your lap knows you prefer men’s lonjas over dick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@osidegrillz @DanRafael1 @realDonaldTrump I know what it means. Just expect that from a 12 year old girl. Not a grown ass man. But you do you, little man. You keep sucking on Dan’s lonja! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@osidegrillz @DanRafael1 @realDonaldTrump Wambulance? Give the phone back you your dad, kid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanRafael1 @realDonaldTrump Just like ESPN did with you. 😊<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MeghanMcCain @RubinReport what’s up with your sister?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JoeBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewYang The concern is Dems have such a hard time accepting that Americans have different views. They believe in “agree with more or you’re racist!”. Stop trying to force everyone to think like you. Be better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC7 @JoeBiden COVID is gone just like that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewYang And just like that, COVID was gone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealKidPoker @realDonaldTrump Kinda like how your did losing $300K yesterday? Super rage! Hahahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrahamAllen_1 Dems have become the 2017 Astros and the crazy libs are the Astros fan defending them to the death.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ighaworth @realDailyWire Biden will be declared winner. They will recount and find fraud. Trump declared winner. Riots begin and it’s the beginning of the end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ksorbs Can’t wait for the libs to be like “But my grandma would’ve wanted Trump out so it’s OK!”<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@joecollins43rd @RealDeanCain Nice! I voted there too 💪🏼 time to bring home the W!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PersianReign @TenPointPG Just put your picture next to the quote it becomes true. Apparently that’s what makes things true to this guy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aubrey_huff How I wish you were right about CA, but that’s not likely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDailyWire  https://t.co/iODY6Knciw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Acosta @mattyhoyeCNN Kind of looks like every Halloween store yesterday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealKidPoker This is just like the “what about rape and incest” argument for abortion. It’s rare and shouldn’t be the premise of your argument.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MatthewBarnett Maybe the families should protest the decision? They can hold the protests at the rose bowl the same day as the games.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kumailn Yes! Vote Trump!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@inperfectbalan1 @Ja1Ke3 @lisabuentello @ericcervini  https://t.co/ALInk8oBID<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoseKingJr @hpdudads @Xager20 @dayyanl @kumailn I’ll leave this here in case you forgot what my question (that you keep dodging) was:  If the cutoff to mail in your ballot is changed, doesn’t that affect all voters?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoseKingJr @hpdudads @Xager20 @dayyanl @kumailn Everyone in the US can request an absentee ballot. Lots of people got a ballot this year without even requesting. But you still bitch and complain. You’re just preparing for an excuse when Trump wins. Cry hard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoseKingJr @hpdudads @Xager20 @dayyanl @kumailn You keep dodging that question, bandana man. Same thing with sheep like you. Avoid the questions. Throw around “facts” and insults and laugh really hard. But I see through you. You’re just a broke boy living with mommy and daddy with nothing better to do. Cute.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoseKingJr @hpdudads @Xager20 @dayyanl @kumailn I live in the hood. Got 3 voting places around my house. I don’t need an ID to vote. Just a name and address. And I’m a minority. Lol turn off the TV and stop being a victim bro.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoseKingJr @hpdudads @Xager20 @dayyanl @kumailn And yet you have yet to present an answer to my question. I get it, you keep throwing “facts” on Twitter hoping people don’t see you avoiding the question. How cute.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoseKingJr @hpdudads @Xager20 @dayyanl @kumailn Let’s try this again, you seem slow. The question I asked was:  If the cutoff to mail in your ballot is changed, doesn’t that affect all voters?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoseKingJr @hpdudads @Xager20 @dayyanl @kumailn “It’s the GOP who is actively trying to make it harder for people to vote.” Ohhh I see. There is all the proof I needed. Lol que pendejo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoseKingJr @hpdudads @Xager20 @dayyanl @kumailn “You’re not paying attention” doesn’t really answer the question here, does it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hpdudads @Xager20 @dayyanl @kumailn Please elaborate. If the cutoff to mail in your ballot is changed, doesn’t that affect all voters? Where are you getting that the GOP doesn’t want to count all votes?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bwagsports @VeniceMase You’re right. It was a lot tougher! Asterisk for the hardest playoffs ever. Super Champs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC7Veronica @ABC7 You mean he was around the people he had been around for days? Oh no!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nikpalch @LAIreland What’s that now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cody_Bellinger @ericgarcetti Bet! Let’s call it a protest and that means COVID can’t get us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ramonashelburne @JoyTaylorTalks He was with the team all night. What difference did it make at that point?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@espn He was with them the entire night. What difference does it make?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VeniceMase 🙋🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VeniceMase Send out Buehler!!!!! Don’t let this one slip away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BauerOutage As a Dodgers fan, I was stoked! I figured he’d go 8+ and force game 7.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VeniceMase Dodgers need to keep it a 1-run game through 5. Snell will implode in the 5th-6th.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DodgersNation That was huge! It might help swing the momentum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DougPolkVids Out of curiosity, did you think Hillary was ahead the same way in 2016?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BoSnerdley Don’t tease us with a good time.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LAIreland Can’t believe I’m saying this but that was some good managing by Roberts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VeniceMase I think you send Kersh out there after his best inning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VeniceMase Roberts pitching/defensive decisions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CespedesBBQ When they brought Jansen in the game<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LZGranderson  https://t.co/Lzkgx4pCtm You contradict yourself. Your initial message says he refuses to say NHL because they didn’t engage. So which is it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sedano Jorge, that makes too much sense. You know that won’t be the case with Roberts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TravisRodgers I yelled that when they brought in Jansen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VeniceMase @LAIreland It IS a piece of cake if they game is managed correctly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VeniceMase First reaction is to be mad at Jansen. But it’s obviously Roberts lack of management skills. He made bad moves today. He needs to be replaced.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SportsCenter Every true Dodgers fan knew it was over when we saw Jansen enter the game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brookme3 @DodgersNation Is it too late to send him home and bring in, I don’t know, anyone else?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Riggins5582 @DodgersNation The accountability is on Roberts, not Jansen. Kenley comes on when he’s asked to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DodgersNation AT LEAST OWN IT! Broooooooo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BelliBetts @killahbrian7 @DodgersNation You must be new here...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stephenasmith @Dodgers Pray that’s true!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timcates It’s Roberts fault<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DodgersNation Does Roberts think this is a Hallmark feel good movie? Don’t put Jansen in!!!!!! He’s washed up!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sedano It’s Dave Roberts still thinking this is a feel good story. Why the f*** is Jansen in there?!?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DodgersNation Nah, f*** this bullsh**. I’m done<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DodgersNation Tell me again why we haven’t fired mother F****en ROBERTS!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timcates Roberts likes to make stupid decisions in big games<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DodgersNation Roberts, you son of a bitch, you. We have a love/hate relationship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DodgersNation Still gonna protect Roberts?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VeniceMase Makes sense. Just sucks that Urias isn’t lined up for a W.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yashar If he was a Republican, this would be played around the clock on CNN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewYang To the next chapter in Trumps Presidency<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cernovich But we all knew that Dems were going to vote by mail. Just wait until we see record lows for in person voting from the Dems come November 3rd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KayRiel17 @AOC How you gonna yell and wake up your man like that?! The disrespect is so purposeful and childish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC Just wait until you see record lows on Election Day to balance the young voter turnout<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VeniceMase Jansen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pedro_lopes45 @KamalaHarris Correct. If you have no brain, vote for Biden.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EricJRacy @ABC7 Agree with me or you’re a cult member!  🤣🤣🤣🤣 Do you realize how stupid hou sound?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DodgersNation If Dodgers come back to win this one, I’ll buy a plane ticket to be in Texas for the clincher<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VeniceMase Gm3 - Buehler Gm4 - Urias Gm5 - Kershaw Gm6 - Buehler Gm7 - Everyone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DodgersNation These are the true fans. They are emotionally invested and just want to see a Dodgers WS Championship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VeniceMase @VeniceMase pretty close!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JesseGuzman11 @LZGranderson But you keep voting for the same people who keep you down. They don’t even have to try. They know your vote is in the bag.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealKidPoker @JoeBiden @SenKamalaHarris Sounds like you are voting based on emotion and not any policies. Sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DodgersNation If you have been through the ups and downs for the last 10 years, screaming at Twitter and the TV is part of the process. We say “fire Roberts” and change the channel when the Dodgers get behind, but we are loyal and always come back. Hope this is the year!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MLB @Dodgers @Braves Dodgers will keep it close enough to give us faith, but break our heart at the end. Hope I’m wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DodgersNation Dodger fans will never trust anything or anyone until we get to celebrate a WS win. It’s been a rough ride with a lot of crushed dreams. We have trust issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRealJHair And THIS is another reason Roberts should be fired<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jettagirl09 @matthewjdowd When you start losing arguments, you become the victim it seems.<|endoftext|>
