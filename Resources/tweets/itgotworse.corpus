<|startoftext|>@ajay43 @Sanginamby We, me &amp; Ajay, studied Sanskrit from 8th to 10th. Explanations were in English, and we wrote the final paper in English.

The Doctor and the reporter will be her witnesses, to be cross-examined by the prosecution.   Social media is not the fora for such examinations. That's where the defence team has erred.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amithpr The person may be no more, but people are claiming through him.  So, the law of torts applies to slander/libel. IPC doesn't come into play.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amithpr He who has evidence should reveal it only when asked for to the investigating agencies or the court of law as the case may be.   If done elsewhere, and to all &amp; sundry, it ain't evidence but gossip/libel/slander.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@harsh8848 Boss, if there is a tripartite agreement (Tenant/Landlord/Banker) there will never be a 'Force Majeure' clause as Bankers' do not agree.

<|startoftext|>@harsh8848 You've got it wrong. Commercial tenancy agreements carry a 'Force Majeure' clause. Landlords do not agree to this clause. Always advised my clients to have it inserted.

<|startoftext|>@greenmay25 @ajay43 @LouvinaA @RoshniManglore I know one who was woken up at the crack of dawn. Groggy &amp; disoriented he answered the call; it was a customer enquiring at what time he would be able to deliver if order was placed just then. And the grocer did not even know that he was on a list prepared by the DC! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greenmay25 @ajay43 @LouvinaA @RoshniManglore They are publishing the list &amp; inconveniencing shop keepers as not all have stocks.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ajay43 @MangaloreCity @scshenoy @nistula They won't.   The MLA + Minister speak of:   "Some 400 shops including super markets ward wise will be allowed for ONLY DOOR DELIVERY of groceries."  This in Mangalore City where the population is 5.2 lacs approx.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouvinaA @ajay43 @RoshniManglore And for every one of the meetings, the ubiquitous architect is present. I asked the traders if the meeting called for was to build a hospital. They tell me, he has his finger in all discussions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ajay43 @LouvinaA @RoshniManglore Pure &amp; unadulterated!   The delivery boys have to be hired by the shop keeper &amp; he can charge for the delivery of groceries.

<|startoftext|>@retheeshraj10 Stupidity?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nobody knows what's going to happen tomorrow. Is there easing of the lockdown? What about essential commodities? (Not that anything is left in the shops)   Where do we go from here?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meanwhile the lack of coordination between the bureaucracy &amp; the politicians is showing up. Decisions are taken by the Minister in Charge. The DC seems to be sidelined. And the whole process is garbled. The effect is that the admin &amp; the people are all groping in the dark!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The factory has some stock lying in its godown, but no one can go and get the commodity. Also, production cannot be kickstarted when the lockdown is in place<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two of his trucks supplying stocks to nearby villages were stopped by the cops &amp; the drivers were harassed. Therefore, he has closed the factory, workers can't come to work because there is no transport &amp; his drivers have gone home. So production &amp; supply is at a standstill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even if he had the stock, he couldn't have delivered the same owing to the complete lockdown. Meanwhile at the factory from where he gets his stock, 35 kms from HQ, the Panchayat closed the factory complaining that workers congregating isn't social distancing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ajay43   Ground reality in our Home Town:   Just got off the line speaking to a wholesaler of an essential commodity. His godowns have been empty from the past three days. Since yesterday, his retailers are asking for replenishments, which he doesn't have.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@synchronise1857 What, then, shall we say in response to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@synchronise1857 I agree. But what with all that crowding &amp; exodus of people?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@suchetadalal Comes across as a retired bureaucrat. The privileged kind!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@synchronise1857 Zilch.  We are looking at a tsunami.  And the ruling dispensation is deciding on what bikini to wear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seemay Sad on so many counts.  May their souls rest in peace.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bainjal With the TV on?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@synchronise1857 Ms. Singh, lockdown has failed.   We lost the window of opportunity to, first, delay in lockdown &amp; second, the exodus of our poor &amp; marginalised brethren.    Period.   Now it's testing and isolating.  And keeping the supplies coming in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ajay43 @PrakashJavdekar It's his 'Marie Antoinette' moment. One can't wake people with a dead man's conscience. Let him be. It takes all kinds to make the world go around.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nit_set The ruling dispensation &amp; their paid minions are bigots &amp; rabble-rousers at best. What would they know of managing a crisis?<|endoftext|>

Scared shitless too.  He has a penchant for rabble-rousing. But then, can't encounter this virus.  Hiding, is my safe bet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ajay43 The IAS &amp; IPS cadre are well looked after  The politicians too.   Snap of a finger &amp; they get their daily bread served piping hot even under a virus attack.  And they are the ones, sitting in controlled environment that decide what the man on the street deserves.  We are screwed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tweeterdinesh @tejujoshi31 Which part of her? ü§î<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ajay43 The will &amp; pleasure of the Minister for the District.   There is absolute lack of coordination between the politicians &amp; the administration. And amongst the administration themselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meanwhile in Mangaluru:  Police: "Hence, it will be a complete lockdown. Police will be on rounds from 5.30 am. No one should be spotted on roads." DC : "milk, newspaper shops and pharmacy will be kept open."  Today: Market overflows with people despite total lockdown @ajay43<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ajay43 Next would be film stars. While at it he should ask @SrBachchan to take a break from social media. PM is behind the curve, Big B has gone off the bend.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KhalDrogoGooner @yehlog The ruling dispensation is adept at bribing MLAs.  That's their expertise.   This is different. An out of syllabus question that has stumped them.

<|startoftext|>@harsh8848 @Loquacious_Lion There was gratification involved.

The public were largely unaware of the games played by these threesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ajay43 @Ram_Guha Bro, on side you have Mr. Ram Guha &amp; on the other Mr. C. T. Ravi. Now, whose orders do the police follow? That makes the difference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only an impartial inquiry will bring out the truth, the whole truth &amp; nothing but the truth!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harsh8848 @Loquacious_Lion The bankers don't look into the fiscal discipline of the big borrowers. That's where the diversion takes place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harsh8848 Also his was a disaster waiting to happen from Audit POV. The Auditors are given just a small window within which the audit has to be accomplished. There is a competition as to which bank's audited financials are published first. Usually by April end results are published.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was when the firing took place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That brought in more rabble rousers from the byelanes of Bunder &amp; surrounding areas. The mob swelled, laid siege to the Bunder Police Station. The police charged at the mob with lathis &amp; they entered nearby buildings from where the attack on cops continued.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some people defied Sec 144 &amp; came out to protest against #CAA. That was the cue. Stones were pelted (looks like both sides of the political spectrum indulged in stone throwing) The police had to lathi charge the mob.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What happened in Mangaluru?   In my opinion, the situation was pre-planned. Both sides of the political spectrum are responsible. The police had prior information that there is bound to be trouble, &amp; they were wary but well prepared.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Three eessentials procedures related to the principles of natural justice.  1. No one should be a judge in his own matter. 2. No one can be condemned unheard. 3. The party is entitled to know each and every reason and the decision taken by the authority.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Purpose of the principle 1. To provide equal opportunity of being heard. 2. Concept of Fairness. 3. To fulfil the gaps and loopholes of the law. 4. To protect the Fundamental Rights. 5. Basic features of the Constitution. 6. No miscarriage of Justice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3. ‚ÄúReasoned Decision‚Äù which states that order, decision or judgement of the court given by the Presiding authorities with a valid and reasonable ground.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2. ‚ÄúBias rule‚Äù generally expresses that panel of expert should be biased free while taking the decision. The decision should be given in a free and fair manner which can fulfil the rule of natural justice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*PRINCIPLES OF NATURAL JUSTICE*  Natural justice consists of 3 rules.  1. ‚ÄúHearing rule‚Äù which states that the person or party who is affected by the decision made by the panel of expert members should be given a fair opportunity to express his point of view to defend himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The common man‚Äôs faith in the justice system is at an all-time low. As can be seen, Judiciary is unable to handle the ‚Äúavalanche‚Äù of litigation. It has become overworked and has lost its efficiency.   Justice delayed is justice denied and Justice hurried is justice buried.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>7. Is it because of archaic laws that fill up the statute books?  8. Or is it because of faulty or vague drafting of laws and their multiple interpretations by various courts?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4. Is it because there are not enough courts? 5. Is it because the government is the largest litigant? 6. Is it because judicial system has miserably failed to attract the best brains and the talented students?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is reported that at least five crore cases are filed every year and judges dispose of only two crore. What could be the reasons?   1. Is it increase in the awareness of rights by common man? 2. Is it because of increase in PILs? 3. Is it because of paucity of Judges?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In all there are 3.3 crore cases pending in Indian courts. According to National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG), the 5 states which account for the highest pendency are UP (61.58 lakh), Maharashtra (33.22 lakh), West Bengal (17.59 lakh), Bihar (16.58 lakh) and Gujarat (16.45 lakh).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>58,669 cases were pending in the Supreme Court  In the High Courts, 399 posts, or 37 per cent of sanctioned judge-strength, are vacant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>26.76 lakh of these cases are less than five years old, 8.44 lakh are pending for more than five years but less than 10 years and 8.35 lakh are over 10 year old.<|endoftext|>
