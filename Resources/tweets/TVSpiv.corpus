<|startoftext|>@Ofcom I hope you‚Äôre going to investigate the @BBCNews bias. 9:40 Sunday morning and #BBCNewsChannel they have 2 panelist‚Äôs both #AntiBrexit and no @ProBrexit so much for #BalancedNews #BiasedBroadcastingCorporation #leftieluvies #woke<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Thank god for #netflix #AmazonPrimeVideo #skytv and #NowTV   #TerrestrialTV is killing itself thanks to @BBCOne &amp; @itv especially their #PrimeTime weekend shows and repeats   @NetflixUK @primevideouk @NOWTV @skytv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another #Saturdaynight of @DrossTV on @itv and @bbcone at least the latter isn‚Äôt the #repeat fest that #ITV is #catchphrase &amp; #celebritychase repeats &amp; even #itllbealrightonthenight is effectively recycling clips we‚Äôve all pretty much seen before<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mcn_jackie @spenn88 @piersmorgan He may be using a bad example to make a point but it‚Äôs true. I‚Äôve known of a builder who fell off a ladder on a building site to his death &amp; an elderly lady who succumbed to cancer after a long battle,  both were recorded as #COVID19 deaths because they‚Äôd tested positive recently<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Oh wow. Considering the delay between mixing, infecting, hospitalisation etc that almost sounds like #LockdownDoesntWork #GoFigure I do hope the government and media aren‚Äôt lying to us about how we should behave?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any believe we‚Äôve got #itllbealrightonthenight on Christmas night too! #SoDull unfunny boring and @davidwalliams narration makes me cringe. It‚Äôs like celebrity #YouveBeenFramed with the same awful scriptwriter that @harryhill uses @itv #GetAGrip<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So sad to hear #BarbaraWindsor has passed away #RIP lovely last and comedy genius  https://t.co/uUF3XH10eV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When your #Christmas morning is put the kids in front of a family film giving you time to prepare #Christmasdinner then you find out @itv are putting #lorraine and #ThisMorning on instead @lorraine @thismorning #ffs  https://t.co/87PeSNDpOl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB Do you include those not vaccinated for #measles, #mumps or #rubella?

<|startoftext|>@Green_Fairys Me too<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 @SkyNews How come footballers think Black Lives Matter but not Gay lives? #LGBTQ+ community not represented in a single professional team globally because of fear and yet that‚Äôs ok according to them and the #footballassociation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It shows how dire #BritishTV has got when the funniest thing on #SaturdayNight #PrimeTime is a poor video quality showing of a 34 year old TV show #blackadder series 2. #rowanatkinson should redo it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElizabethD2410 So similar. I wanted to stay awake watching #ItllBeAlrightOnTheNight but failed thankfully<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iCrowby And it‚Äôs been shown a million times<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tipcharles @CunningtonE @antanddec @itv2 @ITV @imacelebrity They‚Äôve done a fabulous job but it doesn‚Äôt take a planning genius to realise if you need to give staff a day off you do it Monday or Tuesday like the hospitality trade do and not Saturday night which is peak time. Otherwise you badly upset your patrons who pay your wages<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CunningtonE @antanddec @itv2 @ITV @imacelebrity Sorry I was trying a bit of sarcastic humour lol. @antanddec are passionate about their viewers but we have to disagree about @itv given their propensity to show repeats, Sunday afternoon is just Sat night on repeat, plus their obsession with reality shows &amp; Gemmacollins ilk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alan_McWhan @antanddec @ITV @imacelebrity In fact I wouldn‚Äôt mind betting they‚Äôve #muted or #blocked me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alan_McWhan @antanddec @ITV Agreed on Hollie. The editors really influence voting but I still think for a Saturday night prime time show it‚Äôs a total cop out. Not that @antanddec @itv @imacelebrity will give a shit as they clearly don‚Äôt really care about their fans given the last two weekends<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kieran_keek I agree @antanddec @imacelebrity @itv hang your heads in shame. Such an important topic ignored #imacelebrity #ImaCeleb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CunningtonE @antanddec @itv2 Oh you mean #ImACelebrityExtraCamp wow if only they‚Äôd thought of that! Oh hang on they did but they ditched it because they don‚Äôt care about their viewers @ITV @imacelebrity @antanddec<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alan_McWhan An improvement but come on do you really expect this for the biggest TV night of the week? #shoddy #CheapTV utter contempt for viewers @antanddec @itv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Will199624 @Catchphrase @StephenMulhern @ITVChase @BradleyWalsh @imacelebrity @antanddec @ImACelebZone_ @ITV @putthetellyon @TVSatelliteWeek It was shit and is typical #RepeatTV from @itv @StephenMulhern you should be ashamed to be associated with it for #Primetime Saturday night<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dan_Mc_Loughlin I agree it should have been in the main show<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@antanddec @itv are you really listening and interested?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@antanddec We did think it ok &amp; better than last week but please whatever happens next year if you‚Äôre going to have a day off make it a Monday &amp; not Saturday. It‚Äôs the one night we want to be entertained,  not bored. #ImaCeleb #ImACelebrity<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@allantanddec Should be reheated Saturday night‚Äôs pizza to match the rubbish the viewers and fans got served yesterday. #ImACeleb @antanddec<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imacelebrity You gave us a repeat of what we had already seen &amp; the teaser of extra bits was pathetic. I turned off after 15 mins. #zerocostTV #CheapAndPathetic #PatronisingViewers #PrimeTimeTV what a joke. #ImaCeleb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackSparkly @imacelebrity @ITV They‚Äôd have been better saying it wasn‚Äôt on and showing something else than try to fob people off with a recap show of what we have been watching for 6 days with a few extra bits. #ImACeleb @itv @antanddec @imacelebrity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrhar10 @antanddec @ITV @imacelebrity It was clearly planned as they had prerecorded it and also the media were full of the fact that this Saturday and next Saturday will be recap shows. It proves the contempt @antanddec and @itv are treating their fans @imacelebrity #ImACeleb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun @MailOnline @dailystar @guardian come on guys fans are revolting and calling for a boycott of voting on #ImACeleb tomorrow in protest of @itv and @antanddec fobbing us off with a recap 6 days in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@antanddec How about you check the #ImaCeleb feed and you might see how pissed you and @itv have made the fans of the show with your #recap that was the favourite bit as it showed the massive majority thought you guys and @imacelebrity were pissing on us<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Channel4 showing #Xmenlaststand after midnight and @itv showing #ImaCeleb recap show #Primetime what is wrong with #TVPlanners this is so messed up and the wrong way round @antanddec<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrGeorgeClarke  What‚Äôs going on? #UglyHouseToLovelyHouse but it‚Äôs another #Uglyhousetoevenuglierhouse  https://t.co/F1KJgkoc78<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaackaro Agreed. @BBCNews propaganda based on opinion not facts. But I‚Äôm having #Christmas &amp; if Hancock &amp; Johnson‚Äôs think I‚Äôm going to hide from a virus less deadly than flu they can do one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhoPotterVian @ITV @antanddec But still watch. It‚Äôll make it clear to @ITV @antanddec and their advertisers that they can‚Äôt recycle repeats even if a good show and expect people to be gullible enough to just put up with it and watch it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhoPotterVian @ITV @antanddec Only boycott the recap and tomorrow‚Äôs vote with a social media post tagged #BoycottSunday and tweet to explain why<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you love @antanddec &amp; #ImACeleb but felt letdown by #recap episode? Well let‚Äôs send a message to @imacelebrity &amp; @itvstudios with #BoycottSunday.

<|startoftext|>@louaze @imacelebrity Have you never watched #ImACeleb before in the last 20 series? The recap ONLY happens at the end in the round up show<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come one #ImACeleb fans get behind the #RecapBoycott and stop @ITV treating us like idiots. @antanddec you have the power to stop this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlanK783 I‚Äôm the same. I‚Äôve watched every episode since @tonyblackburn first walked in but one more mid-series #recap and I‚Äôm gone for good @antanddec @imacelebrity @itvstudios #ImACeleb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TsukiWaza @imacelebrity @ITV @antanddec Agreed but I won‚Äôt just be switching off the recap show I‚Äôll be gone for good #ImACeleb #imacelebrity @itv @itvstudios<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SillyFizzy @itv and @antanddec have agreed #PrimeTime Saturday night is only worthy of a recap show of the last 6 days of #ImACeleb so it‚Äôs up to viewers to vote with their remotes if they agree. #ImBoredLetMeOutOfHere and I‚Äôve switched off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dailystar @itv do not understand their audience. We aren‚Äôt thick, we know a repeat when we see it. Our memories aren‚Äôt those of a goldfish or impacted by #COVID19 we can remember the last 6 days and I‚Äôm disappointed @antanddec went along with it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So true. @itv producers @antanddec #YouHadOneJob<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhoPotterVian @antanddec Agreed. Out of interest what do you think of them doing a recap episode every Saturday?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Notice @antanddec haven‚Äôt even tweeted about this dire #recap episode #ImACeleb more like #HowToKillAShow. #boring #imacelebrity @itvstudios @itv congrats #primetime Saturday night to showcase a dull recap episode. Someone needs firing. Anyone else turned off?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xnebulawolfx Because @itv @itvstudios would milk a fly to get an extra episode and @antanddec aren‚Äôt doing themselves any favours agreeing to it. They could kill the goose that‚Äôs laid the golden egg for so many years<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhoPotterVian @antanddec I was actually enjoying most of it but the atmosphere is not there as it‚Äôs all filmed at night indoors so it‚Äôs like a studio and then they pull this recap episode stunt. #ImACeleb #ImBored<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@antanddec @itv @imacelebrity goodbye for tonight. If it‚Äôs not bad enough every night feels like it‚Äôs in a studio and it‚Äôs 2 days shorter, we don‚Äôt even get a proper episode tonight. #MilkingATurd #boring time to bring it to an end until Australia is open again #ImACeleb<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JillSte30223460 @officialbobzta @EamonnHolmes @thismorning @BBCOne @RuthieeL Here we go, start with the keyboard insults. If someone says something you disagree with they must be right-wing fascists who read the Daily Mail. Well I‚Äôve voted for all three main political parties. I despise bigotry in all forms &amp; I‚Äôve never supported any extreme organisation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JillSte30223460 @officialbobzta @EamonnHolmes @thismorning @BBCOne @RuthieeL But the press are saying it‚Äôs a diversity decision, that means they‚Äôre not doing it cos she is good, which she is funny &amp; entertaining, they are doing it because of colour and doing that is racist however you dress it up. I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôd rather get it for her skills not her colour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JillSte30223460 @officialbobzta @EamonnHolmes @thismorning @BBCOne @RuthieeL Don‚Äôt you read posts before going off on one? I said I like her and think she deserves promotion. I just think keeping the childish Schofield and Willoughby and getting rid of Eamonn &amp; Ruth is wrong. The latter are genuine and relatable but how many relate to a childish 57yr old?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tears to hear #DesOConnor has died.

<|startoftext|>@officialbobzta @EamonnHolmes @thismorning @BBCOne @RuthieeL And they‚Äôve also never had a #trans person in a permanent role, nor a #bisexual one nor any lesbians or gays, until Schofield came out making it a fair accompli for them. So how many of any of these have you seen presenting mainstream programmes on #ITV?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@officialbobzta @EamonnHolmes @thismorning @BBCOne @RuthieeL Making a decision based on someone‚Äôs colour is racist. Check the #EqualityAct2010  It works both ways, #PositiveDiscrimination is still #discrimination and 2 wrongs don‚Äôt make a right. I‚Äôve also said I like Alison and think she should be promoted. Why not reduce Schofield‚Äôs hours<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EamonnHolmes Can‚Äôt believe @thismorning are being so #ageist &amp; #racist. Being a fellow white, middle class male I feel we are becoming the minority on TV #ThisMorning. @BBCOne should poach you and @RuthieeL for #MorningLive &amp; make it 2 hours<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheVoiceUK @itv please cut out the back story stuff. Even celebrities admit they record it so they can cut it out. It slows the flow, it‚Äôs boring and means less people watch live which can‚Äôt be good for #Advertisers and revenue. #GetAGrip #SortItOut<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheSun @MailOnline @DailyMirror let‚Äôs see your true #journalistic colours then. #peston and @SteveBakerHW all but tried to humiliate @NadiaWhittomeMP tonight.

<|startoftext|>Watching #Ghosts and it‚Äôs terrible, no it‚Äôs so good, no it‚Äôs awful, no it‚Äôs really great. Well ok it‚Äôs not bad, no it really is so funny. Oh ok yes I love it. #Rentaghost for the 21st Century and @Charitchie is brilliant as is the rest of the cast<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ShawTiane @antanddec @AshleyBanjo Wow so nasty. I‚Äôve actually got loads of black friends &amp; as for coverage, anything which exposes abuse like those police I support, but I think it needs doing in the right way. Maybe if you loved all races, religions, sexual orientation et al as much you wouldn‚Äôt be so bitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShawTiane @antanddec @AshleyBanjo Are you serious? Have you not heard of the Human Rights Act? You can‚Äôt get more political. The right to liberation and life should be a given but politics dictate it. Get real or get lost<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@scottjelfs @dhinycascyn @antanddec @AshleyBanjo So sad but so true<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dhinycascyn @antanddec @AshleyBanjo For centuries all races, creeds, colours, sexes and sexual orientation minorities have been oppressed by the local country majority. Some humans have abused their position for all time so don‚Äôt make this about one section of it. We all need to change<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dhinycascyn @antanddec @AshleyBanjo No, course not. Family dying over centuries in workhouses isn‚Äôt white slavery. Wife‚Äôs ancestors being deported for crimes to feed their family wasn‚Äôt about power. Friends in Africa being murdered for being the wrong colour wasn‚Äôt racism &amp; friends committing suicide is fine huh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dhinycascyn @scottjelfs @antanddec @AshleyBanjo Ok so let‚Äôs have #BGT showing open heart surgery, a person being talked out of suicide, a cancer patient getting chemotherapy? Be appropriate with how the message is given. Otherwise you just alienate the silent majority<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scottjelfs @dhinycascyn @antanddec @AshleyBanjo Thank you. That‚Äôs exactly my point. I‚Äôm in favour of the point but ramming it down people‚Äôs throat kills the message not reinforces it. Look at #ExtinctionRebellion today. Denying people access to the press which generally supports climate change<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dhinycascyn @antanddec @AshleyBanjo Again someone assumes white privilege. I‚Äôve been abused for my sexuality &amp; age. I‚Äôve never abused anyone &amp; forcing my opinions on others just seeking to escape from the tragedy of life isn‚Äôt that bad? Tonight a 40 yr@old woman we knew committed suicidal as she couldn‚Äôt cope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dumblevel1000 @antanddec @AshleyBanjo Agreed but colour doesn‚Äôt matter we are all humans and shouldn‚Äôt abuse others whether that‚Äôs white cops killing blacks in America, blacks killing whites in Zimbabwe, Asians raping white girls in the U.K. or gangs killing gangs of any race, creed or colour anywhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dhinycascyn @antanddec @AshleyBanjo Have you read your own tweet? Could you get much more political than those two topics? They are both extremely serious and need tackling properly not being shoved into a light entertainment programme!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RioJohnero @channel5_tv @BorisJohnson I was distracted by something for some reason lol. Quite correct it was @channel4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blairs2blame We said the same where‚Äôs the #PampasGrass lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #swingers on @channel5_tv and just wondering @BorisJohnson are shields or masks compulsory? üòúü§£ü§£ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itv @itvstudios there is a website you need to see  https://t.co/rKYwHIprQm it‚Äôs @IMDb, you‚Äôll find a list of thousands of films other than #HarryPotter #JamesBond &amp; #LordOfTheRings that you could show on #SaturdayNightTV. You‚Äôll be amazed that there are so many other good films<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VaxUK Your adverts with the VOs asking each other @WhatDoesThatMean are so annoying. Please stop showing them they actually put me off your products<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VaxUK please please please stop showing your #WhatDoesThatMean adverts. I keep muting the TV or even changing channels as it‚Äôs so annoying. So your #VO people really not understand what they are selling so they have to keep asking? #WorldsWorstAdvert<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SaffronKim The humour was so forced with contrived situations that are so unrealistic, like smoking in a food factory, I forced myself to give the first episode a chance but then deleted the series link.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andipeters @lorraine @ITV They should make you the new presenter full time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watching episode 1 of #Mandy and it‚Äôs everything that‚Äôs bad about contrived comedy. How on earth did this get #commissioned by @BBCTwo? #drivel #unfunny someone smoking in a banana factory is neither funny nor is it a situation that would happen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JamesBond   #RogerMoore @PierceBrosnan  #danielcraig #seanconnery #georgelazenby #timothydalton What‚Äôs your #JamesBond order of best to worst?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RupertStreetBar missing you guys so much. Can‚Äôt wait to get back down there guys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Lorraine with @andipeters is brilliant. It‚Äôs like a modern new daytime show. He‚Äôs a star and way better than than the normal host. Keep him please permanently #lorraineAndi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alieshamatharu And the constant #WhatDoesThatMean drives me crazy. I switch off the sound as soon as a @VaxUK advert starts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andipeters @GMB Seriously you‚Äôre either an alien and in your world you age half as fast as humans or you are #DorianGrey<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Anyone else think the #WeatherForecast is like a @BorisJohnson guideline? It‚Äôll rain, it‚Äôs a #heatwave, no it‚Äôs a depression, no it‚Äôs hotter than Hawaii, expect snow/rain/sunshine/hail/heatstroke @metoffice you can‚Äôt predict the next hour anymore never mind tomorrow or next week<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkLeDeces ü§£ü§£ü§£ don‚Äôt worry not seeing him is the best way to spend 2 hours and 4 minutes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AVForums I can‚Äôt think of many films I would least like to watch again than #TheInvisibleMan so I‚Äôll pass on the chance to win a copy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@treacl Or a believable ending. She calls 911 then walks away from the crime scene. Instantly making her prime suspect and sure to be going down. Ruined the entire film<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheInvisibleMan starts slow and boring gets exciting just after the halfway mark and then has the stupidest ending ever 5/10 at the most<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #TheOldGuard on @NetflixUK and it‚Äôs brilliant @JeremyClarkson fast action good story and @CharlizeAfrica is superb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rubenwhitter Of course<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SussexOrnothing There is racism, sexism and bigotry of all sorts in every single country on this planet unfortunately. Try being gay in Dubai, black in Texas, white in Johannesburg, free speech campaigners in Hong Kong it‚Äôs everywhere. We need to stop finding bigotry and start highlighting love<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrshobbs58 @LionelMedia @KensingtonRoyal Let‚Äôs not forget his status comes from being born into a family that made all Americans subservient as well as the poor in the UK and much of the rest of the world. I support the Queen because she is about now. He is apologising for history that gave him what he‚Äôs got #hypocrite<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So a man whose entire wealth, position &amp; status is built on the oppression of the poor of all races, creeds &amp; demoninations  for all history lectures the world on race. @PHarry_Meghan give up your money to #AntiRacism charities then &amp; stop being a #woke #hypocrite #PrinceHarry<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@reallorraine why aren‚Äôt you asking @GloriaAllred why should we send #princeAndrew to the US when the #HarryDunn family can‚Äôt have the US Diplomat #AnneSacoolas sent to the UK. #WorksBothWays #RulesForOne<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @GMB That is a blatant lie. I listened to your discussion with #nigelfarage and he said he agreed with the ‚Äúdemocratic decision‚Äù in Germany to remove statues of Hitler. I saw him repeatedly avoid letting you put your words in his mouth. Stop twisting things to suit your view<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watching #NormalPeople and am I the only one confused by all the hype about this dull #BoyMeetsGirl #BoyLosesGirl #BoyFindsGirl dirge?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tessa_dunlop @JeremyVineOn5 @StormHuntley @DrSarahJarvis So sorry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikeyscotland That looks like winning to me üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbenton100 Damn I could have sworn that was you from 20 years ago. I‚Äôm going to have to watch it again now on slow mo üòÜ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbenton100 did I just spot you outside the Rialto on #BillyElliot ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamieJukes4 @PatrickWMcB @markbenton100 Only because they frustrate me. I would never claim to be perfect but I hate those who spout one train of thought but in reality act in a different way, like Lorraine Kelly, Dominic Cummings etc. I just wish people could be honest and love each other without pretending<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching @1jamiebell on @BBCOne in #BillyElliot and such a fabulous story but also such fantastic acting by him @JulieWaltersDBE and the rest of the cast including #StuartWells<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamieJukes4 one of my pleasures in life is to support young talent like you and @PatrickWMcB oh and old fogies like me such as @markbenton100 tbh talent in any form so hold your head high and be proud of the man you are, the talent you have and the love and happiness you give<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darrenchilcott1 @JamieJukes4 @FirstDates Well said<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamieJukes4 I was going to say that‚Äôs some lockdown hair but I got distracted by the rest of the picture üòâ. What a sexy man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamieJukes4 Jamie you were wonderful and he rejected a lovely man in you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamieJukes4 @FirstDates Please DM me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamieJukes4 @FirstDates Well you shouldn‚Äôt be you seem like a really lovely guy. I‚Äôm an old fart brought up in an era where not straight means we have no confidence nor ability to be true to ourselves. Be proud Jamie &amp; be confident you are such a lovely and good looking man. I‚Äôd give anything to be you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamieJukes4 @fredsirieix1 Absolutely does not apply to you Jamie, it‚Äôs the macho muscle guys and the ladies in their 20s but full of botox. They are so nice they shouldn‚Äôt be so fake<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamieJukes4 @FirstDates Wow I thought you were confident and hot. I feel inadequate by comparison lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamieJukes4 @joebrowns How about to our wedding? üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamieJukes4 @fredsirieix1 Jamie I was watching the episode before yours &amp; actually your episode was more like it used to be. I‚Äôm not flirting üòâ well maybe a bit, but it was starting to feel like If you‚Äôre over 35 or not macho or full of botox you‚Äôd never get on. A shame he said no, I thought you are fab<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Catching up on #firstdateshotel which I used to love as it had such a variety of people but it‚Äôs mainly #vacuous #airheads and #LoveIslandRejects nowadays. It‚Äôs going down the same route as #CoachTrip which is painful to watch too. @fredsirieix1 just about keeping it going<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattHancock How out of touch are you? Do you really think horse racing is such a high priority for most of the population with the third highest death rate in the world? What‚Äôs next in your list orgies of up to 20 people allowed before a family of 10 can meet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OliverDowden are you utterly stupid or are you like so many politicians and incapable of answering a straight question? She never asked the importance of #TrackAndTrace she asked why there were different solutions for each country making up the #UK #coronvirusbriefing #ffs<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EamonnHolmes You and @RuthieeL should be the main presenters of #ThisMorning you bring happiness and fun to articles without being childish whilst talking serious issues head on.

<|startoftext|>@susannareid100 @maitlis Seems like she used her natural instincts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanPostsAwesome @shakbonee @odogg9 @susannareid100 @maitlis Like we can‚Äôt have one rule to #StayAtHome if any member of your house has symptoms of #Coronavirus &amp; another that says if you‚Äôre a #GovernmentAdvisor or friend of @BorisJohnson you can do whatever you want, even driving a car with impaired vision which is illegal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patrick1386 @JohnMcM49843250 @tristanjamesact @Sara_Rose_G Fridge Over Troubled Waters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sara_Rose_G So many people have forgotten what they were taught at school to read the question properly. Loved your parody of him risking OUR lives to protect HIS family<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @Peston what a contrast of leadership between the Netherlands and our UK ‚Äúleaders‚Äù @BorisJohnson &amp; #DominicCummings. One you would follow anything he asked &amp; the other you‚Äôd say why should we. #LeadingByExample #covid19 #coronavirusUK    https://t.co/YPTMacrcr7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peston @bbclaurak is the media being gagged for the #CoronaVirusUpdate? There was a distinct absence of questions about #DominicCummings today. Have we become a #dictatorship?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson More relevant slogans would be ‚Äúdo as we say and not as we do because we are your superiors‚Äù and ‚Äúof course we can fine you for doing what we do‚Äù<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson Ok on one condition. Can you tell us the #CummingsExceptions now instead of us minions following the rules and only hearing about them after they get rolled out to excuse his breaching of the rules?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @HerFaithness I also would love a wealthy backer to support one of the people fined for selling childcare seek an appeal through the courts which of course would then give the country a judicial review on this. @RobertJenrick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertJenrick confirms #TheNastyParty is back with different rules for them to us with no review of fines for others seeking #childcare needs under #Covid19 #CummingsMustGo. After 20yrs of voting conservative @Keir_Starmer will be getting my vote from now on. @WalkerWorcester<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WalkerWorcester I‚Äôm a constituent who voted for you so why is #DominicCummings allowed to leave home when someone has #Covid19 symptoms against #StayAtHome laws when he has family in London. Why is it deemed ok to drive a car 1 hour round trip to test eyesight problems?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joymorrissey I‚Äôm a conservative voting #brexiteer and totally disagree so come on then explain why me and others like me are pissed off with #DominicCummings getting privileged treatment when he broke the #StayAtHome message and worse broke driving laws by driving with impaired vision.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love it<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@richard_price2 Happy birthday Richard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CatharineHoey @MattHancock @Peston It was rude &amp; not the behaviour I want from a senior MP &amp; Secretary of State.

<|startoftext|>@MariaCarletonYT Another #GovernmentAdvisor who doesn‚Äôt seem to understand reality. Is it any wonder the #ScientificAdvice they‚Äôve been following has given us the second worst deaths globally<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DailyBriefinguk @MattHancock asked  ‚ÄúWill you review fines imposed on families travelling for childcare?‚Äù  His reply ‚ÄúI need to refer that to my finance colleagues‚Äù. So arbitrary application of rules to exclude #SpecialAdvisors is about finance &amp; not #Fairness. Hello #NastyParty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peston @MattHancock And boy was he annoyed at you daring to ask the difference between him and #Cummings. They really don‚Äôt understand the public wrath on this #SpecialRulesForSpecialAdvisors #ThemAndUs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson whether you truly believe or not that #DominicCummings did not break the #CoronavirusLockdown you must realise #TheNeedsOfTheManyOutweighTheNeedsOfTheFew  To keep #publicsupport you need #publictrust &amp; you‚Äôre losing both  https://t.co/gkLXEooK9W  https://t.co/LSER3GGGhv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RishiSunak #DominicCummings took days to craft a tickbox story to ‚Äúexplain‚Äù why he broke #CoronavirusLaws. But some like the #EyesightDrive are beyond belief. If you are willing to shred your reputation along with other colleagues who are supporting him then we will remember next election<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWMcB What a lovely memory for you. I‚Äôm older than you but memories with grandparents are so special. Mine was my granddad making matchstick models of churches where we lived<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afneil @piersmorgan In order to ensure there was no #AbuseOfPowerInAPublicOffice I think @DurhamPolice need to track his mobile phone movements and investigate properly. Surely #DominicCummings and @BorisJohnson would welcome this to prove the nasty journalists wrong wouldn‚Äôt they?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afneil Why are none of the journalists really going for him? His story has more holes than a slice of Emmental. Even @Peston was lightweight with his questions.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@laneylu @BorisJohnson Because you‚Äôre not applying #CummingsSense. @BorisJohnson just said #DominicCummings did the right thing applying the logic of any parent. So apply the same logic and see your grandkids it‚Äôs logical for #PositiveMentalHealth #lockdownover<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@turtle2401791 @kevintablet13 @ITV @BBC @BradleyWalsh @MarkLabbett Well said<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@fixautodagenham @ITV Yeah loved the personalities of most but did you notice those who were on other quizzes like #thechase before, i.e. the professional quizzers, were generally so duller than the newbies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I absolutely loved #BeatTheChasers until yet again all the same contestants from #TheChase and other #TVQuizzes #fix #boring @itv @bbc thanks but if you can‚Äôt give others a chance then #ImOut @BradleyWalsh @MarkLabbett<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@robin101962 @beyonddispute Total fix<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Paultvfan2020 Feels like an @itv fix like #WhoWantsToBeAMillionaire all over again. Do they never learn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How come #BeatTheChasers have had contestants from #thechase? So many applied including me and failed. It feels like a #CoughCough fix all over again #WhoWantsToBeAMillionaire @itv #disappointed<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#KateandKoji with @BrendaBlethyn was like a 1970s sitcom. Tacky set, limited character development &amp; stilted script with little flow. I blooming loved it.

<|startoftext|>@Lost_In_Films_ I‚Äôm just bored<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#thetroublewithmaggiecole is that it‚Äôs a weak, one hour comedy drama based on a flawed &amp; illegal premise of a journalist getting someone drunk and broadcasting it being dragged out into a lumbering, dull series.

<|startoftext|>@Richwhitty63 I would they looked clearly like they were lying<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SFinneranTV @SFinneranTV the cast and acting is superb. The script and the background is so intense and it‚Äôs well written. It‚Äôs just the camera work which makes it really nauseating to watch. Too many short zooms, quick refocusing and jerky movements<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CopleyHill @TheFabledAesop @JaneAustenHouse If you read the write up on it, I think the Independent and Radio Times interviewed the producers who said the chose Brean and Weston as the nearest to what they wanted and then used CGI to create the town look.

<|startoftext|>#HacksawRidge on @channel5_tv is the best but also the most moving #WarFilm ever made @andrewgarfield is incredible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaneAustenHouse The worst CGI I‚Äôve seen on a programme for 20 years, the most predictable script ever and so many period items in the wrong period.

<|startoftext|>Episode 1 of #Sanditon and for me it‚Äôs a great cast, poor #CGI and meh script. All twee, stilted, moody men, swooning women and predictable exactly as you‚Äôd expect from a #JaneAusten or #BronteSisters story. Definitely no #DowntonAbbey<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>To my followers I am so sorry for my recent tweets.

<|startoftext|>@iboz75 @BallySev @danwootton @TheSun @BallySev you‚Äôre even sadder in many ways<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iboz75 @BallySev @danwootton @TheSun And that‚Äôs why you are sick. I HAVE BEEN ABUSED. I said his behaviour was inappropriate but so was @danwootton and @TheSun making claims legal investigations have been unable to prove but you crossed the line sicko<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iboz75 @BallySev @danwootton @TheSun Yeah course you would. You sickened me with your last claim. Piss off you‚Äôve actually sickened me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iboz75 @BallySev @danwootton @TheSun Don‚Äôt pull the survivor of abuse crap I was abused as a child by a sick old man so fuck off. MJ behaves in a way with young boys that was not right if you want to blindly deny everyywell good on you but don‚Äôt expect others to think men sleeping with boys as fucking normal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iboz75 @BallySev @danwootton @TheSun And that is inappropriate behaviour an adult simple<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iboz75 @BallySev @danwootton @TheSun You should be careful with your ‚Äúevidence‚Äù. The defense that LaToya was influenced by a controlling male could be used as the same argument about young boys being influenced by a controlling male adult &amp; only able to tell the truth now they are free of him. #doublestandards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iboz75 @BallySev @danwootton @TheSun If you are talking to me can I ask you on where have I said he is a paedo? I‚Äôve been very clear I believe his behaviour with very young boys was inappropriate but I have not seen any legal evidence proving it was more than that. Move on now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iboz75 @BallySev @danwootton @TheSun LaToya isn‚Äôt the only one in the family who spoke out about MJ &amp; the sleepovers not being right. As I said before your moral compass is different to mine.   I‚Äôm not saying it makes him a paedo I‚Äôm just saying again that his behaviour with young boys was inappropriate for a man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BallySev @danwootton @TheSun And I also said there is no evidence &amp; I disagree with Wootton and the sun calling him a peadophile. Why are you trolling someone who agrees with you on that? I just said I believe a man sleeping with young boys is inappropriate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BallySev @danwootton @TheSun U clearly do have probs distinguishing. What are you on about @danwootton &amp; @TheSun defending your responses. U clearly have a very different moral compass to me so let‚Äôs just agree to disagree about MJ &amp; agree Mr Wotton &amp; Sun have just republished the stories of people who lie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iboz75 @BallySev @danwootton @TheSun Staying in bed with the young children of other people is not appropriate and as for being explained no it has not ‚Äúbeen explained‚Äù under no circumstance is that appropriate. Members of his own family have questioned it publicly and said they told him it isn‚Äôt right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BallySev @danwootton @TheSun And why are you raising @danwootton to defend your response when my posts have already slated him as being as biased against him as you are for him? #JustAsBiased<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BallySev @danwootton @TheSun And you are so blinkered you can‚Äôt distinguish admitted behaviour from acceptable behaviour. Would you be happy for a man in his thirties, forties or fifties to want to sleep in a bed with your 11 year old son no matter how big the bed was? And even more without you there too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iboz75 @BallySev @danwootton @TheSun Yes that there is no evidence he committed a criminal act but not that how he behaved was inappropriate. Do you really find it so hard to distinguish between the two?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BallySev @danwootton @TheSun I‚Äôm sorry but would you really be happy with a 35 year old or older man sleeping with pre-pubescent children? Its not like he is hard up and it was a family holiday. I certainly think it is inappropriate and find it hard to believe anyone else would find that normal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iboz75 @BallySev @danwootton @TheSun Because MJ himself admitted he slept in the same bed as young boys. Don‚Äôt you think that is inappropriate? However that doesn‚Äôt make him guilty of being a peadophile and all police and FBI investors failed to find any evidence so innocent until proven guilty with actual evidence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danwootton @TheSun If you have the evidence then hand it to the authorities like happened with #Saville. But if you‚Äôre just regurgitating ‚Äúevidence‚Äù from people who keep changing their stories to make money then you should be ashamed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danwootton That‚Äôs very hypocritical of you and @TheSun considering you are doing the same. The documentary is biased, it is based on 2 proven liars, either then or now. I believe MJ was totally inappropriate with kids but all the investigators &amp; court case could find any evidence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danwootton @TheSun I look forward to your new evidence which even the FBI and the courts couldn‚Äôt find. I am very uncomfortable with how #MichaelJackson was with boys but when it comes to publishing the truth?  https://t.co/gRckT0Pimk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danwootton @TheSun @coconutprince as a victim of #childabuse Dan from their historic court evidence we know the #MJaccusers are unreliable witnesses &amp; their parents and #MJ behaved questionably so why not write and support @Corey_Feldman instead to imprison living #peadophiles in the industry?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Is @itv #TalentBooker the 2nd laziest person in TV after their #FilmScheduler? The same acts on #JRossShow as other #ITVDaytime shows, e.g. @joshgroban or they book #ITV‚Äôs own ‚Äútalent‚Äù #keithlemon how long before @wossy @piersmorgan @Schofe @reallorraine interview themselves?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see @itv‚Äôs teenage #film scheduler has struck again for #SaturdayNights.  Folks check out @IMDb cos there are more films than just #HarryPotter #LordOfTheRings &amp; #TheHobbit #GiveUsABreak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No offence but I just don‚Äôt get #NoOffence the acting is fine but the script is puerile, childish and totally unbelievable. Is it a comedic drama, a satirical cop show or just an awful mix of both<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#wtf #CelebrityMasterchef and #GemmaCollins has someone helping peeling potatoes #fix. Why do #TvProducers book her?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Roantowers And hers was mental abuse which is just as bad. I‚Äôve known people who have been destroyed by similar false allegations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Roantowers One can only hope that people realise #Roxanne is as guilty of abuse as the likes of #KevinSpacey and the impact that will have on viewer numbers and revenue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Roantowers She‚Äôs so toxic I don‚Äôt think producers of those shows would take the risk of her making false allegations and even z-listers wouldn‚Äôt want the risk of being in her company. I‚Äôm no celebrity but I wouldn‚Äôt work with her #Roxanne #CBBUK #CBBRoxanne<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbbots_uk I believed every word said during the interview. @emmawillis was totally honest! Oh U mean #Roxanne? Well she was honestly sorry her career has ended, sorry she got caught, sorry she forget about the cameras. Making false #domesticviolence claims against someone is #domesticabuse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samattwater @RealDeniseWelch well the good news is #Roxannecbb #roxanne is not the good actress she thought. Against the feeble questions from @theJeremyVine she was unconvincing but @EmmaWillis really made her squirm and took no garbage. Her career has to be over #CBBUK #CBBRoxanne<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Roxanne using words like #sensitive #overreacting &amp; #mistake when she should be admitting wanting to #destroy #lying #domesticabuser #liar #bully<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmmaWillis should take over our #Brexit negotiations! #cbbuk #roxanne  https://t.co/iUWeRuFPdX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmmaWillis wow hats off to you for doing what @theJeremyVine failed miserably #perfectinterviewer. The look of contempt in your eyes as you saw through her lies and that ending was exactly what she deserved. #CouldYouForgiveYourself then the end #RoxannePalett<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeremyVineOn5 @theJeremyVine @bbuk #Roxannecbb language translator  "I wasn't thinking straight‚Äù - I should have remembered all the cameras around.  ‚ÄúI need to become a better person." - I need to be more vigilant to make sure next time I don‚Äôt make such silly mistakes so they can‚Äôt prove I‚Äôm lying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jsynikki @JeremyVineOn5 @theJeremyVine @bbuk I totally agree with you Nicola. I‚Äôm also a #DVSurvivor and yes I‚Äôm male and it was a women doing the abusing. #Roxanne‚Äôs MO in the house and the way she behaved during the interview brought back horrible memories. She should not have been given this airtime or treated so lightly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@channel5_tv @JeremyVineOn5 I watched the interview and what I heard was her apologising for saying ‚Äúdeliberately‚Äù I didn‚Äôt hear an apology about claiming it was repeatedly. She also said she got it wrong this time so how many more times has she done the same sort of thing? #bully #DomesticViolence #false<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@K3llyElizabeth @camilleri1864 @JeremyVineOn5 @theJeremyVine She claimed to be sensitive and that‚Äôs why she overreacted and yet not a tear about the fact that she now realised if it were not for the cameras she would have destroyed a fellow actor‚Äôs career and potentially life. #false #SelfAbsorbed and #dangerous to anyone around her<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeremyVineOn5 @theJeremyVine I think she is sorry she got caught and sorry she forgot you can‚Äôt lie with 24/7 cameras around.  I think it will be hard for anyone  to work with her in the future as she has proved herself to be a polished liar and a manipulator willing to make any malicious claim.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fluffymunchkin1 @6654aedebaab4a9 @superTV247 @JeremyVineOn5 @theJeremyVine @channel5_tv @ryanjamesthomas We are clearly not going to agree so there is no point in continuing to debate. I believe what she did was morally wrong and criminal and age should not be rewarded. You believe what she did was an error and nobody should express their views if critical.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fluffymunchkin1 @6654aedebaab4a9 @superTV247 @JeremyVineOn5 @theJeremyVine @channel5_tv @ryanjamesthomas Sexual predator no, but someone who uses #domesticviolence as a way to get what she wants yes. Calling for a boycott of shows which pay her and give her airtime for behaving like that is called a protest. Funnily enough we even have laws banning people benefitting from crime.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fluffymunchkin1 @6654aedebaab4a9 @superTV247 @JeremyVineOn5 @theJeremyVine @channel5_tv @ryanjamesthomas And also for clarity I have not nor have other tweets I‚Äôve commented on bullied her. The tweets are about what this woman has done and how we do not believe she should be rewarded by being given airtime and money for her abusive actions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fluffymunchkin1 @superTV247 @JeremyVineOn5 @theJeremyVine @channel5_tv Actually some have said that she ruined their lives for years<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fluffymunchkin1 @6654aedebaab4a9 @superTV247 @JeremyVineOn5 @theJeremyVine @channel5_tv Let‚Äôs be totally honest here she has lied and used mental cruelty on another person in order to try to make gains for herself. She has committed #DomesticAbuse and you call that an error? Would you be defending @ryanjamesthomas in the same way if he had hit her like she claimed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fluffymunchkin1 @superTV247 @JeremyVineOn5 @theJeremyVine @channel5_tv My point is she has a clear track record and it‚Äôs lucky she has been caught out this time but she has previously done it to others not so lucky to have 24/7 cameras<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@6654aedebaab4a9 @Fluffymunchkin1 @superTV247 @JeremyVineOn5 @theJeremyVine @channel5_tv Well said. What #roxannepallett did was not a mistake it was a cold and calculated move to try to win support and not give a damn about the victim‚Äôs life she would have destroyed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fluffymunchkin1 @superTV247 @JeremyVineOn5 @theJeremyVine @channel5_tv I abhor abusers and lying accusers with equal vigour. You clearly are a wet liberal and should be ashamed of not seeing both sides<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fluffymunchkin1 @superTV247 @JeremyVineOn5 @theJeremyVine @channel5_tv You‚Äôve clearly lived a lucky life where this hasn‚Äôt happened to anyone you know. If you had you would understand how liars like her destroy innocent men and women and destroy is not an overstatement<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fluffymunchkin1 @superTV247 @JeremyVineOn5 @theJeremyVine @channel5_tv Sorry mate but if you are accused of #domesticabuse in real life you end up with a police investigation which could drag on months or years you will be suspended from work or even sacked which means no income, home lost, family gone and pushed to the brink of suicide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@loopielou_ I agree with you 100%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fluffymunchkin1 @superTV247 @JeremyVineOn5 @theJeremyVine @channel5_tv are you saying it is ok to mentally or physically abuse someone without consequences?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fluffymunchkin1 @superTV247 @JeremyVineOn5 @theJeremyVine @channel5_tv No I‚Äôm saying she should no longer be given air time. If you messed up totally at work or abused someone you would be sacked and could face prison. She has done the same and as such should no longer be employed by her employers i.e. TV companies and have to find a new career<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheIsland @Channel4 why are you keeping #RoxannePallett in the trailers? Should be ashamed to promote an abuser of #domesticviolence @BearGrylls your own reputation is being tarnished associated with her too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fluffymunchkin1 @superTV247 @JeremyVineOn5 @theJeremyVine @channel5_tv Sorry buddy but making mistakes is one thing but when was it ever right to try to totally destroy someone with lies to the point they might consider suicide? Because those sort of lies have done that<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mansbrain @JeremyVineOn5 @theJeremyVine @channel5_tv I thought the same but I won‚Äôt watch and if she is on I‚Äôll never watch again. Supporting the abuse of #domesticviolence #domesticabuse for personal gain is as bad as doing it. #goodbye<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dan9700 @JeremyVineOn5 @theJeremyVine @channel5_tv I hope the ratings are zero<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kim_hoyle @JeremyVineOn5 @theJeremyVine @channel5_tv Just a thought but why not drop her and have that decent guy called @Rylan on instead #boycottpallet #boycottroxanne<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertWSaunders @JeremyVineOn5 @channel5_tv @theJeremyVine So you support #lies #falseaccusations, allowing scum to destroy #innocentpeople and you‚Äôll pay them too. Wow so now we know your programme is one not worth watching congrats #DeadInTheWater<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simosweets @JeremyVineOn5 @theJeremyVine @channel5_tv Couldn‚Äôt agree more. How to kill a show at birth put someone on who thinks it‚Äôs ok to lie and try to destroy someone with lies and demean #domesticviolence to prosper your own career I hope @StormHuntley refuses to appear on principle cos she is such a nice person<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JeremyVineOn5 @theJeremyVine @channel5_tv Are you f***ing kidding? If you can give airtime and one penny to someone who uses #domesticabuse #domesticviolence as a game then good luck but I will never watch another episode and bring back @Matthew_Wright @5wrightstuff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@superTV247 @JeremyVineOn5 if you give that vile abuser of #domesticabuse one penny and one second of time I will never watch again and I call on everyone to boycott the show until you leave @theJeremyVine #BlacklistPallet @channel5_tv #domesticviolence is not a game play<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnJamesDuffy @adamthomas21 @Ofcom @channel5_tv @Celebrity_BB Not so sure. They had access to the video proof before taking any action.

<|startoftext|>Disgusted that some #TVProducers think this abuse of #domesticabuse and #mentalcruelty is acceptable. Get @ryanjamesthomas in the #Diaryroom and tell him the truth and show the others the video proof or we all switch off @Celebrity_BB @channel5_tv<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnJamesDuffy @loosewomen @thismorning @reallorraine @GMB And men who have been abused by women<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rylan Totally agree. For @channel5_tv @Celebrity_BB not to show it should be reported to @Ofcom as #MentalCruelty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnJamesDuffy TBH if @loosewomen @thismorning @reallorraine or @GMB give her air time I‚Äôll stop watching them too. I‚Äôm a big supporter of #BatteredWives, #AbusedHusbands and #domesticAbuse so giving a #liar like her airtime knowing the damage her lies can create like #suicide would be too much<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TeeCee40 @TeamEveMyles @BBCOne I agree every award.

<|startoftext|>@BBCOne No but thank god we can use our off switch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MasterChefUK @BBCOne I‚Äôd guess if I recognised any of them apart from Anita Harris and Carole Decker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCOne @CherylOfficial @OtiMabuse @Matt_Morrison @GreatDancerTV Thanks for the warning I now know to avoid it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun Star? On what planet they are almost all nobodies. No wonder the BBC use the Strictly title because if they called it #DancingWithTheStars they‚Äôd be sued for false advertising #StrictlyComeDancing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCOne @MasterChefUK @Aj11Ace @caroldecker @chizzyakudolu @claraamfo @FrankieBridge @Jay_n_Co @mustbejp @JoshUJWorld Well with Gemma Collins on there I won‚Äôt be watching this series. Why are #TVexecs so obsessed by her?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok so those are the contestants for the public #Masterchef but when will you announce who the celebrities are? #celebrityMasterchef @GreggAWallace @JohnTorode1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeamEveMyles can you please remind me what is the plot to #KeepingFaith because I‚Äôve forgotten even though I‚Äôm watching it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just realised why I‚Äôve gone from liking #KeepingFaith to being bored with it. I‚Äôm no longer watching a drama but watching actors delivering their lines @TeamEveMyles #soslow #overacted #dullproduction #poordirection #weakstoryline #paddedscenes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#KeepingFaith and 25mins in it‚Äôs gone all arty and padded dentist scenes adding nothing to the plot. Why not put a scene of her drinking water or maybe cleaning her teeth or tying shoelaces too @TeamEveMyles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How to kill a show #KeepingFaith  Take a great plot and fab cast. Fill it with meaningless padded scenes and then put a #SoundEditor in charge so you have to vary your TV volume from 32 to 82 to follow the plot. Thanks @BBCOne #mumblegate strikes again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SharonM6327 Series 1 &amp; 2 on Netflix and 3 on BBC iplayer its raunchy but the plot being based on history is so good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SharonM6327 Thinking about it I‚Äôd say now #Versailles has finished the best drama on TV is currently #Unforgotten<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SharonM6327 Yeah although #KeepingFaith is being dragged out with too much artistic #padding to make it a longer series<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#OurShirleyValentineSummer on @itv now actually looking forward to it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I‚Äôm afraid #birdsofafeather is one totally plucked bird. Dated humour and #cannedlaughter on almost every line<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SharonM6327 Loving #KeepingFaith and #Versailles was stunning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AgeBeforeBeauty is like the sick lovechild of #KeepingUpWithTheKardashians and #Shamless. Such a waste of a great cast of actors @BBCOne<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SharonM6327 I watched the first episode because of how strong the cast was but the script is bloody awful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just seen #SaturdayNight‚Äôs big film on @ITV. Is the head of scheduling aware there are more films than #HarryPotter #LordOfTheRings &amp; #TheHobbit? #boring #giveusabreak #predictable<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SuitedScouser17 @Gingermommmy @GMB The fact that Dubai is more westernised is exactly why I chose it. Even there they restrict who can wear what and where and not just for women.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gingermommmy @GMB Wow so women are dictated too about what they can wear and a clear intolerance for transvestites<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gingermommmy @GMB So would it be ok for a non-Muslim to walk around Dubai in a bikini? Openness, sexism and religious compassion works both ways<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB why not run a #twitterpoll? Should Britain #BanTheBurka  and similar head and face coverings be banned?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mwjb1980 I‚Äôve seen less padding on a #PantomineDame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCTwo has #Versailles finished? Such a good series but it feels like you‚Äôve treated it with contempt. Will there be another series and when will we see it? #fabTV s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear @ITVDaytimeUK @itv please accept this as my intention to resign from watching #DaytimeTV on #ITV due to your endless stream of #IntellectuallyStunted #RealityShow contestants.

<|startoftext|>#KeepingFaith getting so dragged out and pointless. So now he owes some gangland thugs ¬£80k.

<|startoftext|>@TheTVGrump And they both deserve to stay hidden<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dianebaker01 I just don‚Äôt get it. Some say it‚Äôs a mainly female crew and cast and depending on where you sit on that argument it means it should be good or inevitably bad. But for me it‚Äôs just slow and going nowhere. Each scene feels like padding to make it several episodes long. #dull<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CelebJuice @lemontwittor Why so I can see pretend #blowjobs with carrots. Pretend #lesbian #kissing using an egg? If I want to watch porn and be aroused I look at one of the many websites to my taste. I watch TV to be amused and entertained not to see #mockporn<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Peter_Wilkins78 Where is your ‚Äúinfer‚Äù in ‚ÄúNot sure you understand as other than yours, every other comment on TG tonight is positive. And given that loads of people automatically dismiss it cos it's not CHM presenting means it must have been good.‚Äù<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_Wilkins78 I never inferred about the quantity of positive or negative reviews either I just gave my opinion of it being a car crash episode.

<|startoftext|>@Peter_Wilkins78 I never said in my original tweet that there were or were not positive tweets so maybe you need to consider your tweets more carefully when it comes to consistency &amp; accuracy.

<|startoftext|>@Peter_Wilkins78 Hmm that‚Äôs an interesting but inaccurate view. There are a lot of positive views but also plenty of negative ones.

<|startoftext|>Looking forward to this week‚Äôs helping of #ShakespeareAndHathaway with @markbenton100 @dollyjoyner &amp; the #SceneStealer extraordinaire @PatrickWMcB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TopGear is now so good! Well erm #MaybeNot @BBC_TopGear  https://t.co/FVPjKrbI3R<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xoNicolaxox Me too especially if it‚Äôs on @BBCFOUR on a Tuesday morning #AllTogetherNow #trashTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great news #AllTogetherNow finished tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhoPotterVian @antanddec Not only appeared but reckon they would have enjoyed being on it too. I feel humble saying it but for me the three #greatest double acts of all time are in order #LaurelAndHardy #MorecambeAndWise then @antanddec. But the exciting thing is number 3 are with us &amp; can still improve<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@antanddec you guys smashed #SaturdayNightTakeaway #SNT congrats on 100 episodes &amp; looking forward to the next 100. #MorecambeAndWise would be proud. #LongLive the #DoubleAct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheVoiceUK so good tonight. I love the way the coaches are supportive @ollyofficial @iamwill @IAMJHUD @RealSirTomJones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickWMcB really is stealing the show on #ShakespeareAndHathaway. #FabShow #GreatScript #SuperbCast and well erm #ManCrush hope he messages lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just catching up on today‚Äôs #ShakespeareAndHathaway and @PatrickWMcB so good and cute too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If @itv really have axed #Benidorm because of only 4.3m viewers maybe it‚Äôs coz they‚Äôve put it on in a crap #midweek slot. But they‚Äôre still pumping out #craptv on @ITVBe with viewers of a few thousand<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Loving @PatrickWMcB in #ShakespeareAndHathaway #StealingTheShow<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ingerdilly This one is definitely a repeat I remember the concrete table as my wife wanted one after seeing it last time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#itv proving once again they are the #TVChannel of repeats #LoveYourGarden #Primetime Friday night come on @itv #MustTryHarder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LancashirePR @ingham_tabitha Yep that‚Äôs exactly the same with us. Adverts too loud programme voices too quiet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AaronDelays @annafriel Great script, great cast a #recap to get us up to speed would have been good but #wherethehell di you get the #soundeditor? #mumblingvoices<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Loving #Marcella but why do I listen to the adverts at #SoundLevel 22 but Marcella at level 74? #MumbleGate #diresound #SackTheSoundman<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyBMiller @Isobel_steele Incredible acting for someone of her age<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HillsFitz Yeah that was one plot weakness. The Surgeon even had to buzz himself to get out so how did the dad get in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trauma @itv at last a #fast#FastPaced drama. Superb script from #MikeBartlett and excellent performances from @JohnSimmSociety &amp; @AdrianLester #gripping<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just deleted the last theee episodes of #McMafia I value 3 hours of my life more than this boring drivel. Can‚Äôt do it anymore and don‚Äôt care about any of the characters. Sorry @jginorton but doing a #monotone #HuskyVoice isn‚Äôt #JamesBond material<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_H_Todd @ITV @BBC That‚Äôs a sad indictment of scheduler‚Äôs acceptance of mediocre. &lt;5m for prime time Saturday should be seen as failure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ITV why don‚Äôt you change your name to #RealiTV because you seem #obsessed by it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MahaliaBelo If you‚Äôre responsible for this I think you should hide not brag about it. I‚Äôve seen paint dry faster<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Requiem about as scary as a #LumpofCoal &amp; storyline makes as much sense as #ChocolateCurry.  Why would a shard of mirror be hanging from a tree. Why would mother who lost her child dismiss someone with pics of the girl and who is the right age? #BoringDross a good concept spoilt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NextOfKin only slightly more confusing than a #BriefHistoryOfTime and slightly less interesting than watching my #toenails grow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay I‚Äôve sussed the plots at last. The terrorist cell in #NextOfKin is funded by #McMafia but the top boss is actually #KIRI who has come back in #Requim to kill them all by causing the #HardSun. Or have I become so #BrainDead from this #BoringDrivel I‚Äôve #LostThePlot? #boring<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@laura_alice24 I think the twist will be the terrorist cell in #NextOfKin is funded by #McMafia and it all explodes into oblivion when the world ends due to the #HardSun<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wiseboy901 Yep been through East Ham and Hanger Lane so many times. Why on earth did they try to fob this off. Next it‚Äôll be running down #BlackpoolTower  and coming out at the bottom of #TheShard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GravyThanGrave #NextOfKin more like #BloodyAwful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Janieghost Stupid plot lines, weak script and direction so slow I‚Äôve seen faster snails<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DMcCSE17 @BBCOne It feels like an eternity! Such a shame #agynessdeyn has been wasted on a plot slower than the #MagicRoundabout‚Äôs Brian<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coxy1927 I‚Äôm so similar. But I‚Äôm looking forward to the final episode of #McMafia hoping something better and faster will be on the following week<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@laststraw13 I wanted to vote but you never included the off button<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@XXNat1982XX How about something with a slightly faster plot? Hmm I know #PaintDrying ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#HardSun more like #HardWatch seriously @BBCOne did nobody vet the script to see how dull it is? #agynessdeyn is superb but there are limits to what even the best talent can save<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_H_Todd Well I‚Äôve got 28 years on you so I‚Äôve had to endure the decline of TV into the reality laden dross we now endure. With @ITV constantly pushing their dreary reality shows &amp; the @BBC thinking they have to find the next #XFactor even though it‚Äôs ratings are dying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_H_Todd So what you‚Äôre basically saying is even 57 years ago when there were far fewer TVs as they cost a small fortune in relative terms the average Sunday night audience was double what the main channels can get on a Saturday night with the latest dross!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MicLDunford @claudelittner Part of the problem is too much money is wasted in administration and bean counters. Although I have lost count of the number of times I‚Äôve seen medical staff discussing bed layouts and the like<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the show with really talented coaches who make the show lively, participative, fun &amp; about talent not picking the most popular song smashes the rest in the ratings. #WhatASurprise @iamwill @ollyofficial @RealSirTomJones @IAMJHUD  https://t.co/Pwg0KJxYCz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeftySocialist Yeah it‚Äôs a shame @bbc don‚Äôt do a proper gripping drama for Saturday night instead of endless #boring #singingcontests #AllTogetherNow #AllSwitchOffNow more like<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCiPlayer The only spooky thing was Matilda‚Äôs fringe! #Requiem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@firstconcept You mean unlike the #disappointing start?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonnaMy54 Actually I think it‚Äôs 6 episodes too many. #Requiem, #HardSun #McMafia #draggedout #slow #toomoody #OverDramatised. #TalesOfTheUnexpected did more in one episode than this #drivel does in several<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCOne my mother committed #suicide I want to find out why. So I go to a place where she seemed #fixated about &amp; stay at the house #cornycoincidence &amp; what do I take? Yeah of course my #cello? #ffs #Requiem #Boring<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #Requiem gets any slower it will grind to a halt. #dull #slow it‚Äôs about as gripping as a banana covered in olive oil<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really like @JuliaBradbury but come on @itv 2.5 hours!!! This is #primetime what‚Äôs next week? #100bestpaintdryingviews, #100favouriteplacestobesick #100worstITVProgranmesEver? Hey hang on that last one could work  @ITV100Walks #britainsfavouritewalks #100walks #cheaptv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jack_T11 I can‚Äôt decide if it will become a #DoctorFoster series one with an exciting twist or a #Lost where at the end you say why did I waste my life watching it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ThroughThekeyhole @lemontwittor great show tonight. When do you start filming #LemonSwimmers? üòú<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@putthetellyon @Sulsters_inc @BBCOne @ITV But the few good dramas show if you invest in good shows you get the ratings. No wonder #Netflix &amp; #AmazonPrime et al are taking market share from the #TerrestrialTVMonopolies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DERBY5HIRE I think #WeddingDayWinners might have been due to run longer than it ended up being. Now if only I could remember which channel commissioned it and who were the presenters? #DejaVu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sulsters_inc @BBCOne &amp; @itv commissioners have lost the ability to be #edgy and #creative and keep recycling twists on the same #BoringTheme<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just to prove the point @BBCOne with yet another #singingcontest #GiveUsABreak #GarbageTV so let‚Äôs get #alltogethernow and #SwitchOff #altogethernow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watched #iBoy the best thing on TV in 2018. The sort of #grittyShow @itv &amp; @bbc used to make before they got obsessed with #RealityTV &amp; #TalentlessNobodies unlike #starcast @Maisie_Williams @Bill_Milner<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrMck @LeighFrancis sorry but you‚Äôve pushed @lemontwittor to the sick level<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@richardosman I love #pointless so much better<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ThroughTheKeyhole who are these people? More like #EstateAgents tour of homes you might like! #NonCelebrities #nobodies #Zlist @lemontwittor @itv if that‚Äôs the best the #GiveItARest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#weddingdaywinners #wdwinners @BBCOne @reallorraine  What do you think?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cheeg6 That‚Äôs my issue it‚Äôs a glaring hole in the plot. Why is #SarahLancashire‚Äôs #socialworker being investigated when #Kiri died in her #grandparents care? #confused<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The_Gazette @Channel4 What? Even though #Kiri died in the care of her grandfather and yet it‚Äôs the #SocialWorker being investigated and he‚Äôs treated liked the mourning relative? #PlotHole<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nicell70 @Channel4 But the child died under the care of the #grandparents so why isn‚Äôt it them being investigated? #weakscript<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #kiri @Channel4 &amp; plot makes no sense. She‚Äôs left with grandparents &amp; dies but #socialworker bad &amp; #granddad distraught when she died under his care #ffs #lazywriting #MakesNoSense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WDWinners thanks for making a show that made me appreciate watching paint dry! #WeddingDayWinners #TVLicenceFeeLosers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chalfy Hmm #Pointless #WeddingDay #Casualty that seems to sum it up! #WeddingDayWinners<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesdhobson Well @BBCOne have poached @reallorraine so expectations were almost as low as the show ended up being!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone else think #McMafia less #McDonalds and more #Wimpy? #dull #slow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ChristmasFood &amp; @itv are the perfect complement. No sooner have you finished either and they‚Äôre #repeating on you like crazy. #ForTheLoveOfDogs #Victoria et al #GiveUsABreak #StopInstantRepeats ever heard of #catchupTV?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TerenceLane5 @itv have made sure we get to see every film at least 5 times a year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarlislesDamage @ITV Bet @itv don‚Äôt answer because they have no imagination<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@connors_theresa Don‚Äôt worry #itv will bring it back in Feb and then Easter then summer followed by Autumn #BankHoliday then for #haloween &amp; then #Christmas2018 #GiveUsABreak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Singlemumx3 Really? I thought it was per week? Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SnotFace1986 @ITV Of course they are. The other films are called #LordOfTheRings and #TheHobbit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeHobbs2 I think they‚Äôve had a #CreativityFart<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Becky_Boo1975 @ITV Wouldn‚Äôt be as bad if they hadn‚Äôt shown the whole lot only a few months ago. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôve run out of ideas. Hence #XFactor #TheVoice #bgt #HarryPotter et al<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itv in the autumn you played back to back #HarryPotter. So #wtf are you doing giving us the series again alll over #christmas? #craptv #repeats #giveusabreak #NoCreativity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Less #Emmerdale &amp; more #EmmerDull stupid plot line with repeat #flashbacks. The worst plot line since #doctorwho #SleepAnotherDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#sweeteze is an existing anti-sweet site #awkward #TheApprentice2017. But it is a good concept @Lord_Sugar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #DoctorWhoAtTheProms on prerecord @BBCOne why don‚Äôt you repeat or redo this it is truly #phenomenal #loveit #bbcproms<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@imacelebrity @antanddec The only good thing is welcome back Ant so good to see your fighting fit @antanddec<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imacelebrity @antanddec the least interesting #ImACelebrity start ever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@richardosman the UK has produced some of the greatest ever #sitcoms but #celebritypointless had 3 American to 2 UK? #why?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SaturdayNightTV #SameOld #giveusabreak nothing new or original<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AverageTVViewer I totally agree but they seem to flog everything like a dead horse these days. #XFactor repeated the next day, #CrimeAndPunishment within a few days. @itvpresscentre #lessismore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ImACelebrity2017 is the best show on #ITV but their constant #plugging is putting me off it #overkill @antanddec #help<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhoPotterVian Well #StrictlyComeDancing2017 is thrashing it in the ratings, although I don‚Äôt like that either. Bring back #DoctorWho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@antanddec @ITV @imacelebrity #ImACeleb #imacelebrity #imacelebritygetmeoutofhere #IACGMOOH<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RosslynMelinda Hmm either enjoying a multi-millionaire lifestyle or having a #BurgerKing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhoPotterVian Just about anything. In fact as it is on 2 consecutive days and gets repeated that‚Äôs 4 new programmes we could watch every week<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Harry_Styles smashes  #XFactor the only good thing about it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #XFactor is definitely now the #ExFactor. #TimeToSayGoodbye<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#RobertSugden‚Äôs face when #LawrenceWhite #CameOn to him was #hilarious #Emmerdale well done @itv<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cflanjo Totally agree. S1 easy to sympathise with #DoctorFoster. But S2 she is equally #psycho &amp; Tom turned into a #SelfAbsorbed #brat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonCoussens Couldn‚Äôt agree more. Series 1 gripping  series 2 strangled to death<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@absent4u Sorry but I‚Äôve been in Tom‚Äôs position. The ending was #shite as was the whole series<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anneranner I‚Äôm with you, underwhelmed beyond belief<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OllieCharles Well for me if I‚Äôd known the way series 2 would go I‚Äôd have done a Tom from the start and #Runaway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#doctorfoster well that is 5 hours of #TVviewing I‚Äôll never get back. #pileofxxxx #UtterRubbish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PennyBurnard That sort of sums up the poor #storyline throughout season 2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finale of #DoctorFoster is just a #PaddingFiller episode. #SoDull. Please #DoNotResuscitate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now #bingewatching #safehouse &amp; once again @sarker #stormingperformance. One of our best #actresses<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GBBO2017 format still great and @PrueLeith an improvement but it needs different presenters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I understand why @Itv‚Äôs breakfast show is called #Lorraine because it‚Äôs all about her &amp; most interviews are 10% guest &amp; 90% her talking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TessDaly @ClaudiaWinkle a truly moving tribute to #SirBruceForsyth Tess your tears were shared by us all #StrictlyComeDancing2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm confused by comments on #DoctorFoster they've made such a strong women so pathetic I won't be watching episode 2. #goodbye<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So strong in series 1 &amp; yet third series it's all about #jealousy #SoWrong not real  https://t.co/vBWqfZh0fw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DoctorFoster series 1 Fab. Series 2 so far #dull #boring #losttheplot no continuity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #DoctorFoster on the latest #widescreenTV &amp; yet still got bars top &amp; bottom. Come on @bbc why #CinemaScope?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What are @itv trying to do to @reallorraine? The latest credits make her look even more #selfindulgent &amp; #vain than the old ones did #shame<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ITVLorraine why bother with guests? You've got @TeamWhittaker as main guest but 40 mins in just quiz twice, fashion et al but no guest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why doesn't @BBC replace @BBCFOUR with its minuscule audience with @BBCSport  them leave @BBCOne to non sport lovers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@myghostr TBH haven't heard of her at all along with most of the contestants<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@antsky @channel5_tv @EmmaWillis Well it's hard to be original when there really are almost no celebrities in there Einstein.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@flintbedrock Bigger issue is will the scripts stand up. #PeterCapaldi had 2 seasons of dross before his last was ok. I'm dreading this may go all PC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It depends on script quality as we saw with the dross #petercapaldi had in first 2 series. But not looking forward to new female #DoctorWho  https://t.co/K2CpiAYzm4<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@garrymoggerhang Entering next year. #Curried Scallops, curried soup, curried cheesecake, curried game pie, curried Stew, curried lemon tart. Think I'll win?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CoryMacRae Pleased for her personally she must be chuffed, but I agree all she did was twists on Asian food, when did she challenge herself? Not worthy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rakibmiah Sorry but where was the subtlety of flavours and unique mix of flavours? It was #FiftyShadesOfCurry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MASTERCHEFonFOX What UK Sky channel? It has to be better than @BBCOne's #politicallycorrect version<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#littleboyblue so good but it shows the hatred between the police and the poorest parts of society, to the ultimate extreme #hardwatching<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Samanthaspiro #JamieWinston &amp; co were brilliant in #Babs but they were let down by a weak script &amp; #shocking production. A good story bad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevinHarrisQC #Babs real story so interesting so how the hell did the @BBC manage to make it so dull?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MisterUppity Couldn't agree more it's spoiling the run of the story with an impossible hypothetical audience of dad and daughter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like #Babs but what's with old watching young crap. Another trendy over thought production spoiling the story #ffs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay it's #thedurrells time. Love the writing, acting &amp; setting. Proper Sunday #FamilyViewing @ITV @Misskeeleyhawes<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GoodIdeaTom @ITV Well said. @itv seem to like the one item per advert break. Think #xfactor #thevoiceuk. It makes the show so slow &amp; dull<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mrshobbs1986 @antanddec Too late @itv brought back #SaturdayMorning #CITV to Sunday night but without the fun or humour #Bigheads<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyACL That was the potential but now watching it &amp; think @antanddec please bring back #RedOrBlack ü§£ü§£ü§£<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WhoPotterVian That's not entirely fair. They haven't done #wonkydonkey although there is still time @JasonManford<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheTVGrump @rattycastle @HuffPostUKEnt I was thinking the same. Although he was still better than most as a host<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Just finished #comicrelief #bestbits to remind me what I missed falling asleep Friday. It's lost the #comedy &amp; is just a long #chugfest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Should someone tell @GaryBarlow he's put his boxers over the top of his suit? @antanddec #SaturdayNightTakeaway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TVSpiv it's all the why and not the #entertain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok I'm ready for the trolls but #comicrelief has been produced by the worst #xfactor #thevoice team. #nohumour too much #gloom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do #TVbosses think #football is the most important thing in the world? #NoEntertainment cos there's a friendly #ffs #benidorm #corrie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhoPotterVian @radioleary @davidwalliams soz I never watch late evening @ITV news so sorry not me. But I am a #Whovian &amp; like #harrypotter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhoPotterVian @radioleary no they complain cos it is such #awfulTV. So bad even real talent like Dermot &amp; @davidwalliams can't make it work<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhoPotterVian @radioleary don't worry the #toothfairy &amp; #fatherchristmas will keep you safe &amp; happy. #deluded #dreamworld #nightnight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhoPotterVian @radioleary when did I ever mention bringing back the news at ten just put #thenightlyshow out of its misery #TVeuthanasia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not as well known as #LaurelAndHardy or #morecambeandwise both of whom would be more entertaining despite being sadly deceased. Nice try  https://t.co/G5NzbeCalT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhoPotterVian @radioleary and so is hemorrhoid cream but we don't want to see it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhoPotterVian @radioleary the one where their star faded 10 years ago! #hasbeens. Loved them then like I loved #billandben but seriously?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And so was getting #piles  https://t.co/aYl687XaNc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No I haven't  https://t.co/YSnl2JR0jQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow I'm so excited I may have to #switchoff  https://t.co/uDMNttlgio<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad he has some talent because entertainment isn't one of them #thenightlyshow #tvdregs  https://t.co/NuyYQQiPQR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep almost as brilliant as hitting my head against a brick wall. Tomorrow I may consider putting my hand in a fire  https://t.co/i2gD9VKDWV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DISTlNCT @ShitelyNo you should have stopped at just awful lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carolynmccue63 @ShitelyNo that's not fair. It's nowhere near that good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheTVGrump I disagree. It's the #televisual equivalent of #euthanasia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#thenightlyshow should be renamed #deathbyathousandcuts nightly show. @radioleary quit now whilst u can #awfulguests #hasbeens #neverwillbe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is there anything worse than someone back from a, paid for, dream holiday droning on about it? @ITVLorraine #MeMeMe #giveusabreak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBC_TopGear #MattLeBlanc has brought a totally new &amp; modern vibe to the show. Sorry @JeremyClarkson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamwill have you heard the legend Chuck Berry has died   https://t.co/rPQIvggMju<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamwill @TanyaLacey @meeshjohn if you say "it's a great TV Spiv" on air I will üëå<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am really warming to @GavinRossdale on #thevoice seems like a genuinely nice guy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would love a face off between TVs best double acts @antanddec &amp; @MelGiedroycTV &amp; @sueperkins<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MelGiedroycTV &amp; @sueperkins you are #rocking #primetime #singanddance #comicrelief great entertainment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan bet you'd do it for half that Piers?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kategarraway downing #Guinness at 7am. What more proof that she should be doing more on TV #TVLegend  https://t.co/sosc9w4HbO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Am I the only person in the UK who just doesn't get @HarryHill ? #childish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThisisDavina is actually making #thenightlyshow slightly less awful tonight, but still #AwfulTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#littlebigshots UKis a take the #britainsgottalent cute kid slot &amp; make a whole show but with too many arrogant rather unpleasant kids<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheReplacement is compelling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ITVLorraine @Fearnecotton has shown how much better the show.could be with a new presenter. How about @HelenSkelton too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MelGiedroycTV you're better off not doing it #turkey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ITV how many more weeks of the @ITVNightlyShow do we have left to endure! #BringBackTheNewsAtTen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#callthemidwife just keeps getting better. Love the return of Reggie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fearnecotton is the best thing to hit #breakfastTV in years. Keep @ITVLorraine on holiday forever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does #thenightlyshow which is filmed in a theatre with a live audience sound like it has #cannedlaughter? @ITV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#thenightlyshow so looking forward to.......,, the series end @ITV makes the #PetOscars seem interesting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BroadchurchTV Noooo. Was so good then you ruined it. As far as I know it's impossible to block your number sending a text #broadchurch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBC_TopGear only been on 30 seconds &amp; loving it already @Matt_LeBlanc &amp; co #TopGear is back!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Schofe #FiveGoldRings pretty hood for the slot it's in. Can play along at home which is good but needs a bit of speed please<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm afraid the @ITVNightlyShow is more the #NotNightly viewing show. Dull and uninteresting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Catching up on @ITV #playtothewhistle how can a show with @BradleyWalsh &amp; @hollywills be so utterly awful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ITV do you really have to trail every new show on every break? #ffs #giveusabreak. Fed up of the shows already<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watched #ThoseMagnificentMenInTheirFlyingMachines a true #classicFilm &amp; better than Sat night on UK TV @BBC @ITV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Couldn't put it better @ScarlettMoffatt you rock  https://t.co/KlaZG77mZr<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I now know why @BBCOne called it #ssgb it stands for Softly Spoken Garbled Banter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan I would join the #WengerForever team as an #LFC fan. But it's more a case of any trophy whenever for us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only @emmerdale could interrupt #robron's wedding for a #BlackWidow plot. #excellent and #hilarious. Well done team<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCOne @BBCCasualty flight late so U go straight to work! Ok. Then U start dancing around &amp; #messingaround #getreal #drama not #Disney<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah @antanddec back next week. Welcome back lads<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So it's ok for @dennisrodman to #FlickThe Vs on @itv #throughthekeyhole?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thevoiceuk loving @iamwill &amp; @RealSirTomJones but need some spark in the others. How about adding @OzzyOsbourne for 2018?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#seriously has anyone ever been tempted to buy #perfume because of the awful #screechymusic &amp; dark #artyvideos?  https://t.co/lNhfNFd5zV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just started watching @jackiefilm. What a dull, pretentious &amp; even worse, boring film. #jackiekennedy deserves so much more than this #dross<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The final of @DanceDanceDance can't wait for it to be over so we can have something more stimulating to watch #realityoverload #CheapTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why spoil a great programme? Keep to the genre. We don't want @OnceABC turned into #HighSchoolMusical  https://t.co/9BiArjDMig<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robertcarlyle_ We are currently #bingewatching #OnceUponATime &amp; you have made one word the new family #catchphrase #Dearie Simply the best  https://t.co/wgQc91B7EL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So sad to hear @TPTpersonified has died. Always came across as someone who lived for today but was as mad as a #BoxOfFrogs. #RIP sweet lady<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryBarlow @BBCLetItShine if that was a #pilotshow I hope it doesn't get #syndicated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thevoiceuk #clicheridden my #bigmoment just want a #chairtoturn please #giveitarest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So refreshing to see real talent rejecting the #makemefamous #realityshow route. Good on you @TomMouseSmith and best wishes  https://t.co/PffGYCCZAB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NE1 else think TV &amp; film Cos are #racist about #India?#BestExoticMarigoldHotel #goodkarmahospital. #naff implying simplistic name culture<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MelGiedroycTV @GaryBarlow oops<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #OnceUponATime on @NetflixUK &amp; loving it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ITV @thevoiceuk please drop all the #backstory stuff it's boring &amp; why most record &amp; #fastforward so your advertisers losing out too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanMcKellen @BBC a great episode &amp; a lovely story. Can't believe the coincidences with your 2xGreat uncle being an actor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thegrandtour back to what @JeremyClarkson @MrJamesMay &amp; @RichardHammond do best. The #RangeRover is the best<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Such an acting genius #SitJohnHurt  https://t.co/qrtT6oid0j<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCOne @IanMcKellen #WhoDoYouThinkYouAre probably the best episode ever. If you missed it download it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well done @emmerdale #NTAs¬† the best soap of the year especially #johnmiddleton. His story is close to home but perfectly portrayed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another good reason for dropping @SkyUK. Why pay per month what @NetflixUK or @AmazonVideoUK gives you per annum  https://t.co/FY8HuzzdSh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So well deserved  https://t.co/4wWGq1FiGL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Should have gone to #jennacoleman  https://t.co/uz1mOXfeXY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@radioleary &amp; @ScarlettMoffatt doing a great job guys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GordonRamsay @HellsKitchenFOX when is #hotelnightmares and #masterchefUSA back on UK TV?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MelGiedroycTV &amp; @sueperkins u were robbed #NTAs but hats off to @antanddec well done lads. 4 of u make the art of TV presenting look easy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheHalcyon too many characters too many stories<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another night and another great episode from @itvcorrie. @msm4rsh &amp; @simongregson123 carrying of the tragedy with warmth &amp; affection<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hooray #callthemidwife back on @BBCOne simple family Sunday entertainment just what matron ordered<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCOne #taboo 2 much #mumbling #darklighting &amp; disjointed plotline. #lifetooshort to concentrate that much about characters we don't care 4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lemontwittor @itv #throughthekeyhole if u love spying on ord neighbours tonight was ur thing if u wanna be entertained by celebs goodnight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CelebJuice but it is awful and he is a nobody, beyond #zlist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok @lemontwittor #throughthekeyhole just #scrappedthebarrel even lower #abz5ive time to #CallItADay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lemontwittor #throughthekeyhole seriously @JamieLaing_UK is scraping the #Zlist barrel. If that's the best it's time to give it a rest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MartinClunesTV loving #IslandsofAustralia the scenery, camera work &amp; narrative blend perfectly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MidsomerTV just #Nonono so boring and repetitive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Enjoying the latest #locationlocationlocation with @PipofftheTV &amp; @KirstieMAllsopp it feels like it's got its #MOJO back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ITV #TheCruise ok but definitely a slot filler. It would have been #daytimetv 10 years ago<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deathinparadise another good show but I fear it is getting repetitive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emmerdale still the only #Tvshow with proper #bisexual character. Shows #SexualDiversity still not accurately portrayed on TV #ryanhawley<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan &amp; @susannareid100 have definitely saved #BreakfastTV in the U.K. Particularly Piers who is not afraid to say what we think<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ITV #TheHalcyon just doesn't have the characters you want to care about which is vital, as per #MrSelfridge #downtonabbey #Poldark etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok I'm going to be #controversial but apart from the Christmas special &amp; odd moments #TheGrandTour is descending into a big budget farce<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Channel4 #RestorationMan a great episode with the Cheshire water tower. How to make #artdeco utility into a modern home<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Binge watching #witchesofeastend  on @NetflixUK &amp; it's very very good. They should do more. #watchit #greattv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anyone else find @ITV #dancedancedance to just be a very lazy #MeToo production? A #StrictlyComeDancing without the warmth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spent the weekend #bingewatching @TheCrownNetflix. #ClaireFoy is superb &amp; #mattsmith is a revelation as the #DukeofEdinburgh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Sherlock another great episode from @Markgatiss &amp; #StevenMoffat. Loved the twists especially #UnaStubbs in an @astonmartin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ITV @lemontwittor #throughthekeyhole a good show but not the best guests. Moving from C to D list celebs homes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCCasualty another good episode tonight, but need to bring a positive end to the #DrKeogh story soon. #LiarsCantWin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@richardosman loved the show tonight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sophie_J611 know that feeling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well done @MelGiedroycTV &amp; @grahnort but @BBCLetItShine @GaryBarlow needs improvement more talent less #backstoryrubbish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lemontwittor @ITV can't wait. In need of proper entertainment like #throughthekeyhole<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#thevoiceuk so far different channel same programme. But not getting it with @IAMJHUD &amp; @GavinRossdale<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ITV &amp; #thevoiceuk like @BBCLetItShine when will u realise we watch for talent not #backstory &amp; #backstage rubbish long live #FastForward<|endoftext|>
