<|startoftext|>oh, I didn't even think about it, it's 2020 of course google auth goes down. doomsday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ediggs almost certainly an issue with their auth services, as it's broken across very far away services (YT for instance) and YT works in private mode/no login<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@taylorswift13 I am so glad that @TheRyanAdams covered your 1989 album and I found you (yes I live in a parallel world, away from pop/mainstream) can't wait to listen to this one, with Folklore being what I've listened to the most in 2020. Love you very much xx and thanks for everything you do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theburningmonk @jonathanstark I'll definitely have a read, thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theburningmonk @jonathanstark The main constraint to consultancy income is that it's based on headcount, and in your case, that's one head, with a limited amount of hours / days, you can scale and earn while not working with the videos, which is amazing. Of course you worked hard to become a solid brand 👏<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Falso_Nueve_IT Un film già visto, perderemo, una difesa colabrodo (Izzo sarebbe forse meglio? Se ha ancora voglia di giocare), un centrocampo che non aiuta ne in difesa ne in attacco.

<|startoftext|>Study findings revealed possible disruption to micro-structural and functional brain integrity in the recovery stages of #COVID19, suggesting the long-term consequences of #SARSCoV2.   https://t.co/OChRG4ZRNQ  Do you still want to catch it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I actually think he didn't understand the deal 🐒<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Legend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My daughter came back home with a cold after just 4 days of school. I am about to start sneezing.  We will all catch #covid it's just a matter of weeks, hopefully I won't get the nasty 6+ months version.  If you are at risk lock yourself up. That's easy messaging, not the gov one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LauraWeightman @lauramuiruns You'll get there, amazing job!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I fear that we haven't seen the worse of 2020 just yet. Hard #Brexit, #Covid coming back strong than ever, potentially some sort of civil war or at least a lot of violence and protests in the #USA post elections. It's gonna be a really bad winter.    https://t.co/GFfhR4yygo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SethJamesDeMoor Try the @injinji<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good idea, maybe one for @ProjectLincoln?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Needless to say that a certain @BorisJohnson ruined London before hand and let far right off the hook behaving like this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sadly I was expecting that. He's going to be a dictator. Putin is his role model, who's been in power for 20 years<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SethJamesDeMoor @Casio_USA @COROSGlobal @PolarGlobal @suunto I'm attached to my @Garmin forerunner 935 24/7 but i have to say the power meter in the polar is quite cool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bakermoore @SethJamesDeMoor This one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@antoguerrera Gran bel thread, le vacanze inglesi ti hanno fatto bene 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Channel4News Check out my 'experience' here  https://t.co/xeYEuxk6Bd basically also searched today for a non existent  postcode and got told to go Aberdeen, to the Highlands, Birmingham. The day before tried from SW16 and got no places to for a test<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@capotribu The more the tests the more the people with covid, 🎺 🎺 🎺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRickWilson I guess more Americans died in wars right? Not that I defend trump, don't get me wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Wait two max four weeks and we will be there in England. Can't get tested, eat out to catch covid, go to work but don't meet more than six people. Shambles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>you know @BorisJohnson what this reminds me, it reminds me of @realDonaldTrump 'the more the tests the more the people with the infection' - so there are fewer people infected in the UK (compared to Spain, France) because we don't test. Well done #CovidUK #CovidTesting #Covid19UK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SylviaTilaks @BorisJohnson Check my last tweet on the tread, it seems that Edgbaston is the only place that can do that, at least you are 'only' 50 miles from there! Other suggestions include Schotland and the Highlands! It's madness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Update on this thread.  You still CANNOT test in London and I assume generally in the south west and east of England. I tried with an invalid postcode and I got walk-in and drive-in centres for Scotland and Birmingham!   #CovidUK #CovidTesting #covidtest #BorisTheLiar  https://t.co/aX1h2rT8sr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiamKel52773663 @SethJamesDeMoor Yeah got a pair for my wife the other day at that price. What a steal!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GreenLe69138272 @RachaelBrwn @natashadevan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tried both drive trough and walk-in NOTHING. My own postcode masked for privacy in these screenshots.   I live in the South West of London.  https://t.co/HpLWO1roJf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>you CANNOT test for #COVID in the #uk you just can't!  I tried the web page at  https://t.co/fkErGM71kD as I've been feeling under the weather for the last few days and all I've got was NO TEST SITES AVAILABLE. What are you talking about @BorisJohnson when asking to track &amp; trace?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A year in masks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CastleTriathlon Nothing changes with the new gov rules re: max 6 people? Thanks<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Dazlar72 @UKCycleChat It's a tt bike with high bars, you don't need to be tucked in, something aereo but high up might work well, only a professional fit will figure out how can you put most power on the pedals without compromising aero positioning. I dig the shop in Crystal Palace if that's close by<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dazlar72 @UKCycleChat I've got the same bike and your same hight, which size did you go for? They suggested me (and sold me) a medium but I think I should have gone for an L. Did you get professional fitting? My seat post is insanely high and everything else stretched to its limits<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maggiecodes_ @juanguren Surely it should have been a 201 Created<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chipnanimus 20+40=60, 7+8 I take the two to make it 10 and then 5 left there so 60+10+5=75<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bbculp @Challenge_Famil @protriorg @worldtriathlon It's harder than running but what about FKT? Some pro can start doing that no?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/IbIbcqcXQ1 Can't wait to see the new world post covid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@MMFlint is right  https://t.co/6k9yr7I2FY  I can't tell from here the situation in the USA but I am worried about bots, Russian influence, and lack of democrazy due to @realDonaldTrump himself and social networks helping him out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In Italy they are doing 100.000 tests a day and planning to triplicate them to 300.000 a day in Autumn. What's your plan @BorisJohnson and where are you? How are you @BorisJohnson do you remember being sick and getting cured by foreigners? Do you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricSylvers So typically "ligure" or better "genovese"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesglynn 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@antoguerrera It accelerated processes that were already there: - train a lot for my ironman race - more wfh - less going out - more time with my family - less music discoveries (less time commuting, when I had headphones on) - more health conscious - even more pointless to live in London<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SethJamesDeMoor In theory, you can travel to a country which offers the smallest quarantine, then moving inside by train (or car!) should be ok. Hard but not impossible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cancelling a *DIGITAL* contract in Italy requires a *FAX* or a *LANDLINE* call or a PEC (what's a PEC anyway?) cc/@antoguerrera  https://t.co/OWGbjRXtaL<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bbculp @mattfitwriter 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@screaminghype @GaryMey46030592 @FerdiGiugliano @GarettJones @nytimes Yeah I doubt there will be more lockdowns, it will be would be catastrophic. I do enjoy being cold/flu free, with two young daughters it has been impossible in the past years. We've been too promiscuous, generally, as humanity, catching a cold should not be ok<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@screaminghype @GaryMey46030592 @FerdiGiugliano @GarettJones @nytimes Can't really do lockdowns forever (arguably they should have never done them) but rather a lot rigour with social distancing, wearing masks, wash hand frequently, definitely no mass gatherings of any sort...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ameliaboone I actually started taking  https://t.co/yyo0SRU7Mf just recently and I did feel a difference, I was completely flat, struggling to get up in the morning and go train, now I am much better (training for my first 70.30 IM)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nadinebh_ I agree and you can provably state the same about most 'first world' Countries. Fortunately we evolve as humanity and the horrors of the past seem, at least, something for history books.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@londongopher_ Did you notice only now? Trains and broadband don't work in this country when it's too hot (overheat) or when it rains (floodings). Things work when it's that anonymous middle season gray sky, dry weather 10-15C<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbculp Better than IM VR series, that's for sure, at least they use same kit, same environment, same temperature...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"the risk of picking up the virus in schools was small"  https://t.co/nNusUNbtNl  Isn't incorrect, kids get it but it's mostly asymptomatic, so if a family is at high risk what would happen? If a pupil meets their grandparents regularly?  This gov sounds like @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BettySea_ @mikegalsworthy Yep that's the problem with populism, there is no rationale behind the tought or the shout. It will be EU fault for decades.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProjectLincoln @realDonaldTrump 22% of overall #COVID19 deaths with only 4% of the world population. But you don't get maths do you?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RAFALOCA1 @MaxCRoser maybe you are right maybe not. I am not qualified enough. I've read that Sweden regretted the choice and I've read that east-Asian countries suffered fewer thanks to masks.  Also I read that 0.5% != 3.5% And I also read that herd is not working yet with COVID because of mutations  https://t.co/ozj7DmCaD5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RAFALOCA1 @MaxCRoser I am not sure you can claim that. What I've seen in (north) Italy is a high usage of face masks, social distancing and generally, everyone is following the rules really well.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@irun4ultra I noticed you liking multiple tweets from @realDonaldTrump, sadly I'll have to unfollow you. Running should be apolitical.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@benedictevans @gideon_b yeah Facebook is clever and powerful right ;0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gideon_b @benedictevans A simple thing to implement would be to 'allow' to reference only content to newspapers and sites that adhere to an ethical manifesto, that would avoid so much clickbait and fake news (or harmful content)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lottsoflove21 Amazing video, congrats on the dogs, very well behaved, no way we could do this here with ours ;-) x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benedictevans Tricky I guess if not impossible.  Or trust the source?  Anyway I think the biggest issue is bumping stories via adverts rather than the simple share of a fact o 'fake news'<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@run_treadmill I think swift running and especially the group runs pushed me harder and that's probably not something that everyone uses or has used in the past. I agree on the heat stress and you sweat so much more so need constant refuelling. I always leave my treadmill at min 2% incline<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@run_treadmill Interesting, I've been running on a treadmill only for almost two months now, self isolating, and getting some PBs up to half marathon distance. I keep wondering if I'll be slower back out on the normal road.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sturdyAlex the London at the excel costs a fortune (rented from Bahrein if I am not mistaken); the herd plan was only dismissed in public speeches but in reality, it has always been in place; @BorisJohnson words to get ready to miss 'a few ill and elderly' still echoing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Samirkaji I'll have to keep running on the treadmill I bought to justify the expense! In the large I hope that 'cutting the middle man' economies will flourish. Like buying wholesale food, directly from producers, etc. Oh we learnt how to make gnocchi, we'll never buy them again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nobody could be prepared for #COVIDー19 but some were more ready than others<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sturdyAlex I tweeted earlier today that everything has been planned, the lack of care for the elderly (we'll have to get ready to loose some beloved ones), the sort of herd plan and the fanfare for hospitals and ventilators, unused because who cares for the elder and ill<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1) 'many more families are going to lose loved ones'  https://t.co/oSqxqdCR2j 2) Herd immunity: yes it was 'part of the plan'  https://t.co/eMMNSgU7Lb 3) Only half of UK's sickest coronavirus patients put on ventilators   https://t.co/W0gJ6GH9WR  I am quite sure this was all planned<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bbculp @IRONMANtri lol probably you can do that easily taking off the friction from the turbo trainer, quite slow if you do it like that I guess. I think I can do better :-D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@akilpin I love the initiative, I didn't knew there's slots for qualifying, but I think we might need to start thinking that even kona might be virtual this year. There are apps to even tell zwift your speed on the treadmill But surely IM will fact check the data.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bromka IMO it offers a nice experience for large teams, with the capability of seeing everyone and sharing screen very easily. Great streaming performance. Concerns around privacy, security and I do agree that there are plenty of other tools in the market<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@codyhigdem @antoguerrera The problem with the model that @antoguerrera shared is that they were predicting a peak that has already been reached (yesterday) where clearly we are far in the UK from the peak.  I am not 100% sure if China has been lower because of age only. Perhaps some numbers are missing<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dzuelke dude I worked with @jimwebber I think I've heard of hypermedia a couple of times, thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darrel_miller @dzuelke in fact my default choice if not when talking with an external API would be anyway something like zeromq (in my ctx)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dzuelke sure sure that example is clear, having said that, xml and the code that will consume will tend to break (or ignore change) anyway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dzuelke no claims, and I think twitter is not the right tool to discuss these sort of things but if you pass by london ping me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dzuelke I like your pickyness, in my experience, at my rather good job I don't need xml, can you stop tweeting me now, thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dzuelke and can be definitely exposed as json, saving my eyes from seeing that markup where is not needed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dzuelke all I was saying with my initial tweet is that there are quite a load of API (no rest) in this damn world that are exposed in xml<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dzuelke you won, keep using xml if it's good for you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juokaz btw I even worked with @martinfowler, u should better read the post: "I'm using XML..but the content can actually be anything: JSON"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>not sure why people got so animate after my last tweet, I worked a couple of years without it & still doing fine & also without hypermedia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lviggiano json is super easy to parse, esp. from ruby, I can create it easily, it's more concise, it's an hash for me. so it's 4 laziness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dzuelke cool, explain, provide links, enlight me. thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juokaz I wasted enough time talking about xml to be honest, but have a look at this maybe  http://t.co/1zhqZtLW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juokaz lwhat are you talking about? whatever you can do in xml you can do it in json, first result in google search:  http://t.co/CoNzlWK3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juokaz I'm talking about Rest API interfaces, and there's plenty of services that are trying to get API usage easier. no need 4markup sorry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@giorgiosironi you mean more verbose and complicated for no reason, u can write any sw in the world using just hashes, no need of xml 4sure<|endoftext|>
