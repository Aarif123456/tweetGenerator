<|startoftext|>@AaronBlaiseArt Thanks Aaron, look forward to it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliciaMarieBODY Yeah i understand, i just can't imagine living this, the us seems so surreal sometimes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeJohn11085074 @AliciaMarieBODY Because the US is messed up. Growing up in Australia, you went to school with a mixed bag of skin colored kids and nobody gave a damn.   Free healthcare and free education. When you go to uni/ college, you pay for it after you finish the degree and when you stary working<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@icecube How can you go home to your family each day as a police officer like this and turn around and say, "Yes, today I did the right thing!"   Shame on you, pricks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@icecube Damn, this shit makes me so 😡  F**k cant even imagine what it would be like to live like this every day.  As a white male living in Australia, I feel so sorry for all the daily sht you guys have to deal with. How you walk, talk, move, anything you say - reallly messed up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seems fair. Whatever it takes to reduce the spread of the virus.  #COVID #COVID19Aus #police #SlowTheSpread<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hopefully people will start to take it more seriously  Police will enforce strict stay-at-home directions in Victoria's hotspots if spread cannot be slowed before July 19, as epidemiologists warn a "severe regional lockdown" might be needed sooner to curb.  https://t.co/2BBMDItnxf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AaronBlaiseArt Hey @AaronBlaiseArt what an incredible gesture - your generosity is absolutely incredible. Thank you for helping the community 👏👏👏<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JeremyECrawford Congratulations, big step for sure. . Completely ridiculous when you look at the fact that it is news. This is about a century too late...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheCarlWeathers Damn. I hope the rest of the year turns out better.... you guys have a long read ahead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get on it guys... he's a brilliant teacher.  #sketch #art #animation #aaronblaise #DistanceLearning #drawing<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Amazing work by @AaronBlaiseArt   Standing together against one cause.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CriticalBard At least he is trying ffs....no need to laugh at the guy making an effort.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All for #melbourneprotest but after 3 months of lockdown, hopefully this isn't too much of a setback #SocialDistanacing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😬😬😬 not going to deny it, I'm quite nervous about this  #Sydneyprotest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mpwoodhead You couldn't wait 2 weeks...amazing to see how quick the hard work can disappear. the cost this is going to have on the economy in the long term is going to be fun<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AliciaMarieBODY Nope. In Australia it was once a week on Monday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliciaMarieBODY Would have egged her<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AaronBlaiseArt You are obviously trying to do the right thing but its come across in the worst possible way (for some people). The fact you apologized for any harm you may have done &amp; also mentioned it in your request day shows how much it affected you. I hope you are feeling better today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahMasonArt @AaronBlaiseArt Thats a horrible thing to say. He is obviously trying.  If he didn't care at all, he wouldn't make an effort to apologise but anyway...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliciaMarieBODY Also, really hope you and your community are staying safe. I hope you guys really get what you set out to achieve. Its all over the news here in Australia.  Look after yourselves as much as you can during this time ❤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliciaMarieBODY *Alchemist  Very nice<|endoftext|>
