<|startoftext|>@aishatyler I have been raging all day over this. I am so disgusted it was even published and @WSJ needs to issue an apology to @DrBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DouglasEmhoff @DrBiden I watched my wife pour her entire being into her Phd. She is pioneering research into learning disabilities and you damn straight better believe she deserves her Dr. title. As do ALL doctorate holders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nels_MissuJerry @DouglasEmhoff @DrBiden For those who don't get what a doctorate is. Imagine not calling an actor an actor because they ONLY work on TV or film and not on the stage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nels_MissuJerry @DouglasEmhoff @DrBiden *sigh* For those again...a doctorate degree refers to a degree awarded for producing original research in your field. The title Doctor refers to being a teacher or top of your field. And medical degree is a medical degree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CE14591398 @HambotverMemes @SopanDeb @DrBiden 'Tis true, 'tis true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HambotverMemes @CE14591398 @SopanDeb @DrBiden A doctorate isn't a medical degree. A doctorate is a degree awarded for producing original research. Hence the word coming from the Latin term for teacher. A medical degree is a medical degree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HambotverMemes @CE14591398 @SopanDeb @DrBiden Seriously? Snappy logic their son. The root of the word doctor is from the Latin word docere, meaning to teach, so it seems like a pretty fitting title for people who make a dissertation and produce original research.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HambotverMemes @CE14591398 @SopanDeb It's not ignorant. You earn the title.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hekatesgal @edgar_a_bitch Seriously? That is insane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LA_Knight89 @ConsueloBurrito @yeralizard Agree with you COMPLETELY. My original comments were about the industry. Before Sia opened her mouth. There were a lot of threads about this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edgar_a_bitch Wait WHAT did I miss???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LA_Knight89 @ConsueloBurrito @yeralizard And before you come back, I am a ND individual who worked on set for years so I actually do know what I am talking about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LA_Knight89 @ConsueloBurrito @yeralizard It was not a "woe is Sia" take. I absolutely blasted her. But a lot of people just saying "cast an autistic dancer" who don't have any experience in the industry or understanding of how HARD it is to cast such a specific role is bull shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Spiritualincel @kkchap26 @TheKingsTings No, it's just that copyright is literally the only thing They do care about. Reading a spec or pitch (or fan fic even) for your show you didn't ask for is setting your job on fire.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@potato6023 @Metalsniper @Pegglepuss @svtrighthereb @zigmund_palffy @fgritchie @ABC2020 And your facts are still not correct. She had gone to HIS house to pick up personal items. He was not there. The USPS have stated that they had not provided any information to the investigation. They screwed up, murdered her, then tried to cover it up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Metalsniper @Pegglepuss @svtrighthereb @zigmund_palffy @fgritchie @ABC2020 What the fuck does that mean? She didn't.  She was executed by trigger happy cops.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@potato6023 @Metalsniper @Pegglepuss @svtrighthereb @zigmund_palffy @fgritchie @ABC2020 Kenneth Walker was not a known criminal and shot at unknown people he heard breaking in to his house.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Metalsniper @Pegglepuss @svtrighthereb @zigmund_palffy @fgritchie @ABC2020 That. That right there. #BreonnaTaylor did NOT break the law.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zigmund_palffy @Metalsniper @fgritchie @ABC2020 The point is that it is unreasonable to assume they knew it was the police when they had been asleep. The police should NOT have entered with force. No life was in jeapody, no immediate crime was being committed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@svtrighthereb @Metalsniper @zigmund_palffy @fgritchie @ABC2020 YES!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zigmund_palffy @Metalsniper @fgritchie @ABC2020 People constantly spout off  "stand your ground" but when black people did it, the response is they should not have had a gun. It's a racist double standard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Metalsniper @svtrighthereb @zigmund_palffy @fgritchie @ABC2020 I've been in my house in the middle of the day and not heard people knock on my door. That late, in the dark, they should have pounded and knocked on the door until they opened it. Not knock once then break in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Metalsniper @zigmund_palffy @fgritchie @ABC2020 But yet white people can say "if you come in my house you will get shot" and police just nod like "yes that's your right". Bull shit. They entered that house at midnight - in the dark - they were ready tom execute whoever was inside.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustRozay I won't retweet this, cos white girl, but yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am still sitting here wondering how the bodycam footage wasn't enough evidence for excessive force and, oh you know, MURDER. #SayHerName #BreonnaTaylor #BlackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustCallMeBeu No. The fact your asking that means you're not. It is heartbreaking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fgritchie @ABC2020 Did they name that officer who said that? Someone with that level of indifference to human life should not be a cop. #SayHerName #BreonnaTaylor #DefundThePolice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zigmund_palffy @fgritchie @ABC2020 No, that comment is what he thinks of human life. You don't deserve to be shot for dealing drugs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They try and get the postal service in it too? The "criminal" Jamarcus who refused to lie about her is the only one who isn't corrupt.  #SayHerName #BreonnaTaylor #BlackLivesMatter #DefundThePolice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can we all take a moment to admit that if Jamarcus Glover was white, that warrant would have been served in the middle of the day to the correct house. #SayHerName #BreonnaTaylorWasMurdered #BreonnaTaylor #BlackLivesMatter #DefundThePolice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wannabeitgurl Thanks for pointing this out. I've only used say her name but I had seen say his name for George Floyd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She was a daughter. She was a healthcare worker. She was a HUMAN. Her life was cut short but we will make her legacy eternal. #SayHerName #BreonnaTaylor #BlackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brett Hankinson (sp) should rot in prison. #SayHerName #BreonnaTaylor #BlackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The audio of Tamika realising her daughter is gone is the pain these police officers deserve. #SayHerName #BreonnaTaylor #BlackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Administrative reassignment" FUCK that. This was an execution by corrupt trigger happy cops and a systemic cover up. #DefundThePolice #SayHerName #BreonnaTaylor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*No need<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There must be a federal law to stop warrants being served after dark in non emergent cases. There was need for those officers to be there so late. #SayHerName #BlackLivesMatter #BreonnaTaylor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry Nicki Mattingly, but your husband was not the one who deserved to live that night. #SayHerName #BreonnaTaylor #BlackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThicciLake That officer needs to be locked up and never see the light of day. That one comment was his declaration of racism and power corruption. #SayHerName #BreonnaTaylor #BlackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We said the exact same thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatrinaBrooksMS The "that's a shame" response from the cop after Kenny confirmed he was not hit just broke something inside of me. #BreonnaTaylor #SayHerName<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am seething with rage. #SayHerName #BreonnaTaylor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am currently watching this and seeing the body can footage of the officer saying "that's a shame" when Kenny said he had not been shot is enraging. How is that not grounds for that officer to be fired? #SayHerName #BreonnaTaylor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JessicaXDiamond @edgar_a_bitch Yeah, I made a comment, not in defense of her but more raised a point about the industry in general and then she tweeted what she did and literally shat over any kind of benefit of the doubt she could have had. Total bullshit.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FeliciaMichaels "...we had words for a bit" conjures up beautiful imagery.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mindamurphy @willsonjamesd @literarypanckes @luckylimegreen @supportingsia @Sia @HelenAngel @EmilyPember @Kris10Parisi @autisticbruce @Variety @dominickevans No.  (an example because it is on my TV as I type this) The pool of actors who could have played the President in The West Wing is MUCH larger than the character I described.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mindamurphy @willsonjamesd @literarypanckes @luckylimegreen @supportingsia @Sia @HelenAngel @EmilyPember @Kris10Parisi @autisticbruce @Variety @dominickevans It's not, it's the same situation as if the role was a 5-year-old blind violin prodigy from Kenya. The more specific a character the harder it is to cast. That's the point I was making.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mindamurphy @willsonjamesd @literarypanckes @luckylimegreen @supportingsia @Sia @HelenAngel @EmilyPember @Kris10Parisi @autisticbruce @Variety @dominickevans That it is an incredibly specific role and the reality is, is that something like that is very hard to cast. A separate issue from Sia's current attitude which is disgusting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mindamurphy @willsonjamesd @literarypanckes @luckylimegreen @supportingsia @Sia @HelenAngel @EmilyPember @Kris10Parisi @autisticbruce @Variety @dominickevans Sia's current behavior is disgusting. BUT my point came as a ND person who has worked on TV on set. Take Sia out of the situation and just look at the role - it is a VER specific role and the reality that casting it could be difficult is just that, a matter of a small acting pool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nico_appleby @ConsueloBurrito @yeralizard I am a diagnosed ND person and have worked on some of the biggest television series in the last ten years on set. My comments are from experience, not ableism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nico_appleby @ConsueloBurrito @yeralizard No I ABSOLUTELY agree with you and though I maintain that the role was SO specific that casting it would have been difficult, my last comment was Sia let her desire for maddie to be the role cloud the search for another actress.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just caught @kayleighmcenany doing a press briefing and holy shit if she was Pinocchio she would have impaled everyone in the room. She sold her soul to be unemployed come Jan 21.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaslerNoel @realDonaldTrump I want so much to see the video of him waddling off set to change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@literarypanckes @luckylimegreen @supportingsia @Sia @HelenAngel @EmilyPember @Kris10Parisi @autisticbruce @Variety @dominickevans Her behavior is disgusting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edgar_a_bitch She let her internal desire for the role to be played by Maddie cloud the search for a ND dancer.  Why not have it as a story about the autistic dancer and maddie as a secondary character with her own story? Or 2 movies?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@literarypanckes @luckylimegreen @supportingsia @Sia @HelenAngel @EmilyPember @Kris10Parisi @autisticbruce @Variety @dominickevans I would absolutely say she let her desire for the role to be played by Maddie cloud the search.  Why not have it as a story about the autistic dancer and maddie as a secondary character with her own story?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@literarypanckes @luckylimegreen @supportingsia @Sia @HelenAngel @EmilyPember @Kris10Parisi @autisticbruce @Variety @dominickevans Also lets not for a second believe that tole was for anyone but Maddie. That is the problem too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@literarypanckes @luckylimegreen @supportingsia @Sia @HelenAngel @EmilyPember @Kris10Parisi @autisticbruce @Variety @dominickevans Absolutely. It should be. My point is - Sias shitty behavior aside - no one is willing to discuss the possibility that practically speaking maybe they could not find someone for the role.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay so Sia is being a dick but I am seeing a whole lot of people who have never worked on a set before talking about how this movie should have been made.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@literarypanckes @luckylimegreen @supportingsia @Sia @HelenAngel @EmilyPember @Kris10Parisi @autisticbruce @Variety @dominickevans You can't change things like the set lights or the sound of the generators.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willsonjamesd @literarypanckes @luckylimegreen @supportingsia @Sia @HelenAngel @EmilyPember @Kris10Parisi @autisticbruce @Variety @dominickevans No, but he is self described as high functioning. He was not diagnosed till well into his life. He obviously can handle say a make up artist touching his face. This is not the case for all ND people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luckylimegreen @literarypanckes @supportingsia @Sia @HelenAngel @EmilyPember @Kris10Parisi @autisticbruce @Variety @dominickevans Not saying Sia was right. I am just not seeing all pieces of the puzzle being discussed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willsonjamesd @literarypanckes @luckylimegreen @supportingsia @Sia @HelenAngel @EmilyPember @Kris10Parisi @autisticbruce @Variety @dominickevans Anthony Hopkins has had 5 decades he is not a young teenage girl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luckylimegreen @literarypanckes @supportingsia @Sia @HelenAngel @EmilyPember @Kris10Parisi @autisticbruce @Variety @dominickevans Set lights alone would be too much for some with sensory issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luckylimegreen @literarypanckes @supportingsia @Sia @HelenAngel @EmilyPember @Kris10Parisi @autisticbruce @Variety @dominickevans I'm not saying that at all. But the role calls for a teenage autistic high level dancer. That role is so specific your acting pool is small. Add to that an autistic person being able to handle an on set environment makes it smaller.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@literarypanckes @luckylimegreen @supportingsia @Sia @HelenAngel @EmilyPember @Kris10Parisi @autisticbruce @Variety @dominickevans I am not condoning her actions but just "accommodating" is not as easy on a movie set as say an office or a classroom. It just isn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisLeeDLC @SmileHo_ya @nikki_zielinski @xocamilarose @skhndh No I am just aware that callous was your word of the day and you had no real argument. Hiring is hard. I hired people that handled money, I HAD to know how to find trust worthy people. If a resume gap didn't raise flags I never asked about it, to the original point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ConsueloBurrito @yeralizard I think we are agreeing just saying it differently. And this thread was specifically saying Maddie should not have been the lead because she is not autistic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisLeeDLC @SmileHo_ya @nikki_zielinski @xocamilarose @skhndh It is a hard knock life bud. Sorry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ConsueloBurrito @yeralizard 2/2 finding a person who really is that who can also act who also WANTS to act is going to be extremely difficult.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ConsueloBurrito @yeralizard 1/2 It's not about special concessions. It's about literally being able to do what a director tells you and then being able to change that for the next take. Yes autistic people can 100% do that. But if your character is say a 100% nonverbal violin prodigy...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ConsueloBurrito @yeralizard Well in this particular instance, Sia wrote the movie as a Maddie project. And absolutely ableism in the industry needs addressing but it comes down to money. Autism could impact production differently to say a deaf actor or someone in a wheelchair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisLeeDLC @SmileHo_ya @nikki_zielinski @xocamilarose @skhndh What attitude? The real world experience to offer the other side of an argument you can't hack? Sure thing my dude.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisLeeDLC @SmileHo_ya @nikki_zielinski @xocamilarose @skhndh I'm not callous. I am a great manager. And put together great teams. But there is a process to it. You want callous? Try a performing arts audition or submit a manuscript for publication. Having your resume used by HR the way it is meant to be used is nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisLeeDLC @SmileHo_ya @nikki_zielinski @xocamilarose @skhndh Again, if you have never had to hire someone you don't get to bitch and moan. Grow up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The sweet irony is that Biden's team is acting professional but the judges and lawyers on Trumps cases are basically all of us, saying "nun uh GTFO".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SmileHo_ya @ChrisLeeDLC @nikki_zielinski @xocamilarose @skhndh Thank you! If you haven't been on the hiring end of the application process you really can't bitch about it. I had 130 resumes drop in my inbox on the first day for last position I was hiring for. If we have contacted you yeah we need to know as much info as possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DembaiSystem work on your own damn personality. Pointing out the shitty reality of an industry doesn't make me ableist. But i will be sure to tell my equine therapy clients what you think of me for a good laugh. Maube listen ratner than just blocking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay pointing out the shitty reality of the entertainment industry does not make someone ableist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DembaiSystem @yeralizard Yup you would block rather than engage in a dialogue. Mm hmm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DembaiSystem @yeralizard And using the case of someone WHO OVERCAME the hardest part of their condition is not the slam dunk point you think it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DembaiSystem @yeralizard Don't tell me to shut up for making a point as a) someone who is neurodivergent b) someone who has done 20 hour days on set.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yeralizard Though the "inspiration" videos part makes me cringe, it is NOT just as easy as "hire an autistic dancer". Anyone who has worked in real film will know this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnBarrowman I just made the same comment. Guess he can't afford his L'oreal anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HKrassenstein @lzakshorn So a normal Friday for him?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepVernonJones @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden @ABC @NBCNews @CNN @MSNBC @nbc @CBS @washingtonpost @nytimes @fox @OANN @newsmax They all wore masks but media outlets DID in fact remind everyone to remember to stay safe and that crowds could be dangerous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CONCEDE YOU FUCKING BLOWHARD! OH YOU IGNORANT DANGEROUS FUCKWIT! #FuckTrump  and fuck all #TrumpSupporters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No Thanksgiving here. Tasty takeout and a bubble day with my wife.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaslerNoel @realDonaldTrump Has he even made one coherent sentence?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone who is saying "fuck the rules I'm having a huge Thanksgiving" should be forced to name, at the table, the family member they are okay with losing instead of giving thanks. #WearAMask #lockdown #StayHome #Thanksgiving<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GregMusselwhit3 @catturd2 Okay so answer me this. You think the mortality rate is acceptableble. Fine. Name the family member right here who you are okay with losing. And it can't be yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@catturd2 I hope the funerals of your family members are just as fun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottBaio @realDonaldTrump HA! You have no money to give him. He'll have no use for you in about 67 days. Enjoy his reflective twitter glory while it lasts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AviQuijada She did! Her eye needs to be stitched closed for the next two weeks to see if we can save it. One of those freak accident things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AviQuijada DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. Today I said "tomorrow Is Friday the 13th, what else can this year do?" And 3 HOURS LATER MY DOGS EYE FUCKING FELL OUT AND SHE NEEDED SURGERY. Yes you read that correctly. Her eye popped out of the socket.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HartHanson Three Cell Doors Down...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@biermann This is the climax of his E True Hollywood Story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TitusNation The irrational rage Tommy Lasagna gives me is like no other.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lesbiyinzer It's also not racist but kinda racist...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottBaio Is this your latest resume???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Accused assaulter @ScottBaio  being retweeted by another accused assaulter who also happens to be the president... douchebags really do travel in packs don't they.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zevonfan Seriously? I can't get blocked by Dead Cain, James Woods OR Scott Baio.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottBaio Well you need something to do between not-acting gigs. Dude grow up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay when your own lawyer jumps ship -you HAVE nothing! GiVE UP!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @VP it is your duty to uphold this election and the fair result.  The people have spoken and @JoeBiden is the new President Elect. You and @RealDonaldTrump must concede and allow the peaceful transfer of power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ewarren Look Elizabeth I know the helicopter rebate in the tax bill really made a difference to my bottom line...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealDeanCain Also, the dead people rumors have been debunked. The names reported were cross checked by officials and they had not cast votes, they had just not been purged from electoral roles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Punisher83743 @Solmemes1 This was done for tik tok views. Come on now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealDeanCain 5. Do you think it is responsible to delay national security? The same delay that adversely affected intelligence surrounding 9/11? You, and other higher profile Trump supporters need to use your platform to promote democracy and in this case the election of Joe Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealDeanCain 4. Also, the current charges of voter fraud all stand against people voting for the republican party. This is not this media saying that, it is accessible court documents. At what point do you say "we tried but it wasn't enough this time."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealDeanCain 3. President Trump's voters turned up. They did to the tune of 70m people. It is not the democratic parties fault that Democrats turned up too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealDeanCain 2. The biggest voter turn out in history plus a record number of mail in ballots and extra time for covid procedures all means this election was going to take longer to count. The GOP use the number of 145m voters in one breath but then claim fraud in the 100s of thousands?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealDeanCain 1. Dean I thought better of you. The election was fair, true and transparent. Yes. Every vote should be counted. Yes. Any issues should be fully investigated. However the reason no cases are moving forward is because nothing happened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robwhart @ChuckWendig What. A. Fucking. Toss Pot!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CatapultStory I just saw this and I am so excited to apply tomorrow!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Katiew552 I mean...that seems balanced to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec @DonaldJTrumpJr This shit is laughable seriously. He lost. Trump LOST DEAL WITH IT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump @DanSullivan_AK So...you agree, the media presented results are correct and Joe Biden won. Okay good. Now go tell HusbanDaddy to concede and let the country move forward.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaslerNoel @realDonaldTrump If the GOP had an effing spine they would invoke 25th. This is bullshit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone in the @SenateGOP needs to listen to the people who have spoken and tell the President to #Concede  and #SayItToHisFace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VP @EricTrump @IvankaTrump The people have spoken, it is time to do the right thing. #Concede #SayItToHisFace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your voters turned out, there just wasn't enough. #Concede #SayItToHisFace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can we get #ConcedeNow and #SayItToHisFace trending?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Mr. President, you have exhausted all avenues and we have confirmed all preliminary results, unfortunately your numbers are not high enough, it is time to concede for the good of the people."   See? Look how easy it is you SPINELESS weasels. #SayItToHisFace #BidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was that real Melania or Melania number 3 at Arlington? #TrumpIsALaughingStock #TrumpConcede #BidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angela_sherrill It was sickening to watch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm tired but won't back down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Such a shame.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ksorbs for a struggling actor who uses conventions to make money now you are REALLY not doing well with the people who go to conventions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ksorbs The peace treaty was a total surface level farce. It will do nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ksorbs For the record the does not want to unify with you #MAGAts. You spent the last 4 years telling us our skin color, marriage, careers in the arts were all worthless so no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesamsorbo Friendly reminder the media didn't CALL the election they presented the results provided by voting authorities and statisticians like they have EVERY year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ksorbs It's so cute how you act like you still have a career.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emtothea Yeah, it's the landfill of internet users.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@orangepeel18 Today Pompeo is top of the list.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dcexaminer @kayleighmcenany @seanhannity Sworn affidavits like the one recanted earlier? You have NOTHING. YOU LOST!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TitusNation @realDonaldTrump BUt MaIL iN baLLOts!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ZackBornstein @emtothea Those were a sweet 37 minutes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaddCompani @allywalker1 WHAT? Did anyone check on the 8th floor after it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MindTendencies2 You 👏 Owe👏 Your 👏 Abusers 👏 Nothing 👏 ! Now - if it helps in YOUR healing to close a chapter or move on or forgive, okay, but it must be for YOUR healing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edgar_a_bitch I would have to second this No.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bobbyberk I had to lay down the same stance. It was hard but I had no space in my heart for someone who would think my marriage was worth less than the 1% getting helicopter rebates in a tax bill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aeirould @GRobLewis @bubbaprog @mattyglesias Sorry I misunderstood.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aeirould @GRobLewis @bubbaprog @mattyglesias And not to mention how disgusting to take advantage of vulnerable people like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aeirould @GRobLewis @bubbaprog @mattyglesias Oh yeah just speaks to the narrative of WHO is actually committing the fraud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CraigMahlman I about shat too when I read it. Because it is Texas it is FAIR to say which candidate he was rooting for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TitusNation Titus did you see the "witness" project veritas rewarded 25k as a reward recanted? And his gofundme raised 130k. Where have we seen 130k before???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GRobLewis @bubbaprog @mattyglesias Oh and a dude in Texas who registered 134 mentally incapacitated people whose informations he obtained in his role AS A SOCIAL WORKER!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewsfordays @bubbaprog @pattymo The 130k was go fund me but you make an interesting point about the amount. And another 25k as a "reward"? Come on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bridogz @Astrohaus I am so jealous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThePINKlilypad Okay Imma going shopping.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Laura Coats on @CNN expressing the feeling that it is STRANGE to have a president just answer the questions of the media is every journalist right now. #BidenWonDay #BidenTransition #BidenHarris<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BidenWonDay  "How can I say this tactfully?" Something Trump has NEVER considered<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden is ALL class and dignity in this conference. "I hope the President has the sensitivity to realise people are in trouble." Like seriously! Quit your temper tantrum  Donald and help your country.  #BidenWonDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThePINKlilypad Is that a PB&amp;J????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Mr President I look forward to speaking with you."  All class.  #BidenWonDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I'm  letting then know America's  back." Biden to world leaders who have reached out.  #BidenWonDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FANEXPODallas Stargate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDemCoalition I am only a greencard holder so I could not vote but I donated and campaigned for the America I want to live in. I would like a VP that doesn't want me hanged for who I love.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EB2683 How is THIS not being played to every judge so they can all tell Dumps cronies to go to hell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are we pretty convinced now the only reason Dump is pushing this so hard has nothing to do with the result but his need to pay off the campaign debt? #BidenWonDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"FRAUD" And yet EVERY individual that has been investigated or charged with voter fraud did so in Trumps name. Including a woman who used her dead mothers name to fulfil her "dying wish to vote for Trump" FUCK RIGHT OFF. #BidenWonDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@girlsreallyrule Calling for votes 7 days after the election? What? I can't...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@funder #BidenWonDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is time to concede Mr Trump. This is not about your ego or pride, this is about the American people and their decision. Your voter base did not abandon you, but the majority has spoken and spoken legally and fairly. #BidenWonDay #BidenHarris2020 #TrumpConcede<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realCCrump *stares at you in uterus*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElieNYC @warrenbowman Just what in the actual fuck? The REASON it is taking so long to finish counting is because they are verifying mail in ballot to an even HIGHER standard. Your signature off a bit in person, id check on spot. They are calling mail voters to come verify signatures on mail ballots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden has done more work on his first day as President-Elect than Trump did in his first 6 months in office. #DumpTrump #TrumpConcede #BidenHarrisToEndThisNightmare<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EugeneDaniels2 @TitusNation Was this on the same transcript where the judge said "So what is your problem?" to Trumps team when they all said "yes we were allowed in to observe"?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scaramucci @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump No one, NO ONE is crediting Biden with this vaccine. They are crediting him for taking the virus seriously and making it a priority to get it under control. Unlike Trump who said "we'll get 15 cases" "gone by easter" "drink bleach".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@albinokid The best response I saw was "metaphorically aren't we ALL just between a dildo shop and a crematorium" and I tell you the existential crisis was REAL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradleyWhitford @DavidBlue I would have hit the skateboard on my back and died...DAMN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KathyRKath @ddncons @mmpadellan It is absolutely a term of endearment to us. I mean we still make sure to read the room but *shrug* the word comes from an Indian Goddess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TitusNation There are just some things ONLY an Australian accent can do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@auntamylee @thomasrupp10 @KingJames @JimCarrey This is gold 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scottcrates His wonderful Sinatra like croon when he sings on White House open mic nights.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tsmendola I had trouble computing an actual presidential sounding address. It was like someone finally killed the mic after 4 years of feedback.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JessHann @JaneEll28751995 @MeaningfulB @michaelcassel @PatsKarvelas I could be Angelica or Eliza except for a pesky tone deaf problem too 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshgad A basic understanding of how not to die.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonFuhrman @Astrohaus Seething with jealousy. But like in a low key poetry coffee house kinda way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@earpnado Hyatt Regency Pools and Decking most likely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods enjoy your new president, you washed-up hack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Are you working on your concession speech? #YOUREFIRED<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@memilies I am irrationally bothered that the kitchen aid isn't pink...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rulitos_ls @cha0sfriend @Lin_Manuel Yeah...no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr Interference isn't rigging. We never claimed 2016 was rigged. Digital influence however...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaneEll28751995 @MeaningfulB @michaelcassel @PatsKarvelas The Hamilton swings will have 5 or 6 roles learned ready to go on. Swing performers are a special kind of awesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cha0sfriend @Lin_Manuel Us Australians can do many things...rap is NOT one of them lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaelcassel I am unsure how I feel about the Australian accents for this one...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KaiWilliams616 @michaelcassel Basically they are ready to "swing" in at any time for various roles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackhawkKBW Just deal with it. Its over. TRUMP IS GONE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackhawkKBW No independent has "MAGA" in their bio my dude.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackhawkKBW THERE IS NO FUCKING LAPTOP. They didn't even get the right state to plant a fake laptop in and you ALL fell for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackhawkKBW Trump actually being impeached. Because that is all he is. A disgraceful impeached one term president who accomplished nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackhawkKBW The OTHER republican congressional hearing into Hunter Biden that showed no wrong doing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackhawkKBW Bengahzi.  That shit storm over a tragedy because GOP thought it would be the nail in Obama/Clinton and it wasn't<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackhawkKBW Also haven't heard anything much about Hunters laptop? Did it go missing in the mail with the rest of Tucker Carlsons documents?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackhawkKBW Still a false narrative the right pushes. See what I am saying?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackhawkKBW Which in 2o24 would be available to him as Trump would have done 2 terms so no competition. No reason for him to lie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackhawkKBW Of course it did but it did not actually GIVE you video of that because a) that would be illegal child porn b) it is A SKEWED narrative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackhawkKBW Michelle Obama is a man. This one is a favorite of mine. So ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackhawkKBW The entire notion there is voter fraud to the tune of millions to start. Even Chris Christie has said "show proof or we are done" admitting Trump has nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This. Right here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pass it on...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vangsness @HamiltonMusical @MasterKGsa I danced all through WalMart this morning doing my grocery shop, no music, just felt the joy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TitusNation Titus, is it making you as crazy as me that his side keeps saying "the media doesn't call the election!" when it was the same process as EVERY election since TV started...broadcasting?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Except for Biden who received 4.3 million more votes than you AND one the electoral college. Not a landslide, but a clear and true victory.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackhawkKBW P.s no where is he grabbing her chest area. No where.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackhawkKBW No I was proving a point about how anything can be turned into such a false narrative. Like election fraud with no evidence. Though to be fair Trump is on camera sexualising his own daughter several times. BTW Biden is still your new president!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Fuck Your Feelings crowd sure are showing a hell of a lot of feelings again this morning. #BidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackhawkKBW @ABC ...its Sunday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackhawkKBW Well now you are just making stuff up. Again, enjoy your new president!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackhawkKBW @ABC Nope. Just like Trump was a legitimate all be it terrible president. Biden is your new president. Enjoy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackhawkKBW It's called statute of limitations unfortunately.  And Trump has done nothing for those communities he has just taken credit for the work of others, like the HBC funding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackhawkKBW @ABC Say whatever you want. Biden is still YOUR PRESIDENT!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tee62253 wimp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tee62253 That's  your answer? Ha! Can't take the heat. He lost. He is gone. HE'S FIRED! BUH BYE!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackhawkKBW @ABC And Joe got nearly 5 million over that. He LOST. Number 2. No longer the president. Buh bye!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackhawkKBW @ABC 1. Nice way to just shit patriarchy there. 2 Nothing remotely evident he is a pedo. 3. Your boy has 26 rape charges. He won't provide his DNA for exoneration. His own wife gave sworn testimony he attacked her. 4. Saying KH slept to the top is so CLICHE damn try harder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr Same way there wasn't any in 2016. We didn't turn up to polling stations with guns and fake ballots either like you #MAGAts did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HartHanson They really deserve a footnote or a park bench or something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSchubert57 @JoeBiden Impeach...over getting voted for? Do you even know what impeachment is?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSchubert57 @JoeBiden Sure thing my dude, enjoy the next 4 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HKrassenstein Cos they probably paid for it first. You know...like you do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaketapper I'm gonna need that number...for a serious tip of course.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@audreyalison Haven't heard from them...don't really want to either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pagetpaget I... don't think this tweet came across the way you intended Paget.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@romansdegare When I tell you I am making this into a poster, calendar, sweatshirt, throw blanket and flag...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KateDrummond_ I am Australian, I lived abroad in Canada for nearly a decade before moving to the US 3 years ago, tonight was the last piece to click into place to make this feel like my forever home. We spent the last 2 years scared our marriage would be overturned and I would have to leave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am going to need daily speeches from these two please and thank you. #BidenHarris2020 #Election2020 #ByeByeTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*Bible....damn it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fifail It's been so long...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden ACTUALLY being a Christian not posing for a photo op with a people. #BidenHarris2020 #Election2020 #SpreadTheFaith<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden straight up calling it that black voters got him here is ALL the honesty I need to know that while we have shit to do, we are gonna get shit done! #BidenHarris2020 #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KateDrummond_ I am already stanning her SO DAMN HARD!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Katiew552 I am LIVING for Kamala's suit. Just *chef's kiss*.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kristylellison Tweet of the day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tee62253 No, I am saying the Trump team has no EVIDENCE. Each state already has dismissed all lawsuits and all state election officials are providing evidence they are doing everything legally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tee62253 There is no evidence. Hence EVERY case has already been tossed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tee62253 The statisticians and election officials beg to differ.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ruffdood @DrBiden Enjoy the next four years!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Momof8NewMexico @philiptirino @ChuckCallesto May God bless out NEW PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN! Told you they all lied to you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tee62253 Well, this aged well didn't it! Enjoy the next 4 years!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TonyAlberni No...they didn't actually. Trump supporters today however have turned up to counting centers with guns, forced an innocent poll worker into hiding and are threatening civil war...so...try again snowflake. #HeISYourPresident<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarolLa58323696 @DonaldJTrumpJr Yes, you will snowflake. Just like we all put up with Dump for 4 years,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSchubert57 @JoeBiden Impeach over what? Idiot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Audrey24509686 Impeach for what? Idiot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dhar8352 @realDonaldTrump Nah love, sorry, it's done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aadrianc02 Actually yeah he is, and will be for at least 4 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Katiew552 Yes, always. I just downed an impossible whopper and am considering a family bag of skittles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ianbremmer Like how about absolutely the fuck not?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ilmeeyat Ha! Like he would take Eric.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WildlifeWarrio9 Wow what a way to ruin a wedding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmaranoTony @realDonaldTrump The EC has never in it's history voted against the the result. Even in 2016 when the popular vote was different. This is it folks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AimeeS_523 Hahahaha not our president any more!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I must second this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveOsunsami No. I am celebrating because of how Trumpers have acted the last 4 years. They can all go bite it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissKristanRose @u3BringTogether @NPR No, no he didnt. He is president because he won the EC jurisdictions. That is WHY he is president.  The official EC vote in December backed him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissKristanRose @u3BringTogether @NPR At the end of the day, the EC has never over turned a result. Biden not only has the popular vote but also the EC count. The states will send the reps to back him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@u3BringTogether @MissKristanRose @NPR Thank you! It's like this is hard to google or something!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissKristanRose @NPR Okay so you're nuts. Good day. Please research how the electoral college works.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissKristanRose @NPR No it is. The states send people know will vote in line. The Dec EC vote is pure pomp. It's  the tradition. It won't over turn todays result.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissKristanRose @NPR Oh yeah it is a flawed system. But 2016 was still held up. At least this one the EC and popular vote are the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissKristanRose @NPR Also the part where faithless electors can be replaced if they go against the state. The EC vote is tradition. It means nothing. Biden won. Deal with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@David_Boreanaz @HartHanson Okay this is even funnier now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissKristanRose @NPR Yes did you get to the part that says most states have precautions to stop faithless electors and not once has the electoral college changed the state vote?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@byetrumpbyegop @JT19134 @CPTDoomDC @kathygriffin No. They don't.  They aren't just saying "eh call it" they have teams of statisticians doing the math. The SAME WAY 2016 WAS CALLED.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes this right here is the thing. #bidenharis2020 #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JennaEllisEsq You mean the same way EVERY election since TV was invented has been announced??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JennaEllisEsq Now now, as 2016 said "he won fair and square, deal with it."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@methamorphesis @emacastillozam @JeanMcB01916866 @JennaEllisEsq I'm framing this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@livesmattershow You mean the SAME electoral college Trump was demanding be abolished in 2014? The technicality he then jumped on board with when he won? Get fucked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emtothea But WHICH Melania is it?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MarthaW32412828 1. The dead name list is fake/debunked. 2. The people filling out ballots were refilling damged ballots that would not feed into the machine. 3. All polling places WERE granting access. Trump's lawyer had to admit in court this morning they were granted access. OAN is not news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarthaW32412828 HA! OAN. Really?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angela_sherrill Teehee true that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xCHAMPiOWNSx And I am agreeing with you. And I believe the other counties that used it did cross check and make sure the update responsible was installed so it didn't happen again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stephryansays @themodalice The research nerds do what we can 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xCHAMPiOWNSx I'd seen it earlier. Again not disagree the software should be verified.  But again no evidence of the fraud Trump is claiming he will take to court.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is #Trump just going to stand in the Oval Office like a #Karen refusing to admit his presidential coupon has expired? #Election2020results #bidenharis2020 #ByeByeTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xCHAMPiOWNSx That was not fraud. It was a glitch that was rectified almost immediately.  It was debunked as "fraud". My "should" referred to the "millions of illegals ballots" that Trump has said. Like he did in 2016. The call to check dominion is valid and I thought they had done that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@James_Monroe_17  https://t.co/3ih3a4pBgY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@themodalice Fact check  https://t.co/hHenKvhn06<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@h_zlee @themodalice It's already been disproven.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@themodalice  https://t.co/3ih3a4pBgY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xCHAMPiOWNSx Yes it CAN occur. And any credible instances SHOULD be investigated. However, there is no evidence of the fraud the GOP is implying. That is the problem. It is all grandstanding, failing to realize states counted in person first and democrats surged in legal mail ballots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xCHAMPiOWNSx It didn't happen in the way it is being shared.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xCHAMPiOWNSx  https://t.co/3PSs0MGUJX<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Thompson_airyz Yup I sure did because you are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Thompson_airyz @KirkWrites79 I don't have feelings about trash actually. I just take it out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Thompson_airyz @KirkWrites79 Yup. My own college and my own phone bill since I was 17. But sound off on you "scholarships". 🤣🤣🤣😍😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Thompson_airyz @KirkWrites79 I paid for my own college, but nice try.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Zeshless @ksorbs I agree. And I only ask because I am seeing this being used as smoking gun evidence that democrats are cheating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zeshless @ksorbs So you are equally outraged by the two people who have ACTUALLY  been caught voting for Trump under their dead mother's name? Correct?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zeshless @ksorbs There is no party indicated, no proof the ballot was counted, and you don't think it is a LITTLE convenient this randomly generated name was discovered? This is someone intentionally sewing doubt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zeshless @ksorbs Look at those images. The ballot image does not have his name on it. Clearly an image manipulation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zeshless @ksorbs These images do not link the DEAD person to the ballot. Look at them carefully. This is such an easy set of images to generate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ksorbs The ONLY 2 people caught and investigated for using a dead name to vote BOTH used their deads mothers names to vote Trump. No evidence of democrat side.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@amymarieot @DrBiden I WANT it to be fear mongering. And honestly until the two justices released their statements saying they believed the ruling to be overturned I wasn't concerned. But now if a case comes before them, there is the chance it could happen with a 6-3 split.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@connellycr74 @DrBiden He and Pence are both anti-lgbt. Pence "wants us all hanged" as Trump said on camera and banning trans soldiers is not  supporting the LGBT community.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonnaBr24153956 @cretin_the @DrBiden Marriage equality was granted by SCOTUS. And two justices have come out saying this decision should be overturned. They are waiting for a case to come before them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@promotedebate @DrBiden Last I checked Pope had no jurisdiction over US politics. But the two justice who want to overturn marriage equality do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@divaofsteel @DrBiden I used to say that. I only became concerned when two SCOTUS released statements this month saying they feel the ruling should be overturned. That is groundwork. And Pence is adamantly against LGBT rights too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CraigCrable @DrBiden No but I read the statements of two SCOTUS saying they believe the decision should be overturned so, yeah, there is groundwork being set.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cretin_the @DrBiden Like it LITERALLY was.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kayleig25645316 @DrBiden That's like saying "I'm not racist I know a black person" it means nothing. Actions. His ban on trans military is how he feels about the LGBT community. Joking on camera the VP would "hang them all" about gay people. That is how this administration feels about the LGBT community.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cana0607Cana @Kayleig25645316 @DrBiden Only 20k? This seems like an outdated graphic.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PromographicKen @swissch33z @TitusNation @JoeBiden Not when the candidates are not established. And as I said in this particular election I agree with what the democratic party is planning. You are just ignorant to the fact that "just vote for them" doesn't work and isn't enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PromographicKen @swissch33z @TitusNation @JoeBiden As someone who voted outside the two party system in my own country for 15 years before coming here, I assure you I am not pretending.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PromographicKen @swissch33z @TitusNation @JoeBiden Because that's worked so far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PromographicKen @swissch33z @TitusNation @JoeBiden No, state, federal, and local governments need to legitimize the candidates. AND Not allow a list of 40+ names. You can't bitch about the system and say "just don't vote for them" when that strategy doesn't work and lets people like Trump win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaslerNoel @realDonaldTrump OR Melania's immigration paperwork...how she qualified for an EO1 should be what is investigated by ICE.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PromographicKen @swissch33z @TitusNation @JoeBiden I am supporting the candidate I want to support. I am trying to respectfully engage and I am agreeing with you in theory, but you are still treating me like garbage and being rude so I think you should just move on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PromographicKen @swissch33z @TitusNation @JoeBiden No, it's a country that can't move from the two party system. I am not the media not supporting/covering them. I am not other levels of government not giving them a seat at the table. An independent ain't taking 271 seats 10 days before the election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PromographicKen @swissch33z @TitusNation @JoeBiden Because no work has been done to change it! And that ain't my fault. You talk to me like I am personally responsible for no independent having a shot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PromographicKen @swissch33z @TitusNation @JoeBiden No. I personally am not. I agree with most of the democratic policies. I am happy with the Biden Harris ticket. But NOT voting means you don't get to bitch and moan. And it is not my fault people won't embrace voting independents. But that change has to start above voters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thisisamy_ @edgar_a_bitch I have come across business' that have said to me "oh we can't take a landline number" like...really?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomKingTK Hi fren!  https://t.co/LVPCd0Xycy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@swissch33z @PromographicKen @TitusNation @JoeBiden In terms of this election it is the truth, Cheese. Trump has a proven voter base,  not voting at all is more beneficial to him than Biden. I'm sorry you don't understand concepts more complex than a sandwich.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PromographicKen @swissch33z @TitusNation @JoeBiden Okay so if it is that easy then why are they not getting elected?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PromographicKen @swissch33z @TitusNation @JoeBiden First US election that is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PromographicKen @swissch33z @TitusNation @JoeBiden Again not disagreeing. And this is my first election so I can't speak to my opinion of previous ones. But what would you do to give independent candidates more legitimate chances?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PromographicKen @swissch33z @TitusNation @JoeBiden No. I fundamentally disagree with the majority of republican policy, again I am NOT disagreeing that the two party system sucks. But at the moment removing Trump is my top concern.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@swissch33z @PromographicKen @TitusNation @JoeBiden It's not about math it's a matter of complacency, Cheese.  More holes in your tweet than in a piece of you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BadassMomWriter We discussed something similar yesterday. I have a lost a fundamental piece of my motivation that I don't know how to find again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaslerNoel @realDonaldTrump Dude the phrase "horny MAGA nuns" will haunt my dreams.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PromographicKen @TitusNation @JoeBiden Hey I am not disagreeing with you. But 4 more years of Trump is still worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PromographicKen @TitusNation @JoeBiden We are decades, maybe generations from breaking down the two party system, if at all possible. Now I agree that voting independent is the very thing I said about first steps but unfortunately will not work in this election. Step one must be remove Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillSelznick @TitusNation @JoeBiden I've never let myself think of that before. My mid-morning earl grey...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TitusNation @JoeBiden And most foods are allowed a small amount of insects so...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PromographicKen @TitusNation @JoeBiden That's a vote for Trump right there. This vote isn't an undying declaration of love to a candidate, it's the first step to the community YOU want. Change won't come by doing nothing. Even if the first steps are rough. #VoteBiden<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SteveGuest @realDonaldTrump And by "it" I mean the oil industry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveGuest @realDonaldTrump Oil is a fossil fuel...literally can't be replaced at the rate we are using it. We NEED to transition out of it. But you say that like it would just disappear over night. It wouldn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact that Trump thinks referring to the people he is MEANT to be serving the American people with in such disrespectful terms like AOC+3 is what a leader does, is disgusting. #debates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@larryelder Well actually...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scrowder No no BIDEN was on the right side of the screen honey.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump looked like he needed to poop the whole time. #debates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jlhw108 @POTUS @JoeBiden @EricTrump He very honestly has said " on federal land" he has never denied it. You need to listen to the whole thing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SeanFisher69 No he didn't. There is video of this very account.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cmartinezTX I appreciate Joe straight up saying "we took too long and messed up."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OOO I had "disaster" on my bingo card. #Debates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The "cages" we're for unaccomanied minors and ultimately never used. Democrats have never denied the policy existed but there were NO BABIES IN CAGES during the Obama administration #Debates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lilith_Fannibal He needs to poop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SanityForAll @kwelkernbc He is once again respecting her and the time. Trump is shitting all over the floor screaming at her to smell it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fours years for the taxes. Four years for Melania immigration papers. Four years for a healthcare plan. Four years and still not great. Fucking cry baby Trump. #Debates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BidenCare sounds good to me. #Debates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You said you HAD the health care plan already? Where is it? If it is so good why not put it forward Trump? #Debates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is bull shit MUTE his Mic damn it. Trump is definitely coming unhinged. #Debates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UpAndUpAgain Thinking the same thing. I wish they were addressing different issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay every time a republican says how much Hunter Biden made from Burisma they add a zero. It was 30k a month now it's 187k a month. GTFO #Debates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toyatherose Every piece of MAGA shit is made in China.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just because you say "you do" doesn't make it true Trump. #Debates2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Vertdad51501 @MUSA_ASTRAIA @no_silenced I think you have been duped my friend. The kids were born way before the campaign started. No one cared she was pregnant then, no public photos. And if you listen to her talk about her menopause, no man is that good an actor.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realoffright @JuliaGr38449216 @MUSA_ASTRAIA @no_silenced She did several nude spreads. Like the photo above.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vertdad51501 @MUSA_ASTRAIA @no_silenced There is absolutely no credible, real, or factual evidence to base this on. Alex Jones, the same man who claimed his toothpaste cured Covid-19, started the rumor.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JuliaGr38449216 @MUSA_ASTRAIA @no_silenced OH and...like who I know matters BUT several of my college professors were in fact multilingual so...yeah I do know people who can speak that many languages. Because apparently you think that means something 🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaGr38449216 @MUSA_ASTRAIA @no_silenced 1. She has NEVER spoken on camera in any of the languages she claims to know. Look for it. 2.

<|startoftext|>@JuliaGr38449216 @MUSA_ASTRAIA @no_silenced Oh geeze pic a new song this ones OOOLLLLLDDDD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaGr38449216 @MUSA_ASTRAIA @no_silenced Ah yes, because she has not publicly displayed her vagina - unlike the current first "lady"  - Michelle Obama must be trans. Nice logic there.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@magsbestfriend @beardomike @Zac_Petkanas @jkfecke You want to know why there is nothing about Hunder Biden and sex trafficking? Because it didn't happen. And I am done engaging with someone who is obviously brainwashed by Fux News.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@magsbestfriend @beardomike @Zac_Petkanas @jkfecke And WHERE are your facts for this? EVERY account is highlighting the same key points. He believed she was 15, he believed it was a genuine interview. He is a pedo.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@magsbestfriend @beardomike @Zac_Petkanas @jkfecke That is...not how this movie works. Rudy had no idea he was on film and he attempted to sexually assault someone he believed was a 15-year-old child.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emileelee I don't think anyone is surprised Rudy is a pedo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TitusNation Also not voting for the guy whose wife gave a sworn statement he raped her after a botched plastic surgery job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkRuffalo @prattprattpratt THAT is the thinking and behavior Pratt is ultimately condoning by remaining aligned with the current republican party and that church.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkRuffalo @prattprattpratt But deciding racism and homophobia isn't a deal breaker IS putting your class privilege above marginalized groups. If someone had said privately on ANY Marvel set "why'd they have to hire a black guy?" That would be a deal breaker. Right? Would you not condemn that thinking?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Theresa56243016 @Elizabeth_8787 @VixenAccidental @JoeBiden He addressed racism in several ways including admitting the 94 bill was a mistake.

<|startoftext|>@friendlyreaper1 @Theresa56243016 @VixenAccidental @JoeBiden I think the answer was clear, it was just much deeper than they both realized which is why he offered to talk more. And in terms of being treated, I think they were treated the way they deserved.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@friendlyreaper1 @Theresa56243016 @VixenAccidental @JoeBiden He did. But he did a deep dive into that answer which  is why he also said "we will keep talking later".<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Coffeeclutch20 @RandyDarsh350 @JoeBiden And your first line here shows all anyone needs to know "not relevant to me" does not mean anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Coffeeclutch20 @RandyDarsh350 @JoeBiden Have a master's degree in communications and work for the state so it is serving me pretty dang well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Coffeeclutch20 @RandyDarsh350 @JoeBiden Every country is still counting comorbidity because Covid brought about death. Not the comorbidity. Read the paragraph under what you circled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever @Vangsness Of course @Vangsness likes your tweet and not your wife's.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Coffeeclutch20 @RandyDarsh350 @JoeBiden Bye Felicia, go learn how to read.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Coffeeclutch20 @RandyDarsh350 @JoeBiden YES THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I JUST SAID. That does not mean that the other 94% were going to die as well. There deaths are still attributed to covid because it killed them. Read the whole thing and understand what it means.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Coffeeclutch20 @RandyDarsh350 @JoeBiden Yup you are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Coffeeclutch20 @RandyDarsh350 @JoeBiden Swine flu death on 60 million cases was just under 13k. The severity was nothing compared to Covid19. It is a false equivalency. I suggest you turn off fox news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Coffeeclutch20 @RandyDarsh350 @JoeBiden  https://t.co/OVaVV2E65u  Comorbidity has not changed the death toll. As those people would/could still be alive if not for contracting covid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Coffeeclutch20 @RandyDarsh350 @JoeBiden Okay you're  a fool. Good to know. There is no way to dispute the US death toll due to Covid 19 is higher than every other nation, but also adjusted for population is egregiously higher and it is because of a lack of response from this administration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Coffeeclutch20 @RandyDarsh350 @JoeBiden Okay you're not getting it. Tests aren't counted multiple times. Positive tests are recorded once. And people only die ONCE. US deaths for our population compared to another countries is a record of the mishandling of this pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Coffeeclutch20 @RandyDarsh350 @JoeBiden Wow. No, nothing of that makes sense. Australia was testing individuals well before the US in mass numbers. Not testing does not mean the infections aren't there. That's like saying we would not have as many births if we didn't do pregnancy tests.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TitusNation Now now Titus, he is also very, very good at not telling the truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeepAmericaFre4 @JoeBiden If that 15k people died with strict adherence to guidelines, and was in line with health professionals AND mathematically compatible in terms of population adjustments to other nations, no, we wouldn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandyDarsh350 @JoeBiden Adjusting for population the US is still a staggeringly high percentage of deaths to infections.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandyDarsh350 @JoeBiden No one is saying "no one would have died" with another president. The point is to look at other countries like New Zealand, Australia, South Korea, and others whose strict measures have prevented similar numbers. Mask mandates, border closures, travel restrictions all worked.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@uche_blackstock @TitusNation @MSNBC @CNN Yeah for real this person does not get to have their identity protected when they are condoning genocide so go ahead and name this special little piece.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chipfranklin Ivanka and all her friends.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBCMarie @CBCAlerts @CBCNews The lines to #VoteBidenHarris in GA today were longer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KimberlyEllen93 yup, figured you take the cowards way and block when you know you are wrong. Bye kid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KimberlyEllen93 Well luckily we are not talking about infanticide, we are talking about abortion. 2 very different things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baimcpher Just take your engagement fishing and go. Abortion is healthcare.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KimberlyEllen93 1. It's not ending an innocent life. It's a life when it can live outside the uterus. 2. If you don't believe abortion, fine, don't have one, but the only uterus you have a say in is your own. Not your body, not your business.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WipeHomophobia When I tell you I snorted like Trump with Adderall in front of him...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KimberlyEllen93 Yes!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#VoteBiden because he doesn't want to take away civil rights.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LauraJeanTruman We are adding "...if we are still married." as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kosmokittie @GeorgeTakei Right? Like WHERE are they getting this from? A mother having to induce labor because she is dying is NOT her choosing to not be pregnant anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenDavisCP This photo points out EXACTLY what pro choice people want. Greater resources for adoptions and foster care for children currently in the system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On this #NationalComingOutDay I take this opportunity to not only celebrate my soul mate but also to remind everyone that my marriage as a civil right should not be up for debate. #VoteBlue #BidenHarris2020 #BidensUnitingUS  https://t.co/hTjBzM3nuK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeTakei Except this is predicated on an ultimate falsehood - that Trump would donate. He is a fundamentally selfish self serving narcissist.  Donating does not benefit him, therefore he won't do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FANEXPODallas The heart attack would make sure I didn't have to do anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnBarrowman All of that and daddy still doesn't love them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AviQuijada Well congrats!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AviQuijada you're moving to Hawaii??? That's so cool!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lesbiyinzer Just snorted like a hog.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris can we skip to the part where y'all are doing your thing, people aren't dying, women still control their bodies and gay people don't have to worry about waking up spontaneously not married? That'd be great. Thanks. #BidensUnitingUS #BidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>For all those who regularly suck Tr*mps d*** he DID NOT WIN the #NobelPeacePrize there is NO proof he was actually nominated or his nomination was accepted and there is NO proof he is nominated next year. So suck it #MAGAts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@firemanscott6 @KaivanShroff Well credible, maybe, but again. No way to prove the nomination is real OR accepted by the committee so about you research before tweeting? God you Trumpy culters make me sick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@firemanscott6 @KaivanShroff So you're wrong without even trying. Anything else #MAGAt ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@firemanscott6 @RossyOnTheMic @realDonaldTrump ONE Australian professor has claimed to have nominated him for next year but again, NO way to prove that and the Nobel committee does not confirm nominations for 50 years.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@firemanscott6 @KaivanShroff Which website? Who's website? The Nobel?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnnaokBelle @KaivanShroff Maybe not. Nominations are never revealed by the committee officially. Anyone could say the nominated him to stoke his sick ego.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@firemanscott6 @KaivanShroff He may NEVER have been actually nominated. Nominations and shortlisted are not revealed for 50 years. So you think some crappy people trying to buy his friendship wouldn't say "oh yeah...I monimated you...yeah" with no way to prove it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChipWideopen @Soypanaa @KaivanShroff And he may NEVER have been actually nominated. Nominations and shortlisted are not revealed for 50 years.

<|startoftext|>Look I would never want to say I don't believe abuse victims of any gender or not blame both parties if they were toxic but objectively speaking, this timing is suspicious and there are SERIOUS allegations in there I can't imagine would not be investigated #istandwithmelissa<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TaylorCtaylor67 @RealOmarNavarro And for the record all international and interstate travel should have been halted in Feb to avoid Trump killing the 200000 people he did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaylorCtaylor67 @RealOmarNavarro He never specified the China travel closures. And Biden never called them xenophobic as he stated. He made a false equivalency to the swine flu and his argument was debunked. His month 9 abortion comment was wrong to point of offensive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NuevoMiramon Cos, not? Pointing out a failed stolen gag doesn't mean I'm agitated just means you stole a gag. So cool?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TaylorCtaylor67 @RealOmarNavarro No you're done because you're wrong and can't take it, geeze you trump culters are something else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaylorCtaylor67 @RealOmarNavarro You're  obviously the one that didn't read them. They both outlined several times he was false. And Kamala's worst was inconclusive or did not answer. Fucking Trumpers literally cant even take facts in front of them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NuevoMiramon Dude this joke is old, a week old, from when it was done to cover Trump's face in the first debate. But I should know better than to expect anything original from a #MAGAt  #BidenHarris #BidenHarrisToSaveAmerica #FuckTrump #TrumpIsARacist #TrumpIsARapist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alwayscurious66 @karentravers I've wondered if 2 debates should be at the beginning of the campaign season as opposed to now with both parties needing to commit to a candidate say minimum 8 months in advance.Then the final at this point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hazzeleys @RealOmarNavarro But every independent fact checker has shown that Pence lied on all his major points and she...didn't? There is no other way to interpret it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hazzeleys @RealOmarNavarro Everything has been fact checked. She Pence lied on every major point. She did not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealOmarNavarro Everything Pence said has been independently fact checked as a lie so...try again?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chriswisco12 @aholmes5 @IlhanMN Okay so by my "every" question comment I guess I meant I understood the dissent. But I agree they both should of said there are too many variables to make that call now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shelby60235316 @Cathy49955245 @nytimes I agree with transparency. But the strategy is more a case of there being too many variables right now to make the call. Amy may not get appointed. Trump could win or lose. The court could act in its duty and judge fairly and not need anyone. Who knows.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThaShitta @jsayner @nytimes Exactly. It's strategy. They say yes or no now they are going to cause an unnecessary shit storm. Amy may not get through. Trump may win. Trump may lose. Too many variables to decide which is why the appointment of RBG replacement should wait.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TitusNation That beat of silence after he finishes is the loudest FUUUUUUCCCCCCCKKKK I have ever heard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chriswisco12 @aholmes5 @IlhanMN But if they answer now, yes or no, then change their minds that will be worse. It's just strategy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Um no? That is not what was said at all? And you killed over 200k people this year so we know exactly how you feel about the sanctity of life.

<|startoftext|>@MegBonneyWriter 1/2 Mitchum wasn't wrong about Rory. Seemed to get on track but never became what she wanted. And she should have been pregnant from the end of p1 of the reboot writing the book as a way to deal with her going to be a single mom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDannyMorgan @NOH8Campaign And it is so infuriating that you are correct and it is just...fine? Like I have a moral objection to cilantro in my food, I'm not over here trying to get Chipotle shut down!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NOH8Campaign So...where is the religiously liberty in FORCING me to live by your religious beliefs? The religious argument is invalid as marriage is a tax status not a religious ritual. You don't have to be of any religion to get married so how is it fair this argument can have SCOTUS merit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At this point, Trump could walk down a line and spit in the mouths of all of his #MAGAts and they would claim he vaccinated them. I fucking hate this guy. #TrumpHasToGo #BidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthFLTropics @getliquidized @AndrewFeinberg @realDonaldTrump No. Look at countries like Australia, New Zealand, South Korea. When you adjust all figures for population size the US still has the worst fatality rate and it could have been avoided. He failed he lied and 200k people died. That will be his legacy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthFLTropics @getliquidized @AndrewFeinberg @realDonaldTrump His mismanagement and intentional downplay crushed our hospital system and depleted resources before we were even in the worst of it. And let's not forget him rolling back President Obamas pandemic response out of sheer spite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthFLTropics @getliquidized @AndrewFeinberg @realDonaldTrump The same measures countries like Australia and New Zealand took that has helped prevent unnecessary spread and death.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthFLTropics @getliquidized @AndrewFeinberg @realDonaldTrump Federal mask mandate, totally closed interstate travel, tighter restricted gatherings and extended closures and then you know, not hold ppe hostage or encourage my constituents to act against science.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthFLTropics @getliquidized @AndrewFeinberg @realDonaldTrump Well he wasn't very nice to 200k people he let die so...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getliquidized @AndrewFeinberg @realDonaldTrump You are nuts. And no...we absolutely do not *gag* love *gag* them. I don't want them to die but I want to see Trump clinging to life on a ventilator so he learns a damn lesson.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Girasol_Mary I think it is a complex situation. But I have regularly seen "regular" women do this. It helps to be open with grief for some. But as a celebrity, she owned her story and told it on her terms, save some vermin at the hospital leaking it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LauraJeanTruman I genuinely pray that Melania gets Barron away from all of it. It is too late for the others, but he is a child.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ralph_Bot Really? Really? Wow. But to clarify your heteronormative whitewashed vision, I have a wonderful wife.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricTrump Don't try and write that cheque ET, neither your corrupt business dealings, your fraudulant charitable foundation or multiple times bankrupt rather can cash it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ralph_Bot @workfromhome63 @Hqdepot1 @LizRNC @DonaldJTrumpJr I don't have a husband so...no?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffreeStar This would help me after being furloughed and ending up in the hospital. Thank you, for the kindness, whomever you should give it too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ralph_Bot @workfromhome63 @Hqdepot1 @LizRNC @DonaldJTrumpJr Sent you the CDC link too boo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ralph_Bot @workfromhome63 @Hqdepot1 @LizRNC @DonaldJTrumpJr  https://t.co/VcLGhN01YA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ralph_Bot @workfromhome63 @Hqdepot1 @LizRNC @DonaldJTrumpJr I know....I can read. Unlike you it seems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ralph_Bot @workfromhome63 @Hqdepot1 @LizRNC @DonaldJTrumpJr  https://t.co/cefSnT9Kvs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ralph_Bot @workfromhome63 @Hqdepot1 @LizRNC @DonaldJTrumpJr And how, how exactly is banning trans soldiers good? Captain Bone Spur was too much of a coward himself to serve and the policy was largely condemned because it was the definition of prejudice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ralph_Bot @workfromhome63 @Hqdepot1 @LizRNC @DonaldJTrumpJr He did not react quickly. He did not react at all. He is on tape saying he intentionally lied. If he had of acted we would not have lost 200k people. Jesus you are blind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ralph_Bot @workfromhome63 @Hqdepot1 @LizRNC @DonaldJTrumpJr Okay the fact you think those policies are good tells me all about your character I need to know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@workfromhome63 @Ralph_Bot @Hqdepot1 @LizRNC @DonaldJTrumpJr Right? And I'm an Australian/ American moderate married to a Texan and WE still see it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ralph_Bot @workfromhome63 @Hqdepot1 @LizRNC @DonaldJTrumpJr Your Fox News version of things. The wall, the roll back of DACA, the trans ban, the family separations, the muslim travel ban is just the tip of his racist, prejudice iceberg. #BidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ralph_Bot @workfromhome63 @Hqdepot1 @LizRNC @DonaldJTrumpJr Cool story bro. But a great president is great for everyone. He has actively marginalized minorities and done nothing but make rich white guys richer. You're in his cult. There is sadly no hope for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ralph_Bot @workfromhome63 @Hqdepot1 @LizRNC @DonaldJTrumpJr The so called greatest economy that Trump built was a house of cards that collapsed at the first real test of it. The pandemic. He has destroyed this country and to not see that is just willfully ignorant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ralph_Bot @workfromhome63 @Hqdepot1 @LizRNC @DonaldJTrumpJr No. That's not what I am saying. Direct measures like the ACA, DACA (or an executive order to ban soldiers brave enough to serve when Trump himself wasn't) are not the same as steady job growth that is a result of years of repair that Obama did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Republicans are losing their shit because their own enquiry into Hunter Biden showed nothing and the media won't play into Dumps narrative anymore. #BidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ralph_Bot @workfromhome63 @Hqdepot1 @LizRNC @DonaldJTrumpJr No, that's how it absolutely works. EVERY president for the majority of their first term is the victim or beneficiary of the person before. And that is not just the US. Policies take years to show their true effects.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ralph_Bot @workfromhome63 @Hqdepot1 @LizRNC @DonaldJTrumpJr Oh Ralph. None of that is true. Trump used his privilege to ban Trans soldiers. 2017/8 figures were run off from Obama. He disbanded a pandemic response, ignored and lied about it and killed over 200k people. He has put us into record debt. In his words he is a disaster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrentButler @ZachWahls Yup, claiming the wage of an employee and the tools they need. Travel etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaddCompani @allywalker1 @JoeBiden This would be glorious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeKobolds @Davidlaz He probably claimed the wage of the poor soul who has to touch that monstrous comb over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xxnavygirl @realDonaldTrump Oh geeze I could have gone without seeing what he looks like straining on the toilet...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever @ThrillingAdv Twas the best part.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever @pagetpaget @NathanFillion I am going to need them in a movie as brother and sister.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shenpasister @RealEricAdamcik @JulieGunnigle I have purposely avoided calling her that for that very reason. Undeserved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tetesavane @ASparklyWTF @JulieGunnigle @valeries86 Agree with that list. Electoral college can go soon enough but let's get that list done!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lormac53 @twostep87 @derektmuller @hughhewitt They blocked Garland because they knew he would swing the votes and get elected. This nomination or vote should not occur until after the election. If Trump is reelected then so be it. But fair is fair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay so how, legitimately, do we attempt to stop the #SCOTUS nominee going through until after the election. The GOP can do this if Trump is reelected but we MUST hold them to their own precedent until after election results.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Snugglehugger @Camirenee1797 @Jbarkerjune @RonWaxman @cnnbrk It would also amplify the call that most pro choice groups advocate for, that foster and adoption services need to be funded better and no restrictions on LGBT couples.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Snugglehugger @Camirenee1797 @Jbarkerjune @RonWaxman @cnnbrk Well in theory, that does not need to change abortion laws. Its an option to remove the psychological trauma of a rape victim carrying to term but does not want to terminate. In the case of equal parenting, dad would have to agree to be the primary if mother wants to terminate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@faeriewater @Snugglehugger @Camirenee1797 @Jbarkerjune @RonWaxman @cnnbrk Thank you! I was like..artifical? Well that will solve a whole lot of fertility problems for folks so...yay?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheTwittiestOne @SusanMo40897147 @tj_bedders @X2_T17 @GoJackFlynn @realDonaldTrump I'm good thanks. Again, practice what you preach. Your proving the hypocritical right narrative with every tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheTwittiestOne @SusanMo40897147 @tj_bedders @X2_T17 @GoJackFlynn @realDonaldTrump "Less chat" says the person who inserted themselves into a conversation 12 hours later to just get their 2 cents in. How about you practice what you preach friend. Good day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheTwittiestOne @SusanMo40897147 @tj_bedders @X2_T17 @GoJackFlynn @realDonaldTrump I was then accosted by someone who was incredibly rude and hostile so I responded in kind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheTwittiestOne @SusanMo40897147 @tj_bedders @X2_T17 @GoJackFlynn @realDonaldTrump 1. I'm not talking to him. If I was. I would address him as such. 2. There is no law that says you must refer to them as such, using their last names is common colloquial speech. 3. Look at my original tweet, which you liked I was respectful and put Biden and Trump in equal tone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheTwittiestOne @SusanMo40897147 @tj_bedders @X2_T17 @GoJackFlynn @realDonaldTrump If you look back you will see that I am very respectful to people I engage with. If they show me the same courtesy then it continues. Respect is earned not guaranteed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grendeg1 @JonathanMcface @junzhang923 @AdrianaPalmier1 @MartinRich91 @Jbarkerjune @RonWaxman @cnnbrk And by substituting RBG for Amy Barrett that vote is 5-4 in favour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Snugglehugger @Camirenee1797 @Jbarkerjune @RonWaxman @cnnbrk Ok I am going to ignore your opening tone and engage with you respectfully. My first question would be what scenario are you implying. Parents use an AW to get pregnant then change their mind? Or the baby is diagnosed with a genetic condition?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcusAgricola @truth_mmatters @X2_T17 @realDonaldTrump That is... literally proof he did it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@back452020 @Camirenee1797 @Jbarkerjune @RonWaxman @cnnbrk When apes  have the capacity to understand being raped by a relative and getting pregnant, come talk to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcusAgricola @truth_mmatters @X2_T17 @realDonaldTrump I have seen it. And I have read about it. I do try and analyse as much as I can. I don't buy the "I do it all the time" defense because he doesn't. And I am the first to say I don't care how DJT picks up a water glass or attack petty crap like the way he stands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcusAgricola @truth_mmatters @X2_T17 @realDonaldTrump Your defense is that his mockery was not accurate enough? Oh come on. If he had been tapping his own head or clicking his fingers....okay...that curled fist was a direct impersonation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@back452020 @Camirenee1797 @Jbarkerjune @RonWaxman @cnnbrk There are several animal species that eat their young...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@truth_mmatters @MarcusAgricola @X2_T17 @realDonaldTrump Ah cool, sorry. I am getting crap flung all around.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@truth_mmatters @MarcusAgricola @X2_T17 @realDonaldTrump Not a bot just well educated and I know how to research.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonathanMcface @junzhang923 @AdrianaPalmier1 @MartinRich91 @Jbarkerjune @RonWaxman @cnnbrk And by marriage I meant same sex marriage, which was the tie in to Kavanaugh and that ruling. But I appreciate you listening and clarifying the conversation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@truth_mmatters @MarcusAgricola @X2_T17 @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/xOx64Ot1Yt true<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusanMo40897147 @tj_bedders @X2_T17 @GoJackFlynn @realDonaldTrump Oooh no I'm not stupid you just have terrible writing skills. I have no problem with it because a republican led enquiry found no wrong doing by the Bidens on that matter. Much like Benghazi. Go home Karen you're drunk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonathanMcface @junzhang923 @AdrianaPalmier1 @MartinRich91 @Jbarkerjune @RonWaxman @cnnbrk Seems like so stayed on topic to me. Forgive me for assuming you are a bogus account when you have repeated Trump rhetoric tweeted but a Biden hashtag in your bio.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonathanMcface @junzhang923 @AdrianaPalmier1 @MartinRich91 @Jbarkerjune @RonWaxman @cnnbrk Okay. My abortion and marriage comment was in reference to Amy Barrett. You then made the inference that fear over her was as unfounded as Kavanaugh. I then pointed out that he voted against the LGBT protections before the court earlier this year. So yes the comparison was valid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonathanMcface @junzhang923 @AdrianaPalmier1 @MartinRich91 @Jbarkerjune @RonWaxman @cnnbrk Because that was the first comment you said to me. And I responded. In reference to a SCOTUS ruling from this year. Then you just repeated yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonathanMcface @junzhang923 @AdrianaPalmier1 @MartinRich91 @Jbarkerjune @RonWaxman @cnnbrk My response to you was in reference to Kavanaughs dissent in the anti discrimination ruling earlier this year.   You want to learn to read and try again?  https://t.co/dOjegnoixp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusanMo40897147 @tj_bedders @X2_T17 @GoJackFlynn @realDonaldTrump And pretty sure his name is Dump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusanMo40897147 @tj_bedders @X2_T17 @GoJackFlynn @realDonaldTrump What question????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusanMo40897147 @tj_bedders @X2_T17 @GoJackFlynn @realDonaldTrump I have more problem with Trump letting Russia take hits out on our soldiers but ya know...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonathanMcface @junzhang923 @AdrianaPalmier1 @MartinRich91 @Jbarkerjune @RonWaxman @cnnbrk Point me to the rational wisdom you apparently speak? Wait wait wait, how is it you Dumpers know someone is a genius "Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV."  There you go. Now you know I'm a genius!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusanMo40897147 @tj_bedders @X2_T17 @GoJackFlynn @realDonaldTrump Tell me, why was it okay to block Obama's SCOTUS nominee because it was an election year but Dump is allowed to?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusanMo40897147 @tj_bedders @X2_T17 @GoJackFlynn @realDonaldTrump ...you never asked a question though? You ranted some conspiracy theory but like all Dumpers it's okay for him but not others. Like chain migration. Melanias family is okay but no one else. Hypocritical halfwits the lot of you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhh the Dump supporters are in fine form tonight. #BidenHarrisLandslide2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Camirenee1797 @Jbarkerjune @RonWaxman @cnnbrk Already have a master's degree I think I'm doing just fine. Wanting control over my own body does not make me stupid or ignorant it makes me....human?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonathanMcface @junzhang923 @AdrianaPalmier1 @MartinRich91 @Jbarkerjune @RonWaxman @cnnbrk You've said nothing rational.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coop_gaim13 Really? Try again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cupyours2 Move along robot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusanMo40897147 @tj_bedders @X2_T17 @GoJackFlynn @realDonaldTrump Trump became rich because of his handout from his father. No self made money about him. But that's only a problem when it's democrats right? Like immigration? Trump was going on about how great China is too. Do me a favour, look at where your red hat was made.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeffro069 @Samiam99 @tj_bedders @X2_T17 @GoJackFlynn @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Trump crapped his depends on the Apprentice sound stage. But go off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernMars  https://t.co/BKvV7eTgim<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@junzhang923 Dont want anything. Just think you should learn to listen before you swear at someone and dismiss them as stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@junzhang923 @JonathanMcface @AdrianaPalmier1 @MartinRich91 @Jbarkerjune @RonWaxman @cnnbrk No that comment was directed to the comment above. It is an obvious fake profile.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@junzhang923 No. The opposite. I was engaging in a conversation with you and you repeatedly swore at myself and others and it's both about me being "right" but illustrating the point I was making with evidence which you could not handle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonathanMcface @junzhang923 @AdrianaPalmier1 @MartinRich91 @Jbarkerjune @RonWaxman @cnnbrk Just saw your fake profile. Move along troll bot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernMars Did you read the entire thread?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@junzhang923 If you think it is necessary to swear at someone then you can leave. I made my point. You were wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeffro069 @Samiam99 @tj_bedders @X2_T17 @GoJackFlynn @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden "Mother" is Pence's creepy sister wife remember? Same one who won't let him be alone in a room with another woman because oooh scary temptation. #BidenHarrisLandslide2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@X2_T17 @realDonaldTrump Did he ask him why he doesn't have health care?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tj_bedders @X2_T17 @GoJackFlynn @realDonaldTrump Biden literally gives out his number. He does calls like this all the time. I don't support Trump but if he did this and made that man happy, that's great, but you can't deny Biden doing the same thing for years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@junzhang923 So was it necessary to swear at me repeatedly then? Perhaps you should work on your manners when people are trying to have a conversation with you and you may have the incorrect information.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarluskaP This is fake audio people. A terrible insult from some #MAGAt. #BidenHarrisLandslide2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@junzhang923 @AdrianaPalmier1 @MartinRich91 @Jbarkerjune @RonWaxman @cnnbrk @businessinsider The same job for less pay is EXACTLY what the data I just sent you explaining. It is not a case of saying "tell me a specific job" because it is habitual. You're being willfully ignorant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdrianaPalmier1 @junzhang923 @MartinRich91 @Jbarkerjune @RonWaxman @cnnbrk Yeah I think I am out too lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@junzhang923 @AdrianaPalmier1 @MartinRich91 @Jbarkerjune @RonWaxman @cnnbrk The wage gap is well documented.  https://t.co/bwNYGUzkPk via @businessinsider<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernMars Least I am not believing a faked audio and saying a funeral of someone who dedicated her life in service to the country you claim to love is a satanic ritual.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@junzhang923 @AdrianaPalmier1 @MartinRich91 @Jbarkerjune @RonWaxman @cnnbrk Okay if you would stop simply saying "fucking stupid" over again and actually try to understand the full picture. No, she won't pass a law saying women can't work. But likely vote against wage equality measures. Or diversity hiring policies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@junzhang923 @AdrianaPalmier1 @MartinRich91 @Jbarkerjune @RonWaxman @cnnbrk Women being in the home as opposed to career focused for example.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonathanMcface @junzhang923 @AdrianaPalmier1 @MartinRich91 @Jbarkerjune @RonWaxman @cnnbrk The same Kavanaugh that voted against antidiscrimination measures? Yup. That's the one. #BidenHarrisLandslide2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@junzhang923 @AdrianaPalmier1 @MartinRich91 @Jbarkerjune @RonWaxman @cnnbrk She is demonstrably anti abortion and has said on record she values "traditional gender roles". So yes. She will.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@junzhang923 @AdrianaPalmier1 @MartinRich91 @Jbarkerjune @RonWaxman @cnnbrk Like they literally can and will. Abortion and marriage equality will be revoked with her appointment and if Dump gets another term.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Richard26908235 @Anabelordo @cnnbrk Devils advocate - I think she used the term democracy in sense of the technical definition of a government with elected officials. Not the differential system with or without a royal figure head.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jbarkerjune @RonWaxman @cnnbrk Will you be so happy when you have to have a male relative sign off on any of your medical decisions?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My new favorite thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TNLiLi @reba @Spotify I think it is probably just a contract technicality, not a diss to MP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Followtheblonde I just listened to the first 2 episodes and my heart is so full and today I am committing to forging my own path. Episode 2 was such a reminder that you are the biggest creator of your fate, and 2020 hasn't won it all yet. #DoTheThing<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@alley76cat1 But you would be laughing it she was saying it was a BLM mask in the same scenario. Fucking hypocritical Trump culters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AirMail_Tweets @TamaraTaylor @EddieMcClintock The video footage of him being executed by a racist power hungry cop. Yes we do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AirMail_Tweets @TamaraTaylor @EddieMcClintock I don't know what racist handbook you pulled all that from but I suggest you take off your white hood and do some real research.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CastleAddict I sent her a bunch of links from my other account and basically said "I have to think you are literally doing this to mess with people now because that is easier than admitting you were wrong."  It is...insane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pixi_peters @fifail I got to ep 6 as well. Couldn't do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattbc I'm guessing "If you have someone in your care whose disability may prevent them from understanding fire safety or can not physically control their proximity then DO YOUR JOB AND TAKE CARE OF THEM FUCK WIT." didn't make it through legal?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissActress04 It is very telling that you would block me rather than say "oh my bad I was wrong" when several people politely tried to explain something to you. Good luck with that attitude.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am so happy for all the people who got to talk to @KatBarrell this weekend. She is the sweetest person I have had the pleasure to work with and she loves her fans so much. I can't wait to con with her and my #earpers again soon. #EarpCurseCon #WynonnaEarp<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CastleAddict Right?! That is such a good point lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CastleAddict ...too much?  https://t.co/ckm0SZLcr6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissActress04 @7JustinChambers You're also just realizing the president was impeached so I am really not surprised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevTra57 @grandfla12703 This is similar figures  to what happened to us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonSmithRS @BillFrederick8 @RepAdams Johnson not Jackson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dmbryant3 @BillFrederick8 @RonSmithRS @RepAdams No Nixon resigned before the articles were voted on. Clinton, Johnson and Trump are the only 3 recorded impeached presidents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you say something, and every single person you say it to says you are incorrect, chances are you need to fact check yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@koshaid1 @CastleAddict I'm still in a kind of numb daze over her...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CastleAddict True that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CastleAddict You'd think. Like take the hint when several people are saying the same thing that maybe you need to check your facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CastleAddict I literally sent her the harvard law review. She is doubling down out of embarrassment now I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissActress04 @Van_D1969 And I am not trying to be rude. It is a common misconception that impeach means to be removed. It doesn't.  It means it goes to senate hearings. He is one of 3 presidents to be impeached.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissActress04 @Van_D1969 Tara you are being wilfully ignorant or a troll now. Learn the democratic process before arguing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissActress04 @CajunBlueAZ1 No. You are misunderstanding the process. Clinton was impeached too. To be impeached means the house found enough cause to go to senate for hearings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissActress04 @CajunBlueAZ1  https://t.co/oCIs4ElRfz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissActress04 @CajunBlueAZ1 Yes he was. He was impeached. He was not found guilty but he WAS impeached.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AirMail_Tweets @TamaraTaylor @EddieMcClintock Never said I disliked him. I said I thought better of him. You can read my direct response to him and see I was very respectful.

<|startoftext|>True that! And tension. I'm working on a project right now that her work is helping me exponentially with.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PressStartLock @PiPArtemis @utterlyjace @AITA_reddit I worked retail and retail management for 10+ years and regulars were the BEST to kick out. They become entitled brats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edgar_a_bitch I had this same thing in Home Goods yesterday. Twas a sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenBlaze78 Back at ya! We are hanging in there. Here is hoping we will be reunited at a con! If we are allowed out ever again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenBlaze78 That is still to this day one of my fave TV scenes ever. How are you????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenBlaze78 I literally started singing Reflecting Light without noticing when I looked at this and saw L&amp;L<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fifail Sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fifail I would like you to teach me how to do that please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today I am icing a foster dog's nether regions after a neuter surgery...how does your Tuesday look? #dogslife #dogmom #fosterdog #AdoptDontShop<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DesmondsMark That's exactly what a robot would say...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DesmondsMark Sure you are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DesmondsMark Ah, okay, you're a fake account.  Cool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UnkleKnacker @fake_biden @GottaChangeIt I salut you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DesmondsMark Well not trying to be edgy so...cool?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DesmondsMark Me? Nope  real as Trumps tears come November!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Immortal_Graves @riverandmal Seems an awful lot of effort to admit you skipped health class...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@konaflower I stayed an east coast wimp haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katherinefugate @konaflower Also, the snow on Toronto is rough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katherinefugate @konaflower Comparable but you can live in Vancouver without a car which helps reduce expenses.  I miss that city every day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Currahee53 @rspyke @H_Combs He has a history of misdemeanors, and not complying with police. He was CARRYING a weapon and you say he would not have been seen as a threat, but an unarmed black man IS perceived as a threat, against multiple officers? That is the double standard right there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Currahee53 @rspyke @H_Combs I say this with no snark, I am genuinely asking, how do explain Kyle Rittenhouse NOT getting shot when police walked by him with a semi automatic weapon across his chest? How come he was afforded due process? Was he not a threat in the moment?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@evanthediplomat @DrJenGunter I just realized I missed a sentence in there and I sounded really blunt, apologies for that. I am just stunned over it. The O visa, with her modeling, I could see...but the EB-1 makes no sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LauraJeanTruman I have pointed out every mushroom in the same way. He and I should frolic in the fungus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justdawesome @DrJenGunter The O visa is much easier to obtain. "Oscar or Pulitzer" are the example qualifications given for an EB-1.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@evanthediplomat @DrJenGunter No. There is the O visa. But according to reports her permanent status was granted under the EB-1 which literally states "Oscar or Pulitzer" as an example of the qualification.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FANEXPODallas Stargate SG1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AITA_reddit NTA. You can double dip your own sauce and your SO. You gonna bump uglies but freak out over some nug crumbs? Nah.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, not going to lie when I saw She's 15 was trending I thought @realdonaldtrump had debuted wife number 4.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SSass34 @lesbiyinzer Oh that deserves bare feet on lego for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Persona85852976 @cenkuygur @katherinefugate @realDonaldTrump As I said my residency status is literally at stake, and therefore my marriage. So I am meant to wait until I have lost EVERYTHING rather than fight for an administration that will support me?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Persona85852976 @cenkuygur @katherinefugate @realDonaldTrump It does not matter WHERE it came from. It was always going to come here. He did not act to protect us like a leader should. And he literally tried to ban an LGBT group from the military...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ssamayoagt @cenkuygur @katherinefugate @realDonaldTrump Banning trans from the military. Reduced benefits to permanent status residence. Mass NIH funding cuts and freezes. Would be some of the bigger ones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Persona85852976 @cenkuygur @katherinefugate @realDonaldTrump Potentially losing my status because of the immigration reforms. His mishandling of the pandemic cost me my job. And yes we are fearful of the reactions if we show any affection in public because people are more open with their hatred.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Prepin_aint_ez @ManuelR38312662 @cenkuygur @katherinefugate @realDonaldTrump No, in all seriousness. Because his immigration reforms have put my status in jeopardy, my wife's student loans went up as a result of the tax reform and her wage did not. And I lost my job because of the mismanagement of the pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DTS2020KAG @ManuelR38312662 @cenkuygur @katherinefugate @realDonaldTrump Well, you clearly didn't even read that before you posted it...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillyBaldwin Why...why is he decomposing? Is this some Dorian Grey stuff?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyJo42441201 No, just someone who can spot a pile of BS a mile away. Hence I can see through Trump supporters. If your account IS real it is a troll account and well...good luck with having the time of day to do that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyJo42441201 You're a fake account, moving on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@10Ten24677782 @realDonaldTrump No, just well-spoken. And laughable the 5-month-old account with no name, no pic, and 8 followers is calling me a bot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edgar_a_bitch I have just had a similar... moment  Seriously people. Google.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuizanS @cenkuygur @katherinefugate @realDonaldTrump @POTUS You're right. And I do not hide who I am. But after a man takes a swing at you because you will not kiss your wife for him to watch. You are always on guard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BadassMomWriter @KetchupSnowman *Freud has entered the chat.*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuizanS @cenkuygur @katherinefugate @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I am glad for your cousin. That is how it should be. And it is not where I live. It always in the back of our minds when we are in public.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@allywalker1 It just keeps going.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuizanS @cenkuygur @katherinefugate @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Don't want coddling. I want to not be assaulted for holding my wife's hand. Not be deported because after doing it "the right way" my immigration is stalled because of mismanagement. Work in the career I love but can't because of a failed response to a health crisis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guys guys guys...I just made a discovery. If you are POLITE to T*ump peeps and ask "well could explain..." and make them question themselves...THEY EXPLODE. Try it. #BidenHarris #BidenHarris2020Landslide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuizanS @cenkuygur @katherinefugate @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I don't think you know what omniscient means. And you're proving the alt-right narrative here. I have not been anything but polite in my dialogue with you and you tell me to "shut up". You're so threatened it is laughable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuizanS @cenkuygur @katherinefugate @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Instead on conversing with me why are you being rude? I am not insulting you as a person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuizanS @cenkuygur @katherinefugate @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Congress passed the legislation after a months-long negotiation over several higher education bills. Trump signed the law in December. He signed it. It was not HIS doing. He needed to save face.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OklahomaTuba @cenkuygur @katherinefugate @realDonaldTrump Ha! Pro gay? With a pro conversion therapy running mate? Sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QRIUslikeu @cenkuygur @katherinefugate @realDonaldTrump It is not all a out me at all. That's the point. I am ONE person and am this malaligned. Literally millions of people like me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuizanS @cenkuygur @katherinefugate @realDonaldTrump @POTUS The vice president supports conversion therapy. Where is my gay friendly legislation? Trans people were banned from the military.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuizanS @cenkuygur @katherinefugate @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I have a masters degree in communications I can research quite well. Your response tells me you can't list ONE legislative move he has made to help the LGBT, immigrant, or arts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DTS2020KAG @ManuelR38312662 @cenkuygur @katherinefugate @realDonaldTrump Yet several of you Fux News folks just used the phrase "echo chamber" to me...oh the irony.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuizanS @cenkuygur @katherinefugate @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Please tell direct me to these then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did they say echo chamber on Fux News last night? I am getting it parroted to me from Donny John folks this morning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DTS2020KAG @ManuelR38312662 @cenkuygur @katherinefugate @realDonaldTrump Gay friendly? He said on camera "don't ask Pence about the gay community he would hang them all" and he banned trans people from the military. This administration is the most anti LGBT. I am married BECAUSE of Obama.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BangTownJimmy @DTS2020KAG @ManuelR38312662 @cenkuygur @katherinefugate @realDonaldTrump Thank you. I am sure all of his middle America voters are enjoying the private helicopter subsidies in the tax package.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigRich_77 @cenkuygur @katherinefugate @realDonaldTrump If voting ISN'T a representation of the constituents then...what is it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ManuelR38312662 @cenkuygur @katherinefugate @realDonaldTrump Very well informed actually. I am not in a position to not listen to all information. He has done nothing for anyone not a white 1%-er.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tim_lambeth No. That's actually not how it went but sound off boo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cenkuygur @katherinefugate @realDonaldTrump I am a gay female immigrant creative arts worker and my wife is a scientist. This entire administration is against every part of my existence. So when people in my life say they are voting for him, it tells me they don't care about me. And don't get he is only helping the rich.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@albinokid @davidhogg111 True that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BadassMomWriter No. And taking away all the bullshit rhetoric and drama, I am a gay female immigrant creative arts worker and my wife is a neuro scientist. This administration stands for no part of me or my marriage. I genuinely fear for what 4 more years would mean.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SNeurotypicals Thank you. The only 2 things to add are my left and right hands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edgar_a_bitch Oh a wipe. I have tried q tips but will have to try that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edgar_a_bitch Okay. Rockstar. Yas. And please how do you get those extended wings to be so clean. I look like a raccoon in front of a wind turbine when I do them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CloneNic I was RAGING over this so I did a little digging. He purchased the top homepage banner for the DNC duration. So there is no way to turn it off. I blocked the channel AND turned off all Google ad settings I could.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @YouTube if I BLOCK a user it means I don't want to see their damn content.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emtothea Anyone else sick of having to prove their cred for their passion? Sorry little boy if you come at me about Stargate SG1 I will end you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TamaraTaylor @michaelaconlin @galaxyconlive 100 bucks for 2 minutes for the one on ones? I'm sorry I know the money is for a good cause but that is straight up robbery. Other digital cons are doing 5 or 10 minutes for $50.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarySThompson I'd say so. I want no more loss from this disease, but tragedy is an adept teacher. If it was covid, perhaps some change will come<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What does it say about me that I saw Joyce Carol Oates' foot and thought "...that's it?"<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jvn I am a gay female immigrant who works in the creative arts. It hurts to see an administration that stands for NO part of me being so championed. But I am called a raging libtard snowflake...um no I would just like to feel seen by my government. #BidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay Chloe, you checked twitter, dumpster fire is still-a-burning. Get back to work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jvn Preach sister. This is what future students will look back on as subversive racism in the 21st century.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HartHanson I just started a Bones rewatch yesterday and we just to Amy Cullen. Possibly the most quietly heartbreaking episodes.  In my head her treatment caused the spontaneous remission and she went to Paris to celebrate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlishaRai Wait wait...your mum busted out HOMEMADE tandoori and someone complained? If that was me, the call from my mother would have been "I won't top that, she lives with you now..."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lesbiyinzer @emtothea Y'all just putting this out in the atmosphere like 2020 won't say "Hold my beer..."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SmaugDude @MovieMantz I was looking for you. I was straight up FURIOUS I gave this god awful thing my time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BornInY2K @MovieMantz Wow, I liked this movie but I thought I was the only one lol It has an actual following?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidBlue I blame Cats. We've been cursed since it was released. It pulled some Sumara/Ring bullshit on us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edgar_a_bitch There are times as well, you can see the distress of a meltdown on the person too, they WISH they could express another way and the weight of that adds to it. Unlike a tantrum where you can see stubbornness and fake indignation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lesbiyinzer Okay so we are making "Drunker. Queerer. Earpier." shirts for the weekend aren't we?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gatorjas HECK YES! I needed this today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbsentiaCastle The pilot after my friend posted a message saying "Ok,  someone please spoil Boom for me!". I asked her what she was talking about. She said, Castle. I asked her if it was good. She said yes. I went and bought the first season boxset the next day and then I was in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SaraRamirez I will be no good influence in this situation. If you're unsure about it, why not try and find an older/senior pup? A little less energy, still a great companion. These two jerks are my heart.  https://t.co/m5vCYJ0Idj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@uncannydazzler Glad to hear. Was very upset with what I saw "fans" doing in response to you. And I am not even a super fan of the show, I watch it because I work with the cast at cons. You do you, man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@876arsenal @Acyn I am trying to give that the benefit of the doubt but this was a prepared speech. I don't care he stumbled over pronouncing Yosemite,  but a prepared statement like this, I don't think he can slide on it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@emtothea @chocolateyshell These two boys are the heart balm we all need.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Michealfinane @TheClaudiaBlack This ad was the PEAK of marketing. Nothing has come close.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, I am now declaring that instead of using "balls" as a marker for strength, stamina, guts, we now all follow Betty White's lead and say "titanium vag" because balls are weak as shit. #Marvel fans feel free to use "vibranium vag". #Feminism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay but so far the best part of 2020 is the sex positive #WynonnaEarp fans standing up saying "well when I had sex on a staircase..." in defense of the show and I tell you I am living for it. @emtothea you are the gift that keeps on giving.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just got my first US medical bill...can someone talk to me about how this selling feet pics on #onlyfans work?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cleekers @KatBarrell I am so in for this ride. I had only watched the series once in real time so it was fun to remember it. I won't be so out of the loop at the conventions next year lol<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gata_chata @_FnJohnny @okaysoma @negit101 Agree. It was planned. Bride was totally cool with it. Also the weddings I have been to, bouquet toss was done as b&amp;g were leaving so meh. Do it as a surprise, no, if the bride and groom allow it, their choice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GhostOfKevin @EscoBlades I normally agree this is tacky as heck but it was obviously planned, and the bouquet toss has always been at the very end of any weddings I have been too so it's not...the worst?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@malevelynt_art @mikehgillespie @MxBadgerNorth I wish you all the good vibes that you may feel a little lighter too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@malevelynt_art @mikehgillespie @MxBadgerNorth I am diagnosed with OCD and anxiety but I do often wonder if I was missed with an autism diagnosis too. Physical contact is hard, eye contact is harder. But I do well with emotional reading so...Addressing the environmental factors helped reduce my OCD and anxiety symptoms but 🤷‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just a reminder you matter. Stay. #YouMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does my #2020Vision board in my #bulletjournal have my #WynonnaEarp crew on it? Yes it does. Because working with them this year at cons is gonna be AMAZING! #EarpNow #earpsoon #Earpers Also...these other goals will be CRUSHED!  https://t.co/QY2oi8XudF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay but do we think MAYBE January is such a cluster fuck because #2020 is just trying to get all its shit out of the way now? Like this is the new decades trial period so it trying it ALL out before it picks the subscription options for the next 10 years? #NewYear2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you need a reminder that humans are still good, this is our new #foster #fospice dog Blair. The rescue that we are working with set up an Amazon wish list for him and it all was purchased in 3 minutes. Thank you! #Dogs #rescuedogs #puppies  https://t.co/U6sf2BltiM<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, and good vibes to whatever you may celebrate!🎅🤶<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love that I am learning more about #Hanukkah and the Jewish faith in one holiday season on Twitter than I did in 12 years of compulsory "broad" religious education my parents paid a pretty penny for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joebonic_ @urfeministboss It comes from when a father could say "no" and that is why it, as a tradition, should be retired. The symbolism is antiquated and outdated. And yeah a relationship headed to marriage will be on the same page, but that person deserves the surprise first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joebonic_ @urfeministboss It is disrespectful to the daughter. The first person you ask if you can marry someone is THE PERSON YOU WANT TO MARRY. If a father says he needs to give you permission he needs a kick to the crotch, women ARE NOT property.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheCut I LOVE my cup but this article is super uninformed and not helpful FYI. People need to mind their own vajayjays.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@agy_lena @supbethany @TheCut That does depend on your personal menstrual symptoms too. I have menorrhagia so I fill a cup in an hour sometimes. But it is still more protection for me than anything else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joebonic_ @urfeministboss Yeah no, that is not how respecting a person works at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@urfeministboss @inquisitorlily Thank you. I argued my entire life that if my partner told someone before me they were going to ask me to marry them I would never forgive them. I also told my now wife I was not asking for blessing/permission because I was marrying her not her father. Disgusting and antiquated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@earpnado I feel so effing seen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomKingTK This was one of my faves of 2019. I plan to sit quietly and reread in its entirety soon.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I am actually so pumped. I am setting small manageable goals I am meeting with ease. Which will help the big goals come to fruition. I told my wife what I wanted to happen with my career and she supports it. I may...MAY actually do the thing. #2020ComingForYa<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thedruidess @StephenKing Why thank you! I will try to please!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_remina @AFemoid @dajefe77 @jvn I am guessing that was too me, if you read the entire thread I was not being xenophobic BUT I was mocking her xenophobia and repeated use of the word "American" as an obvious insult. However she and I talked at length and learned each others views so...good talk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abrokencolumn @angelicaross Nose hurts I snort laughed so hard...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sapphicidylle Okay kid, you need to put down the twitter and pick up a history book. While you're at it look up the definitions of xenophobic and hypocrisy. K?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenKing "2-mule wagon in a jet plane world" is going to be the first single off my debut country album, can we discuss royalties?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sapphicidylle So she is allowed to be xenophobic but others aren't?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sapphicidylle @AFemoid Literally had free college through to my masters degree and was not being xenophobic BUT I was mocking her xenophobia and repeated use of the word "American" as an obvious insult. However she and I talked at length and we cool so how about you just stay in your lane there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AFemoid @dajefe77 @jvn That is a very complicated stance to take. But at least I understand what you're saying a little more. I think it is disrespectful to not just call them women though. That is what they identify as. Or in the case of JVN non binary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AFemoid @dajefe77 @jvn Okay, I guess I understood the headline was referring to GI. Because that is the identity of the person.  Either way the headline is wrong if, as you said, men have been on the cover before. So, you would say that Jazz Jennings and Laverne Cox, for example, are men/male?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AFemoid @dajefe77 @jvn Okay, I am genuinely trying to understand what you are saying. No rudeness, no disrespect. Are you saying that if you are born with a penis, you are male and a man. Your sex is male and you gender is male and that is it. You can not be anything else?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AFemoid @radpesha @dajefe77 @jvn Very well aware of feminist theory. But whatever point the 2 of you are trying to make, is not coming across.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AFemoid @dajefe77 @jvn Because they were highlighting that he was the first to not identify as female on the cover. Because his "gender identity" is not male. Something you yourself said can change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AFemoid @dajefe77 @jvn Okay so to go back to your original tweet - he is NOT identifying out of biology. So what are you actually trying to argue?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@radpesha @AFemoid @dajefe77 @jvn ...I do not have enough time to explain to you how wrong that is. But I am sorry that you have been brainwashed to believe women come last. I pitt you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AFemoid @dajefe77 @jvn HOW can you say in one tweet gender change is possible in humans and then say that he can't identify out of his gender. You are literally saying opposite things to argue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@radpesha @AFemoid @dajefe77 @jvn That was not what she was saying. And JVN is not denying he has male chromosomes his "gender identity" is non-binary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AFemoid @dajefe77 @jvn I am VERY well aware of the difference. But gender identity is what people 'identify' as. So your argument makes NO sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AFemoid Aw yay thanks for the shout out you ignorant little child.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AFemoid @dajefe77 @jvn Identifying as non-binary is LITERALLY Gender change.  You're 3rd world education system is REALLY terrible down there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AFemoid @dajefe77 @jvn Literally none of those support your argument and only one if from a somewhat reputable source...but doesn't actually address the point you're trying to make. Oh and I'm Australian, I can have all the free hospital stays I want. Try again, Brazilian.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LauraJeanTruman YAS PLEASE. We love working our brunch muscles!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AFemoid @dajefe77 @jvn I'd really like to see the published study you authored and the scientific/medical research you conducted that conclusively proved this...stick to soccer, Brazilian.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LauraJeanTruman Legit, you look fire girl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So we can #arrestdanielshravan OR he could be politely gang raped and not killed by willing individuals.  By his reasoning he will be fine. Oh...wait...only women you say? Well practice what you preach mother fucker!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emtothea @crspy1987 @lesbiyinzer True that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emtothea @crspy1987 @lesbiyinzer Or if they are tweeting you an obvious joke, but they start the tweet off with "what if you had..." which totally sounds like pitching something to you,  maybe say NOT A PITCH at the beginning.

<|startoftext|>What do I do? I get my shit together and make MY blog/brand what I have always wanted it to be. Don't be outdone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you've had a brand name for over 4 years, blog, insta, facebook, twitter, even if you aren't famous - can you ask someone to change their name if they launched the same name as you 2 months ago?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffreeStar Need more coffee but aside from that...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamCarter4eva That is hilarious!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EscoBlades That meme....I'm done. Today is topped.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamCarter4eva It also makes them feel guilty when they throw it out. They appreciate the gesture but at the end of the day they toss most of it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rabiasquared @aimeeshull But you did just come out and say it is bull shit...so you could have clarified in the beginning or just not said anything but you wanted interactions so there you guy.  https://t.co/e2bkFT4yJY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DearUniverse Let's change things up, yeah? Let's bring some creative opportunity my way. Let's  carve the path I need. I am ready bro.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RhubarbMacabre @MaerinB I need to see both new do's!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MelanieScrofano Jeff is cancelled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanCasey @JERICHO I thought it was just me? I ask Alexa "How are you?" Regularly. On Sunday she said  "I'm doing well, I'm working on my Klingon."  Which is very on brand for my household so...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emtothea @DragonCon @KatBarrell are we crashing this one?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trying to pull off something fun for the @KatBarrell autograph table at @DragonCon ...need the good vibes and juju #Earpers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also...creative/productivity/mental block really needs to leave now...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So bummed I am not going to get to hang with @KatBarrell this weekend, but at least dragon con is soon! Can't wait to work with that dear heart again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MatthewJshow @shawgerald4 @realDonaldTrump Stuck...we are STUCK with them. But not for much longer! #ImpeachDonaldTrumpNOW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gatorjas @EHConCanada Do this pose or nothing!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brookehouts Girl, I tried to give you the benefit of the doubt... but no. You DID spit on your dog. That sound and action could be nothing else. And it does not take expensive training to take a dog that is excited like that and do some simple exercises with treats to engage their brain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_youhadonejob1 Okay but for real...which one did you notice first?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need a writing partner. I love collabowriting and I am better when I have an accountability partner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But seriously @Scientology where is #ShelleyMiscavige ? If she is fine why not release a video statement from her to prove us all wrong. Or did you drop her in a volcano?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New life goal is to work with Tom Cruise and introduce myself as Xenu. #Scientology #Cult<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm done. I'm done respecting the 2A as an outsider living here. I'm done justifying the reasonable situations for gun ownership. This country is killing itself everyday and the government's hands are the ones covered in blood. #Abolish2A #massshooting #ThisIsAmerica<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And I just realised that said 202....but I'm gonna take it. Sounds like something you'd call a sophomore con!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today: I got some great new creative tasks at work. I am wearing pants 2 sizes smaller than the last pair I bought. I had a breakthrough in a large mental road block I've been dealing with. @EarpExpo 202 was announced. would say Wednesday worked out pretty dang good. #GOODDAY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EarpSista I am trying to work this math too lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fifail  https://t.co/WpTZgdLyL5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EarpExpo In all seriousness, so glad you are coming back. One of, if not the best, conventions I have had the pleasure of working and it is wonderful to be with your team.  https://t.co/ffWcpjP8XQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EarpExpo Need all the rainbows.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EarpExpo *Books in calendar*. See you soon. #HandlerLife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kearagraves I felt like that my first day when the director was a woman and a p.o.c. It was awesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KateDrummond_ @DIBSRescue @PhotoLMP Yeah, it's a blurry line.  https://t.co/ueDfUPlyEP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @MiloVentimiglia I just saw the trailer for TAORITR and on a scale of 1 to Don't even think of wearing mascara- how prepared should I be to cry? #ThaArtOfRacingInTheRain #DogMovies #DontBreakMyHeart<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My new life goal is to teach as many people as possible that there is no such thing as left brain/right brain character or skill dominance.  Brains don't work like that. At all.  https://t.co/InQCoAvTQn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gatorjas I feel this in my very dna.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jessphoenix2018 @anamariecox That is so cool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yashar @harpersbazaarus That...that's an untouched booty? God damn I am a bridge troll.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HollyKentuckey Yeah that's a no sweetie. You're ugly from the inside out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@burnpiIe It sounds like you have some pretty good habits as it is. Instead of running try weights or body resistance.  Also make sure you're not under eating. You might have a free ticket to some more calories.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@akkitwts Being Doggo.  https://t.co/5Uw4VUPdgF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jessphoenix2018 @anamariecox You...you just casually use the phrase "next time Im on an active volcano..."<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gatorjas My office did...just saying.😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone is watching #StrangerThings3 or #SpiderManFarFromHome today. That's it. And that's the kind of #4thofJuly I can get behind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rmayemsinger Here is a derpy dog for you.  Happy 4th!  https://t.co/eK7tpAZ6YW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Re: #TheLittleMermaid Her race had nothing to do with the storyline. She kills herself and turns to sludge in the original story, so Disney weren't going for accuracy regardless. Stop comparing to recasting prominent black figures where their race is canon. She's a fuckin' fish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ConventionsEtc @DragonCon @emtothea @DominiqueP_C @KatBarrell @MichaelEklund @TAMARADUARTE Can't wait!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jadabird @inquisitorlily Until the person does the same behaviour the XXth time because everyone just "listens" and no one says "this is destructive" or "I'm sorry but you're wrong..."  You should always listen first but know when to speak up or if need be walk away for your own mental health.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tashaaaaaaa Matchbox 20...yeah I know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@divasamilee @Oprah taught me this in an episode when I was young. Never forgotten it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LauraJeanTruman I am pretty sure this actually does exist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Serious jealousy for those going to @EHConCanada  Didnt think working with the #WynonnaEarp cast would be so wonderful. Guess I will just have to wait till @DragonCon and @Earpapalooza 😞🙁😖  https://t.co/L7jLXxld6A<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love my team and job...but I wish I could work conventions full time. I am good at it, I enjoy it and supporting charities is amazing. Maybe one day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DamianWassel Not Without My Daughter.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SoileauRebecca @EarpExpo @BridgetOnTV @Earperdemic @EarpSista @lesbiyinzer @PunkyStarshine Ours have been in the "to fold" pile...you know the one...I am trying to think of something fun to do with one of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EarpExpo @SoileauRebecca @BridgetOnTV @Earperdemic @EarpSista @lesbiyinzer @PunkyStarshine Thank you for including us in one of, if not the best convention experience I have had to date!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like the show but wouldn't call myself a super fan. However, working #EarpExpo made me realise I need more #WynonnaEarp friends. They good people. #FightForWynonna<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When total strangers don't answer your questions on Twitter  https://t.co/mZT0TEi86J<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Conventions are awesome but con crud is not. I am so dang sick still.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cleekers @VRC_Pitbull @KatBarrell @EarpExpo Okay am I missing something where are the Kat pictures coming from?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New life goal is to work/collaborate with @emtothea ...putting it out there universe. Do your thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WynonnaFans @EarpExpo I miss weaving through service corridors ...and getting too speak to everyone in the autograph lines!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HollidaysStache  https://t.co/jqyQPv1dXr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So over being sick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheAimsss @EarpExpo @KatBarrell I TOOK IT WHEN YOU WEREN'T LOOKING oh man I'm dying!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you Catato for your company at #EarpExpo and may the next part of your journey be grand.  #Earpers #FightForWynonna @EarpExpo @KatBarrell  https://t.co/6y2RhLSmeQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have a pretty fun idea for a podcast...am so damn excited! I know what I am doing this weekend!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EarpExpo @emtothea @BridgetOnTV 😂😂😂😂😂 naaaah Kat is too much fun. We will just crash workshops and hang out backstage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emtothea @BridgetOnTV @EarpExpo Bridget, I might fight you for her next con!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So crashing the @emtothea workshop with @KatBarrell was a highlight of #EarpExpo for me. We didn't see the whole thing sadly but one note I took in my phone was "execution is your currency" was worth it. I am going to DO the thing. #amwriting #dothething.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheAimsss @KatBarrell @EarpExpo Aw thank you! It was SO gun meeting you. #followthetape<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheAimsss No just no ew gross!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KathleenBroux Oh no no I didn't mean it like that! I gave it to Wolf :) they posted it for people to see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taylouderman @MelanieScrofano @KatBarrell @wynhvught I, as a responsible handler, should have told Kat to be respectful. I believe my exact words were "oh you have to draw a dick...right there..."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emtothea Girl, next time, get a horrified look on your  face and say in a soft voice "You...you can see me? And they will not bother you again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Back at the office and though I prefer working with @KatBarrell this coworker is pretty great. @EarpExpo #EarpExpo #Earpers #FightForWynonna #conlife  https://t.co/8Q0bY11kqW<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Thank you to the wonderful @EarpExpo team for an amazing weekend, to @emtothea for making this space and a HUGE thank you to the delightful @KatBarrell for allowing me to spend the weekend with her.

<|startoftext|>@MissFenderr Oh and support equal opportunity for LGBT couple adoption. Like if the mother really wants to carry to term give her the option of more loving families so it is an easier choice. Because at the moment it is not.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ftank13 @jameelajamil Some people, yes some careless people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@burnpiIe Hey. You are fabulous.  Just letting you know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HaleynAbbey @burnpiIe @jameelajamil Realise what? The spelling. I am Australian that is the Australian/British English spelling. You uneducated half wit. I will wait for you to google it an apologize (or apologise as we say).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HaleynAbbey @burnpiIe @jameelajamil Exactly how are the 2 related?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@burnpiIe @HaleynAbbey @jameelajamil A 12 year old girl impregnated by her father is not committing murder. A woman raped walking home in a short skirt is not committing murder.  A woman who makes a mistake is not committing murder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HaleynAbbey @burnpiIe @jameelajamil I know right! It's mind blowing when you realise. You're welcome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HaleynAbbey @burnpiIe @jameelajamil Good thing abortion isn't murder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ftank13 @jameelajamil It NEVER is an easy choice.  Women are not using it as birth control. And just because they can look back and say it was right doesn't mean they don't care or that it was easy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ftank13 @jameelajamil And? So? Therefore? What? That was them. If they actually exist. If they regret it, that is truly sad. But it does not matter. The choice should be there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>90 years in prison or 90 years with a child they don't want. Either way you a sentencing women to life because we are the ones who can get pregnant and you refuse to not be in control. #AlabamaAbortionBan #WomensRightsAreHumanRights #AbortionRights #ProChoice #ProChoiceBecause<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MomTruth @jameelajamil No adoption is not always a better option. The psychological toll of an unwanted pregnancy is tremendous.  Adoption is not a magic fucking spell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jameelajamil Seeing a lot of fucking men weigh in on this. It's REAL easy to judge when you have absolutely no weight of the burden.  Get a vasectomy until you are married if life is so fucking sacred.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HaleynAbbey @jameelajamil Is not easy or a fix all option.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@discjunky316 @jameelajamil Only a man would think this analogy was clever or accurate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BryceDelRio @jameelajamil Do you have any idea of the psychological toll it takes carrying a child to term. Adoption is NOT easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jameelajamil I support you girl. People who think "I'll just give it away once it's born..." is an easy option are delusional! The psychological toll of carrying an unwanted pregnancy to term is immense. And it's how babies end up in dumpsters or bathrooms at a mall.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmdm13 @jameelajamil Good thing it was her decision then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adelina_k_j @jameelajamil It's a historical text not a bloody spell book. A womb does NOT shut down in the case of rape, no matter if you believe in a God or not. You are allowed to go to a church that believes one thing, a woman is allowed to go to a medical clinic because she believes another.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouzaKing00 @nowthisisliving Possibly. It just reads like support and diminishes what he did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mia___Mar @nowthisisliving And neither does Tati or other creators that have come out since and said JC is toxic. You obviously support him though if you came after my tweet and called Tati a dumbass when you won't even listen to her version of events.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mia___Mar @nowthisisliving And I was a supporter of JC. I am not just blindly accepting what Tati said. I have gone through everything I can.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mia___Mar @nowthisisliving Well if your response is "dumb ass Tati" then I don't really think anything will change your mind. But take the time to watch her video. Watch the video of the waiter. Look at his past comments regarding straight men.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowthisisliving Okay let's not just blow by the fact that JC is a predatory piece of garbage. The straight men are not upset because a gay man hit on them, they are upset because he sexually harrassed them. Don't defend his behaviour.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Southuhnboi @Talmar70 @RealDeanCain @green_art @deborah_knight @fraser_anning I thank you for the props. I had a look at myself a while back and realized I learn more listening than I do talking. I won't entertain personal attacks or hatred but I will always try and converse facts and opinions, more so those different than mine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaPergs @Talmar70 @RealDeanCain @green_art @deborah_knight @fraser_anning Was that meant to be "pro-life" in that? And I agree completely. So many things need to change.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Talmar70 @RealDeanCain @green_art @deborah_knight @fraser_anning I didn't feel like you were hijacking. I did just want to keep things respectful. Same way with Dean. He and I will never agree but I can always try to meet in the middle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Talmar70 @RealDeanCain @green_art @deborah_knight @fraser_anning It is compatible on the grounds that a "typical" far right argument is that all life is sacred.  I asked and Dean answered - total respect. Keeping this a civil discussion. So I pass on my same respect to you. We learn and we grow when we take the time to listen. I am listening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealDeanCain @green_art @deborah_knight @fraser_anning Thank you for the honest response Dean.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@fifail Gah! That is horrifying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fifail Eeeek that is rough! If it bacteria did they give you an idea of where you picked it up?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fifail Shit girl do you think it is a virus or an allergy? Get some benadryl to take the edge off and see a doctor!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LivesMatter831 @samswey Yeah "both sides"....where have I heard that before?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samswey Me: Trying to discover the limit of Trump supporter hate...  https://t.co/BZoZcY3bwE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*looks around* okay Friday we got some work to do!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fifail @Writtenndust It took years but they finally cracked me and I will say to-may-to now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fifail @Writtenndust You summed my life up in a tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fifail @xfkirsten Not worth driving?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fifail YAAAAASSS!!! Go girl.  Have you started the new job yet??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I live and love in this country and the US is my new forever home, but for now, I can't #Vote  So I beg ALL of you who can, who have the privilege of a voice, to vote so those of us who can't for whatever reason, have a voice too. #Midterms2018 #YourVoiceYourVote #YourVoteCounts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizLim For my latest? Juror number 4. She knows what's up...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not to brag but total #humblebrag  I have made Wednesday my bitch! Who else smashed a to-do list today!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mostly because it helping her not irritate a small injury she has  but also for the cuteness likes. #dogs #dogsinblankets #fall  https://t.co/mGcxTmvha9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@runwithskizzers Good luck! Currently on a similar journey. See you on the other side!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay Wednesday, you wanna get some shit done? Let's go. #smashit #amwriting #makingmyownpath<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LilLeen I WASNT READY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LauraJeanTruman I have been pretending to work all morning...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the #strugglebus today. Anyone else having a #meh day?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a final round job interview tomorrow which means having an income again which means I can finally order my first ever @JeffreeStar order now I am in the US. #popmycherryjeffree #unicornbloodiscoming<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ItsJustMe122 Yes. But she made a careless mistake. I'm a production assistant so as someone who is TV crew, I can't not support them making a living. I don't care who Rosanne supports politically. Her actions had nothing to do with that. She was careless with her platform.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LunaMajix *American<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LunaMajix Okay I am not America  so the political aspect of it doesn't really affect me. And I work in Television (like I have real credits I didn't just delivery something to  news room once) so objectively as a episode of TV I liked it a lot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Suffragentleman *shrug* I'm Australian so not really an insult but okay mate call me a liberal and claim to be neutral in your bio. Have a nice day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LunaMajix It was awesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And last tweet about the #TheConners - whatever your political stance is- remember this cast and crew did not deserve to lose their jobs because of one selfish woman. They deserve the chance to make their art and make their living.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheConners was a very good episode of TV. Sorry if you can't separate your red hat from your head long enough to enjoy it for what it was. Well written, funny, and culturally relevant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay I gave it a chance and objectively #TheConners gave me the reboot I wanted when they said Roseanne was coming back. The first 5 minutes captured all the things I loved about the original without the garbage that was in the reboot. Proof that it takes a village, not one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GlamLifeGuru  I wish you were in #Atlanta  so you could do my makeup for my job interview tomorrow. Guess I will have to settle for rewatching your Glowing Natural video #sendhelp 😆😆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My wife just yelled out "dick jerk face!" at my dog, and how was your Monday?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fifail @torak Right?? Though I am looking forward to earning US money to pay my aussie credit card. And I am more concerned about the honeymoon/southern weight I have gained lol I barely fit my clothes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fifail lol yeah I am here for good.  I am slightly freaked though. I need income. I want to buy fancy make up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fifail And...I can't really go home lol that whole marriage thing. But this is home. I need to send another round of applications out this weekend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fifail Terrible. I am waiting to hear back from one that I really want but I am doubting my ability to be a productive member of society lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fifail Good luck! Is it a writing gig??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Phone interview done. I want this job a lot now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The next day...still misty eyed over #AStarIsBorn and @ladygaga - see it. You need the theatre experience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whinymateriaI "I think I am going to go for a run..."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every #TaylorSwift @taylorswift13  fan - DO NOT be ashamed to become politically aware because Taylor has broken her silence. If it has made you take notice, GOOD! Read, learn, and if you can, register and vote. Our country's #Reputation is at stake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay who let @RealJamesWoods back on twitter? I guess he needs something to do seeing as he will never work again...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckWendig I have been trying to blocked by JW for MONTHS! A little jelly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I saw #AStarIsBorn and I am feeling lots of feelings and there were real tears. @ladygaga and #bradleycooper are beyond captivating. Incredible music and a worthy 4th incarnation  of the story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jodipicoult Thank you for an incredible evening!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>* her #ATL tour stop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tonight on her #ATL @jodipicoult said "...laws are black and white, #women are 1000 shades of grey." And honestly I have never felt a clarity like what this observation gave me. We are bound my laws that, in their very design, ignore us.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JackalopeFancy Oh my goodness what a cute little button. Hope you are both doing well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EscoBlades ...I felt the blood vessels pop I laughed so hard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BadassMomWriter I have made a lot of choices in my life, marrying a woman was the best one. I was treated well by my male partners, but the respect and safety I feel with her is something I never had with anyone else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you tweet your fave author with 2 typos....really now????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*see.  Am so excited I can't type.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jodipicoult after missing you on a handful of appearances I am finally getting to se you in Atlanta next week! I am so beyond excited. See you #ATL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have so far achieved nothing. I am sick of "planning" but no clue where to start.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brain is super motivated but can not focus on more than one task for more than 10 minutes. Can someone suggest some tips to harness this energy into #productivity ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@giapanda82 @JeffreeStar @tacobell I need those delights like now!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xokassandrac Corin Nemic. A stargate guy. Disgusting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When  an actor you like and respect victim shames on Twitter...how about unfollow. And if I see his smarmy little pinhead at a convention in the future I will ask him to his face why he thinks you should side with an alleged rapist...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GeorgeTakei That's it. People of color need to start randomly saying to white people "are you here legally?"

<|startoftext|>@sunnybrittney Brittney, I just wanted to pass on my congratulations like so many others have. You just put an incredible thumbprint on the Wicked Franchise and Broadway not to mention opened doors for others. I think we can all agree it is a change "for good".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealroseanne I will never agree with you politically but I respected you artistically. However as a production assistant/ crew member I can't respect you risking the employment of you crew members so carelessly. Learn from this. Sometimes your opinion can remain a thought in your head.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheClaudiaBlack @bit_raptor And this is why we respect and admire you so much Claudia. Your compassion and kindness is so genuine. Thank you for being the example you are.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The more I see and read the more I am angry for the crew of #Roseanne These people would have structured months around season 2, turned down other jobs. They don't have royalties or a macadamia farm to fall back on.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gayle_lynne @flashman Whatever, it is always amusing to see fans who think they know anything about the show because they talked to someone at a con.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gayle_lynne @flashman There is a BIG difference between what you get told by cast and crew and what actually happens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnnalisaAccardi Connected, yes. I wouldn't say it if I didn't mean it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gayle_lynne @flashman Well...bullying is a strong word. But not untrue and neither were innocent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katiesteckly Every day. Every damn day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomiLahren you're garbage...just letting you know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok I am almost excited for The Rookie...almost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotZachThomas @ACLU I was raised and am a practicing Catholic so progressive may not be the most accurate. But I look beyond my personal opinions, not judge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotZachThomas @ACLU It's not absurd it's the same hypocrisy as condemning same sex marriage but not divorce.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotZachThomas @ACLU If you think all life is sacred you don't get to support capital  punishment and not abortion it is contradictory to what you are preaching<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotZachThomas @ACLU Your sheltered religious centered upbringing is making this choice. Not an informed well rounded opinion. (5)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotZachThomas you are a 21 year old kid who needs some real world exposure under their belt. I am not going to play the "man" card but (4)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotZachThomas @ACLU You don't have to like it or support it but you don't get condemn those who disagree. (3)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotZachThomas @ACLU Also dangerous. You can't simply condemn or deny a choice because you personally don't think it is right. (2)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotZachThomas @ACLU My overall argument, is that it is not a black and white issue so to issue black and white or blanket rules is not only inadequate but (1)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotZachThomas @ACLU Lastly where is your equal rage against capital punishment?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotZachThomas @ACLU Thanks for proving me right bro. Good times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotZachThomas @ACLU Also, what about 13 year old rape victims or overjoyed mothers who are told the baby they want will likely kill them due to compkications?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotZachThomas @ACLU Well the elderly person would PROBABLY tell you you save the child and make their own choice but you just PROVED my point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JanetMorana Not exactly. I ask you If you had to save a 3 year old toddler or a canister of 100 viable, 4 week embryos from a fire what would you do?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotZachThomas @ACLU Not exactly. I ask you - If you had to save a 3 year old toddler or a canister of 100 viable, 4 week embryos from a fire what would you do?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kindhearted2015 But in answer to YOUR question - it's the same thing. And the fact you would block me &amp; not answer tells me I got you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Kindhearted2015 If you had to save 1, 3 year old toddler or a canister of 100 viable, 4 week embryos from a fire what would you do?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you aren't openly condeming capital punishment just as much you don't to play the pro-life card. #JusticeforJane<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernKeeks 13 yr old girl raped by her father? 28 yr old told baby she wants will kill her due to complications? Your blanket statement is wrong.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@idinamenzel Queen of Swords is my new anthem. Thank you. I really needed a song like that right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenBlaze78 I hate you. Well no but I low key jealous hate you a little right now :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes it's really hard to trust it's all going to work out.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The #deplorable people voting for #Trump are the same people who said they are moving to Canada when same sex marriage came in. #debate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Raisin6000000 Are you Kidding? Please tell me you're kidding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SaraRamirez @HillaryClinton in my mind I am voting for her from Australia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How the moderator has not rolled up his notes and smacked Trump over the nose saying "no! Bad candidate no!" #debate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is "yeah well Florida hates you!" In anyway a proper response? #debate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@btwprod Yes. And the sad thing is it just kind of rolled off as another thing on the list.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever did he get my route 44 coke?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DING DING DING EMAILS #debate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally. Finally Hillary is just saying it like it is and not taking his BS anymore. #debate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He just blamed the sexual assault victims on her campaign? #debate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"WHEN I'm President." HELL YES HILLARY YOU MANIFEST THAT SHIT #debate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is like Chump forgets there was a President between Clinton and Obama. #debate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meanwhile let me make a shallow observation that Hillary looks fabulous and Chump looks like he hasn't showered since last #debate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The SWEETEST thing would be some underground Russian movement to release a picture of Chump and Putin together. #debate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chump is basically resorting to high-school debate team tactics of double speak. #debate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chumps defense of Russia/Putin is legitimately terrifying. #debate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PuppetTrump coming from the Jim Henson creature shop next fall! #Debate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever oh he needs a lot of things. I am waiting for him to just saying "but EMAILS" over and over again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love how Hillary's gloves are finally off and yet she is still factual, composed and not missing a beat. #debate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can we take a moment to realise he just used the phrase "drug lord" in a presidential #debate what a fool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only racist fools want the wall you chump #trump #debate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only chump #trump could go from abortion to racism that fast. #debate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@xfkirsten very true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xfkirsten excellent! I'm sure there are more outlanders just too scared to come forward.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Officially too many Back to the Future references floating around. #unpopularopinion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xfkirsten I'm so done. This once brilliant show is LITERALLY getting by on ass jokes and Beckett is a jerk. Just out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever Nothing. Nothing at all. #Supergirl is our new Monday date night right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And with that scraping along the bottom of the comedic barrel I am done with #Castle  - so long boys. Should have stopped at lucky number 7.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are two types of quiet; peaceful and lonely.  Sometimes it's hard to distinguish other times it's painfully easy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>"...sometimes I lay down, no more can I do. But then I go on again, because you ask me to."  One step at a time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@metheridge I've been doing that too lately. And not in the day long date with Netflix kind of way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What I've learned about 'me' in the last 24hrs  1. I binge podcasts like TV 2. I'm better at change than I was 3. Curiosity makes me insane<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Sunday is slowly becoming both a calming end and charged beginning to my week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xfkirsten Oh most definitely and that song makes you wanna charge on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xfkirsten Well now I am at my bus stop singing Hairspray.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever Just so...so much #SSS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever Right?!?! I read that one and thought of Sunday and got chills.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My horoscope in today's edition  of the paper I work for. I just feel like this is telling me to do something big.  http://t.co/XE8L0zSajy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lily_bart well thanks for telling me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am so used to having my schedule dictated to me I am still not 100% sure I wasn't meant to be at work today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently the sun was just to get me up and out because now I am heading home the clouds have rolled in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever Completely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a beautiful sunny day. Feels like it's going to be a good one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever OK I'll start groveling now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever I may have. You know me too well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever right?? I was a little happy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just got told that not only do I have a 3 day weekend I also get to cut out at 2pm tomorrow.  I love having a grown up job!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever I believe that. However things happen though  this one feels good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think I stumbled on to something wonderful this morning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever @MLK333 because you have a life and use your time to be a useful grown up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever Completely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever you know your person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Books often open your mind,  but occasionally you read that special one that opens your soul. Accepting the last page is hard with this one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever Oh most definitely.  Because reasons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Castle 8x2 Bad writing, horrible convenient plot devices, destroyed the impact of Joanna Beckett story and shattered Beckett as character.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> http://t.co/BmRd5wkR04<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Cake" with Jennifer Anniston is amazing but here is no way to prepare yourself emotionally for it, so just give in to the tears.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I read @feliciaday 'S book today. And now I want to take on tomorrow like a badass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever Because reasons. Because.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever completely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"On the edge of something wonderful." Nothing quite like truly believing there are beautiful things on the horizon.  #NewDawn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I figure as long as I stay strong and never eat a KFC Double Down I will always in some small way be ahead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever it is. Just a little dead ended this afternoon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever In a way. I am just excited and want to jump into some new stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MLK333 @cnangel4ever @teefury me thinks the witches need to coordinate hehe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever Which one MUST you have. And I may have to get Stitch as toothless.  What have you done to me bank account!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever @taraloki @OldManWinter14 @AlexiHawley and by thank you card you mean trunk of spiders?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time line is N.American people because no one else is celebrating that Aussies/Kiwis/Brits have been saying #Castle right this whole time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OK if I am abducted please tell my captors that I love spiders so I don't have to go through that  #Castle<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Today is my fifth anniversary living in Vancouver. Really hard to wrap my head around that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisEsther WHAT? But that is the greatest!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Found this gem on Facebook this morning.  http://t.co/bAins37ULl<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Got lunch, yay. Now to hope I keep this lock up all day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have been watching a generator for 6 hours and no spell off or radio. Think I am the forgotten PA today. #SetLife #Hungry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nearly went to set without a lucky @LipstkAdvntr ribbon in my hair. And that would have been certain doom.  http://t.co/0hAWcUOsc4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow the 5am crowd is thick today. No seats on train and a line up for this bus. But at least it is not a $40 cab ride. #PALife #EarlyHurts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cecimartin oh that would be awesome thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cecimartin oh I cry every single time I watch that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cecimartin oo! Her and Rob Thomas singing Stop Draggin My Heart Around is one of my fave covers.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cecimartin this is adorable! Can I ask where you met her?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got a seat on the bus and the train this morning. Pretty sure that is as close to  lottery win as I'll ever get.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not remembering what but WHO really matters. Don't forget who is in your corner.  http://t.co/CBBUNKrZy6<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My iPod is so full of guilty pleasure songs I would have to assume a new identity if anyone was to browse through it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's soundtrack is def Florence and the Machine. #EarWorms<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aobajohsai :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is the day you look like extra human garbage the day you encounter solid 10s at every turn?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaileyDAuthor @NaNoWordSprints More like "America" and "Everywhere Else"  :p<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xfkirsten I plan to. Going to cancel gym and use it in the mornings instead. Goal is a photoshoot with a friend here :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xfkirsten guess who's new apartment has a brand new track outside the front door? Now to actually use it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever @Stana_Katic I just want to be full of filmy goodness :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever 6 days work and all that is in my head is that story @Stana_Katic told about being in a play when it was against the rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reading through social media and very much going into #GetOffMyLawn mode.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, moral dilemma, how bad would it be to fake a tragic stair falling incident and tell work my back is screwed up to PA all next week?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bootbarn Original concept for Easy Rider. #CaptionTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatherineIsOdd @DavidBlue yup I agree. So much more than a kids movie.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> http://t.co/UrmymMutgw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sapphs HAHAHA yup. Some random guy has figured out my bus schedule and walks out every afternoon and asks for my number.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought having a stalker would be endearing...yeah no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*sings* Well, I got a brand new pair of roller skates, you got a brand new key. I think that we should get together and try them on you see.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That awesome sense of self worth when the job you applied for weeks ago is still advertised and you didn't even get an interview.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stana_Katic How goes #ElephantWinter plans? Congrats on current projects too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My entire timeline is the #NerdHQ stream not working. *walks out*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@monicapotter Have kept this one close this week.  http://t.co/5zBQLypK32<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sapphs very much so!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Struggles for 2 days to put podcasts onto iPod, finds "sync podcasts" button, remembers why I don't have a MAC. #TheyMockYou<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is oddly comforting when your mum tells you "oh bugger your family we are always here, you're doing what's important" #LivingAbroad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing like a sisterly check in chat. Oceans separate us but nothing can come between us. #MissYou  http://t.co/iLIZXsvjW3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sapphs I did. Same area sort of. Bigger place. Good interim while I get through the next year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moving. Planning moving. Planning future. Sacrificing for the greater good. Amazing how everything can flip in a day.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lauriel42 @immazinaman  I have called her Idina the times I spoke to her and she was fine. More important to stay calm and not fangirl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh 6am transit crowd how I have missed you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cecimartin That is true hehe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Much as I hate to sound like Oprah. thank goodness for a-ha moments. They hit you like a train. But shit they are good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sapphs hehe I want it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay is there anyone going to #SDCC that would be willing to get me the Evil Queen/OUAT funko pop?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing quite like the fear of history repeating itself. Nothing quite like the determination to change the outcome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@32memories I was listening to Alison Krauss and you popped into my head. Hope you're well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/qv4i2h9eZC this one too. Seems like a #Smash kind of day.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever hehe I haven't looked. Haven't even signed up yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever I held off drinking the kool aid. And 5$ says I can guess which one it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The time may be coming for me to cave in and join Pinterest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When the venti Starbucks just isn't enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sapphs @xfkirsten Trying to anyway. You are doing pretty damn great yourself girl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sapphs @xfkirsten lol no no no that was a dig at myself - not you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sapphs @xfkirsten You can run a mile? ;P<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@xfkirsten @Sapphs That is GOLD.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xfkirsten @Sapphs I too would drink, then run. Because that wouldn't end badly at ALL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sapphs ooooo nice. You could do one city for Christmas and one for NYE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sapphs hehe glad you are not mating across the globe lol and fun times! Short list?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xfkirsten @Sapphs How right you are!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am surrounded by the best people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sapphs BUT I came here with a plan and this is my city and I am not giving it up easily. Not now. How are you going?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sapphs They have reopened it so that goes full steam this month. I am having to focus on not being homeless right now...thanks S.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sapphs just prioritised the next year or so. Gave up some fun for security. Next 12 months are big ones.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aobajohsai oh no! What's going on?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is now the second half of the year. I think the first half taught me something and laid a new foundation. Time to start building on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am used to things in my life coming in waves. It's always been the pattern. This just happens to be one of the bigger ones. #SurfsUp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever seems like an awesome double celebration day to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This.  https://t.co/gBXrKrVi4F<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Working on #CanadaDay but the three day weekend and overtime I get as a trade off is worth it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you've powered through the days to do list and there is 20 mins left of the work clock you can hide in your office and eat candy right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lauriel42 hey hey doing well! How are you?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever that's debatable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Truth  http://t.co/vymsJILA3u<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are decisions you can't take back, mistakes you can't undo. Sometimes the rubble is just too much to sort through.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sapphs maybe. If I get my residency I am planning a visit home. If not I will be moving back next July.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sapphs awe ye ol stomping grounds. I need to pay a visit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sapphs miss your face too! Film is going well. Getting the residency going. How goes you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sapphs Always!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sapphs Yeah. It is sad. She has not planned well so now has decided to sell and we are scrambling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sapphs yup. Have lost all respect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever I. Am. Fuming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Um excuse me landlady? You tell me you are selling the place a YEAR earlier than planned and you dare ask me to give you 2 months notice?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JenBlaze78 you too my sweet! You and @cnangel4ever are going to have a fabulous time and one of you must yell "NORMAN MAILER I'M PREGNANT"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3 days on set and I am totally wiped out. Proof I am not at full strength at the moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‘Cause I've burned all of my bridges  And learned every last lesson too,  So how can I start new?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just had an iced caramel macchiato for the first time...WHY DIDN'T ANYONE TELL ME ABOUT THEM SOONER!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The president of our company is coming in late this afternoon and I am on the early shift. I think there was some planning there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you, 6am work start, for turning me into an old woman in bed by 10.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyQuinn93 Give it to a relative and tell them it is a very expensive, exotic brand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just wish someone would tell me what the hell I did...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone else eating their feelings? Just me...oh ok.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aobajohsai ooooohhhhhh no<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bad Blood  was over produced, over directed over hyped BS. Like a 13 year old's piece of fan fiction in music video form.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think Toni Collete said it best in Muriel's Wedding "I'm NOT nothing..."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thinking it is just...time for bed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have gone grocery shopping angry upset and hungry...I can only imagine what my cart will look like at the end of this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope, last few weeks and final gut punch from this afternoon still swirling around. #NotEnoughCocktails<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tonight we drink. If I can't remember the last six weeks by the end of the evening then I will consider it a success.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aobajohsai some ass bought them. Just play the computer. The volume is pretty decent.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Well, I haven't been fired yet so I guess today could have gone worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LipstkAdvntr there is a fine line between the creative life and the undead I guess...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can only push someone away so far before they can't find their way back to you. No matter how much they try, or want to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even though you know it will pass, doesn't mean it isn't slowly taking away every ounce of strength you have.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CleverDever Love it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok NOW that bit has aired...someone make a gif please? #CastleFinale<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angela_sherrill RIGHT? Crafted SO well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angela_sherrill Yup, had a very, very rough day at work and just going to be happy it was an awesome ep. No pulling apart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I loved the #CastleFinale but am not emotionally stable enough to process it fully. Maybe a rewatch next week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yup, perfect. #CastleFinale<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever yeah they were different events. I think. It was a confusing dream.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever @seamusdever @Stana_Katic the video was cool. You ditching me to hang with stana was not :p<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had dream was watching a video of @seamusdever and @Stana_Katic singing together. Need this in real life now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know how much I have left in me today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever @DohertyShannen @H_Combs Ok I'm in. Any tips #ShannenAndHolly?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheAndrewAlcorn I just had a week and feel more stressed than before I left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever can you grab snacks and I will get the booze.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not feeling this day. Anyone wanna run away to a tropical paradise with me?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I leave at 5am tomorrow, am still at work, haven't packed or picked my shoes...crap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Major shift around in my day job to start the new year. The joy of retail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Potluck lunch at work, so much food for my face.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't believe it has been nearly a year since this wonderful weekend. Miss your faces ladies.  http://t.co/gkm2vRuUdm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thejamessnyder Will have to try this. And if you haven't tried- honey and vegemite together on crumpets is a perfect marriage in food form.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Streesed that planning 2015 actually means having to plan 2016. I just wish I could settle. Maybe my top resolution should be 'grow up'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have my first 3 resolutions worked out. Thinking an even 10 will be my goal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2014 is like an amazing but long movie...you want to keep watching but you also want it to end so you can go to the bathroom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lovely breather after the contemplative spiral from earlier today when I forced myself to admit the next year of my life is a game changer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spent the evening skyping/messaging with beautiful souls. Digital age may be destroying us but I love the connections I have made with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angela_sherrill @cnangel4ever we may have to just sit and sob together when it ends.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daisycakes4 @cnangel4ever I told you. I am always right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever Yes dear... ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xfkirsten perhaps a change of focus is what I need. I am facing some big decisions/changes in the new year and am already stressed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How does one let go of a life goal without totally falling apart?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@see_ejc beyond true! Amazing the way some people flow into our lives in a way we never expected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Merry Christmas @katebosworth @michael_polish Have a wonderful day and thank you for another year of your creative inspiration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just had the goal of making it from this morning to boxing day without crying. No such luck. #LivingAbroad #FamilyReallyIsHome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just walked around my work showing @TylerKnott  's book to anyone who would listen to me. #Enamoured<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You all need to check out @TylerKnott and his new book  #ChasersOfTheLight  My heart hasn't stuttered over a book like this in a long time.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Don't look back all you'll ever get is the dust from the steps before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisEsther Nick that is just rude!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look a career in production is cool but let's be real I am staying in Canada for @PurdysChocolate mainly Sweet Georgia Browns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shadowslocum wow that is some rain!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever @UntoIdSecrets I would have to say yes...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something empowering about finding the perfect red lipstick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Carry cash people, technology is not perfect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever it is more a case of no computers working at work so I can't do anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever hehe not bailing now. Friday is legit because today was cancelled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very close to bailing on work and going home to curl up in a ball and read.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meanwhile bless child actors that ensure a wrap time and let me be showered and in bed by 10:45<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Castle_Examiner Hahaha we are awesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Castle_Examiner #NoHassleCastle Hehehe see what I did there?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HartHanson David's face makes me question where your hands are :p<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MiloVentimiglia You are totally right MV. Am still new so each set day is a gift and wonderful learning experience. And craft services ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever @chadgcreasey @daracreasey Team Hanning?? Nikki lets not be rash.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now excuse me, we are about to lock our actor in the trunk of a car...for a scene I swear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Won't see #Castle until tomorrow - but I am filming a show for the same network. Counts right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever @castle_abc love you too miss thang!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robkyker I am on a closed set but would tweet pic back if I could.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks to @MiloVentimiglia for taking the time to say hi. PA days aren't glam but people like him make it a joy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rather boisterous scene being filmed. AD "You ok?" Actor "That was AWESOME!" #SetLife #WalkieChatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@allcharisma @alexandraa_fxs Didn't we all. One of the few things that truly broke my love of the Buffy/Angel universe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xfkirsten No sadly we didn't make it but we are planning it for the end of this year :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"@StephanieJBlock: Walken's Hook should not have played the tambourine but the cowbell." This just made me snort my cider.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And tomorrow I up going to curl up and rewatch #BigSur because my day off needs some @katebosworth and @michael_polish magic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was just hit with the creative stick and am now vibrating with need to see this project I am working on come to life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@castlepromos Not always. Sometimes they have to be destroyed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever Sadly the awesome is based on uncertainty and it is making me uneasy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Slightly overwhelmed by 2015 already and we aren't even out of the gate yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today is my Friday. This makes me happy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This round. I know there are only so many songs but the important ones should stay sacred.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally realized why Castle using In My Veins bothers me so much. It was in Greys Anatomy S6 finale at pivotal moment. Sorry Castle you lose<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jenblaze78 @cnangel4ever I think it was lifting stuff at work :S I am just a walking mess haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jenblaze78 @cnangel4ever Yes thanks, cept I really did a number on back this week but all is well. How are you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reba @kixbrooks @ronniedunn Is it too early to request "Indian Summer" , yes, ok...how about now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@followtheblonde @caesarspalace @kixbrooks @reba @ronniedunn So we can request "Peterman Box Seats" :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenBlaze78 RIGHT!? Like when he said "you are my boyhood fantasy" that was so a S2 Rick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenBlaze78 I do!! They feel like Season 1-3 caskett again to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stana_Katic Imagine a world where one acted like an adult but loved like a child...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just got stopped by someone to tell me how great my hair looked. Vancouver peeps go to @HairByJayma and you can have this too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairByJayma Girly can you send me the address of the salon for Tuesday?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the words of Meredith Grey I am having a case of the dark and twisties today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have the best people. @cnangel4ever being one in particular.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First snow, day off tomorrow and a new book to read. This is good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another day done and dusted on @TheWhispersABC Happy Thanksgiving to cast and crew. Enjoy your weekend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/spQyJ3Qcot This is what I am working on atm. Yes, I was filming this in a real morgue. Not this trailer, a few eps in now.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever If only hehe. Maybe after work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Feeling a little unraveled today. Lets talk about something fun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@77rocket @taraloki Oh now who can resist the campy fun group dance numbers they bust out. And Marie is a really interesting person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sticks919 @aviquijada And neither of you invited me...well fine then :p<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shadowslocum Nice!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cleverdever Yup mouth is just a little too much like Twisty from American Horror Story #Nightmares<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jillianmichaels possibility that next photo IS parent running in to grab kid and this person just snapped this at the right time? #Optimism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RuthKatic Unless it fails and you end up drunken married to them...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@see_ejc currently a combination of 4 and 10.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Taught myself to knit off my arms last night. I felt proud. Tonight I am going to attempt to use this skill to make an infinity scarf.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thelaurengraham @JenESmith I take this book with me everywhere. Whenever I need a minute to gather myself I read a page or 2.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So filming in the old hospital was fun...until I was put in the morgue. Yes, you all need to watch @TheWhispersABC to thank me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lisaschomas Recovering from a hectic day of filming yesterday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarrySloane and #LilyRabe killing it on #TheWhispers today. This show is going to give you delicious chills. #PALife @TheWhispersABC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>197 followers *subtract the bots and spam* 9...I have 9 followers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah if I get a call time that'd be great.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MiloVentimiglia embarrassed to say I looked it up on YouTube but think I got it ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tomorrow will be another day on #The Whispers and I am still too terrified to try and pronounce @MiloVentimiglia 's last name out loud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My dream job; a director making screen magic with her favourite creatives. #SoTheresThat @hellogiggles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I insist we all have a 2 minute dance party right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobKyker Whelp my work here is done. meanwhile you are a good luck charm. have got each gig since you wished me luck. #GoodCrewJuJu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robkyker Admit it, you have sung the thunder song with him.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Busting out the pocket/hand warmers today.  http://t.co/jq66bGbf2O<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another fun day on #TheWhispers, another wonderful cast and crew to drive me to make this crazy dream become reality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, upon further consideration it is clear that gay cowboy from last nights #Castle needs a spinoff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stana_katic this would be how I am treated after a few drinks. #TheChattyGeekIsAChattyDrunk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever Me too - gotta grow mine!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever hahahaha indeed -  I have the hat! That one only has certain sizes available. Looking for one that comes in all sizes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever Yup -  much more you. And that was the wrong link. Oops.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> http://t.co/VNXuqj0wKO For those joining me next Halloween/Cosplay Chance #BlackLeatherBeckett #CaskettAtLast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Totally a way for #Castle to get his iPhone 6 #CaskettAtLast #AdmitIt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TerriEdda Already shopping for the cosplay pieces.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I WILL cosplay Black leather cowgirl Beckett. I already found the corset on ebay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TerriEdda Another way he has ruined us for all for those you know "real life" men.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah #Castle team we need the gay cowboy as a series regular. I didn't realise this show was missing anything until now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AviQuijada He was magical.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And because I need the universe to know - I watched my early Canadian feed PVR not a download. It's not much but all support counts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just snort laughed in a very dignified and lady like manner through that entire episode of #Castle - well done all cast and crew.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Such a delight and privilege to see @MiloVentimiglia and #LilyRabe do their thing today. This show is going to be amazing. #TheWhispers #PA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>6AM call time tomorrow. The things we do. #PALife #MovieMagic #BigAssToDoListTonight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My new stock made me think of @Stana_Katic Hehehe  http://t.co/ov0qaxoubO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a light A certain kind of light That never shone on me. I want my life to be Lived with you<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@katebosworth It was! Met some amazing people I can't wait to work with again. And next time I will definitely say hi :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope #LifeOnTheLine film wrapped well @katebosworth - have to admit was too shy to say hi when I was there. That and being professional ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seamusdever And just WHAT exactly did you type into Google image search to pull that up?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Maybe all there really is, is just the next thing. The next thing that happens. Maybe you're not supposed to remember anybody's promises."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever Well I am very fortunate to have the people in my corner that I do ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever have to keep up the promise I made at #CastleCon to work my ass off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And in continuing with our theme of today will be a good day - just got booked on set for Monday. #SetLife #ProductionRat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThisIsRobThomas Pretty sure we all have the clap just looking at that pic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It took 15 years but that last barrier is crossed. A customer just kissed me. I am...beyond ready to leave my day job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What are you doing to make Friday awesome? Me - a treat breakfast of pancakes to help tackle the to do list. #TodayWillBeAwesome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xfkirsten Touche - but if I try running in the snow it will be YouTube worthy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sunday mornings will now start off with @JillianMichaels #YogaMeltdown because I will use the cold as a reason not to go running #NoExcuses<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right now the inside of my head must resemble one of those hoarder houses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aobajohsai are...you...serious?????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever gotta admit I don't know what we are sassing each other over now lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever You had 2 hours on me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anyone else suffer late night manic productivity? I should be chilling with a book but Noooooooo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @RobKyker just wanted to say thanks for your part in the great ep this week!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Castle and cats. Time to grab the proverbial fork.#I'mDone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenBlaze78 and from a filming point of view - less people the better with a scene like that. actors included.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenBlaze78 I thought for a minute it was strange, but then realised that immediate family is a clear boundary, no picking and choosing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I love creative breakthroughs. Now perhaps I should focus on it rather than tweeting about it, right @LipstkAdvntr ?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MaerinB @OrigianalFunko MINE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As I told @TerriEdda and @AndrewWMarlowe at #CastleCon they are the standard I hold myself to and aspire to. Tonight again they proved why.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedCarpetLuke I agree no spoliers -  but DAMN! #Perfect #IWouldGetMarriedInIt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TerriEdda I was -  I couldn't take my eyes off the screen for the hour. But the first thing I had to do after was tweet you thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't even attempt to keep up with my timeline right now. Too much #Castle love. Hope everyone who has seen it so far enjoyed it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was perfect #Castle @TerriEdda I shall be grinning for days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Back in the couve' and not ready for the cold. Great mini getaway in LA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another con done and dusted, wasn't the best weekend but worth it for the chance to talk to Terri and Andrew.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After talking to @AndrewWMarlowe and @TerriEdda today I WILL fight for my career harder than ever and be the next wave they inspire. #Thanks<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AJ_SalemBooks Usually every second time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>honestly surprised Stana isn't on GMA on Friday to hide from the fans descending on LA. Yes I count myself as one :p<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cruella is coming to Storybrooke??? I must make calls and get back on this show. #OUAT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xfkirsten hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahaaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NathanFillion Did you ever have to take a terrifying chance for you career? #PassionVsPayingtheBills<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Though I am looking forward to #CastleCon this weekend I really want to sleep so hard. No day off in 3 weeks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Castletasmic Yup that about sums it up lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WilliamRodgers Any excuse for red velour sweatpants right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That moment when you read a tweet you agree with...but the way it is written makes you furious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xfkirsten Not just me then?! I am hiding in my office right now. Really want to just bail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well the cranky pants are well and truly on today. Just going to go --------» over there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FromOurDarkSide Thanks. A little sad by this but understandable. Maybe next time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Castletasmic that is flipping mash potato level awesome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amandatapping @FromOurDarkSide Can women on working visas enter or do you need to be a permanent resident?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedCarpetLuke Wow I thought only Oprah had that power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stana_katic has taken over the character I am writing. Future Sine Timore project maybe? #DreamBigOrDontBother<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hoping the creative outlet that is @NaNoWriMo will snap me out of this funk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AviQuijada @cecimartin I know. I am very lucky I have had wonderful crews so far. Never once felt unsure/unsafe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"@cecimartin: 👉 “@AviQuijada: Jeez. I can’t even #SarahJones  http://t.co/nM31UeBQ0d”" No words. This is hard to watch but important.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have to wonder if flying so high is worth the constant crash landings. I am never prepared enough for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xfkirsten I just did the same thing. I may or may not have cried in the shower too. #OverIt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LanaParrilla Can I play too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LipstkAdvntr A gentlemen's agreement!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LipstkAdvntr I will if you will. *extends hand for shake*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy Birthday @michael_polish and  @His_Squadron_Of You are true artistic gifts to this crazy place and inspire me every single day.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aobajohsai SHOW ME PICTURES<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angela_sherrill Hope all is well. Here any time you want to talk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thought I had all this worked out. Really universe I could use some help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some good company to counteract the kind of crushing day I had.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever Buffy on netflix here. *left handed high five*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobKyker Coolest/weirdest prop you have had on a set that sticks out in your mind?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katebosworth the aftermath of that shot. But the mud was totally worth it. It looked incredible.  http://t.co/VMXuc2EQfJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stana_Katic Said Directors to production assistants everywhere ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katebosworth @juliebenz 16 hour PA days may not be glam but being on set with you two sure reminded me why I am doing it. #Inspired<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Castletasmic @ALTravelProject not sure what part she is in but It is so easy to #ATP up here. #GoCanada<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Delighted to be working on #LifeOnTheLine  tomorrow. @katebosworth #JohnTravolta  @DevonESawa @realgilbellows what could be better?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't want to be a super star, rich and famous, I just want to create.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Need to keep my momentum going. Productivity is exhausting but so satisfying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xfkirsten And they are YOUNG people too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xfkirsten Glad it is not just me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(2) Like location shoots all the time. every event they attend. Don't they work? Have school? Where do you get your money?!??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(1) Ok I admit I fangirl hard. But I don't get these people that seem to just...be...wherever any single Castle cast member is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LipstkAdvntr Happy Birthday eve!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks twitter I DID actually want to keep following those people!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rockin the #OUAT 2nd unit today. #SetLife #PA #Dream<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel so gross. I should not be in public right now. #LateNight #SetLife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After seeing her in action yesterday I need to write a script for @LanaParrilla. She is is unbelievable. And I need to PA on #OUAT again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshdallas I will never look at a racoon the same way ever again. #ThanksForTheMemories<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>subtle selfies are hard but #EvilRegals I added my feather to my necklace to represent you all today. #OUAT #SetLife  http://t.co/yBmSMKNyMh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am going to Lorelai Gilmore the coffee cart on set so hard when I get there. #CraftyIsLife<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CastlePromos @Marielyfan @TinkonBrink well just another thing to show me I am a talentless hack lol #Amazeballs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now watching #OUAT for research. It counts as productive...right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And in a fun twist of events...I am working on Once Upon A Time tomorrow. #SetLife #OUAT #PAfun<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think I need to set up a twitter account just for PCAs or just vote online. Don't want to spam tweeps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CastleAddict This is the best. Ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RegaliaApp @Sandraxf @RoksandaIlincic @Stana_Katic @OfficialMelB Have to go with Stana for colour choice and shoe choice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...it's a weary that's so deep and strong it soaks through everything. Even your clothes feel tired.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, I don't mind missing out on a gig but a text back saying "thanks but its filled" so I am not stuck to my phone would be nice...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blog article idea - On Location Etiquette: How legally you don't have to listen to 90% of what they say but it pays to not be a dick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Castle_ABC @ForeverABC With all respect if I cared for #Forever I would follow it. Please respect #Castle a little more. #StickToCastle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@idinamenzel I obviously have been sleeping wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@immazinaman HOLY TOLEDO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyQuinn93 Molly WHAT is your skincare secret? I'm half ginger got the skin not the hair &amp; look like a failed lab test compared to you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love seeing my #Stargate alumni in #Castle. For the record Cliff Simon is lovely even if he did beat the snot out of Castle and Beckett.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you are reading your Kindle on a crowded train and the word nipple appears on the page 4 times. #CantHideThat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chris_Brow Hope our on set paths cross one day. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lipstkadvntr Soon. We will get there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taraloki I love what it stands for - just shows that entertainment budgets are wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This show is a wonderful cause but my god the bad writing and awkwardness is getting to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone not in the US have a direct link for the EMA stream?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CastleCon flights booked! Now...to tell work I won't be there for 4 days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cecimartin @ERAlban The struggle is real.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever @TheCaskett I want ALLLLLL the scruff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheCaskett Scruff is the new smooth...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sam_jaeger @sarahwatson42 Ninja dramadey? #IdWatchThat #IdEvenWriteThat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PenelopeAuthor Read SBD in one sitting last night. Your approach to the subject was rather amazing. Will read it again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This day is not off to a good start. #SleptIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just ugly cried through 75% of @nbcparenthood and regret nothing. This ensemble cast will go down as one of the best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stana_Katic *sings* "Well people talk, I don't care. Cos I ain't no fool and I ain't no square!" ...now I have to watch this movie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok people hit me with some book recommendations. I seem to be attracted to nothing on my Kindle so come at me with some titles/authors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have nothing to watch between Bones and Parenthood - Castle rewatch? Yeah there is no "too many times" for this episode.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever BEYOND SUCKS. Sucks looks as this and says "damn that sucks!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Days like today I need my crew. Just want to chill and laugh and they are all too far away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stana_katic Ever feel like your were chasing the impossible? How do you deal with the uncertainty in this industry? #CareerCrisis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trying to locate my friend today proved I have not explored/got to know my city enough. #VancouverLove #GottaGetOutMore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jon_huertas Nov 6, 7 or 8 would work for me. I need to hear Bartender live again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michael_polish @katebosworth The two of you remind me of this.  http://t.co/k82OCzj4Zg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I look at this morning and it moves me to say Oh my god what the hell did I do?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Feel like I am in wrong train and realised too many stations in.  Easier to just ride it to the end than try and find my way back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lauriel42 @idinamenzel Sure thing! Not sure what I wanna do - probably a bracelet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThisIsRobThomas I shouldn't have but I laughed...that shocked instant laugh followed by a solid "WTF"?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dorkatic I love this :) where is it from?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lauriel42 @idinamenzel I am trying to design something with "No More Wasted Time" :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RobKyker  Rob each weeks episode is a gift - we are nothing but grateful for the hard work from the whole crew.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MysteryCr8tve I said this, not so eloquently, just yesterday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The match-on-action when she grabs him in the precinct and pushes him on the bed. My PA heart squeed. #FilmNerd #Castle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not only was tonights #Castle well written for a "silly" episode, it was sexy as hell AND had lots of cool film-y things and techniques too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok #Castle we may not be done. If last week was the awkward coffee meet up tonight was the epic back together date. You owe Chad and Dara.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Cross your fingers people - amazing gig this week I may be on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WilliamRodgers I vote both.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erbear1877 And lol sorry I just realised you may not remember me, we have a bunch of mutual Castle peeps and talked on Tamalas video chat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had a vacation, now I need a staycation to catch up on life. This 3 day weekend is going to be hectic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erbear1877 You're in Vancouver too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mariyoush Well gold star because all correct and you shaved 10 years off my age :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So... @Stana_Katic has been hiding the fountain of youth this whole time. #ShareWithTheRestOfTheClass<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stana_Katic Your smoulder game is so strong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crying just a little. Went to buy a ticket for Nov @ThrillingAdv and it is sold out. #AllMyFriendsAreGoing #BabyJustGotPutInACorner<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angela_sherrill @nbcparenthood The ring!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sandraxf No one seems to care that it means poop! Drives me nuts!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Re: last tweet I am not just pouting for nothing they are filming outside my house and the production called me to work on it too late.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sitting on my sofa pouting into sushi because I am not out filming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh man I missed #Arrow and it was the episode I worked on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JillianMichaels Help Jillian!! Best moves to slim calves? Sexy boot season will be here soon!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllCharisma Maybe ask Siegfried and Roy how good an idea it is. All fun and games until you can see your own spleen. #ButITotallyWantOneToo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If/Then fans - does anyone else feel the physical hit when Liz sings the line "And my love, our life is over..." Or am I overly attached?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can see my floor again. Most of the items were just moved into smaller organised piles to take on through the week. #TakingTheWin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I also just stumbled across the show #FakingIt and I am disgustingly hooked 3 episodes in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is a rather unfortunate to do pile in the middle of my floor. I need helper elves STAT!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZoePerdue @JillianMichaels I swear my thighs groaned *jjiiillliiaaann* with every step the day after I did Shed and Shred the first time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I miss the twitter fun with @allywalker1 @GarySThompson and @chy_leigh on Wednesdays with a new @TaxiBrooklyn  @nbc you should renew it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CleverDever I call Glinda...oh who am I kidding I would be the wicked witch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No more wasted time. No more time for doubt. You say you're not sure you're a hero? It’s time you should find out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My post vacation brain is useless. I got so little done today, I think stuff I had done previously got retroactively undone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewBikichky All I hear is "Seven is my stage name. Produce my chow and be gone!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need to clean up, create stuff, write 2 articles and organise the next 6 weeks of my life. Oh and lock down a gig for next Tuesday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Goal is to PA on #OUAT before the end of the year. Ok universe - you got this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllGeek2MeRadio @thinkgeek Yes! I am writing this in my head now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cecimartin @angela_sherrill It made me laugh  - but I am very tired so it could be that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So that picture of Nathan today - the one from episode 4 - hands up anyone else with a case of exploding ovaries!?!?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FelicPlunkett  Reminded what it feels like to read your words for the first time. Eyes welled heart swelled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewWMarlowe @Stana_Katic You wont believe the things I would do to learn the answer to that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh THERE'S my show! That ending. #TheRealReasonHeBecameAWriter #NeedToKnow #Castle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angela_sherrill I want this on a tee shirt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Frikkin DVR didn't start recording Castle. Guess I am waiting another 2 hours like the folks down South of me. #OhCanada<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cause we’re always starting over every life we’re living. And we’re always just awake every step we take.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever @evilapprentice Oh I loved them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@evilapprentice @cnangel4ever I will always love Fred and what Cordelia became. Such great characters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katiwarren @Dxfan2013 :( i am sorry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever @Mandatory YES!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katiwarren @Dxfan2013 i would say tech glitch. your please unblock would not show up if still blocked...right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stana_Katic  http://t.co/JSCmG0XSEQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC_Publicity Holy crap you actually mentioned Castle. #Stunned<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@biermann I can never keep up. Plus I get the Canadian feed and people tend to frown on the early bird tweets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @MollyQuinn93 we would love to see you @ #CastleCon in Nov. All the cool kids are doing it. Ask @Jon_Huertas and @btwprod<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angela_sherrill Right!? I see many a twist and turn coming up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angela_sherrill I LOVE the mystery the premiere set up, just the execution of it bugged me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever You are allowed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought my spelling in LA of "Kloeh" was the best I could get.  http://t.co/BhILUvSkBi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh hey it is Monday. Tonight better be good #Castle You dont owe me anything but I would like my show back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2 weeks off 2 days on 2 days off. Not bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seamusdever Did you put it down near @Stana_Katic and look away for moment?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone go and get their motivation on with @MysteryCr8tve right now. Go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>May be one of my top souvenirs from LA #HotTopic #CityWalk #LiloAndStitch  http://t.co/jwui7HRg8u<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>pretty much just sitting around waiting  for a con close by that @wwwbigbaldhead is attending.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@idinamenzel 2 vs in B4 I realized I was singing What The Fxxx in the middle of work. Just had to own it and see it through at that point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ruthkatic @lanaparrilla or Lana?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey you there with that face in the mirror, what the hell are you looking at? Who are you there to judge me?You’re exactly like me but flat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theoduscrane All 5 ft 2 of me is giggling at you. Sorry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@becka1201 Becka please call the Arringtons. There is an emergency.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever oh no! did someone get chunky?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trying to come up with ways to keep the post vacation blues setting in too hard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chy_leigh @mrnwest 'Here I Go' from #If/Then 'In The Morning' by Norah Jones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Came home to a filthty house with a bad smell. Thanks roomies. Screw you too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angela_sherrill @cnangel4ever I caved in and am going to Castle Con. #Nowillpower<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever see you in a few weeks angel!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excuse me twitter account how DARE you just unfollow @allywalker1   because you glitches up. #Rude #DontMessWithAnAllyFan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stana_katic That is the kind of thing you wish for when no one is looking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saying goodbye to my parents as they go back to Australia after seeing them for the first time in 3 years. Talk about right in the feels.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every once in a while you should pop the bubble you live in. You never know what you will see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sitting up in the quiet zone watching the fun and happenings of the #WalkingDead premiere at Universal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harthanson Trying to decide on just how much comfort candy I need to get through tonight's episode. Any suggestions?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To stay and watch the #WalkingDead red carpet or not. If only we knew what time it kicked off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidblue Will you be at the walking dead premier at Universal tonight?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@castletasmic I feel there is a funny story here!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey people anyone have details on Walking Dead premier at Universal tonight? Google has failed. Times/tickets/Links thanks! RT :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How many Universal Studio tours does it take to spot @stana_katic on the back lot? #AnnualPassFTW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just got a selfie with #NormanReedus DAY MADE!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @stana_katic if you want to come crash #NormanReedusOnExtra outside Universal Studios we would be ok with that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Castle at Universal again tomorrow. #AnualPassFTW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Inadvertently having lunch in the middle of filming NCIS. Oops. L<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Managed to see #Castle at Universal Studios today. Not a lot visible but some fantastic background costumes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Castle season 7 opener was a sad let down. I respect this show too much to just like it because it is the premier.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sick as a dog in LA and poor @cnangel4ever is dragging my near lifeless body around. Gotta shake this bug off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not pissed as a Castle fan, pissed as a person who works in this industry. You have NO idea how damaging or dangerous doing that can be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The person who gave it to you was not authorised to do that  either.  Whatever your issue was know that  other people there  know the truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No technically you did nothing illegal. But that is a production document. How would you feel if people released YOUR WORK information.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To the people who released Castle's Thursday Call Sheet. There is not enough space here to explain how STUPID that move was.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MLK333 @luv57bird @cnangel4ever me too :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angela_sherrill hahaha no just have the song in my head!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know deep down, I'm a coward Afraid to let you in But the only thing more frightening Is to say "What might have been?" So here I go<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bwaydoc um MINE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@77rocket @lisa_caputo I also love the heavy eps. And I am looking forward what has been set up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lisa_caputo I am not saying to much till it airs obviously but my biggest issue is I felt it rushed through it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lisa_caputo oh absolutely. And I am looking forward to talking with someone who enjoyed it &amp; see it from that side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lisa_caputo @77rocket I am so intrigued by your review Lisa as I was beyond disappointed with the premier. Will have to chat after Monday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn it, I just to want scream at people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Played it cool sitting across from @monicapotter in Malibu having lunch today but the #Parenthood fan in me lost her shit in the car outside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And if this is how #CastleSeason7 is going to go I may just be free on Monday nights from now on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daisycakes4 @cnangel4ever yes...in this case 10 is great 1 is don't be sad if your cable goes out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daracreasey Last Saturday I went from 75th from 39th in one go. Try that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#2014PremierSeason Bones premier 11 out of 10  Castle premier 1 out of 10. Next up Parenthood.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xfkirsten @cnangel4ever RIGHT!?! Why I try and stay out of most of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xfkirsten @cnangel4ever I know. And it is not just this fandom. But the situation was handled badly by both crew and fans yesterday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xfkirsten Yup. We were all good until a few asshats ruined it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks to the people who posted location pics from yesterday and not only let spoilers out but pissed off the crew. Good work. #SuckIt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@biermann Just touched down in LA for a week of debauchery and food.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love that I bought the shirt for what has become my fave song from #If/Then #HereIGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The bathroom in this airport is also a designated tornado shelter. #WTF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Back in Colorado for a while...more time to find the #Stargate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LipstkAdvntr We have a LOT to get started on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LipstkAdvntr How did it go by so fast? #BurberryZombie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meeting my @lipstkadvntr for coffee in Mamhattan like it ain't no thing. #Dream #BurberryZombie #Onedaythiswillbethenorm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beyond thrilled to have met @albinokid tonight after being a fan from #AdventuresInBabySitting until #If/Then Thanks for saying hi!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did I meet the entire cast of #If/Then why yes...yes I did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bwaydoc oh thanks love! I thought that was it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PEOPLE WHERE IS THE IF/THEN STAGE DOOR!?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever @Castle_ABC @ABC_Publicity true. but a week out they have really done nothing to promote it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever yup @Castle_ABC &amp; @ABC_Publicity have really dropped the ball for #Castle this season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chilling in my hotel before getting ready for #If/Then and the excitement is growing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever sweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CleverDever  Oh thanks Juliana. @cnangel4ever and I have 2 special dinners we need to plan. Rec from a local would be awesome!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@evilapprentice @cnangel4ever @loteriagrill I am down!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luv57bird @cnangel4ever @mlk333 beyond delighted for this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think my Netflix is defaulting to the US content here under my account and it is GLORIOUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mysterygrip @MysteryCr8tve Intrigued and terrified at the same time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mysterygrip @MysteryCr8tve  Had a 1st AD refer to entire (union) background as something that sounds like other truckers once on open chan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mysterygrip @MysteryCr8tve And every PA has been asked to radio for xxxx and played roulette with the channels.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cecimartin wait... Stan... sure typing fingers good work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cecimartin @Stana_Katic I feel like Stan missed a prime smart ass opportunity here...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@altravelproject @stana_katic on vacation in Manhattan and have done it all #ATPStyle so far #ATPpro<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At #ChelseaPiers trying to get a glimpse of @Mariska to make this the ultimate vacation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MysteryCr8tve I have a list of 4 people I feel this about. I work my ads off not only for myself but to keep that chance possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LipstkAdvntr @THOMASSABO but so SHINY!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Totally inducted @LipstkAdvntr into the @THOMASSABO club today. I suspect her credit card will hate me soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LipstkAdvntr Will do!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LipstkAdvntr mum and dad are seeing love letters at the same time and I found a 3rd row ticket so buying it in the morning! #stagedoorYES<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StephanieJBlock Thank you for being so kind to me today! Was a absolute delight to meet you!  http://t.co/KjrLNIKWuH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks to @LipstkAdvntr and @StephanieJBlock for making my first #BroadwayFleaMarket so wonderful.  http://t.co/Yb9Hp0Tp3E<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Manhattan is beautiful. There is an energy to NYC that can't be contained or competed with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BACK IN THE LAND OF WIFI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Must...do...stuff!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever Sometimes scarily so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First thing to so on vacation clean the house. *sings* I'm so fancy...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever Will fill you in in 5 just about to log on ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And THIS is why when the show ends she is going to vanish into the far corners of Europe and never come out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mminpgh Not on a high horse,  no way think she is perfect, you are being rude. She gets 1000 tweets a minute, how can she answer them all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @stana_katic we are all set to make #ElephantWinter soar. Check out @EWinterFilm  :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mminpgh come on now no need for trolling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@castle_examiner I had a pretty intense sandwich at lunch...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am on vacation. Yes I am.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@castletasmic Such a fun day right!?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JewelStaite  @cnangel4ever and I may be ableb to hook you up with this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just saw a cinema broadcast of Streetcar with @GillianA and HOLY BALLS what magic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahWatson42 Could be something as simple as dust/dirt in his nose or an allergy. If you are in LA it may also be the hot weather.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Castletasmic uh oh not again with the stupid people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever I am loading up the kindle with the them all. I have a lot of travel time coming up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To kindle or hardcopy, that is the question.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@angela_sherrill @Castle_Examiner Stay strong! I too have reached my desired preknowledge level. though my TL is pretty awesome/considerate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ALTravelProject  @Stana_Katic Was there any doubt? We support causes like we do fandoms - all in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Castletasmic From what I have heard I am already 10 times more excited for this season than last. #Can'tWait<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@His_Squadron_Of  Delighted you are back. Your work is a daily dose of "look what is possible" inspiration. All my thanks.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LeaKThompson You were WONDERFUL! Ginger, Fred and Gene would vote for you. Shall be cheering you on weekly with joy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think I shall curl up with an episode of Castle, but which one!?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angela_sherrill Sorry answered you from the wrong account..how many times will I do that now!?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So...I did a thing. I would love it if you followed my new account @EWinterFilm  All things Elephant Winter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xfkirsten Of course they are. Seriously we get the episode in 2 weeks...really we can deal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xfkirsten I haven't seen anything bad, just talk of a clip that appeared then was gone now is apparently back in shitty form.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xfkirsten That makes SO much more sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Castle people - Was there only 1 sneak peek released?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FelicPlunkett @StuartABarnes Hello from across the pond!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today I feel like this crazy path I have put myself on may just work out. Funny how 7 minutes can reboot your brain. #Stana&amp;Mark<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angela_sherrill Are you an Apple fan? I can give you some ideas for others if you wanted to shop around other brands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope all those people who were saying Mark should not have been on set are choking on their words right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever I literally have played line at least 15 times over...mainly trying to remember it to type it lol but yes, Stana gut punch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Sometime time ends up being a friend though, too. It forces you to find other ways to get places."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LipstkAdvntr My heart wasn't ready for this. You and @cnangel4ever will understand.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever Heading to the gym in an hour or so though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever Well...I kinda ate that already. Between the pile of craft clean up and the minor freak out before I think I am stuck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sadly don't think I am making it to the lake. Should have gone first thing. #DayIsGettingAwayFromMe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katherinefugate This industry is a workplace like any other, your reputation can end up being your resume.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The "office" side of bedroom designed to motivate and inspire creativity.  http://t.co/XbfO9LTieh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@livwilder2 @ERAlban Yup. Nailed it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever @Sandraxf ??? You didn't show me any of them! I knew people were just angry who were not there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angela_sherrill @cnangel4ever @livwilder2 @ERAlban Tis one of only 2 fics I am reading right now. It is amazing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sandraxf @cnangel4ever Yep, I also can see she was probably offended by so many tweets she really didn't care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever @Sandraxf Oh absolutely Nikki. But again it was that shitty small % of fans that did that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sandraxf @cnangel4ever Totally agree. Was a little tactless. They knew it was coming. Have they SEEN this fandom?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever @Sandraxf Yeah that hashtag was...questionable. What do you think happens when you throw steak at Piranhas?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnangel4ever @Sandraxf I was ticked off by the initial shenanigans over it. Like really? We see them in the bedroom. We KNOW what happened!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just had WAY too much beer to be considered ladylike for a Monday night.  But it is my Friday so suck it! #Loophole<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Check the chicken!" might be the best euphemism yet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisrwoodard You fail at twitter if you don't follow me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Having a beer for dinner...like a grown up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aobajohsai what about my con selfies woman????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaxiBrooklyn How Bro-mantic!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@xfkirsten HA! Nice! Not sure about Castle Con yet.  Big vacation end of this month so I may not be able to swing the time sadly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xfkirsten I am so sad now :( going to have to see if I can swing it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xfkirsten I just saw how much the registration fee is *MY HEART*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xfkirsten OMG really? I was going to do the 5k but sold out and I realised I do that on the treadmill anyway so I need to push myself!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xfkirsten I wanna register for the Tinkerbell Half Marathon!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just dropped grilled tomato on my Castle calendar...yup.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chy_leigh If you could go back in time and tell your younger self something would you and what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LexipediaLeigh I mean, I have happy danced over a few tweets I have got but man...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Am I just old or does seeing someone respond to a tweet from a celebrity "OMFG I AM SHAKING CRYING I CAN'T STOP" drive anyone else nuts?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty sure you are legally required to give me my pay slip...wtf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #FrankieAndCat in tonight's #TaxiBrooklyn is laugh out loud wonderful!<|endoftext|>
