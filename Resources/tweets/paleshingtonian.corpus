<|startoftext|>@daveixd @nick_w_estes Progress needs to be foresighted &amp; inclusive. Which means change needs to take into account the people now resisting it. It’s not easy &amp; it should not be impulsive. If it is either or both of these things, then something is wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daveixd @nick_w_estes I understand. My issue is with the notion of dealing with what presents itself rather than proactively building the narrative for change. That is reactive, it still follows the centers of power. Progress is done through proactive advocacy, education &amp; grassroots activism. 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daveixd @nick_w_estes Real change comes through ending impunity of the oppresser &amp; Justine through systemic restructuring, with conciliation &amp; reparations.

<|startoftext|>@MSNBC @maddow #Republicans are absolutely fine with #Trump’s legendary incompetence. Because preservation of the live &amp; livelihood of the nation was never in their presidential criteria. Preservation of the conservative systems of classism, racism &amp; religious fanaticism is all they stand for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FranciscanMon Amen 🙏🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaseChristophe2 @MSNBC @anniekarni Yes /No question: Are you serious?   (I know I’m gonna regret this🤦🏽‍♂️)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSNBC @anniekarni So stop pointing finger at this total imbecile &amp; start blaming the people who are Absoloutly thriving since they put him in the Oval Office.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSNBC @anniekarni #Republicans are absolutely fine with #Trump’s legendary incompetence.

<|startoftext|>@thehill I can’t wait to talk to my students about the worst strategic adviser in the history of the White House. I’m just waiting for this administration to be replaced, so I can build a full historic survey. We’ll make sure to anchor imbeciles like her in the dumpster of history.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rogerfederer No way! I can think of several  https://t.co/nzNGgGLe4N<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSanders @SecPompeo @stevenmnuchin1 Shouldn’t that be contingent on Iran stopping fighting in Syria? I know you’re trying to be humane, but sometimes we need the bigger picture &amp; Iran is killing Syrians daily. Withdrawing Hizbolah from Syria should be the least Iran must do if it wants to save its citizens.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AOC Dear @aoc you know that’s Reps &amp; Dems alike. The US needs a third party that represents the working class. You &amp; Sanders managed to build on the grassroots level. To think that you’d still be able to serve a progressive agenda under the Dem party is uncharacteristically naive.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dwnews Great work DW, I like your reporting 👍🏽<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dwnews What is really unfortunate is that the EU as a system does have the instruments to hold its members accountable for these kinds of abuses, but it never uses them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@washingtonpost Actually most people of all backgrounds know he’s the most electable of the whole bunch of candidates. But clearly you represent the dinosaurs of the corporate owned Democrats who think they can still shift public opinion with lies. You don’t anymore. Go home, retire in peace.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MSNBC Trump must be Democratic Party Trojan horse, who infiltrated the Republican Party to discredit all its representatives &amp; destroy its legitimacy? Because seeing it from that angle, he’s doing a phenomenal job!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The excessive use of superlatives became a linguistic plague caused by some dull moron called Donnie Trump. I will never forgive whoever made the douchbag a public figure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamalDajani @jstreetdotorg @AIPAC @jvplive Good luck achieving anything by convincing the convinced. As a Palestinian not American, I’ll speak to whoever has the genuine will to change the status quo. But what do I know, I have zero followers :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notcapnamerica Come on people! Just #DeleteFacebook &amp; opt out of this moron’s data farm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill Her name is Jessica Cisneros @JCisnerosTX &amp; she is an outstanding human rights attorney.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSNBC Why is this prat making announcement concerning national intelligence risks. Facebook must be federally regulated. There’s no scenario where this prat, who is profit oriented, will do a better job protecting the integrity of the elections than the US intelligence agencies.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@postpolitics I’m grateful I met with this legend face to face. I know it’s possible to be a brilliant politician with a healthy moral compass thanks to people like Rep. Elijah Cummings. #RIPSir<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@washingtonpost How about you stop waisting donors money &amp; quit. They should buy herbal tea instead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fox5dc Not enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSNBC @JoeNBC White media defending white peoples who bond with war criminals because that’s “being nice”. Now take G.W Bush out of the picture, add O.J Simpson instead &amp; imagine their response for Ellen socializing with a filthy murderer. OJ Simpson allegedly killed 1, Bush killed 1 million.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill Well said. Israel (#1 US aid recipient) is about to indict its own prime minister for corruption, are you going to re-evaluate aid to Israel? Egypt has a corruption scandal exposed by one of the military contractors. Same? Why Ukraine? Why the Bidens? #RepublicansForImpeachment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DallasPD @ChiefHallDPD Whoever came up with this cover up scenario is stuck in the nineties. Killing someone then frame them as drug dealers, that’s so Clinton administration War on Drugs bs. It doesn’t work any more. Someone related to Guyger ordered this execution.  Do your job &amp; find who.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DallasPD @ChiefHallDPD Oh! Did they hurt your feelings?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ewarren @RashidaTlaib It’s heartbreaking to know of the horrific injustice those communities face. But, at the same time, it is a great privilege to live to witness great women like Ms. Tlaib &amp; Ms. Warren claim their place in leading their country to a better future for all. 🙏🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSNBC @JoyceWhiteVance Let’s break this down for Republican working-class families: the Trump admin helped the richest elite (not you) pay even less taxes, while they are waisting your tax dollars pursuing a personal vendetta of Trump against the rule is law of the USA. #RepublicansForImpeachment<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thehill @mattgaetz Withholding aid can be used to serve the US’s foreign policy. But here Trump withheld aid to be used as leverage while he asks this foreign state leader to get him dirt on his political opponent. Stop treating your constituency as a bunch of morons.  #RepublicansForImpeachment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill Just retire already! You’re everything that is wrong in this country. The policies you &amp; your husband cursed this country with are at the core of every injustice happening on every possible level.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheAtlantic @kgilsinan @GOP #RepublicansForImpeachment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheAtlantic @kgilsinan You are right @GOP , military aid recipients must be investigated for corruption; Saudi, Israel, Egypt &amp; UAE to name a few.  For example, why is Kushner boy participating in a Saudi economic forum on behalf of the American government?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC The police is a mafia of stupidity. This dumb move is an invitation for justice to be sought outside the rule of law. Terrifying to think of the consequences.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill  https://t.co/FcM2xE78Wo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thehill No, you came across as too corrupt &amp; too hypocritical, with a proven record of anchoring systemic racism in America.  You have “wrong side of history” written all over your legacy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mondoweiss @jjz1600 Who abandoned what? Come on people! I wish you see beyond your curated twitter feeds. No one is abandoning anyone. The discourse inside &amp; outside Israel is changing. As a result, agenda of supporters is changing. No one is abandoning Israel &amp; no one should use this terminology.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ewarren It is way bigger than this though!  This can’t be protected speech when he his wealth trumps the wealth of many sovereign countries &amp; he owns a platform that can be weaponized to wage a civil war.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@latimes Issa you better go home &amp; chill, Campa-Najjar got this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill There is using the office for personal gain. There is a proven attempt to ask for the help of a foreign leader to dig dirt on a political opponent; urging a foreign entity to meddle in the American presidential elections. #RepublicansForImpeachment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill Your president himself admitted to asking a foreign leader to investigate a political opponent of his &amp; your president provided the transcript to prove that. #RepublicansForImpeachment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HouseGOP @GOPLeader Value-centered Republicans are sick of defending thug-in-chief. You should support ending this embarrassing episode of the GOP history. #RepublicansForImpeachment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill Deliberate that after impeaching the traitorous president you elected as commander in chief<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill @GOPLeader Fair enough. Release the full whistleblower report. What are you scared of?  GOParrots<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill Immoral GOPeices of cagada, why don’t stop embarrassing yourselves?! No one is above the law. What your president did is unconstitutional.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OurRevolution Can a conservative practicing Muslim be considered progressive though?  This focus on politics of identity representation rather than policy based inclusion is going to harm the progressive movement, not benefit it.<|endoftext|>
