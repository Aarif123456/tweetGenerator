<|startoftext|>@Lexialex @davelawson35 In my opinion it differentiates the good Jews who respect their religion &amp; decent principles from the bad ones who abuse others in the name of their religion for political motives.

<|startoftext|>@0Calamity @r1tch2e Fuck the trolls<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TommyCorbyn @Keir_Starmer Helpless &amp; paralysed. @Keir_Starmer is feeble &amp; cowardly in his response, afraid to speak (unless he agrees?). This man isn‚Äôt fit for any office let alone a decomposing Labour Party<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Compare his recount of the plight of #Palestinians during the Nakba (catastrophe) from 1948 to that of the anti Palestinian racist current Israeli ambassador who told none other than BOD on a zoom call that the Nakba was ‚Äúan Arab lie‚Äù. Note BOD gives instructions to @Keir_Starmer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also kudos to Avi Shlaim, the British-Israeli historian who spoke about plight of Palestinians from the time they were ethnically cleansed by Israel in 1948 to the current prejudices they still face. Historical facts can‚Äôt be changed no matter how much anti Palestinians try.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>V.good of @Channel4News to allow young British #Palestinians speak about their experiences resulting from British colonialism that ultimately led to their expulsion from Palestine &amp; consequent current prejudices they face from biased media, politicians &amp; other bodies. Sad &amp; true<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmmarKazmi_ @andrewfeinstein @Keir_Starmer He doesn‚Äôt! He‚Äôs pathetic weak &amp; paralysed afraid to say the truth in case some figures he may need the votes of get upset! No ethics at all @Keir_Starmer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrewfeinstein Peace with Israel always goes hand in hand with giving weapons for peace! What a joke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skwawkbox Basically Starmer is v.scared the truth will destroy him &amp; his new Labour mafia, as it will when people realise the extent of the filthy games his lot played in undermining Corbyn &amp; Labour chances of winning government. Weak &amp; pathetic leader<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DerbyChrisW @JewishLabour They‚Äôre doing it on purpose cuz they hate Palestinians so much &amp; make a point of inviting new bent Labour leaders to confirm they can support their hate &amp; pay homage to apartheid Israel.

This is broken corrupt politics of a man &amp; group within @UKLabour who are controlled by a minority group with a clear unprincipled political agenda: drive out the left voices especially those who advocate justice for Palestinians<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Decent principled people are leaving this broken @UKLabour in droves bc of the rogue actions of @Keir_Starmer who has favoured the biased politically motivated views of a fraction of the Jewish community (mostly RW, pro Israel) over those of many more incl progressive left Jews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatieWhearty @fiorifan Principled move I don‚Äôt blame you. Labour is now a corrupt party run by the few for the few<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BBCNewsnight @BBCTwo @marievanderzyl The RW Israel lobby speaks: lies, propaganda, hype &amp; she knows it! Love to know which part of the Torah says it‚Äôs ok to lie! These people shame Judaism. Utter disgrace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Thelma_DWalker @johnmcdonnellMP @jeremycorbyn I don‚Äôt blame you Thelma bc this new Labour has become totally broken, rogue &amp; immoral run by external lobbies. I really hope a new decent socialist party is formed ASAP bc millions feel politically homeless now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melaniekmelvin Remember when Jess Phillips said the comment ‚ÄúPalestine lives‚Äù made against a remark by Joan Ryan was antisemitic! Neither are Jews but both are lobbyists for apartheid Israel. That‚Äôs how ridiculous &amp; broken our politicians have become<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melaniekmelvin Of course not but they‚Äôre making a deliberate attempt to conflate so as to silence critics of those immoral lying MP‚Äôs like Hodge who happens to be Jewish.

<|startoftext|>Timely reminder in the midst of the pandemic &amp; millions suffering in UK the 1st thing @Keir_Starmer did was bow down to @JewishChron : a publication that‚Äôs lied multiple times about people labelling them antisemitic only to apologise later!

<|startoftext|>@harriepw Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AaronBastani It was @jeremycorbyn‚Äôs idea! And that‚Äôs the tragedy of the failure that is Starmer. Maybe he‚Äôs just an implant for the Tories!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Millions of bright promising young people inspired into the politics of fairer more just society &amp; world by @jeremycorbyn will have today looked at @Keir_Starmer‚Äôs actions in disgust.

<|startoftext|>@silverrich39 @Z_Beeb As an honorary resident witch!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Anyone still taking about reconciliation &amp; unity in @UKLabour or let‚Äôs move on nonsense really doesn‚Äôt appreciate the extent of corruption within that party held by the throat by the rotten RW faction &amp; Israel lobby.

<|startoftext|>4) I honestly believe this ridiculous bogus antisemitism crisis which today reached peak of absurdity will begin the demise of @UKLabour under this rotten new leadership.

<|startoftext|>3) millions of people who were inspired by the decent ideals of @jeremycorbyn must now be in shock. The younger generation will look back at this tragic dark chapter in @UKLabour &amp; say how &amp; when did this party become so corrupt &amp; broken &amp; why was @Keir_Starmer so compromised<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2) @Keir_Starmer today literally stuck his 2 fingers up ag millions of people in the UK told them to F off, their beliefs don‚Äôt matter &amp; that he‚Äôs willing to sell out to serve the interests of a few smear campaigners. Any notion of decency he‚Äôs pretended so far have now vanished<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1) @Keir_Starmer‚Äôs claim of fighting antisemitism by demonising @jeremycorbyn is a lie &amp; he knows it.

<|startoftext|>Some woman called Marie from BOD this morning on @BBCr4today spewed such appalling lies &amp; smears ag Corbyn it was repulsive to hear.

<|startoftext|>@addmoooo @AsaWinstanley Broken ethics &amp; compromised<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Clear now @jeremycorbyn must seek legal action bc @UKLabour under @Keir_Starmer is compromised &amp; run by a minority Israel lobby faction who hate Corbyn bc he supports Palestinian rights &amp; NOTHING to do with antisemitism. #IStandWithJeremyCorbyn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Basically you listened to the #Israel meddling destructive lobby to help destroy a man they hate PURLEY bc he supports Palestinian rights. Period.

<|startoftext|>You do NOT represent the Jewish community.. sorry to burst your selfish bubble but you know that already. Much as you dislike to admit many Jews like &amp; fully support #JeremyCorbyn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope some Labour MP‚Äôs resign the whip over Corbyn bc it‚Äôll expose the liars, smear campaigners &amp; those who had a vindictive politically motivated agenda against him. Let‚Äôs go. #JeremyCorbyn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KateEMcCann Really? Which Jewish community? There are many &amp; many Jews support Corbyn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2. Then @BBCNews goes on to say ‚Äúthe Jewish community may feel dismayed‚Äù! Which Jewish community? There are many &amp; many support Corbyn while some outspoken pro Israel dominant figures dislike him bc he supports Palestinian rights. The power of MSM bias is powerful &amp; dangerous!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some propaganda &amp; hype just disseminated by @BBCNews re: #JeremyCorbyn re-admission into Labour:   1.uproar from HARD LEFT Corbynistas over suspension! Notice the language used, very skewed &amp; ignores the millions of all ordinary people who support Corbyn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welcome back @jeremycorbyn the country &amp; UK politics is better for having a principled man like you back. You were appallingly  &amp; unjustly treated by SO many.

<|startoftext|>@birdonthewing Absolutely. No one gives a toss about these liars. People just want a better life. Shame that our politicians &amp; MSM don‚Äôt pay as much attention to their lives as they do to smear campaigners!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3) history will also show the destructive power of the dark Israel lobby which has infested &amp; meddled in UK politics for far too long weaponising antisemitism to destroy &amp; subdue a man &amp; indeed the concept of advocating human rights for Palestinians, by anyone. This must end<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2) history will show the extent to which RW establishment along with servile MSM went to character assassinate Corbyn &amp; kill all notions of Socialism: fairer society, anti war, equality, justice etc. The level of human malice on show here is repulsive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1) Shortly #JeremyCorbyn will hear the judgment of the bogus antisemitism case against him based on lies &amp; smears manufactured by a combo of politically motivated liars.

<|startoftext|>@TheArabSource @aspals Good news<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveChappell9 Indeed. He‚Äôs not had the guts from day one to confirm exactly what he stands for always careful not to rock the establishment boat.

<|startoftext|>The Britain I knew didn‚Äôt have so many MP‚Äôs who lied &amp; smeared a decent genuine Labour politician like Corbyn with fake antisemitism under the influence of a lobby predisposed in favour of an apartheid state.

<|startoftext|>@MikeHun28954222 @larryelder Countries need to put Israel &amp; US on red alert terror lists for decades of illegal invasions, occupations. 000‚Äôs of innocents deaths etc. The 2 biggest terror countries on this planet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BJohnb181 I see what you mean. Yes some tribes don‚Äôt identify as Arabs like some in say Morocco like the Berbers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@larryelder Under threat: #Trump threatens to keep Sudan on terror list unless it normalises relations w/ apartheid #Israel ! Why was Sudan in terror list the 1st place &amp; how does normalisation remove it. Just proves these selective lists are a sham &amp; peace by threat isn‚Äôt peace. Cowboy USA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MalatestaCarina @kppotatoes This is despicable! So basically they‚Äôre killing 000‚Äôs of innocent civilians with direct support from US &amp; the price is a deal with apartheid Israel! Further proof the peace is a manufactured threat &amp; the price is continued needless bloodshed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BJohnb181 Yep.. various Arab countries are African .. good correction<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kppotatoes A joke &amp; disgrace. It‚Äôs like being forced to like your abusive bully neighbour who despite abusing you you‚Äôre forced to like by a stronger 3rd party!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#USA will at will add weaker countries to manufactured terror lists unless it acts subservient to it &amp; #Israel &amp; accept all their flagrant abuses. This isn‚Äôt achievement by @realDonaldTrump but bully tactics by 2 aggressive rogue states which violate int law. A total sham!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Am sure similar threats were made against vassal states like #UAE &amp; #Bahrain which incidentally holds the largest US naval base in Mid East. Threats aren‚Äôt a success by #Trump especially when the ultimate victims remains #Palestinians whose human rights continue to be abused!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Re: peace deal between #Sudan &amp; #Israel this is what happened: #Trump threatened Sudan it‚Äôll remain on terror list unless it normalises relations w/Israel. This isn‚Äôt normalisation but bully tactics against a poor Arab country to force it to like apartheid Israe! Peace by threats<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chrissie_trice1 You are right it just baffles me that people fall for them or take them seriously!

<|startoftext|>@simonmaginn @JewishChron That shit smearing publication needs to close down, total sewer house<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Am definitely not a fan of this #Tory gov but for @UKLabour &amp; @Keir_Starmer to come out criticising everything without giving any real credible clear viable honest alternative plans as opposed to vacuous rhetoric doesn‚Äôt make them the alternative.

<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer @irene89383961 And what exactly would you propose as a viable better plan? All we hear is vacuous rhetoric with no viable credible alternative. Put your ideas forward don‚Äôt just talk!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WarmongerHodges 100% right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JewishChron He was talking about the illegal theft of #Palestinian land to settle illegal Israeli settlers. What‚Äôs wrong with that? Don‚Äôt you understand &amp; support international law or are you full supporters of Israeli crimes??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SakrRuth Never<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doug1e661 @mirabarhillel @BorisJohnson @Keir_Starmer You‚Äôve got a point there. Am convinced they groomed Starmer precisely for this sort of scenario so we never have the alternative! Another reason why they destroyed Corbyn so as not to destroy the old guard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@macklamm @BorisJohnson @Keir_Starmer They‚Äôre all corrupt the bastards. Only dodgy corrupt politicians make them happy cuz they‚Äôre in it together<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So while @BorisJohnson gives top jobs &amp; contracts to friends &amp; close contacts we have @Keir_Starmer seeking funding from wealthy donors, no doubt for later favours (he knows he‚Äôs not popular like Corbyn with ordinary public). This is the sad state of our politics in 2020!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gabriel_Pogrund @EleniCourea Yet more proof @Keir_Starmer is an establishment tool.

<|startoftext|>@FreeGaza2010 You too :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jackcharlt My point being is Saddam was allowed to be a monster with his neighbours with the full knowledge &amp; support of NATO countries, till he got too big &amp; sought full independence of US hegemony &amp; that‚Äôs when the plug was pulled<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jackcharlt A lot of Iraqis believe he was encouraged to invade Iran you‚Äôre right as he was made to think the Shiite majority in Iraq would back Iran after the Ayotollah Khomenie started the revolution in Iran. Khomenie grew up in Iraq, disliked Saddam &amp; Saddam felt threatened. US knew that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>US never did nor does now care about anyone in Mid East despite its rhetoric of human rights &amp; freedoms etc. It uses states &amp; their heads as a chess game to further &amp; perpetuate its interests. It robbed Iraq of its wealth &amp; note how it‚Äôs now occupied Syrian oil fields!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The big anti Saddam war-push came only after Saddam threatened to take over Kuwait‚Äôs oil fields &amp; that threatened US oil interests. Another factor was Saddam threatened to reduce reliance on US $. Only then did the righteous American rhetoric kick in. Same in Libya !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moreover other NATO countries supplied Saddam mustard gas which he used to bomb not only Iranians but also Kurds. At that time NATO took no action while Iraq was fighting Iran. He was then, if you like, a proxy regional useful ally they needed to fight Iran!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The dispute between Iraq &amp; Kuwait was over oil fields. Iraq had just come out of an 8 year war with Iran bankrupt: worth reminding that war that was fully backed militarily by UK, US &amp; France etc who armed Saddam fully to help destroy Iran. Geopolitics was &amp; still plays a part<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On anniversary of the #Iraq invasion of #Kuwait it‚Äôs worth noting that the then US foreign diplomat April Glaspie told Saddam Hussein ‚ÄúUS will not interfer in these affairs‚Äù. They waited till he invaded &amp; as Iraqi army agreed to retreat US bombed 000‚Äôs of soldiers in cold blood!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FromSteveHowell @BBCr4today Because clearly #BBC which was instrumental in the Get Corbyn plot wouldn‚Äôt want to have anyone debunk the lies &amp; smears which the BBC itself was a major mouthpiece for. @BBCr4today let‚Äôs be totally clear &amp; honest here since MSM currently lack much ethics &amp; morality<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@eddiedoch @mirabarhillel @jeremycorbyn @UKLabour I know it is but I truly believe are fed up of the same old.

<|startoftext|>@trendylefty @jeremycorbyn Love it. Just imagine the power of a party by the people for the people! No wonder they were all so afraid of him hence all the smears<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well said. The vast support for @jeremycorbyn is the real dynamic reflection of anger &amp; frustration by the masses feeling robbed of a hope that was Corbyn, for a better world and a protest against all the corrupt people in politics,MSM &amp; lobbies that robbed them of that potential<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I truly hope @jeremycorbyn starts a new party. Millions would follow &amp; 000‚Äôs would leave that fast rotting current @UKLabour under Starmer &amp; his compromised corrupt lot.

<|startoftext|>@natchorules @jeremycorbyn Naturally they fought him. Very much like the mafia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boris Johnson said Jews control elections &amp; media &amp; he‚Äôs never once been confronted with that by anyone. Corbyn never said anything like this yet he was attacked by many. His only crime was criticising apartheid Israel. This is how corrupt UK politics &amp; MSM are now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@natchorules @jeremycorbyn Thank you very kind:) we need a revolution to collapse this corrupt system. I was hoping Covid would teach the human race some humanity but I was wrong!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>.@jeremycorbyn inspired millions to dream about a better world. He was viciously attacked by those who wanted to maintain a broken one at our expense. Please show him your support.

<|startoftext|>@IanLaveryMP @jeremycorbyn I concur 100% &amp; all those politicians &amp; amateur wannabe journalists who‚Äôve smeared @jeremycorbyn are the most morally corrupt vile people on this planet. He held a mirror to their rotten reflection &amp; they hated him for it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulOnBooks @mojos55 They all have one thing in common: their love &amp; support of the racist ethnic cleansing apartheid state of Israel  https://t.co/VTGLiy7vmc<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Armstrong141 @skill5111 @RosieDuffield1 @CarolinePenn2 @Keir_Starmer Corbyn &amp; allies cared about the poor etc. Those now in power pretend but really don‚Äôt. You‚Äôre right they sold their souls to power<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Armstrong141 @skill5111 @RosieDuffield1 @CarolinePenn2 @Keir_Starmer Good analysis. Corbyn‚Äôs mistake was to give way to plotting centrists on Brexit bc that‚Äôs what really lost them the votes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Armstrong141 @Fanxxxxtastic Good point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Armstrong141 @skill5111 @RosieDuffield1 @CarolinePenn2 @Keir_Starmer Boris &amp; co have rendered Labour almost obsolete as an opposition. Interesting what you say about stealing centrists. They already employed some of the easily bent like John Mann &amp; Ian Austin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This really is cowboy style State terrorism by USA against #China !What a disgrace that country is. Daily it sinks lower. Imagine if China had broken into an American consulate, the warmongers would be greasing their missiles by now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Underground_RT @zeerlin12 @Keir_Starmer @MaxBlumenthal Max is spot on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Armstrong141 @skill5111 @RosieDuffield1 @CarolinePenn2 @Keir_Starmer He knew he was hated after the Iraq genocide &amp; yes all downhill with financial crash. He was by then exposed as corrupt &amp; beyond repairs besides he served the purpose for which he was groomed so his time was up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Armstrong141 @Fanxxxxtastic I hear you but I really think he can use this opportunity to galvanise the support of millions of disaffected angry people who feel they were robbed of a decent government otherwise it‚Äôs back to square one &amp; the usual abyss. Worth a fight. People have had enough of this circus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Armstrong141 @skill5111 @RosieDuffield1 @CarolinePenn2 @Keir_Starmer True also, as was the case with Blair etc &amp; many before him from both parties<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Armstrong141 @skill5111 @RosieDuffield1 @CarolinePenn2 @Keir_Starmer True about less subtle. I guess it‚Äôs all just dressed up in shiny suits &amp; vacuous righteous rhetoric ‚Äúas a leader I‚Äôll do this &amp; that for you‚Äù nonsense. I referenced 3rd world ref: e.g Gaddafi etc his time was up when he challenged the petro $, look what they did to him !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Armstrong141 @Fanxxxxtastic Truly hope so, then we can start our own party with Corbyn &amp; decent allies running it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Armstrong141 @skill5111 @RosieDuffield1 @CarolinePenn2 @Keir_Starmer Establishment &amp; secret intel etc have been grooming him since 2013 or so. He‚Äôs close to them &amp; will do what they tell him. They‚Äôll tolerate him so long as he toes the line &amp; take him out if not. Exactly how puppet regimes work in 3rd world countries it‚Äôs just more subtle here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Political parties rely on member money &amp; stealth wealthy donors (money for favours=corrupt) to survive. If a few 000‚Äôs decent socialists can donate over ¬£250k to support @jeremycorbyn in few hours imagine the fortitude of such a party wholly funded by millions of us. Let‚Äôs do it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhillipsBarrie  https://t.co/qBGCi6kmIz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WarmongerHodges No cuz she‚Äôs too morally depraved to do so! Part of the Get Corbyn hate mob acting on behalf of apartheid Israel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedRosa91940184 Starmer knows v.well but he‚Äôs part of the smear game. He‚Äôs been groomed to lead!

That‚Äôs how compromised he is &amp; always will be<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Israeli parents tell their kids all Arabs are terrorists &amp; it‚Äôs ok to kill them. Israeli tourism run shooting ranges for Americans where Arab figures are used as targets conditioning racist hate. How about that for reciprocity for your apartheid state? Your paper is truly vile<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apartheid in South Africa did it, segregation of black people in USA did this &amp; now apartheid in #Israel are doing it! A running theme of inherent racism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump spent the last 4 years financing &amp; supporting #Israel‚Äôs illegal occupation &amp; theft of #Palestinian land. @Keir_Starmer ‚Äúthe barrister‚Äù has just made it a policy to call any critics of Israeli law violations antisemitic. 2 morally corrupt leaders controlled by Israel lobby<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NumberMonkey69 @Keir_Starmer @WorkersPartyGB Me too. The last thing I‚Äôll vote for is a morally corrupt party controlled by the venomous Israel lobby working for the foreign interests of an apartheid state<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomLondon6 The same happened days before the Israeli racist Nation State Bill which confirmed that only Jews have the right to self determination in Israel I.e almost half the population of Arabs have no such right. It was then &amp; now timed so no criticism takes place!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martinjhamer @rogersurfacings Don‚Äôt blame your @UKLabour has become corrupt &amp; compromised. Bought &amp; sold by the sinister &amp; destructive apartheid Israel lobby<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Except for when it comes to #Palestinian human rights &amp; criticism of apartheid #Israel , its illegal occupation, land theft &amp; racist policies then you have instructions to call that antisemitism! Hypocrite &amp; double faced weak leader<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MoeRosh @Keir_Starmer @UKLabour You‚Äôre right there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanLaveryMP @RLong_Bailey Me too &amp; anyone else victimised by the fatal Israel lobby &amp; by default the supine @Keir_Starmer : he really is a pathetic leader<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BoardofDeputies @BoDPres But it‚Äôs a fact &amp; you know that. Your current role now is nothing but to lobby for apartheid #Israel &amp; stifle criticism of its crimes. That @Keir_Starmer &amp; @UKLabour should entertain your pathetic &amp; sinister influence is a disgraceful milestone in UK politics. Shame on you all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh by the way don‚Äôt expect @Keir_Starmer to criticise the imminent annexation (theft) of #Palestinian land by the racist #Israeli gov on 1st July: he‚Äôs been controlled so much by the Israel lobby precisely to ensure no criticism takes place in case he gets smeared w/antisemitism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Piers agrees with @Keir_Starmer that criticising the crimes of apartheid Israel is antisemitic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Flymetovenus1 @PhillipsBarrie Livid with the enslavement of @UKLabour &amp; it‚Äôs current supine weak &amp; pathetic puppet that is @Keir_Starmer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Entities acting as lobby for apartheid #Israel thank @Keir_Starmer for firing anyone in @UKLabour who criticises Israeli crimes &amp; hence by association advocating #Palestinian human rights.

<|startoftext|>@BoardofDeputies @BoDPres @Keir_Starmer On behalf of apartheid Israel BOD thx Starmer for firing anyone criticising Israeli crimes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2018 #Israel introduced a racist Nation State Bill stating only Jews have a right to self determination there. Now they‚Äôre abt to steal massive chunks of #Palestinian land. Then/now UK Israel lobby upped antisemitism smears: to stifle critics of their crimes! #RebeccaLongBailey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SalmaYaqoob @marimaasikas330 @Keir_Starmer Very well said Salma. @Keir_Starmer has proved to be a pathetic lobby controlled leader with dubious morals. His position is untenable. I honestly think a leadership challenge must take place or he‚Äôll ruin the already decomposing @UKLabour under his supine leadership<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArtCrunchy Agreed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WaymolWazza @Keir_Starmer The man is a joke. Total puppet! He had to sell himself to become leader. That was the deal ‚Äúleave Israel alone, sack all those who criticise its crimes &amp; we‚Äôll not move MSM &amp; politicians against you‚Äù!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Corruption in British politics used to be subtle &amp; implicit. Now under #Labour‚Äôs centrist mob they‚Äôve glorified corruption &amp; submission to foreign interests so much that its hard to distinguish them from a paid-for marketing company or worse, mercenaries. Time for a new party<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For a prominent member of JLM to come out &amp; say #RebeccaLongBailey is antisemitic bc she said so is also concrete evidence if ever you wanted one that the Israel lobby has indeed used the veil (trick) of antisemitism as a card to smear, stifle &amp; influence British politicians<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the avoidance of doubt,fatal US police tactics were indeed taught by #Israeli police as in #GeorgeFloyd so for  @Keir_Starmer to sack #RebeccaLongBailey for saying so is further evidence of the enslavement of #Labour by Israel‚Äôs lobby stifling criticism of the apartheid state  https://t.co/g2CV0uFbzH<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NeilHarding @ChrisPParks @UKLabour @Keir_Starmer @jeremycorbyn I agree with you he should‚Äôve been much tougher. He allowed way too many deviants get away with their deliberate destructive sabotage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don‚Äôt agree with much of what Andrew says but he‚Äôs right on @UKLabour Centrist faction‚Äôs stance on Brexit which really cost them the election, under @Keir_Starmer‚Äôs advice.

<|startoftext|>@nazirafzal @maureen12485368 Totally agree. Why that hateful racist was given platform in UK media then allowed to spread lies &amp; hate on Twitter for so long is beyond me<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>MSM, RW wing lobbies &amp; politicians spent 4 years lying about @jeremycorbyn &amp; 000‚Äôs of his @UKLabour supportive members precisely to destroy their chance of winning a gov then they blame them for losing! UK media truly is a laughing stock &amp; source of corruption in our society<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PickardJE Perhaps bc they were bewildered at the deluge of lies disseminated by MSM, RW lobbies, politicians etc over 4 years in a long smear campaign that was designed to undermine a decent socialist leader &amp; his 000‚Äôs of supporting @UKLabour members simply to destroy them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mail on Sunday and MailOnline apologise and pay damages to Palestinian Return Centre over Tom Bower libel.

<|startoftext|>Hi @Ed_Miliband @LucyMPowell : did you highlight the corruption exposed in #LabourLeaks ? Or question the integrity of those MP‚Äôs now sitting on @UKLabour front benches that spent years smearing @jeremycorbyn &amp; 000‚Äôs of loyal members?If not then you‚Äôve already lost! @Keir_Starmer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LabourTogether Does it include content of sabotage by @UKLabour staffers &amp; MP‚Äôs found in the #LabourLeaks ? I suspect not &amp; if not then this report isn‚Äôt worth the paper if you can‚Äôt root out the rot within Labour that spent years undermining Corbyn &amp; dehumanised members &amp; still does! Joke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>8) the fact of the matter remains: Corbyn held a mirror to the rotten reflection of the destructive elements within not just Labour but Westminster &amp; establishment itself &amp; they all hated him for it. @UKLabour has once again failed to see or admit why they lost! Sham of a report<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>7) if @UKLabour thinks it can now win back the red wall or those disillusioned voters by scapegoating @jeremycorbyn &amp; not hold responsible the destructive people within it then the party has no hope of winning. People can see through these deflections. Time for a split<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>6) So disappointed in @Ed_Miliband &amp; @LucyMPowell for trying to blame @jeremycorbyn for a defeat that all their peers &amp; corrupt staffers were wholly responsible for. This is a reflection of their own shortcomings/refusal to admit that there‚Äôs a rotten core inside @UKLabour itself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>5) does the @UKLabour election review mention anywhere how Tory gov psy-ops like Inregrity Initiative &amp; every corrupt MSM tried their best to spread misinformation about @jeremycorbyn to character assassinate one of the most decent men in UK politics? Obviously not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4) #LabourTogether‚Äôs report worries they lost the red wall? It was those plotting centrist Blair-loving MP‚Äôs that crapped all over those disillusioned people with their Roman-senate like back-stabbing games they were more interested in than the ordinary people they now care for!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3) #Labour‚Äôs election review will obviously not mention how MP‚Äôs continuously pressured @jeremycorbyn into considering another Brexit vote/PV knowing full well it‚Äôll make him unpopular with voters whom they now suddenly regard as ‚Äúforgotten‚Äù &amp; need reaching out to ! Hypocrites<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2) #LabourTogether report will doubtless not mention how so many MP‚Äôs now elevated by @Keir_Starmer themselves spent years smearing @jeremycorbyn with lie after lie, putting obstacles along the way to stop him from becoming leader of a gov. The antisemitism lies &amp; hoax was as one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1) I‚Äôve not read the @UKLabour report on why it failed elections &amp; refuse to bc it‚Äôs bound to make me angry purely bc it‚Äôll fail to mention how Labour MP‚Äôs, staffers etc spent years undermining @jeremycorbyn &amp; themselves sow seeds of division &amp; chaos/lies purely to oust Corbyn<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CliffAskey A sign of corrupt governments: a pattern that‚Äôs been ongoing for decades!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BlackLivesMattter protests will hopefully be the tipping point to begin to end institutional racism but also a stark warning to all political elite that ordinary people‚Äôs lives must be improved across the board or they‚Äôll face unprecedented revolts so huge that may topple states<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The tremors this caused among political elite was huge.Equally Western govs are now witnessing a disenfranchised public that while rightly mainly angered by continuous racism experienced by people of colour it‚Äôs also an outpouring of collective anger against failed unjust systems<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#BlackLivesMattter protests have galvanised Int outcry against institutional racism &amp; so much more discrimination/injustices felt by millions fed up w/the system.

<|startoftext|>@Jonathan_K_Cook Successive UK politicians have bowed down so much to the disease that is the Israel lobby: intent on destroying anyone who supports Palestinian rights &amp; calls out Israeli crimes, that now our politicians are weak, submissive &amp; supine to sinister foreign interests.

<|startoftext|>@MGreenwoodWW It‚Äôs an awful shame that British politicians are afraid to tell the truth of the harm done to the very decent Jeremy Corbyn by the very indecent apartheid Israel lobby &amp; its mob simply because he was a genuine socialist who believed in Palestinian rights.

<|startoftext|>@aishaismad @otivar55 Me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jennieformby1 @OborneTweets @davidahearst Hear hear. We all know about the vile lies against Corbyn. Truly the dirtiest example of political &amp; media chapters in UK history.

<|startoftext|>Even the heavens were angry with US politics. Take the hint<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RespectIsVital She‚Äôs establishment friendly that‚Äôs why she got the job despite her unfit for purpose status.She also got the job bc she jumped on the distasteful bandwagon that Corbyn is racist which makes her as broken &amp; morally corrupt as many on Labour front bench.

<|startoftext|>@WW2HistoryGal @WClanSupport US MSM is largely broken, biased &amp; brainwashes people with hype, propaganda etc depending on political agenda.

<|startoftext|>@WW2HistoryGal @WClanSupport Politically it‚Äôs corrupt &amp; broken &amp; may continue to be as it‚Äôs controlled by unscrupulous lobbies.

<|startoftext|>@Robin42167323 @KeesvdPijl1 All I can &amp; want to do is expose US crimes non stop to remind &amp; hopefully inform people lest they forget what an evil machinery it is domestically &amp; around the world.

<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer Sorry about the typo I meant ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so‚Äù (about him having the spine).

<|startoftext|>@Simon69961815 My take on it is that she &amp; many more were demented inhumane beings that saw Iraqis as inferior, the enemy as it was conditioned into their limited intellect, so much so that they took pleasure in killing them.  Many more instances like that happened all over Iraq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robin42167323 @KeesvdPijl1 No mate not individual cases, mass casses. You‚Äôre refusing to accept the wider truth!

<|startoftext|>@susanmarandi I know what you mean. I was told that too but I wanted to explain to them there‚Äôs context &amp; pattern to this violence.

<|startoftext|>@wmeijer4 @paulrikmans She is a hideous person, another one responsible for killing so many innocent Iraqis. Shame she‚Äôs still alive but her presence serves to confirm that evil exists amongst us<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robin42167323 @KeesvdPijl1 Not all but 3 decades of US army crimes in Iraq cover a wide spectrum of that army all over Iraq with all sorts of heinous violations against people: raids, extra judicial killings, rape etc, dropping depleted uranium bombs maiming 000‚Äôs etc etc. List is endless<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@moe87b @snarwani There are so many sources you can google them all. The US gov even produced The Torture Report which while horrific it was redacted. But just read lots of articles from the web<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@frlhoernchen @NilsMelzer Indeed #FreeAssange : the reason he‚Äôs locked up is because he exposed just a fraction of US crimes against humanity in Iraq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beautype These crimes are deliberately hidden from knowledge while MSM &amp; politicians continue their mendacious propaganda about how glorious US overseas wars are &amp; how they bring freedom &amp; democracy etc. If people knew extent of death &amp; destruction there would be huge uproar am sure<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@XULQIMOON Lots of dirty games were played. The whole ISIS thing was fully financed &amp; armed by global &amp; regional powers for a much bigger objective.

<|startoftext|>@AnwarAdushe @nhannahjones The American bombs of ‚Äúfreedom &amp; democracy‚Äù that rained over Mid East over decades have brought nothing but subsequent tragedies for their people not to mention terrorism brought about by power vacuums &amp; disaffected angry people.

<|startoftext|>@julesm2014 I‚Äôve seen &amp; heard it too.. it‚Äôs disgusting. Someone was blatant about his racism against Aborigines I told him ‚Äúyour white ancestors were ex f..king convicts &amp; society rejects sent by ships to come here‚Äù.. that shut him up<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BlakeFerrell9 @TheVoiceSyria Thx. Many people were duped into believing US Gov rhetoric &amp; lies which they did on purpose to justify these crimes. Media were as corrupt &amp; culpable. And this is regardless of SunniShiite.. it‚Äôs everyone who suffered. It‚Äôs touching that you tried to help those suffering, kudos<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@susanmarandi Don‚Äôt worry I always do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlakeFerrell9 @TheVoiceSyria I take note. My tweet wasn‚Äôt just about Abu Ghraib but 3 decades of death &amp; destruction. The example I gave was just to illustrate a wider pattern of these crimes; whether bombings, raids &amp; many more crimes. I could go on for hours but am sure you‚Äôre aware of them all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ayodhya_refugee Stifling dissent was deliberate &amp; they used patriotic rhetoric to shut people up. It was a deliberate psychological tactic..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Occidentosis2 @johnnyjazzfan @georgegalloway Horrific crimes.. am aware of them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlakeFerrell9 @TheVoiceSyria Oh &amp; kudos to you for not partaking. I am also aware many like you refused, spoke out &amp; rebelled against their army. We are grateful to them üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlakeFerrell9 @TheVoiceSyria It wasn‚Äôt 6... it was hundreds &amp; thousands in that army that killed, humiliated &amp; destroyed. As an army member surely you must understand the wider gross violations committed by soldiers following orders. I am of Iraqi origin.. I know the extent of American crimes in Iraq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not that the incumbent ridiculous &amp; dangerous racist #Trump will be replaced by a saint but it‚Äôs always a matter of who‚Äôs less worse than the predecessor in American politics from a system that continues to produce broken &amp; corrupt leaders.

<|startoftext|>@AlexaSmithyaho2 @Eikonur Yes ignorance is easier on the conscience<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There‚Äôs a consistent running theme of white colonial settler states: subjugation, killing, humiliation &amp; systematic torture of the indigenous people they colonise, perhaps with the ultimate aim of ethnic cleansing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexaSmithyaho2 @Eikonur Some are unaware of the truth sadly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nellydoc96 @MohammedAli1908 I know, it was horrific &amp; sickening<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pp_pazzolini @amitkarsandas @georgegalloway That was one of the points I was making: it‚Äôs ok when crimes are inflicted on the ‚Äúothers‚Äù that politicians &amp; MSM brainwash them to think are the enemy. Now it‚Äôs hitting home the reality of their actions<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gunnerSama @broncoskolar Many people just accept what they‚Äôre fed on MSM without ever questioning it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maryam_xyz @georgegalloway These were some of the tortured humiliated innocent Iraqis in a prison accused falsely of terror etc but they were just ordinary citizens some or many of whom probably spoke out against the illegal invasion of their country by US<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1985adw @Lance63 Most power hungry politicians are psychopaths giving orders to unquestioning obedient soldiers. The world is full of them sadly!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gunnerSama @broncoskolar The leader of the free world has for long been the crime master unbeknown to many people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pigreen1 Absolutely. They too committed vile crimes. The fact UK army joined in the bombing &amp; destruction of Iraq based on WMD lies make them as culpable. When has UK politics not been servile to US crimes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WorkingClass___ @georgegalloway &amp; by murdering a million Iraqis, pillaging their resources &amp; destroying an entire sovereign state deliberately for geo politics that somehow excuses or paints over the heinous actions of US bc Iraq had a dictator anyway? No hypocrisy but a expose of heinous US crimes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeatmasterBW @MyBotswana Thank you I‚Äôll check it out now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dutxuri Thank you I‚Äôll look it up. So many crimes committed by USA it‚Äôs hard to keep up with them all. It‚Äôs everywhere<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@johnnyjazzfan @georgegalloway Oh gosh they were heinous crimes too. It shocks me how people overlook crimes committed by US overseas &amp; insist on seeing it as some sort of a righteous freedom protector or human rights champion.

<|startoftext|>@DEGOODSON3 And so much more criminality committed against innocent people by US!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheeDeadBoy @georgegalloway They‚Äôve been deliberately hidden from view for fear of people‚Äôs reaction. The truth has been largely sanitised from view in Western countries to uphold the ridiculous image that the West is a keeper of human rights etc<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@loveisbrilliant @mrplannings Yes it is, equally heinous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesjoe6111 Trump, Pompeo etc are evangelical zionists. Their love for Israel is governed by a ridiculous end of times prophecy that all Jews must gather in Israel to bring about the messiah then all Jews must convert to Christianity or be forever damned !

<|startoftext|>#EHRC is therefore not trustworthy. It sees fit to investigate the #antisemitism smear campaign designed to undermine Corbyn but not #Islamophobia against Tory party. No one trusts you now, clearly biased &amp; run by biased people. Utter joke of an entity. Unfit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EHRC Wow how interesting! But you were happy to initiate the mainly manufactured antisemitism investigation resulting from a dirty smear campaign to undermine Corbyn!

<|startoftext|>@penny38555832 @Keir_Starmer @UKLabour I disagree on every point you made. Labour is rotten &amp; corrupt now &amp; will not be electable. Your tweet is literally a smear so I suspect you were on the other dude! Don‚Äôt bother tweeting back I‚Äôll not waste my time with you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She &amp; others spent years smearing &amp; undermining Corbyn w/ fake antisemitism precisely for this moment. This is the watered down &amp; compromised version of fake Labour under lobby pressure! Enjoy @Keir_Starmer cuz not many members will stay on. Now you lot have your house of cards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@margarethodge &amp; this too Maggie! You lot spent years smearing &amp; undermining Corbyn &amp; allies. This decomposition of Labour under this awful new team is on you &amp; others. Many will leave &amp; seek a new cleaner movement free of liars &amp; saboteurs. This is the end of genuine Labour! Disgrace  https://t.co/kR9pPaFUJo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn Please start a new party. As we can all see unfolding Labour under Starmer &amp; Co is ruined &amp; compromised. All those millions you‚Äôve inspired will soon be disappointed when they see the decomposition of Labour under this RW group succumbing to lobby pressure. It is a hopeless case<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lewis_goodall Especially when the new Labour has completely succumbed to apartheid Israel lobby under Starmer which was the plot all along, lest people forget!  https://t.co/y24siWrS3v<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoanDevizes @AndyDavidHill @Keir_Starmer @UKLabour Oh yes I did too. Amazing how these trolls come out of no where !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JennieGenSec Big huge loss for Labour Jennie. I‚Äôve no doubt as we all know this was under pressure from Starmer &amp; his anti Corbyn mob. It‚Äôs a disgrace that Labour has been ruined by RW internal pressure &amp; lobbies like the Board of Deputies, EVERYONE knows that. Genuine Labour is dying fast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyDavidHill @Keir_Starmer @UKLabour Oh dear I hope that ridiculous tweet wasn‚Äôt too taxing on you. Save the few brain cells mate you might need them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Under @Keir_Starmer &amp; lobby pressure he‚Äôs destroyed Corbyn‚Äôs legacy &amp; allies. Many members hugely disappointed &amp; leaving. Starmer has succumbed to lobby meddling in UK politics. He‚Äôs compromised. End of @UKLabour folks &amp; back to Blairite rot! Big shame &amp; disgrace. #LabourLeaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer What a shame Labour staffers whom you‚Äôre protecting along with PLP made her life such a misery she‚Äôs had to leave!

<|startoftext|>@ApsanaBegumMP Well done international law must prevail. Israel must never be allowed to act as a rogue state as it has been by most Western governments. If they impose sanctions on Russia Iran etc for much less then apartheid Israel must suffer consequences too for continued land theft<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The same intel agencies that found WMD in Iraq, destroyed Libya based on lies &amp; secretly ran a Syria regime change via jihadi terrorists who were fully trained on American TOW missiles !

<|startoftext|>@johnrobertsFox The thing is America failed miserably to deal with a pandemic led by a stupid &amp; inept president &amp; admin whose priorities centre on bullying, sanctions, overseas wars etc. Your economy has proved to be fake &amp; now you‚Äôre looking to deflect your shortcomings onto others<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@2mediceWill @jeremycorbyn I know buddy. What puzzles me is on daily basis he says &amp; does more ridiculous &amp; dangerous things yet they blindly believe him! There‚Äôs only so much loyalty you can have after which a brain must kick in &amp; say enough!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is how #COVID__19 spreads: was waiting outside supermarket a couple walking by, woman sneezes into the air not covered while another couple right behind them!

<|startoftext|>@nigib1 @UKLabour @Keir_Starmer @lisanandy @labourpress @jeremycorbyn Poor guy has been beaten up so badly over his support but you‚Äôre right ! This is what they did to him for speaking up for Palestinian rights  https://t.co/utjjGtcGPd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come to think of it no @jessphillips &amp; so many others either! Hmm #PalestineLives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear @UKLabour why haven‚Äôt @Keir_Starmer &amp; @lisanandy signed this letter threatening sanctions against #Israel if it annexes Palestinian West Bank?

<|startoftext|>It looks great on the face of it but believe me UK politicians are mainly feeble &amp; will do nothing to sanction Israel. Vacuous words. For decades they‚Äôve supported Israel fully despite countless theft of Palestinian land. Most are pro apartheid Israel under lobby pressure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gilbert42167300 @IfNotNowOrg But unlike Israel, Arab countries didn‚Äôt ethnically cleanse Palestinians &amp; stole their rightful lands to settle illegal Israeli settlers! You forgot that little fact didn‚Äôt you? Among many other crimes by apartheid Israel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jvplive @SyksyRasanen @TimesofIsrael Hopefully there will be some justice for #Palestine having suffered 70 years of crimes by #Israel since global governments have failed so miserably &amp; indeed enabled fully these crimes through their support of an apartheid system<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs all the murderous US empire knows: death &amp; destruction.

<|startoftext|>@LauraMStuart9 But without large membership he‚Äôll be weakened. The only way to put pressure on this broken new Labour is if 000‚Äôs of members walk out &amp; seek a better new genuine labour socialist party. But will people wake up &amp; determined enough to change?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@leftyjew @Johnrashton47 @davidgraeber I hear you my friend.

<|startoftext|>@zarahsultana Sadly the UK is one of the biggest supporters of apartheid #Israel : daily it sees Israel confiscate Palestinian land, illegally occupy &amp; dehumanise them yet insists on call it an exemplary democracy.

<|startoftext|>Not surprising that those inside @UKLabour who spent years making up mendacious allegations of racism against Corbyn &amp; allies are themselves racists. The rot within Labour exposed further. Anyone saying let‚Äôs unit instead of fight, the answer is no! Expose, expel. #LabourReport<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShehabKhan So the same smear campaigners that spent years smearing Corbyn etc of racism are themselves disgustingly racist. Was only a matter of time till the truth got exposed about this dirty campaign<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sblissett999me1 @kv654321 Exactly my thoughts.

<|startoftext|>@SkyeCity_ Same<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Initial responses to the #LabourReport ‚Äúnot the right time‚Äù! How predictable using the virus as cover.

<|startoftext|>@RhonddaBryant There‚Äôs never a good time to expose the corruption of Labour PLP &amp; hierarchy is there?

<|startoftext|>Dear @jeremycorbyn everyone knows now #Labour RW/centrists etc worked hard to undermine you &amp; millions of your supporters. The party is broken w/many of them still in it.

<|startoftext|>@RichardBurgon Well said Richard. Keir Starmer has appointed most of the liars fully responsible for lying, smearing &amp; deliberately undermining Corbyn &amp; millions of supporters.

<|startoftext|>@RichardBurgon You did amazing. It‚Äôs Labour‚Äôs loss for not having a very decent man like you. This ridiculous purge of all of Corbyn‚Äôs closest allied is a huge mistake.

<|startoftext|>@georgegalloway @MoatsTV No @Keir_Starmer will not lead Labour into victory simply bc people don‚Äôt want a diluted establishment/foreign lobby friendly soft labour but one that is real genuine &amp; upholds socialist values &amp; will carry the voice of true Labour folks.

<|startoftext|>@TheLabourLeftie The UK has always supported this racist illegal occupying apartheid state immersed in crimes (much worse than South Africa).

<|startoftext|>@kath_k99 @shipa123 @red_black_cat Yes I know but why release a loose cannon &amp; follow him so closely knowing well he‚Äôd commit crimes &amp; be so near behind him waiting to attack as if anticipating an attack?

<|startoftext|>700k #Palestinians were ethnically cleansed by #Israel in 1948, none have a right of return.

<|startoftext|>7) @realDonaldTrump can‚Äôt even pronounce #Alaqsa Mosque calling it Aqua goes to show how ignorant he is.

<|startoftext|>2) the fact that @realDonaldTrump has gifted &amp; condoned the theft of so much #Palestinian land in West Bank to #Israel long recognised as Palestinian land makes this peace deal a terrible deal for Palestinians.

<|startoftext|>2) #Trump has invited only @netanyahu &amp; his rival Benny Gantz both of who are staunch anti #Palestinian in every possible way. Gantz who‚Äôs supposed to be more moderate is a big believer in #Israel‚Äôs illegal settlement aka ethnically cleansing Palestinians to house settlers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1) the Mideast peace deal proposed by the #Trump‚Äôs racist &amp; biased administration re: #Palestine #Israel is dead before it‚Äôs even released due to its very heavy bias towards Israel with no #Palestinians even invited to the discussions at the WhiteHouse. @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is an amazing fast response by #China but the way it was announced on @SkyNews was ‚Äúthey can do that bc they‚Äôre an authoritarian regime‚Äù! How disgusting is that!

<|startoftext|>@BenJolly9 Absolutely. Every recent gov has relied on people apathy. We have a moan but really do nothing.

<|startoftext|>@RichardBurgon I am afraid I‚Äôve no hope with Trump. He‚Äôll likely support more illegal settlements, normalise occupation &amp; basically favour Israelis to Palestinians without any indication for a Palestinian state. Trump is a racist like Netanyahu<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>3) what did Jackie Walker or Ken Livingston say that was antisemitic? Antisemitism is hate speech/action against Jews &amp; Judaism. Both of them did neither. Let‚Äôs be totally honest here .. your defaming them in an appalling manner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2) how is Jewish Labour Movement an honest broker? They smeared Corbyn &amp; supporters in the most appalling manner with baseless allegations. &amp; didn‚Äôt some of its members take advice from Israeli ambassador on how to smear Corbyn &amp; labour activists? Very unsuitable I‚Äôd say<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Greenpeace is on terror list? What the hell has happened to our country! It‚Äôs fast falling into a fascist state under this #Tory government mimicking everything #Trump does. This is a terrible trend folks. People need to act.. fast  https://t.co/TC0q2U5Uli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What @BBCNews @Channel4News @SkyNews won‚Äôt show you: how last week #Trump @realDonaldTrump threatened UK @BorisJohnson France &amp; Germany with tariffs unless they join him in destroying the #Iran nuclear deal. Remember that next time our clown minister says we need a Trump deal!  https://t.co/8k6d3233XB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrianHTweed Definitely enough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A million murdered #Iraqis many more in #Libya &amp; the jihadi terrorists you employed in #Syria are testament to the death &amp; destruction that is #USA ! A lying warmonger like you now has nothing better to do than provoke another Mid East regime change in #Iran proving ur failures<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SecPompeo The failing racist #Trump government which hired a lying religious fanatic warmonger like you now have nothing better to do than provoke another criminal regime change in Mid East. You are as you‚Äôve always been a death &amp; destruction machine &amp; a destabilising force<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeftPhoenix @UKLFI @sra_solicitors I thought as much after you got to them. Well done for being ahead. What a bunch of horrible people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To show you how stupid @SecPompeo is &amp; indeed how ignorant #USA admin is here‚Äôs Pompeo tweeting in Iranian to #Iraqi people who speak Arabic not Farsi! These idiots are controlling Mid East fate. No wonder they‚Äôve turned it into a disaster. Nothing worse than dangerous &amp; dumb!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@0Calamity Not surprised! Tories were always going to look after the rich. Love to know the reaction of ex Labour voters who voted for this corrupt gov<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeftPhoenix @UKLFI @sra_solicitors Folks that web page is returning Error 404, which means the site is down. You might want to look into why it‚Äôs down/been taken down?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DCKennard Hear hear &amp; it‚Äôs allowed by all servile Westminster politicians to interfere in our politics at will. Apart from USA I‚Äôve never seen such a supine government as UK, so many of them are bought &amp; sold by foreign lobbies, screwing UK interests in the process!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chrissie_trice1 @SueSuezep @WorkersPartyGB I‚Äôve been saying for a while we need a new party to support for all sorts of reasons that I see the current Labour Party being broken by dubious MP‚Äôs who are now being bought &amp; sold by lobbies. I can also see the next leader even kneeling to Trump &amp; US which is very worrying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If only you &amp; #TonyBlair hadn‚Äôt lied to the entire UK population, a million dead #Iraqis would likely be having post elections talks about hospital waiting times too &amp; talking about some other scum responsible for war crimes!   https://t.co/WckNkGKhSc<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StateDept #USA cares for #Iran just like it did #Iraq : before it illegally invaded it, killed over a million, destroyed its infrastructure &amp; pillaged its resources. Don‚Äôt believe this sudden love, this is typical American war propaganda. US loves power &amp; money, period. Liars<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JZarif It was clear from day one @BorisJohnson @EmmanuelMacron &amp; Merkel were going to be threatened by the rogue assassin &amp; liar @realDonaldTrump : their sudden shift was suspicious &amp; now its clear why. I‚Äôve no doubt they‚Äôll be under more pressure to appease #Trump‚Äôs bully tactics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WaymolWazza Naturally bc too many corrupt senators will back him. What a shame !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCPolitics @afneil Hi @lisanandy you won‚Äôt win leadership by grovelling &amp; your ridiculous remarks re: suspending a member for calling out #Israeli crimes of apartheid, illegal occupation etc just shows how morally devoid you are. Is there any politician left with any morals or backbone ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You got impeached because you‚Äôre a lying corrupt bully &amp; a danger to us all. But don‚Äôt worry @BorisJohnson has your back!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@splootman @Andrew_Adonis @jeremycorbyn As opposed to every other corrupt politician who supported the illegal wars &amp; murders of innocent people &amp; destruction of #Iraq #Libya etc &amp; who still today preach righteousness in Westminster. At least Corbyn had the morality to oppose these genocidal illegal invasions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TonyBlair the murderer of #Iraqis ? Just shows what a hideous death cult you prefer to follow!

<|startoftext|>@AlexTaylorNews Idiots! Utterly embarrassing for the UK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichardBurgon @LauraPidcock Excellent @LauraPidcock is just great good luck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ksadjadpour Your thread stinks of anti Iran propaganda while making US seem the righteous innocent player whereas the opposite is the truth! Utter nonsense. You lot don‚Äôt have a bloody clue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ksadjadpour Triumphant US? How is the murder of 000‚Äôs of Iraqis, destruction of a state &amp; hence vacuum that gave rise to terrorists triumph? Am of Iraqi origin by the way! You forget US invested heavily in sectarianism. Some of us reading your tweets know full facts others might be ignorant!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DCKennard LFI Board of Deputies &amp; JLM etc are PR entities for Israel:there to promote Israel or whitewash its crimes but more crucially interfere in UK politics on behalf of Israel. Together moreover they colluded to destroy Corbyn bc of his support for Palestinian rights. Pure &amp; simple !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CathyKirby65 Thank you Cathy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DogsareLoyal1s You‚Äôre right about that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@poetinpyjama @oakleighRover Of course there‚Äôs public interest why wouldn‚Äôt there be if a senior politician has insider info that was clearly against electoral law then the public has a right to know. No one is above the law<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>5) This is a dangerous turn. Boris will be so desperate for a deal he‚Äôll do anything #Trump asks or possibly face ridiculous sanctions or unfavourable US deals. Brexit will see UK unchain itself from one entity only to be chained to another! So much for freedom, let alone ethics!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4) This is #Trump politics &amp; @BorisJohnson will only be too happy to abide. He has no choice. The tone changed ever since @DominicRaab went to US (summoned there?). The aggressive rhetoric suddenly shifted to that of US! No surprise of course UK has always followed instructions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3) This morning a #USA National Security Advisor made it clear that if UK wants to have a post #Brexit deal with #Trump then it has to align its (anti) #Iran policy with that of US. Notice the pressure: if you want our money then you do as we say! So much the post Brexit freedom!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2) UK having signed an international agreement re: #Iran nuclear deal is now under pressure to break it &amp; go with a #Trump deal. Last night @BorisJohnson said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs go for a Trump deal‚Äù completely disrespecting an agreement that several countries took years to accomplish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1) #BorisJohnson will capitulate to #Trump‚Äôs selfish, authoritarian, erratic &amp; dangerous foreign politics re: #Iran bc he‚Äôs desperate for a post Brexit deal &amp; desperate to prove right the #Tory party‚Äôs campaign slogan right, potentially at any cost it seems<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@larymary60 Wish she had<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JillGore8 Well done Jill. What the board is suggesting is just ridiculous in so many ways. For a start no religious body should interfere in politics nor should they dictate their politically motivated agenda on anyone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flowerchucker If Labour goes downhill I can see a big argument for starting a brand new genuine left party with the loyal followers who‚Äôve felt deflated over the past month<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndiScoLady @jessphillips I can see why. She‚Äôs an untrustworthy opportunist who betrayed her own leader &amp; smeared many mendaciously. Looking at the disgraceful politics in Westminster I can finally understand why Scotland would want independence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Globalidentity You‚Äôve a point. But so did everyone for the simple reason USA &amp; co have lied &amp; lied so much over the past 30 years re: Mid East &amp; waged so many illegal invasions/regime changes it was very easy almost logical to assume yet another lie esp that US has been drumming war for ages<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichardBurgon Wish you best of luck Richard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BoardofDeputies @labourlewis @RichardBurgon @DawnButlerBrent Since when do religious groups interfere in UK politics above other groups &amp; expect to dictate their agenda on #Labour ? Especially if that group (you) acts a a PR lobby for a foreign state? A clear grievous mis-use of antisemitism as a political weapon to interfere in @UKLabour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mc_Heckin_Duff Agree<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stanny03 @DerbyChrisW @georgegalloway Yes I followed briefly. The way Labour is going I see bad signs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenJolly9 Totally &amp; becoming disinterested in this washed down depleted servile version<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DerbyChrisW Can we start a new cleaner Socialist party please? I can see Labour becoming gradually a Blair 2.0. A new party free of chains &amp; corrupt MP‚Äôs will attract many followers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today there was a special session on #Iran in Parliament understandably. The level of US-aligned hostility was similar to that of #Iraq but what was v.shocking was @DominicRaab‚Äôs rhetoric that Iran moved away from Nuclear deal yet not ONCE mentioned @realDonaldTrump breaching it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Similar to the live fire #Israel aimed against the Great March demos in #Gaza where #IDF killed several hundreds innocent #Palestinians incl medics living under apartheid blockade demanding their human rights ? Oh that was self defence!   https://t.co/056xSuXg1m<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimesofIsrael Similar to the live fire #Israel aimed against the Great March in #Gaza where #IDF killed several hundreds innocent #Palestinians incl medics living under apartheid blockade demanding their human rights ? Oh that was self defence!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 So @realDonaldTrump &amp; @SecPompeo lied basically!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Globalidentity I did, in that it was a tragic mistake for which they apologised unlike when USA shot down a civilian Iranian jet in 1988 killed 290 never apologised under Bush who boasted about it &amp; those who shot it were celebrated in US!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AzadiBardya @JZarif @realDonaldTrump Of course am not representative bc am not Iranian! Am Iraqi British &amp; I totally condemn sanctions on Iran &amp; Iranian people because I know the dirty game being played against Iran from experience with Iraq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn Mr.Corbyn ALWAYS on the right side of history<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump &amp; US admin in general can claim anything, anything incl #Iran is about to blow up Big Ben &amp; our UK gov will agree &amp; say ‚Äúyes we‚Äôve seen credible reports of an imminent threat‚Äù!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsreallyalexb @SophiaLamar1 Switch to Russia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#QassemSoleimani‚Äôs assassination had a wider context : #Trump also reportedly listened to GOP senators who wanted him to kill Soleimani in return for their support against impeachment in the senate vote. There‚Äôs always context! @realDonaldTrump #Iran<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markuso09 @SecPompeo Not really but I can hardly keep up with what mayhem we‚Äôre seeing! I‚Äôll look into it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very clever reply by Mark to #Trump who‚Äôs sending ‚Äúlove &amp; support to #Iranians :  Please ignore the fact that I created a travel ban for you and threatened to bomb your cultural sites.  https://t.co/sN9xk9BEqW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HamillHimself Very clever well done<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From an #Iraqi perspective: this notion that #QassemSoleimani has blood of US soldiers on his hand&gt; is this the blood of the US army that invaded #Iraq illegally &amp; murdered over a million people totally destroying Iraq &amp; leading to #ISIS which later Qassem saved Iraq from? #Iran<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump #CIA etc meddling in #Iran politics pushing for regime change in Farsi! Who says Trump was stupid!    https://t.co/AQsK96UrUE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump #Trump #CIA etc meddling in #Iran politics pushing for regime change in Farsi! Who says Trump was stupid!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackDetsch_ALM @AlMonitor Nonsense. #Iraqi PM &amp; Parliament &amp; most people want US out. #Trump threatened PM with sanctions, placing snipers by US embassy to shoot at Iraqis, PM tweeted about it especially when Trump knew Iraq was making a deal w/ #China . Your ‚Äúsources‚Äù are dubious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PebblesLondon @Channel4News Indeed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@muiriey1 @Channel4News Thx Steve. Just fed up of them not being honest. They‚Äôre all so damn weak!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lovemychris I am glad people‚Äôs eyes have been opened. The smear campaign exposed itself &amp; all the liars for their real agenda. At least it‚Äôs all out in the open. Now we just need people to push back &amp; not go back to apathy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lovemychris No one has backbone anymore. The system wants a stream of obedient enslaved politicians. You wait till the new Labour Party starts calling for more wars in Mid East then it‚Äôll become the party the establishment prefers! Nothing will change till people revolutionise<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RamonsSmile Which means it‚Äôs the end of a different party &amp; back to being slaves. Soon he‚Äôll call for war with Iran! What a shame Corbyn was undermined bc we‚Äôre back to corrupt politics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markuso09 No I wouldn‚Äôt call them antisemites at all. The term has been weaponised to smear anyone criticising Israel or advocating Palestinian rights, big difference<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeftPhoenix @jeremycorbyn Ah apologies thought it was Norman<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeftPhoenix @jeremycorbyn He always writes so well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Channel4News Keir needs to explain what the definition of antisemitism is according to dictionary. Bc if he, under pressure from Israel lobby, is saying criticising Israeli crimes are antisemitic then am afraid that won‚Äôt do bc this is/was what this whole fuss is about! Let‚Äôs be clear<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is. But if only int law was upheld from time of #Iraq‚Äôs illegal invasion to destruction of #Libya to US assassination of a top general on foreign sovereign land perhaps everyone would respect the law. But some powerful countries are immune from the law!  https://t.co/tz6I2obMd4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@foreignoffice @DominicRaab @HMATehran It was. So was the assassination of a top general in a foreign country by but int law stops at the border of America &amp; you all justify a case for ‚Äúself defence‚Äù! I am loving the double standards. From the time of Iraq‚Äôs illegal invasion int law got bent!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidjrosenberg Who on earth do they think they are dictating politics to a party !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichardBurgon Well done Richard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnWight1 Excellent article as always John. If only our feeble politicians has as much sense as you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@snarwani Especially that #QassemSoleimani was invited by Iraqi PM to hold talks re: reducing tensions with #Saudi etc. #Trump knew in advance of the proposed talks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mrubeatable Tragically it turned out true! The mayhem of the war tension caused by Trump started all this awful set of events<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatricTheKing @JZarif @realDonaldTrump Don‚Äôt worry #USA made up for it by murdering millions in #Iraq Mid East &amp; now starving the Iranian people. Not to mention US shot down a civilian Iranian jet in 1988 killing 290 people 66 of which were children. We all know what a big terrorist USA is! Do some research<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SanaSaeed A clear illegal occupation of #Iraq by #USA against the will of its people &amp; government &amp; evidence that US doesn‚Äôt respect sovereignty &amp; is there to occupy, control &amp; pillage resources !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@c3t1p99 @JZarif Time for the biggest int terrorists USA to leave Iraq. It‚Äôs had nothing but death &amp; destruction as a result of their vile foreign policy designed to destroy &amp; pillage the Mid East.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frangenever I know me too, the timing, anti Iran propaganda, past lies et etc made me doubt it very much. Very sad for the dead. Tragically war &amp; war tensions bring about the most awful results. I still believe none of this would happen without the aggressive pretext! Tragedy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkHeert  https://t.co/l4WGeyTkx9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkHeert Are you sure?!!  https://t.co/JKHRgCC76v<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A tragic error by Iran. Glad they admitted failure &amp; regret unlike when US shot down an Iranian civilian jet killing 290 where Bush never apologised &amp; where those who shot it were later celebrated back in US!

<|startoftext|>@johnpilger Always one of the best Mr. Pilger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seancass63 I have my suspicions too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IbnRiad And that‚Äôs part of the overall American hysteria. US knows that Iran has sophisticated military technology it even delivered very precise missile hits against its base in Iraq. So the suggestion that a ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù made missile hit a jet serves a wider deflective propaganda<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AJEnglish So a re-run of the unlawful occupation of #Iraq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdEddieknowles2 @AWAKEALERT Exactly hence why they tried to sanction Turkey for buying them. Now Iraq wants to buy them too, another reason for the panic around their expulsion from the country<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AWAKEALERT Exactly why US are so afraid of Russian S 300 &amp; 400 systems<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you want to hear real investigative journalism from the ground in Mid East follow @VanessaBeeley who‚Äôs got more experience &amp; knowledge than the usual rubbish brainwash western MSM state propaganda. #Iran #Iraq #Syria<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevemakastevem @AliVelshi Yes a typo obviously. I think Sky quickly deleted it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevemakastevem @AliVelshi A logical scenario yes. In times of war there could be lots of chaos<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonJuan603 True but then who started all this instability &amp; mayhem if it weren‚Äôt for the US assassination on a foreign sovereign land<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@garethicke @PopDad5 @michaeldecon @SkyNews They‚Äôve done if before. The Q we always need to ask is who benefits! Certainly not Iran unless it was a huge mistake<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABelvin Obviously a typo albeit seeming a Freudian slip! It would be suicidal of Sky news. Maybe that‚Äôs why can‚Äôt find tweet must‚Äôve been deleted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevemakastevem @AliVelshi In the event missiles were fired why so near the airport? &amp; was it in anticipation of a counter attack? The logic of it all is missing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABelvin Go for it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@julesm2014 @Channel4News We‚Äôve no hope for change so long as people keep voting in the same corrupt feeble lot. That was a main reason I wanted Corbyn to win at least his foreign policy would‚Äôve been pacifist. We‚Äôve no real politicians just obedient administrators<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABelvin Please thank you. Just a little cautious over photoshopped material<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevemakastevem @AliVelshi It took approximately an hour or so according to reports. I think it was over shortly after 2.40am-ish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonJuan603 Sounds like everything the west has done throughout the last 3 decades of their destruction of Mid East!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AgainstHunting Me neither. He‚Äôs a useless yes sir &amp; like predecessors will follow anything US says to him. No backbone just an opportunist liar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@julesm2014 @Channel4News I am sick of it. I could close my eyes &amp; ears and guess exactly what they‚Äôll say. It‚Äôs sickening how they work like clock work following one script<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevemakastevem Thank you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevemakastevem Yes I over quoted the time by 20 minutes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABelvin Really? Sky news said American missile? Do you have the actually tweet? I just went through Sky can‚Äôt find it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevemakastevem @AliVelshi I am trying to figure things out. Still reading lots around it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HiwattPete @CNN Possibly from Fox News<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>. @JustinTrudeau says ‚ÄúWorld leaders‚Äù suspect #Iran shot down #Ukrainian jet. Which WORLD leaders? There were 3 of them, the usual leaders who give you ample propaganda &amp; intel sources you‚Äôll just have to believe before they go to war! #IranPlaneCrash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aka #Iran was fully compliant with nuclear deal &amp; its actions the most verifiable. Never believe #USA lies that Iran is a rogue state that breaches<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Under the debris of anti #Iran propaganda &amp; war rhetoric you wouldn‚Äôt know that #QassemSoleimani helped #USA w/its fight against #Taliban 2) saved Baghdad from fall to #ISIS 3) worked w/ US forces to destroy ISIS! MSM too invested to convince people that he was just a ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The democratic will of the #Iraqi people &amp; parliament has been rejected by @realDonaldTrump &amp; @SecPompeo : #USA was invited to be in Iraq, now being asked to leave but refuses to. Oil interests &amp; regional hegemony overtake democracy! #Iran<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3) must be mentioned here that the same ‚Äúcooperative‚Äù @bellingcat that was used to provide ‚Äúreliable independent evidence‚Äù on #Syria hence justifying bombing etc is now being used over anti #Iran rhetoric. Curious how secret services don‚Äôt have the intel Bellingcat does!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1) Note the implication here (without concrete evidence nor even its beginning) of the usual pro war-megaphone @CNN saying ‚Äú #Ukrainian plane shot by #Iran using #Russian missiles‚Äù: how many birds were hit with one blame-stone! Why make all these claims w/out final findings?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iammilad3 There must be lots of Iraqi eye witnesses who saw something, surely ! Am waiting for some whistleblowers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ROYA56646187 They will try every dirty trick to demonise Iran. This is what they did to Iraq Libya etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iammilad3 What puzzles me is how can such damage &amp; casualties not be seen or leaked by anyone!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnahitaAredvi @leelizard4 Indeed yes thank you. Just makes no sense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iammilad3 Am trying to find out what happened on that base<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aunnhvhs Me too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aliraaxdd @sayyedkhandan Or shot down by a 3rd party to make Iran look like the bad one ! It is a dirty game after all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aliraaxdd @sayyedkhandan Military would‚Äôve been prepared for military jets as opposed to huge civilian jets! Let‚Äôs wait for final results<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeftPhoenix I have my suspicions. Trump looked nervous the next day &amp; suddenly all the usual suspect allies like Canada which 2 days ago had no intel now suddenly have credible intel! Stinks of suspicion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FriedemannWo Ah yes sorry. The invitation news I heard on TV, Russia Today. As for the timings of flights &amp; missies they are well documented in many news articles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sayyedkhandan Exactly! Just makes no sense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamuelStolton @StevenErlanger Notice also how suddenly Bellingcat, NATO‚Äôs favourite regime change experts, are suddenly providing evidence no one had!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FriedemannWo What‚Äôs SRC?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nooyoowk @stevemakastevem Remember the 5 Eyes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DerbyChrisW Me please<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevemakastevem @AWAKEALERT @wisermann @SDGMasterglass @Marwa__Osman Yes I also tweeted about it. He also said how Trump threatened to station snipers &amp; shoot Iraqis demonstrating outside the US in the even Iraq signs a deal with China! Mafia style politics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lambergino @CathyKirby65 Thank you. There are many ordinary people asking the same questions &amp; seeking the truth. We can‚Äôt trust politicians anymore so we need to research &amp; use our own logic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yasthetwit @drippinmayo Thx I read 2 different reports but happy to be corrected<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevemakastevem @AWAKEALERT Am following them too &amp; I‚Äôve trusted their info before. Trump‚Äôs next morning speech sounded nervous! Am looking into it. Such casualties can‚Äôt be hidden for too long! Need to research more info it. We‚Äôre being kept in the dark for sure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@palevant Thank you, likewise<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@palevant I never ever fall for it. From day one I saw the lies. I lived through the Iraq war lies. I have a history in all this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevemakastevem It‚Äôs left to the ordinary people to debunk their lies mate. You‚Äôre in?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So severe &amp; sinister was the program of regime change in #Syria that #Bellingcat &amp; it‚Äôs main head #EliotHiggins went out of their way to whitewash terrorists as ‚Äúmoderate rebels‚Äù.

<|startoftext|>#NATO related entities invested in regime change program in #Syria wanted to look like it was getting ‚Äúindependent source‚Äù investigative analysis funded #Bellingcat &amp; quoted them as ‚Äúreliable source‚Äù for all sorts of propaganda stories that fit its narratives over Syria.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#EliotHiggins of #Bellingcat : man funded by #NATO to push pro #Syria regime-change narrative, whose chemical attack narrative was debunked thru leaked #OPCW memos is now being used by @BBCNews @Channel4News on anti #Iran narrative.

<|startoftext|>@Cammo_Eckert__ Iran Sweden Ukraine &amp; Canada are investigating so let‚Äôs wait for final results<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cammo_Eckert__ Refused to give it to Boeing: an American company which due to sanctions isn‚Äôt allowed to deal with Iran except by special export license. &amp; why should Iran trust America which is so intent on destroying it using all sorts of lies! Would you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CathyKirby65 Then we‚Äôll have a discussion over it? For years I‚Äôve watched propaganda against Iraq, Libya, Syria, Russia &amp; any other country the US names as enemy &amp; saw a consistent pattern of lies, propaganda &amp; behaviour. Like clock work. Even the Ukrainian revolution was  manufactured by CIA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CathyKirby65 Me too. I‚Äôve seen so many events that make absolutely no sense but only serve the agendas of those normally waging wars/propaganda etc that I never believe them. I ask, who benefits! Certainly not Iran. It‚Äôd be ludicrous to think so. I‚Äôll wait for further concrete evidence tho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Iran has invited all countries who had nationals on the Ukrainian plane to send their investigative teams to investigate the crash site. Does that sound like a country which shot a plane! #IranPlaneCrash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The missiles were fired at 1:45 a.m while the airplane crashed at 6:12a.m.  so we‚Äôre meant to believe abt 5 hours later #Iran got their intel so badly they shot a civilian flight with many Iranians on board? Utterly ridiculous. Iran has sophisticated radars. #IranPlaneCrash<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Iraq moving away from relying on #USA for defence systems &amp; who can blame it, it‚Äôs been held captive in its own country for 30 years. More regional countries diversify towards #Russia &amp; #China. No doubt #Trump will announce sanctions soon !<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@stevemakastevem @Channel4News They couldn‚Äôt be more obviously biased even if they tried. Interesting recent #OPCW leaks debunked #Syria chemical attacks in April 2018, a story so fiercely disseminated by Bellingcat. Love how their main speaker Higgins was a woman‚Äôs lingerie salesman now expert! It‚Äôs a joke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MR0130921080 @Channel4News Ditto<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moreover #USA has already started pushing narrative w/out evidence that #Iran fired #Russian missile etc, thereby hitting against 2 perceived enemies in one go. Remember MH17? Why not wait for Ukraine Sweden &amp; Canada to work w/ Iran to gather full evidence before blaming! Dubious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What‚Äôs also increasing my suspicion re: #IranPlaneCrash is 1) evidence only by Washington/CNN 2) hosting the usual suspects like #Bellingcat who‚Äôve acted as NATO stenographers for regime change/whitewashing terrorists as ‚Äúmoderate rebels‚Äù in #Syria<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Melishere55 @SkyNews Thx for the concern but not commenting in dark just looking at the bigger picture. It‚Äôs perspective!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am sensing a blame game against #Iran for #IranPlaneCrash : watching @Channel4News now hosting someone from #Bellingcat (the NATO funded entity to support #Syria regime change) has increased my suspicion.

<|startoftext|>@TerrinaMajnoona I agree. I sense a deliberate blame game against #Iran<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@VviewSsonicMair @SkyNews Agreed. Sadly NATO leaders &amp; their servile MSM &amp; related entities are not invested in critical analysis/truth for fear of reprisals.

<|startoftext|>Good to see finally MSM like @SkyNews point out the crucial role #QassemSoleimani played in destroying #ISIS in #Iraq #Syria etc. With all the expected anti #Iran (I.e pro NATO) rhetoric this vital truth was masked while making a case for US‚Äôs illegal assassination !<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>A lesson next time you see humanitarian ‚Äúactivists‚Äù speaking against the ‚Äúbogey regime‚Äù on MSM, they usually turn out to be funded by the aggressor ( #USA ) against the target country ( #Iran ). We had this pantomime over #Syria #Iraq #Libya etc<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>. @SecPompeo &amp; @realDonaldTrump are spewing non-stop lies to justify their terrorist act so it‚Äôs natural they‚Äôd break Int Conventions to prevent #Iran from presenting its side of they story. #Trump‚Äôs cult want a blackout of the truth &amp; constant brainwash   https://t.co/WC7L1I27uE<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@iraq_mawtini @CarlaSpade @AFP Every country becomes corrupt after war where there is a power vacuum, it‚Äôs happened everywhere throughout the world but more so in Iraq because it‚Äôs a rich country<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iraq_mawtini @CarlaSpade @AFP The iraqi people have that responsibility not anyone else but if a country becomes lawless as it did under US rule then corruption spreads. America deliberately brought in corrupt people &amp; encouraged sectarianism to  more easily control Iraq &amp; destabilis it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iraq_mawtini @AFP Absolutely both. It has proven so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_SJPeace_ Very very well said, kudos to these guys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dbond9 @jessphillips Nice one Dave, a troll with no tweets :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarlaSpade @iraq_mawtini @AFP Exactly. Many people prefer Russia. In fact Russia has been very clever in shifting regional geopolitics. Suffice to say Russia &amp; Iran were the first &amp; fiercest forces against jihadi terrorists while NATO did nothing but encourage them in fact. Let‚Äôs be clear here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iraq_mawtini @AFP US is no longer the only superpower. Russia &amp; China are increasingly taking over. Let me remind you when USSR had influence over Mid East we never had so much death &amp; destruction. Once Arab countries move towards these 2 powers things will shift. I firmly believe it‚Äôll be safer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iraq_mawtini @AFP Nothing can be worse than an illegal occupation by a foreign power that destroyed the country in the first place &amp; pillaged its resources. So long as US stays there‚Äôll be mayhem<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lauraqwriter @MichaelRosenYes @CathyKirby65 Yes we‚Äôve heard about that. Also certain people (unknown who yet) have fired light missiles on US embassy. It‚Äôll get worse.

<|startoftext|>@CathyKirby65 @TonyLyons66 @MichaelRosenYes I could go on for hours. Am originally from Iraq so have seen this scenario over &amp; over; the lies, war rhetoric, oil interests.

<|startoftext|>@CathyKirby65 @TonyLyons66 @MichaelRosenYes Cathy, every UK leader has been subservient to US politics for many reasons but mainly political pressure, blackmail (e.g trade).

<|startoftext|>@TonyLyons66 @MichaelRosenYes @CathyKirby65 He won‚Äôt fight nor will any rich/politician/VIP/or sudden Mid East experts who come on TV pretending to know it all when yesterday they had no idea who #QassemSoleimani was.

<|startoftext|>@TonyLyons66 @MichaelRosenYes @CathyKirby65 It was a heinous crime against every law. Imagine if Iran has bombed a US top general in say Canada!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarrellChaloner @MichaelRosenYes @CathyKirby65 Indeed. The prospect of having a strong regional very rich powerful country unwilling to bow to US &amp; working to strengthen ties with Asia etc scares US, it always has. Saudi is a terror funding state but gets away w/murder bc it‚Äôs an ‚Äúobedient‚Äù kingdom! That‚Äôs how it works<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TonyLyons66 @MichaelRosenYes @CathyKirby65 In addition they‚Äôre stopping all military co-op with US re fighting terror &amp; will submit an official complaint to UN re: assassination.

<|startoftext|>@TonyLyons66 @MichaelRosenYes @CathyKirby65 The Iraqi gov is furious. The entire parliament was outraged at the US violations within its territory.

<|startoftext|>@MichaelRosenYes @CathyKirby65 Yes Michael. I was watching Iraqi TV &amp; Parliament session.

<|startoftext|>@Tunnelbreeze @foreignoffice @DominicRaab @BorisJohnson Well he‚Äôs living lavishly in south of France &amp; gets paid multiple 000‚Äôs¬£ per ‚Äúspeech‚Äù so mission accomplished, screw the public as far as he‚Äôs concerned<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tunnelbreeze @JohnWight1 @foreignoffice I suspect you won‚Äôt get a favourable answer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tunnelbreeze @foreignoffice @DominicRaab @BorisJohnson We are in the process of doing that now üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tunnelbreeze @foreignoffice @DominicRaab @BorisJohnson Agree. Am not much younger Simon I know what you mean<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tunnelbreeze @foreignoffice @DominicRaab @BorisJohnson I need to look into it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tunnelbreeze @foreignoffice @DominicRaab @BorisJohnson True. I see signs everywhere people subscribing to alternative media etc. Interesting how Facebook is panicking over TikTok as a rival!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JZarif Hear hear well said Mr. Zarif. The era of the Wild West cowboys may have passed but the culture is still very much there in Washington!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kill kill kill. Once a cowboy mentality always a cowboy mentality. The murderous empire knows only death! #Trump #Iran #Iraq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Once a cowboy mentality always a cowboy mentality!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tunnelbreeze @foreignoffice @DominicRaab @BorisJohnson I agree. As a journalist and evidently you‚Äôre quite well read on politics what do you suggest needs to happen to break away from this control? I recognise social media has been a great help in providing real alternative which is why govs etc panic at its influence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tunnelbreeze @foreignoffice @DominicRaab @BorisJohnson Easier to control the masses &amp; hence US interests through dictators you bring &amp; destroy at will. Also resources like oil etc will be easier to manipulate: price, production &amp; a weapon of silent war<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tunnelbreeze @foreignoffice @DominicRaab @BorisJohnson &amp; I fear worse is yet to come !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tunnelbreeze @foreignoffice @DominicRaab @BorisJohnson Well remember when they had a democratically elected leader who was toppled by CIA? US has always meddled in Mid East to destabilise but I agree leaders should play better locally<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tunnelbreeze @foreignoffice @DominicRaab @BorisJohnson I agree. You don‚Äôt just go round murdering &amp; destroying without blow back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BJohnb181 @Tunnelbreeze @foreignoffice @DominicRaab @BorisJohnson We need a drastic change in our core domestic &amp; foreign politics. I just don‚Äôt see it happening bc the old guard have taken such a strong hold on things<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tunnelbreeze @foreignoffice @DominicRaab @BorisJohnson Agreed fully. What really annoys me is the ordinary British public are generally nothing like our gov/MSM. They‚Äôre against all such wars &amp; interventions. The divide is unreal yet somehow we can‚Äôt get decent independent gov in power! Politicians have 2 faces: foreign vs domestic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@onebritishguy @jeremycorbyn @BettyTomsdottir That‚Äôs just facade rhetoric. In actual fact UK will do as instructed by US, as it‚Äôs done before. We have no independence of action &amp; policy. History confirms it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tunnelbreeze @foreignoffice @DominicRaab @BorisJohnson Many countries will be affected. Economies will be deeply hit. It‚Äôs a disaster in the making. Iraq will pale by comparison. Iran isn‚Äôt a walkover &amp; has China &amp; Russia on its side too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tunnelbreeze @foreignoffice @DominicRaab @BorisJohnson If anything Brexit will enslave UK even more now that it needs trade deals. They won‚Äôt dare speak up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@julesm2014 @DominicRaab @BorisJohnson Already UK position has shifted from ‚Äúcalm down‚Äù to ‚ÄúIran is a murderous regime‚Äù reminiscent of Iraq Libya catastrophes.

<|startoftext|>@markuso09 @trevorw1953 Of course. Dead bodies for them is extra cash &amp; that‚Äôs all they care about<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tunnelbreeze @foreignoffice @DominicRaab @BorisJohnson Indeed so was Blair re: Iraq &amp; Cameron re: Libya! We have no independent policy unless of course UK politics is ideologically intertwined with US which seems to be the case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MohamadAhwaze RIP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GlennBair @HalaJaber Well said<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tunnelbreeze @foreignoffice @DominicRaab @BorisJohnson And as crucially by our own feeble governments too afraid to take an independent stance away from destructive US foreign policies! Nothing changes except the faces<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@SkyNews last night had a ridiculous woman commenting on America‚Äôs illegal assassination &amp; violation of #Iraq sovereignty. Her words ‚Äúwell we are where we are &amp; Iran is a terror regime! No brain, no analysis just #Trump rhetoric. MSM deliberately host US-subservient warmongers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jimmy_dore Well done folks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #Iraq parliament votes for US forces to leave but America refuses then it‚Äôll essentially be an illegal occupation &amp; back to old days. No doubt US will do anything to stay in Iraq even if it means killing or creating false flags. They‚Äôve done it before. It‚Äôs an aggressor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>UK is essentially a vassal state to USA. Don‚Äôt expect subservient leaders like Boris to condemn this illegal assassination on sovereign #Iraq . Boris will follow #Trump instructions even if it means our doom,he needs their money. For decades we‚Äôve had ‚ÄúYes Sir‚Äù feeble politicians<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn @BettyTomsdottir Boris as other subservient leaders like war criminal Blair #Iraq &amp; Cameron #Libya will follow US instructions even if it means going to war. UK is sadly a vassal state. Already we have figures on TV regurgitating ‚ÄúIran is terrorist‚Äù reminiscent of Iraq disaster. Boris needs deals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelRosenYes @BettyTomsdottir Neither Boris/gov have the audacity to condemn this illegal assassination on sovereign land. UK gov is feeble. At best they say calm down then slowly repeat US aggressive talk. They‚Äôve always been subservient. Remember Iraq lies. Boris needs a deal w/US so will comply head bowed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DilysDavies @SecPompeo @IsraeliPM @netanyahu Thank you. He really did an amazing job but of course US disliked anyone who did &amp; now slowly the same anti Mid East warmongers are repeating lies Iran is a terror stare just like they did with Iraq. Nothing has changed with these racist warmongers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vanbadham @logansteven We in the UK fear Boris Johnson will do the same<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alhazzani_Amal @JZarif Says the Saudi:) don‚Äôt you have that local butcher MBS to deal with. The stench of #Yemen genocide lingers everywhere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JZarif We said Mr. Zarif the Mid East has had enough American death &amp; destruction. Nothing but evil has come out of them &amp; their crimes. Time for people to rise up against US once &amp; for all they need to leave Iraq ASAP. No one wants them there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthewBadass2 @TheMendozaWoman Indeed I agree<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mcnallydb I agree. Those MP‚Äôs who spread lies &amp; smears like those pictures did a ghastly job of spreading hate &amp; division<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CloseLundy @TheMendozaWoman Your intellect seems limited to a few words you‚Äôve learned like Trots &amp; Stalinist!

<|startoftext|>#Iraq didn‚Äôt beg you to stay.

<|startoftext|>After a million dead in #Iraq through the illegal invasion using lies &amp; propaganda &amp; total destruction of Libya &amp; Syria I now know why Ian Austin wanted people not to vote for the anti-war #JeremyCorbyn : He‚Äôs in favour of more death &amp; destruction! #Iran  https://t.co/Zb19RuAjSC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who would‚Äôve thought Ian Austin was in favour of more wars that kill more Arabs &amp; Muslims, support regime changes, destabilise the region &amp; produce more terrorism &amp; the inevitable blow back!

<|startoftext|>People in #USA aren‚Äôt as outraged that their country has murdered millions of Arabs &amp; totally destroyed many Mid East countries through lies, illegal invasions, occupation &amp; pillage of their resources. They‚Äôve been sold the ‚ÄúAmerica is great‚Äù Story for far too long!  No clue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DerbyChrisW @citizentommy Our gov &amp; MSM are nothing but servants of American warmongering especially when it comes to killing Arabs &amp; Muslims &amp; general destruction of Mid East while preaching righteousness to the masses<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirvani_rose @Jc4Bin @katedodd3 @jessphillips Just mute &amp; ignore Rose. Honestly you‚Äôre wasting your time on these zombies<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sharkdiveruk @shirvani_rose @Jc4Bin @katedodd3 @jessphillips In 1948 Israel ethnically cleansed 700k #Palestinians &amp; has since then been illegally occupying them, stealing their land &amp; inflicted the most racist set of apartheid policies. You don‚Äôt establish a state by cleansing indigenous people. What a pathetic tweet &amp; denial<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did Andrew support #Iraq war? Was he one of those who sold us lies that killed millions of Arabs ?

<|startoftext|>&amp; it goes without saying that America‚Äôs 2nd ally #Saudi fully funded &amp; exported terrorists to #Syria incl #alqaeda #alnusra etc. #USA surrounds itself with allies who support arm &amp; fund jihadi terrorists who‚Äôve for long called for war w/ #Iran while playing the war on terror lie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@georgegalloway You were always right George about the wars in Mid East. In fact too right for a Labour gov &amp; indeed a political establishment so corrupt they hounded you for precisely exposing their corruption &amp; the crimes they were supporting. Nothing will save humanity but radical change<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Beyond_Contempt @LauraMStuart9 Good move<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#USA can invade, kill &amp; destroy at will using lies &amp; deceit. Anyone it doesn‚Äôt like it calls ‚Äúterrorist‚Äù to justify its own version of international terrorism. The uni-polar world must end if we‚Äôre to see an end to this death &amp; destruction cycle. #Iraq #Iran must ally w/others<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It‚Äôs not surprising that servile #Tory politicians like #JeremyHunt come out in support of an illegal assassination by #USA violating int law in Iraq.

<|startoftext|>@BDraig @mrmmdepoer Well said<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imsitservian @damian_from @Daltry @BorisJohnson Ah! Ok thx for clarifying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brtanner Exactly. Expect more of their media assets disseminating war propaganda. Already that gutter Daily Mail headlining ‚ÄúBritain braces itself for Iranian revenge‚Äù! Getting the naive public ready for war based on lies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shirvani_rose @Jc4Bin @katedodd3 @jessphillips Ignore them. They always bring in the Jewish aspect so they can use their antisemitism in desperation bc they‚Äôve nothing else to qualify they‚Äôd ridiculous rhetoric, losers.

<|startoftext|>@Jc4Bin @katedodd3 @shirvani_rose @jessphillips Is Jess a Jew? No.. so take your propaganda &amp; go away. Nice try<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LieBusterSleuth @LibertyBlitz I always tweeted it‚Äôs not possible to commit suicide in an empty cell. I had no idea about cremation but yes that‚Äôs a ridiculous thing to say as you say Jews don‚Äôt cremate. Someone will spot him in person surely one day unless they change his face! You have a link pls?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LieBusterSleuth @LibertyBlitz Am with you on the exposure I just thought they‚Äôd cancel him as he was a liability. But obviously he has grateful friends. The dirt of that mafia ! Isn‚Äôt there one damn brave whistleblower?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LieBusterSleuth @LibertyBlitz I never thought about that! They smuggled him out. Of course no one saw him out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To prove how desperate the US Administration is: here‚Äôs VP Mike Pence making up a lie that #QassemSuleimani had a hand in 9/11 presumably to sell their illegal assassination to their naive public.

<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump When you knock on someone‚Äôs door, kill them then say ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean a fight‚Äù you invite a fight back.

<|startoftext|>@Sassoon_Eli I can‚Äôt but I can see you part of the mendacious &amp; pathetic smear campaign. Nice try though Sassoon:) try another one mate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sassoon_Eli When you have so many hounds working against you incl MSM, secret service, establishment, your own Party members working for Israeli interests, military complex etc etc it‚Äôs a miracle he got over 10 million votes, don‚Äôt you think mr sassoon?

<|startoftext|>@damian_from @Daltry @BorisJohnson Interesting that Pompeo briefed Raab yet Boris said he wasn‚Äôt briefed!  https://t.co/SA8onihibO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donilo252525 And there will be more, trust me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn Well done Mr. Corbyn, only you have the morals to do so. Such a shame you‚Äôre not our PM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson You said you weren‚Äôt briefed on the American assassination of #QassimSoleimani but @DominicRaab was! Didn‚Äôt he tell you as your foreign sec? Who is not telling the truth?   https://t.co/SA8onihibO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@foreignoffice @DominicRaab Hi @DominicRaab did Pompeo brief you about the assassination of #QassemSoleiman ? If so why didn‚Äôt you say so? It was an illegal act of aggression. &amp; why is @BorisJohnson saying he wasn‚Äôt briefed? Didn‚Äôt you tell him? Who is lying here?  https://t.co/SA8onihibO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hang on! @BorisJohnson said he wasn‚Äôt briefed about #QassimSolimani assassination yet @DominicRaab was? &amp; Dominic pretends he found out later calling for calm! Is this why he refused interview with @Channel4News ? Who‚Äôs lying or both are? Why is our gov always so weak! #Iran<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lloyd_rm @Finkley1 @DominicRaab @BorisJohnson said he wasn‚Äôt briefed about #QassemSulaimani ! So how come @DominicRaab was?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>5) so you see Jess it‚Äôs hard for people to trust someone like you with a tainted disingenuous past. People don‚Äôt change much as they like to pretend just to win votes! The era of fake politics really must end<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4) @jessphillips why were you willing to support @theresa_may in bombing #Syria illegally when May‚Äôs justification was based on social media stories by groups affiliated to jihadis? Did Iraq teach you nothing? Recent #OPCW leaks completely debunk the chemical attacks story<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3) Corbyn was so popular with many, was a man for peace &amp; social justice &amp; he was willing to respect the Brexit referendum but you lot stopped him knowing well Brexiteers would turn against him. You flirted with Tories, defectors, basically anyone anti Corbyn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2) at every opportunity you back-stabbed @jeremycorbyn while he was facing the most dirty mendacious campaign any politician has faced in the UK, not once did you have the conscience or integrity to defend a very decent man. Instead you sided with vindictive MP‚Äôs #jessphillips<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donilo252525 @kovichni Hear hear<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanduffy_ Every murderous war the US has led against Mid East has been based on lies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is @SkyNews bringing in ‚Äúspecialists‚Äù who seem to only specialise in whitewashing America‚Äôs latest murder &amp; sovereignty aggression in #Iraq rather than hold it accountable to the crime it just committed? Why does our MSM specialise in numbing the shock of what just happened?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Truly hope the UK doesn‚Äôt act like the usual weak supine tail-end of America when it comes to #Iran &amp; gets dragged again into American illegal wars &amp; aggression. The public must ensure our gov doesn‚Äôt join US international terrorism. #QassemSoleimani<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RLong_Bailey Well said. Good you called it assassination too. Just hope UK doesn‚Äôt act like the weak supine feeble tail-end of America, again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donilo252525 @kovichni He‚Äôs a hero in Israel!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>10) the whole region is at stake now, world economies will suffer &amp; many will die as a result. Every sovereign country has a right to self defence so no one should be surprised to see retaliation by #Iran : after all what would any other country do? #QassemSoleimani<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>9) #Iran has superpower allies in #China &amp; #Russia along with many regional factions. Mike Pompeo is an idiot if he thinks he can murder at will then hope Iran will de-escalate the situation. This isn‚Äôt just arrogance but utter stupidity &amp; amateur dangerous politics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>8) #Iran isn‚Äôt a walkover nor will its people revolt as US hopes. If anything they‚Äôll see this as American aggression against ‚Äúits house‚Äù &amp; likely strengthen their unity. The murder of #QassemSuleimani is that step too far &amp; Iraqis won‚Äôt forgive the murder of its people either<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>7) pre #Iraq #Libya destruction USA used similar lies ‚ÄúLibya was about to commit massacre, Iraq had WMD etc‚Äù. Now they say Iran killed millions to justify what really amounts to US international terrorism! The MSM will regurgitate w/out question &amp; servile politicians follow suite<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>6) when running for election @realDonaldTrump praised #Iran for fighting #ISIS : few months into entering the crime-house that is the WhiteHouse &amp; his rhetoric turns 180 degrees! Now he claims Iran killed 00‚Äôs of Americans without any proof! All lies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>5) #Saudi is another country which has been pushing for war with #Iran : notice how the genocide of #Yemen has been enabled &amp; supported by both UK &amp; USA w/out question.  #Iran stood as an obstacle to Saudi in terms of influence &amp; control of the region<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4) more dangerously US takes advice &amp; instruction from #Israel which had been at the forefront of drumming war with #Iran &amp; has done everything to put obstacles in any normalisation of relations with Iran. #Trump admitted he takes Mid East advice from Netanyahu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3) the fact of the matter is US doesn‚Äôt like any regional power in Mid East to question its hegemonic policies &amp; that‚Äôs another reason we see ridiculous rhetoric like ‚ÄúIran killed millions or exports terror‚Äù. US has murdered more people in Mid East than any other power<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2) as soon as #Iran entered the arena in #Syria &amp; starting fighting the terrorists inside it, US as well as allies like #Israel &amp; #Saudi took a more aggressive stance towards it. US also wasn‚Äôt happy losing control of #Iraq to Iran after it had brought Iraq to its knees<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1) the assassination of #QassemSoleimani &amp; #Iraqi military personnel wasn‚Äôt just premeditated murder on sovereign land but a deliberate provocation for war. #Iran has been a thorn for US hegemony in Mid East interrupting things like total collapse of #Syria thru jihadis terror<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The planned assassination of #QassimSolimani &amp; #Iraqi commander by USA &amp; ( &amp; #Israel no doubt) will unleash hell &amp; guaranteed revenge &amp; retaliation. #Trump under Saudi/Israeli/hawk advice will plunge the region into a bloodbath while underestimating #Iran‚Äôs resolve. Huge mistake<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Imamofpeace Imam of fake US propaganda !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Both #Iraq &amp; #Iran‚Äôs military commanders have just been murdered by American forces. Iraq‚Äôs sovereignty has been violated by US. Both counties have absolute legal right to retaliate against #USA army &amp; I truly hope they do. This sort of Int terrorism must stop! #QassemSoleimani<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@carbonlogix @DerbyChrisW @tonygreenstein1 Because supporters of apartheid Israel did a big dirty campaign to destroy him purely bc he supports Palestinian rights so all the apartheid supporters got together &amp; made up a big fat lie campaign to have an investigation by dubious entities like EHRC which will all prove fake<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DerbyChrisW @tonygreenstein1 Absolutely spot on. The antisemitism smear campaigners had an objective which was to smear so much that everyone had to capitulate &amp; apologise for something that was fake &amp; politically manufactured to undermine Corbyn just bc he supports Palestinian human rights<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MichaelRosenYes @LordJohnMann Cc @LordJohnMann done<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CorbynistaTeen Hope you had a good Xmas mate. Gertrude has few too many fermented mince pies, must‚Äôve gotten to her head mate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Israel‚Äôs Apartheid Trade Envoy: this is what the job has done to this loser, he‚Äôs become a hateful troll!  https://t.co/doAvropYz9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanAustin1965 #Israel‚Äôs trade envoy. Working for an apartheid state has made you rotten<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeftPhoenix @TwitterSupport @TwitterSafety @jack @jc4P45 @GnasherJew These people are dangerous. Hope the police is informed too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenjaminNorton Thanks Ben. It really is terrifying this vile rise of fascism. Not only an Islamophobe but interesting how if Modi praised Hitler that Netanyahu regards him as a close friend!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ToryFibs Simply @jeremycorbyn was way too good for our corrupt broken lobby-engineered politicians &amp; politics &amp; propaganda-tool MSM. He‚Äôs the best PM we never had. But his legacy will live on for generations, unlike majority of others who‚Äôll likely be disliked for what they didn‚Äôt achieve<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All that‚Äôs needed now is to find the main pimp #GhislaineMaxwell so she can be forced to tell us all about this extent of the child trafficking crimes &amp; how many more VIP‚Äôs weee involved. Unless of course she ‚Äúcommits suicide‚Äù !   https://t.co/OHR33khpER<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mitchmusic @cutter78 @MichaelRosenYes @IanAustin1965 @LordJohnMann You‚Äôre not wrong there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelRosenYes @IanAustin1965 @LordJohnMann Unbelievable he blocked you but I can only suspect your exposure of his hypocrisy &amp; double standard (focusing on AS just in labour while ignoring all else) was just too much for his facade! All in all Michael well done, you win he loses big time. His reputation is tarnished<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IsraeliPM You stopped Christian #Palestinians in #Gaza from visiting Bethlehem, on their most holy day bc you‚Äôre a racist xenophobe. You surround other Christians illegally within West Bank. Your words are hollow &amp; your policies of apartheid are against every heavenly religion. Criminal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beholdcosmicwav BBC have always been influenced by old guard, establishment figures, lobby pressure etc. They courted Tory party &amp; co bc that‚Äôs where the pressure was coming from besides they wanted to side with the seemingly stronger side<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I sincerely hope #BBC is scared. Years of bias, propaganda &amp; misinfo along with their vile anti #JeremyCorbyn rhetoric during last election have ruined their reputation. People won‚Äôt forget<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IDF Perhaps if #Israel was a civilised entity not immersed in crimes of apartheid, illegal occupation of #Palestinian land &amp; ethnically cleansing its people while stealing their land you wouldn‚Äôt be saying this. You have a deep sense of guilt bc of the crimes you‚Äôve all committed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chacohparis @M_AndersonSF @Kay7To @sinnfeinireland @DerrySinnFein @nadplo @USPalAffairs @CMcGin2006 @EmmaMcGinley_x @PalestineCenter @ICC Including all the racist Israelis &amp; their followers who have committed massacres, occupied #Palestinian land illegally, enforced vile apartheid &amp; ethnically cleansed indigenous Palestinians &amp; hopefully demented psychos like you who support these crimes against humanity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnmcdonnellMP To you too John &amp; thank you for all your great work. Stay around please we need your good influence in Labour üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClarkeMicah To you too Peter keep up the great work üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Merry #Christmas everyone hope those celebrating have a wonderful time with loved ones. Time for a little break.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCNewsnight @KirstyWark @BBCTwo If #TonyBlair had been part responsible for the murder of a million Jews or Christians as opposed to Arab Muslims would you give this war criminal this much platform? I doubt it. Then again you are everything that‚Äôs wrong with the corrupt broken MSM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SARGEE_ Suffice to say that idiot loves Trump &amp; Farage!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YiokastiM Your move, #Conservatives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LfcBecky Happy Christmas to you too Becky :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redsarah99 @linda_whyman I understand your break but glad you got back because if you give up on all the principles you fought so hard for then they‚Äôll have won! So dust off, enjoy a mini Xmas break then jump back right in :) x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelRosenYes @LordJohnMann That‚Äôs the difference between you &amp; him, you have integrity &amp; respect<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DerbyChrisW Beautifully said &amp; happy Christmas to you too Chris. You need a good restful break badly.. detox your mind üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn Happy Christmas to you &amp; your family. Get some well earned rest &amp; come back recharged to continue your message of hope for all ‚úåÔ∏è<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@21WIRE @Partisangirl @wikileaks @EliotHiggins @Brian_Whit @MichaelNo2War Is Elliot still working from his home laptop pretending to be Mid East expert while never visiting Syria?

<|startoftext|>@il26wepo @M_AndersonSF @Kay7To @sinnfeinireland @DerrySinnFein @nadplo @USPalAffairs @CMcGin2006 @EmmaMcGinley_x @PalestineCenter Hi.., illegal Israeli settler? üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‚ÄúWhite Power‚Äù Brendan deep inside really wanted to say ‚Äú&amp; because he‚Äôs black‚Äù! Hec why not he might as well have joined in the pile on by other MSM goons quick to misquote Stormzy! #IStandWithStormzy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC &amp; that he‚Äôs black right? Brendan didn‚Äôt have the balls to say it but am sure he‚Äôd love to have done so but didn‚Äôt wanna blow his cover!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>UK &amp; USA are fully aware of the barbaric murder of #Khashoggi ordered by #MBS: but he means BIG money to them so they‚Äôll overlook this &amp; #Yemen genocide. They‚Äôll also cite ‚Äúnational security &amp; #Saudi is an ally‚Äù for extra credibility ! Amazing how cheap some lives are for UK/USA!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mirabarhillel @stevemakastevem UK &amp; USA fully aware of the barbaric murder ordered by MBS: but he means BIG money to them so they‚Äôll overlook the crime. They‚Äôll also cite ‚Äúnational security &amp; Saudi is an ally‚Äù for extra credibility !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is it wherever #USA is/intends to occupy there seems a magical resurgence of #ISIS ? It helps justify their presence &amp; control of Mid East oil certainly if there‚Äôs an enemy! Without the enemy who magically arm themselves, loaded with cash there‚Äôs no need for USA! Dubious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jlevi53 As others too, slowly coming to light. Get more Tory/Boris friendly dubious people in the circle!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@simonmaginn Agree 100% &amp; many losers out there telling you‚Äôre an antisemite for calling out illegal occupation, apartheid &amp; land theft by Israel! Am like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what Israel f...king does‚Äù! 100% what the antisemitism smear campaign against Corbyn was, purely bc he defends Palestinian rights<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‚ÄúLabour Sources‚Äù (always a suspicious title) &amp; ‚Äúmafia‚Äù? Ah yes the @thetimes mafia wrote this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jncatron &amp; so they should be scared for all the crimes #Israeli chiefs, army &amp; politicians have committed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@M_AndersonSF @nadplo Well done again Martina for giving voice to the oppressed Palestinians. #FreePalestine<|endoftext|>
