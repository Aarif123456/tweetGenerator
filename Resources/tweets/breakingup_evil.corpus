<|startoftext|>Get a load of this smirk. Please don’t think that because the sociopath (#narcissist aka #psychopath) u know didn’t carry out crimes (that you know of) on a large scale that they aren’t a #sociopath (or that they don’t have crimes under their belt).    https://t.co/0Sb7PRXH3C<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>“Devaluation” is not their goal though it’s how people feel when a sociopath “gaslights” them. The #sociopath doesn’t care how someone feels... they care only about themselves.

<|startoftext|>@funder @realDonaldTrump Nope. He’ll get away. Run into hiding as most sociopaths do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ADivorcing They keep it up, drive by, etc for the same two reasons they do everything they do: to see if they can get more and to make sure they aren’t losing or any to be in trouble. These are sociopaths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ADivorcing This is normal for them. Please know this is a sociopath. They have many people under their spell all at the same time, rotating in and out as the individual prey see through the sociopath and it ends.

<|startoftext|>@chocolatesushi @TiffanyDCross Well see the effects on England and Canada first. Then in the USA within CA Stage one in CA is old age care facilities, Stage two is prisons, Stage three is hospital and medical workers.... plenty of testing going on.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@yameater33 @cmsrtwit @TiffanyDCross Well that makes sense. To not take anew vaccine while pregnant is common sense. But by the time it’s available will have been plenty of test cases.

<|startoftext|>The system collectively and as individuals -like many prey- also unfortunately don’t take in the specific and deep, precise comprehension of a #sociopath and what that means, instead settling for the common interpretations of them that lead to suffering. #narcissist<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hoovering is a con man, #sociopath, user classic. They all do it. Always. Except when they don’t. Whether they do or don’t hoover, neither is random. It seems like it, but it isn’t.

<|startoftext|>It’s the scammer’s hope to apply for the 10-year green card w/ a still believing US spouse standing by them, but they don’t really mind if we’re not. They can apply even if you’re split-up, divorced. They do have to prove that they married you “in good faith”. #conman #sociopath<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are 2 phases of residency in the process of an emigrating spouse. The initial US “green card” is good for two-years. Then 6 months before the 2-year card expires, a 10-year card can be applied for. The immigrating person applies for this; the US spouse is not a part of that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dead silence on my end. Then he said, “You might not be ready to hear it emotionally, but that’s what happened.”<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AP Needs to be state wide and stay inside your house - no church, no protests, no gyms for god sake... all inside, no more than one adult or one adult and minor out at a time for doctors or other necessary errands. no one aside from suited-up, masked and well paid delivery people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@roflarizzle @AP These cases are from weeks ago at trump rally’s numbskull. And ppl in restaurants and your churches. Zero reports of ppl voting for Biden went out to party. Much smarter than that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SoulSoldSeprtly @AP Doesn’t include churches either. And stats show church is a super spreader and protests are not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lily95075891 @AP It’s not an illusion lily.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AP Such a joke. Only different element of any effect is restaurant dining closures.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@businessinsider Disgusting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nytopinion @Pontifex We’re in a crisis because of what’s in ppls hearts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnnbrk Who would know? Not enough, too little too late and not enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sonali_Kohli This is so not enough. And households are not possible to monitor. This is essentially the same as it has been aside from stopping eating in restaurants... not enough. Ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnnenbergMedia So basically nothing has changed except you any eat at a restaurant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@latimes Maybe they could do something about all the TV commercials with holiday parties and gatherings. - Believe it or not this will make many people want to or think it’s okay to gather and party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sapphiresdust There are tons. Statistics say 1 in 25 people are sociopaths.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TimKerwin Thanks so much for the retweet!!! I started writing and giving recovery coaching one-on-one in 2014 after escaping marriage to a maniac like trump. These are sociopaths - ppl call them narcissists. Know what they are is key to not falling into this trap. This can shift the future<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebraveryproj No it isn’t. We need to understand what he “is”. And the effect this kind of being - this kind of pathology - has upon others who admire them. And a philosophy to live from... a different “ism” that is founded in humanism.  https://t.co/O1sAXTLNwQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WalshFreedom Nope. Needed to transfer to actual home schooling which “school online” is NOT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#trump won’t concede because he’s a #sociopath; he needs to think he’s the good guy &amp; was wronged. W/this extremely limited sociopath brain he can’t realize conceding makes you look like the good guy. Sociopaths don’t understand our real world.  https://t.co/O1sAXTLNwQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@b_fleish Wow! Beautiful!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@4a_of Nope. It’s real. It’s a Getty Image file. Official photo. Looks as if the office was cleared out then #tump the #sociopath ordered a press conference and someone hauled a credenza in from the hallway so he could tell a t ppl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OurRevolution The criminal justice system fails just about everyone in every case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@democracynow Who ever that man is.... not good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@55andwhat @joncoopertweets  https://t.co/O1sAXTLNwQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimKerwin @joncoopertweets It will. Once #trump the #sociopath is out of sight they will recede as well.  https://t.co/O1sAXTLNwQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ad_Oculos_Stult @joncoopertweets Yep. I help people in the aftermath recover from personal one-on-one entanglements with this kind of beast.  https://t.co/O1sAXTLNwQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@burnwater @joncoopertweets @MeidasTouch They are. After the #sociopath - that is #trump  in this case - disappears and is diminished the ppl who were under their spell settle back into dust as well. Their current &amp; previous rage level is inspired by the coercive control element.  https://t.co/O1sAXTLNwQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ForbearTammy @joncoopertweets Good gravy what an idea. Never speak it out loud again before he hears you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarciaCaro2 @joncoopertweets They were / are under the spell of a #sociopath aka #trump. One of the elements of this phenomenon is taking into the attitudes and hatred a of the sociopath. (Sociopaths are nothing but hate and pure evil btw.)  https://t.co/O1sAXTLNwQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joncoopertweets Sure does. So much rage and hate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sapphiresdust And they are all soooooo ugly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sapphiresdust I refuse to pay $200 for a desk chair. Hideous prices.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joncoopertweets It’s not just you. It’s #trump. He’s a #sociopath - when the end of a scam arrives when their world is over they absolutely lose it. Like they are insane. - please read this article and others on this site.  https://t.co/WS7OORyPco<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@4a_of Not yet. Yet being the key word. We could in fact begin the process ... any number of plaintiffs and likely a brigade of attorneys who’d be willing. However it’s the lawyers in class actions who get the bucks not the plaintiffs. AND sociopaths never pay out. No one wld get any $<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnpavlovitz Not much is that absolute...he’s not gone yet. When he is thinsg will be much different. At this point ppl are still under his sociopath spell of coercive control.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sapphiresdust It does for me these days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@4a_of There is no wrong answer. He’ll come up w/ some kind of further fraudulent existence. We’ve seen him scam selling vodka, college, golf, gambling, hotels, TV host, condos; could be anything. He could label himself a professor next, a self help guru, a dance instructor. All fraud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrJessTaylor It’s a work thing. It lets the caller know they have the correct person/number.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joncoopertweets Not at all surprised and 100% don’t want to hear that sociopaths name or another report on him ever again. Unless it’s that he’s in prison or has died. That would be okay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeffmason1 No one wants trump at Biden’s inauguration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VoicingFreedom_ @Ryan_Daigler @MyPurplePrint @girl2RAWR He’s a sociopath. The ya re all like this because of the limitations of the brain which render someone a sociopath. 👍🏼 https://t.co/fIzNSf1VSw<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MrsRosefyre @mjfree I think so too. I think this is a back up desk they rolled in because all the real furnishings are being removed, replaced etc after his fraud presidency debacle<|endoftext|>

I have never paid any attention to him to the point I’ve only ever heard his voice about 3 times in all these 4 years. We decide what’s next.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DebraMessing 😂 As a #sociopath he will finally run away. That’s what they do when the big-jig such as this scam is up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jessecase @PattyArquette Yep.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StevenBeschloss @DavidCornDC @realDonaldTrump Nope. Once he isn’t in the line light and he’s run away to hide the effects of his spellbinding blindness and devotion will crack. Those ppl will experience sever PTSD, as all of us are in trauma these last four years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevenBeschloss @kurteichenwald Ppl under the spell of a #sociopath aka #trump do over time take on the negative qualities of jarring others and bitterness. It’s normal.

<|startoftext|>@funder Hopefully so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joncoopertweets I know it seems so, but #trump is not fighting for a “job”. He’s fighting to maintain his scam. #trump is a #sociopath Their job is conning, scamming, defrauding, taking, stealing as a livelihood &amp; survival.  https://t.co/O5joJkkMzb<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kurteichenwald Yah. He’s not a “president” he is the fraud.

<|startoftext|>@CynBlogger @soltysik_rob @terry313401 @JodiDoering Exactly. A significant number of Americans are colossally uneducated, and steeped in ignorance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DandySerendipi1 @JodiDoering Americans had no intelligent guidance from the top.

<|startoftext|>@Ryan_Daigler Their survival drives them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ryan_Daigler I don’t find any one thing they do “abusive” or more “abusive” than the other. This would imply these are actual relationships. At all times everything abt them is fraud, deception and therefore criminal; sustained crimes. What we suffer in them is natural as emotion based humans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ryan_Daigler @CCSurvivor1 Yes... a sociopath is a psychopath. They are the same thing: antisocial psychopaths and so are “narcissists”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepsForBiden Such bizarrely ill people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DebraMessing No surprise<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LarsLarsonShow @OregonGovBrown Does it limit groups? Then it’s covered.<|endoftext|>

All fluff &amp; fraud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RebeccaMcNutt2 @donwinslow And that it doesn’t mean “okay” or that its a mudra, a meditation hand position. Idiots<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donwinslow Do they not know that’s a mudra, a yogic meditation hand gesture. So dumb.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@vianel_lopez @sapphiresdust Neither is cheating: they don’t have a genuine relationship. He is a#sociopath and she may well be one. Sociopaths don’t connect, bond or love or like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ryan_Daigler @CCSurvivor1 We are a threat to their livelihood. In fact to their existence in essence. And that’s a sociopath. A covert, overt, malignant etc “narcissist” is functionally a sociopath - an antisocial psychopath.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sapphiresdust #trump already has many humans lined up to slot into place as a “wife” respectability facade as any #sociopath would.

<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 @kurteichenwald Because it’s not anywhere in his awareness.

He’s a #sociopath - a con man.  https://t.co/1XAwQrrpGc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TIME This is typical of certain #sociopaths to file lawsuits in order to look like the good guy. This is done as #trump is doing what hen in rage and absolute panic because they know their scam has failed.  https://t.co/L4ZARrh5k5<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StephenKing Geez @StephenKing you must see the kind of evil he is. I know it for real-real. Married one, escaped and guide others out of the surreal terror to restoring their lives. Scarier even than any of your amazing amazing novels.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenKing Excellent question. Answer: the day the spell of the #sociopath #tump’s coercive control snaps. They’ll hit the ground in pieces and he’ll be fully destroyed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edwardpoole1975 @s9tmt He can never be taken seriously. He’s a pathetic parasitic #sociopath and he’s been seen through by all... even those mesmerized are hanging onto it by a thread.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@smalltwngirl918 #trump can’t write. He can hire a ghost writer if anyone would accept such a revolting contract knowing you have to be in the presence of that #sociopath and likely not be paid as is the behavior every sociopath.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>🤢 🤮<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mcgruff_s @ShoveTime @davenewworld_2 She didn’t flip out for no reason. Men lose their minds in rage when women flip them off. I thought that happened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@4a_of It’s normal in the aftermath of the end of a #sociopath (#narcissist) ensnarement. Stop looking. Block, unfollow, don’t watch anymore of the 💩 The absurd comments are the frenzied fear of a sociopath knowing his scam is over. He’s scared out of his gourd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CgaMoor @davenewworld_2 Wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChaiVida @davenewworld_2 Wrong. It was the only thing that kept her safe. You have no idea what it feels like to have a man run up on you in a rage. Remember he started it... what did he do so that she flipped him off? Why is no on asking that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mcgruff_s @ShoveTime @davenewworld_2 He did soemthing first. No one flips someone off without reason ... end the misogyny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nyssard420 @Cam_Htown @davenewworld_2 Flip them off is number one. But what did he do first? What is no one asking that? I call misogyny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZipBamBoomVoila @davenewworld_2 She did not provoke him. How in the -F- is flipping a man off call for this. AND AND AND what did he do so that she flipped him off? Women have little else to defend themselves against a man. I Call Misogyny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Applelaw1Sandra @davenewworld_2 Yes he did. He assaulted her, threatened her, taunted her and should never have approached her. Men LOSE their marbles when women flip them off. This could have been much worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaetzPapi @davenewworld_2 No just no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jekahyde @davenewworld_2 No. Just no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davenewworld_2 The 1 time I flipped off a man ever I’m female-was driving in LA..anyone who’s driven on a regular basis in LA knows this isn’t unusual.

<|startoftext|>@ninafunnell @juliettemcaleer @RapeReform @marquelawyers @EROCAustralia Just as any #sociopath. They don’t think what they do is wrong.

<|startoftext|>@Suzanne43554675 @RWatson_insight Nothing repairs this abnormal brain. Their antisocial behavior is not a choice. This is how their brains function.

<|startoftext|>@Suzanne43554675 @RWatson_insight In my experience, I conclude they are born no matter their focus or desire that they pursue.

<|startoftext|>@Suzanne43554675 @RWatson_insight They are born this way. Some researchers believe the more violent version -want to see ppls pain, enjoy violence...the Psycho is born &amp; the more integrated into a facade of regular life but really a con, the Socio is made; this is a theory &amp; not the belief of all  scientists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Suzanne43554675 @RWatson_insight They are the same thing. They are medically called antisocial psychopaths. They have abnormal brains that don’t fully function.

<|startoftext|>@theonewithd @kurteichenwald @davidmweissman Yes... and planning how you carry out the bankruptcy is within legal bounds and is key.

<|startoftext|>Sociopaths have sex – or refuse to have sex for precisely two reasons. Pretty much for the same two reasons they do and say anything and everything they do or say. The reality as well as the rumors of great sex with a #sociopath fall short.  https://t.co/hVEpv1thV7  https://t.co/qL2kzmQL0E<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They aren't sticking close to hearth and home. Along with no attachment emotionally to anyone in their lives, a higher than average testosterone level and boredom compel them sexually and there are no limits. Sociopaths have no sexual or any other boundaries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@legalella This is rooted in the historical, traditional and still thriving and accepted hatred of women and gender expectations and bias and judgement.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@joncoopertweets #trump does know he’s going to lose. He’s known it for a while. He’s letting covid run rampant as you say because he doesn’t care abt people. He also just has no clue how to do anything; he isn’t a president, he isn’t a business man... he’s a #sociopath.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrianaOconnelly Hmmm.... and being in Walmart.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@unkonfined @takingbackmypo1 It isn’t about confidence alone, though is it? Because when you walk away when the spell of coercive control snaps the terror is HUGE. We do it anyway. It’s about courage of our convictions and trusting our gut.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TeacherSusanUte @SEAresource They don’t pay a cent. Sociopaths do not pay child maintenance ordered by court or not. They do sometimes try to get custody of the kids or get out of that order or expectation, but they don’t contribute regardless aside from an occasional snippet or promise to do so.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It’s normal to stay. This is an element of what I call the #sociopath effect. Had they been a normal person we’d have been able to leave them sooner. The #sociopath has a Pied Piper quality that keeps ppl hooked even as we think: this is wrong... That’s what coercive control is.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JanellJ69747067 @Jlguest @JoeBiden Trump refused to debate. An unprecedented refusal by any Presidential candidate in history. Three public debates are traditional.

<|startoftext|>Humans are “hooked” on the fact that relationships are meant to be full of trust and goodness. That’s how healthy fully human humans are wired. That will not change.

<|startoftext|>Well. Don is a sociopath. A piece of that biology is an invisible element of allure we call colloquially “charm”; it’s coercive control. It’s effect is instantaneous and automatic as a blinder and creates a compulsion to lie for and defend the sociopath if we admire or like them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ABC “Back the blue” or “backs the blue” which is it... and what the heck does that mean; a new slogan at this late date won’t save the rumpster. - And heavens to Betsy! Are we suppose dot believe this many black people from the neighborhood support this idiot?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC These are not supporters. This is background actors bused in. #Biden #BidenHarrisToSaveAmerica And why “back the blue”...  what does this mean? What? Does he know “blue” is the color for democrats?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenniferJJacobs Yah. They look excited. Matching masks, hideous turquoise tee shirts... big red hats.. who paid for that wardrobe. How early did they have to arrive to be costumed.

<|startoftext|>Sociopaths blatantly &amp; obviously hold up the imaginary compilation of many of their prey calling this an “ex” as bait to get things they need; to get us to do things they want. All they say is bait to hook an emotion that then yields things their desired direction. #sociopath<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JenniferJJacobs Central Casting did a great job!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBSNews @LanaZak That’s okay. The “audience” rounded up and wardrobed by Central Casting doesn’t care. They just want to know what’s for lunch and when their paychecks for the day will arrive by USPS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC Central Casting does another good job... hours in lines and changing tents to put on those mags costumes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN That’s great!!! Can’t imagine how any young woman could vote for trump... or anyone else for that matter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@4everNeverTrump @dougmillsnyt @realDonaldTrump Yes! Few ppl. How many hours do you think they spent in the stylists’ lines to be handed those shirts, masks and hats and get changed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dougmillsnyt @realDonaldTrump Next national decree will be we all have to wear mags uniforms. - Why do these “events” always look staged and photoshopped.

<|startoftext|>@politico That and his fear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYDailyNews So, changes that emphasis what he already is....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec @realDonaldTrump Are you a child? Or just so uneducated there’s no fathoming your ignorance?! The 25th amendment wouldn’t apply to Nancy Pelosi, doofus. She isn’t the President. Unfortunately that monstrosity is... for a few more days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CraigCaplan Absolutely. And abolish the electoral college.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN It needs to be law! That’s common sense!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>How many times have you checked Twitter today to see of its happened yet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@E_Martellozzo @cmargaret948 @MichaelGLFlood It has done since the beginning of porn...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Olivianuzzi Fantastic article. Misses the reality of sociopaths is a few spots, and accidentally hits it spot on in others... though 100% excellent abt trump (a sociopath) and his rapid spiraling into decline on all fronts 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼Great inside WH view.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Music to our ears: “Trump faces what looks like the end of his presidency. ‘He’s mishandled the coronavirus, he’s never been popular, and he’s gonna lose badly. I think it’s pretty simple,” a senior Republican official said.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry... but no... trump is not the “most important high risk person of them all”. - He’s 💩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This idiot was not contemplating his own mortality! That’s such a gorgeously human thought but it’s our kind of thought, not the thoughts of a #sociopath. Sociopaths often talk abt their own death and dying. They threaten ppl with it as a tactic to get what they want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“The person on the other end of the line couldn’t forget that unusual word the president used: dier. A seldom-said dictionary standard, it was a classic Trumpism, at once sinister and childlike.”... sociopaths have simplistic langue, difficulty w/it and often talk abt dying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hate to spoil this beautifully written article but from the first paragraphs it’s off the tracks s fat as what a sociopath means when they speak.  “I could be one of the diers,” he said. [trump said.]<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Olivianuzzi @gtconway3d It would have been another story if they’d left him alone to do as he pleased.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>H2O... Matt Damon. A real human.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BuzzFeedNews But just as gross as he is pro-trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelGLFlood @E_Martellozzo @cmargaret948 It’s obvious without research... sorry to say. Any girl or woman knows it immediately from the first awareness porn exists. Don’t know what boys think... but I know what they’re taught to think.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AaronBlake He doesn’t know what that word “cure” means. He doesn’t know what most words mean. Sociopaths are notoriously stupid. Trump is a doofus. And a sociopath.

<|startoftext|>@RepsForBiden Under a rock. Staying out of the line of Fire... they’re falling like dominos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JulieZebrak @Mimirocah1 Indeed we do; always have had.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brianschatz @davidmweissman I so do not care abt trump and his supposed COVID.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Marmel Those are beings who kill at the drop of a hat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Marmel Wow... four sociopaths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rmayemsinger Nope. Don’t watch them anyway . I do love that every time trump opens his mouth he looses votes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoJoFromJerz Fake. I agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WinningSmile12 Every sociopath plays the suicide card. They commonly talk abt killing themselves when things are going badly as just more of the same: bait. Bait to hook normal humans emotions to keep us hooked into helping them and staying and giving and trying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NDLB2020 @joncoopertweets Oh my gooooooooo-d. Surely there must’ve something we can do abt people this ignorant.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@axios Such bullshit. As if he cares or has any intelligent decision making skills.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WKBW Bullshit. It’s not safe to have trump anywhere ever. Never has been.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brad_mcclelland @kreedtheruler @ImInThisBihhhhh Wow. Just wow. The person they are assaulting or flirting with just doesn’t figure in. They don’t count 😳 I know I feel this as a woman often from men, but have never heard it articulated. 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kreedtheruler @ImInThisBihhhhh So gross<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AMacleine @ImInThisBihhhhh I feel encouraged. This explains that the people who support trump are not actually doing so based in any real thought or awareness. Also O can see more than half of these people interviews here will realize a new something from this. This is the best way to get through to them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marinthehouse @TheBackShopPC @ImInThisBihhhhh @_Pharod Or a plus sign. The guy really doesn’t know that “-“ between two consecutive numbers represents “to” or “through”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dmarcontell @ImInThisBihhhhh These are such colossally uneducated people. Their IQs as well are close to the ground. Or something just so wrong... Likely no experience or view of anything other than a very very small life.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mkraju This is significant. It means he is extremely threatened and knows he will loose. This is when sociopaths go nuts. This is a sign he will do anything to stop them winning but even on a personal level against her physically. This is normal for sociopaths ... @KamalaHarris<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MalcolmNance Naturally, and they are doing this kidnapping at Trumps behest and request.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DWUhlfelderLaw You can sue him when he is no longer president. Feel free.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thekjohnston He’s a sociopath. This is normal for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sapphiresdust Of course. And the threat of Trump will not be over when he looses. He’s a sociopath! I am amazed that @KamalaHarris and @JoeBiden do not have an advisor on how to defuse a sociopath!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neeratanden Trump is always sick... a sick sociopath. Right now he’s a scared sociopath.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmmyA2 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyceWhiteVance It means he hates women.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AynRandPaulRyan That’s a real question...?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandyRainbow Why does the fly have to be “slutty”...? ....More imbedded hatred of women.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden @KamalaHarris Please be aware: Donald Trump is a sociopath. So are many of his comrades. When a sociopath fears loosing all they have taken by fraud and then being exposed they instigate physical harm. Being called a monster by Trump as is a sign he is wild animal scared and will attack her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HKrassenstein Absolutely. Fire this maniac.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AureHope @Woman_on_Pause @realDonaldTrump No surprise. Expect more of this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden @KamalaHarris 💕💕💕💕💕Watch our. After calling you a monster... this signifies Donald’s trauma; his awareness he is loosing; his awareness he’ll be in big big trouble now... and his intentions of actual harm towards you. This is how sociopaths work.  https://t.co/O1sAXTLNwQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HKrassenstein Yes... the covid thing he hoped would get him out of it. Honestly it’s possible he didn’t doesn’t have covid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Karoli @Marmel @KamalaHarris Yes! When a sociopath calls you a monster, devil, or evil they are at their wits end and scared out of their gourd. He knows she will win and he will be “in trouble”. It’s traumatic for him. And it’s also a sign she is in danger; in this rage they do anything. Anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDweck He is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TallJosephine These are adorable!!!! (You can show them off even more clearly - photograph them on a white back ground - I know 😂 and bring out the colors with a few tweaks in your cell phone camera edits.)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Kwags1981 @davidmweissman 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Birdie18th @davidmweissman So agree!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@COtriMom @davidmweissman Naturally blue is pro life. Honestly: no one wants babies destroyed. Trump doesn’t seem to care about anyone but himself. There is no sense coming out of him; just so much hate it’s mind boggling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ExceptInPereira @davidmweissman A madman sound alike a very bad idea. That madman has hurt us all.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KamalaHarris As it ought to have been. FYI: when a sociopath calls someone a monster, the devil etc... which they do when they are profoundly afraid of loosing and enraged, be sure to understand you are in danger. They mean you harm.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@matthewjdowd Oh believe me. As a woman, I’m aware. It is very deeply and profoundly accepted to hate women all over the world, including in the USA. It is experienced and visible everyday of your life if you’re born female.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Yamiche When sociopaths say bad things about someone else and call someone names they are talking about themselves. They know what they are.

<|startoftext|>@Leslieoo7 @IvankaTrump Exactly! Staged photos of a fraud in the act of fraud! All pretend. Classic sociopath. This photo shoot is named Trump Covid by the photographer...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewFeinberg @realDonaldTrump 😂 😂 😂 staged photos of him signing a blank piece of paper!! 😂 😆 sociopaths aren’t so transparent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRealHoarse I’ll wager he doesn’t have covid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NaomiBiden Well. There are people on this earth who get away with things until we all stop them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sherry_rica @maggieNYT @Lawrence He may not have it. We don’t really know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MerrillLynched @maggieNYT @peterbakernyt No. He’s a sociopath.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jessedambra @maggieNYT Yes. Sociopaths tend to look very much alike due to their abnormal brains that render them sociopathic aka psychopaths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ginja0 @maggieNYT A body man is a personal assistant. Have you seen VEEP? With Julia Louis Dreyfus. The guy who carries her lipstick and shoes and make Susie her driver is waiting...?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cladius67300655 @maggieNYT A personal assistant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@braddrinks @maggieNYT @yashar They need advisers because that’s the only one who has even a grain of intelligence. They do not know what they’re doing. They also need someone to blame when it all goes wrong. Standard sociopath practice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carmatta @maggieNYT @maddow It’s all staged fake BS. He doesn’t have covid.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ssirenss14 @maggieNYT U.S. political jargon, a civilian personal assistant. Is with the politician everywhere. Arranges transport, lodging, interactions with media, public &amp; family, meals, personal briefings &amp; briefing papers, makes sure their tie is straight...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Marmel Yah. A publicity campaign featuring a supposedly ill “president”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump Nothing can stop him from lying and scamming. Nothing stops him from his blushing. What’s he signing? He took time to stage fake photos of fake work and he’s supposedly ill? You’re all such liars.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@travisakers Excellent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just in case people don’t realize they this con man is staging photos of himself while supposedly in the hospital with covid.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DrJessTaylor It pretty much is. Humans are basic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Sociopaths don’t have linear logic. They focus on and make a statement related to the moment at hand only. Moment to moment in that moment saying what they perceive they need to say to get away with what they’ve done, are doing  and want to do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump Nothing can stop him from lying and scamming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kurteichenwald Sociopath... Trump is a sociopath.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthewjdowd That would be if they cared. But if they cared we wouldn’t be where we are now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliVelshi @JoyAnnReid The doctors aren’t disclosing the info abt tRumps health because it’s fake. He doesn’t have covid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevenBeschloss Absolutely. The thing is, the truth of sociopathy is the hardest thing to take in even for those escaping and recovering from personal true love scams with these beasts. I guide ppl through this recovery daily. The spell breaks eventually.   https://t.co/oBS59q16OT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhdksafa I did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donwinslow And is likely all untrue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidmweissman It’s all make up either version.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@richard680news Another sociopath. He and don can buddy up in the big house.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@richard680news He’s not sick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here go more of our tax dollars. Trump on vacation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChatChristi @realDonaldTrump He kills us. He’s a sociopath. Look that up. He’d grab your P- and sell you to Putin before he’d so much as give you the time of day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonnaMi75957880 @realDonaldTrump Exactly. He’s a criminal for withholding life threatening information.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HolenaJohn @realDonaldTrump Oh, John. No. This man is a criminal. A pedophile. A sex trafficker, incites violence, racism &amp; hatred. Tax fraud for hundreds of millions of dollars that will come out of your pocket to pay back. He’ll be taking your social security &amp; health care too. More Kool Aide?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WakeUpAmerica70 @realDonaldTrump No. Don is a sociopath.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AynRandPaulRyan How do we know...?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clairecmc Because he’s not... I believe it’s all a lie until there is verifiable proof otherwise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReallyAmerican1 Completely bamboozled.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>News outlets saying the bad wishes for tRump and his ”COVID” go against the standards, the practices of social media! 😂 😂 😂 😂 Because you know - his didn’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@renato_mariotti I’m out. So many lies about this one covid situation it is mind bending. How did anyone follow this maniac all these four years...?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@laurenpeikoff Except that eh was on oxygen while in the White House... Uhm...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonLeopold Wow. Sounds like BS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abbydphillip They knew. What’s bout tRump is not shocking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sahilkapur Yep. Dancing the dance of concealing truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBSNews You can see reporters don’t believe the Dr. answers and keep checking for wording for lies or double meaning. - Thanks don.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pvssyjuice_ I don’t know. It was on Twitter the same morning Don Trump announced being ill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepsForBiden I won’t have to immediately leave the USA for good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HillaryzMyHmgrl @neeratanden All sociopaths are very nervous about illness especially though STDs. However they don’t take precautions; they test frequently this at as we hear trump ha seven with covid. I personally don’t believe he has it. They fake illnesses to get out of things; common to all sociopaths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neeratanden We have no way of knowing if any of that is true ... I don’t believe that it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kurteichenwald He doesn’t have it. Bet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AilsaRayner He’s a sociopath.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidmweissman @kurteichenwald No he has not. I doubt any of them have COVID. He’s lying. Sociopaths do this. While it makes no sense or is, there is absolutely sociopath logic in this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan @Jaymie65195962 He’s lying... he did not test positive. Bet a $1.00<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaketapper @sandibachom He lying. He does not have COVID.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HKrassenstein Not to see that he’s okay. Maybe to see that he’s not lying about having COVID. But a hospital photo can be faked. The sociopath I married did just that. They pull anything they can when the scam is blowing up to get empathy and be let off as a “good guy”. #LiarInChief<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@maddow 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 Yah. That was ten hours ago... if he’s got covid where are the actual facts and updates. And not a peep about Melania. I call BS.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan @sandibachom We knew that would be their response. We’ll see tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmceeNhoopz @nytimes Well for that one would have to believe there’s a god. Sociopaths do not. They cannot. They are missing the parts of the brain that care, bond, connect and feel things like spirituality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grandmagrit Yes!!! And I go out extremely rarely. Now I wear a mask and a face shield.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chafkin Speak for yourself. Not me!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmceeNhoopz @nytimes It can’t be humbling for a sociopath. Donald is a sociopath. Humbling is not an emotion they can feel. They are pure evil; the devil.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EmceeNhoopz @nytimes Humbling...? For donald...? No. Nothing “humbles” a sociopath. This is his way to bail. They do fail and then bail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mkennedy81 @nytimes Agree. He could 100% be lying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nytimes There’s no way to trace it! Too many contacts. He exposed so many people. And at that event Melania is seared next to a row of children!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AynRandPaulRyan Do you see Melania seated next to a row of children!?!?!? How are those little kids?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reuterspictures Dirtbags.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Out5p0ken @sandibachom She may get it again.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nycsouthpaw @JoyAnnReid Gooood gravy!!!!! Melania next to those children!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brithume Why? I don’t get it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CapitalOneCafe Ridiculous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid The high contagion period is two days before you feel the first symptoms. And then for 14 days... and until the fever has been gone for three days without fever reducing medications and other symptoms are reduced. That’s from the contact tracing certification study materials.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sapphiresdust A den of sociopaths and their acolytes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thekjohnston Phhht what symptoms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sapphiresdust Only if he’s actually sick and to a specific degree<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davematt88 Not impossible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdlingerDr @trish_regan He will not win. This COVID BS will be his undoing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@birdrrf @trish_regan You really didn’t know what he is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MagicMousMisfit It’s the sociopath go to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickAdamsinUSA Not by half.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BreitbartNews Certainly. Absolutely possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast @thekjohnston It’s all they’ve got.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donwinslow @thekjohnston @FoxNews Theres no need to stop. Trump can campaign where ever he is. Nothing stopped him before. There’s YouTube, Zoom, other digital platforms, Twitter and etc. his Aides and lackeys can do it all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jessicam6946 We did see him walk... he was waking as they took him to Walter reed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 No surprise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Midnightmunch10 @CNBC Trump hates everyone that’s for sure!! As any sociopath does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WashTimes A sociopath weaponizes absolutely anything and everything. Most especially human emotions. As a sociopath #Trump thinks the empathy normal people would feel over him being ill will bring him votes and or give him a graceful “good-guy-victim” out when he looses the election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trish_regan I don’t think you know what that word means. A persons opinion is not “a conspiracy”. Trump could easily be lying about COVID. He, like any sociopath, lies about all things and tells stories to preempt truths and get what they want. Either way, this is his final undoing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet Nope. No sociopath is a genius.  https://t.co/MTBMdpRekH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet Trump is no genius. He’s what every sociopath is. Yes: pure evil. Genius, never. Just because they do things we’d never think of to get what they want without conscience or care doesn’t make them geniuses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mercedesschlapp @BreitbartNews Please. When has Trump ever told the truth. He could more than easily not have COVID. Whether he does have it or not: this will be his final undoing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickAdamsinUSA Oh no, Michael Moore is not the biggest scumbag by a long shot!!! 😂 That orange monstrosity is!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BreitbartNews That’s not a conspiracy theory. It’s an opinion. It happens to be mine as well. Sociopaths fake illness to get out of things. In this case to get out of debates that loose him votes. And to gain empathy because he thinks this will bring him votes. He’s just a sociopath.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent Duh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brad_dickson No.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kurteichenwald When has anything he says been true. You need to stop calling ppl who doubt him loony .... it will bite you. Wether he’s lying or not this will be his undoing rather than gain him anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid Trump is a sociopath; an “antisocial psychopath” wether ppl can take this in or not. Sociopaths fake illness; it’s one of their go-tos to get out of usually: that “talk” in “relationships”. It’s avoid the debates which lose him votes. He thinks this will bring votes via empathy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@joyjacks @david_scientist @JCDCF1 @politvidchannel He’s very likely not Covid positive. He’s using it to get out of this. If it’s a lie it will back fire and if it’s real it won’t be good. Ironically either way Covid will be more of his undoing. Sociopaths are their own undoing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joyjacks @david_scientist @JCDCF1 @politvidchannel Trump is a sociopath. They do anything at all to gain what ever it is they desire. Their brains are incredibly simplistic and entirely self focused. It’s to avoid looking dumb in debates he loses.

<|startoftext|>@kurteichenwald We don’t know that it’s true. Sociopaths lie about all things.

<|startoftext|>@DrJessTaylor Simple. Because the trauma of others scares humans. If it’s downplayed or belittled or the blame of the trauma is turned onto the traumatized person then others feel like this disaster could never happen tot them. It’s out of fear.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SarahEBond Wow! So beautiful!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joncoopertweets True. I would advise Biden to let trump rampage at each successive debate. When he interrupts let him rip. Then when he runs out of steam get back to his point as of trump wasn’t there and hadn’t interrupted.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CCCBuryStEd Therapy is not usually very helpful. This isn’t something your average therapist is equipped to handle and does not understand.

<|startoftext|>@politvidchannel @PattyArquette Maybe he’ll be the next to turn up “suicide”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulsperry_ It’s because trump is a #sociopath.

<|startoftext|>@UROCKlive1 @gtconway3d @JoeBiden Nope. And yes. But nope. Two separate pieces of bait. One the threat: you’ll never see me again.

<|startoftext|>@gtconway3d Sure he does... that’s one thing sociopaths know: there is no god. They don’t however understand our world or language. They always give away what they are with their ridiculous lack of comprehension.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Suzanne43554675 @narcabuserehab @Recoveryaftern1 A sociopath pretends to have this spiritual ability in order to make themselves trusted by others so that they can make use of them.

<|startoftext|>@Recoveryaftern1 You’re referring to a sociopath. No they have no religion whatsoever. They can’t. Sociopaths exist due to an abnormal brain that renders them unable to care, love, like or have any emotional or spiritual sensation. They  use other ppl as objects to fulfill their wants &amp; needs.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TrentCapelli @AlisonB12244537 That’s a generalization but no #MAGA kool aide drinkers do not know what socialism is.

<|startoftext|>After it's over, there will unfortunately, be those who believe every word the #sociopath says about us.

<|startoftext|>@HKrassenstein He’s not running for president. He is a #psychopath just like trump<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ELLEmagazine And we care...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sparkiestgerm @gottogetoutof @ganjapreneur A lot of empty dispensaries on the horizon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CondoleezzaRice Then how could you be so...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrianaOconnelly Oops typos... nothing he’s ever done that’s normal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gtconway3d I’m just sickened at what we’ve let that maniac do. Why are we still waiting on a vote to remove him?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeeTwoCents @davidmweissman Joe really needs to stop talking about trump and talk about what he’s going to do as president. We all know trumps a #psychopath. I’m amazed we’re waiting all these four years like polite little kids waiting to vote that maniac out. Stunning how compliant we are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrianaOconnelly Theres nothing was ever done that normal. He’s not normal. Aside from normal for a #psychopath<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@keith3048 @BerylGonePink Of course. donald trump is a #sociopath We need to take in the reality of what that is and stop expecting him to be something he can never be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoingGreyRock Of course. That’s a sociopath your describing... and why and how would they ever be soemthing they are not? A sociopath is a sociopath due to an abnormal brain that underfunctions in a specific and very limited way. That can’t be anything else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FRibersson Boundaries are not the problem aside form the absence of any notion of limits or boundaries by the #sociopath<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HKrassenstein No. He’s just a #sociopath.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReynoldsVaughan @AynRandPaulRyan It doesn’t hurt a #sociopath for themselves lies are real and real is made up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SlowBoiledFrog They have abnormal brains that don’t function fully. So what’s left is very limited and specific. 👍🏼<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MeidasTouch He’s just a #sociopath<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ConservBlue2020 Yes. Anyone not wearing a mask is n idiot and endangering all of us<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sapphiresdust Just one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sandibachom True. Kool-aide drinkers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AynRandPaulRyan This doesn’t help. We all know he’s lying. He knows he’s lying. Calling out a sociopath publically only makes them do more incredibly harmful and destructive things to those they consider their prey: in this case every resin in the USA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthewjdowd Oh well pedophiles stick together<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeidasTouch I can’t wait until he’s gone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Yes please. Including all new construction must be net zero energy, and all existing structures fitted for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahcpr Indeed . He is a scammer, a con man aka a sociopath<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepsForBiden This is typical for a sociopath when they are aware their entire scam is failing. This is incredible trauma for them. They loose motor skills, their already weak grasp of language diminishes, and they seem well: insane.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Acosta @sandibachom Exactly the best a #sociopath without emotional connection to the plight could say. I hope you’re not expecting #TrumpIsALoser to care. He does not. He cannot. He is not a normal person. He’s an antisocial psychopath.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Acosta @sandibachom The words of someone w/ no sympathy, empathy &amp; certainty no compassion; zero emotional link to the situation.

<|startoftext|>@narceducator @davidfrum Yes. And to take in a profound and comprehensive understanding of what a sociopath is ... they are all 100% narcissistic; a sociopath (which is an antisocial psychopath) is 100% pure narcissism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Victim_Focus But inside every family, school, church, grandparents or relatives home where it happens since the beginning of time people have always known.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Weinsteinlaw @HillaryClinton @KamalaHarris @MayaRudolph His paid crowd. Like a casting cattle call.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Victim_Focus And to be more precise: that’s men in our society who make the rules who expect women to fight back and if they didn’t fight back they wanted it and no matter what they asked for it. We all know that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Victim_Focus I’m well aware<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast And we’re surprised?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What they do is due to the way the #sociopath brain doesn’t function; parts of their brains aren’t turned on. They cannot care &amp; therefore have no conscience or remorse.

<|startoftext|>@DebraMessing @Ojeda4America Of course it’s good vs. evil. In reality all is. It’s turning evil to function for good. Good and evil are not two separate entities. Which is difficult to believe and difficult to understand. So in the meantime... vote Biden. Seriously.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SollenbergerRC He’s a #sociopath. If we don’t stop expecting him to be normal &amp; gaping at him, we lose more. This is standard behavior for a sociopath.

<|startoftext|>@PattyArquette Yes. #trump does hate Americans. As any ordinary #sociopath would Trump hates every single living being aside from himself with a hate we cannot imagine. If you could fee the depth and breadth of his hatred all at once your head would explode; you’d loose your mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pritt_bobbi @sapphiresdust Yah. That’s what a sociopath does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2020 is for sure the most f-ed up year in the history of life on earth aside from that year the dinosaurs croaked.

We mostly don’t know that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NPDsurvivors @Owlcatoro They live by what they think is right as well... imagine that. #Sociopaths are purely evil since they are sociopaths due to parts of the brain not functioning they Have no connection or care and so have no worries about the things they do. They don’t think they do bad things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump We need to stop caring about whether or not donny dumpster knows about the ratings numbers, about the videos we have of him lying and inciting civil war...

<|startoftext|>@HKrassenstein tRump doesn’t care if this goes viral... not really. He’d call it fake. Lies. What the Dems want you to think because they can’t help America. Why ain’t he in prison yet? Let’s get that movement going. #TrumpIsACriminal<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DaiglerRyan It is. Naturally the court doesn’t frame it that way. They have legal terms .. .

They are born with abnormal brains .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaiglerRyan Tons of men are entrapped by sociopaths just as women are. Happens all the time. There are both male and female sociopaths and they prey upon everyone and anyone. They are genderless and cross any gender line to prey upon whomever they want to.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mitc1205_connie @MiaFarrow @sabres4jeff That’s great!!! And thank you for letting us know. I also believe that not wearing make up and not coloring one’s hair does not mean you aren’t taking care of yourself. 👍🏼💕🙏🏼<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SFKevin4 @MiaFarrow Uh... the women in tRumpville are so not beautiful. They r extremely to me.

<|startoftext|>They are #psychopath “buddies”. Sociopaths aka psychopaths (what many people calls #narcissist). A #sociopath will team up with another or more than one- as we can see- there is however always the lead #nutjob. Before the end they eat one another alive.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TimeToRecover74 A “time out”!!!! Holy-moley. The things they come up with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The power of coercive control is something that is invisible. People don’t get hooked in because they don’t know the signs of  abuse. People get hooked because of not knowing how to recognize a #pathological user when one says “hello”. #sociopath #narcissist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@queenadventures Uhm right. However the power of coercive control is something that is invisible. People don’t get hooked in because they don’t know the signs of  abuse.

<|startoftext|>People who are lied to, deceived, made use of, beaten, economically bound, sexually blackmailed or tortured in what they began as what seemed to be a real and loving relationship-like anyone in a war zone -pull strength from their life to survive. #fraud #gaslighting #sociopath<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Narcissism like any -ism, is a way of thinking. There’s no part of narcissism that is healthy or good. The piece that makes #narcissism excludes and disconnects from others and when it’s to a pathological level you have a human who functions as a #sociopath.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SurvivorAODV Yes. I’m well aware. I have a client currently who’s 5-yr old was given to the opioid-addict #sociopath non biological father for primary custody.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnWest_JAWS @s9tmt @pritipatel So they can hurt, maim and kill<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#sociopaths have parts of the brain that don’t function. They have no empathy; they can’t understand or share others feelings. Have no compassion; they have no desire to alleviate the suffering of others. They  don’t feel like, love, or care. Stop calling them #narcissists<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kazzacoey @s9tmt I totally feel for you. So you know the Republicans entered a clause into the HEALS Act that prohibits lawsuits against employers for employees returning to work who get sick with #covid?

<|startoftext|>@SurvivorAODV Never spent a second in therapy after the life-jacking by the #sociopath. Therapy isn’t typically helpful for this. &amp; sociopaths cannot be helped by therapy.

<|startoftext|>@sapphiresdust Depends... I’ve been in a great one for 8 years with someone 18 years younger than me. The timing of it was perfect for both of us... but after a certain age marker it just doesn’t hold together. We were 21 and 39. Maybe if we’d been 51 and 79...? No! 😂 it was great then tho!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Digit_Resrch As I said in a reply earlier: the definition of empathy is sharing and understanding another’s feelings. Compassion is the desire to relieve people’s suffering. They are two different though related emotions &amp; feelings. Empathy can include judgement; compassion does not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#sociopaths can’t effectively contort or conjure an accurate mimic of the facial expression for the emotion &amp; feeling  they’re pretending because these are emotions they don’t have and feelings they don’t have. They are minus both #empathy &amp; #compassion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Digit_Resrch Empathy is relating to and sharing another’s feelings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrianaOconnelly 👍🏼The more you skip, the better! 👍🏼💕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Compassion is key. #Empathy is a narrower emotion. #Compassion is all encompassing and includes the desire to relive the suffering of another.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrGinaSimmons @dlhampton @Forbes Compassion is key. #Empathy is a narrower emotion. #Compassion is all encompassing and includes the desire to relive the suffering of another.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrianaOconnelly Please stop torturing yourself reading and listening to the ravings I’d #sociopaths. It’s not worth it and  is damaging to your mental, physical and total health  and well being. We know what they’re about. There will be nothing new.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DangerousPlayg3 Right!?!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are capable of infinite compassion for all which is much stronger than #empathy: the ability to share &amp; understand feelings of another. #Compassion is a feeling when confronted w/ another's suffering &amp; then feel motivated to relieve that suffering. #sociopaths can do neither.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Light_Life_Love If there’s fraud and extracting things from you that is a #sociopath. These are not #narcissists<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmmaJaneStanle2 It isn’t denial. It’s normal under the spell of coercive control o defend them, to stay, even to lie for them. In addition we do not have any idea of what is really going on. We don’t know this evil actually exists or what the reason is for all the odd stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmmaJaneStanle2 Yah.. I get that... We could also redefine some of these ideas of marriage, it’s purpose, it’s function. Many ppl married for 50 years were never happy in it; married a long time doesn’t equate to happiness. Happiness is happiness; has nothing to do w/ marriage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dlhampton Nope. Don’t like stuff or extra stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhiNight “Narcissism” is a bad thing there’s no element of it that’s good. That isn’t a part of the definition of narcissism. Sociopaths are 100% pure narcissism.

<|startoftext|>Think of everything the #sociopath says as “bait” vs. gaslighting. Their entire being is only aware of &amp; focused on tapping an emotion of ours (w/ bait = words).

<|startoftext|>You couldn’t be familiar w/it’s a relationship...#sociopaths do not have relationships.They make use of others as impersonal and unimportant objects. The value of the object lies in what advantage or current fulfillment of a need of the #sociopath that object represents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They absolutely do not loathe themsleves. This mistaken idea of them comes from projections our human ideas upon them as well as the really harmful idea that they are #narcissists and that a #narcissist is “made” by a bad childhood etc. #sociopaths are born with abnormal brains.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhiNight God is not a concept they comprehend or believe in. A #sociopath borrows the things they see normal ppl accept as good to make themselves seem normal. This can be any religion or school of thought or therapy terminology. Some ppl mistakenly call them a #narcissist tho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please note this does not happen becuz u have no #boundaries  #sociopaths do what they want.

<|startoftext|>@gtconway3d @duty2warn Those who speak up, naturally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This does not occur due to you being “#codependent”, or having #lowselfesteem or not having #boundaries It happens because #sociopaths exist - even if you’re calling them a #narcissist - The limited &amp; predictable mind of a #pathological human is what we must profoundly comprehend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s all about the #sociopath themselves in a very specific, predictable &amp; limited way.

<|startoftext|>@YahYah24 @Light_Life_Love Sociopaths are easy peasy to spot when you fully comprehend what they are &amp; what that means.

<|startoftext|>@Light_Life_Love This is what life is. The moment to money struggle to manifest our enlightened nature rather than allow our delusion and fundamental darkness prevail.

<|startoftext|>Similar to #ptsd fear looms &amp; logical thinking &amp; balanced management of emotions diminishes. If beliefs which cause the fears shift that changes.

<|startoftext|>Fear is a thing represented in the brain. When fear looms large other functions such as logical thinking and balanced management of our emotions diminishes. That’s temporary if you shift beliefs which cause the fears. What we believe, our philosophy matters most in life.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>They simply don’t take responsibility not that they’re “good” at this; that would mean we wouldn’t notice it or understand that’s what they’re doing.

<|startoftext|>@JacklenaB @truelovescam They simply don’t.

<|startoftext|>@ptsdandillness Hmm... it might. I’ve had clients say, “it’s okay.” And one client say it helped stop memories of specific incidents.

<|startoftext|>@TimeToRecover74 Yah... that’s normal: and that’s a sociopath.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Calling a #sociopath on lying does not incite a sociopath to say: “oh gosh yah, I’m a sociopath con man, sorry, I’ll be good now.” It does let them know that we see they them.

<|startoftext|>@Weinsteinlaw Right. So now what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC I don’t think their hatred is based in any system other than wanting to win.

Nothing like a deliberate system; just arrogant sociopathy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sandibachom Hmmm... good questions. But tRump - as a sociopath is of h th Edmond to do things out of anger/rage in an effort to get what he wants. When he hears we’re voting by mail to sidestep voter fraud: yes - he would shut down the post office Thats basic thinking; not sophisticated.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BerylGonePink @Light_Life_Love It’s very simplistic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BerylGonePink @Light_Life_Love Well yah. They do what they do out of their own interest.

<|startoftext|>@Parkerlawyer Good gravy I’d do it for you!!

<|startoftext|>@MThriving I have seen again &amp; agin that people who have expert dysfunction or abuse recognize it more sharply &amp; clearly than those with perfect or supportive childhoods so this is why more ppl from troubled childhoods or struggles know they went thru in narcissistic abuse. It’s a benefit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ADivorcing The “closure” (who made up that concept &amp; it comes from the other person?!) is in sorting out the truth; separating the crime of fraud &amp; comprehending the sociopath brain &amp; motivation; taking in what neurotypical is &amp; how amazing you are as such inside &amp; out. Resolve loss.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ADivorcing Sending to them would only create more pain. These are ppl who don’t connect, bond or care. Sorry but that’s the real truth of it. The healing is in resolving the loss of what u thought was real but wasn’t. Parts were real but not any parts/the deceptive disingenuous fraud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Onesmallvoice4 I call the dirtbag who married me the fraudster who hijacked me temporarily and the sociopath who scammed me and the nutjob lunatic who scammed me for a green card. I always take the long way round and name it what it was as in- not- relationship but fraud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Onesmallvoice4 I do want to offer up something to think abt to fold into your healing; while I understand saying “my” ex and “mine” is a language shortcut, is he or was he ever “yours”? Do u claim “him”? I see these as crimes vs. relationships &amp; depersonalize the pronouns or how we refer to thm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Onesmallvoice4 You’re right to feel he could kill you. I knew the guy I married could kill me at a certain moment and spent the rest of time making sure he didn’t. He was never violent w/me until the last weeks he began taunting as in following me as I drive from his car.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Onesmallvoice4 Every sociopath can easily kill. They don’t all do so. Some plan: Scott Peterson and that ilk. Mostly it’s in a moment when they’re up against a wall from their pov, feeling sowmthing very bad abt them is abt to be revealed or a way-good thing(fraud relationship) is blowing up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Onesmallvoice4 Oh there’s more! 😂 every sociopath has the potential to kill ppl, engage in rape, bdsm, all kinds of horrors. The only variation sociopath to sociopath is IF they do some of these things or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s normal to stay &amp; try in relationships. The element of the inherent coercive control a #sociopath (abuser) has effects us immensely &amp; immediately to do things we’d never otherwise do &amp; to defend &amp; protect them; to feel we’d die w/out them. #narcissist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HeatherHammett3 @gottogetoutof Because you’re normal. It’s normal to stay &amp; try in relationships.

<|startoftext|>@Onesmallvoice4 Let me say what ur finding is not unusual. The nutbag I married is wanted in six countries for felony fraud under an alias. Has 18 kids, a wife, lived w/3 other women, had 3 fiancés, 15 so-called girlfriends, 3 guys, 3 teens dead due to him, theft, more This is not unusual.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time to stop being spun emotionally with what he says / does. Time to get a true and real grip on what a sociopath aka psychpath is and understand taht brain to maneuver tRump out #DumpTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Onesmallvoice4 Oh!! Thanks for retweeting!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>tRump is a sociopath. Religion, political beliefs, societal considerations... none of this has meaning to him. As a #sociopath all things are instruments to use to pose in varying “looks” in attempts to ensnare ppls trust so he can do whatever he wants &amp; not be interfered with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProjectLincoln We know what tRump did. I’m more interested to hear what being “Catholic” means to Biden. What is his philosophy on life, gender roles, economic equality, etc. I don’t automatically consider someone declaring Christianity good. Who gives an f about tRump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Onesmallvoice4 Going to cops is typically shocking, disappointment, alternately it can open a trail of mess u want no part of &amp; does not benefit u. They r usually not needed. If it’s crimes he’s committed u want to report unless they were committed against u cops consider that heresay / gossip<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Onesmallvoice4 I work with many thousands of people and they share as they like and reach results. Just an offer since you stated publicly that you have confusion and inferred what I perceived as overwhelm about it. It’s naturally up to you. Good luck!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@narcabuserehab Right. And can all be healed. Starting with basic remedies and even new perspective on what was going on. 🙏🏼👏🏼💕👍🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Onesmallvoice4 Sorry for the Siri typos!!! They get by me most times!! I did mean I can decode the situations, circumstances what they do and say and we lean into making all to your benefit; we maneuver them out. And heal, recover, resolve loss, restore &amp; can become user &amp; abuser proof forever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Onesmallvoice4 Email me if you like: jennifer@truelovescam.com Take a look at my website first as you like:  https://t.co/oBS59q16OT I guide ppl thru this horror show and to restoration.

<|startoftext|>@Newmanin2018 This is normal behavior for sociopaths. Not all of us find this out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We tend to describe pathological users in terms of how what they do makes us feel: IN FACT they r only &amp; totally: a closed world of self; believe they r the most amazing person on the planet; they own everything &amp; can take it &amp; have it; can do whatever they want to do. That’s all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lovelylittlere1 @Newmanin2018 Scared out of your “gourd”... not hours<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Newmanin2018 I found: 18 kids, a wife, 3 women he lived with, 3 fiancés, 15 girlfriends, 3 men and so much more. Naturally everyone was prey &amp; not a relationship... sociopaths don’t have relationships- these are crimes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@betrayedwife3 @FLUASRP @Newmanin2018 Sociopaths hav every time brains. They can’t comprehend most things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lovelylittlere1 @Newmanin2018 This is normal how you’re feeling. And while you sit in the trauma reactio and CPTSD he is digging in behind your back causing more harm to your life... Please break away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lovelylittlere1 @Newmanin2018 Uhm that sounds like your’re still in it. You’re using present tense and looking in his phone. This is normal that you are numb and nauseated the thought of this and scared out of your hours. Pls let these feelings be enough to get away. Go zero contact. Save your life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>tRump has a core and beliefs and a philosophy. They’re of the mind of an antisocial psychopath rather than a neuro-normal human. Here it is: to take, to use, to do whatever he wants &amp; not be stopped w/zero care &amp; disgust &amp; contempt for everyone outside his own physical body.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mac123_m @s9tmt No thanks . We’re living itI need comedy to watch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaiglerRyan It’s not the control that is their goal. It’s the freedom to do whatever they want. Very different. We do feel controlled or influenced due to the invisible hypnotic element: coercive control.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaiglerRyan They are<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaiglerRyan There is no devaluing - we give it that name because it hurts - it isn’t what they are actually doing; their motivation is directly focused on their gain not our loss. Then they se sour devastation as a sign that they are successful at keeping us hooked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaiglerRyan Ppl use love bomb, gaslight, devalue, Hoover... it’s all bait. Everything they say is abt them &amp; their innate compulsion to make use of others as their only what to “relate” or behave. They need our emotional response to bring them “more” &amp; inspire us to not expose them.Thats it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Light_Life_Love And therefore: it is not kindness. A sociopath has no kindness.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@w_peckham @Amy_Siskind Contact tracing works to discover where someonw got ill and who else they exposed if its carried. I didnt invent it; it wanst invented for Covid. Its standard public health practices for infectious diseases.  Why so Snotty?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Fonsia @Amy_Siskind Yes. That is the element of coercive contrail taht sociopath such as tRump have as an innate trait that effects and ensnared others to drink the kool aid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w_peckham @Amy_Siskind This makes no sense aside from yes PERHAPS it’s not known where he got it. However as soon as he became a case officially a contact tracer would work w/ him to discern where he was exposed &amp; who he exposed &amp; then warn those he may also have infected. That’s public health policy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TexHoopie @Amy_Siskind tRump does not have a conscience. He’s what’s called an antisocial psychopath. You can rad about them here (and other places)  https://t.co/oBS59q16OT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jennie_SC @Rob38638531 @TappinTerence @Amy_Siskind No one here said anyone deserves to die. They will die however without masks and if that inspires others to put masks on that’s a good thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmericaIsDamned @Amy_Siskind Donald Trump will never care about anyone. He is a sociopath. They don’t have the brain functionality that includes connection, bonding or caring for anyone aside from themselves much better off accepting that and not expecting him to care.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CNN This is standards sociopath commentary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN Sociopaths know no one likes them once they see through them. Saying something like this is an empathy ploy. It’s bait. Humans (who are still sucked into his spell) see it as an admission of a vulnerability and so give another chance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimeToRecover74 It’s not just you. I know how it feels an eye sit hurts but his motivation for bad behavior isn’t actually about you at all. This kind of human doesn’t like or love anyone. They make use of people.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Sociopaths suck in anyone they can. There’s nothing abt us that makes it happen.

<|startoftext|>Women are the most hated &amp; reviled humans on the planet; so much so it largely goes unnoticed and is widely accepted.

<|startoftext|>@ptsdandillness The whole world all at once is in trauma. Understandably so. 💕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone is waking up to these realities now. You know like seeing that things people thought were “okay” were in fact really off the mark and harming to people these actions are carried out on. Remember they used to think the earth was flat; humans are evolving<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CJ_isnowblue @RebeccaMcNutt2 Let’s not use a perfectly good female name as a derogatory name to minimize women. Aside from that no this is not the definition of a “karen”: they support tRump!! 😂 and are anti maskers and anti #BLM I say: GOOD JOB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@romyreiner Indeed. That and a sociopath of which he and she both are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrGJackBrown Hmm. Interestong and really a great question. Except most of the NRA love the tRump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BandyXLee1 You Mary Trump and millions of others around th evolve concurr that tRump in mentally incapable and has committed murders and much much more henious criminal and unethical harmful  and hateful actions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sociopaths &amp; psychopaths are the same thing; medically known as antisocial psychopaths. Many people dont realize the person they think of as a narcissist is in fact an antisocial psychopath. So decoding the person from that point of view reveals all. Nothing more simple than that<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NSurvivor @FreedomProgramm 👍🏼A sociopath and a psychopath are the same thing fundamentals most of what people think of as a narcissist are actuall at sociopaths/psychopaths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marge_mariotti @DetroitSteel_ Not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DetroitSteel_ I can see this will not work by your photo with her in your Twitter. She is real. Going back together and “it felt like nothing had ever happened” is not real.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NSurvivor @FreedomProgramm 😳 😳 I have UK clients with children of sociopaths. Agencies do try to keep the sociopath parent in the child’s life. If you get in the system you may never get out. They cling to harassing you into maintaining contact and have no clue abt sociopaths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nyccookies Naturally: any sociopath<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden All we needed was that last sentence. Skip talking about this sociopath in big-boy-pants<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amy_Siskind It does change things. This is good. The more who pull away from him the better. Is this not so? #dumptrump #boycottbriefings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Enough of psychopath rule. See them. Accept that they are real. Know our goodness holds more influence and power. See them. This diminishes them. This reduces their harm and ability to make use of others at their will.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@betrayed_h You want to see it for what it is: a situation which you are not in a mutual relationship but a circumstance of deception so that he could do whatever he wants. That’s all they ever want and it is exactly what they do: whatever they want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1980Dorothy If it’s getting worse you’re allergic.  https://t.co/9e0exZA5Zu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden No he does not. But JOE. PLEASE STOP TLAKING ABOUT tRump!!!!! We all know he’s an idiot. Are you trying to win only by presenting yourself as “not an idiot???? What is your platform besides him being bad and so by implication you must be good...!?!?!?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@narcbehavior We already have boundaries. Sociopaths don’t heed boundaries. No contact is the strongest message we can send and the beginning of breaking free and restoring ur life. We end it; they do not... why would they?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amy_Siskind #boycottbriefings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ADivorcing The most significant factor in winning is found in truly truly truly profoundly understanding the sociopath brain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ADivorcing You need to know what you want. What you feel winning in this madness is for you. And be determined you will get that no matter how things look. U must gather evidence if needed for the attorney they don’t go find that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ADivorcing Yes: only communicate to him via your attorney. This will be legal I for only and only from your attorney. You attorney will take steps u will not have known are options such as filing continuances and other legal procedure. The place we really win tho is outside court.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ADivorcing They aren’t after “drama”. They’re after getting whatever they want and not being stopped. In divorce their fear is being exposed as pathological users so that it intferes with getting and doing what they want which requires looking like the good guy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BibianTroice @truelovescam They also now at this time do not follow or regard covid precautions. They can’t really relate to things in real life: as we see tRump not doing. It’s likely his advisers and others around him who administer covid tests on him daily (if that’s true) just as he has secret service<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@narcsupport101 That’s also fundamentally the only reasons they ever speak from the very first hello.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@narcsupport101 To monitor the level of threat we are to them. And to see if they can get more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrOlmos 💕💕💕💕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@narcsupport101 They do eventually stop doing that. It is for two reasons and two reasons only. When those reasosns are satisfied or answered they stop.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@grow_your_wings @narcabuserehab Until there’s a real and true full recovery : which means a profound understanding of what a sociopath is, sociopaths will be who find us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drjerry65 @BeckyAwsum 😂 😂 Worse actually. He looks like his face is melting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EileenO @BeckyAwsum Goof gravy donald tRump is so so ugly. There is no category of human to put him in. Just monster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeckyAwsum Those are on no way the same color, but the yellowish one on McConnel is quite unattractive and ill fitting<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> https://t.co/TWzzwEPffz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peaceblitz There are sociopaths everywhere. Many exist in the “help”, “support” or “educator” or “advocate” realm of the aftermath of coercive control. I have a set of well-known narcissistic abuse gurus who r sociopaths themselves reported to me by clients. One of them female &amp; 3 white men<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They are not jealous of us. They don’t want to be us. They don’t need our energy. A sociopath wants two things: to do whatever they want and not be stopped. Their awareness, focus &amp; motivation comes from and is entirely about themselves. They do not understand our world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PTSD isn’t permanent. It might surprise some of us that the range of swinging emotions, and thoughts you’re going through are PTSD; the terror, numbness, all the weeping is post-traumatic stress, swinging through a jungle of cognitive dissonance, shock, and more shock.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reluctant Virgin: Some sociopaths claim sexual inexperience or innocence or religious beliefs to keep from having sex. This can be a great ploy for the female sociopath to entice prey into a marriage with a “virgin bride”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are not discarded. Or devalued tho u felt that it’s not what is happening. They are bailing because the scam failed. They need to spin fast to create the impression that you’re bad &amp; they’re good &amp; monitor you &amp; others to make sure they’re safe. And 2 see if they can get more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimeToRecover74 It’s not you being “discarded” - tho u felt that it’s not what is happening. They are bailing because the scam failed. They need to spin fast to create the impression that you’re bad &amp; they’re good &amp; monitor you &amp; others to make sure they’re safe. And 2 see if they can get more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sociopathlover Some are “dumb” and others are sociopaths and others are fantastic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Breakingfreetwo Oh but we can understand it all— better than most. Being an empath doesn’t have to be exhausting or a weakness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@btsy7 Good gravy. No.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pebbles_70_ 😂 good observation!!! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sociopaths’ sexual traits are hard to fathom. The matrix of any normal romantic relationship is the physical expression of love. The thing is, in these situations, from their side of it, love’s got nothing to do with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackDerecho It’s all on them. We feel confused and gaslit. They have a simple goal: to take and make use of and not be stopped. And they do and say anything to make that happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Deegan102 @Jaymie65195962 Because donald tRump is a sociopath<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffersonandCo @LynnRotenberry @IHaveVanished Oh my gosh!!! 😢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It can seem past abuse leads narcs to us. That’s the paradigm &amp; general belief out &amp; about. I gauruntee that’s not WHY it happened. It happens because sociopaths exist. In my six years w/clients the ones who know somethings wrong earliest one r ppl who kno dysfunction previously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@p_alenz Congratulations!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@narcabuserehab Amber. I know people who know people. 2 degrees of separation from the sitch.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Take in the perspective and skills to fully and profoundly understand what this all is.  https://t.co/DS0uKwBLWM  https://t.co/OVo5xYNdBi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JulieLevineArt They don’t have conversations at all. And they only speak in direct need as they perceive it related to doing and taking what they want and not being stopped<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dlhampton Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robreiner Yes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robreiner It’s not up to god. It’s up to us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NancyNapAuthor No on can understand this unless they’ve been in it; even that isn’t a guarantee of truly understanding it. Ppl around us won’t get it. Some will mean well. Some not. And usually best not to tell them abt it. That’s what guided recovery sessions w/ me are for! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 Real freedom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JulieLevineArt Some do, some don’t. Childhood abuse does not lead to adult abusive situations necessarily. In my clints I’ve seen that abuse in childhood make sppl@much more aware of bad dynamics and able to exit bad situations earlier esp cases of benign ensnared by coercive control.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dlhampton 👍🏼Doesn’t seem so surprising... everything is in our cells, and hormones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenJeffMerkley @SophiaWentBlue What has happened to this young man they kidnapped?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenJeffMerkley @SophiaWentBlue We must stop these maniacs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@duty2warn Oh his word was to attempt to not allow it to be published. That pretty much gives the stamp of truth to the book. Truth he doesn’t want told.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmotionalRobot1 Exactly... !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every scam ends. This is why they have many prey at once. A roster of in &amp; out crossover fluctuating prey. Like a vending machine. Role: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I J from respectability-facade-provider to party-piece, to hide-out, money-bags etc &amp; refills right behind each flavor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LauryneWright He knows he’s a white man and he believes that means he’s better and the boss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hopmar3 @essenviews Of course he lies for “pleasure”. Like any sociopath they can’t NOT lie. This is how their brains work. Their only concern is doing whatever they want, taking, and making use of others and not being stopped. They are pure evil and destruction<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@essenviews 😂 😂 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN Ridiculous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PositiveReframe And praise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Narcissistic sociopaths are notorious talkers. When the mood strikes them they yip and yap away – sometimes for hours at a time. They tell stories, entertaining, dropping bombs, and leaving us scratching our heads. They tell stories for three reasons.  https://t.co/gnLUiuXiUw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Carolin48265639 Wrong. You were never evil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robreiner We knew that. She calls him a malignant narcissist ... He is an antisocial psychopath a sociopath/psychopath<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NPDsurvivors @AlisonB12244537 It doesn’t take two. These are instantaneous hypnotic entrapments. THAT is coercive control. It happens at “hello”.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CNN Hopefully this dog has been put down<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheNarcExposed Yes ... sociopaths/psychopaths are 100% devoid of hamnity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@narcbehavior That’s a sociopath. And the ya re crimes rather than relationships. The sociopath knows this. They aren’t “breaking up” they’re done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robreiner Before giving him the data from doctors and hospitals on Covid19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peaceblitz A sociopath. Not a “malignant narcissist”.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheNarcExposed That’s a sociopath who needs others to prey upon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fras99 She was immediately under the spell of coercive control as happens to any of us ensnared by a sociopath. We think it’s love; it isn’t. Melanie at this point clearly hates him. She is not free to leave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmotionalRobot1 @IselaBlancAZ Have you investigated because basic contract law is usually more on the side of the lessor/tenant than the landlord in most things. Raising rent though is a city or county ruling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marie_skou @narcabuserehab That depends on the circumstances and when you speak and why and where.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IselaBlancAZ It’s up to us, that’s what this revolutionary time is all about; stand up and create for a humanistic world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IselaBlancAZ Yep. I know. I live in LA. It’s really really really bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheNarcExposed That is not why they’re believable and they are horrible at lying. Their believability is not there because they’re “good at it”. (It’s due to 2 other factors) In fact they’re terrible at it or none of us would be here talking about it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lacadri34 Best be glad for Fauci!! He’s braving it out int he it house to give us as much as he can<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sociopaths -&amp; what u might be calling a Narc, narcissist or sociopath- know they lie. They don’t think it’s bad that they lie. For them reality is made up and lies are real. It’s flexible and as required in any one moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN Nothing new from the sociopath pretending to be president<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheNarcExposed That’s a sociopath. And they know they lie. They don’t think it’s bad that they lie. For them reality is made up and lies are real. It’s flexible and as required in any one moment.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Lulu4Ukon So so so sorry for your loss. Beyond words.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmotionalRobot1 @IselaBlancAZ Any rents can be raised at any time by owners unless your county or state or city has rent control policies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IselaBlancAZ One bedroom one bathroom in LA is lowest about $1800. Housing is HORRIFIC. There is now rent control of 5% or 10% increase per year across CA (can’t recall which).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fras99 Something I would not watch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We tend to think everything they say is a lie. When they tell the truth we don’t usually recognize it because it’s expressing something outside our realm of what reality could be. Everything about them is fraud. So unless we’ve got proof...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TLCCampy96 That would be a sociopath... And close to everything they say is a lie. When they tell the truth we don’t usually recognize it because it’s expressing something outside our realm of what reality could be. Everything about them is fraud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SayNo2Narcs @YouTube @hario42 Yah these are sociopaths. And they go away when we go no contact. Then recovery starts... We always loved ourselves.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@robreiner 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@stayceespeaks 😂 😂 You’re hilarious and I so agree with you! They are absolute bonkers and follow the ravings of a sociopath who is dumber than a box of rocks (as every sociopath is).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@peaceblitz Nope you are not. There are MANY people who do it all solo. It’s ignored as a demographic and not at all catered to in advertising or considered  much at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TracyK199 @Lyricathy @mryj1203 @JoJoFromJerz @JoeBiden Very working. Science and common sense support wearing a mask. Is masks are not effective in protecting from and preventing spread of disease why would medical docs have worn them since hundreds of years ago?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@h_gossett It was a really big fire from what I understand. A good fire. I don’t know. I wasn’t there. Could be one of those smoke signal things got outta hand.

<|startoftext|>@HazelBazel8 @rickygervais The ability to “buy an island” has nothing to do with not liking leaf blowers: they are annoying beyond belief and accomplish nothing but move dirt from one place to a few feet away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kirstywoods @rickygervais Leaf blowers BLOW the leaves and dirt... everywhere onto everything. Shifting dirt and twigs and yuck from one spot to another and into your windows into your house and onto you car.... they don’t suck them up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarkPhoenix1967 Yep. Sociopaths don’t wear condoms aside from very rare instances or occurances. This is a typical of and a consistent sexual trait of male sociopaths.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BobSachemano @TDayShark Uh. Really. There was indeed sanctioned torture and cruel brutal death for criminals and etc. Being nailed to and hanging from a cross was a death sentence for criminals. They considered Jesus a criminal because he was an activist speaking out for humanity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TLCCampy96 An escape from a sociopath isn’t best or most effectively or thrououghly handled by traditional counseling or therapy in which the problem is assigned to the targeted prey as codependent, low self esteem, w/out boundaries or due to childhood or past occirances.

<|startoftext|>@kurteichenwald He’s medically known as what is an antisocial psychopath. Parts of their brains don’t function. They cannot comprehend the real world. They make things up.

<|startoftext|>@peaceblitz All of us can have good fortune or maybe you call it luck. 💕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mator06 @WeAre__Warriors All becomes easier when we get to understanding the simplistic basics of the sociopath brain. We are the ones with the power. Once we flip that table every things shifts and falls into place - not to say this isn’t the hardest thing any of us will ever do.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ProjectLincoln She is so dumb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ADivorcing There’s a way to decipher what happens that releases the memories and pain. And it makes us more US. And is freedom 💕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SoulFreeing1111 I LOVE Weleda. It’s available on Amazon or Whole Foods. A German natural face cream and etc company. I use the Calendula babies face cream on my face and Skin Food and any of them.  https://t.co/v5YXsPElF1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ADivorcing That’s what I guide people to do in sessions. It’s somehow what I did instinctively! So fortunate in that!When we know their motivation for the stark reality it is, realize amazing true facts abt being normal then we can resolve because it’s from a point of truth vs. not truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ADivorcing I so get it! I’m so sorry a monster invaded your lives with deception and his own agenda to make use of you. The memories are though- believe it or not- the material we transmute to resolve the loss, and restore our lives. When seen for what they really were we can then heal.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TownPunnetts @s9tmt @HelenBa16838378 @faisalislam That then is a sociopath.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robreiner Great question. And just btw: sociopaths do often tell the truth. It’s when they say bizarre things that make our head spin rather than the things they say that we clearly see as a lie such as this about Putin. U mitght like my website for more abt these creatures.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robreiner He’s a racist and mush more that is also pure evil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marie_skou Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CannabisCommen1 @LexLuthier34 I also have been out four times since March 9th. Each time with a mask. This is the way the world will be until here is a vaccine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheNarcExposed @abuse_strong Sociopaths... worse. And many people thought to be “narcissists” are sociopaths. Worth looking in to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Weathermetre @LexLuthier34 There’s nothing heartless about protecting the mask wearer and ppl around them from covid. It’s simple: wear a mask or stay home. Those are the only options.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kristen_lindop @LexLuthier34 Yes of course it protects you too! I wear a mask if I go out to protect myself: It’s not just for other people.If masks didn’t protect the wearer docs and nurses etc would not have begun wearing them literally hundreds of years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CJartisan @LexLuthier34 @ruthmkb The plain blue surgical masks work best for me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iv_coffee_stat @LexLuthier34 And you wear them to protect your own health correct? Ppl seem to think wearing a mask now is solely to “protect others”. It’s not just for other people. If masks didn’t protect the wearer docs and nurses etc would not have begun wearing them literally hundreds of years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanLacelle @LexLuthier34 That’s right. I live in Los Angeles. It is NUTS here; can’t begin to imagine Florida and other such states<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SandyNeverFord @LexLuthier34 That’s a shame. I would not work in a place that did not require customers to wear masks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanadianDivaDi @LexLuthier34 It’s not just for other people. Masks keep us from absorbing others “breath” ie: droplets. If masks didn’t protect the wearer docs and nurses etc would not have begun wearing them literally hundreds of years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pugsley_maddams @LexLuthier34 Then they need to stay home in order to protect themsleves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RebSal @LexLuthier34 @CailinasEirinn Different fabric. I find woven cloth more sturdy than the premade blue surgical masks. A bandana is also less protection.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tamsmcco @LexLuthier34 Exactly. If you care about yourself, you ear at a mask. If you care about others, you wear a mask.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cherylmcl57 @LexLuthier34 You might just need to stay home.<|endoftext|>
