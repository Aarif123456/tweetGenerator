<|startoftext|>@spread_we @caffeine_adct How do you make the difference between a protester and a rioter?  In the lawless streets, right now, rioters are hiding behind the mask of protesters and perhaps, some protesters are hiding a future rioter, who knows?

<|startoftext|>@DMorgan913 @Multi_Path_Fade @Lrihendry … so should #Trump campaign as an #Independent in 2020?  Only as a threat, of course…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DMorgan913 @Multi_Path_Fade @Lrihendry Nobody wanted to have the "proof"! The DNC server (&amp; Clintons' computers) were hacked  and the contents widely available in 2016 alreadyto anyone who wanted to know…  … but it's too damaging to #DNC &amp; #Obama, &amp; #RNC, &amp; much more… So, expect investigations to go on forever! …<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Good!… but how many more crocodiles in this political swamp?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TobyRKnottTobey Yes, you're right! But today's politics are so stressful, chaotic and unpredictable, one can expect anything to happen… Only 34 days to go!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>… in short: «Former President #JacquesChirac was a political chameleon…» PARIS (Reuters)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When #France had to vote on a new constitution for Europe, #Chirac didn't campaign for it convincingly &amp; it lost, presaging the difficulties #EU would face in later years:  His vision was not for a "United States of Europe", but a "United Europe of Nations", whatever it means! …<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Femi_Sorry "Do all Brexit voters want No-Deal? No?"  Ok, but does anybody know what a #BrexitDeal is about?  Ask Santa and perhaps you'll have a deal for Xmas; but don't ask #Brussels, you are punished anyway, bad guys!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's all about #impeachment: #Dems' psychosis! Confusion, difficulty thinking and understanding, disorientation, false belief of superiority, memory loss, belief that an ordinary event has special and personal meaning, belief that thoughts aren't one's own, thought disorder, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson Yes, it is time to dare and endure, Boris: 37 days to go!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill Wow so much information! We'll need time to digest all this… #Macron lecturing …<|endoftext|>
