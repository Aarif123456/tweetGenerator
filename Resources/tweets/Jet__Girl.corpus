<|startoftext|>@defenselessftdt Hey, grab some ice and rub it where you want to do it. Don't do anything to hurt yourself. Put gloves on and scratch. Try to calm down, wash your face, scream into a pillow if you need to. Turn on music and the TV and if there's someone home go talk to them about whatever.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@corpseewhore Bohemian Rhapsody? The song from Wayne's world? That's from Queen. You know We are the champions for sure. Listen to their greatest hits on Spotify and you will realise you have heard the songs a lot of times and you just didn't know who performed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@itsme_clarah Todos estes designs são tão superiores comparados com a nova merch... Eles têm de contratar você e despedir quem quer que seja que desenhou uma Mão com calças.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hopeworlouist E é aí que o nome da Malikinha é revelado! Uma foto perto da àrvore de natal e nós vamos ver uma prenda com uma etiqueta com o nome dela.  Ok, provavelmente não vai acontecer, mas eu posso sonhar.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@perfectlou91 It's like someone was drunk and doodling on a napkin on some bar and was like " this is the shit!!!".  But then turns out the "the" should not be in the sentence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@perfectlou91 He's rich af. He doesn't need to sell out every single item on his merch store.  He is also a fashion icon. And I think he would not wear these ugly designs. I doubt he even saw it.   He needs to be more involved on the merch design process.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@perfectlou91 I don't think anyone would actually want it. At least I wouldn't.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ieva_lieva There's no way Harry has any say on his merch. This is worst than #Twentyonepilots Amazon merch, which is only ugly. This new merch is ugly AND dumb.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Harry_Styles You should organise a competition where people submit their designs for merch and then YOU, not your management ( no offense), can pick the top 10 and those designs would be manufactured.  It inspires creativity, and I bet it looks better than a hand with pants.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MYTWOLARRY Hi.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lokiattme I'm so confused.  https://t.co/2R8NspkVSh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanyonMoonJen You need to make some noise.  I know Harry isn't on social media much but he should be more involved when it comes to this kind of stuff.   After waiting so long they should include a personal note written by Harry, and a coupon or free credit for you to spend in the store.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanyonMoonJen I think he should check it out before they start making it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanyonMoonJen Harry should come up with a competition where people would submit their designs for merch and then HARRY, not the management, would pick like the top 10 and those designs would be manufactured.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanyonMoonJen Hahahaha the firefighters would be like " oh... Leave that one for the end, save the other people first" lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanyonMoonJen 5 months?! Are they being manufactured in the moon?  See, this is something I think Harry should be more involved in.    Louis, for example, is so thoughtful with his merch. Someone says there's a problem with shipping he fixes it. People wanted bucket hats, they got the hats...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanyonMoonJen I would only wear that if I was paid too.  He always looks so good and we're supposed to look like idiots?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Harry_Styles you are a fashion icon, so why is your merch so fugly? Seriously! A hand with pants? What's next? A foot with a blouse?  Sincerely,  someone who can't afford your merch but wants her less broke friends to look good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HSHQ Look, I love Harry, I do, but what the fuck is this tomfoolery?!  https://t.co/dZ8WHKAJxP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanyonMoonJen It's a hand with pants... WTF? And the quality? Just like a sticker that has been on someone's bedroom window since the 90s.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@perfectlou91 The first time I listened to it I sobbed. I looked like I had just seen a puppy getting hit by a car. I think it's my favorite Louis' song.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adoreyoufishy Hi!!! You know what my Christmas tree is lacking? Presents. And I have 3 cats so without presents they hang under the tree and play with ornaments and end up pushing the tree to the ground. If there were some presents there that would not happen...

<|startoftext|>Just because I'm not screaming " oh my god he was brilliant, harry forever" it doesn't mean I'm not a fan. Chill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last night I said Harry looked tired and didn't smile much but I wasn't hating on him. I didn't even watch from the beginning. I was just expecting it to be more "Joly". He sounded amazing. The band sounded very good. It's a shame it wasn't as Christmas-y but I still loved it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was late, so besides watermelon sugar and golden, what else did #HarryStyles sing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hsftheaven He sounded beautiful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Death penalty should only be considered if someone is particularly evil. Like pedophiles who molested a 2 year old. Or a particularly nasty and vicious serial killer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Harry's #jingleball2020 was not very Christmas-y.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Frodo: [of Gollum] It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he had the chance.  Gandalf: Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand. Many that live deserve death. Some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them, Frodo? Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Billie Eilish sounds amazing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm just going to say this quickly, but Harry didn't look very happy. I don't know if it was because he was tired, but he needs to enjoy himself more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know how to really express myself. #BrandonBernard did not deserve to die. In no way possible. It's revolting. Heartbreaking.  May he rest in peace. And let us never be at peace with what happened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course I heard the alarm. ignored it. Then I remembered why I set it but then it was late and I only watched Golden and watermelon sugar. #jingleball2020  #HarryStyles<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sunflwrcliffo "Saint Nikolas soon arrives" it kills me every time.   The whole thing is priceless. I love it so much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sunflwrcliffo This is my all time favorite video.  The whole thing is iconic.   Psychiatrists should recommend this damn video to help cute depression.   Disney/Pixar need to call Niall the next time they need a voice actor for one of their movies.  I genuinely love it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@foolsgoldwalls The song kinda sounds like a "how to write a song with basic rhymes". So no, I never actually paid attention. Next time I will.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EmpireofCabello Niall in his natural habitat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmpireofCabello Niall had such a skinny waist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmpireofCabello Niall looks seven. Harry looks seven and a half.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@habitinred Awwww<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I kinda love the third one. I wish I could buy it and give it to my mom, but then she would probably throw the pieces at my head.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wallsandghosts Hahahahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MYTWOLARRY He wasn't eating, he looked exhausted... Leaving the band probably saved his life. And that's obviously not a dig at the other boys. He wasn't making the music he wanted to make and their work hours were insane. I get tired just thinking about it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HlPPIECAS This one is so funny. Or he'd say " so now that you need me you suddenly remember I exist?!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HlPPIECAS If it was god, he would either just snap his fingers and you would no longer have a period or he would not a shit. If it was the actual chuck Shirley he would either be too nervous to ask for the details or not answer because he was drunk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HlPPIECAS LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sundriedtommo He either doesn't need to answer cause he already knows the specifics or he gets home without buying any and gets kicked in the balls.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@alizaxgolden You are either in space or in a boat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lostaircatcher Or the way that the trailer showed us the best fighting sequence ever, with them showing their amazing powers but then it didn't actually happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DARLINGL0U At first I thought it was a belt. But then I look down and he is already wearing a belt, a belt that is not doing its job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rotgnaw296 @corpseewhore Nah. You forgot feeling cold, being lazy...I don't have it and sometimes I procrastinate so much that when I get to the bathroom the pee doesn't even come out right way, it takes a while because my bladder is probably not relaxed enough since I was holding it for so long.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taronenthusiast Hahaha so accurate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alizaxgolden I would not wear any of those outfits but if I had to it would probably be Harry because he has three layers and I get cold easily. Plus I like his sneakers but my favorite sweater is Niall's.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alizaxgolden The street looks fairly empty so imagine if they made them be outside at 5am just so they don't get mobbed lol Zayn sure looks like he hasn't woken up yet.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@scrptedwalls @hippieangeI Not bigger, but his boobs do the bra thing without the bra. Like staying in place for example.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@corpseewhore Basically he was an artist with a very soothing voice who taught tutorials on how to paint, and everyone loves him because he was so chill and so kind  hearted and pretty much amazing at art and he was essentially able to make the worst of artists create something beautiful.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@taronenthusiast @honkycataron @goldenegerton Honestly? Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@buckleysstark I'd be happy enough if I could just hang out with Christopher and be his tutor or babysitter and see these two occasionally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel like I have the life experience of a 14 year old. Or considering how 14 year olds look and act nowadays, probably not even that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@91HSLOT But online you kind of exude this vibe of actually being pretty cool but not in an unapproachable way. More like you know what you want and aren't afraid to say it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@91HSLOT If you meet someone and they are really cool it immediately feels like they have everything figured out and that you will never be close because they are so "much better" than you are. It feels like "oh I'm nowhere cool enough to hang out with that person. I'm too boring".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@91HSLOT At one point in time I actually had friends, and I was social and liked spending time with people but I think that was just the giddy effects of some antidepressants and once my body and mind got used to it things got very gloomy and antisocial very quickly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@91HSLOT That's exactly what I do as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@91HSLOT Well, it's 2020 so it's not like there is much to do.  I think one of the problems is not social distance it's just distance distance because the people who like the same things as me or think like me are a billion miles away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@91HSLOT Actually being awkward kinda adds this charming quality to people. And it makes them more approachable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@91HSLOT Everyone is kinda awkward. If someone isn't awkward it's because they are faking until they make it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@91HSLOT What stuff do you like to do?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TinPrints I can't. I don't have a friend. The keychains would both be for me and that's just sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@91HSLOT I don't know if I would or not. But knowing myself we would probably not be friends but it would be my fault lol<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tarondancer The first picture is Taron as Count Olaf hahahahaha  https://t.co/I5VO89fI1Y<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ENBYLWT @hopeIjp It was so respectful. He mentioned the band but he put the emphasis on the solo artist. Which is how it should be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ENBYLWT @hopeIjp Yes!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FilmUpdates The real scary story is that Netflix cancels this but renews Riverdale.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realdailypayne @hopeIjp @scott_mills @Chris_Stark @BBCR1 He is not an ordinary guy. He is too talented at everything to be an ordinary guy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lokiattme @LiamPayne I'm shit at running anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cherrykiwihigh @ellexlucozade No, it's right at the same time. Every place on earth is now named Liam Payne.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cherrykiwihigh @S0URD1ESEL27 Hahahaha denomination.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My letter to 10 year old me: you think this is bad? It gets worse. Then better, then worse, then better, then worse, then better and then permanently worse. Give up while you are ahead. Wait, you are not ahead. Just give up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheHVL @fuckingavacados @Louis_Tomlinson Oh wait, that was yesterday. Today is the 3rd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheHVL @Louis_Tomlinson Oh today is break my fucking heart into a million pieces day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dark1Pilots @Happyanfii When you are short you can't reach the shelves in the store. All the pants you try on and buy? They are always super long. You gotta hem them or fold them. Oversized shirts become too short dresses. You gain 1 kg? It's immediately noticeable.  Be happy you're not short.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dark1Pilots Every time someone mentions their height all I remember is this lol And if he actually was that short, he would still be taller than me.  https://t.co/0I4DZtFjXC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>How in the fuck?!  https://t.co/EbSHMHFiSz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@awmalfoys @prfctmxxnlight He looks 15 now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fuckingpardon Wtf he looked 9.  Actually, he probably still looks 9 nowadays.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@honkycataron He needs more work and publicity, and interviews and to post stuff online. Without content there is nothing to talk about. We can't just pull content out of a top hat. Only bunnies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fuckingavacados I wonder if he has cooked anything since then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Age of Ultron fucked up so many things in the MCU, they should just erase that movie from existence. No Hawkeye with a secret family, no waste in using James Spader as a voice only villain, no dead Pietro, Jarvis would still exist...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He hasn't been accused of pulling a gun on his wife or ex wife, or what not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #TaronEgerton became part of the MCU he would be great as Human Torch or, in my opinion, even better as iceman. He has the sass, he has the looks.  But you know what? He should have beeb new Hawkeye ( new Clint). He is actually a great bowman, he is fit, he is blonde...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need to spend more time offline because I easily fixate on things, books, musicians, movies etc, and since I have no real life I become conditioned to only caring about those things or those things become the only things that give me joy, and by association, also sadness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hbwwxlls Having talent can really change your life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hbwwxlls My heart<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@malikinhaxs He proved he is perfect. Again.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realdailypayne @LiamPayne @BBCR1 And I'm crying again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realdailypayne @LiamPayne @BBCR1 Shit, he really met his baby's momma at 14. Damn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@louismyhabittt You have great taste!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got the letter R.  Reply with "." And I'll give you a letter.  https://t.co/Cj2SKx1XmX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyporfavor I didn't even think that, my brain just went "He's dead!!!!". I can overreact sometimes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm just waiting for the rest of the fans to either wake up or get out of work/school for twitter to implode with the perfection that was #LiamPayne letter to his 10 year old self.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@louismyhabittt .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@esnyvolsix Everyone who wasn't on his lane... They're going to violently swerve into his lane once they hear the damn letter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lokiattme Boy band that gets big. Really big. As in the biggest boyband in history. They break up. Depression. He releases great music solo. He has a kid but he and his wife get a divorce.  2020 hits. Liam gets engaged and becomes the only person whose hair got ten times better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lokiattme He is so down to earth. And his life... A lot of ups and downs but it always ends up okay. Kidney is fucked up but later he almost becomes an Olympian. Is bullied in school but learns boxing. Goes to XFactor, doesn't go to the live shows But comes back and ends up in a 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@esnyvolsix BBC needs to send us free tissues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Story of my Life!!!!!  Yeah, #BBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just saying, be if I wrote a letter to my 10 year old self, I'd end up so depressed I may as well just puty shoes on and go jump off a bridge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fml, #LiamPayne is goddamn amazing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why am I crying? Oh man he just talked about Bear. #LiamPayne<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh man. I'm smiling so big.  #LiamPayne This letter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@esnyvolsix Exactly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course he was almost and Olympian. Of course. He doesn't know how to be less than perfect. #LiamPayne<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Probably a bit smelly".  Oh Liam lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Liam is on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lokiattme Compared to me? Humongous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lokiattme Me irl because I have no friends:  https://t.co/mfh3kNDi0w<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Liam Payne next".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to be honest, besides golden, I'm just sitting here listening to music I really don't like. Hurry up #BBC!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lokiattme Same. That's how you mention the band but focus more on the solo artist. Easy peasy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lokiattme 6 minutes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lokiattme The most radio I've listened to in the past decade. I'm curious to know what Liam wrote. I mean, we know it's going to be perfect because it appears he is good at everything he does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClassicXbooks Sounds... Intriguing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also did you notice how #Golden was the first song played in this segment of #BBC sounds radio?  And Nick Grimshaw is going on at 15:30 with "Going Home Anthems".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My tl " spare 20" "spare 30"... Well Spare Me anyone, 1, 2 it doesn't matter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Waiting for #LiamPayne's letter to his 10 year old self on #BBC radio And now I'm just wondering who the hell #Craig from Longsomething is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lokiattme  https://t.co/tf75ZnatQD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@INZAYNFLAM3S Right answer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shunthedaylight @SigmaGlitch Awww the kid looks adorable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harryslyricbot @habitinred My depression: easy for you to say, you beautiful, talented, rich bastard. Me: omg I didn't mean that. My brain: yes you did. Except the bastard part. My depression: *sings*"we gotta get awayyyy*cries* from he he heee heeree".<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@INZAYNFLAM3S I mean at least if you are Eleanor for a day there's a chance you will get to hang out with Louis. A very small chance but a chance nonetheless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@liamjpvids @hopeIjp Cute as a kitten.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nbtemptyou Taron Egerton is a much good looking girl than me, an actual girl -.-<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Talks about everything and their wonderful lives and then ask me about my cats, smile like I was a little kid on America's got talent that sang really bad but no one wants to tell them that, and don't say anything else to me.  Hell yeah to staying home!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing like the holidays to remember how you can't buy shit for your family/friends and how much a disappointment you are to everyone even if they don't say it out loud. I'm glad we're in quarantine. That way there won't be a family reunion and shit, where everyone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lovefaithharry Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TinPrints You guys are fast!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@catsnoplace He's so smart he already finished his exam and the teacher told him he could nap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every time I see a Vogue magazine "unworthy! You aren't the one that I want!" Because of course none of them are the one with Harry on the cover.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel so betrayed when I write "Harry" and the predictive text shows Potter as a suggestion instead of Styles.  I spend so much time on my damn phone and this piece of shit hasn't learned anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nbtemptyou Holy crap!  Beautiful!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rememberliiam @1DtHaiSs Eu adoro essa foto do Louis. É a minha foto favorita dele.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@REGlONALATWORST I'm a 5'2" white girl... If I introduce myself as Gangsta's Paradise I'm either gonna get beat up or just die from embarrassment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@malikinhaxs In a way he is a bit wrong I can't wear what I like. It either doesn't fit or it's too expensive! lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@love4braves I don't think so. She is just incredibly stupid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@love4braves You to she who shall not be named:  https://t.co/lUwmvD2pB3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CURLYCUNT_ @malikinhaxs My reaction: *Inhales very loudly*<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealCandaceO ( suggestion to all of you: actually do that lol)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@esnyvolsix Idk if I should laugh at her stupidity or cry because I wasted important seconds of my life focused on that woman.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealCandaceO @FrangellBasora @Harry_Styles @edwardxrami @ChristianWalk1r That moment when you realise someone managed to say something even more idiotic than all the crap Trump says.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPIDEYXPOOL Most of the times my favorites are dead, dying, sick or hurt.   Or even worse. They are a background character with very few lines.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taronenthusiast Yes he is.   In real life Reggie ended up confessing he murdered Teddy and I was so offended like " why? He is so lovely, Taron did a good job..." And then I remembered " wait a second. This is about real people not fictional characters. Stop being a dumbass".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OTBRAVEL0U @ILLICITLINES @IMPRINTCLOUDS Here they didn't have flicker, self titled or mind of mine, but they had the others. Walls? Nothing. Oh and all the 1d albums were on sale lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goIdntemptress @WALLSUPREM4CY I had to read the comments to know what the fuck you were talking about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HESOG0LDEN I think it's more to correct Variety's wrong assumption than proving he is successful.  That being said, Harry is the one I listen to the most, because I like his music more. It's simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hesbennipi lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@onedporfavor Todos ele são. Mas uma coisa é ser famoso e outra coisa é continuar famoso. E isso é algo que todos conseguiram manter. A única razão pela qual o Harry aparenta ter mais sucesso neste momento é porque para além da música, ele tb é actor e está fortemente associado a moda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Proud of all 5. But stream walls to slap #Variety in the face.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goldensophs @lovefaithharry I'm dying here hahahahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KhameekJ03 It's not even a fair fight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MYTWOLARRY Louis is very successful!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tarondancer Diego &amp; Five/ o filme favorito é Rocketman mas as minhas personagens favoritas são o Eddie the eagle e o Eggsy no primeiro Kingsman. Não sou muito fã do Kingsman Golden Circle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealCandaceO Don't you have a book to promote or something? Because I'm pretty sure if a Harry fan sees your work on a book store they are going to grab it and hide it behind the least popular books on the store.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealCandaceO Baby momma my ass.  https://t.co/bIjpCwjFoU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tarondancer Personagem favorita de TUA? Filme favorito do Taron?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so close to getting Spotify premium just for the fact that everytime I want to listen to #Rocketman's soundtrack it plays two songs and then it skips to some other song from some other musical that I never even listened to. Why Spotify? Why are you so bitchy?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tarondancer Sim lol  Tudo bem ctg?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>a little bit more and so on until I finish it.  Yes, I am ripping the bandaid very slowly.  I don't know if I can watch the one about the spoiled billionaires because Kevin Spacey is in it and I like when I DON'T gag watching a movie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone says that Robin Hood is a terrible movie, but since #TaronEgerton is in it, I still want to watch it. I'm a huge fan of archery too. My favourite comic book characters are Clint and Kate! But I don't wanna cringe so I watched 10 minutes of the movie. Later I'll watch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tarondancer Adoro ambos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hsftheaven Hahahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CandaceOwens is like "I just won this race, look, the other competitors aren't even near me yet!!!"  She doesn't realize she is dead last and all the other runners aren't around because they already finished and went home.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@taygi_zouis @goldenswomanx @RealCandaceO @Harry_Styles  https://t.co/qdOi6XqTZB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealCandaceO @Harry_Styles So, next time she tries to communicate with the world let's just ignore her. It sounds like a good idea to let her just speak to her 3 and a half supporters until she is tired.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeeALoverr @RealCandaceO @Harry_Styles Global conversation. Yes. Sure. It doesn't mean they are talking about good things though.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Iouissunflowers @ILLICITLINES Because if he reads that and doesn't say "well that didn't need to be included" or " this is a bit offensive" then I'd be disappointed.   They could have just said that his ex band mates transitioned to solo music well too. Or maybe not mention 1d at all?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iouissunflowers @ILLICITLINES Exactly. But it looks like it's more  Management: " okay Harry, all finished, buh bye"  Later.  Management on the phone:" Yes, this is management. Oh Variety can write that bullshit. Of course he agrees... Well, We agree so it's like he also agrees, totally, absolutely mmm mmm"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Variety hey, great photos of Harry Styles.   Now please learn how to be polite towards other musicians coughlouistomlinsoncough. Plus you are interviewing a solo musician, why do you even have to mention his ex band mates?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ILLICITLINES @IMPRINTCLOUDS This really upset me. Yesterday I was checking out albums in the music store and they had Harry's, Niall's, Liam's and Zayn's. Louis' ??? Nope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iouissunflowers @ILLICITLINES Come on... Is he even allowed to read the final product before it's published??? Because he really should.  https://t.co/2nbJ56v9sr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClassicXbooks 3 or 4.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@91CAR0LlNA I like how you phrased the whole thing... Very profound at first and then "obv bananas are dicks". LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@91CAR0LlNA 2/2 with her mom and the earth Is warm and sunny, flowers bloom etc ( Spring and Summer) and on the other 6 months she be spends in the underground the earth is gloomy and cold, leaves fall and so does snow and what not, ( Fall and Winter).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@91CAR0LlNA Proserpina daughter of Ceres was taken by Pluto to the underworld. Some shit happened and it was like"if she hasn't eaten anything she can come back to earth. But she had already eaten a little bit of a pomegranate. Do they made a deal. She spends 6 months on earth with her 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TPWKYOLO Oh the color of the blouse is to die for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DRUNKLOU28 My right ear hurts a lot, I thought it was because of the cold when I went out yesterday but turns out it's your fault. If you scream that loud again you're gonna lose your voice!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fuckingavacados I love the outfit.  And the caption lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know what I miss? Harry Styles' pictures that aren't from fans, papparazi, strangers and photoshoots. Like selfies, or a picture he took that time he went some place, or a picture of him and friends eating dinner or something. You know, something natural.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@megalots13 His left hand... It's sweater paws but with a fancy coat and ruffles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those 83 new ones are probably just whatever genres #TwentyOnePilots consists of.  https://t.co/NoFNCkyQ8a<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is incorrect. I listened to #Sia's piano version of Elastic Heart at least as once a day, every single day ( except 3 days). And where is I'm Still Standing by #EltonJohn sang by #TaronEgerton? And #JakeShimabukuro ukulele cover of Bohemian Rhapsody???  https://t.co/aU9wxrkXmV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Top Artist? Probably. When you discover a new band you listen to all their music more than once.  But I am sure I listened to Nico and the Niners a lot more than truce, because Truce is depressing af and my mental health couldn't handle it anymore.  https://t.co/dePscYPXk9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Spotify thingy:  Wtf. I did? Oh it must be because of all the instrumentals of modern songs that I listened to.  https://t.co/PjG5WomHQI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Spotify thingy:   And by one direction they mean Wolves played a shit ton of times.  https://t.co/pkiCyVXMgp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realdailypayne @LiamPayne @WebSummit Liam is the human equivalent of a puppy. We don't deserve him. No one does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By #twentyonepilots  a lot. Maybe that's why I'm so depressed.   And wtf? How many genres of music is there? I bet all the new ones are just from #tøp  Well at least I don't leave Spotify on some eclectic music playlist and then mute it to seem likely I'm a music connoisseur.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"be seen" sang by Louis. It's my favorite thing ever.)  I lived on the moon is the only song by #Kwoon that I know. It's very relaxing.  Gangsta's Paradise the cover by #KinaGrannis? I wanted to memorize the lyrics without googling them. It took a while.  I listened to Truce<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just some notes: I'm pretty sure the actual song I listen to the most was the piano version of Elastic Heart by #Sia. I listen to it at least once a day every day. The podcasts? LOL Top artists: 4. #OneDirection ( cough cough wolves on repeat. And if I could fly, because of the<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me: my favorite band is Bright Eyes.  Spotify: sure. That's why none of their song are in your top stats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ftdtpayno @IMPRINTCLOUDS Took me a while.  https://t.co/Y4iPg30mpi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1DtHaiSs Nem eu!  Já memorizei todos os anúncios lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lostaircatcher I hope whoever offended you falls in an open manhole.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1DtHaiSs Não, Spotify sem pagar é só os lábios com gloss, com gloss e purpurina é Spotify premium pago por outra pessoa.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sunflower_vol_8 It's so lovely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@plaincab @tylerrjoseph And what a good looking group of fans!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@plaincab @tylerrjoseph You guys look amazing!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So wholesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you go to #ElliotPage's Wikipedia page, everything is already correct, the name, the pronouns!  At first I was confused what people were talking about and then my brain clicked.  I'm very proud of him. He's been one of my favorite for a long time and I'm glad he found himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheElliotPage I'm so happy for you! I'll never stop being a fan.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HAB1T28 @hbwwxlls No, I do. It's about how guys get followers so fast because they are guys. And how creepy and kinda icky that is. It's like people are desperate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HAB1T28 @hbwwxlls I know, I know. But even for a stan account you have already a ton of followers, so don't worry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HAB1T28 @hbwwxlls But at the same time you are complaining about having over 1000 followers...the little accounts will feel like shit lol  I've been on twitter for years. it's not a stan account more like "everything I like and little bits of my life" account but i don't even have 400 followers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HAB1T28 @hbwwxlls I'm going to be very honest. It is kinda weird and creepy how people react when a boy joins a fandom/bandom that is usually more associated with girls. It's like an endangered animals just showed up and everyone wants to protect it. It's like it's the last he/him on earth. 1/2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>His first name is "complete".  So what about Elton Johnathan?  And my sleepy brain couldn't handle it. Elton Johnathan. Why the hell is that so funny to me?! I'm still giggling and I thought about this at 7 am.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This morning I woke up too early so I stayed in bed but I couldn't fall asleep again so I started imaging names of musicians if they weren't "shortened", for example Harold Styles. Robert Dylan. Alexander Turner. Edward sheen. Frederick Mercury and then I got to #EltonJohn.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Nothing. zero. zilch. This is Louis Tomlinson discrimination!!!  https://t.co/3ROzKuzwbJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was in the mall and I checked the music store, and look at this shit: harry and Niall 's newest albums? Right in the front. Liam? There were some albums in front of his. Zayn? It starts with z so it was pretty much the last album on the cd display thing. Louis???? NADA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OH_DEAD_ @copitamonstrual It was very funny.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@taronenthusiast King's speech and a single man are soooo good. And then he is all clumsy and dreamy in love actually, and then he is the guy from Bridget Jones diary that made me go "oh dear, this man is so much more loveable then Hugh Grant, what is Renée thinking?".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Y0UWISHx Then I listened to sign of the times and I was like " holy shit, this is so good. This guy can sing!". Forgot about it, didn't listen to any other songs. Then quarantine happened. And I started listening to music I never listened to... And now here I am.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@elizaeggerton @taronenthusiast You know how he sang an Elton John song on Sing and then he played Elton in Rocketman? You do. Well in Rocketman he sang a song called Hercules so maybe...who knows?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taronenthusiast The only that should happen is Merlin singing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@taronenthusiast In the organisation, the new Lancelot! The other movie was about getting a new Lancelot they wouldn't kill the new one so soon, right?  Oh and then there's Merlin. Iconic. Vaughn would not dare to touch one thread of Merlin's sweater. Safety guaranteed.  *It. Never. Happened.*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taronenthusiast Did you know that Kingsman 2 was just a collective hallucination? Matthew Vaughn would not be dumb enough to kill the most beloved character, JB the pug, who was key in showing Eggsy's caring nature. He would never kill off the only female character, the most badass agent in 1/2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I hope that thing you really want is not sold out, and that stuff you were wishing for is at least 50% cheaper. Beware of sketchy websites and if you end up going to a physical store, I don't care if you have to superglue the mask to your face, BE SAFE.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BURYMYB0N3S She's fabulous!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@esnysweetener I don't know. I think he thrives to be recognised for his work and not really his image, plus since he doesn't tour or act he does not reach certain audiences.

<|startoftext|>@Lucozade_28 This is so stupid. I love it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HSHQ @AMAs It's not like Harry was the person tweeting this but I hope that sometimes he checks out "his" social media and sees how many people are truly happy for him and thankful for him and his music :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HSHQ @AMAs  https://t.co/WsEGSAuOlh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HSHQ @AMAs Congratulations to Harry and everyone who helped create the album.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tom_linsonwalls ... this is already awful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@buIIets It was the first one I ever heard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait, have I begged for a copy of #Vogue's December issue, with #HarryStyles on the cover, today??? No? Well, please please please. Someone. Please. I'll send you candy and a thank you card.  https://t.co/cVefObkXL1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1DtHaiSs What we need is an "emotional" sugar daddy. Someone who just wants to talk about his day, tell stories about his grandkids, about going fishing or something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sourdieseltbsl Damn. I'm going to smile like an idiot everytime I remember this.  I wish we had more images of the guys with their kids but at the same time I'm glad we don't because privacy is extremely important. They must all be pretty cool dads.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sourdieseltbsl That's so cute. So heartwarming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sourdieseltbsl I was like wait, what if there's a stocking with the baby's name, but nope. We will never learn her name.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1DtHaiSs A man sent me a DM the other day actually wanting me to be his sugar baby and promising me a weekly allowance and for a second I thought " band merch... It could all be mine." But then my brain restarted and I did not even answer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpwkbixtches  https://t.co/AIqF204ab4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1DtHaiSs Icarus falls.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was what it was. But if you watch the last episode of season 5 again you can clearly see that if it had ended there... Now that would have been a worthy finale.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I finally watched the #SPN finale and if it had ended with Dean driving to the sound of the original song, not the whole Sam growing old and that cover, it would have been a lot better, because that song is actually Dean's song. And he was laying his weary head to rest.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What a bunch of rude bastards. You wish you were as cute, as funny and as as talented.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gwsevi They were short on time and forgot to add iconic, funny and extremely cute, the one and only, the very attractive, #lewiscapaldi.  But seriously, that is just mean.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@94STYLINSUNN I would rather he only said something on social media twice a year but that it was actually him writing it, and that he said something "unscripted".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HSFL0RALN No, it makes me laugh.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#HarryStyles: *is unlabeled and wears some dresses* Fans: such a chill dude. He loves fashion. It's pretty cool. Haters: boo hoo boy in a dress is not manly! Delirious people: he is a non binary icon, a gender fluid legend.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lostwithoutlwt Good luck to everyone!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lostwithoutlwt I get so excited and happy. And since your packages are "mystery" packages, it's even better! The surprise is just as good as the packet itself. When you grow up people usually stop giving you presents and give you money instead, therefore surprises become a rare occurrence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lostwithoutlwt But things changed, I was reaching this anxiety peak ( I am bipolar + anxiety) and it felt that even interacting with someone via snail mail was social interaction and it freaked me out.

<|startoftext|>@lostwithoutlwt Hi! I'm from Portugal.  I used to have a lot of penpals back in the day.

<|startoftext|>@tpwkbixtches I watched the whole movie. I wasn't a Harry Styles fan back then, but I was and still am a Tom Hardy Fan, and I really loved Barry Keoghan in the killing of a sacred deer ( an odd but very good film). And I never watched Dunkirk again lol too quiet and vague for me.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HABIT1994  https://t.co/SMq5NdwW6p<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@finelinerm He could wear anything and I'd be happy because he would pull it off no matter how ugly the clothes were.  And yes, many people would like if Harry was naked all the time. Not me. That would be unhygienic and awkward.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1direction_ing @XXGOLD3N Awww that's nice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rainbowslinky It's 2020. Even the tree is depressed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fuckleox You are an expert at buying pants.  These are pretty cool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradTaste You're wasting your time. Let him talk shit, it's probably the only thing that comes out if his mouth.  Without attention he will shut up. Plus if he dislikes you so much why does he invest his precious time talking about you?   Let the good times roll.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dark1Pilots No. You'll get wrinkles.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Oh #GusVanSant is one of the directors of the #Gucci videos!  He is one of my favorite directors!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Daily begging post:  Will some kind soul please get me a copy of the December issue of #Vogue with Harry Styles in the cover? Pppplllleeaaaasssseeee?  I'm serious, I really really want it. Thanks for your time.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hippieangeI Idk but if one band member is not in a band's group picture I always like to pretend he/she/they are taking the picture and that's why they aren't in said picture.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CassGizmo Blankets, little bats, little pies... You are coziness personified.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CassGizmo And there's A lot more but I don't really know about it because I'm the kind of person who thinks pizza should be the main food lol  Question: is eggnog good?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CassGizmo Cod is the tradition. We literally have hundreds of recipes.  Then there are these fruit cakes called king cake and queen cake and my parents love them. And there's filhoses, rabanadas which don't really have a translation and these puffy fried round shaped things called dreams.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CassGizmo I have family in Germany! Maybe one day we can visit Germany at the same time lol<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@foundavein LOL no. But Harry Styles can pull off any outfit, any accessory, and his opinions on fashion and music are fantastic. The best thing about the vogue issue is actually the interview/article, it's quite inspiring. He didn't start anything but he sure supports it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@XXGOLD3N Start counting regularly. Then say 58, 72, 21, 18, 265 etc you will lose count. Next time try to eat breakfast alone or try to change the subject. Maybe watch TV or listen to music while you eat, it will distract you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Reasons why I think rape is often worse than murder: You can't rape someone in self defense. you can't rape someone to keep them from killing up kids in a school. You can't rape someone for the greater good. You can't rape someone without scarring them for life.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@buIIets And the fact he doesn't have a proper name is actually great. His real name is Five, which means that when Reginald calls everyone by their numbers he is talking to them as lab rats but since  Five's real name is Five he is the only one whose real name Reggie is forced to use.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@buIIets I think it's like, Vanya didn't need a name, right? The media would only cover what the other six did. And old man reggie told Grace to go name the six kids but he didn't specify which 6. So Five being a little shit and being close to Vanya decided he could be the unnamed one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theEmoArtHoe It's the production. It's really shitty but other than that I really like it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I really want that damn vogue issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#WorldKindnessDay more like #HarryStyles day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harryzstan The third one is my favorite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also the #HarryStyles vogue interview also made me feel sad  because he mentions his friends and how he loves being with them and I have like a friend and half if that and I feel lonely as shit right now. Depression is a cruel bitch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#HarryStyles 's interview/article on the December issue of Vogue is very good. It made me feel peaceful, and it is very inspiring.  "He is the image of a new era, of the way that a man can look.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Harry_Styles @voguemagazine @Tyler_Mitchell_ If you guys are only looking at the photos you are missing a wonderful and absolutely inspiring interview.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bndtherules @Harry_Styles @voguemagazine @Tyler_Mitchell_ His hair in the we one is perfect.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gonerboner He needs to shave his head desperately. I hope Rosie pulls his hair everytime she is close enough to do it. That haircut deserves to be painful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gonerboner In the 2nd one, why does his face look like an off brand 11 from stranger things?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wallsiicflt I don't care. It is what is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luvletter_lou @tpwkbixtches I have the flattest ass in the world so if I ever cry because of his ass it's because I wish mine was at least 1/10 as big as his.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TPWKYUPP 5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@miaxlouiss And wether he dated or slept with or date all these women... Who cares? It's his personal life!  But they made it sound like he had a revolving door in his house/hotel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@miaxlouiss It just keeps going and going. It's almost like *Harry touches waitress' hand when he is paying for his coffee* the media: "Harry Styles seen holding an anonymous girl's hand very passionately. Is he trying to figure out her ring size????!!!!!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouisClouds28 @miaxlouiss @niallnationSF But I thought they "never really talked to eachother" "and they weren't close"... OH Zayn... I don't think even Zayn believed himself when he said that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KILLJ0YREV This would only make sense, AND even then it would not be a good idea because no one knows what other people have gone through, if it was a philosophy or a psychology class.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouTube So since last year's sucked so bad you just gave up? You have so much material for this year, the bad things Vs the good. The year you could actually send a message is the year you don't make a rewind video?  Ok then. You do you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lokiattme "Rumor has it that they’re dating again."  Didn't they get together again like years ago? Or did they break up again and got back together?  Or is their relationship just a rumour now?  Actually, I don't even know why I'm asking this. I don't give 2 shits lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lokiattme They say styles but then they don't say anything about him.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KevinNewburn The first 5 seasons? Great show. Fun, emotional, it had a good storyline and it could have ended there. The other seasons? It keeps getting worse. It's still watchable. But it's mostly fan service.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It was me. I know it was me. Because they were mine and they were in my room, but I didn't leave one single chip because I'm lazy. It was late and dark and I didn't see it.  I am still lazy though. Just not this time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who was the bastard that left one, ONE, Pringle in the tube thing?! How lazy can you be to leave one chip on the package just so you do have to throw it away?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>REMINDER: if I call you guy, dude or man, and your pronouns are not he/him, PLEASE correct me. When I'm talking I call everyone dude and then I end up writing it as well. Also, if I do it it's because I forgot or didn't check your pronouns it your profile. It's never on purpose.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Today's psych appointment made me feel so tired... And then the doctor proceeds to schedule another one for the 19th. Wtf? She used to schedule them 3 months apart from each other. I know it sounds like I'm whining but it's exhausting for my brain.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@UpdateHLD @wallsiicflt She looks amazing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hayleymybestie Considering how repulsed she looks like when she is with Trump she most likely did.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>To all my #american friends: If you can stay home, STAY HOME. whatever the result of the election is, there will be protests and violence.  If you are part of a minority, be extra cautious!  I don't have the money to fly to the USA to kick the ass of whoever hurts you or<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1DtHaiSs I don't know why but right now this is the funniest shit ever.  https://t.co/H260ocVbAH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lostaircatcher Same. When my country has elections, only my country is affected. When it's the USA, it feels like the whole world is affected. Trump is despicable, he should not be in charge of anything including himself. He is a shame to the whole human species.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IovedangeI I'm telling you, someone put a camera on a bird or is using a drone. These are so stalker like. But his hair looks so good that I can be 100% mad at the photographer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JOSHESCULT T word is his rapper name. Wait, he is already a rapper. Kinda. Sort of.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arianaxwiccan They changed so many things that are canon in the comics, I hope they don't pick Ned becoming a villain to be one of the things they actually stay faithful to. I love him.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tpwkbixtches Omg, I didn't even see Louis at first. I'm dying. This is hilarious and terrifying at the same time! Wtf. I think it's more horrifying than funny.  https://t.co/rm7vCe3ho0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@canyonmooonxx His hair looks very healthy on the second one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@canyonmooonxx It's not my favourite but it's really well cute.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@canyonmoonblu I heard he can even turn his phone on and off. Be still my heart!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1DtHaiSs Parece tão novinho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@canyonmoonblu Someone is on a balcony or some shit taking pictures of him, lol he can't breathe without a picture being taken. " We have confirmation! Harry Styles did in fact inhale oxygen two seconds ago. Wait for our new up--- and he exhaled! BRAVO!"<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Dark1Pilots I read activated so in my mind I just pictured Josh and Tyler passed out in a supply closet and Jenna and Debbie like "good thing we deactivated them when we did. I guess it's time to activate them again." *Presses button*  *robot voice* "currently my level of concern is low".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wallsandghosts The first time I listened to this song I was like " oh, turns out Louis Tomlinson was the person that invented sadness". It's heartbreaking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harolderoda No. Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradTaste The way you speak and your vocabulary makes you sound a lot more mature. You are very articulate and when it comes to music you actually know what you are talking about so people assume you are older because it's a skill that usually takes a while to develop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fr4vinha Mas que raio é aquilo que tiram de dentro do nariz?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@93SPAYNO He looks younger... Healthier and not stressed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LOUG0LDEN Just eat slowly and do something else at the same time, like watching TV, because that way you are paying less attention to the food. if the food is somewhat bland you have less trouble eating it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LOUG0LDEN Water and toast (or saltines) usually helps.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bravestlouie28 I have depression, nothing makes me happy. But that is still good advice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bravestlouie28 Or in his case pick someone who is both because I don't see him dating anyone unattractive any time soon lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bravestlouie28 He loves it because he is talented.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bravestlouie28 @wallsandghosts Someone needs to make a harry styles quote book and sell that shit on Etsy because they would make some good money to spend on Christmas.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FEARLESSANG3L Midnight memories and laugh  are the best. The if I could fly would be better if it didn't have the diamonds/sparkles thingies. Fools gold would be prettier as a bracelet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harolderoda Lol no he won't, and he is also not aware of about 99% of us. But he makes good music, he is a kind person, and being a fan of his work is pretty nice. He is thankful for the collective and appreciates his supporters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradTaste Evolution is fake is a stupid remark, but "who was the first scientist" is actually one hell of a question.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Didi81_ Yes! Specially when the book is longer. I bought a copy of Anna Karenina in paperback form and I still haven't read it.

<|startoftext|>@Didi81_ I know. Sometimes we are just too nice lol  But it's always the same thing.

<|startoftext|>The hat Harry is wearing in the Golden promo makes him look like a boy scout going fishing or a 4 year old on the beach. That being said, it's #HarryStyles he could put a teapot on his head and make it look  high fashion. He doesn't have the ability to look " not good".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewInvention_ No. This is you having an epiphany.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewInvention_ This is... Genius. You could trade boobs, buy extra boobs, not wear the boobs. You could change them according the event and the clothes. Take them off to sleep or to exercise... What a dream.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ibetterzjm Bom dia!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grandson Dude, just say you're 27 because the 27 club is what people call the group of musicians that died at 27( Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Amy Winehouse etc). Saying you are part of the 27 club sounds like you died and are tweeting from the afterlife.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Y0UWlSH "I showered with Harry Styles because he proposed"  LOL where did he propose at? In the bathroom? Or maybe it's something<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CLIKKIEPHOBlC Instead of posting something every now and then, they just go silent for ages and then dump a shit ton of stuff on top of us on the same day.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sunwllrise @RIDEVOCALS Hahahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RIDEVOCALS He's afraid Nico followed him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RIDEVOCALS It's like he is trying to make sure no one is going to kidnap him OR like he doesn't know where the hell he is. Like he went to sleep in his bed and woke up in that place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hellwentz Each person wrote a note and suggested a chord.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@immortaIgays !!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ceoofftwww I know it's hard to do some basic tasks when we are feeling down. Some people may see it and think "oh that person is disgusting and lazy" but I don't.   Trust me, you will feel better after you shower. It's like crying, in the end you feel relaxed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@idwfallaway She donated, that's cool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lovefaithharry @Harry_Styles I'm bitches.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradTaste The voice of an angel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@the_tommo_way16 Maybe he didn't sleep well. But when you lean forward it creates weird shadows. Grab a mirror and put it down and look at it, you'll see it.  But his cheeks look hollow and the eyes tired.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TinPrints Blackbird by the Beatles aka my favorite song ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@the_tommo_way16 I think it's because he is leaning down a bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@the_tommo_way16 He looks good but also tired and skinny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@avra_cadaver I adore it already.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lokiattme This is the best match.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lokiattme It's so pretty! I want it so bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dark1Pilots It's my favorite version of this song. Way before I ever started listening to their music, I was already a huge fan of this video.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiamPayne I know you're promoting the glasses bit honestly the star of the show is the jacket.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiamPayne You are allergic to not working, aren't you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JOSHESCULT No, I totally get it. in a month they may be sold out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harrymoonchild @lovefaithharry Next time he should show what he carries on his purse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JOSHESCULT Honestly I would wait for blackfriday to get it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My left eyebrow had a botched plastic surgery aka the wax spread too much and now it's thinner and shorter than the right eye row ( which is always the good one). Time to part my hair to the left and cover it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If I had an only fans account my target audience would be people with very low standards that like pictures of someone ugly posing and doing stuff that is in no way possible close to being sexual.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@canyonmooonxx I like how he looks even more excited than the kids.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@canyonmooonxx The first one looks like a father/child picture.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@canyonmooonxx The second picture... Such a cute baby. And the little girl is cute too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harrystitsx That's a really cute baby.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@canyonmoonblu Hoodie. It's starting to get cold.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harrymoonchild @lovefaithharry Santa: Where you a good boy this year? Harry: Yes I really was. Santa: so, what do you want for Christmas? Harry: privacy! Santa: * is secretly obsessed with Harry* Santa: I'm very sorry but the toy factory is all out of privacy. Maybe next year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZOURRYSBIGDICK No, you're too heavy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's been like a month but I still only hear gibberish in the first sentence of Better by #Zayn. Peaky blinders is easier to decipher than whatever he is saying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ambroire @LiamPayne  https://t.co/8ZmtDsgmfA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@izaoned @LiamPayne Not Liam, but Happy Birthday nonetheless.  https://t.co/SlwCekB0uT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@habitjsex @LiamPayne Soa melhor que poesia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@habitddl @LiamPayne It honestly looks like a football covered with a blanket that's glued to it on the top.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiamPayne With the eyeliner I really hope one of his costumes is either emo boy or goth guy. It would be funny as shit, but I'm guessing it's the leftovers from a Captain Jack Sparrow situation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stylesereja Espero k haja espaço para a sobremesa.  https://t.co/pkKuZR1DVt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1DtHaiSs Entrada, prato principal e a sobremesa.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dark1Pilots I know Nico is a guy but in my head it's actually a badass woman obviously played by Charlize Theron.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dema_who I impersonate a raccoon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZTSCVLT For a little bit the band turned into Zayn and the directions. Vocalist and background singers.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ComicsintheGA I never related to Hulk this much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@canyonmooonxx Yes but without the towel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lokiattme Idk if he understands pop culture references. We don't know when he became a ghost.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@clxbstyles  https://t.co/AyDCaD3iZ2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lokiattme There are too many people trying to communicate and the WiFi in the afterlife isn't the best. His electronic  ouija board probably froze.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lokiattme You are trying to befriend a spirit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pootatoofniall @sweethouiss Não é fofo naquelas fotos. Aqui está adorável.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lokiattme Liam doesn't half shit anything. I said this before but he was probably that guy in school that didn't care if he had to do the group project by himself because he wanted to assure the final result was good enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lokiattme I think the only country that celebrates the traditional Halloween is the USA. Here in my country, we basically have the stores filled with Halloween costumes for kids but they never go trick or treating. It's basically dress up as a witch and eat candy day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lokiattme I like how invested he is in this Halloween thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VAMPlREHONEY *in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@canyonmooonxx Nah, the mirror says it before he has a chance to say it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rochxsunflower @paulspelotuda lol yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InstaTrent Yes but sometimes I want to give my opinion on lgbtqa issues or conversation and I want to know if I am overstepping or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VAMPlREHONEY They are on one of his boxes of arts and crafts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lokiattme @Louis_Tomlinson Hey there, just so you know I just stole this from you. The second one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Didi81_ I'm always afraid the person is like " why is this stranger interacting to me/ giving me advice/ suggesting thing? What a creep." It's even worse when you check the account and it's like a 13 year old. I follow some minors here but it's because of music or something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, honest question, I am a bit dumb.  Is it ok to say you are part of #LGBTQA if you are #asexual and straight? Or have #heterosexual tendencies or whatever you want to call it? Or does the heterosexuality part immediately revokes your "LGBTQA membership"???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If back in the day I had the option to do school online, I'm pretty sure my marks would have been so much better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPIKEINMYH3ART Aren't those synonyms?  I'm joking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I was younger I wanted bigger boobs, and now I still do but it's not because of vanity, I just wished my cats had bigger pillows when they cuddle with me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have people forgotten that time Justin Bieber was spitting on his fans? Cause I think some people did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPIKEINMYH3ART  https://t.co/LVtowtXEUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Posts by accounts I am not even following show up on the tl  (because people I do follow,  follow them)and I assume I am following them and interact and then I realize what I did and I get really embarrassed.  https://t.co/25MXFopAnB<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lokiattme Cole or Liam?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@my_kiwis He isn't ugly, put him in cool clothes, tell him to shut up and sit still and he becomes pretty acceptable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@my_kiwis Not really.  https://t.co/kgNV9PYXCp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@payneculture Niall or Gigi?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPIKEINMYH3ART Bad at sports?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2 of my cats have a cold, they keep sneezing ( it's adorable) and since they still walk around the house everywhere, my other, healthy, cat decided to isolate on my grandma's bedroom and he only comes out to eat food, eat grass and use the litter box. He is so smart!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ibsolonely @canyonmooonxx Hahahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sammythefishh @JOSHESCULT Oooo that sounds cool af. I love horror stories.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DazzlerAOA Body horror as in "wtf is this shit, these special effects are awful, and look, they lost about a bathtub full of blood and they haven't died yet", like in b movies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harolderoda Thanks girl should play rugby, did you see how strong she was?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DazzlerAOA I just assume there's gonna be a monster in the lake, like in lotr before they enter Moria, and even if there isn't, I can't swim and I KNOW that the only way to escape will be a shitty rickety boat, and the engine will malfunction right when we are in the middle of the lake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nblm2D Cute af.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sweethouiss Não há nada de fofo no Zayn. O Louis sim, parece aquelas pessoas que adoram aninhar-se no sofá.  "Zayn the cute boy... Zayn the bad boy more like".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JOSHESCULT Ok, so, what does he do? Because after reading a million tweets about him I'm still confused.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@phantomparades You can cough You can cry Having the worst time of your life Ooh, see that girl Watch the scene Digging the drama queen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harolderoda A multitude of fatal facial expressions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harolderoda About to threat the competition.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harolderoda Protective little boy in kindergarten.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harolderoda Holding his breath so he doesn't do anything he will regret.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harolderoda Like a predator about to attack a prey.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harolderoda Looks like a serial killer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harolderoda That looks like a vengeful spirit in a supernatural episode.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@captnofthesspjm Your eyebrows are majestic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshuadnn Curly hair and floral shirt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mixermanagement @LiamPayne @LittleMix His hair is extra fluffy today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zoebutnotreally This last one is perfect lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FALLlNGCHERRY I mean, thirst is thirst.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FALLlNGCHERRY That's the cutest dog ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stwberrystyles1 De facto parecem confortáveis juntos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshuadnn It's already amazing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@D0CSHARTENS I approve this manifestation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Directionieber Louis is the best song ever written.  Ok then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Didi81_ Damn, he's slow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>16 years later and "O" by #DamienRice is still one of my favorite albums. I absolutely forgot how much I love his work, but Spotify just reminded me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brina0336 @theabesolonely Oh makes sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tinastyles33 Exactly. In the video they all looked absolutely miserable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@valencivaIenci @888becca  https://t.co/JFB1sTeuS4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@888becca The pictures... Management  made them do it. And it was probably part of the campaign. They are famous, therefore people pay attention to them, if they associate or promote something people will probably want to help too. In the video they were all crying and shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Here4Z @rlckyrlcardo @888becca This.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tinastyles33 Idk why Zayn is smiling but maybe he wanted the kids to have a "happy" memory of the day or it's something he does instinctively since he is photographed a million times. And it's still not funny, but I still chuckled at that photo because he really didn't read the room.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tinastyles33 It's ridiculous. They were doing charity. And the photos were probably part of the campaign. Because they are famous which means that people will pay attention to whatever they are saying or sponsoring, and maybe help too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@888becca Wasn't this for charity?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alwayshs28 Why would Harry dedicate a song to Niall?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomlinsxnskiwi @PHOBlCS @IC4RUSMALIK @MAP0FINSOMNIA A little? A lot!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know the exact time the Golden music video will be released.  The second I fall asleep. that's when. #goldeniscoming #HarryStyles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomlinsxnskiwi @PHOBlCS @IC4RUSMALIK @MAP0FINSOMNIA Oh god, I don't want that picture in my head. Then again, I don't think I can even see something that small.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomlinsxnskiwi @PHOBlCS @IC4RUSMALIK @MAP0FINSOMNIA Exactly. I don't think that's a thing doctors do lol<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KILLJ0YREV @MCUARAGORN Jeff Maloney is my favorite comedian.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peakyblinderlwt @RAINBERRYL0U Agreed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PHOBlCS @tomlinsxnskiwi @IC4RUSMALIK @MAP0FINSOMNIA Wait, I don't think doctors actually measure it and put it on medical records? I mean, my doctor doesn't have my bra size on my file.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomlinsxnskiwi @PHOBlCS @IC4RUSMALIK @MAP0FINSOMNIA If they can hack airport cameras maybe they can hack hospital records. Or maybe one of them is a doctor and had access to the information lol  Now about their sizes, it's very unlikely. Yes they probably slept with some fans but I don't think they carry measuring tapes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomlinsxnskiwi @IC4RUSMALIK @MAP0FINSOMNIA That's kind of a relief. Not a lot, but at least a little bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MAP0FINSOMNIA  https://t.co/7KQfFWby50<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MAP0FINSOMNIA And no, I wasn't looking for it. The image I saw with the blood types was from Pinterest, and now I went on Pinterest and it recommends you or shows you pics related to stuff you saw or clicked before.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MAP0FINSOMNIA @hippieangeI Oh no. I didn't even look for their sizes and it's like the third result in the blood type images. WTF. I don't want that information in my brain. Some of these people are either working for the FBI or are the real life Sherlock Holmes ( but 100x creepier). Amnesia, please?!  https://t.co/9fP2lR54BR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MAP0FINSOMNIA @hippieangeI I didn't believe they knew the blood type so I googled it and the first result was their blood types. It's not even something you have to dig. It's just there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IC4RUSMALIK @MAP0FINSOMNIA Wtf... How the hell do they even find that out?!  https://t.co/d7iTTnNFKC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@xyIobones Plus it is weird that they don't know about the popular ones nowadays... I don't listen to Taylor Swift but I know who she is. And Selena Gomez, Miley Cyrus, and Camila Cabello, and ( the ones I listen to) Lorde, Billie Eilish, Lady Gaga. How can someone not know Lady Gaga?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xyIobones It's kinda sad, imagine living without ever listening to Florence and the Machine, Janis freaking Joplin, Stevie Nicks, Amy Winehouse, Debbie Harry, Joan Jett, Pink, Aretha Franklin, Billie Holiday, Laura Marling, Siouxie Sioux, Cher, and so many other female musicians...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And they built a fancy cat shelter, with two levels, in the shape of a cute fake well, with the top covered and the entrances are on the side where the bricks should be  All of this do they have shelter when its raining. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm just trying to lure them out closer to my neighbors yard because they have actual safe shelters in her yard and she cooks for them. She is an altogether a great person. Oh and right next to is there's these couple offices where you get like certificates of address or somethin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are 6 new kittens in the neighborhood, we have like 10 usual strays but these were born a bit higher in the road.

<|startoftext|>@catnnibaI @manitobation Strangers are your best friends in concerts. You are sweating, dancing, singing together. It's like intimacy without consequences.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dimilovesharry @TPWKFLICKERR Exactly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TPWKFLICKERR @juliaiicf And I don't even like a lot of their band music I prefer the solo projects, but damn Wolves is a bop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TPWKFLICKERR @juliaiicf I LOVE that damn song. It's their funnest song.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@explictmonster And have talent. The talent part is key.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TGIFrida @drifted_soul_ @domsvaIentine @summertemptress @amalixxo I hope one day he is able to perform again, if that is something that would bring him happiness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TGIFrida @drifted_soul_ @domsvaIentine @summertemptress @amalixxo Anxiety is a bitch. Performing on a stage with thousands of people screaming and being the focus of everything sounds like anxiety hell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TGIFrida @drifted_soul_ @domsvaIentine @summertemptress @amalixxo Ah man, that's pretty sad. The fact that he is still so successful only proves how good of a musician he really is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drifted_soul_ @TGIFrida @domsvaIentine @summertemptress @amalixxo Probably. I just like to picture his face doing that lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TGIFrida @drifted_soul_ @domsvaIentine @summertemptress @amalixxo Wait, Zayn hasn't performed since then? No tours? I had no idea. I'm recent to the whole one direction thing. To be honest I don't even like most of their songs together, I prefer the solo music.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TGIFrida @drifted_soul_ @domsvaIentine @summertemptress @amalixxo I knew about Zayn, not about Liam though. That's pretty sad. But at least they got the good with the bad. They both do what they want and are great at it. They are in happy relationships, and zayn's biggest problem right now is probably changing stinky diapers :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TGIFrida @drifted_soul_ @domsvaIentine @summertemptress @amalixxo ... ok then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TGIFrida @drifted_soul_ @domsvaIentine @summertemptress @amalixxo And they are in the industry because they want to be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TGIFrida @drifted_soul_ @domsvaIentine @summertemptress @amalixxo And, I'll delete the kk tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TGIFrida @drifted_soul_ @domsvaIentine @summertemptress @amalixxo Ok, I didn't know that and therefore I apologize. But out of curiosity, which of them felt that way?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@domsvaIentine @urwhatuluv__ @DBATCats13 @amalixxo And you talk about this as if you could read their minds.  If you can though, please call me when you and the rest of the X-Men get together, I'd love to meet you all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@domsvaIentine @urwhatuluv__ @DBATCats13 @amalixxo Yes. they choked on a damn apple. But now they have all they can eat apple pies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@urwhatuluv__ @domsvaIentine @DBATCats13 @amalixxo Thanks :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@urwhatuluv__ @domsvaIentine @DBATCats13 @amalixxo  https://t.co/r4dYP3RlHw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@domsvaIentine @urwhatuluv__ @DBATCats13 @amalixxo Nowadays, they can afford all the lawyers they want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@urwhatuluv__ @domsvaIentine @DBATCats13 @amalixxo I kinda want to highfive you :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TGIFrida @summertemptress @domsvaIentine @amalixxo The lack of privacy thing is something that I do consider pretty awful.  But nothing in life comes free of cost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@domsvaIentine @urwhatuluv__ @DBATCats13 @amalixxo Well I am bipolar, and my depression is awful and so is my anxiety and I tried to kill myself twice. Maybe if I had my dream job and money I would be happy. Maybe I wouldn't. But guess which one is more likely?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@domsvaIentine @amalixxo Nothing in life is guaranteed but death. Maybe consider that they all might be in a good headspace, healthy and happy. Or maybe they aren't. Or maybe some are and others aren't.  And mental illness is complicated. Better have a renowned therapist than nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@domsvaIentine @amalixxo Now you are speculating about celebrity suicides/ destructive behaviours.  If we analyse it, then we have to start crying for every celebrity ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@domsvaIentine @amalixxo And that money can be used by going to the best therapists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@domsvaIentine @DBATCats13 @amalixxo Oh, sorry. I actually did not notice that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@domsvaIentine @amalixxo Yup. And how many other musicians did the same and were nowhere near as successful?  What management did was not ok at all, but their "sacrifice" had a happy ending.  And that's all I can to say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@domsvaIentine @summertemptress @amalixxo I rather be depressed and rich than depressed and broke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@domsvaIentine @summertemptress @amalixxo Once again you have never been poor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@domsvaIentine @DBATCats13 @amalixxo The privacy thing : completely agree, specially harry. He can't sneeze without someone taking a picture.  But the whole persona they had to pretend to be... That's gone. Now they are who they want to be. They make the music they want to make. They date whoever they want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My depression is getting worse and worse but as long as I keep replying to tweets with GIFs of harry styles laughing no one will know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@summertemptress @domsvaIentine @amalixxo And they are successful musicians, which was their dream.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@domsvaIentine @amalixxo And imagine where they would be now. Maybe they wouldn't have kids or meet their significant others.  Maybe they wouldn't even be musicians.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wallznouis  https://t.co/Nuw8elzNaL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@domsvaIentine @amalixxo You obviously never been poor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DumbMannn Wtf? She looks so much younger!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@domsvaIentine @amalixxo Zayn looked pretty rough when he left though. At one point he looked just tired and sick, completely emaciated.  The label was a piece of shit to them BUT it is not like they were tortured at gunpoint.   It's sad but I think the good times were very rewarding and memorable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@domsvaIentine @amalixxo Also weren't they 16 or 17 when they were on the X factor? That's pretty close to adulthood.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@domsvaIentine @amalixxo Yes they went through some shit. But when the band ended they had fame ( which helps a lot when you need a fanbase), money ( which means that they will never have to worry about paying a bill), experience and connections. That's a good reward.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@STILLXWASTED You know when you find a picture of a celebrity with a fan but someone crops the picture so we only see the celebrity?  That's what this is. Except the "fan" is also in the band.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@xstreamwallsx I only started listening to their solo music a few months ago, I only like a few of the 1d songs, and this post just made me sad af, so I can't possibly imagine how "real" fans feel, but it must be awful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@XMenFilms Awesome!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I didn't do it for attention. I really thought it would work this time. Not even a damn email.  And that's how forgettable I am.  Cool, cool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Came back a few days later, got my social media back ( except Tumblr I'll do it later) and not a single message. Not even my best friend of 10 years. Let's be honest, since she moved it's not like we talk that much, but still. I hinted about it here and no one got it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradTaste Since you moved in with Tina you are getting so much better. It's awesome to see you do so well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SunflowerVolmiz Someone contact Tumblr, it's also blue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emmaj95160782 @SunflowerVolmiz I love this so much, I got steal it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nolene_alana @28Vashappening @SunflowerVolmiz Well consider your meme also stolen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FALLlNGCHERRY It was such a gracious keyboard smash that I thought something was just lost in translation lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_jxnesyy I can't believe I once stole a random bottle of water, that was left behind by whoever, so me and 5 other people would not be thirsty during a The Drums gig... That took place in a bar. That sells drinks. And has bathrooms. That have working sinks.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My psychiatrist was one hour late today and to be honest I was so pissed off. The waiting room has the most uncomfortable chairs ever. I rather sit on a bush of roses.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FALLlNGCHERRY ... I got them when I was a kid but like, I was already in school. My mom kept taking me to the store, they would mark a dot on my ear and then I would run away because I was really scared. I guess one day I was just too tired to run.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dema_who Good night!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saturday don't forget! Check him out on YouTube. You will not regret it. #BradTaste.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradTaste This is hilarious. I haven't been around on the streams cause I've been busy, but trust me, Ill be back soon.  This video just shows that your toothpaste commercial wasn't just a one time thing. You can be very very funny.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@fleetingfriend @DZIKIRIDDLE It's Sam Pepper. His brain has a very severe allergy to intelligence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@L34THERM0UTH Pet names... Ok. Perdita, air bud, pongo, Pascal, Brian Griffin, cosmo, lassie, Marie, Garfield, snoopy, Marcel ( Ross Geller's monkey), zero, Santa's little helper, Beethoven...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DZIKIRIDDLE And if you just made this up,  https://t.co/WZIwD1ejeB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DZIKIRIDDLE Also, if this is real, don't be embarrassed, a girl in my year in highschool got lice, we all discussed it privately so the whole school didn't found out about it and from the 20 girls an 2 boys from our class that knew, no one judged her or made fun of her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DZIKIRIDDLE Get the shampoo, use it properly, then comb your hair with one of those combs that they usually include with the shampoo. Change all the pillow covers, get clean bedding. wash all your hats and hoodies and you should be fine. That's what my mom did when I was 5.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thizaintaparty It's more like creative association, not synesthesia. It involves knowledge about the artist as well. But some people just project different things to me that I associate with all the 5 senses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so glad I know why Trysha painintheass is trending without actually having to look at the comprising images.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@niallsjest Bem... Café é basicamente água com cafeína.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DumbMannn Why do I still have a crush on Pete Davidson?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thizaintaparty @Meelsky7 And *live (not life)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thizaintaparty @Meelsky7 *sounds ( not movies!*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thizaintaparty Sometimes different singer's voices actually make think of specific colors, feel different textures and tastes and scents, which is weird but it feels like I can see it with my own eyes. It's not synesthesia just something that happens sometimes when I really focus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thizaintaparty the best way to chill is to turn the lights off, put on an album and actually listen to the songs in the correct order while you lay down on your bed. Pay attention to every single word and sound. suddenly the world outside is quiet. No worries. It's just you and the song.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thizaintaparty The goosebumps you get when you listen to a song for the first time and makes you shiver because it's so good... One of the best feelings ever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thizaintaparty Some music feels like you are being invited to dance freely in a forest and others make me straighten up my back and walk like a badass. Music goes through your body like a ghost phasing through a wall, for a little bit you feel the sound waves go through as if they were water.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thizaintaparty @Meelsky7 Sometimes music makes me cry to the point of exhaustion. On really hot days it feels like I am delirious and the movies comes forth like a heat wave. During life shows it makes my heart beat loud enough that I can hear it in my head and feel it in my stomach.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thizaintaparty @Meelsky7 It depends. Sometimes I feel like I'm floating, other times it makes me feel like I was buried alive. My favourite state is when it feels like I'm surrounded by nothing but sounds, I can feel the music in my body, as if it was an actual living thing that can touch you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@harolderoda He looks like he hasn't slept or shaved for at least 2 weeks. He needs a break.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harolderoda I would sell my soul for his first album in vinyl. And I have a record player so you can totally give it away to someone who doesn't have one.  https://t.co/jvAQo76iXh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harolderoda To be honest, it's not even a quote, it's his "it is what it is" tattoo.  At the end of the day, all the events that unfold and we have no way to change, the way we can't avoid death, the way nature works, "it is what it is" brings me comfort when I have no control over my life.  https://t.co/eUhtZ60gVS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Penso que o #LouisTomlinson tem um corte de cabelo de quarentena absolutamente horrível  e não quer rapar o cabelo, por isso está a deixar o cabelo para poder fazer um corte bonito. E é por isso que não mostra a Cara.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KerinCunningham If you have the money, buy them. When the quarantine is over, everyone you know will have the same outfits and you'll be the person that doesn't repeat an outfit for a long time, the trend setter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder if models have any ugly friends?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshGarnett12 Mte<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@payno_valntyne I hope it went well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arrystyle Lots of love indeed. That is so pretty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@payno_valntyne 1 ou 4.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dreamwithhrry @hstylespics @Harry_Styles @HSHQ Best reply.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@payno_valntyne ... because the blouses clearly have a negative effect on his singing abilities and song writing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@everysunflwer Eu seria incrível.  https://t.co/cWSI56Ldcl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@presclouds All the time. Specially if the character dies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@5saucesoflouis He always says something. He is one direction's number one fan lol I think he thinks that if he keeps hinting at a reunion then it will actually happen.  He's the sort of guy who watches titanic for the 26th time and still hopes Jack won't die.  OR A reunion will actually happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#LewisCapaldi must think he is really funny... I am NOT going to listen to before you go. It fucking killed me the first time I listened to it. I cried so much I died. I'm not dumb enough to go through that level of dehydration again.  https://t.co/4xfPLxz4mJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fearl94s Ideky but this is so accurate!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You may not like his voice, you may not even like his music but if you think #ConorOberst is a bad lyricist, I'm sorry honey but you are not allowed to read anything ever again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AaronSPeck ... yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenjaminRybolt @brighteyes @conoroberst This would be amazing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OT5Unseens Best Louis portrait I've ever seen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sweethouiss Posso dizer que concordo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sweethouiss Ainda só tem uns dias e já está vestida em Versace. Ainda mal abriu os olhos e já está a usar roupa que provavelmente custa mais do que toda a roupa que eu tenho.  Vai ser bem mimada mas mais do que isso, vai ser a bebé mais fashionable do Mundo todo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@niallsjest Compared to me he is tall but he has this "short" or "small" aura about him. he seems to be so gentle and like he gives great hugs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BoobearMr @niallsjest Absolutely stunning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@everysunflwer So damn nice.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@H4ILTHESAINTS I don't have any toxic friends, because I don't have friends!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@D0CSHARTENS Ok, can i steal these so I can use them as reactions? I mean with all the bullshit that goes around twitter, they are absolutely perfect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Five years by #DavidBowie is so damn good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ppredictors Someone did a cover of Bat out of hell by Meatloaf and accidentally summoned a demon bat that ended up starting the whole damn thing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ismalfoygirl @harwalls @livstomlinsons Eu falo de experiencia. Teve uma altura em que eu era magrinha e nos dias com muito vento, tinha de me inclinar para a frente ou acabava sentada no chão.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fleshfire @xmendirector @xmentas And trying to shoot one. I don't think that's going to do much damage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zjmidnght It's probably the third one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daffydiligent I mean I'm really happy he had a healthy little girl, but I'm more hyped about the song because that's what I am a fan of.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harwalls @livstomlinsons Evolução! Parece tão mais saudável. Na primeira foto, se o vento fosse forte ele caía de certeza.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BRIGHTLFTV The cringe...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@twoghosth @livstomlinsons A criança sabe divertir-se!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bestharrysbr Coitado :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@louislovesfish @DZIKIJOSEPH It looks like Zayn is a transformer elf.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sweethouiss Essa gente não tem noção.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@everysunflwer This is incorrect  Everyone knows that cancer always gets the most emotional ones and that's two of us. Gemini just stole it.  Then again I don't give two shits about the horoscope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, I already forgot what Zayn said on better, so I better than listen to it again.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DZIKIJOSEPH It's so pretty and chill. It's like that relaxed feeling you get when a painkiller kicks in and whatever hurt stops hurting.  I have no clue what he says in the beginning though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The song actually surprised me in a good way. So smooth and chill, r&amp;b with a sprinkle of pop. He sounded and looked great. I'm quite pleased :)  https://t.co/9QhzPKK79m<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can someone please tell what the hell #Zayn says in the beginning of the song? I don't understand a word.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zaynmalik The song is so chill. I feel relaxed and in peace.  I really really like it. Smooth af.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VinMan17 Ate pasta. I'm still depressed. This is false advertising.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DZIKIJOSEPH He is trying to "stay home" but all in different houses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Harry_StylesUp They need to start detaining these fans (or call their moms depending on their age) and he needs more security.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DumbMannn She saved her life by almost killing her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lifeofth3p4rty It's a baby holding a baby.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lifeofth3p4rty LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's A. M. Not am. Do like Louis, enunciate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someone needs to make a rule that forbids boybands from group dance choreographies. No more, please.  On another note Best song ever is not the best song ever. I wonder how they spent all night dancing to Bohemian rhapsody, it's not very danceable. #1d<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I finish listening to this 1d playlist I'll need a pop music cleanse and have a Radiohead day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was confused about why Abba's The winner takes it all was in a #1d playlist, turns out it's just the intro to Steal My Girl.  This is catchy af. Even if I didn't like their voices at all I'd still bop my head along.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happily could have better lyrics but honestly it sounds really good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FINELINESBBY @goldenswomanx @payno_valntyne It's so... The fan who did it probably needed some help with their mental health. If that happened in the US he could have just payed a kid to mow his lawn and run her over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Live While We're Young sounds like the perfect song to put on home videos of kids falling during summer activities. #1D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Truly madly deeply... Nope. That is not how that song goes. Sorry. Where's the dream? The wish? The fantasy?! #1D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@swxeetlouis Funny cause it's true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sweethouiss É melhor aproveitar porque com música nova e os deveres de Pai não vai ter tempo nem para dizer Hi.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@100gecslyricbot @Meelsky7 Beautiful and touching lyrics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Midnight Memories is just so much fun that I did not even listen to any part of the lyrics, for all I know it could about communism and Jurassic park.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some of these songs problems are just the lyrics. It sounds good and catchy and their voices sound great but then the lines are just bleh #1d<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Act my age's instrumental is Irish pirates of the Caribbean for middle schoolers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We need more pop music that isn't about romantic love or heartbreak!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankIero Opacalips  It's so cute.  https://t.co/jEHK0IuwFD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xboydivisionx Wait, which one is Frank?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@everysunflwer He looks like a kid and kids should not have kids.  É essa a razão. Ia parecer irmão mais velho em vez de Pai.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The band no matter how it ended. Even if they are close now or not, I'm sure they are all happy they met eachother and have good memories from their time they were together.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#1d I understand if this wasn't the music the boys  really wanted to make because I'm drowning in cheese. They have great voices though. The band brought them experience, opportunities, exposure and fame and money. For that alone I think they are all thankful for having been in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm listening to this playlist of basically all #1D songs ever, and I'm like 9 songs in and I only liked 2, I like more than that but I'm just going through the playlist, not what I've heard before.  Which is great because I usually can't stand boy bands or most pop music.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My two emotions about the #OneDirection fandom:  https://t.co/ZzTWwHp8yq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sweethouiss Louis fans get a tiny little crumb and that's enough to feed them for months. I mean, it has to. It's kind of endearing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#LouisTomlinson: *clicks the like button on #Zayn's baby post on Instagram* You guys: oh my god. The interaction!!!! Yes!   He literally clicked like and you are all acting as if they planned a slumber party together. Chill. One of these days one of you is gonna have a stroke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbyharoId @juliaiicf It means that the sun set and it was caught on film.  And that's is all. I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DZIKIJOSEPH Agreed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@94dRuNk @pallomberry Whoever thinks that... People are so delusional.  What, do they think they "rented" a kid just for a few photos? Snatched a baby from the street? Got a doll from a toy store?  https://t.co/GX3540n4B5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Thisisusxoned @tpwtomlinson Just in the USA I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpwtomlinson Ok ok, this one is pretty funny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bloodyfarah @DZIKIJOSEPH @ladygaga You are really talented.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zlorious @pallomberry As if the whole internet wasn't having a Zayn Fest already. Even deaf people will stream the song.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goldenswomanx @payno_valntyne Wasn't he the one who had to move houses in England because there was a fan that kept sleeping in his front yard or did I imagine that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@11hr11min @DZIKIJOSEPH It's anti spill!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fucktvlerjoseph It's iconic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not on Instagram because I don't have a life.   Which means I am on twitter because I don't have a life.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kara_janell Wtf?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dusktillouie Ele deve falar sobre o que quiser mas as vezes parece que tem medo de só falar sobre ele próprio, medo de que as fans se aboreçam ou só queiram saber da Banda e não dele.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CBNostalgia @WolverSteve Hahahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sweethouiss Conhecer Harry Styles e morrer... Tenho de admitir que adoro a ideia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My take on #1d: you can ship whoever you want in your head, with your friends and on fanfiction, but you can't bully real people in real life and try to force them to believe that something is true when you have no idea if it is or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mybabys01 He literally looks lightheaded here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mybabys01 Now you gotta make one for each boy so I can finally memorize which part each one sings lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mybabys01 This is fantastic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mybabys01 He wasn't doing well around this time, was he? He looks thin and tired. Sounds beautiful though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mybabys01 This is so good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@communistbutch I meant " if I believed in God". Phrased it wrong, I apologize.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@snuggleonaraft You accidentally posted duplicate photos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zaynsdetails @juliaiicf @zaynmalik So thats why he posted a picture of his back earlier. He was letting us know lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sunflowfalls It's stuck on my head now. Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MTV @paulspelotuda You, actually loving music? Are you sure, MTV? Are you sure?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@32LTWT He has slow internet connection and is still waiting for a tweet he wrote months ago to finally upload.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@32LTWT So specific yet so believable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@32LTWT He face swapped with another celebrity and we have been looking at him all year long without even knowing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LlGHTSUPANGEL @32LTWT @HAZXTOMO Ding ding ding we got a winner!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@32LTWT My theory is that he was eaten by a Wendigo and they are finishing the android that will take his place as real life Louis.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>BREAKING NEWS!!! : Ok, ok. We have reports of some fans  actually standing up... I guess they were just temporarily dead. Look, another one, wait, weak knees. And there she goes. She's helping her friend getting up. The solidarity! #ZaynMalik<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ZaynMalik thinking he would bring the fans back to life but he accidentally killed all of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a shame that #Zayn and Gigi's baby is going to grow up without a father. I mean, he is definitely going to be sentenced to life in prison after killing almost everyone I know on twitter.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I don't like big crowds. At all.  Except on concerts. There, you are part of a body. You are just a little cell. There's no such thing as being too close to someone or being uncomfortable because someone is basically breathing on you. In that moment  you just "ARE."<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nicetomeetnyaz Yes. they overshipped harry and Louis so much that it destroyed their friendship. Also I feel bad for her because she is the one being dissed all the time and called a beard. Couples are allowed to do things separately, they don't go everywhere together.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beautybyyakira @Zmasterp2000 She was awesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beautybyyakira @Zmasterp2000 The last line lol  https://t.co/ohsFIhwPB9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zmasterp2000 Belle could have left. She didn't stay because he got an extreme makeover. She stayed for that huge ass library.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zmasterp2000 Ariel did not need a prince. She just wanted to see the world. But if a pretty guy who is nice, has a cool dog, happens to live near the beach and is a sailor... Well that's pretty snazzy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zmasterp2000 Just reminding you Pocahontas also didn't need a man.  And poor 14 year old snowhite was kissed by a much older creep who thought kissing a dying child that was in a glass coffin with all her friends mourning her was a good idea. Happily ever after my ass. He just kidnap her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KerinCunningham It looks beautiful so far. almost ethereal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrickheadzX Yeah, and the x-mansion never exploded. Wolverine is a vegetarian and jubilee hates bubblegum. The only card game Gambit know how to play is go fish.

<|startoftext|>I honest to god want to start collecting #Barbiefashionistas. The dolls are pretty, a lot more inclusive than they used to be and I can create little outfits for then because I can sow. Plus there are always people selling tons of Barbie's clothes online.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Books make me forget that people use their bathroom for more than just sitting in their bathtubs crying or having the most luxurious bath. A mirror is allowed. The toilet doesn't exist. And if there's a sink it's because something sexy is gonna take place there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@inmycarradio It's the angels crying from being blessed with his presence. Or some shit like that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WIDEEYEDJOKER I assume it's like dying. Not dead but on the verge of death. The chapel is the place you pray for the miracle that saves whoever is hurt. It's a desperate yet hopeful love. It's the last thing they hang on to before letting you go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@addictwithaqen To me there's only one answer and Josh was barely there but I can't stop falling in love is their best cover and it fills my dark heart with so much joy.
