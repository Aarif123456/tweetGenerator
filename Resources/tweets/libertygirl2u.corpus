<|startoftext|>Thank you Sen. Judy Rosen who knows and understands algorithms.  Ask for accountability.  Can't decide if I want to rip Dorsey's chin hair out of his face first or his nose ring.  Either might wake him up! Zuckerberg is always "agreeable" and will say and do the opposite.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Sen. Lee quoting back to CEO's their own words.  They same one thing and then "flip" back and censor Republicans and NOT Democrats.
