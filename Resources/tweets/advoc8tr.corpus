<|startoftext|>@sfrrog @Shutecht @thekjohnston So...he had a black friend...that makes him progressive? I’m not sassing you...I’m just not surprised that he would have said such a thing. And he and Van Morrison are irresponsible a-holes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thekjohnston I had the same thought.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stonekettle @sarah_brens<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@radseg_cs @AdamParkhomenko We’ll agree to disagree. He actively pursued her and she was complicit, for sure. The fact that George forgave him speaks to George’s character, however. It says nothing a about a man who would betray a friendship the way he did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamParkhomenko I’m probably alone on this, but I’ve never really liked him. The fact that he stole his best friend’s wife, notwithstanding, I always thought he was a one trick pony, albeit a talented one. I’ll take Bruce and Baker any day over him.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SusanLovesELP Amen!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Buzzby48 @Gj68920763 @heyyou2486 @CCLcaribecrew He had nude pictures of her when she was, what, 19? 20? His girlfriend’s child.

<|startoftext|>@lector_caveat @Sarxis @WhiteHouse @joegrogan45 The reality is that the instances of children being prevented from expressing their religious beliefs in school are few and far between.

<|startoftext|>@lector_caveat @Sarxis @WhiteHouse @joegrogan45 For every story like that there are at least 20 more where children have been permitted to express their religious beliefs.

<|startoftext|>@soledadobrien I think the issue is that we are so disgusted with the lack of action that we aren’t really interested in semantics. I understand the reporters need for precision, but we’re beaten down.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@UROCKlive1 Honestly, we’re playing right into Darwinism: the strong (wealthy, powerful, often psychotic) are overcoming the “weak” (poorer, less aggressive, often empathetic). Do we need to evolve? Perhaps. Perhaps the “weak” need to rise up. Take aggressive action against oppression.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JimPok @MindyRosier @NShrubs @seanjohnwan @StephenKing Schools are starved into failure. We’ve taken life skills and removed them from regular education. Extra-curricular activities cost far too much for many parents to afford. School tax money is being diverted into for profit charter schools.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VP @realDonaldTrump #DeutscheBank #RussianCosigners.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jcgreenfield @NShrubs I can’t find any words to appropriately respond to this. As a teacher I’m horrified. I’ll never forget the day one of my sophomore boys told me he’d “take down” a shooter if we were in real danger. He was 15 at the time. It broke my heart that he felt he needed to protect us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast @RepMattSchaefer Ew<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenKamalaHarris But it is. Exactly who we are. We’ve built “America” on slavery and genocide. Can we change? Grow empathy? Possibly. But we can’t pretend that this isn’t who we’ve been all along. When we face that, we’ve begun to grow.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KatMcKinley @deppisch @BenHowe In my unprofessional opinion: Anything with higher number of “strains” is supposed to be good for you. I’d imagine something that’s refrigerated would be best, but I don’t personally think that’s a requirement, as long as it’s live strains. (Not meant to be medical advice.) 😁<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@frankbrinsley @AryaResists Let me be clear. I have zero pity for him - he has made every choice that has brought him where he is. My issue is the whole idea of making fun of anyone’s physical being. It’s less about him and more about other actual humans. 😜<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chick_in_kiev Still. Farimir and Eowyn (in the book) are such a beautiful couple. And in the text, Farimir is the only character other than Aragorn that is not tempted by the ring. What I’m trying to say is that it would have to be a foursome.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Lindag3333 @BryanDawsonUSA @mary13737 My husband agrees with you. He thinks the behavior is not appropriate for any legislator. I guess I get it, but it’s a bit disingenuous to think that people in the senate or house don’t use that language. Should they use it in public in front of constituents? I don’t know.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kenjilopezalt @Lollardfish @GordonRamsay Sorry - don’t remember the name. It was a small Italian place. I know he was relieved to be gone. It was toxic. I’d just been through 6 years with a toxic principal and we swapped abuse stories.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kenjilopezalt @Lollardfish @GordonRamsay My son worked for a (now defunct) bistro in NYC. Only job he could find, at the time.
