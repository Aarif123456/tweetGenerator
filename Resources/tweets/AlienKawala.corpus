<|startoftext|>@joeypsoriginal1 @StevePiccininni The fact that you asking me, draws a concern. If you up on the fence on who you voting for, I suggest Biden. For the fact Trump lied over 25,000 times in 4 years as president.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joeypsoriginal1 @StevePiccininni Bobulinski is attending Trump rallies... Come on, they have nothing on Biden. This is smoke and mirrors. How about Hillary's Emails? That she testified for 9 hours... Trump during impeachment avoided testifying. Who you gonna believe?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@joeypsoriginal1 @StevePiccininni He was making business deals with ukraine, kastan china etc. Yet no one knows what those deals were.

<|startoftext|>@sasQwatch_17 @toddzilla46 @MaryWills612 @ABC Trump downplayed the virus since march. Researchers looked at 2,541 patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 and found that 13 percent of those treated with hydroxychloroquine died from the disease while 26 percent not given the drug died. 13% yeah it's shit.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RNH00757249 @susiefreathy @Drock37 @iammix24 @RyanAFournier Is Antifa Violent? Members pointedly do not eschew violence but rather see themselves as engaging in "self-defense," protecting other protesters and primarily confronting neo-Nazis and white supremacists to deny them a platform to publicly spread their views.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RNH00757249 @susiefreathy @Drock37 @iammix24 @RyanAFournier Anti-fascist groups, particularly in Europe, have been around for many decades, notably in Italy, against Mussolini, and in Germany, against Hitler. In the U.S., the anti-fascist movements grew out of leftist politics of the late '80s, primarily under the umbrella of Anti-Racist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RNH00757249 @susiefreathy @Drock37 @iammix24 @RyanAFournier Short for "anti-fascists," antifa is not a single organization but rather an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups that confront or resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations.  https://t.co/y5flBWVZWo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ProFootballTalk He is entitled to his opinion, don't think it should be viewed as right or wrong. Just like taking a knee is a choice so should standing up be an individual choice. When the anthem is over we all stand together. Which to me still means we all American.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LyndaCouch4 @j_94smith @NYGovCuomo White people were looting as well. Obvious Racist!

<|startoftext|>@wbrunhofer You understand this was an attack on the protesters, with insurgents who instigated the looters and rioters to come out in drones. Antifa, Alt Rights combined. Who was labeled Terrorist? Don't forget the Trump Dog Whistle. Yeah we see you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OGKBEAR @Sumfuntoo2 @doctorzaius @pdxjeghan @Christa0003 How you think Trump is doing, with 50 million out of work losing their jobs and home and standing on lines at food banks? Has he said anything to them to give them hope and direction?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@weazry @OGKBEAR @zombiemilano @doctorzaius @Sumfuntoo2 @pdxjeghan @Christa0003 I was blocked too. he is an insurgent. Trouble maker.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gameon75069829 @pharaohfire @doctorzaius @Sumfuntoo2 @pdxjeghan @Christa0003 Trump isn't addressing, one of the major problems, he is militarizing instead of empathizing with the American people. Coming down hard when they need hope and direction more than ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gameon75069829 @pharaohfire @doctorzaius @Sumfuntoo2 @pdxjeghan @Christa0003 This pandemic, caused 40 million Americans out of work, many are struggling to make end's meet.

<|startoftext|>@doctorzaius @Sumfuntoo2 @OGKBEAR @pdxjeghan @Christa0003 Looters and Rioters are savages, stop it. The definition of a peaceful protest is peaceful.

<|startoftext|>@allgrafixx They aren't right in their approach. Protest is over you can't win like this. You are giving them more ammunition.

<|startoftext|>@deppresoexpres1 @shantall34 @WyattDobrovich Was this past curfew? If yes, should be inside. That would not have happened. You do realized by then it  looks like most protesters went home? If you caught outside past curfew and you underage you going to jail. They gonna assume you planning on looting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnonUpdates4U How about all across almost every state people are burning neighborhood stores. Most of that wasn't protesters. Outside agitators breaking windows causing chaos. We have to think this is bigger than one protest.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thejtlewis Interesting I respect your vote. How you feel when Trump gassed white and black peaceful protesters so that he can take a photo in front of God's Church while holding the bible upside down? He didn't inform the priest or left a donation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lockupbiden1 @gemisighs @GovMurphy Curious, how you feel that Trump tear gassed peaceful people during the day no curfew in place yet, for a photo in front of God's Church holding the bible upside down? He didn't inform the priest or left a donation?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gemisighs @GovMurphy Actually he should some sort of beckon of light in this grim of a weekend.  We need to stop letting hijackers, agitators infiltrate the protest.  Best way to win in November is to put protest to sleep for now and vote local and general.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KAFL2352 @gemisighs @GovMurphy I care about beer and women. We all need incentives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deppresoexpres1 @shantall34 @WyattDobrovich Few people got arrested it was pass curfew it went well they didn't attack they pushed them along. Wasn't Chaos so there is hope.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JG50581 @HalSparks Trump held the bible upside down, not just before he tear gassed peaceful white and black people so he can pose in front God's Church.  He didn't even leave a donation. Didn't thank the priest.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@my_little_rebel @ShredyBettyMTB @newsguz @DavidCornDC You get a like why, you have no clue who got arrested and why.

They are paid actors instigating with our freedom to assemble.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@my_little_rebel @ShredyBettyMTB @newsguz @DavidCornDC You only see that someone got arrested it is possible it was an agitator a plant someone who was suppose to start chaos, this is what they are dealing with.

<|startoftext|>@my_little_rebel @ShredyBettyMTB @newsguz @DavidCornDC After the other cities were hijacked by rioters and looters the protest lost all meaning. Made black people look bad across the world. This was a setup and they got blind sided.<|endoftext|>
