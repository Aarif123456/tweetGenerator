<|startoftext|>@marisalouised Not sure why you feel so compelled and take time out of your day to tweet me the Trump Cult talking points. If it's because you think they'll have an impact you couldn't be more wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedcruz Not gonna work. We know who's the president at the moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RudyGiuliani @realDonaldTrump How hard was it for you to translate this tweet from Russian?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GymJordansJack2 Here's something!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricTrump is also going to jail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandPaul and all the other sycophants crying like the little whiny bitches that they are.  Screaming at someone who is appalling at best is not assault.  Ask any women who experiences men getting a pass on assault each and every day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GReschenthaler @RandPaul do you do anything but whine?   Christ if that was the definition of assault, women would have the jails filled with men<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Who's going to be the Herman Cain of this ego driven narcissistic charade #TrumpIsALaughingStock  ?  I'm sure there's a Vegas Pool somewhere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump It had the worst ratings of any RNC.  Where's that DNA!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GymJordansJack2 Maybe it will be good news; like Rudy or Eric getting arrested :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump Disgusting; everything about this photo is disgusting!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouGarza86 Right here! I don't know how anyone other than Magats and media could!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KLoeffler @WNBA Here's a definition for you too... noun. The definition of Marxism is the theory of Karl Marx which says that society's classes are the cause of struggle and that society should have no classes. An example of Marxism is replacing private ownership with co-operative ownership.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KLoeffler @WNBA Oh Good!!!  That aligns with your soon to be canceled Senate seat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GymJordansJack2 OH NO!!!! Hopefully he has some redeeming qualities. Maybe a good granddad and dad to his daughter?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GymJordansJack2 Don't allow em to stress you. Stay away 4 you, wife and kids peace of mind  I read an article a few years back featuring palliative care nurses.

<|startoftext|>It's way past time for @senatemajldr  and the other enablers to tell @realDonaldTrump to pack his bags n GTFO out of the people's house!  @SpeakerPelosi you can be the one to secure the straight jacket.<|endoftext|>
