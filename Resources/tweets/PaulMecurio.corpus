<|startoftext|>#LADvsTB did anyone think the shot of the giant 🌭 on the grille was really disgusting? I mean I like 🌭 but  don’t need to see it on its way to the grille looked like a giant worm 🐛 🤢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes u DID say that on my show Michael. Ur candor is refreshing, I applaud u for trying to make amends for what you've done for that cult leader #trump.

<|startoftext|>It’s official - #trump trump is #carrottop. He’s working with props. This is a book that trump gave #LeslieStahl in @60Minutes interview claiming it was his Nee #healthplan but it’s a book filled with no plan and just various papers and executive orders and other nonsense.  https://t.co/X3nb4SkYuU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“You go back home to mommy”. #trump on @60Minutes trying to sound tough with #LeslieStahl  #pathetic #lieingcommanderinchief<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Nice comeback by @JoeBiden “republicans”. That’s why we couldn’t get more prison reform done. “ That shut up #TrumpMeltdown -  beautiful thing.  #Debates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great line. “You are a dog whistle as big  as big as a fog horn” from @JoeBiden  #Debates2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>.@mercedesschlapp Ur twitter profile lists "faith" first. Show some faith-based values &amp; convince @realDonaldTrump to stop saying #COVID19 is nothing to worry about &amp; he's glad he got it, that is going to kill people. Don't list "faith" and then be part of this murdurous admin.  https://t.co/bpZ1in1aJ3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If u &amp; Trump watched Mister Rodgers even a little bit u would learn compassion for others and not be part of the administration that's caused the unnecessary death of tens of thousands due to Trump's CONTINUED refusal to take Covid seriously. Trump isn't half the man Rodgers was.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>PROPAGANDA. HA.  Your cult leader trump is a serial liar. You don’t have a keg to stand on on that issue of lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Take that flag down you are not a real American if you can support a liar who is causing harm and death to get re-elected .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed. I worry he will cause a civil war if he loses. Bad guy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well keep supporting a liar who lies about a deadly virus to stay in power and acts like a dictator. He will turn on you as his supporter if you step put of line. you are on the wrong side of history supporting this incompetent monster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you. Glad you liked it and it home for you. Needed to be said<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1st I’m not a celebrity and if I were would that take away my 1st amendment AMERICAN right to not agree with your cult leader trump. 2nd “moron?” Is that the best you got. You should have ur liar Prez wrote ur tweets. Learn how to debate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you Melody I will post it and I’m happy it resonated with you. It needed to be said<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No I don’t hate Trump I hate he is killing people to get re-elected other than that I think he’s a wonderful human being. Stop trying to silence people who aren’t part of his cult like you. 1st Amendment is MY right too.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And masks are optional🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Must watch this. Puts it in perspective.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YES!!!  Get back soon cam. Go @Patriots<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @SusanPage I know it must be tough to be a moderator for the #VicePresidentialDebate but u were not strong enough with @VP and his constant snd rude flaunting of the rules by going over. Saying “thank you mr pence” over &amp; over doesn’t cut it. U were not fair to @KamalaHarris<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“Excuse me I’m talking!”  GREAT line from @KamalaHarris at #VicePresidentialDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why was the wife of @VP not wearing a mask on the stage tonight. Jesus! These people font get it #VicePresidentialDebate  https://t.co/2aoep4rZNi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@TheRealPenceFly found @VP so boring it flew off to hang out on a pile of shit #VicePresidentialDebate2020  https://t.co/ebXiY3sGOs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@TheRealPenceFly were you whispering answers to @VP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@VP had a fly on his head - fly through up with pence’s lies  https://t.co/XRNskOMjeO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@VP says “i am pro life” yes for the unborn but if ur out of the womb and could catch a life threatening virus like covid we r not going to tell you the truth and support masks putting all loves at risk and contributing to the death of 210k people. U better wish u were a fetus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It seems based on @VP going over on Time and @realDonaldTrump blowing through his time at the debate - no one in charge knows how to tell time in the Trump administration which seems about right based on their lack of intellect<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very nice slam by @KamalaHarris - on @VP  “@JoeBiden saved auto industry you voted against it”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Line of the #VicePresidentialDebate  “They’re coming for you!”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#VicePresidentialDebate moderator @SusanPage is not reigning in @VP and letting him NOT answer questions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah @KamalaHarris - “ if donald trump says vaccine is ok I’m not gonna take it “<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@Vp always looks like he’s doing a bad impression of a uptight insincere politician  #VicePresidentialDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look on face of @VP pence is “I really gotta defend this asshole trump? Here goes”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Softball 1st question to @KamalaHarris in #vicepresidentialdebate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Sorry good your loss. So much tragedy could hav been avoided- and u would hav hoped trump would c the light and not use his hospital stay to selfaggrandize and continue to downplay covid😢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey asshole, I've got covid symptoms 3 months after testing positive, chronic fatigue, joint pains, shooting pains in arms/egs, GI issues-STOP downplaying virus 2 get reelected! Ur a special kind of evil. If ur father hugged u maybe we all wouldn't have to die/ suffer at ur hands<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That can happen in Nov 3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People bitching there is no transparency about the @realDonaldTrump’s health. Wow. Shocking. This administration has been so forthcoming up to this point and so concerned about the health of Americans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heartless bully @realDonaldTrump is taking remdesivir. I am@told that is code for “bleach”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOW. After @realDonaldTrump tests positive for #COVID19 @MarkMeadows and @PressSec @kayleighmcenany STILL won’t wear masks. Guess you gotta stay on the boss’s good aide by getting the same life-threatening virus as him.  https://t.co/DbdaM7LTXx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>haha, exactly, "i beat it tremendously, the best beating ever!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Conservative radio host just said: "W/@realDonaldTrump having #covid19 NOW isn't time 4 politics." So was ok 4 Trump 2 politicize covid when he didn't have it putting US all at risk.

<|startoftext|>Yup-coming from our Fake Commander in Chief<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Thanks for retweeting everybody<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for the retweet man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>U might b onto something 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here is a BIG @realDonaldTrump lie to all of us. Btw I have #covid and am STILL DEALING with various symptoms because I was exposed to people HE convinced not to wear masks. No joke. This is a dangerous man. GO AHEAD bring on the negative hateful comments now to defend him.  https://t.co/uZV5dDKbTL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TAKING A POLL.  Based on @realDonaldTrump's test-taking history who do u think he's having take his #COVID19 test tonite? I think it's the "Fredo" of the family @EricTrump his only duties - making Chipotle runs for staff meetings can easily be filled. If not Eric, who do u think?  https://t.co/Pm1enGnvDJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anyone really think we are going to get an honest answer if @realDonaldTrump has tested positive for covid?  He has been lying to us fir 5 years. The answer is NO!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What did last night's #PresidentialDebate2020 between @JoeBiden and @realDonaldTrump tell us about TRUMP'S debate preparation?  Did he get some "special help?" Watch. What do you think?   https://t.co/jAJWMCF5qi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBigE_21 Omg this is heartbreaking as I hav a bucket of baseballs that I pitched to my son. I’m going to keep it for him to use for his kids. Thank u for sharing this-it really hit home ⚾️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is awesome!! Go joe!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To think @realDonaldTrump is President with the kind of abhorrent behavior and lies he displays and an innocent "in- the-moment" scream of excitement got Howard Dean bounced from the Presidential race in 2004. I miss the old days ...  https://t.co/68GGyZ02y0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My question is. How could anyone vote for this clown?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would like to see republicans criticize trump for his abusive behavior and sending a rallying cry to the “proud boys”.  #DoTheRightThing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why are people so outraged at @realDonaldTrump’s behavior. He’s been acting like this and saying these horrible things for 4 years. This is what voting for him got America.   #PresidentialDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t need another debate. I could just hit myself in the face with a hammer if I want to feel like I feel right now after watching the abortion who is @realDonaldTrump make this debate an embarrassment to the world.  #PresidentialDebate2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was insulted by @realDonaldTrump whining about how no one loves him while I am still suffering from #covid unsure of my economic future, my family’s future - he has NO sensitivity to what we all are dealing Wifh. Horribly self-centered narcissist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@realDonaldTrump’s refusal to condemn white supremacy. “Stand by” he said to the white supremacists. So I guess we have a race war to look forward to - so we got that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That behavior by @realDonaldTrump in the #PresidentialDebate2020 was like a child who needed a slap!  This was a Giant whine-fest by this guy. Chris Wallace needed to drop the hammer on trump. He is a spoiled child.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Horrific debate. @DanaBashCNN  love you. “That was a shit show”. Best line of the night #PresidentialDebate2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump on thin ice about 7 ballots in a waste basket.   #PresidentialDebate2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump looks and acts worried. He’s panicking. His bravado is fake and smells of a man who is losing   #PresidentialDebate2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump: “I spoke to the head of a forest city?”  Forest city. What is that? Is it a city in the wizard of oz I’m not aware of? Sounds like a scary place to live #PresidentialDebate2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump keeps saying the economy is back? Which one is he talking about. Russia’s #PresidentialDebate2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great line. He wouldn’t know a suburb is he took a wrong turn!”  Go joe  #PresidentialDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice points by @JoeBiden on race and trumps record.  #PresidentialDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wallace saying trump- you’ve been doing more interrupting that he has was great. Felt like a teacher scolding an asshole kid in school #PresidentialDebate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Thanks guys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #Debates2020 are overhyped.  While important they should not define @JoeBiden’s ability to govern. He’s been governing for almost 50 years. A debate performance against @realDonaldTrump does not and should not eclipse 50 years of service. Keep it in perspective.  https://t.co/DkQXTtXpp8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wondering why @realDonaldTrump thinks @JoeBiden should take a drug test for #Debates2020, if Trump will too and how the testing would work? I explain in this latest episode of #ourlongnationalnightmare.    https://t.co/ZJNjCHMoeE<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Great segment on @CNN today @SteveSchmidtSES  - as always you speak truth to power and do it eloquently. You are right. @realDonaldTrump is “testing the perimeters of what he can get away with” when he tweets the election should be delayed.  https://t.co/89X8KBMMUJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this is how people in countries that managed COVID-19 quickly &amp; appropriately get to relax-I’m so jealous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly-@realDonaldTrump just can’t make up his tiny mind-with all that space inside his head no wonder he goes whichever way the wind blows<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Looking forward to being on with my pals on @ChazandAJ on @991PLRFM this morning 9:30 est. I’m doing my air and shaving so I look nice.  Oh wait ... it’s radio.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I LOVE this very revealing chat w/@LauraPrepon - @OITNB &amp; #that70sshow about career, demands of motherhood &amp; her new book.

<|startoftext|>#Emmy winning comedian @LouieAnderson talks new book w/great stories about his mom.

<|startoftext|>.@NBCNews Chief Foreign Corr. @RichardEngel likens covering #pandemic to nuke fallout "threat has no brain, no politics, person is nothing to it except wet surface to stick to." Over 20 yrs experience hear Richard's unique &amp; insightful take on world events  https://t.co/2opCijquvB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ghartman02 I get that but with deathly pandemic people r being selfish by not wearing mask to protect others - sometimes doing things solely based on principle can b dangerous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>demand freedom from Tyranny, but pick your battles, lives are at stack and do not need to be sacrificed so you can say, "it's my right not to wear a mask." Do the right thing and keep your political powder dry for another fight down the road.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>your high horse about your "rights" - you don't want to be told what to do but you are fine telling me I have to let you put my life and the life of my family at risk so you can shop! My god, really! I don't have a problem you wanting to exercise your constitutional rights and<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>refuse to adhere and even complain that the authorities are being to draconian and you should not HAVE to wear a mask while shopping you are in effect telling people what to do, you are telling me and my family that I need to risk death so you can use the pandemic to get on your<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>it violates some contrived constitutional right. NONSENSE. You are putting others are risk of death if you don't wear one and you have NO constitutional right to do so. Ironic you don't want the State or others to tell you what to do but that is EXACTLY what you are doing, when<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is wrong with people. Why do they have to inject politics in to this pandemic. Why are people screaming about their rights re: wearing mask when it's in their and everyone's best interest to wear one. Some won't wear one and object to being told by the government because<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>awesome, reminds me when my son was that age and playing baseball, such a great time of life.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Thank you! This is a really fun interview with Cathy @CathyGwite you realize just how funny she is and how we miss her comic strip. Her comedy really gets to the heart of the matter!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>you're a stud man<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I think @Tribe_francona is a great coach for Cleveland @Indians but has he been eating too many sunflower sees, WHY take a starter out at end of game who has a no hitter, just 7 game in to the season? #HUH?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How bad r people's eyes, this guy looks NOTHING like @stephenasmith. Stephen A has more hair and is skinnier. Actually, now that I think of it they both have arms, legs, a mouth, a hole in either side of their heads (I think those are called ears), so yeah it is Smith.  #badcall<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@breadeatinszn @KingJames Look at this stat. We are 5th in the east. A weaker conference than the west.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CelticsDirect @apat246 Wow they beat the cavs by 10 points. Bring on the warriors!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey dude. Cut the crap with the stupid comments. If you can’t have an intelligent conversation stop Acting like a Six year old.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@apat246 @breadeatinszn @KingJames They play better without him. He’s toxic in the locker room. After a bad loss to the spurs the other night he actually said, basketball is hard.  He’s a pro. Stop whining. Plus he blames young guys a lot. This team is underachieved w/him at the helm this year because of his ego<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@breadeatinszn @KingJames One shot doesn’t put kyrie on the same level with king James and look at what kyrie is doing now with the cleats not what he did 3 years ago. Dumb.  Come on. You can do better than this all your arguments are lame. Weak fan. Know your facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@breadeatinszn @KingJames Grew up with them my Whole life and I’m right. Kyrie is bad for the team. “Seeding” doesn’t matter he said. If he said that while on Larry Bird’s team Bird would have kicked his ass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes that’s my point. So what. They are beating a 19 win team. We don’t win with kyrie the way we do without him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@breadeatinszn Y’all Take a look at last year y’all. Don’t ur your history y’all. Celts came within 5 minutes of going to the NBA finals over @KingJames WITHOUT kyrie. This year. We r seated 5 in the east with the nets gaining on us. Only ONE Difference between this year &amp; last. Kyrie y’all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My @celtics cannot win with @KyrieIrving he proves that no matter how great a pure basketball talent someone is what has a greater impact on a team is the ego and childish behavior of a “superstar”. We win depending on what mood kyrie is in. BAD leader. don’t resign  https://t.co/55T7Vq0Px7<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TomiLahren I don't think an "anti-gun agenda" killed 17 people, I think a gun did. Please stop using a horrific tragedy to pretend to be outraged about the left while in this tweet you politicize the shooting in a not so subtle way to press your own agenda.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I can't get off the ground st an airport with 2 inches of snow. And the country is in shambles politically. Who gives a shit about thread count. Are these sheets good for hanging oneself?  https://t.co/0lbf7QaCU8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On my way to @funnyboneomaha for shows. Hope to call in to @tntradioempire this AM but an hour delay out of Laguardia on @Delta - It's 2017 and 2 inches of snow and the system can't handle it!  WTF. You knew the snow was coming.

<|startoftext|>That's the adorable Kevin Brennan  https://t.co/NuraLKJG2z<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So true, sadly, so true ...  https://t.co/i37PJvM0uv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>hey @TheRobbShow looking forward to having you do a guest set on my show at the @TampaImprov this Sunday Dec 10th (you can give away some tix to that show too to some listeners). Hit me up via email tonight. Look forward to having you on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great talkin' w/comedian @kevinbrennan666 @NYCComedyCellar about getting hit w/a belt (not recently), his stand-up, his take on sexual harassment, being one of 10 kids &amp; more.  https://t.co/Z5Xu0NqwvD  https://t.co/qE0NAyPuSm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A lotta fun Jared. Cool audience.  https://t.co/C0IIslIUPz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haha. Excellent point. Toilet would work  https://t.co/DT8FNvzi89<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is there only ONE GUY fixing the turf at the @bigten championship game? Come on!  It's only a NATIONAL game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching halftime of @BadgerFootball and @OhioStateFB and this dude won $100k for tuition for throwing footballs from 5 feet away into a giant hole! There's a lesson for you kids out there. Stop studying, start tossing footballs into giant holes.  https://t.co/tsU3dZtXMo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>EXCELLENT idea. Do it in the public square. While his dummy son watches.  https://t.co/aciqkW9u1g<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. Lock him up. Only problem for @GenFlynn is they don't serve Russian food in prison.  Maybe @jaredkushner could sneak some in for him.  https://t.co/iUlzplIKTD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely. And throw away the key.  https://t.co/HxXy8Ta3cO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@GenFlynn and @mflynnJR ... STOP using your grandchild as a PR tool to garner sympathy from the public and prosecutors. You are so transparent and evil, despicable people. "Have you no sense of decency sir ..."  General, maybe you &amp; your son can room together in jail #lockhimup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@GenFlynn stop using "God" to soften the image of you as a lying asshole. Your statement today says, "my faith in god ..." it's total manipulation so people will think you are a god-fearing man. Dudes like you use religion as a PR tool to cover your tracks. Treason hurts  #felon  https://t.co/8ccSR8TznO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @realDonaldTrump I guess with #mikeflynn guilty plea it's time to "LOCK HIM UP!"  Hmmm, where did I hear that phrase before? Ohhh yeeaaah!  https://t.co/cSVMnlKcJD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I cannot take these close-ups of fast food in TV commercials anymore. Every shot makes the "food" look like someone threw up, ate it and then shit it out.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's a shame that @realDonaldTrump can't file Chapter 11 for being morally bankrupt. #election #PaulOnTrump  https://t.co/K7bjMXkbWX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@realDonaldTrump's shackles are like his taxes – you can’t see them, but  they’re holding him back. #election #PaulOnTrump  https://t.co/bat3dD9ccC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>caused his support among African Americans to drop  from .00002% to.00001% (2/2) @realDonaldTrump #PaulOnTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@realDonaldTrump said he’s glad the shackles were off &amp; he could  campaign how he wanted. The use of slave imagery only (1/2)  #PaulOnTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@realDonaldTrump said, “I know how to figure things out.” He sounds  Fredo in the Godfather... “I’m smart. I’m not dumb like people  say.”  https://t.co/2jqfpLhpiv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenPace hey there hope u had a good time at the show.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Fernands_Fans haha. So true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@realDonaldTrump says the election is rigged.  It IS – against  orange scumbags who grab women by the vagina &amp; call it  #lockerroomtalk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So far, not only has Trump not brought any jobs back from  overseas, he lost one for #BillyBush. #PaulOnTrump #election  https://t.co/Gl7wLLaDDh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@MELANIATRUMP  for giving a personal speech that has nothing to do with her own ideas. (2/2) #election @realDonaldTrump #PaulOnTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Attacking @billclinton for events that have nothing to do with   @HillaryClinton is like attacking (1/2) ... #PaulOnTrump<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#BillCosby apparently gets off on putting women to sleep which explains those 3 hour stand up sets he does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel bad for Camille. After the 30th woman came forward, do you think she was like, “hmm, maybe something is up?”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Over 40 women have accused #BillCosby of sexual assault. No jury will ever convict him. You’re going to need at least three jury’s.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BillCosby is the guiltiest man on the planet. He makes OJ look innocent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey guys, I'll be on @KennedyNation tonight at 8pm/EST on @FoxBusiness. Don't miss my pretty face!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This explains why whenever I eat Jello I get really sleepy and have no memory of what happened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BillCosby is so guilty they’re going to arrest Fat Albert.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where does a guy even get qualudes these days.  Those are 1970 drugs.  Those hideous sweaters are obviously the uniform for a time lord.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BillCosby has admitted to being in possession of quaaludes, which totally explains his terrible dancing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can make as many of these Jason Pierre Paul jokes as I want. what’s he going to do? He can't flip me off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@que0779 ha. How did you know!  It was hard getting him in there. Had to entice him with food.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I knew I should have brought my bathing suit!" #adogslife  http://t.co/v035eDk6h1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeoHainey ha sadly yes. Maybe wrap the injured finger in more fireworks. Dooh!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kierandill or the we stole and election wing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It could have been much worse. The firework could have gone off in his face and made him look like Eli Manning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Giants should offer him the contract but tell him he has to sign with that digital screen where you need to use your finger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jason Pierre Paul blew off a finger lighting a firework. People in Florida are like, “Just one? That’s lucky! Make a wish!”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At the announcement of his candidacy he hired more actors to cheer him than #JurassicWorld &amp; San Andreas combined.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump doesn’t like #Mexicans, but there’s one group he loves – SAG-Aftra...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m not saying his contract went up in flames but his first instinct was to grab it and hold it for 5 seconds too long.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jason Pierre Paul is lucky he’s an NFL Player. He can borrow a foam #1 finger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I live in New York so I’ve seen Pierre Paul play a lot.  He’ll still find a way to get called for defensive holding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only thing that firework could have done that would be worse, is trading Pierre Paul to the Jets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All I want from this case is #Gronk jumping up every 45 seconds yelling “OBJECTION!” and spiking his briefcase.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course, that would only be a 2 game suspension.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It makes sense for Tom Brady to appeal. It’s not like he was caught on tape punching the footballs in an elevator.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...making #Trump the only #Republican likely to be strung up with the #Confederate flag.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By attacking Hispanics, Trump inadvertently insulted both Ted Cruz &amp; Marco Rubio...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty sure Florida has a whole section of their hospitals devoted to this injury.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jason Pierre Paul blew off a finger lighting a firework, or as people in Florida call it: Tuesday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great #podcast episode w/ @bscottmcfadden! I bust his balls a bit, it's worth a listen:  http://t.co/rS60naKAmy  http://t.co/Nvq4RNLjvq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least he has teammates that can offer advice on this injury.  Eli Manning has played like a guy with missing fingers for years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m against giving a big money contract to a guy that gets the same injuries a Wile E. Coyote.  http://t.co/LLN2B4CQdZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know Aaron Hernandez is like, “Tom, let’s switch places.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love that Tom Brady’s mad he has to go to court to appeal deflate gate. Things could be so much worse.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Joe Namath claims he’s cured his concussion symptoms by laying in a hyperbaric chamber.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The bad news: Jason Pierre Paul blew off his finger. The good news? He now has a perfect four point stance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump urged his followers to boycott Macy’s.  Fortunately for Macy’s, the number of Trump’s followers range from 11 to 12.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Macy’s is not severing all ties w/ @realDonaldTrump – they say they’ll be using his head as a balloon in the Thanksgiving Day Parade.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump lost The Apprentice, but he’ll still get reality shows.  He has one coming up called The Amazing Racist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it any wonder #BillCosby was good on “Kids Say The Darndest things?” He was used to talking to people who were about to take a nap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tom Brady is too perfect. He’ll probably win this appeal and they’ll give him a Super appeal ring.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With all he has, why cheat?  What does he think, 5 Super Bowl rings gets you the free sandwich at Blimpies?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't feel sorry for Tom Brady. Up to this point a bad day is losing 1 of his Super Bowl rings down the drain during shower sex w/ Gissele.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump's campaign is nonsense, the last time someone spent that much money on a joke it was called “The #Entourage film.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not only did #Trump alienate 51 million Hispanic voters, he made sure he’ll never be able to order #Mexican food for the rest of his life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not if the joke is about him RT @fxlozano: @PaulMecurio Paul, too soon.<|endoftext|>
