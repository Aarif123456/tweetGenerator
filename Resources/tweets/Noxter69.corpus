<|startoftext|>Watching the trend throughout the day will dictate your decision to exit or swing. I also watch the buyer to seller ratio and pay attention to their movements. This can only be mastered with screen time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I then watch the first dip for the second leg up, together with time and sales for entry. If I miss the 2nd leg then I don’t bother and move on. Time and sales is critical here as you want fluidity and not a stagnant tape.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have had a few people ask me for my trading methodology: the simple answer is news catalyst and it’s got to be extremely good news not just whoopy dooo anns.

<|startoftext|>4.The overnite hold. Buying pressure in the last 5 minutes will dictate a potential gap up the following morning.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>1.The scalp. Buy in at just below match and sell off on the first leg.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Goldfin49614327 good work. Are you still in or have you taken profits?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>$OSP a pattern happening over the last few days. Get in the morning for a pip trade and get out in the high 4's. In the absence of an ann, dump down to the low 4's and repeat the following day. Just my observation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Goldfin49614327 I've got a few of those too. DXN and SDL are my basket cases...👎😠<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Goldfin49614327 Yep they call the shots. Are you in ADV? I bought in last Friday at 1.1, showing a bit of a run over the last few days<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Goldfin49614327 yeah saw that. I was going to re-enter at 3 but the status "processing" with Commsec scares the hell out of me...👎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Goldfin49614327 yeah. It's a frustrating one at the moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>$OSP consolidating in the mid 4s. Could do a nose dive like yesterday back to the high 3s / low 4s again or alternatively the consolidation is a pre-cursor for a run back to 5...take your pick...🤪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>$ADV could go for an arvo run to nudge 2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Goldfin49614327 do you know anyone that is already using it? Maybe get their opinion of it. I don't know anyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Goldfin49614327 Just checked on their website. T2 settlement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Goldfin49614327 I might try IG, I think they have one click ordering.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Goldfin49614327 I've had the same problem before with them. Which platform are you using?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>$AMT put in bid for 65 - order status was "processing" for a few mins, so cancelled bid...go figure 😠<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>$AD1 in 2.8 out 4.9 for a quick scalp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Goldfin49614327 Good work! It was a screaming buy and where was I...out a at Coles. Can't win them all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>$AMT completely missed the run<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikharaR looks like it might consolidate at the high 4s for today. GE term agreement may not be a game changer. High risk low reward scenario IMO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicSaunders6 just a correction mate. Still in, it will retrace back to the high 5s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Goldfin49614327 yep. I'd be happy with the low 6's for this arvo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Goldfin49614327 I was in the red this morning having bought at 4 last Fri. People are accumulating in anticipation of the GE term agreement due Tue/Wed our time. Momentum is certainly on driven not only retails but I think instos are in on it too.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MidasASX Both. I have the 1 min and 5 min candles side by side and the tape on the right of the screen. Develop a setup that is most suited for your style of trading. Not everyone reads the tape and think it's a waste of space.👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MidasASX @kickass_trader With breakouts I buy and sell at market. In the past I have missed opportunities setting buy /sell limits, only to see the price increase multiple times or it dropping to diminish my gains. Reliable net connection and trading platform is critical.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>$LCT on the watch list it goes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>$OSP missed the 3.6 support. Don't normally hold over weekend, but I'm long at the second support of 4 and lets see what GE can bring to the table.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>$ADV price weakness now, could retrace back to 1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>$SKN anyone decipher the latest ann?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tefliua Correct. If I miss the initial run then I scalp at market on the second step. Unfortunately there is no time to read support when scalping, just read candles. I have both the 1 min and 5 min candles set up side by side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kickass_trader I have done the same in the past, setting the stop at too low a margin only to see the price amplified multiple times. If there is momentum then I just let it ride and jump ship at market. Good trade for you too. HAGW<|endoftext|>
