<|startoftext|>@GrunwaldSpier It is also a verb. The past tense is homed as is the past participle. Generally used for birds who migrate to a new habitat or return to a previous one.

<|startoftext|>It has been a very sad week. We took in 6 puppies. The owner gave them wormer for adult dogs that was out of date by 2 years. Sadly 2 of them died  the other 4 Tigger, Theo, Tara &amp; Trudy are on drips in the vet😰Our bill so far is €1k for their vet care.  https://t.co/t6yTSrN4IF  https://t.co/5RXf2onYhx<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@salliduvain No we have dogs who have been adopted to the UK and to USA. Puppies must have reached 14wks before they can get a rabies vaccine though and then must wait another 22 days before travelling<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SarahMurphette @LeanneWoodfull Mine are the same they just love to be with us. It's so frightening for them in the pound particularly when they've spent 12 years in a home they don't know what's happening<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@canisgallicus Thanks Michelle. Yes it is more difficult to find a home for the oldies cause they're not as cute as the younger dogs but you're right they still have so much to give and are so loyal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dr_A_Kelly Great news long overdue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahMurphette @LeanneWoodfull I know. They were picked up by the dog warden and when their owner was contacted they just said they no longer wanted them and left them there in the pound. It beggars belief<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeanneWoodfull I know it's just shocking. They gave 12 years of their lives to their owners and now get abandoned. The poor chocolate lab only has 3 legs 😥<|endoftext|>
