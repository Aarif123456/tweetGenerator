<|startoftext|>@martynpool It's not looking good now is it?!! I like him though. Talks a lot of sense but the novelty as warn off with his team!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BFCStretch @barnsley I bet mate. The sooner we are back at games the better. Definitely picking up points from games we would have lost last season though! 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarnsleyFC Best signing we made. Love him. #barnsleyfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BFCStretch @barnsley Were you there today mate?! Great result.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy days!! #barnsleyfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JodyShelley86 @BarnsleyFC Will you give up!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stoobyleelaa @w4keysenior Cheers mate. And to you! What's your prediction?!! #barwed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davies_jaiden09 Just got back home from my lads footy training and could hear the music coming from the ground! ☹️ Can't beat a game under the lights. #barnsleyfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imagine having to swab a lion!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In my opinion the greatest sports commentator ever. #RIPPeterAlliss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BFCStretch @BarnsleyFC How did I miss that?!! Cheers mate. 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarnsleyFC Nope. Not yet! Made myself go cross eyed a few times though!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OriginalGMac @OTESportsGB White cap levels of investigation!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JodyShelley86 I thought he'd have played Matty James tonight mate for that reason. Can't gift any team two goals though and expect anything from it. 🤦🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby @BarnsleyFC @SkyBetChamp Forgot to turn up mate. Think the early kick-off through them!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Poor that tonight. Just not at it all over the pitch. Stood off and showed them far too much respect. Chalk it off and move on! #barnsleyfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A Friday tea time game under the lights! Pie and a bovril to warm us up!! Ooh yes please! @BarnsleyFC #barnsleyfc @SkyBetChamp  https://t.co/2pFdlb2fa6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@randomfilming Great photo Chris. Hopefully the baltic conditions will be a leveller! Our European contingent should feel even more at home!! 💪🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedsReport_ @CallumBrittain1 How on earth was he ever available on a free in the summer?!! He's been absolute quality. 👏🏻👏🏻👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geoffthetyke Switched off for the goal though Geoff! Another sloppy one to concede but great to come back and win. Just need an early goal in games to take the pressure off!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great to see us coming from behind to get the win. And The Bury Baggio making up for completely switching off for their goal! Attitude and effort is top drawer! #barnsleyfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get in!! Never in doubt!! #barnsleyfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@antclare78 I don't think Alex can do 90 flat out so freshens it up later on. I think Romal is more the type of midfielder he'd want. High energy and work rate. But then I'm on nights tonight so what do I know!! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Richarlison isn't as good as he thinks he is!! Bamford looking frustrated with being brought off after running his knackers off!! #EVELEE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simonlovidge @andymortby 😲<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In all seriousness though you should never trust a politician. Especially one that refuses to comb his hair. #coronavirusuk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Then why bother lifting shit now?! Honestly you couldn't make this up. Either we do or we don't!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OfficialFPL ⬅️ Out: Jimenez ➡️ In: Vardy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Robbed!! #barnsleyfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely love the energy and effort in this @BarnsleyFC team now!! All of them working their nuts off for each other! #barnsleyfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cross31Paul @BenWhiteman17 Not a chance mate. Still no fans in Tier 3 areas!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@campbellclaret Yeh but Christmas means more to most people!! It's just a joke. Why are we bothering now. We might as well just crack on and what will be will be. #pisspoor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior @stoobyleelaa I was thinking more to do with technique!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stoobyleelaa I know mate. That's the second double hit I've seen this weekend. To be fair though these featherweights aren't like you! When that right foot was planted it was planted!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does every game on the BBC feel like a 3rd Round FA Cup tie?! @BBCSport #FULEVE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stoobyleelaa There speaks the voice of experience!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some divorce inducing list of live footy on the old gogglebox today. Lunchtime game on BBC then 3 live games on Sky!! Followed by a night in the doghouse watching the NFL!! #SuperSunday I think all of that would test even @Zoster79 patience!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Iwobi has been taking the piss down that right side for Everton. #FULEVE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J_Mei21 Yeh but he'd forgotten he'd done it. 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't get how Peps job at City is suddenly  being called a rebuild job. He's the one that's been signing the players for the last 3 years. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyBetChamp The little magician @Callum_styles10 for @BarnsleyFC 🧙‍♂️ 🚀 ⚽ 🔝 🗑️'s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a strike this is @Callum_styles10 Another @SkyBetChamp goal of the month contender!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior @BarnsleyFC I've got one of them and sadly can't get any nearer!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PepePoo2000 Has Callum Brittain been on this list in every game he's played since he signed?!! Consistent quality. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chris_kammy What did you think Kammy?! Great game but better result!! #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So close yet so far away!! Wish we were there in the rain today! Come on @BarnsleyFC #YouReds #bfc  https://t.co/0q1DZokH9d<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chris_kammy I just thought they'd opened Westgate back up!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cross31Paul @DRFC_ITEN You quoting Brian Clough nowadays old lad?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Well maybe he should practice what he preaches and stay away from people! #SocialDistance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarnsleyFC  https://t.co/Zr9jKSvpFj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martynpool A lot more than was ever necessary mate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not bad considering he should have been hung until his head detached 40 years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarnsleyFC It's an even better finish from that angle!! Great strike @Victor_Ade_9 👏🏻👏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alex_mowatt Absolute belter Alex!! Gutted we weren't there to see it live! 👏🏻👏🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#LestWeForget  https://t.co/f08OHdTM4f<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not convinced there wasn't a little bit of luck involved!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JodyShelley86 @LaticsOfficial Teams like Barnsley!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How long does it take to count pieces of paper?! According to the news some of the remaining states have been at 90 odd percent complete for 36 hours! And now they're talking about recounts!! #USElection2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stoobyleelaa This needs Trumptons face on it. Superb!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I must be counting the wrong thing then @SchmoKelly I've gone with this! 🤷🏼‍♂️ https://t.co/k8g1k4Oc1b<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Can somebody explain how Biden only needs 17 more votes to win and get to 270 when by my maths there's still 182 to play for?!! #USElectionResults<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some of these #Trump supporters on the news!! What utter shite they are coming out with! #ElectionResults2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My 10 year old lad wouldn't leave somebody on his own like this! That's appalling! #shocker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JodyShelley86 @BarnsleyFC In #lordschmidty we trust!! Poor tonight mate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always good when an ex-player plays against you and shows you what you're missing and desperately need!! #kieffer ☹️ #barnsleyfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been miles off it tonight. Looked shattered. Not enough depth in the squad if some are missing and sadly we've got a few out. Another performance from @jackwalton23 On to the next!! #barnsleyfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dougokane88 Decent option though later on! At least he's be a physical nuisance! 🤷🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OriginalGMac He doesn't have to announce it 3 days before he takes it to Parliament though. 'Leak' or no leak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How many days have been wasted between an announcement from @BorisJohnson being made and the crux of that announcement being implemented?! #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has anybody noticed that these graphs showing the increase in everything also directly relate to the increase in how shit the Government have been?! #COVID19 #CovidUK #Lockdown2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alex_mowatt Screamer. Winner!! #boom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyBetChamp No contest. @alex_mowatt top bins strike for @BarnsleyFC 🙌🏻🙌🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JodyShelley86 Absolute class mate and has resulted in Mowatt getting back to being Mowatt!! Great performance today!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get innnnn!! Massive!! #barnsleyfc #YouReds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big crowd today at Oakwell! Everybody has got everything crossed!! #barnsleyfc #YouReds  https://t.co/zrwoPwfiyk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can just see the difference in @alex_mowatt now that he's got some quality beside him! And Matty James is just class. #barnsleyfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby @htafc @SkyBetChamp @MillwallFC @DemeacoDuhaney @nabysarr @Lewis_OBrien98 @pritch_93 Uh oh he's gone in early today!! #pma<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarnsleyFC In Schmidt we trust!! #lordschmidty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior I'd just seen that and was sat shaking my head!! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not Bobby and Nobby. ☹️ This year can fek right off! #RIPBobby #RockOnTommy #ripnobby<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc @IGN I still like a disc mate!! #oldskool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simonlovidge @andymortby @htafc Playing well from what I gather?! 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had a hand / foot in some belting own goals in my time but this is a great finish!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simonlovidge @andymortby @htafc Must be losing again if Mortby has piped up!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Matthew rocking his new @barnsleyfc goalkeepers shirt with Oakwell in the background. He's a big fan of @jackwalton13 and his new top!! #barnsleyfc #birthdayboy @ Barnsley  https://t.co/DIdzgI3sA9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get in!! #YouReds #barnsleyfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know what Lamela wants!  https://t.co/MRRZiLDJNd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CWRyder I use these mate and have my PS4 plugged into it with an ethernet cable. Much more stable connection!  https://t.co/zTwo2ylFXv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martynpool  https://t.co/sOMdnCXbvo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dougokane88 Was that in reference to the service he's been getting until that chipped ball for his goal?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OriginalGMac Just seen that. Money to money!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They have no shame and no connection with the general public they are supposed to represent!! #shocking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I should've save the United Chelsea game for @BBCMOTD Would've helped me sleep!! #boring<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby 😬 🟥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarnsleyFC At least half of those he's had fans in bits but has kept on plugging away and is turning into a quality defender! Well done @MadsJuelAnders1 #barnsleyfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@valerien_ismael @BreatheBarnsley @BarnsleyFC Can't be easy leaving family behind! Safe flight and hope you enjoy the game if you're there! 🤞🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cross31Paul Me neither mate. Played at Bayern Munich and at Palace in the Premiership apparently. Not a clue! Surely the law of averages suggests one of them will come off!! 🤞🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cross31Paul Or he might be the next Special One and we'll be in the playoffs come whatever time next year the season finishes!! This 🍺 is still half full!! 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fez031075fez Haha. I'm not convinced @BFCStretch can do that accent! Seriously though mate, have I missed something with the Austrian Bundesliga being rebound as the producer of great managers?!! 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who??!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@josephbeardsall I'd prefer him over another unknown coach from the continent. I'm not convinced another month of a manager getting to know the squad is what we want! Any news on who the third party is on the list?! #RedAllOver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saying that though it's a good job @js_browny hasn't learnt to finish since he left!! 😉 Must have been a strange feeling playing against his old mates though! #barnsleyfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After the two performances last season against I'd have taken a point but can't help but feel that's 2 points dropped! I thought @CauleyWoodrow was superb tonight and a great debut by @CallumBrittain1 #barnsleyfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CWRyder I didn't think we'd score 2!! 🤞🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on boys!! #YouReds #barnsleyfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anybody else think the sacking of Graham Alexander was odd?! Like he's off somewhere else but they decided to 'sack' him first! #barnsleyfc I'm still going with Hannes Wolf being announced this week though!! What's the latest @dougokane88<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Controversial opinion / thought but when everybody is fit does Mowatt start?! Does he need a rest?! Palmer looks good and gives energy. Kane looks comfortable on the ball and hopefully James will pick up where he left off!! #barnsleyfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on Reds!! #barnsleyfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simonlovidge @BarnsleyFC How was your window mate?! Did you manage to get Nugent in before the deadline?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well the mood around @BarnsleyFC feels much better after yesterday. Especially on here! In the majority anyway! Only 4 games gone and still a long way to go but a massive run of games coming up! Get a result today and we'll go on to make the playoffs!! 😂😂 #barnsleyfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BreatheBarnsley You've heard wrong mate it's Gerry Taggart he's fetching back!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will we ever totally get rid of Covid-19?! Regardless of what we do as a nation other countries won't do the same or aren't able to do the same so as soon as people start travelling again it will be back! Winter flu went worldwide in 1918 and its still here. #CovidUK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TotalBarnsley  https://t.co/uIPJTawEyh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby @htafc Another striker would make it a great day! A big lump up top to rattle a few.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby @htafc Leaving it late old lad! We've not got everything we need but I'm much happier!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get in @CauleyWoodrow you little beaut!! #barnsleyfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dougokane88 There we go. The old undisclosed!! 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedsReport_ Well that can't be right cos that fee is clearly disclosed! We only deal in undisclosed fees!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's the day! At least 3 new signings and nobody leaving!! I'm up and at work but still dreaming! 🤞🏻#barnsleyfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BFCStretch @fez031075fez @dougokane88 Are we still talking about boots?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tick tock. Time stands still for no man #barnsleyfc Let's go crazy and sign a few tomorrow before the #transferdeadline<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fez031075fez @dougokane88 Can't be that desperate yet mate! It's getting close though!! 🤦🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dougokane88 Not been on here all morning but this one text answers my question for the day. No new signings!! **insert shocked face. ⏰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior Cantona for me mate. He'd sit the keeper on his arse and tuck it away no problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is going on here?! Indoors sat side by side. Yet we can't go to open air stadiums to watch the footy?! #ffs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it just me or does the Government have no idea what they're doing?! Just making shit up constantly! #covidbriefing #coronavirusuk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexdowsett New routine!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not convinced @RoyalThighness_ was watching! Either that or we need a welfare check!! #stesslevels<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Take a bow @alexdowsett Awesome ride!! #Giro2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Connor__OC It is mate. Its happened here for years. We've had some real quality go. All about the money I'm afraid! I'll be amazed if we don't lose at least 2 before Friday!! All the best for the rest of the season anyway! 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Connor__OC Sounds good mate. A lot of ours are moaning that we could have had him for free 2 weeks ago but we didn't need a RB two weeks ago!! And any football fan knows that feeling of losing your best players. It's awful! I'll be glad when the window shuts! 🤞🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Connor__OC We will Connor! 👍🏻 What can we expect?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder if the accountant gets to know what the undisclosed fees are?!! #barnsleyfc #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PepePoo2000 We can't moan about the lack of signings and not be anything other than excited when we do! Until they play of course then opinions might change!! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarnsleyFC @MKDonsFC Welcome @CallumBrittain1 All the best for the future! Don't forget to sort your Twitter profile out!! 😂😂 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see the virus is having another weekend off before further restrictions are brought in on Monday! It's so accommodating. Probably a good job really with our decision makers. #COVID__19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeironDyson To the theme of the Okey Cokey?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeonWobYP From when?! When he tested positive or now, months down the line after the FA have dragged their heals?! I'm not condoning anything but how long does it take?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drennie180 @bfcsocial Deep breaths mate. It's called satire!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TotalBarnsley It'll be after the EFL transfer deadline that is for sure!! And probably a few more players light!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterKn22192630 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@antclare78 🤫 For now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gutted to see him go. All the best Gerhard. #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarnsleyFC Thanks for everything Gerhard. Let down badly by the club. Good luck with everything going forward. 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UnitedStandMUFC Local taxi firm back to the airport.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martynpool @BarnsleyFC Same old story mate. I think if he'd got a few players in and supported he'd have stayed. He had a bit of a rant after the game on Saturday that confirmed things but nothing official yet! That'll be tomorrow's cheery news! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martynpool @BarnsleyFC Through choice mate. Been offered the New York Redbulls job and has not had financial support he was promised regarding transfers! Tough decision though! T'arn or Manhattan!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@josephbeardsall Who would you sign Joe?! A realistic Reds signing if there is such a thing!! #RedAllOver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Obviously @BarnsleyFC were never going to sign any names today given that the manager leaving is imminent. I just hope they've got a replacement lined up who can get a couple in before the #EFL deadline next week. #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dougokane88 Not quite the news we are waiting for Doug but apparently a really good lad and great prospect! 🤞🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfcsocial I'd take him but this is never going to happen!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't help but think United are letting a better defender in Chris Smalling leave the club than the shower they have 'playing' at the minute!! #DeadlineDay #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TotalBarnsley Has that been mentioned?! That would be a result! Gutted to see him go but like you say he was never ours anyway! #barnsleyfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TotallyMUFC I take it you had the commentary on mute today and missed the club moaning this week about what Nev has been saying recently?! Have a word with yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedsReport_ Probably the most technically gifted at the club but his work rate is poor. Very skillful but can you afford to 'carry' one in the hope he produces! 🤷🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCSport Jobcentre?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc New left back done apparently and the oldest striker in the league obviously!! Cos that's just what they need!! 🤦🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I played in better defences than United's at the minute! And 17 minutes in huffing and puffing we were about as fit as this lot are! #woeful #MUNTOT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cineworld Gutted. ☹️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevenhartley67 @UtdBeforeFergie @TheWillieMorgan @YesterdaysStars I once got sent off for that. My only ever red! To be fair though the ref was a "Fkin prick" as well!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Martindevaney1 📝<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BFCDrinkers Some European bloke at the top of another obscure league in the back of beyond will want it mate when he reads the email!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BFCDrinkers Walton injured apparently?! 🤷🏼‍♂️ No idea why he's playing Ritzmaier over Odour and the Adeboyejo sub was definitely a dig at the board!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it's fair to say that this confirms Struber is New York bound at some point this week! Fair play to him though for speaking out! Imagine what you could buy with 1%  of this!! @BarnsleyFC #YouReds #bfc  https://t.co/xMfxddGaMW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CWRyder Do you think it's Struber proving a point?!! #strikerrequired<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CWRyder Why the change today?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That feeling when you concede and know that the chance of even a point has gone because you won't score unless there's an own goal!! #ffs @BarnsleyFC #strikerrequired #YouReds #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby @htafc Whatever it is it's duplicated South of the border!! Useless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martynpool Nothing should ever be an odd number mate. Nothing! Ever!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theearlofheming @robstaton @BBCLookNorth I know mate. Thought he'd gone at the weekend but still ongoing apparently. Same old story!! ☹️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I bet the Scousers are quaking in their boots again this season!! #PremierLeague<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeonWobYP If he's off to NY, I bet he's some poker player!! I hope he's not but think the apparent lack of backing might seal the deal! 🤞🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeonWobYP It's an attacking bench Leon that is for certain!! 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing against the lad but glad he's dropped Ritzmaier today! It's just not happened for him yet. Can't argue with the starting line-up today. Early goal would be nice. Any goal would be nice!! #YouReds #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMattLucas has just smashed the best opening link of any programme this year!! #BakeOff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CWRyder That's a very open statement Chris but it does fit most current scenarios!! 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So a stitch in time saves nine and he's found some extra Bobbies from somewhere!! Great news. #covidbriefing #Boris<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can anybody explain how this is an obvious goal scoring opportunity?! No way is he getting to that before big Jack! Shocking decision. #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PepePoo2000 Until red!! Quality! 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on Reds!! #YouReds #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@josephbeardsall Get on this @JodyShelley86 You might as well convert too @simonlovidge &amp; @andymortby Only a matter of time before you've had enough!! #YouReds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@josephbeardsall Done Joe!! 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see the Coronavirus is having the weekend off again. New restrictions from next Tuesday!! Why can't they implement things straight away?! Lockdown is coming. Cannot wait! #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JodyShelley86 And only a tenner to park!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JodyShelley86 Should park up at ours mate and walk in with us! Only 20 minutes door to turnstyle!! And yes it is ridiculous!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarnsleyFC I would hope so to be fair!! 🤦🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior @SkySportsNews And George Best was your hero?!! 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby Don't you start!! You jumping ship soft lad?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCSport And Liverpool?! What's happened with them?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@josephbeardsall Everybody looks good on YouTube Joe!! Let's hope he's a good signing and hits the ground running. Not sure I can handle another defender with promise bedding himself in! I'm also a big fan of Halme and would like to see him get more game time. We will see! #RedAllOver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OriginalGMac Yeh I'll stick with my deception mate!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are we acting now or from Monday?!! 🤷🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another player sold by @BarnsleyFC for an Undisclosed Fee! Is this so that fans can't moan about how much is then reinvested cos they have no idea how much is in the bank?!! #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@js_browny All the best Jacob. Always showed a great attitude and work rate! Good luck in the future. 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does somebody want to talk me through how you stop social gatherings of more than 6 people in pubs?!! #coronavirusuk Clearly imposed by people who think all pubs are little village establishments with people sat round tables! Not city centre bars rammed with drunken idiots!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeamLouieGeorge Aw bless him. That's amazing. 💙<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You'd best have a walk up to Clifford Court @simonlovidge and check on @andymortby Another Saturday night ruined!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc Decent that mate! Adidas are way ahead of others at the minute! Shame about the badge obviously!! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got to start with a bit of confidence! #YouReds in the 90 minutes!! 🤷🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosemarino @IAmChrisRamsey You're welcome Rosie. I'm not going to lie, it's the Mysteries keeping me coming back for more now!! 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't believe I've listened to 79 episodes of #ShaggedMarriedAnnoyed with @IAmChrisRamsey and @Rosemarino I've never committed to something for so long that wasn't visual! 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby @htafc Almost a full day without a moan!! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarnsleyFC Great news but a bit slow @BarnsleyFC My lad got @Callum_styles10  to sign last November!! 😂  https://t.co/GJsFypZ1A8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martynpool @McClellanLufc @TrevDon Easy! I'm already in training on my own at Ossett!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BFCDrinkers Wait till some of us are sat in the away end at Oakwell getting to experience that driving rain in the middle of December!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OriginalGMac I think you'd suit the full yellow third kit mate!!  https://t.co/lGBejRZRqu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cross31Paul @DRFC_ITEN Poor circulation that old lad. Or gout! Either way it's an age thing!! 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@antclare78 Just missing the best transfer window ever!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well I was quite enjoying the @SquareEnix @PlayAvengers beta until I lost connection to the servers!! Why is Hulk always the best?! #AvengersBeta<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dougokane88 Good. 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby @htafc Never happy!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only good thing about being back at work today after 3 weeks off is that I got to listen to the @IAmChrisRamsey and @Rosemarino podcast! I save it for work journeys!! #ShaggedMarriedAnnoyed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stay strong Fabio. Wishing you a full and speedy recovery! #ForzaFabio  https://t.co/r6QoAh9Ucl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BFCDrinkers Yes mate. The old selfie! Gates are always open on the corner of the East Stand and away end when we walk out heading bsvk through the Dearne. Lad loves to get pitch side! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BFCDrinkers Watching the grass grow!!  https://t.co/NqMNsh1VFq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simonlovidge @martynpool  https://t.co/Yu8AOfQyCk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simonlovidge @martynpool I'm sure they mentioned 160 million for Brentford!! No where near as much for Fulham. Shocking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martynpool Apparently it's also the most lucrative match in world football! Just in case you'd not heard it mentioned before, during and after!! 😴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc Definitely mate. It's awful. Just hope we take advantage now and strengthen properly then apply the same attitude as the last month of the season to the whole of next.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc Cheers mate. Not ideal at all but I'll take it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As much as I would love to see Pinnock get promoted to the Premier League, I think I'd enjoy seeing Jansson in tears after a defeat even more!! #playofffinal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is that not a red?! #playofffinal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This drinks break thing needs to stop. I went longer than 25 minutes without a drink in the park with my lad on Sunday!! #playofffinal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tobysibbick @kvoostende All the best Toby. Really hope to see you on a red shirt again soon. 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Matt_Bailey1575 I was all for not watching it Matt but think I'll give it a whirl with a couple of beers now!! 🥵<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby Correct! Always read the question twice Andrew. You should know that!! A bit like FFP rules and regs. Always read them twice!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby Not one that you answered!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby 😴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CWRyder Are we bothered?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently no news is good news!! Where did the 4pm announcement come from?! Is it another deadline organised by the #EFL that they can stick to?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior @CWRyder Yes mate. Find out today apparently!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CWRyder Why 4 o'clock?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After the euphoria of of the final day, today is the day that the massive sucker punch comes and we are told that it's League One football next season! Only two weeks later thanks to the EFL's incompetency! #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BFCStretch @BarnsleyFC I read somewhere about framing your pics!! Thought I'd use the old lead!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just admiring the view out the front window this evening! Can't wait to be back watching @BarnsleyFC with my boy! #bfc  https://t.co/Cv7za6hmz8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc It's a special talent he's got! He unifies fans around the country!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarnsleyFC Are they in the shop to view yet?! I've not decided which one to go with!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martynpool They seem reluctant to enforce there own rules mate. I'm not confident we won't be swapping places with Wigan again!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And no doubt Wigan will have their 12 point deduction overturned or at the very least reduced! The #EFL are a joke!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Wednesday get a 12 point deduction relating to season 17/18 that will come in at the start of next season - 20/21?!! 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simonlovidge Oh. Quality player just lacks a yard of pace. I'd be sad to see him go! Usually summer merry-go-round though! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dougokane88 Why next season Doug?! I think Charlton might have a gripe! #EFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Matt_Bailey1575 Really enjoyed your commentary on the games after the lockdown Matt. Nice to hear somebody without an organisational biase towards the so called better opposition! Keep up the good work mate!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Doctor_Hutch Might as well just throw all the jerseys at it including the rainbow bands!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing better than @yeovalley lemon yoghurt! #beaut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OfficialFPL  https://t.co/kMeWXrtYrs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why are people shocked by the developing issues with Spain?! It wasn't going to go away overnight and countries have opened up borders and airports far too soon! #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So we should hand flown to Spain last Tuesday! Chose not to given the current issues! Couldn't get a full refund with @jet2tweets and had to swap out flights to next summer. How unlucky were we that we booked a holiday for the week and a half that flights will go! 😡 #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OfficialFPL My triple captain whose name I don't know yet!! 🤷🏼‍♂️ #FPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeniusMUFC Bruce &amp; Pallister!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stoobyleelaa @w4keysenior His days of interfering with water are done mate!! It'd be a Coast Guard job!! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stoobyleelaa Cool shot in underwater mate!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theearlofheming @BBCSheffield @footballheaven Superb! Why are all Barnsley kids just little old men?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dougokane88 A toss up between him and Styles for me! Both been superb!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geoffthetyke Probably a good job cos the gaffer loves him!! Some healthy competition now in that midfield. Styles has been superb!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby @BarnsleyFC I know mate it's ace!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Morning! Did I miss anything last night?! @BarnsleyFC #YouReds  https://t.co/StKJMS9p1h<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jackwalton23 Another great performance Jack. That save in the first half!! 🙌🏻 Superb! 🔴⚪🔴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cross31Paul @simonlovidge  https://t.co/lpvzsAAwQr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has anybody seen @BFCStretch since the kick off?! Is he still eating that kebab or did it get thrown about when the first one went in?!! ##YouReds #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Strubers interview on Sky! Full of emotion for @BarnsleyFC Got a bit of dust in my eye just as it started!! #YouReds #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely fkin superb!! Everyone of them! Totally deserved since lockdown!! Unbelievable! Get in #YouReds @BarnsleyFC #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>GETTTTTTTT I IIIINNNNNNN!! #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JodyShelley86 Got to get Woodrow on now surely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pinnock trying to help us out bless him! What did the ref think that had hit though not to give the penalty?!! #BFCBFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a strike that is @Callum_styles10 Get in!! #YouReds #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on then! One last effort and we'll be happy regardless! #YouReds #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tuney4 Unfortunately fight alone doesn't guarantee anything mate. Obvious where our problems have been although we've all been having a pop at the defending!! But yeh at least at we've shown a bit if we end up in League 1. And we'll get to go to Donny and Blackpool!! 🎉  https://t.co/510InPVvir<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tuney4 I know mate. Something needs to change! At least we are in with a chance. An outside bet but dafter things have happened! A lot of so called big clubs still not safe!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tuney4 Yeh it's not good mate. Up against it but you never know! 🤞🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OriginalGMac I know mate. It's disgraceful. EFL just hoping it all goes away as usual. It's not like it's been dragging on forever!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well today's the day! Do we stay or do we go?!! #YouReds #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watched #FreeSolo A truly amazing @NatGeo film about the unbelievable ability of @AlexHonnold Sweaty palms watching him climb #ElCapitan #wow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarnsleyFC How have I only just noticed Adam Murray go full The Rock takedown on @js_browny #SummerSlam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jet2tweets Already sorted thanks. Somebody rang us back and sorted it out! 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@antclare78 Do we think he'll stay / be allowed to stay ragardless?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby No I bet mate. Si just sent me the club statement. Load of shite that is!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby I think he's actually the main man. I think Bielsa tells him something and he just tells them what he thinks!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chris Hughton or Lee Johnson @andymortby Although Paul Heckingbottom still lives local!! #htafc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not convinced Ighalo thought he'd be playing after lockdown! Clearly been enjoying his snap far too much!! #ManUtdVsChelsea<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought @Callum_styles10 was superb again today. Rapidly becoming my favourite player! Behind Schmidt! Obviously!! #barnsleyfc #YouReds #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BFCStretch @BarnsleyFC Some wait years for a chance to capture such a thing!! Hopefully he'll take it on board or miss it out again on Wednesday!! #struber<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Matt_Bailey1575 Zero shits given Matt! Just ecstatic with the late late winner!! #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some don't like him. I'd like to see him stay! Either way you can't say he's not committed! Look at the release of emotion when the goal went in!! #barnsleyfc #struber<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TotalBarnsley A Schmidt winner??!! 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guydavies7 @simonlovidge And still pissed by the looks!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two wins it is then!! #YouReds #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guydavies7 You out of toilet roll again mate?!! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc He did mate. He'd be sat in a pub now with a little smile on his face!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc The only thing that was wrong with him!! Bless him!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I bet Clifford Court is bouncing!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@josephbeardsall Steady on Joe. Sexy is a bit strong!! I'm leaning towards white though I must admit! 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UnitedStandMUFC Who do I triple captain in Gameweek 38?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Swinffo It is mate. Some schoolboy defending at times with costly mistakes but even in those games we've created! I'm obviously biased but there's worse teams down there. Some so called big clubs who are shite! At least we won't have VAR to contend with in the Prem!! 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Swinffo Not good enough in the last third though mate. The business end! The stats before the game showed that. Top 5 in chances created. Bottom 3 in goals scored!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least the board will keep the quality kids that are coming through at @BarnsleyFC for at least another season. Far too early to be cashing in on them just yet!! @jackwalton23 and @Callum_styles10 have been absolutely superb since the restart!! #YouReds #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well. Not embarrassed. Just not good enough. Which ultimately will be the reason we go down! If we do!! 🤦🏼‍♂️ #YouReds #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CWRyder There's just nothing natural about it!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seasoned summed up in 90 seconds of action! #YouReds #LUFCBFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BFCDrinkers But not in the same way that Hull were the other night!! 🤞🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fearing the worst but hoping for a decent performance and you just never know!! Come on boys!! #YouReds #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CWRyder Can we play both?! At the same time?!! 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@missmorenab Hang on! You've just been kidnapped by that Francis fella over here in the UK!! What's going on?!! #deadpool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Morning @jet2tweets I filled out on online form last week to speak to somebody about flights we have booked next week! I'm still waiting for a call back?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thoughts are with Jack Grealish at this time. I'm really hoping his hair is ok! #nasty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PepePoo2000 @Barnsleyis That's a toughy. I'd be happy to see them all play week in and week out!! 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spitfire flypast over @barnshospital from the living room window!! #barnsleyisbrill  https://t.co/KIbcxxmQF2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby At this rate it'll be rock paper scissors. Everybody fancies League 1! Have they heard that VAR is coming to the Championship?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's like the longest most painful separation ever. If #barnsleyfc were a family pet somebody would have done the decent thing and put it / us out of our misery months ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come onnn!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big Schmidt winner!! #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was naughty as well!! #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BFCDrinkers Mowatt took everything until Odour had a run in the side. Now Mowatt can't keep Ritzmaier off 'em. And he's shocking. #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do not get what Ritzmaier offers. #YouReds #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Must win. Now or never. Come on!! #YouReds #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Williams and Ritzmaier on the left again. #YouReds  https://t.co/OZs91w80ge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So if I've worked this out right, Stoke beat us 4 nil and Leeds have just beaten Stoke 5 nil. Only logical result next Thursday is a 1 nil win to Barnsley at Elland Road!! #YouReds #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby @simonlovidge It's madness mate. Doomed but until its mathematically confirmed there's still hope!! Somehow! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BreatheBarnsley Half the problem is that Halme is the only one I've seen all season attack a cross and look.ike getting on the end of anything. Our strikers are waiting for scraps to land at their feet. But yeh the balls in are poor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's painful. It's torture. But it's why we love it! I fancy us to get something agsinst Leeds and Forest though!! 😂😂 #YouReds #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't get Jordan Williams as the left of 3 centre halves and Ritzmaier has done nothing since he came. He doesn't even look like doing anything! Another poor performance. #YouReds #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BFCDrinkers @BarnsleyFC Strange decision for me. Undoubted ability but not for me in a game like this! And I'm struggling to see what Ritzmaier offers / can offer!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fully deserved that Southampton! Really enjoyed watching that game for a change! Even though Pep had done me! #FPL I'm more of a play your strongest side then rest 'em manager but then again I don't get paid for it!! #SOUMCI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time for a hat-trick from #KDB 😂 #FPL #SOUMCI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OfficialFPL It's nailed on! Especially with this scoreline! 🤦🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do not get out swinging corners?!! #SOUMCI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@antclare78 @BarnsleyFC Shocking performance but this weekend could have been so much worse! Shit or bust on Tuesday now! #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@henryfraser0 Yeh but the economy is on the move again Henry!! Far more important. Not! Hang in there mate. 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pep at it again! I captained KDB - benched! VC - Bruno with 15 points set to become 30 until KDB comes on with 15 minutes to go and gets me 2 points!! Stupid fekin game! #FPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tuney4 @McClellanLufc Don't be!! Still all to play for in the shit zone! 🥴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc He's grown a pair since then!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OriginalGMac Are we surprised?! Are we fk!! Pubs were busy in Barnsley at 1! Before @BarnsleyFC gave us all a reason to drink!! 🤦🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reports of drunk people in pubs not social distancing!! No way! I did not see that coming! #4thofJuly #COVID19  https://t.co/L6b5d7O79P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that was absolutely disgraceful! And completely out of nowhere. It'll be a belter at Kenilworth Road on Tuesday night! 🤦🏼‍♂️ #YouReds #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby Here he is! Take him off Pol1 they've won one!! And yes mate we can still see you. We can see a third of the league in the quicksand around us!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just seen a Postman for the first time in over a week! Is the Barnsley sorting office back open?! @RoyalMail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@js_browny @BarnsleyFC Great finish for the goal but what about that clearance in the first half?!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LucaBywater7 @chloedale5678 Definitely. Different player now mate. The schoolboy errors just lead to absolutely no confidence! I'm really pleased for him!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OriginalGMac Petrol tankers!! 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LucaBywater7 @chloedale5678 If only Luca!! Are you Pinnock in disguise!! I like it! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SUPERB!! That's all we can do! Keep going. Onto the next! @BarnsleyFC #YouReds #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sollbauer is immense. A proper centre half! But who have they got wearing Andersons skin suit?! He's been different class since the lockdown!! #YouReds #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>GET INNNN Browny you little beauty!! @BarnsleyFC #YouReds #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on boys! Another big effort tonight!! #YouReds #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder if there's any units near Clifford Court can do a welfare check on @andymortby Have you heard from him @simonlovidge 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UnitedStandMUFC Shaw for Williams. He's too slow in his play and far too lackadaisical!! Makes sloppy mistakes constantly. Infuriating!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Even at my happiest fireworks can fuck off!" Superb! How do we get @IAmChrisRamsey to Prime Minister?! We need somebody proper grumpy in charge! #ShaggedMarriedAnnoyed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc @JoeCatling19 @EFL Awful mate. He wants two footing just above the knee!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeonWobYP @GrahamSmyth Circuit or circus. Not seen a good one at Oakwell all season!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeCatling19 @McClellanLufc @EFL I'm all for smashing Leeds but that's just disgraceful. Cowardly. Disgusting. #Mitrovic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc I'd quite like to see West Brom lose in the play-off final. 92nd minute winner to Preston! #shithouses<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chris_kammy Wear your lucky Yorkshire pants Kammy!! 🤞🏻 #nopressure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martynpool Exactly mate. Anything that is taxed we'll bend over backwards to get up and running! Stinks. On the plus side I can get my wig cut!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the brainless idiots desperate to get back to a pub can do that again from the 4th with zero chance of maintaining any social distancing yet my boys can't give their grandparents a cuddle! The same grandparents who haven't been out for 14 weeks! #priorities #pubs #<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProfKarolSikora Call me a grumpy old cynic but I'm going to suggest that with the pubs opening any chance of behaving sensibly will be gone!! Beer in, brains out!! #carnage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby I missed the first 5 minutes but it was fine after that!! 🤷🏼‍♂️#bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>GETTT IIIINNNNNNN!! @BarnsleyFC #YouReds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's happened to Strubers beanie hat?!! #YouReds #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on boys! Don't go down without a fight! Let's have it!! #YouReds #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby Same!! #ifollow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You'd think with all the fires in Pontypandy that they would have started an investigation by now. Especially at Mike &amp; Helens house! 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BreatheBarnsley That's some statement! The list for best would be much shorter!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc I've stopped trying to work it out mate. Wait till next week when we've got thousands gathering outside football stadiums. 🤦🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see Twitter and the News are joyous places to be again today! If in doubt or without a cause have a pop at the Police! #SaturdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeonWobYP I'm on days. Will have to finish earlier to get there on time!! Oh wait. iFollow at work it is then! #YouReds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's back @w4keysenior Might help you avoid relegation!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any chance of a link @BarnsleyFC for the new fixtures to add to my phone calendar?!! #YouReds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dougokane88 Any idea how we sort this out Doug?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I heard an interview earlier in relation to football restarting and the possibility of fans turning up at stadiums. Whoever was being interviewed said, well that would be an issue for the Police to resolve! Course it would. Every issue caused by somebody else is a Police problem!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that's our season tickets renewed regardless of league and fan participation!! 😂 Hopefully me and my boy will be walking to Oakwell to see @BarnsleyFC sooner rather than later! #YouReds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahMillican75 Happy Birthday Sarah! I didn't realise we were the same age! You look much closer to 40 than I do!! #happybirthdaytoyou<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@springvalered Have we got a decent dart thrower who watches The Reds?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BFCStretch All the best mate. She'd be coming up for early release now with good behaviour!! 🎖️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TotalBarnsley That's the way I see it! It's money we've already spent anyway. And I'd be happy to renew next season at a flat rate just to keep our seats! We love where we sit!! #YouReds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarnsleyFC Will the flexi ticket be for my seat?! Do I have to be the one who uses it?! I can't see how that would work if I've renewed my reason ticket! Surely it's a great chance to get others interested and fill other empty seats! #YouReds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OriginalGMac Sorry. Yep! I stand corrected! And now that I know that it throws a different light on things!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unless of course you happen to be a MP potentially with the virus taking your kids to another household to be looked after!! No double standards here. Oh no!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martynpool Yep! Bit of reverse psychology!! You can go out  now and get a job. No thanks I'll stay at home and play bingo online. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What are the chances if we were to end lockdown that the idiots who usually can't be dragged to work and refuse to leave their homes just go back to that?! Back to staying indoors and doing absolutely nothing. #todaysthought #Covid_19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stoobyleelaa What about Malone going on the Bulls bus to congratulate them after losing though! Massive respect. Rodman was just loving life. Madonna to Carmen Electra via Vegas!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just finished watching #TheLastDance Awesome documentary! Not sure MJ is human on more than one level but he is amazing!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkySportsNews Course he has. They're set to win the league!! It's hardly headline news!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@parkerpointer Great! Funtimes ahead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I didn't see BoJo on the tele box earlier. Did it make anymore sense tonight?! #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cross31Paul That's not you!! Has Mrs. C got her medal yet?! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@parkerpointer I hope that was an essential journey!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby @w4keysenior @SkySportsNews But true! It's like you can't work the remote! Just turn it off!! It's bad enough when they've got stuff to talk about!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior @SkySportsNews Well you &amp; @andymortby moan about it every day so that's at least two numpties!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lynz864 @Ryanair Yeh I'd heard about these vouchers. Not good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby Best avoid Insta then mate! We've had another barbie in the big back garden!! 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lynz864 @Ryanair Oh! When were you going Lynz?! It's a good job they're cheap cos they've got nothing else to offer!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Furious_Fergie Precedent set!! Happy days.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That's it I can't take anymore. They've put @TopGunMovie back till December now!! ☹️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkySportsNews What a load of shite! I don't think there's many people who couldn't breathe for 25 minutes that have lived to tell the tale. Or not woken up in intensive care. #scaremongering<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior @stoobyleelaa Still waiting to meet your other one!! 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stoobyleelaa @w4keysenior He loves me too. Especially when I'm delivering milk and biscuits!! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is anybody elses self-isolating parents getting bathed in milk?!! It'd be cheaper and easier just buying them a cow!! #CoronaUpdate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@revkatebottley You mean the film with the girl in quarantine in the Kingdom of Corona?!! #whoknew 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrumpySkeletor All from an acceptable social distance obviously!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby Doesn't really go with, "Business as usual"!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martynpool @McClellanLufc Are you being ageist or Barnsleyist?!! Either way 🖕🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martynpool @McClellanLufc I think it's safe to say mate that the way things are going people are going to have far more important things to worry about! Believe it or not!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martynpool @McClellanLufc Apart from UEFA wants the leagues finished by the 30th June and the experts have said this won't peak until June!! 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd love to self-isolate with the family and keep my distance socially but unfortunately I've got to go to work! #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simonlovidge Things aren't that bad!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stoobyleelaa I think it's the difference in class thing again! Just been reading a thread from a Doctor who has it at the minute but wasn't able to get officially tested yet sports stars and politicians etc can!! 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OriginalGMac Oh that's good. Especially with them keeping schools open!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OriginalGMac Makes the self isolation seem a bit pointless if people can have it without knowing and presumably carry on as normal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So #IdrisElba tested positive with no symptoms?!! That throws a spanner in the works! #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@parcelforce I'm fairly sure that for a delivery to be attempted the driver should be knocking on the door! And there's nothing worse than an automated re-booking system! #poor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think the scientists shoukd be looking at Emergency Service staff for the #cornoravirus cure because apparently they are immune! Absolutely nothing in place to assist and business as usual for Police, Fire and the NHS apart from washing hands more!! 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I bet #Andrex are loving this shit. As opposed to the usual shit!! #cornoravirusuk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior @tuney4 He's right though. Youve given yourself the vote of confidence twice!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dougokane88 Is that because the season is now over?!! Just voud it!! 🤞🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior I can cope with that if it involves no Scouse title, no Leeds promotion and more importantly no relegation!! 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surely if you're going to cancel football matches and other sporting events you also have to close down shopping centres, retail parks and sweaty nightclubs etc. Lets not be half arsed about! #coronavirusuk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No sign of @bignorms this morning on the tops at #langsett Goalkeepers never did like the wind though!! 😉 #walkingbrilliant #bignormsbigwalks  https://t.co/jAEJTULVPC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So footballers can't shake hands but rugby players are still sticking their heads up each others arses at scrums?!! And cupping balls it would appear! 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BFCStretch @BarnsleyFC Better ideas!! Poor today. No energy anywhere. On to next week! 🤞🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Would anybody miss it?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dougokane88 No they looked flat the last time they played weekend midweek weekend. Not making excuses but squad strength shows with games in quick succession.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dougokane88 They did the last time we played midweek.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Football is a much better game when you win!! #YouReds #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simonlovidge @martynpool  https://t.co/2R8YNvaYCD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dougokane88 I think the camera on the red button was 20 yards behind you!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martynpool It's a good job!! 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Massive!! #YouReds #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby Stay away fans?!! Didn't you cry off last week?! 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dougokane88 He had a great game but for me Sollbauer has made the difference! Always talking and encouraging! Just what was needed. That and cutting out the mistakes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get in!! #YouReds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BreatheBarnsley And they're all left footed!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is the point in a contract @EE if when it suits you just put the prices up?! If I decided to pay 2.2% less every month I'm sure you'd be well impressed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BFCDrinkers So frustrating! The ability is there but his work ethic has been shocking. Unless he was really up for it he was bone idle!! Shame really.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Full house for Georgie @w4keysenior<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simonlovidge @andymortby He was shocking mate. Clear foul right on the edge of the box. Then a deliberate handball for a penalty! Usual Championship standards!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby And performance of the week goes to........?! #YouReds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>GETTTTTT IIINNNNNNNNNNN!! #YouReds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haha!! Get in Forest! Fully deserved that! #WBANOT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby How has he missed the big calls today?! Appalling refereeing! And I don't know why we have linesmen! #WBANOT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarnsleyFC In this weather with our league position and recent performances!! #respect #YouReds  https://t.co/cGrzNPrQFJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dougokane88 He's got to start Halme with Sollbauer tomorrow! Andersens confidence must be shot and head frazzled! Contrary to popular opinion I think he's decent. Just out of his depth at the minute. Can't keep making the schoolboy mistakes at this level!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrentfordFC @EthanPinnock5 Miss him. Lots!! @BarnsleyFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maxwellpearce The 'One Out of a Hundred'!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@antclare78 @BarnsleyFC Not sure if it's right but I've heard Leeds have got a clause in his contract for any sell on fee! Well see. His potential is massive in my opinion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@antclare78 @BarnsleyFC I can't see Odour staying Ant but would have to agree! Especially after another amazing summer transfer window!! 🤦🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martynpool Oh dear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Win, lose or draw I love match days with this one! Two of the @_skybetchamp_ finest defences on display today!! 😲 @bfc_official #bfc #YouReds @ Oakwell  https://t.co/lMQm4bNxaS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PepePoo2000 I feel a bit for Thomas! We've got far too many left footers!! I think if he was on the left on his strong foot he'd naturally go passed a man rather than checking back inside into trouble. Styles looked good today though. #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How can you not like Chris Wilder?! The man talks some proper old school sense! Love his comments about the winter break this morning! And what a job he's doing @SheffieldUnited 👏🏻👏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gillinghamjoe A great big tattoo on your back of your favourite cartoon character!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirdWaza @BarnsleyFC @luke_luke19 @Project14DV @BarnsleySamari1 45 gone mate?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not going full doom and gloom just yet. Not until it's mathematically confirmed but anybody who has watched @BarnsleyFC this season knows that creating chances / scoring goals is not an issue. Stopping them at our end is! How have they not invested more in the defence?! #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislowe1989 I've heard that after the window the U23 teams points count towards the first teams total! So we'll be ok!! 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior @UtdBeforeFergie I know that. Can't remember you telling me about his Aunty and him being the reason you started going though! ! 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior @UtdBeforeFergie I'm not convinced I knew that!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UtdBeforeFergie 500 hundred yards from my back door. The greatest footballer to come out of Barnsley!!  https://t.co/jT3Baaoh3u<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martynpool @McClellanLufc He is mate!! Thanks. He won't make you as much money as Odour though when we cash in!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc Back off we need them!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Only1Argyle @crawleytown @SkyBetLeagueTwo Got to be the best shirt sponsor in the country!! 👏🏻👏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PepePoo2000 @Barnsleyis Halme - Holding midfielder or Centre Back?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martynpool Oh yeh I bet there was loads of that going off. Just awful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martynpool That's what we said mate. How did the ones carrying out the orders ever think it was ok or a good idea?! What sort of brain washing were they getting?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cross31Paul You're not wrong mate. And they were saying on the radio that at one camp the average time between arrival and death was an hour! You just can't imagine. Absolutely horrendous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've read today that if we held a minutes silence for each victim murdered in the #Holocaust, we would be silent for  just under 11 and a half years. That is astonishing. #HolocaustRemembranceDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally got to see @TheGentlemen today! Thought it was superb and arguably @realguyritchie best film! Really hope there is another in the pipeline and a spin off for The Toddlers!! #superb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Al_Cooper7 @GlovedManiac @LeonWobYP We do mate but times a ticking! I'd love an established Championship centre back and striker  but that's not going to happen!! 🤞🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Al_Cooper7 @GlovedManiac @LeonWobYP As poor as Andersen?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GlovedManiac @LeonWobYP I do too but he's also better than what we've got at the back! Pending the new lad finding his feet!! Loves a scrap but quality with the ball at his feet. If we get somebody else in then fair enough but at the minute needs must!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeonWobYP Struber clearly likes Halme in the holding role but for he's got to play at centre back for me. Andersen needs dropping / resting! Halme &amp; Sollbauer with Dougall in front. #barnsleyfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gailemms @adidasUK Beast mode reactivated!! 💪🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahMillican75 In one go?! Tangy!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dougokane88 Just fired Twitter up to find out who was captain Doug and this tweet was first up!! It's either weird or great journalism!! 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tobysibbick Good luck Toby. Come back stronger mate and get we'll see you in red next season. 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BFCStretch Definitely mate! It's beyond laughable now. Crying out for a no nonsense centre half! 🤞🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simonlovidge The pie was decent and we dropped on with a couple of large cookies. The rest was just unfortunate waste of time!! 🤦🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that was absolutely garbage. Shocking. You can't keep sugar coating that defending. It's worse than school boy. First lesson as a kid - if in doubt kick it out. It goes! No team can score without the ball! #YouReds #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby Clearly not performance enhancing!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby That's the rumour mate. After the game against you lot. 🤷🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby Boos are louder than cheers mate!! Absolutely fkin garbage!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on Barnsley!! #YouReds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BreatheBarnsley Can he see again now?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby Haha! Anyway pipe down. Code 4 here trying to watch Love Island with Lovidge!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby Most of the noise from you lot was you all having a go at your own players!! I'm sure I saw one bloke do 20 yards at the front into the corner to berate somebody! Probably Simpson!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby Sorry mate didn't mean to disturb your viewing! It qwas noisy twice to your once mate. That's all that matters!! 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby Watching it then!! 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BFCDrinkers I did quite like, You're Supposed To Be Shit, when we scored the first!! Made me chuckle!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where's Wallys?! @simonlovidge @andymortby Just look for the tears!! #YouReds  https://t.co/l5X467EsQt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby @simonlovidge Yeh you're right mate. Dragged us down to your level!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby @simonlovidge Haha!! Last time I checked singing didn't get you 3 points mate!! #YouReds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Give us a wave @simonlovidge @andymortby ⚽🔴⚪🔴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby @simonlovidge It's either in Pontypandy or Greendale! I can never remember!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simonlovidge @andymortby Good luck! Getting to the ground not for the game!! #YouReds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do they have @SkySports in Italy?! AC want Lingard and Inter want Ashley Young?!! 😲<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CamMcGeehan @BarnsleyFC Good luck at Pompey Cam. Still one of my lads favourites!! Hope to see you in a Barnsley short again soon! 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby Yeh I wouldn't go near the ground mate. Probably in town and a short walk but that's a nightmare at the minute with the level crossing by the train station being shut! Easier to walk from our house!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TotalBarnsley Looks awesome on YouTube!! Another left footer! 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IAmChrisRamsey Well it's about time!! Some of us have been working all Christmas with nothing to listen to on the drives to and from!! #letdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cross31Paul Do we care?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who's Scott Mowatt?!! @alex_mowatt @BBCMOTD @BarnsleyFC #bfc #YouReds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UtdBeforeFergie @w4keysenior In my favour or yours?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UtdBeforeFergie @w4keysenior Cheers mate! All the best to you too! I think the old man is trying to get his head around having a 45 year old son!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior @UtdBeforeFergie Never mind that! What about me?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PepePoo2000 @Barnsleyis Why not! Get Woodrow back up top where he should be!! #YouReds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@United_Memories @UtdBeforeFergie @SirBobby Look at the state of that pitch!! @w4keysenior can you imagine today's players on this?! They'd all want a full change of clothes at half time!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobbieSavage8 I see West Ham are the latest team to play out of their skins after the Manager was sacked! For me players should be fined 2 weeks wages if a manager is sacked due to poor results!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big sunset tonight!! #barnsley #barnsleyisbrill @ Barnsley  https://t.co/QshPMqUrWn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martynpool I'd best check mine then if there's a new update!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martynpool Christ what is it?!! And have you still got AOL dial up?!! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BFCDrinkers Another belter today!! 🤦🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cross31Paul Don't get me wrong mate. Made 4 superb saves! Kept them in it. He's the reason they scraped a point!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BFCStretch @BarnsleyFC I'm coming for your job mate!! Couldn't resist checking out the pitch after the game today! #veryarty 😂  https://t.co/yYQgkZHas6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>West Brom got exactly what they deserved today. Top of the table and time wasting after half an hour?! Shocking. Some of the antics were disgraceful. Especially from Sam Johnstone! #bfc #wba #YouReds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bdiaby5 @BarnsleyFC Outstanding today big man!! 👏🏻👏🏻 #YouReds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc All the best mate. Hope you've had a good day. Love to Mrs. Mac and the kids!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryLineker But how can the ref not see it / give it?!! #poor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YWHelp I finish work at 5 Nikki. If I get home and can't make a brew it'll ruin my Saturday night!! Pressure is on. Or not!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YWHelp Morning Nikki. Apparently this is affecting home whilst I'm at work!! Any idea how long?! They've no water!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martynpool Mine is cling film. Worst substance on earth!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthemmo @TomCruise Yep!! YEP!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did you know this @w4keysenior<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can we all just take a minute to appreciate this trailer!! Absolutely superb!! I could listen to that dong all day long! #TopGun<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought @ConorChaplin10 was superb again today and his three goals were quality but for me @jacob_browny8 had his best game in a @BarnsleyFC shirt for a long time! Put himself about and was involved in everything! Including some quality shithousery!! 👏🏻👏🏻 #YouReds #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarnsleyFC @SkyBetEFLReward Me &amp; my son!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If a manager gets sacked because of results the players shouldn't get paid for a month! How many times do manager less teams play out of their skins the next game?! Play for the shirt every week! #EVECHE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarnsleyFC Torn between Mowatt and Chaplin against Hull. Both great strikes!! #YouReds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BFCStretch I think it depends on the day mate! Then can change from day to day!! 🤷🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TotalBarnsley It landed in the Iceland car-park apparently!! My lad was hoping we'd find it on the way home through the Dearne after the match!! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently @ConorChaplin10 was 6' 2" when he turned pro but he's run that much during his career that he's now 5' 6"!! What a shift again today capped off with a great WINNING goal!! #chappers #YouReds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BFCStretch @BarnsleyFC Great pic Stretch! Confirms what we all saw from the other end of the East Stand!! #YouReds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PepePoo2000 @Barnsleyis I've voted Mowatt but Halme was immense today. Loves to put his foot in but has a great touch too! #YouReds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>GETTTTTTT INNNNNNNNN!! #YouReds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on then today @BarnsleyFC #YouReds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cross31Paul Haha! Yeh Zoe sorted this today. I nearly hurled! I'm not good with sick. Although I have just scrubbed the back seat!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who ever said, have kids it'll be fun has clearly never had to stop a car journey after their child has projectile vommitted in his car seat and then had to clean the child, the car seat and the back seat of the car!! #reytlaugh #rocknroll<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ConorChaplin10 Keep fighting Conor. It'll come!! 🤞🏻The effort is  there and that's all that matters!! #YouReds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DAMO_RUSSKY Have it!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby @beccastarkeyx Yep. Dominated for 60 minutes again then one of them switches off! His effort to chase back impressed me though! Not. #YouReds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedsReport_ His work rate is a disgrace. Week in and week out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TransferSite There's a couple of belters at Barnsley he can have!! #YouReds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeonWobYP Better!! 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeonWobYP You're not helping Leon!! Positive thoughts only! #YouReds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeniusMUFC He's still have the same squad to pick from.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Might need an abacus on Wednesday for the @Boro v @BarnsleyFC game!! I'm going 8-7 to Barnsley!! #YouReds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fingers crossed that Gerhard Struber knows a couple of big, strong no nonsense Austrian lads who fancy the second half of the season in Yorkshire with @BarnsleyFC 🙄 #bfc #YouReds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeonWobYP Again!! 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@statedartneil Superb again Neil!! 👏🏻👏🏻👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This can't be right surely!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarnsleyFC @centrepointuk Picked a great night. Get people off the streets for a night!! 👏🏻👏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When did @RonJichardson release this album?!! And what's happened to the cardigans?!  https://t.co/zi2ds5CPT2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eaststandtyke At last a glass half full comment!! Well a third full!! I though @luke_luke19 looked lively again too. Thought he might have started. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits I'll take that with 3 to play!!  https://t.co/8eZo68aw4G<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely woeful. #bfc #YouReds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well @BarnsleyFC we've reached new levels of shite today!! Making this lot look decent. #bfc #YouReds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby What's new! They're all poor. Consistent though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice touch from @radioaire saying thanks for listening on #Alexa when you turn it off! It's the only one of the stations I've listened to that does it!! #littlethings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@susie_dent I think I'm a professional hurkle-durkler!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YorkshireTea Hang on!! Why are we dunking things 3 times?! Utter madness. A good dunk and in the cake hole! Job done! Bestest biscuit ever!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@stoobyleelaa  https://t.co/K7JHOZhbxn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stoobyleelaa @SheffieldStar @SCC_Help @syptweet What a tit!! In a Mini of all things!! 🤦🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I listened to episode 37 of #ShaggedMarriedAnnoyed on my journey to and from work last night and the fact that @IAmChrisRamsey chooses 3 biscuits mortified me more than the bathroom story! I suppose when you find the Sky remote you have the volume on an odd number too! #weirdo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby It all went downhill after Friday night's heroics mate!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And if that's a free kick we might as well all stop bothering now!! #WATCHE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's wearing tights. Enough said. #WATCHE #VAR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is going on with the @livescore app this season?! Had issues every week and this week the scores keep resetting to 0-0!! 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarnsleyFC He was quality again last night. Great to see a centre half that loves a scrap!! #YouReds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dougokane88 Keep that to yourself Doug till after January!! I thought Halme was quality again tonight but they need to stop conceding soft goals! Shocking defending for both again! Great point in the end though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby Aw mate. He winds me &amp; Matthew up so much! When he wants he can be quality but more often than not he's just bone idle and so frustrating!! You can see why Leeds off loaded some of these too!! There's only Halme any good. Another battling point though!! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Foul or no foul that was absolutely piss poor defending from the free kick. Again!! #bfc #barnsley<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OriginalGMac I've been known to sleep with two builders in the next room ripping a bathroom out and fitting a new one! Sort yourself out!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cross31Paul No mate they don't have VAR in the Championship!! Do they have it in the lower leagues?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BFCStretch I thought you'd be doing well mate! We are a bit old to be chasing whippets about nowadays!! 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BFCStretch Are you still playing Keith?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Flicking through Twitter for footy score updates is a nightmare now with #VAR Have they scored? Has it been ruled out?!!  https://t.co/rH5Ne7FI6d<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does the fire station in Pontypandy need a turning table?! Surely Fireman Sam can reverse the fire engine into the garage?!! Just seems like a luxury they don't need! 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby Don't you start I've enough with this lump!! Sods law we are working together this weekend! 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bluelightcard @shopDisney Olaf.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarnsleyFC @alex_mowatt I'd not noticed @ConorChaplin10 celebration! I was too busy watching @bdiaby5 firing the Ponte End up. Absolute quality and both were superb yesterday! #ureds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>VAR is a problem and I don't like it but it's not half as big a problem as the cheating whiny fkers playing the game nowadays! How would that tap on the shin cause a grown man to fall like he did?! Maybe the two refs came to the same decision - man up and play on!! #var #MANLIV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Furious_Fergie Have you been on the sauce gaffer?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dougokane88 Well this tweet aged well!! Much stronger &amp; tougher. 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought @ConorChaplin10 was motm today. He never stopped working all game and created a couple of good chances especially for the goal! I'm sure @alex_mowatt will give @CamMcGeehan some finishing tips this week!! 😲😉 #bfc #ureds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Much better performance from @BarnsleyFC today! Deserved more than the point we got but I would have taken it before kick off!! Great to see Kenny Dougall back in the team too!! #bfc #ureds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on today @BarnsleyFC Positive thoughts only!! #bfc #ureds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First drop into the new map! #fortnite #PS4share  https://t.co/a0TgDNB9aD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Furious_Fergie @ManUtd They'll be regular flights to the moon by then though!! 🤞🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just finished listening to this week's #ShaggedMarriedAnnoyed podcast! Is there any wonder @Rosemarino said yes after 6 months to @IAmChrisRamsey proposal?!! Rescued from a life of naps on bathroom floors and washing her own clothes in the shower while still wearing them!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has this been sorted @FortniteGame @FortniteStatus They're still not showing in my lads locker! 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not a big watcherer of rugby but this #Japan team can play a bit! I'm a bit dubious about some of the team though! They don't seem to be local lads. #JPNvSCO #RWC2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shameless plug for this little cutie! I know we're biased but he's done so well getting to the final 10! Why not send him a vote or two!! #barnsleyisbrill #barnsley #chronicle #bonnybaby @ Barnsley  https://t.co/Kt0ycFv53e<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely gutted that #Stendel has left! Disgraceful from @BarnsleyFC to force him out and then the pathetic club statement this morning. He deserved so much more! Why do football clubs / club owners continue to make the same shocking decisions?! #clueless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CraigIsRed I don't think you'll be short of material the next few weeks!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is ageing well!! Booking &amp; a goal for @CamMcGeehan in the first half! He's back!! #YouReds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dougokane88 Are any of the summer departees starting week in &amp; week out?!! No. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great to see @CamMcGeehan back in the @BarnsleyFC team for the game today! Come on boys!! #ureds #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeamLouieGeorge Well done Louie! 👏🏻👏🏻 What a little star you are! You keep going mate! 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ConorChaplin10 Well said Conor. 👏🏻👏🏻 #RedsTogether<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well after another great start and then two of the worst defensive blunders I've ever seen that resulted in conceding two goals! It was a battling performance that deserved the draw and the point! @BarnsleyFC #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fingers crossed for some good news from the club. 🙏🏻 Thoughts are with all those involved. @BarnsleyFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woeful. #MANARS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachelparris Not going to lie Rachel, I had to Google anachronistic!! I like it though! I'm going to go with the crustacean or cretaceous period! I think it suits him!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The ONLY good thing about being back at work in the morning is that I get to listen to @IAmChrisRamsey &amp; @Rosemarino podcast #ShaggedMarriedAnnoyed I save it for the car journeys to work!! 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martynpool @CostaCoffee Cam I get a brew?! Tea please! 🤞🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OfficialFPL @premierleague @ManUtd Aubameyang (c) hat-trick and James to get four all assisted by Wan Bissaka!! #easy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMattLucas Is that because he's an absolute tool who's so far detached from reality we should have found him living on Mars by now?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stoobyleelaa Somebody will have made a bob or two though mate!! #DohaWorldChampionships<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CraigBRadio @chrislowe1989 Give up. He was shocking today. Not on his own I agree but you could argue that he was to blame for all three goals. And what does he give with the ball at his feet?! Apart from the opposition chance to break!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislowe1989 Cavare is the most lathargic player I've ever seen. Gives the ball away consistently and doesn't put himself about. Watch their equaliser back. His header from our cleared corner is disgraceful!! Not for me. #bfc #barnsleyfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well I wasn't at the @BarnsleyFC Luton game but that today was as bad as I've seen at Oakwell! Chalk &amp; cheese compared to the effort &amp; performance against Leeds! Too many going through the motions I'm afraid. And after that start too. #poor #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarnsleyFC Was it??!! #ureds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on today #ureds @BarnsleyFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pickford is absolutely pants. How is he England's number 1?!! #EVEMCI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OfficialFPL Assist??! Bullshit. How on earth is that an assist?! 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarnsleyFC Think I might wear a retro rain jacket!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anybody know @andymortby address or has anybody got sight of him?!! Welfare check required!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior @simonlovidge He's not at work!! 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bdiaby5 @BarnsleyFC Go on Bambo!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior I was here a month later!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't fault the effort &amp; performance from @BarnsleyFC today!! Created plenty of chances &amp; played some lovely football! Results will come! #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tobysibbick Thought you were quality today Toby &amp; fully deserved the motm! 👏🏻👏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on today!! #UREDS #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OfficialFPL Kane because I've not got any of the others!! #FPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarnsleyCouncil What is going on with the roadworks &amp; temporary lights at the junction of Rotherham Road &amp; Burton Road?!! They're an absolute joke &amp; causing chaos!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it Friday yet?! I finally completely caught up with the @IAmChrisRamsey &amp; @Rosemarino (right way round 🤔) Podcast two days ago! Not had a thing to listen to since! #shaggedmarriedannoyed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TPLINKHelp Will the AV600 work if plugged into a surge protected extension lead?! Trying to avoid the extra cost of a pass through!! Thanks in advance!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well we've seen two films these rest days and there's a definite theme!! @OnceInHollywood @HobbsAndShaw #flamethrower 👌🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby @htafc Who??!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bipolar_Bear What's all this?! Where have you been?!! While you've been away the C bomb has been outlawed by the way!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steph_Rothstein @stoobyleelaa Like watching me &amp; you in the good old days Steve!! #not 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Loving the new @JamesBlunt single. Can't wait for the album! I don't care how 'uncool' he is /his music is! He was awesome live last year. We might even go again on his new tour!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior @SkyFootball No.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattdogbfc Adam Hammill?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby @SkySportsNews Only brought in because TV replays made the refs job even more impossible! VAR will bite every team on the arse at some point during the season just like referee mistakes did! Complete waste of time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@100Climbs One on Ch5 now that's better!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@josephbeardsall Can't keep going behind mate in this league! Going to be tough enough without chasing the game! It'll come good though! #bfc #ureds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When is the first of the 6 pointers @simonlovidge @andymortby Going to be a long old season at this rate!! #bfc #htafc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd take a point!! #bfc #ureds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CraigIsRed It's now ten passed four Craig &amp; I'm going 4-3!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emzie24781 Probably missed something going to the bar!! 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SoccerAM Barnsley FC.  https://t.co/VncoPyryB2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PepePoo2000 Call me old fashioned but 4-4-2 for me everytime! Back 4 is much better with Cavare out of it &amp; for me picks itself now. And good options in front of that! Still early days!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BritishConti @100Climbs @ProCyclingStats How much do I need to start a team?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stoobyleelaa There'll be free clinics for that mate!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc Are you planning some time off??!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taylorphinney What's been your best day on a bike competing?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martynpool @tuney4 Not seen it! Any good? I think he'll start tonight!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If this was Ronaldo or Messi they'd be on about it for years! Skill, technique &amp; a superb strike by @CauleyWoodrow #ureds #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CraigIsRed I don't think he's convinced with Cavare! Prone to switching off &amp; too lethargic at times!! 🤔 #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby @johnsmithstadia It's probably just that ongoing bitterness you've got mate! It'll clear up soon!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FortniteGame I got one earlier that didn't show! Will it show now?! 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby @simonlovidge Not much better at Oakwell mate!! 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can somebody do a welfare check on @andymortby 😬 Have you heard from him @simonlovidge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right then here we go! Maguire to limp off inside first 5 minutes, Wan Bissaka sent off on the hour &amp; Tammy Abraham to get more goals than he has Premier League appearances!! #mufc #mnuche<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc @tuney4 @simonlovidge No chance!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simonlovidge @tuney4 Just the 12 players in at Oakwell this summer! Added some more young quality to the side! What was the wager again for highest placed team at the end of the season?! #coyr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby @htafc Has he gone?!! @simonlovidge 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyBetHelp I’ve emailed you twice this week regarding a blocked account! Still awaiting a reply! Still can’t access #Super6 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Furious_Fergie @SkySportsNews I’m absolutely balled off with hearing about it! Roll on Friday night when it’s over &amp; the Scousers have lost! Remind me next summer to unfollow 90% of my timeline or just turn Twitter off!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthemmo 🖕🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCSport 14,000 @BarnsleyFC would have!! #coyr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great performance today by @BarnsleyFC All the new signings looked like they’d played in the team for years and the new look back four were solid!! Still can’t go wrong with @CamMcGeehan &amp; @alex_mowatt bossing the midfield!! 👏🏻👏🏻 #coyr #ureds #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MallikWilks @BarnsleyFC Great game today Malik topped off with that walk off! Shithousery at its finest!! 👏🏻👏🏻 #wellplayed<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@andymortby @BarnsleyFC @SheffieldUnited Yes mate! Can just about see our seats in the East Stand on the left!! 😉<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PepePoo2000 @Barnsleyis That’s a tough choice! Both so important for different reasons. I asked my son without giving him the options &amp; he said Kieffer straight away!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarnsleyFC @SkyBetChamp Even more pleased that I invested in season tickets for me &amp; my boy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits Had him all last season! Not a fan of ‘wasting’ money on a top keeper! Two first choice cheapies is all I need!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Cross31Paul @DRFC_ITEN @grantmccann11 I know mate. I don’t get why they still bother with contracts!! I suppose they suit though if they get the sack &amp; a payout! #poor<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cineworld Excellent! Really enjoyed it. Great concept for a film and the cast were superb!! 👍🏻<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Furious_Fergie It’s not so much that it’s the fact that others like Jones &amp; Young got new long term deals!! And he was nowhere near the worst midfielder at the club! Others should be going first!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby Come on anybody apart from Leeds!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We watched the Ted Bundy movie tonight! Fair to say that he wasn’t right!! Really enjoyed. Great to see @ZacEfron doing a serious role! Very believable psychopath!! 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cineworld Thanks. As long as you are aware! 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This Mansfield keeper is a big unit!! He’s like a super sized Peter Schmeichel! #NEWMAN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby Sorry mate. Not even the best German coach in England!! Stendel all day long!! 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cineworld Is there an issue with the app / booked tickets?! I’ve not been able to add them to my passbook for a while now!! 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I might as well just cancel my @SkySports subscription the amount I’m having to avoid watching it these days!! #ffs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarnsleyFC Absolute quality this season @EasyEatss #class<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OfficialFPL It’s not like I triple captained him or anything!! 🤦🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because my life is so rock n roll @frostatwork I’ve just caught up with this weeks GW!! Great to see how the garden has grown! Where’s that little spade from?! #wantone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think the @FA should turn two @ChampionsLeague spots down. Apart from the top two, the teams are shite the season!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrjakehumphrey What about the team who finished in 22nd place Jake?! Unbeaten at home this season!! #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeniusMUFC In his defence mate I don’t think he’s been right since the Liverpool game. But your right. I’m not convinced he’s at the level yet to lead the line of a top side. Not on his own anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JordanWard_ 👆🏻 Winner!! #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits Just asking for a friend!! He messed up &amp; didn’t realise you can’t Wildcard &amp; use Triple Captain!! When &amp; who would you suggest it goes to. Aguero at home this week or risk it the last gameweek?!! 🤷🏼‍♂️ #FPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The kettles on @MarkCavendish if you want to call for a brew before today’s stage start!! It’s a bit grim in town at the minute mate!! #yorkshireweather #TdY2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@millarmind @Waterstones Or fill yourself full of inspiration to write another one!! Loved Racing Through The Dark &amp; The Racer!! 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UtdBeforeFergie Why not!! #70sUtd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Furious_Fergie Is that what you call top bins??!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that’s it then! I’m all in with the little fella next season at @BarnsleyFC Two season tickets purchased today after school! I’m now the proud owner of one very happy 8 year old!! @SkyBetChamp here we come!! #bfc #oakwell #ureds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on refs blow the final whistles!! #bfc #ureds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One for William @simonlovidge 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You’ve got to love the @BarnsleyFC gaffer #DanielStendel not only for the unbeaten season at home and everything this team have achieved but also because he wins every header &amp; every 50-50!! He must be knackered after a game!! 👏🏻👏🏻 #bfc #ureds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CamMcGeehan @BarnsleyFC Superb again today Cam! You &amp; @alex_mowatt are solid in the middle of that midfield &amp; the work rate was exceptional!! 👍🏻 #ureds @BarnsleyFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frostatwork Looking forward to it Adam. Always enjoy your segments especially from the new garden!! 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior Haha! Love how they all flock to the ball!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior I’m not upset with it. I just don’t get it!! Maybe it’s a ploy to keep him at United &amp; continue being shit! And a massive disruption to the squad!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How has #Pogba got into the PFA team of the year?!! A good month does not make a good season! #mufc No #Hazard #Son or even #Neves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc Just seen a couple! Not good!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby Give it another season &amp; he’ll do you a job in League 1!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeniusMUFC 3-2 then??!! 😱 #ffs #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stoobyleelaa Should have come with some sort of warning!! 🤮<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UtdBeforeFergie Ten years old. Watched the match at home with my Nannan &amp; Grandad while @w4keysenior was at Wembley!! Mum was in the kitchen somewhere!! #memories<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The seasons not even over yet and I’m already bored off with all the United transfer talk! It’s going to be a long summer!! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidanWalshMUFC Is that on top of any money I make off-loading deadwood?! Like Pogba, Lukaku &amp; Sanchez?!! 🤔 #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve just seen the starting 11 for United tonight! Struggling to see a clean sheet being kept! Unless #davesaves is on one again!! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TigerWoods the most unrecognisable man in the world without his cap on!! #TheMasters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When a bloke has petrol poured on him &amp; is then set alight do people really need to be told not to try this at home?!! #bgt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stoobyleelaa They played like a side managed by him mate as well! One off for a deliberate elbow &amp; every challenge had a little bit extra on it!! Strange how he wasn’t hanging around for the team bus too!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Almost!! 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc Oh! Sneaky fkers!! #Division2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UnitedRedscom Easy target but Pogba. How many games has he bossed?! No offence to Wolves but he couldn’t stand out against their midfield &amp; he’s supposed to be world class!! #pisspoor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@susie351975 @BarnsleyFC Definitely not the two equalising goals!! 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarnsleyFC Heard the roar in Monk Bretton!! #getin #Ureds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dean14521741 What’s that saying about a box?!! #justasking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theJeremyVine @UKCycleChat Call me old fashioned but I find that driving with your eyes open and on your side of the road tends to work wonders!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just finished the book #SniperOne by Sgt Dan Mills. A great read &amp; awesome first hand account of the British Army’s biggest ever siege!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Donny_Rovers @Cross31Paul Yeh Peterborough are back on form I’m afraid! Can you ensure maximum effort against Sunderland please!! We need them to drop points somewhere! #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cross31Paul @Donny_Rovers Thought you might have done us a favour today mate!! 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awesome!! @jacob_browny8 straight over to the away end! 👏🏻👏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby And Fantasy team mate!! 😂 #FPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits I’ve done it! Free Hit Activated!! 😱 I didn’t want to use it but I’m all in! Not sure I’ll leave Wilson as captain though!!  https://t.co/pJd5dQxXcl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is what I was on about @w4keysenior #ouch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robreiner I love the passion in your tweets on this subject! I just can’t help but picture you as Max Belfort when I read them!! Keep up the good work! He’s an embarrassment but who are we to comment about embarrassing politicians!! #godhelpus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarrylKnee @BarnsleyFC @LiamLindsayy1 @SunderlandAFC Good shouts but not as good as these two for me although McCarthy &amp; Evans s before my time!! Solid &amp; classy! Major influences in the current unbeaten run!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarnsleyFC @LiamLindsayy1 @SunderlandAFC Because he’s absolute quality!! Has there ever been a better centre-half partnership at Oakwell?! I think you’ll struggle to name one better!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@utdreport The thoughts of Phil Jones coming back!! 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saw the @FightingWMyFam film earlier at the @cineworld baby screening in Leeds! Great film that has made me want to @WWE again!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just spent a very stressful hour upgrading my #PS4 hard drive!! I couldn’t get the USB with the system software to work initially but all good in the end!!  https://t.co/3l2rxqh3qs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dave32x Just said the same thing mate. Was shocked to see her on there!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@musgraveandrew Only athletes can get away with the word bonking. Now it appears only a cross country skier can get away with bonking &amp; sausage in the same tweet!! 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tetleyuk Somewhere over the French Alps on our way home from Spain earlier today onboard @jet2tweets #ItStartsWithTea  https://t.co/rTaOzFj5W7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits @FFPundits_Drew Is Brooks back?! 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeniusMUFC This year!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on Ole let’s have Mason Greenwood on to get the all important 3rd goal!! #PSGMUFC #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarajcox @StormHuntley Had to keep mine on for a vasectomy last week!! #surreal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OfficialFPL He’s done!! Gone this week. 2 points from Auba, Mkhitaryan &amp; Son!! #ffs #FPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits Morning. I’m done &amp; dusted early this week! Swapped Fraser for Mkhitaryan. Hoping for as good a result as midweek!!  https://t.co/WumHdg3TkJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DevilsOfUnited De Ligt. Young &amp; absolute quality. I’d keep old of Smalling though. Can’t believe Jones got a new contract!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's been around a while but a game!! #uncharted4  #PS4share  https://t.co/P2zYWynwf3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DalotDiogo @mctominay10 Do do do, come on and do the conga!! Do do do, it’s conga night for sure!! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just caught up with @BBCMOTD Fair play to @youngy18 holding his hands up after the howler for the Palace goal! If in doubt mate Row Z it!! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChemmySki @JamesOrrHeliski Well you be careful!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UnitedStandMUFC And are willing to part with actual money?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DevilsOfUnited If they’re good enough. They’re old enough!! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LukeRowe1990 Straight to the point Luke that’s what we like!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is there anybody there @SamsungUK @SamsungMobile<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits I’ve given up with a Captain!! After 2 weeks of Rashford &amp; Auba shenanigans!! Can’t see Aguero playing much either!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidanWalshMUFC Weaker.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is just pure filth!! Had to score to take it to the last penalty &amp; does this!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DevilsOfUnited Unexpected!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@musgraveandrew @sjurrothe @Clement_Parisse Awesome effort Andrew!! 👏🏻👏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So United started the game with a weakened side. Then were forced into 3 first half changes that only weakened the side more and yet we created more chances than this amazing Liverpool team!! 🤔 #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it me or have the Scousers targeted #Rashford today?!! #MUNLFC #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrStephenHowson Lukaku is absolute dog shit! Built like a barn &amp; getting knocked off the ball. First touch is appalling &amp; he can’t make a pass! Apart from that he’s quality. #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits Not enough now!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everything that is wrong with the modern game summed up in one @SkySports advert!! One of the biggest rivalries and biggest games of the season does not need an advert about the kick-off time! #boreoff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Send him off!! Mike Dean missed a chance there for his 100th red card!! Dry your eyes #Pochettini #BURTOT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lord_Sugar @Samsung @SamsungMobile Are they?! I’m fancying a change from Apple! The S10 looks cool!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously what is all this talking into your hand shite that goes on in football?! Even Sean Dyche is at it! #BURTOT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Fabianski clean sheet ruined in the second minute by Ryan Babel!! #ffs Of all the people!! #FPL #WHUFUL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hi there @SamsungUK I’m wanting to order my better half the Samsung Galaxy Watch in Rose Gold for her 40th next month! Not the new Active one. Do you still have the offer on with the free wireless charger?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>John Barnes talking even more sense!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SmythsToysUK My 8 year old son &amp; my 2 year old godson who is JCB mad!! He’s even got a new JCB bed! #obsessed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blackerlfc @CadburyUK 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lord_Sugar The going rate is a fiver apparently!! #toothfairy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UnitedStandMUFC Controversial reading this thread but I don’t get selling Smalling &amp; McTominay! Smalling isn’t a modern ball playing CB but he can do a job &amp; proved that on Monday. I’m not saying I’d start him but we are building a squad! And McT is young &amp; around people he can learn from!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarajcox Wine rack?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First night game for the little fella tonight! And it’s the re-arranged game from his first ever game that was called off! Great to see @bfc_official &amp; @burtonalbionfc supporting…  https://t.co/Rh5giYmqNW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just seen this in the park @tomhanks &amp; obviously thought of you!!  https://t.co/Yq2n91PTMh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on @markchapman let’s stop saying that @CauleyWoodrow is on loan from Fulham! He’s a red! Signed a permanent contract at @BarnsleyFC in January!! #bfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope. #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 @OfficialFPL Just to make things worse he’s in my team but thought the other two might do more. Obviously not taking into account how shit Chelsea are!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 @OfficialFPL Captain Auba. Vice captained Rashford!! #ffs #FPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OfficialFPL  https://t.co/XRzF9D0Uu4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timlovejoy A week next Tuesday!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cross31Paul Oh right. I assumed it was for somebody down injured in which case it was naughty not giving them the ball back but if that’s not the case - play on!! Unlucky!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cross31Paul I’ve seen the goal mate. Lovely finish! Why was the keeper throwing the ball out?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cross31Paul @joycie01 Was that before or after the throw in fiasco?!! A draw would have been better but The Reds have secured second spot!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cross31Paul @joycie01 I’m guessing he’s always had the same lips though!! Even when he was the best thing since sliced bread as Donny boss!! #winningmentality<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrMikePearce @RMRSavage @frostatwork Definitely! I think his garden will become the main garden on GW though eventually!! 🤫 #topsecret<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frostatwork Are we going to see the garden again this year on GW Adam?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@petatodd You can’t help your natural body shape Peta. Your lucky to be like you are. It’s not like you’ve said I need to lose weight. Healthy &amp; strong is what we all want surely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Disappointing that there’s nothing from the club this year @ManUtd @UtdBeforeFergie @MrStephenHowson @TotallyMUFC @BarnsleyFC #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I couldn’t let today pass with paying my respects to the @ManUtd &amp; @bfc_official legend #TommyTaylor #gonebutneverforgotten #flowersofmanchester #mufc #bfc @ Monk Bretton  https://t.co/dFM8WjnItj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidanWalshMUFC Torn between George Best &amp; Cantona! I only saw one play live but think I’d have to go with Georgie!! They couldn’t stop him back in the day when you could whack somebody. Imagine what he’d be like now!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Furious_Fergie I don’t see a Hammers side with much fight though unfortunately!! Liverpool will have to be poor for them to get anything! 🤞🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits The lottery that is Peps Rotation Policy!! He might come on!! Probably means that Aguero won’t start mid-week now too!! 🤦🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jacob_browny8 @BarnsleyFC Another great performance &amp; win!! What exactly did you get booked for?!! 🤷🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve not seen a centre half as silky smooth as @EasyEatss since @rioferdy5 retired!! Another quality display today at the heart of the @BarnsleyFC defence!! 👏🏻👏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just got home from the @BarnsleyFC game!! Another great win. Time to thaw out now!! 🥶<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that’s a first @SkySportsNews At the @BarnsleyFC v @SUFCOfficial game and after being blinded by the sun for the opening goal the Scunthorpe keeper has borrowed a cap from one of his own fans!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you there @BenDinnery What’s going on with Brooks! Just seen the latest on Sky Sports! What sort of knock keeps you out for 4 weeks??!! #FPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrjakehumphrey Has that come with the 💩🚰 too?! Had a lovely 24 hours earlier this week!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boogiebutler7 @SkySportsNews I was wrong! Fellaini has gone! Greatest transfer window ever!! 👏🏻👏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is @SkySportsNews wasting time &amp; effort with a full day of #DeadlineDay shite?! The worst transfer window ever!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What’s a Smart Watch Bollock @theJeremyVine 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UnitedStandMUFC I agree. Don’t get me wrong. He made the best of what he had and a bad situation but there’s no way he should have ever pulled on a United shirt. Never a United player. #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits Brooks off the best with his 12 points got me to 50 and saved me!! Bearing in mind I captained Auba!! 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieoliver What’s the best thing after this 24 hour bug??!! Fancying a toastie!! 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UnitedStandMUFC Derby!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If a linesman can’t spot that handball from 15 yards away then they might as well give up!! #shocker #BOLWBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DevilsOfUnited @GNev2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits Good job I always wait till the last minute then!! Still got the Kane issue to sort though!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits Who’s winding who up here?!! He was lame last week!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits How nearly?! Close enough to leave him on the bench?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awesome!! #BrexitShambles  https://t.co/6rhNRJqOAR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anybody actually know what on Earth is going on?! Or why we bothered in the first place?! Or more importantly in true @QuestionofSport style, what happens next?!! #BrexitChaos<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby Could try a little career break! See how it goes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby Have you applied yet mate?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never mind #Brexit and #NoDeal United might be about to sell #Fellaini For actual cash!! 😱 #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lord_Sugar It’s what he gets paid for!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UnitedStandMUFC Where does he need dropping off?! I knew this trailer would come in handy!! #mufc  https://t.co/1IbTqvX3a6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Oh how very lardidar!! I’ve freed the mountain bike from the shed!! Time to get my arse in gear!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EPLBible Sat Nav<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Drone Spotting Detection??!! There’s another future my careers advisor never mentioned!! #wtf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 🤦🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 @horrorflickchic Cheers mate. And to you for today!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 @horrorflickchic Is it today mate? It was mine yesterday!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby @SkySportsNews Plenty of time for the relegation stuff mate from March onwards!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby @SkySportsNews  https://t.co/fXrgTALx6f<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing tells an opposition player that he’s in for a rough, tough afternoon like a pair of tights!! #MUNREA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmyWilliamsMBE Aw that’s great news! Congratulations to you all!! 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can somebody explain to me why Kyle Walker is on the bench?! I’m no fan of his but he’s better than the one who’s just let a full-back ghost in behind him!! #MCILIV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To be fair that’s done finish from Stones!! He didn’t learn that at @BarnsleyFC #MCILIV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrStephenHowson Rashford will get all the plaudits but Herrera &amp; Lindelof were solid!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tom_williiams Stick or twist??!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s last chance saloon today for #Aubameyang in my #FPL team!! #ARSFUL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gailemms @bletchleypark Is it worth a visit Gail? Any good for an 8 year old?! #sneakybeaky<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby I know. And we’ve only played the shite sides since he decided to turn up!! 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits Locked and ready to smash some points this week on the back of a lucky 80 last week!! #FPL  https://t.co/NY1t7dBZx1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on now. Let’s not all lose our shit. It was still only Cardiff!! Yes we played much better. And yes we scored 5. But this is how life should be! Still a long way to go!! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@revkatebottley Not sure I can emotionally handle a 4th!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do companies use @Hermesparcels They are absolutely rubbish! More issues with a delivery today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior @tuney4 So you keep saying! I didn’t want SAF to get old &amp; retire but shit happens!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior @tuney4 His fate was sealed mate on Sunday when SAF was sat shaking his head &amp; Sir Bobby looked thoroughly pissed off! It wasn’t so much the result as the team he picked &amp; way they played. Shocking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chris_kammy Not so much the result Kammy. More the awful performance &amp; strange team / tactics selection!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has he gone yet?! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Arrived at @barnshospital at 12pm with my better half &amp; our 5 month old breast feeding baby boy for her 12:30 appointment that we were told would take 15 minutes. Still waiting!! Absolutely disgraceful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiamPaulCanning Better performance. Great to see some energy. Costly mistakes! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Better! #mufc #MANARS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There goes the energy in tonight’s United performance! #Fellaini is on! 🌳 #mufc #MANARS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember the days of blood &amp; thunder United v Arsenal games?! Players setting about each other in the tunnel before the kick-off! Oh I miss though games! #mufc #MUNARS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Furious_Fergie Like watching Chris Smalling!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Queue the Twitter meltdown!! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it me or is Jose really tryin to get himself Christmas off??!! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc Haha!! I know it’s shit mate but....!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CauleyWoodrow @BarnsleyFC Lovely little finish that Cauley! Would have been nice to see you start but maybe Tuesday!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cross31Paul @BarnsleyFC @drfc_official Poor today mate. Gave the ball away far too much! Both teams tried to play but no real cutting edge! Thought you’d nicked it with the last kick of the game!! #bfc #drfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cross31Paul @BarnsleyFC @drfc_official Well let’s hope it’s the down one then mate!! 😉<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BarnsleyBrew @BarnsleyIs Who knew?! And I've just noticed that it's sold in Maggie's which is only a short walk away from us! I'll be trying some this week!! 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarnsleyBrew @BarnsleyIs Why am I only just hearing about this?! Where will this shop be?! Is it just the one flavour / brew?! #loveabrew<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UnitedStandMUFC United swap Fellaini for .......... ! Anybody! Some pace &amp; energy!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is that Noah on the new Fruit Shoot advert @achrisevans I’m convinced it’s him doing the voice over!! 🤔 👏🏻👏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UtdBeforeFergie I don’t get what he sees in a midfield with Fellaini &amp; Matic in it?! It’s not like they put themselves about &amp; break play up. Too static &amp; easily played around! Why spend 50mil on Fred?! I’d much sooner get dicked having a go than lying down &amp; taking it like yesterday!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Slow. Energy-less. Predictable!! City can pass the ball for fun against most teams. Imagine how happy they were when they saw a United midfield with #Fellaini🌳 and #Matic🌲 in it!! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope you’re being vigilant @simonlovidge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haha!! Quality stuff!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh @juanmata8 you little beauty!! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anybody in football moan more than #Zaha Everytime he gets the ball! Still just a poor mans Nani! #CHECRY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AskPlayStation More specifically if I create a PSN account for that guest user will they be able to use that on their own PS4 when he gets one?!! It’s my son!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc @AskPlayStation @PlayStationUK I think so too mate. Will have to use his mums email cos mine is obviously linked to an existing PSN account.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc @AskPlayStation @PlayStationUK Just his own profile at the minute mate. That’s why I’m asking. Wanting to set him up on PSN but only if he can take that with him onto his own machine at Christmas!! Otherwise I’ll wait till then!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AskPlayStation My son has an account on my PS4 that isn't connected to the network yet. If I get him set up on my machine would he be able to use those details on his own PS4 at the end of December maybe?!! 😉 @PlayStationUK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrStephenHowson What’s this about Rom not travelling?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frostatwork Oooh what’s going on now?! Are we going to see it on the tele box?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkCavendish Why does Ed look like Spud from Trainspotting?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UtdBeforeFergie Amazing soundtrack too!! 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TotallyMUFC Juve have got a 50 year old defender that our two will never be as good as!! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DevilsOfUnited Hang on!! This can’t be right! Jose doesn’t do kids. No place for youth in a JM team!! Take your lies elsewhere! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’ll be really good to see #Ronaldo back at OT tonight. It’d be even better to see him limp off after two minutes with a tight hammy!! Come on #United #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AR__Pogba Is it Fifa??!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought @juanmata8 was superb today. The difference in the last couple of games with him in the team is massive!! Such a clever footballer! Man of the match for me! 👏🏻👏🏻 #CHEMUN #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somebody nip back to the bus &amp; tell Lukaku &amp; Martial that we’ve kicked off!! #CHEMUN #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frostatwork Are they just strung straight through the middle?! Not sure what to do with mine! Still outside at the minute!! 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby @JoelMortby7 Matthew has discovered Fifa on the PS4 this week!! I don’t think I’ll be ‘taking it easy’ for long!! And I’ve only got Fifa15!! Need to upgrade!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KitStopV2 Do we get a rebate??!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m not sure they’ll be a better dressed brother combination to visit #WBTourLondon all week!!  https://t.co/XZersQVnR8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NusseyMartin @ManUtdsUpdate By bringing in who?! There’s no acting fast with a board who can’t see beyond making money. Clearly his style doesn’t suit United but the real issues are much higher than manager level. And until that alters nothing will. Back to square one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NusseyMartin @ManUtdsUpdate Yeh it’s really classy! Really upholding the United values!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ManUtdsUpdate If this is true it’s disgraceful. Regardless of what you think about JM, for this to come out in the press it’s disgusting. There are bigger issues at United than the current manager. #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go on @GNev2 It’s about time somebody spoke the truth &amp; tore into the actual bigger issue!! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeitasRightFoot Absolute 🛎🔚<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits_Drew @FFPundits Lots! I’m sticking with Aguero over Kane though! Liverpool are due a thumping!! 😱 Given Hazard the armband though! 🤞🏻 #FPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits What??!! I didn’t even know!! 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@parkerpointer @KillingEve That’s next on the list! I’ve heard good things about it! 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@parkerpointer Aww don’t say that!! 3 down 3 to go!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m in London that weekend!! #NFLGame1Oct14<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UnitedStandMUFC I’ll do it!! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martynpool Definitely! From the Red Wedding to this! He’s had it rough!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right then here we go! Episode 1 of #Bodyguard on catch up!! Let’s see what all the fuss is about!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UnitedStandMUFC Another good reason to get shut!! How have we got to the point where a United midfield at OT has Matic &amp; 🌳 in it?! Matic is more than enough. He needs energy alongside him &amp; Pogba. Sorted. Fellaini will never be a United player. Simply not good enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarnsleyFC That’s a great effort at any time but on a Tuesday night to come all that way!! @Only1Argyle 👏🏻👏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UnitedStandMUFC Was just about type the exact same thing!! #shocking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UnitedStandMUFC Bore off!! It’s always going to be with Matic &amp; 🌳 in the same midfield. No pace. No creation. #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrStephenHowson Just been looking online! Sounds like a great shout! Young, innovative &amp; not scared! If he was Scottish he’d be perfect!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrEJPowell @KlTSTOP Thanks Elliott that’d be great!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TotallyMUFC They don’t mate. Not for this manager. He’s lost them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TotallyMUFC He’s got to go as well!! In fact he’s got to go first!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCMOTD  https://t.co/9q2ZdlskdS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like JM is fancying an extended Christmas break! Or is it the players thinking he needs one?! #mufc #WHUMUN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrEJPowell @KlTSTOP Is that the Juve third kit?! Are you happy with it?! Thinking about getting my boy one! What is the front like?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrStephenHowson Surely not!! It’s another must win game &amp; as much as Pogba isn’t living up to expectations / hype he’s got to play!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarnsleyFC I’d like a copy for my 7 year old son! He finally discovered football in the summer with the World Cup and is now obsessed!! He’s playing for a local team &amp; training 3 days a week! Was desperate to go to a game so I took him on Saturday v Burton!! Not quite what he wanted to see!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When did #Lukaku go off?! #mufc #MUNDER<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have you seen this @w4keysenior She’s got some voice for 7!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes @TigerWoods 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 #TOURChampionship<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somebody have a word with this tart! #embarrassing #feyenoord<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martynpool I’m not in denial though!! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martynpool Or tell the truth about your age!! 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great news that Stephen is stable in hospital. Here’s hoping for a full recovery! 🤞🏻 #goodluck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenDinnery @piravinthan9ls @FFPundits What use is that Ben for the thousands of #FPL managers?!! They should be made to announce all news before cut off time!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any news on #Pedro @BenDinnery Thinking if swapping him &amp; #Cedric for #Fraser &amp; #Holebas!! 🤔 @FFPundits So that I can just bench #Mendy #FPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So what are we doing with #Mendy @FFPundits Bench or bin?!! #FPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got to love #TheresaMay Somebody?! Anybody?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is it that people with money always get given stuff for free like the new @GoPro #Hero7 I know it’s free advertising but they can afford them anyway! I’ll do loads on my IG with it for free!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@prodnose Hours of endless fun!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What has @BarnsleyCouncil done to Cundy Cross?! Absolute joke!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UtdBeforeFergie And Clayton Blackmore!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YesterdaysStars @UtdBeforeFergie Cantona, Keane, Ronaldo, RVN &amp; Schmeichel. In doing this I realised 5 isn’t enough!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh @insomniacgames what have you done!! Finally fired up #SpiderManPS4 &amp; it is awesome!! 👏🏻👏🏻👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior Really?! I thought he was older than that mate to be honest!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc @N4GPodcast @ZTGD Don’t do it!! Safe flight back you lot! 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Wales are on fire! Queue the Ryan Giggs to manage United shouts!! #WALIRL #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonJichardson What are you supposed to do with that?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UtdBeforeFergie Across all ages &amp; very entertaining!! Bailey - Edwards - Robson - Best - Hughes #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I scored some belting OG’s in my time but this is a thing of beauty!! #haveit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxdan43 @TotallyMUFC @AnasSyakir I keep hearing this. What does it matter? SAF signed Djemba-Djemba &amp; Kleberson. They were shit so he got shut / didn’t play them. Sometimes signings don’t work out &amp; if they don’t you can’t expect him to keep flogging a dead horse! Difference nowadays is that they cost millions!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Martin_Watkins7 @TotallyMUFC I’m not saying Herrera can’t play just not in a back three!! Jones was shocking I agree! Smalling can defend especially against a typical no. 9. His distribution let’s him down but it’s what do you wasn’t from a CB. Ball winner or ball player?! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TotallyMUFC I can only think it was JM making his point about the Brighton game. He clearly blames the defence &amp; they took the brunt! But not Shaw surprisingly in Jose’s eyes! You can’t play an out &amp; out midfielder in a three at the back at this level! Completely different role.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TotallyMUFC I agree but what was the thinking with Herrera? Completely at fault for the second. Five yards behind the other two who had stepped out playing offside! Surely we have better options to play in a three if he’s going to!! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OriginalGMac I agree mate. He’s very miserable. I’d hoped we’d get the cocky, arrogant manager that used to wind us up when he was at Chelsea the first time round!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There’s a reason #Mourinho said he wanted at least one CB in the summer. The ones he’s got can’t defend. He’s not helping himself however playing a midfielder who can be a liability at the best of times as a 3rd CB!! #basics #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have Tottenham just won the title at Old Trafford or just beaten a poor United side?! What’s those celebrations about?! Oh yeh we might be struggling but still the biggest team in the world!! #hatedadoredneverignored #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OfficialFPL Nobody! It’s doomed!! Gone completely tits up this week!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cross31Paul And you went for a pint of vodka &amp; coke. Typical Dad!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it too late for me to take a gap year?!! I watch all these programmes with workshy’s on about gap years. #todo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robbeckettcomic Announcement or tickets on sale?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UnitedStandMUFC So much natural ability, strength &amp; pace but questionable application! And a shitehouse for an agent!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who knew that #nationalburgerday🍔 was a thing?! Elliot enjoyed his! Well he will later I’m sure!! #babyboy💙 all dressed up to third wheel on date day!! @ Handmade Burger Co, Meadowhall  https://t.co/6gzMyfPEle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc @RE_Games @Capcom_UK I remember playing it the first time mate. Finished up with lights on in the house!! I don’t do scary!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc @RE_Games @Capcom_UK Shit myself the first time round! I won’t be going back with her!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martynpool I bobbed it on but it was doing my head in!! Far too many lines!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How much did #Chelsea pay for this goalie??!! #robbed #CHEARS #shocker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy Birthday to this old lad today! @w4keysenior is 69 today bless him!! #birthdayboy #oldlad 🎈🎉🎁  https://t.co/jY9I0qSrI6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc Who? What?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not a bad 11 @w4keysenior #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And they say #United are bad!! 😱 #ARSMCI #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrStephenHowson @InStatFootball Can’t argue with that! Midfield 3 were quality! Fred looks like he’ll settle in well &amp; be a fan favourite!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrStephenHowson Fred.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get in @LukeShaw23 #superb 👏🏻👏🏻 #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think we can safely say that when #Valencia or #Dalot are fit, #Darmian can wave goodbye to any game time!! Absolute dogshit! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is no VAR. So stop fekin talking about it!! #MANLEI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UtdBeforeFergie Cool shorts though!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits Smalling!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@everything_utd That is most definitely a glass half full way of looking at this window mate!! 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robbeckettcomic Count me in! Just the 4 tickets mate please!! As long as it's up here. I'm not going darn sarth!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@everything_utd It’s like the great Laurent Blanc signing all over again!! #Godin ffs??! For my money invest in #Maguire long term! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>United paid 80 odd million for #Pogba &amp; were ridiculed! Two keepers in the league now for not much less! #bonkers And this means that #DeGea would be the first 100 million goalie!! #crazy #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cross31Paul @garysouter3 @dan_renham Looks better now mate! Easy this League 1!! 😳 #bfc #barnsley  https://t.co/HhF6osdGJS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SarahMillican75 @Hayles_Ellis @StandardIssueUK Loved it Sarah. Thanks! Very funny! Sweaty as fook though!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tuney4 Technically though it’s inside! Which makes it more acceptable than hoovering a ‘lawn’!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@parkerpointer 😬 Just seemed like the right thing to do!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it wrong that I’ve just hoovered &amp; mopped my new shed?! #rocknroll<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a ride that is @GeraintThomas86 👏🏻👏🏻 #letour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahMillican75 I’ll be there Sarah on Friday! Not sure how it’s worked out but I’ll be there with 3 ladies. One of whom is heavily pregnant so don’t be too funny!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>First trip to @cineworld for our 3 week old baby boy today! I’m not convinced him sleeping all the way through @mammamiamovie is the best review of the film! Not even Nanny @YLlewellyn singing could keep him awake!! 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@petatodd I read this last night. He has such a way with words that really put across the passion. There was a lot on display yesterday! #amazing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChptIII @MarkCavendish As always written from the heart by a man who who has seen it all and absolutely loves this sport about a man who has won it all and absolutely loves this sport! #chapeau to both. 👏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dealing with shit all day. Home &amp; changing nappies. I know which I prefer!! #babyboy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrStephenHowson I think it’s impossible to pick one. Schmeichel &amp; Van de Sar both had huge impacts! RVN was amazing up front. Blanc different class!! 😱 King Cantona for peanuts will always take some beating though. Born to be a red &amp; swan about at OT!! #legend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have you seen this @w4keysenior  https://t.co/JJKZeN1EkD<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Y0rkshirePudd Must be my upbringing!! I just think brown doesn’t go with bacon but is a must with sausage!! Or on a full breakfast!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does the manager of allegedly the best team in Europe need to play mind games the day before a derby?! #pep #mufc<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tuney4 @martynpool @OfficialFPL Bit early to call that mate! I’ve still got 3 to play!! Grimmers did well leaving Kane in though!! 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First time I’ve seen #VAR in action! Utter tosh! The only thing it will do is kill the game! VAR. Diving. Hiding mouth while talking! #gamekillers<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It’s a belter on Monday night football tonight!! 🙄 #MNF #donbra<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tuney4 @w4keysenior @FFPundits @martynpool All I’m saying is 104 points!! Prior planning &amp; preparation prevents piss poor performance!! Peps 7 P rule!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martynpool @tuney4 @w4keysenior @FFPundits You need to know when to keep quiet Pooley! I was bugging you up &amp; you’ve just ruined it!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tuney4 @w4keysenior @FFPundits I can't believe @martynpool only had one player in his team but managed to get more points than you Tuney! Cos he had the sense to captain him!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@petatodd Really pleased he’s not badly hurt Peta! Must be awful sat watching something like that.

<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior @frostatwork No thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frostatwork I blame my dad!! It’s all @w4keysenior fault!! #intheblood<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This @Wolves team play some lovely football!! Will be good to see them bring this to the premier league &amp; replace some deadwood!! 👍🏻 #LEEvWOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quality!!  https://t.co/chQ2uin46M<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’d love to hear how @SkyUK think they can justify more price rises to watch TV that is already extortionate!! At least Dick Turpin wore a mask!! #daylightrobbery<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If that’s a booking we might as well stop playing football now!! #BRIARS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Things could always be worse!! You could be an @Arsenal fan!! #BRIARS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why have they got blue lines?! #ARSMCI<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BarnsleyCouncil Are we getting a printout of the bin collection dates through the post this year??!! Or are they online somewhere so we can print them off?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stick ya #quadruple right up ya!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MyWakefield The ones outside the new estate at Newmillerdam. They could easily take them down on an evening &amp; weekends when nobody is working! They appear to have pallets of paving flags half stacked in the road. It’s just frustrating when you’re trying to get to or home from work!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MyWakefield Why are the roadworks just outside Newmillerdam left in place when workers aren’t there?! The lane closure is obviously there to protect workers constructing the footpath. Nothing to do with the road and they don’t work Sundays or through the night!! #lazy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really enjoyed the drive into @MyWakefield this morning! 3 sets of temporary lights in a 3 mile stretch of #BarnsleyRoad between the golf course &amp; Newmillerdam! #awesome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I must remember if I ever wake up in the middle of the night &amp; @Zoster79 isn’t in bed, first place I should look is the fridge!! #obviously @FiftyShades<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Main question from today! Would you rather have #ironman suit or @theblackpanther suit?!! @Marvel #decisions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last rest day and two film Saturday @cineworld for us today! Just watched @Marvel @theblackpanther and got @FiftyShades later!! His and hers!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Unbelievable. 36 years old. Absolutely tragic. #RIPLiamMiller<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has the referee changed his mind about the penalty yet?!! #LIVTOT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Struggling to see how anybody who knows anything about football would think that #Mangala would be a good signing!! #dogshit #ARSEVE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cineworld Weird!! Amazing to look at &amp; some great performances but felt like it didn’t quite know what it wanted to be!! I’ve know doubt it will smash the #oscars though! And I did enjoy it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 @Alexis_Sanchez I was being considerate of late towards certain ‘friends’! But being as though you asked! The world class striker we’ve stolen from you!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was Van Dyke playing tonight?! #75million #LIVWBA  https://t.co/ZKg3Non54G<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaroWozniacki @AustralianOpen Amazing! Hard work &amp; commitment pays off! Well done! 👏🏻👏🏻💪🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think the biggest thing with the @Alexis_Sanchez signing is that you feel he’s a player who can genuinely go &amp; win a game on his own! #somethingdifferent #missinglink #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m trying to wean myself off sugar in tea! It’s not an enjoyable process! #ruiningmybrew<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It’s a decent ball in but some awful defending!! #TOTSOU Well done to @HKane though! Any broken @alanshearer record is fine by me!! 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get some money on #Hazard to get at least 3 tomorrow! I’ve binned him out of my #FPL team so he’s bound to smash it!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well work is finally done until 2018!! Lucky enough to have a week off now and really looking forward to this Christmas! #familytime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who does Big Sam have the earpiece for?! #Everton #EVECHE<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 I’m going 7-6 to United tonight just so that you know!! #funfunfun Not a bus in sight!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a manager surely if a player came off without a hair out of place you’d be fuming?!! Trotted off like he’d been to the barbers!! Or salon on his case!! #CHENEW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior I can guarantee that Youngy will get sent off this week! He’s off my bench! 🤦🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior He’s vice-captain this week mate! Just in case Aguero doesn’t play!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is the #Asda already like a war zone?! #crazy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>As today progresses let's just think back to the abuse &amp; hysterics around #United paying 90mil for #Pogba #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have a word with yourselves City!! The Scousers have paid 35mil for #Oxlade-Chamberlain 😱 It'll take more than 55mil to get #Sanchez #crazy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OriginalGMac Quality footage! That last second when the camera man realises &amp; moves the camera!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eurosport_UK What did they used to eat in Sean's day assuming that gels are a fairly new invention!! #homeofcycling #giro100<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EamonnHolmes Not good Eamonn. Impossible task taking into account the feelings of loved ones watching, a major investigation and insatiable press. #poor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martynpool Raining??!! Still nice int t'arn mate!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got to love a bit of quality @rapha_uk packaging!! #chamoiscream #thebest @ Barnsley  https://t.co/uw6ekABwZ3<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Come on Sam!! #Giro100<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eurosport_UK Lengthen the 3k rule to 5k. Keep the GC boys away from the sprint end!! #homeofcycling #Giro100<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great to see @taylorphinney riding strong again this week! Amazing effort y'day &amp; dropping back to bring Talansky back today!! 💪🏻👏🏻👍🏻<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I've clearly missed something! #Portugal #Eurovision<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surely in a singing competition it's fairly important that you can sing?! #no #Eurovision<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martynpool Is that a tiger?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits I'm all in!! Triple captained Heyzeus!! #FPL<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FFPundits Oh!! To triple captain or not to triple captain??!! 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits Is this the last double game week?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First chance I've had to sit &amp; watch a prolonged spell of the #GirodItalia2017 on @Eurosport_UK Not a lot going on so far today! #boring<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carltonkirby You are most certainly a sticky sandwich filling distributed revision control system!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#mtb ride with @Zoster79 this afternoon! Stopped off at @RSPB_OldMoor for a brew! No signs of the old man @stephenlowe8 #glorious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eurosport_UK Do you think that on a pure sprinters stage the 3k rule should be extended to 5k to prevent incidents like y'day?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great result! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just got home in time for the end of #returnofthejedi on @SkyCinemaUK #MayThe4thBeWithYouDay<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is awesome! Makes me want to go back to see another game!!  https://t.co/GBZ9Tkgbox<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits I hope it's nil nil &amp; Countinho gets sent off!! #FPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@100Climbs @letouryorkshire Don't forget the Gods County setting!! #yorkshire<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Honestly it's inaccurate drivel like this that people watch &amp; think is real! #LineofDuty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior @FPLFantasyTalk Is there not a double game week coming up?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frostatwork Are ferns the best thing for a dry sheltered spot under a couple of mature trees Adam?! It gets a fair amount of sun!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not going to lie! This #NFLDraft2017 blows my mind! I'll stick to our transfer windows thanks!! 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior Not even a booking!! What sort of lame derby is this I'm missing?!! #MCIMUN #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenDinnery I had the same issue at the weekend! Jose ruined it by playing Mkhitaryan for the last 10!! 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theJeremyVine Is it just me or are we again being asked to vote when the parties involved still have no clue about what is going on?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Winner! #class Record breaker back in the day! Imagine how much he'd go for now!  https://t.co/flPzaV6gPU<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tuney4 @BBCMOTD Straight red for that??!! 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is anybody else absolutely fed up with elections or votes &amp; politicians?!! #justasking 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vredz_ @BenDinnery Definitely! Or we could just stick with the wonder kid &amp; keep our fingers crossed!! I've captained him this week so he'll blank for sure!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenDinnery What we need is a proven goal scorer. Maybe a record breaking goal scorer. If only we had one sat about somewhere!! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FPLAmyy @FFPundits Thinking about going with all 3 Amy!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Are we still 6th?! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc Just something about him mate. He's one of those that likes to give it out though too but then can't take it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it just me or is Shelvey one of those players you wouldn't get tired of kicking?!! #newlee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When are you back on GW @frostatwork Really enjoyed the new garden bits last year! Will there be a lengthy catch-up?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't get out swinging corners! Just a waste in my opinion!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaroWozniacki Wow! Absolutely stunning! 😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theterrywalton I missed the programme Terry! Why seaweed?! Is it essential?! My tub seems to be doing well! When can we pick some?! They went in last year!  https://t.co/Q7PWNEeH3U<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I have to say I used to think that @petosagan was an arrogant arsehole but the way he rides &amp; in that jersey, he's an absolute beast!! 🌈🚴👏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which one are you riding @ak47ms187 #trustarsene or #wengerout  https://t.co/6N8R38zGWn<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tuney4 No that's never good! They've got to stop it. Doesn't happen at rugby with raging hormones!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tuney4 He can't win mate. If he says anything he gets busted. If he doesn't he's miserable! Might as well gob off &amp; keep paying fines!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tuney4 And Cunte screaming for players to be booked is deserving of a gobful!! Typical Italian twat!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tuney4 Never a booking though mate. And fouls went after that weren't dealt with! Usual inconsistencies!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tuney4 Exactly! Would have been better off fetching him off! Going to ten men &amp; he was never going to shine!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Massive effort with ten men! No chance once that happened I'm afraid! Rojo &amp; Valencia were immense. Pogba missing in action! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We might see some bus parking now!! #CHEMUN #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby Anothef stupid challenge mate. Not a yellow but he's off again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TotallyMUFC I feared the worst before kick-off mate. Been impressed with the performance so far!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're going to book players for fouls then it's got to work both ways!! #Cahill not booked! #CHEMUN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm all for high tempo &amp; pressing but you can't keep making silly fouls this day &amp; age! #CHEMUN #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woke up in a cold sweat during the night! Having a nightmare about #Fellaini leading the front line for Utd in a cup game v Chelsea! #mufc 😱<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I bet #suttonutd can't wait!! #arswat #FACup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quite possibly watched my first and last sprint finish of the season on @Eurosport_UK today. Sad sad times. #keepdiscovery @SkyUK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There genuinely is no better feeling than finishing nights on a Monday morning &amp; driving home to bed while the rest of the world go to work!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's married to an ex-tennis star @GaryLineker 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did #Mourinho just give his notebook to that young fan in the crowd?! #mufc #MUFCvsWAFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Such a shame that #Smalling is awful with the ball at his feet! Pace &amp; power but is not comfortable at all with the ball! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So much disappointment in the voices of the @BBCSport commentators now! What did they expect first half?! It's #Wigan cup final! #MUFCvsWAFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tuney4 @Ibra_official Ha! Not sure what I thought I'd seen last night mate! Lovely little finish though!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet again @SkyUK showing that unless its @SkySports @SkyCinemaUK or @skyatlantic with its 1 decent prog they're not bothered! #keepdiscovery<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How can @SkyUK possibly contemplate losing @DiscoveryUK &amp; @Eurosport_UK  So many programmes that we all love &amp; watch! #keepdiscovery<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Always captain #Sanchez @w4keysenior #arsbur<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 He's asking for trouble!! #arsbur<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Well @PassengersMovie was awesome!! @CineSheff #passengers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stephenlowe8 I did say you'd probably be happy with just a bar of humbug to suck on!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc @w4keysenior Up and at 'em today! Been in town for a haircut and a few bits!! #tirednowthough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Enrique0821 Haha! I wondered how long it would take! I wouldn't pay him out in old washers!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks @Abbiedew Nights again tonight then 4 days off! Back in Christmas Day morning I'm afraid! #norest #notgood<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Morning @Abbiedew It's been quite cold on the night shift! Damp &amp; foggy journey home but climbing into a warm bed now!! #nights<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior Just about to get in bed! What you doing up?! #thinkhemeansme<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Waste of money! Oh no wait he was free!! Too old! Won't be able to do it in the premier league!! 😂 #mufc  https://t.co/0vhptPo11t<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently the red card for #JamieVardy is Rojo's fault!! 😱 #sameref #twofooted #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally got to see #StarWarsRogueOne tonight! #awesome @StarWarsUK #RogueOne Why do the droids always steal the show?! #droids #k2so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does this make you feel old @w4keysenior #georgie #thebest  https://t.co/3U9PpqpCJg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Ha! The main thing is mate that Pogba is a waste of money &amp; Zlatan was free!! #happier<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Have I mentioned my other half is a blue??!! #efc 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One for you @ak47ms187 #evillaugh  https://t.co/YZ7OtaxhlA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another quality 90 minutes from #Pogba How many games as our waste of money missed?! #bossedit #goal #assist #quality #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This ref is awful! Consistent though!! #CRYMUN #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Money well spent!! #benchwarmer  https://t.co/zPNc4iDM8Y<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Paid 55mil for a centre back to not play him and play a full-back in his position! #cityvwatford<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope Watford get a dozen! No #Iheanacho No recognised striker! #pah #FPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pundits that get paid to dramatise things can't say anything but managers can ruin a players confidence by dropping somebody?!! #klopp #lfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simonlovidge @andymortby Bad night for Barnsley mate! I don't think I'll see Hecky taking his kids to school in the morning!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby Oh ye of little faith!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits Haha! Got to be in it to win it! I'm all in!! I've had some bad luck last few weeks. Time to turn it around!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits But is it worth -4 to get them both in tonight?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrjakehumphrey Definitely Jake! 👏Results haven't been what anybody wanted but performances are better &amp; you can see what he's building!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits Help!! Do I bin off Firmino for Ericsson or swap Iheanacho for Origi which will give me cash to get Payet for Firmino after! #FPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The engine room! He makes us tick! #quality #class  https://t.co/OSAfrlt7Bw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@parkerpointer What??!! #wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear Jose! Please leave the big haired idiot on the bench where he is! Thanks, all #mufc fans!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mamilose What had he ever done right?! He wouldn't get passed me! He's never been a top class player!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Furious_Fergie Barnsley had the best years out of him gaffer! No doubt!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Paul Pogba is waste of money then what on earth are John Stones &amp; Raheem Sterling?!! #leimci #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's done! Starting on -8 this week! Bedtime for me after a night shift! Fingers crossed for goals while I sleep! #FPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I bet Aguero is causing #FPL managers more problems than he has for Pep!! #minuspoints #moneytoburn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd kill for a wildcard!! #FPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Origi or Iheanacho??!! #FPL Decisions decisions!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits Dropping Aguero &amp; Negredo. Was thinking Costa &amp; one of either Origi or Iheanacho??!! Think Liverpool have the 'better' fixtures!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Battlefield Why whenever I quit to get back to the main menu does it never work?! #ps4 #battlefield1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's an issue! #ocd  https://t.co/hULjslnjqW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My last comment on the most recent disappointment! #mufc  https://t.co/uEh7twV1uT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He could have brought Mata on &amp; we wouldn't have conceded! In fact I'm confident Romero wouldn't have given that penalty away! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's an absolute clown. Never been a United footballer &amp; never will be!! #fellaini #useless #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Furious_Fergie United to win easily with their best league performance of the season &amp; @Zoster79 to be in tears! Either that or a domestic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tell me again why Pep bought this keeper?! He's shite. #bravo #city<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Little bit excited!! #GuardiansOfTheGalaxy #vol2  https://t.co/9eBdCBuPrk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits I'd be shit at OT mate. I'd have to have two squads!! All that money!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits He's going &amp; I can feel -4 coming on! Thinking of going with Costa &amp; investing elsewhere too!! I'm borderline mini wildcard!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it just me or is Sergio not a big fan of Sideshow Bob?!  https://t.co/uZFh6dAzL1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits Sanchez. Costa. Hazard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I take it Adrian didn't play out of his skin this week?! #WHUvAFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Lucky?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Fraid big mate! Ozil &amp; Walcott!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits Do I have to?! Big gamble on Monday night. Counting on Hull's defence! At least I swapped the armband! #agueroshocker  https://t.co/ZImFbdfSAt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior For standing on??!! #swinger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior And better on the ball!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@virginmedia That would involve numerous households on the street giving permission! We each own our bit! You need to send letters out!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@virginmedia I've already done that. The issue is that we live on a private road! 😞<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@theJeremyVine Awful story. I cycle myself - wouldn't dream of not wearing my helmet. I don't understand the ones who do! There's loads tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not sure which is most bizarre?! The live 'murder' investigation on the @theJeremyVine show or the fact that I'm listening intently!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OriginalGMac Now that you're an expert you can fit mine when I get some!! #plugandplay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tuney4 @lynz864 @helpsainsburys It's a gender thing mate! #nesh<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@stephenlowe8 Curtain raiser?!! @Zoster79 what is the old fool on about?! I'm hoping he's not blagged some of my share?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We do like a stripy lawn!! #homestead #houseonthehill @ Barnsley  https://t.co/keOYchytXD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why have I just been mowing the lawns in a downpour that wasn't forecast @Abbiedew Too much brew work not enough weather work!! #barnsley<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Greed? Stupidity? I'll go with a bit of both!! #SamAllardyce<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What are the odds on #SamAllardyce being back at #WestHam before Christmas?!! 😳<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Back from the cinema in time to see the @Redskins on @SkySportsNFL #nice 🏈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc I've just got back from watching Bridget Jones mate!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rioferdy5 Energy From Herrera #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rioferdy5 Thank The Lord #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't care what people say! David #Luiz is money well spent!! #AFCvCFC #howmuch #ffs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Without #FPL I'd be wanting #Swansea to win 4 nil. Because of it I hope they win 4-3 &amp; #Aguero gets the 3!! #itsjustwrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Loving the energy &amp; tenacity that @AnderHerrera brings to the team! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What did #Carragher say?! #noidea<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right. What's this @AppleMusic thing about?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior Yes mate. He's in!! And captain! Although Swansea are due!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits Well after careful consideration &amp; much tinkering due to price rises this week!! It's done! #wildcard played!! #FPL  https://t.co/Pyk4mIqfkT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really enjoyed @theJeremyVine show on @BBCRadio2 today! Love how he names &amp; unofficially shames people with dubious views!! #severehaircut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RibbleCycles Received my new gloves this week. Really pleased with the service but concerned about the red tint to the white bits!!  https://t.co/16U6VmHI4b<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well he's finished! Such a sad little face!! Really cool build though! @lego_group #wall.e #lego…  https://t.co/YGGmcDzxi0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just a quick question @GNev2 Do managers even sign a contract at Valencia?!! 🎠<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's fair to say that I'm more than just a little bit excited for @mag7movie this weekend!! #Magnificent7<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>First tweet with my new phone! Got to say it's exactly the same experience as before! #iphone7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Apple What is the point in having people book appointments online to get a new phone &amp; then have a queue the full length of the shop?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cineworld Can't wait to see this! Tickets booked for Monday night! Taking the old folk to watch the new version too! #Mag7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits Sat tinkering for a while last night! Think it's looking ok now! #FPL  https://t.co/TVo4IbeANZ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Think we'll both be happy with these two on the big screen @Zoster79 #PassengersMovie  https://t.co/dZSNXUhfUK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UrmstonLordMUFC @w4keysenior It's not intended as a comparison. It's highlighting the fact that Rooney gets undeserved abuse!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's been poor so far this season but the stats don't lie! If he wasn't English &amp; playing for United he'd be a world beater! #MUFC  https://t.co/oPEBoggaHq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think @RibbleCycles are the best online bike shop after they gave me £10 off to give to my friends!  https://t.co/2qd7FUE9ND<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MufcDevilUpdate An arm for the armband!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TotallyMUFC @BSchweinsteiger It's time to drop Rooney and play Herrera! Get some energy into the midfield! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just to compound things today I've still got #capoue sat on my bench!! #FPL #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can you tell what it is yet?! #lego #awesome @lego_group @ Barnsley  https://t.co/nLITzb0yuZ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior And scored goal of the season to win it mate apparently!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits Captain pick this week is a nightmare! Choice of Zlatan, Lukaku, Costa, Ozil &amp; Mahrez!! All playing so called weaker teams!! #FPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katie_louise_1 I thought it was going to be something exciting!! You'll be fine!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katie_louise_1 Good luck! What you doing?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LEGO_Group Disappointed that we couldn't use our VIP cards at @LEGOLANDWindsor last week??!! Thought they'd all be the same company!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Just picked little lad up from school &amp; he's been telling me all about @roald_dahl He says his second favourite is @davidwalliams though!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@everything_utd What about Carrick?! Nobody better for controlling the tempo &amp; keeping the team ticking! I agree with Herrera though! 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#roalddahl100 #roalddahlday #bfg @ Barnsley  https://t.co/nbi4PggEEP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear Ronald Koeman. Please leave #Deulofeu where he is! #Capoue on the bench!! #FPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CastelliCafe Do you think that would be too much?! The combination! Not the price!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CastelliCafe Is the Isterico vest making a comeback this year?! I'm wanting a thermal vest over my #Gabba on early morning winter commutes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobbieSavage8 Definitely. Anywhere else on the pitch &amp; it's a straight red!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc @simonlovidge @andymortby @clint8301 @andy6067 @Fish95A Top result!! Home grown manager &amp; a shit load of quality on loan!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc @simonlovidge @andymortby @clint8301 @andy6067 @Fish95A Utd?? Great result. Top idea not turning up in the first 35 mins!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I could really do with #Deulofeu or #Drinkwater not playing this weekend! #Capoue on the bench &amp; having a screamer!! #FPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Didn't realise it was the big derby today @simonlovidge @andymortby v @McClellanLufc @clint8301<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just so that you know @ak47ms187 I've put #Ozil in my #FPL team! #sorry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New match day t-shirt wasn't off to the best start today! Only 3 points though!! #onlyagame 😡…  https://t.co/KrD7WuIQzx<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Good to here #JM being honest &amp; fair in his interview! And keeping the toys in the cot when he's obviously hurting! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@everything_utd I'll take this seasons worst performance over last seasons though! Outplayed for the majority but not destroyed! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear Claudio. Welcome to the Premier League! #Bravo #MUFCvsMCFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If that was an outfield player he'd be off! #DerbyDay #MUFCvsMCFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not at the races so far today I'm afraid. #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Specialized_UK I'm looking to replace the BB on my 2013 Secteur Triple. What size do I need? Can't find the specs anywhere!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BBCSport Can she name one?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How bad is #Vardy Doctor?! He's had that pot on all season?!! #ENG #Euro2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@100Climbs Theft. Deception. Liverpool must have committed something in that deal!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got to love @fizzer18 positivity!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's like playing with ten men! #Sterling #ENG #EURO2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shitty free-kick to concede but what is #Hart doing there?! 30 yards out!! #ENG #WAL #Euros2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@100Climbs And it still amazes me how many can't use both feet!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can somebody just explain how #Sterling is an international footballer?!! And how on earth he starts before #Vardy #ENG #EURO2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right. It's #Wales ffs! Heads on &amp; let's show them what's what! #ENG #EURO2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I bet this goalkeeper doesn't wear his short sleeved shirt for home games!! #PORISL #EURO2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imagine being arguably the best player in the world &amp; going from playing with Madrid to this shower!! #PORISL #EURO2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know he's scored but on the whole it's good to see that #Nani is still shite!! #PORISL #EURO2016<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc @PhilHayYEP @w4keysenior They love him at Barnsley mate! If he's any sense he'll come back on loan!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tuney4 will like this!! That lad loves an external hoover!! #wrong #just #wrong #fakegrass   https://t.co/0SeqETq2n4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc @PhilHayYEP @w4keysenior He looks very handy mate. Was on loan at Oakwell. Scored some good goals including one in the final!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know things aren't good when #Berba is one of the quickest &amp; fittest on the pitch!! #SoccerAid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fizzer18 @10Ronaldinho On the plus side Phil he's a Brazilian legend!! But please, keep them shut!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Absolute quality!! #defensiveangel  https://t.co/WKUUdcJots<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc We'll see mate! Been spoilt for too long maybe! Would love to see #Zlatan in a #United shirt! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits What odds on the reigning champions being relegated?! They could well lose the backbone of the side this summer!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc I still think he's got issues as a man mate. Lack of class! But he's usually been naughty when he's lost! He's a winner!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it next season yet?! #Mourinho #Zlatan #excited #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is just amazing!! #legend #TheGreatest   https://t.co/rbzXJ5kpgv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OriginalGMac What like a door?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure you can ask for more as a manager @w4keysenior #MUFC   https://t.co/qMq57jtubi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 What's your thoughts on #Vardy mate?! Not a natural Gooner in my opinion!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Furious_Fergie What about the Jarmuns gaffer?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But seriously how will we cope without #Delph He's the only one we had with real Sunday league class!! #EURO2016 #England<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a season!! Not once has he looked out of place or out of his depth! Well done @MarcusRashford #MUFC #EURO2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@everything_utd I like Mata but he's not mobile or dynamic enough. I'd keep Blind. He can play in a few spots &amp; is classy on the ball. #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've no doubt @stephenlowe8 will be all over #Springwatch but just in case he's not @Zoster79 said I should tell him  https://t.co/X9V7kdqUcZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And #Pepe is a disgrace! #UCLfinal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How much would you love to smash #Ramos I'd kick him till my foot bled! #UCLfinal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@100Climbs That would be a dirty fight!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits I think he'll be closer to £12m! What about Zlatan?!! #bankbuster<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's have it @ak47ms187 Bring that fire back!! #passion #rivalry #MUFC #afc  https://t.co/fnEjqxZbQm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've already seen four different 'Possible Line-ups Under Mourinho'!! Going to be a long, repetitive summer. #MUFC #JoseMourinho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it August yet?!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have my reservations but there's no doubting he's a winner and will bring some passion back to the dugout!! #JoseMourinho #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not gonna lie. Little bit uncomfortable watching @tomhanks have sex on the big screen! Like watching your parents!! @hologramforking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It just gets better!!   https://t.co/lfI78Xr8EP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@everything_utd That's the United effect! It'll be even worse this summer! Every time somebody scores in the Euro's!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surely owning somebody's name as an employer is #slavery Absolutely crazy! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OriginalGMac @StarWarsUK You are! And grumpy! #victor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwainWynEvans @BBCLookNorth It's no good when I'm in bed after a night shift Owain!! Rest days are Wednesday till Saturday!! #thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GianlucaRentona Only time will tell my friend!! As long as he gets shut of #Fellaini before August I'll be happy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GianlucaRentona No change of tune. Not my first choice but best of what's out there!! #ManchesterWillNeverBeBlue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@everything_utd I've no doubt they're hoping he's just going to walk away. Resign or step aside. They've no bottle with most things!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tuney4 @Zoster79 Have I missed a real lottery win somewhere?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits Neymar at United!! Haha! #FPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like this @Zoster79 Maybe not quite so dark!   https://t.co/zO42xNSJNM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits It won't matter in La Liga!! #FPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MufcDevilUpdate It would be nice to see players playing in their preferred positions!! With the exception of Rooney in midfield!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@everything_utd No it'll be hard for the new gaffer to ignore him &amp; a couple more now that we may never have seen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Support I appear to be constantly getting a notification red number when I've been in the app even though there's nothing there! #annoying<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tuney4 Cheers mate! Not the best spectacle but got the win!! #MUFC #FACupFinal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woohoo another 30 minutes of this dross!! #FACupFinal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Win a fekin header you muppet! #Fellaini #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior No doubt #Fellaini will claim he meant that!! I'd say shit first touch!! #MUFC #FACupFinal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bore off! Get #Fellaini off and #Lingard on. Let #Martial go where he wants &amp; get at 'em. #attackattackattack #MUFC #FACupFinal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tuney No chance with this cloud mate!! #notseenapenny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Fellaini is just awful. #mufc #FACupFinal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imagine playing Giggs on the right or Kanchelski's on the left!! Pace - byline. Job done!! This management game is easy!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's slow in the final 3rd cos the only thing wrong footed footballers on the wings can do is check backwards onto their strong foot. #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can somebody spend some time with #Smalling this summer &amp; get him using his left foot!! #MUFC #FACupFinal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior How can he not score with that. The only thing he's half decent at &amp; he didn't connect!! #petroltanker #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby @BBCSport I was just thinking I can't cope with this numpty for 90 minutes!! #poor<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Seriously what is going on?! #April #snow #showers #Yorkshire @ Barnsley  https://t.co/xgt3F7IHS7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abbymaep @letouryorkshire Well that's no good I'd bought ticketed for some road near Ponte to see you whizz by!! 👎🏻😞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QuestionofSport Atlanta. Athens. Amsterdam??! Err!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@petatodd That's rubbish!! From edge of Twitter seat to throwing phone on the fire!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@petatodd I'm going with the obvious!! 👶🏻 But could well be more 🏎 related!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Check out Global Bike to Work Day on Strava. Ready to tackle it? #strava #CommutesCount  https://t.co/lErLlotx35  https://t.co/lErLlotx35<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TotallyMUFC @ManUtd FA Cup! Been a while &amp; most of the squad need to experience winning something!! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something to keep you busy this summer @w4keysenior   https://t.co/NuzNsKqeE8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it too much to ask for a quick fire #Kane hat-trick?!! #FPL #captain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@L_ArmiTstead @CarolArmitstead Check out this jersey @Zoster79 Very cool!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@everything_utd Yes but watch the build up of that block back. He gave the ball away when it was easier not to. He's not a United player!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All this effort in the snow &amp; the winner only gets £15,584!! Something not right there! #homeofcycling #LiegeBastogneLiege<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@100Climbs Sounds good! We could be placed anywhere on the Saturday but I'm guessing it'll be the town end roundabout in Ponte!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never mind the riders. Spare a thought for the poor kit men / women &amp; mechanics!! #filthy #LiegeBastogneLiege #homeofcycling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@100Climbs Where are you heading for Simon?! I'm working it the Saturday!! Somewhere near Ponte!! 🚓<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@saddleblaze Kind of weather that makes you suddenly favour watching it on tele near the kettle!! #LiegeBastogneLiege<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Note to self! Stop moaning about a bit of wind &amp; rain on my 15 mile commute to work!! #LiegeBastogneLiege #homeofcycling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@antmccrossan @LiegeBastogneL Not a good day at the office!! #LiegeBastogneLiege<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amazing to see some in the peleton without gloves on! Footballers wear them in the summer!! #LiegeBastogneLiege #homeofcycling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits Lets hope Mahrez, Okazaki &amp; Morgan are!! #FPL #LeiSwa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TotallyMUFC 1999 - Schmeichel penalty save &amp; Giggsy winner! 2016 - De Gea penalty save &amp; Martial winner! #uncanny #quality #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CastelliCafe I wonder how many @CastelliCycling #Gabba jerseys are being worn and hidden in the peleton today at #LiegeBastogneLiege<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some serious back lawn envy going off!! #superb   https://t.co/aZxtXv8adj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carras16 I'd still put my mortgage on you in a foot race with #Fellaini<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@modcyclingphoto Snow shovel?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Furious_Fergie And every time he takes #FosuMensah off the defence goes tits up!! #mufc #FACup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Furious_Fergie I know he scored again but that boy #Fellaini will never be a footballer while he's got a hole in arse pointing downhill!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right that'll do! Take #Ageuro off now. I swapped captains this morning &amp; gave #Kane the armband!! #FPL #MCISTK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OriginalGMac @Zoster79 She knows how much she's been missed mate! 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't wait to see my girl today! I think @Zoster79 has just touched down at the airport! Feels like she's been gone for weeks! #missedher<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Win with Giant - Tour de Yorkshire TCR Advanced Competition  https://t.co/s0C6o6RjoT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Plus winning something makes it harder to let LVG go!! Unless it's a repeat of Fergie's cup win!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 I'm fairly confident of getting through Saturday mate although they'll be desperate for a performance! Not thinking about 🏆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm guessing the #Everton fans can't get out &amp; are being held back!! Feel for them. Woeful performance! #LIVvEFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior @TotallyMUFC Like watching me that old lad!! #scorerofgreatowngoals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>'It's a terrific header'!! Scuffed off his head onto his shoulder &amp; looped into the net! #LIVvEFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How much did Liverpool get for #Sterling #theft #nufcvcity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits Both!! 😱😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that's the viewing sorted for the next few days!! @starwars #starwars #starwarstheforceawakens  https://t.co/KVhFwGWHs0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Went to @CineSheff to watch 2 films today &amp; ended up watching 3 back to back!! #unlimitedcard @Criminal_Movie @TheHuntsman @eyeintheskyfilm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That feeling when your triple captain gets a hat-trick in the first of a double Gameweek!! #FPL   https://t.co/TM8h0Mr9d3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits Just brought Barkley on!! #pointless I've got Mahrez on the bench. Would have preferred him coming in now!! #FPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Villa must be shocking!! We've scored in the first half!! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somebody go through Mirallas. Let's see how 'unfit' #Lukaku is! #FPL #joke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WTAF?!! How can you run a fantasy team with some of these 'real' managers?! If they're fit enough to sub they're fit enough to play! #FPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Furious_Fergie What if we concede first?!! 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@citizenfishy Is that your new training buddy?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Furious_Fergie Not today gaffer! It's all good today. I've even put the boy Rashford in my fantasy team! First United player of the season!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@parkerpointer @SkyUK Commonly known as avoiding the question Lou!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a load of rubbish! Second rate viewing at ridiculous prices.   https://t.co/NvUYUtLH6n<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Silence is golden @SkyUK I'm guessing there is no justification for the latest price hike?! #greed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've decided I'd rather have a manager with no class but passion than some muppet sat on his arse doodling!! #mufc #LVGOUT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Me neither. If it is Mourinho though he keeps spouting that summer is the best time! Could do with Wenger to get us back to 4th!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Now you're just being mean!! #stuffofnightmares<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 This was the only game I wanted to win! For Leicester! Don't want LVG winning something &amp; staying!! 😱🔫<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Lets hope for normality next season!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Darmian is having a mare! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 What happened to midfielders that put a foot in and won a tackle?! #awful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not strong enough! #weak #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@everything_utd Yeh but what the fk was Schneiderlin doing! I've got a 5 year old who wouldn't have lost that tackle! #weak #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits @RomeluLukaku9 I also dropped Siggurdson to get an extra DGW player in! Cabaye!! #shyzer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits @RomeluLukaku9 Captain #Lukaku they said! Not #Aguero they said!! #FPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Furious_Fergie @ManUtd The Sharp one with the white armpit stripes!! #mufc I used to sleep in that one! #Robbo #hero<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theJeremyVine If it's not dodgy or avoiding paying the right tax why is it 'off shore'?! Why aren't we all doing it?!! #wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby @SkyUK It's a joke mate! I've never watched less footy! Gutted when we were told we couldn't get @virginmedia in the new house!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear @SkyUK I'd be grateful if you could take a minute to justify yet another price hike! Up £4.25 a month!! #joke #notfunny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quick question re. all the #Ronaldo rumours! Does his agent also represent #Mourinho #justasking #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carltonkirby @RealStephens Great to see two World Champs who are willing to ride on the front and attack whenever they can!! #amazing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@millarmind Has there ever been a World Champ who was willing to have a go in as many races?!! Always on the front! #chapeaux<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits Big Wes Morgan!! #FPL 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@100Climbs For Stannard?!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@carltonkirby Breakaway or bunch sprint? Your preference not tip for today! You always seem disappointed when they get caught #homeofcycling<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc @simonlovidge @clint8301 Unlike you lot we don't only sing when we're winning. Or in your case when United are losing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc @simonlovidge @clint8301 Can I comment now then?!! You stick to worrying about your first division team mate!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits And I could've afforded Coutinho!! #FPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's the last time I pay attention to @FFPundits Pleased I brought #Firmino in!! #FPL<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Well as I sit &amp; think that this is the last day of my 40th year, I really cannot believe how fast this last year has gone!! #flownby<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guydavies7 Never?! What's the issue?! Stick your X-ray on here mate! Twitter will tell you!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits Pleased I left Willian on the bench! Captained Ozil! De Bruyne. Mahrez &amp; Alli saved me!! #FPL<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Any reply from @SkySports or @SkyUK yet @andymortby about the extortionate prices to watch nothing over Xmas?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Not good mate. The man has no class! And the same fans who abused him for parking the bus now want him!! He won't excite either!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Oh yeh the bog eyed boy came good! Pleased for ya! #reallyam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Probably would have taken that in August mate but not how they're playing! Better performance apparently! #straws #clutching<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@everything_utd Lets also bear in mind that he inherited some poor players. A team will never play football with #Fellaini in it! #awful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits When do the Wildcards expire?! #FPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Not really mate but it makes teams like Stoke really good!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 First of all we've cornered the market on pathetic shocking &amp; annoying so knob off!! And I've been drinking since early Nov!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Lord_Sugar @YellowLimited @Pinarello_com Flying the flag in The Sunshine State!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanJamesPoulter Same to you Poults. Looks like you've had your fair share of fresh snow this week! #dumping<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior What about your own children?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TotallyMUFC @GrahamGham I don't get the out of CL thing. We were never going to win it this season so why not go &amp; win Europa?! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that'll do nicely!! #TheForceAwakens @CineSheff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've had to wait long enough!! It's time! @StarWarsUK #TheForceAwakens @CineSheff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Furious_Fergie All a challenge though gaffer! All left in a shitty state by previous managers!! 😉 #yourfault<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotSoClever45 Leave #LVG in place then. I really don't want Jose but can see it happening!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm happy to wait till the summer for #Pep rather than the man with no class #Mourinho Preferably with #Giggsy at the helm till then! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TotallyMUFC Not Mourinho. Arrogant with no class whatsoever! #Pep<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's disgraceful @GaryLineker If a manager gets sacked the players shouldn't get paid for a month!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@5liveSport @bbc5live When a manager gets the sack I think that players shouldn't get paid for a month!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior Awful!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on Wolves!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits Thinking about asking Jose to be my assistant! #FPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesRobsonMEN And the rest is history!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MazMckenzie How amazing is this tree @Zoster79<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior @skymovies That's not on old lad!! Yes I am!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I've just watched the last half hour of #YouveGotMail then flicked over to #LoneSurvivor on @skymovies while I have a brew! #extremes<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CastelliCafe Haha thanks! Tell me about it! It's going to be a foody Christmas!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CastelliCafe I'd love to share some #cafelove but 2 weeks with food poisoning has left me weak &amp; 1.5 stone lighter!! #noenergy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What channel is the #europaleague football on?! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@everything_utd Right back at left back with a left back on the bench &amp; an inexperienced right back playing?! I need a scratches head emoji!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TotallyMUFC Any goal would be a bonus!! I'm confident tonight though! Going 2 nil!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And people say that our Justice system is flawed!! #OscarPistorius<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iainmspillane @TheSufferfest Angels is a laugh a minute!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Decent half but I've given #Lukaku the curse of my #FPL captaincy!! He won't score tonight! #EVECRY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits I've got Lukaku as captain &amp; Cabaye so hoping for a 5-4 thriller to Everton with only those 2 scoring!! #FPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TransferSite Straight up cheating. Should be banned!! #simple<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 I know mate. If one team goes on a run over Christmas that'll be it. Job done! #champions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 What the hell is going on?! #crazy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least United don't concede!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@everything_utd No he really isn't. Janujaz is not good enough &amp; never will be!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits ARNAUTOVIC!! But I have Kolarov &amp; De Bruyne too! #FPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that appeal went well!! Not happy at house arrest - now looking at 15 years in prison!! Well played #Oscar #OscarPistorius #OscarAppeal<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Got to feel a bit for @youngy18 Outstanding last year &amp; has carried that into this season but can't get a start! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior Really?! Since when?! Robbing sods! You could do a couple of quid no problem!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remind me never to bring @w4keysenior to #Paddington train station! 30p for a pee!! It'd cost him a fortune!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RickyTomkins94 @Furious_Fergie Exactly! Giving what he got. Not giving then crying about it! And I'm not saying either were Saints!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Furious_Fergie @RickyTomkins94 Can't remember either crying when they got some though! They just gave it back. Harder!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Honestly it's just legalised murder ball!! #WorldCup2015<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 I've stopped banking on them mate!! Just a little 'vacation'! LA, San Diego &amp; Vegas!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 To be honest mate I think I'd have just punched him! At least Cantona made a red card worthwhile!! Spineless twat!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Funny without really being funny!! Thoughts on #Costa today?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Gomis has got 45 minutes left of his career in my #FPL team! 45 minutes to prove himself!! #halftime #hairdryer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is that our new left-back @McClellanLufc  ??!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc I think you need some extra sleep grumpy!! #harsh #again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Costa is an absolute disgrace. I'd kick him till my foot bled! #CHEvARS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Costa wants a two foot special round about knee high!! #twat #CHEvARS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cheers @SkyUK I didn't want to watch #CHEvARS anyway! Much prefer some #Championship rubbish! What am I paying so much for exactly?! #poor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkySportsGolf It's fair to say that The Force is Strong with this one! @melreidgolf #strong #superb<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If I were #Martial I'd still be taking a bow right in front of the #StretfordEnd Sometimes it's written in the stars!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Darmian, Blind, Smalling &amp; Carrick were quality today. Schweinsteiger was absolute class!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds like there's some big engines in the break today @TourofBritain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The_OlaJordan @Iwanrunner @bbcstrictly Is that to keep him quiet / in check??!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haha!! Sounds to me like somebody has realised #Madrid are a bunch of amateur bullies &amp; he's at THE biggest club in the world!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MarkCavendish No way! Especially if you're home with the little ones! Winds me right up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got a new gadget! Think I might lend it to @KeeleyDonovan #rubbish #weather  https://t.co/72K8PFXanG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshleyJarnoBall @ChronOnline I'm not surprised. Only seen him once against Everton! He looked very good. Good on the club!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gone from not having a #ScoobyDo to @Minecraft being so addictive!! Only downloaded my boy the demo but going to have to buy 'us' the game!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ManUtd That's that then!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And imagine how much those two would go for nowadays!! (see previous tweet!!) #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's just imagine that this raw talent we've bought does become the next #ThierryHenry or even better the next #KingCantona #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Hopefully he'll realise that if they were so desperate to get him they wouldn't have left it so late!! #muppets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 I think he'll be made to fight for his place but there's not much competition mate with what I've seen mate!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GNev2 You know yourself Gary that United can't win! We don't back youth apparently. Buy young prospect &amp; have now paid far too much!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What other small clubs forget is that when the biggest club in the world come knocking the price goes up by 20million. At least! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>'United are poor. United need a striker.' United buy a striker. 'United are trying to buy the league'. #knoboff #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Overrated this buying players mate!! Not selling them is fun though!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior I think he'll realise #Madrid are a bunch of halfwits &amp; that he's at the biggest club in the world! Then sign to stay!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surely #DeGea hasn't been left high &amp; dry by the biggest club in the world who wanted him so badly?! No paperwork from #Madrid Oh dear!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#RealMadrid biggest club in the world wanting to pay in instalments!! #giveup #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Monday morning. Nightshifts done. Raining. Bedtime! Rest days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After #Romero inspiring performances! #JackButland at #mufc anybody?!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cineworld Better than expected tbh! Very funny! That's the thing with #unlimited you get to see all sorts! #valueformoney<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just seen the @ManFromUNCLE film! Quite possibly my favourite film of the year so far! Excellent cast &amp; typically @realguyritchie #superb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits I've taken it off Rooney &amp; handed it to Benteke!! #FPL<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@acdedeoglu @BBCSport Absolute madness!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCSport Why do they need bulletproof cars in the first place?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OriginalGMac At Adidas HQ dumbass!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not overly bothered about the result tonight but at any time in the next 90 minutes if somebody were to snap #Stirling in two I'd be happy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mj88live @Doctor_Hutch Is it just me or is lifetime bans the only answer?! Convicted 'cheats' having a short break is not good enough!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UnitedStandMUFC @TotallyMUFC I'm quite surprised #LVG hasn't dropped #Carrick back to CB! Too many CM if the same ilk! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can anybody guess what is on tele?! @starwars #empire #strikes #back #stormtrooper  https://t.co/Qg8GNOs2Mv<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TotallyMUFC To be fair though they did get dicked last season against them!! #blessem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Apparently we STILL need a CB &amp; a keeper! #shocker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Looks like Arsenal's season started &amp; ended last weekend!! #openingweekend #banter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #sleepybaby #Stirling is worth 49million does somebody want to put a price on this lot?! #galacticos #legends  http://t.co/jxxLBH1xeB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits Benteke &amp; Mitrovic! Mignolet clean sheet wouldn't go amiss either!! #FPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc I only saw last 10 mate tbh but saw enough of him! He needs to learn humility!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And how does a player on a yellow paddy like a 3 year old, tell the ref to fkoff &amp; not get sent off?! #poor #FA #referee<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cyclingweekly Any chance of you starting a campaign against the widespread road resurfacing with chippings?! #Yorkshire #dangerous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KirkleesCouncil Do you have any idea how damaging &amp; dangerous road chippings are for cyclists?! #disgraceful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These new @castellicycling #armwarmers are amazing! Typical summers day in #Yorkshire today! Grey…  https://t.co/o8NgTmckJq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does @MyWakefield have any idea how damaging &amp; dangerous the chippings road surfacing is to cyclists?! #crazy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Doctor_Hutch When do you move out? #shewontbehappy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alabama_Lola @edsheeran What about his latest video though too?! Too much ginger cuteness in one place!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Keep those to yourself! Just started season 5! We were late to the party!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 I've not followed it for years but knew! The Rock told me on IG!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Just in from work! What's he done?! And how did you not know about Dusty?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Why?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kingkongsthumb Bessie's!! Taught him all he knows mate!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@highfielder80 @chrisfroome @rapha Probably! There's no way I'd sell something like that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If only I were there to pick up that @rapha rain cape that @chrisfroome has just taken off! And for it to fit obviously!! #homeofcycling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is hanging from #Nibali saddle?! #homeofcycling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfc_official I think somebody has forgotten to turn the lights off!! #Oakwell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior Me neither I'm sat waiting for my well earned burger before the pics!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FootbalIFights I think even @DannySm1th1 might have given this one! Do you @w4keysenior #blatant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anybody actually know why there is a 50mph limit on the #M1 near to #Meadowhall #Sheffield AGAIN!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior @Zoster79 @simonlovidge You wouldn't need more than 2 gears old lad!! #homeofcycling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@achrisevans @ZoeJordanStudio One for you @Zoster79<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CastelliCycling I can't believe it was a #Gabba morning on the way to work today! June?! I don't think so! #chilly but not on the inside!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCWalesSport @BBCMOTD @Jcollison31 Yeh cos Giggsy isn't a legend at all! And George Best was clearly pants! #rubbish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TotallyMUFC NO! He's an absolute liability! Guaranteed booking at best every game &amp; spends more time out of position!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EurosportUKTV This is a genuine question! Do women shout 'Man On' at football when being closed down by an opposing player?! #WorldCup2015<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@everything_utd No but he is better than Rafael! #liability<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watched y'days highlights. Great to hear @carltonkirby call an effort like that! And what an effort it was @Petekennaugh #superb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just seen the new @edsheeran video for #Photograph The song as always is ace but the video is different class! #awesome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Footy_Jokes @BBCSporf What's Spanish for Grow Up Boy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know he was caught up in the crash but why does Steve Cummings spend so much time at the back of the bunch?! #homeofcycling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EE I have no doubt it is but other providers include it! And it's a big plus point for them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great ride out this morning with these numpties! Ruined by a lump of a climb up #JacksonBridge right…  https://t.co/rXIUrDZVxi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andymortby Premiership before 45 mate!! #youneverknow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still find it hard to believe that @EE charge for Internet use abroad! With other providers it's just your normal contract! #poor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got to love @TheRock The mans just tremendous! @SanAndreasMovie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@100Climbs Is that the prediction Simon?! I'm going for 55.something! #gowiggo #HourRecord<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@petatodd But where's the fun in that?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stevietrueblue @rosieofthejones We'll start a #getrosieahottub fund!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had a great journey home yesterday. Not that anybody wanted to come home! #top #holiday #France…  https://t.co/CpVh4JGAq0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Doctor_Hutch I think a sword would be more appropriate! #tothesword<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PaulSmithDesign In the sky! #definitely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has anybody ever seen #Suarez &amp; #FreddieMercury in the same room together?! #justsaying #UCLfinal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Giving #Pogba away for free has got to be @Furious_Fergie best bit of business ever! That and #Kleberson #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd love to give #Neymar something to roll about for! #tillmyfootbled #UCLfinal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkySports How has he been unlucky?! It wouldn't have hit two sets without hitting his hand! #UCLfinal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior Charming! #exbestmate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Only just seen the result! I'm away in France glamping &amp; no wifi!! #thankfully #welldone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior Cool! I'd only be using the one club! The left handed one tends to shank stuff!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haha! This is ace! Got to have a go at this!! #top #idea  https://t.co/lRIy6qtjfo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@com_critica Loving it!! #not I just can't trust the man! Can't believe in him! If he's clean then he's awesome. #if<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@example Popular fella!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@example Still?! You sound like an old man!! Got to bring home the bacon now mate! #responsibilities<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@manutdnetwork At this moment in time #DaleyBlind is the best left back at the club. Not Luke Shaw! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it's fair to say that #SeppBlatter is the most disillusioned man on the planet! #FIFA #CorruptionFIFA #corrupt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@achatfield @Y0rkshirePudd 5 second rule if it missed!! #wastenot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the hits just keep on coming for the Scousers! Kolo Toure has extended his contract now!! #ace Be like #mufc getting Laurent Blanc back!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MufcDevilUpdate Blind is a better left back!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Honestly some football clubs are just a joke!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It might be as camp as Christmas but you can't beat #TopGun on @skymovies after a day at work!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@roadcyclinguk What you need to know is that the @GarminUK #Edge1000 might be pricey but it's awesome!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Furious_Fergie And a very good one!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Furious_Fergie 120million?! Last time I heard somebody come out with that rubbish it was only 50!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TotallyMUFC @HernandezJavier He could do a job in the reserves! That's two clubs now that thinks he's not good enough!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Only because I dislike Sherwood more!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Come on Villa!! #benteke #motm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@youngy18 @ManUtd I thought you were done Ash but you've been immense this season! Thanks for all the effort &amp; hard work! #awesome #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MufcDevilUpdate I bet Brucey can't wait!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carltonkirby That explains a lot Carlton! #justsaying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OriginalGMac Far too much thought! #standard We'll be going to watch it! Then going to California in September!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OriginalGMac After shock obviously!! #numpty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EamonnHolmes But I'm sure like myself &amp; most reds Eamonn you're feeling better about things than this time last season! #LVG #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timlovejoy I'm sure the spoiler should come first! Back to Game of Thrones now you've ruined it then!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Strike #WYCvSOU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nedboulting Maybe they should have run for Government Ned!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealStephens Good to see #RossGeller in the pink jersey Matt! I'm not a #Contador fan! #Giro #NoHiding<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vardy &amp; Charlie Austin?! Really?! Barrel scraping at its best! And no @youngy18 who is playing out of skin?!! #WTF #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyUK If I were to download a season of Game of Thrones before the cut off date would it disappear after that date?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the plus side I do like this #Sunderland away kit! #AFCvSFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the craziest sporting decisions ever! #Giro #SupportPorte<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The_OlaJordan It's your own fault hiding behind that bag!! Strictly catsuits only in future please! #fatmyarse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealStephens I'm confused Matt! What about the other day when a @BMCProTeam rider gave a @TeamSky rider a bottle? Unfair advantage surely?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimoClarke @PelotonWatch @richie_porte Punished for doing the sporting thing Simon! #Chapeau to you! #Giro #wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear @UCI_cycling The attached is what the whole of fans watching @giroditalia are thinking!! #haveaword   https://t.co/Q5HvkxwOE1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some crazy clouds this lunchtime on our way to #blackerhallfarm #weird #weather @ Woolley Edge Services  https://t.co/uF9Z9biWUP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@everything_utd I don't think you can say Blind faded. He's the best left back at the club &amp; for me can step in &amp; do the Carrick job. #class<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior Picked a good week to drop Hazard!! #fpl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArgosHelpers Just seemed to take forever. Not sure if it's new &amp; staff aren't up to spew yet or just a slower process!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GNev2 I'm not sure about Valdes Gary! Who do you think could replace De Gea?! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itvfootball Season!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedCityOfficial And a change of luke!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexdowsett One down. One to go!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cyclingweekly I've no doubt they'll make Sky regret not wanting to take them both on! #future<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Doctor_Hutch Not really sure I was Doc?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Doctor_Hutch Never mind Contador. What about the poor sod with his arm pointing behind him!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@100Climbs It wasn't! It was just pointing the wrong way!! Look!! #ouch  http://t.co/7uYKoHXZSP<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The mans an arse but #Tevez works his nuts off! #RMAJUV #mufc<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@giroditalia @davideformolo #Epic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@millarmind It would be like a footballer not playing in his testomonial! And it's not like you were dropped for somebody better! #poor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior Well done old lad!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkCavendish @Etixx_QuickStep Even better to see you leaving Sagan like he was pedalling through treacle!! #onfire<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Great to see LVG not messing about in the #FACup today! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just a quick note for @Zoster79 When you've been chopping chillies, best not to pick your nose anytime after!! 👹<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got a lovely Christmas pressie through the post y'day! Can't believe Santa took it to the wrong house!! Thank you @YLlewellyn x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MufcDevilUpdate Strootman &amp; a strong, quick defender who can play the ball out without looking very frightened! #ggmu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@everything_utd I'd be tempted to stick with McNair. Rojo when fit &amp; Jones. Evans' distribution has been shocking. On top of his 'defending'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCMOTD And they say United have a dodgy defence! Arsenal trying to get Arsene the sack! #shocking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Treat myself to a girly soap dish for my @rapha man soap!! #pressie #smellinggood  http://t.co/8RLxZWOe4w<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealStephens It does look quality. That time of year for the big films! Too many to choose from!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealStephens Excellent film Matt. Got to get at least an Oscar nomination!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealStephens I'll see your swanky Hotel movie &amp; raise you one about Stephen Hawkin!! #TheoryofEverything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits Strange??!! Didn't play Jagielka thankfully but then Chambers was missing &amp; I had Jags on the bench in front of Bruce! #ffs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2015 - Day 1. A trip to the @cineworld cinema of course! #TheoryofEverything is our first film of the year!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewH_1999 @ScholesyPaul Showed today with his finish &amp; work rate that he can be! And his attitude when brought off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScholesyPaul @AndrewH_1999 He is looking better mate. Think he'll have to stay fit till the end of the season now to stay beyond his loan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewH_1999 @ScholesyPaul He does. As does Falcao who was more shocked than anybody!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewH_1999 @ScholesyPaul Just thought it was a bit early at a time when we were controlling the game. That went with those 2 subs! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MufcDevilUpdate For who though?! Without a change of formation! Rojo straight in I agree. Can't drop Carrick or Mata.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nuri_3 @ScholesyPaul He's not even the best player in the reserves!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MufcDevilUpdate Not to labour the point but he's simply not good enough. Get him out on loan &amp; see if he improves. #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll take a point with that defence, in those conditions &amp; that performance. Crouchy was always going to be a pain in the arse today. #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good to see the next big thing coming on &amp; changing the game again! #Janujaz #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know things aren't good when I'd rather Ashley Young stay on than Rafael come on!! #liability<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScholesyPaul He's the next Ronaldo or George Best. Or something! #shite<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm struggling to see why he's taken Shaw off so early! Especially to bring Janujaz on. #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Managed to sneak another movie in last night to make 53 for the year! The @cineworld #unlimitedcard is the best value for money thing ever!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So close to the perfect start to 2015! Email from @TNLUK with news about my ticket!! £25 win! #lottery #notcomplainingtho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OriginalGMac Wow! Good effort.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Happy New Year everybody! Best Wishes for 2015!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Little bit jealous that @w4keysenior got to see #Queen perform live in their prime back in the day! Even if it was at Maine Road!! #quality<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Pezzer1878 I'm assuming the you in that is a collective &amp; not me personally cos I've always thought that Raphael is a liability!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I liking the sound of a bid for Seamus Coleman! Be good to have a reliable right back for a change! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Weird that this is the start of my last week as a #thirtysomething Just seven days till my 40 birthday!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That's awful @thejensie To do that to those poor animals &amp; then come back to burgle people! #shocking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C4NFL @NatCoombs A protective suit for RGIII to keep him injury free!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 I know! Girouds fault standing on Skirtel!! I bet Chelsea &amp; Shitty are shitting themselves looking at the rest!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so glad United weren't sucked into buying Lallana! He's pants. #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How does one of the trickiest midfielders in the country go from centre forward to left back??!! #LFCvAFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Haha!! I think it's in the bag now mate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Only seen last ten minutes! I think Walcott will be on! How bad must Lambert be for that little shit to be playing upfront?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“@pelotonmagazine: Holy shit.  http://t.co/ewPwF4dXZD” Oh my lord! #luckyboy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cyclingreporter @wielerman Well that's just even crazier! Surely a unique brown jersey would be better! Don't get me wrong I'm all for mud!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Calm down dear! The old quick equaliser!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wielerman @pelotonmagazine Not really sure why so many #cyclocross riders where white jerseys!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Thanks @Alabama_Lola I know somebody who'll love that to play with!! 😉 Have a good one! x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyFootball Should there be a pundit referring to a team as 'we' on the #SoccerSaturday panel?! The other boys don't! #tomoout<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alabama_Lola Loving the stamp! Where do I find one of those little beauts?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GNev2 It would have Gary but let's not forget LVG is ruining United with his ludicrous spending!! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MufcDevilUpdate Top reward for a top player! So pleased for @carras16 #class<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timlovejoy @KowalskiTV Have I read that right?! Are you coming to the best little town in Gods county?!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TransferSources It's not incredible. It's relative to his earnings. That's how it should be! #topidea<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BriSmithy Alternate delivery addresses never fail Brian! I've turned @w4keysenior into a part-time grumpy post master this December!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@citizenfishy Injuries?! Or more importantly any damage??!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits This is the week! I can sense big points!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior @simonlovidge He can be touchy though too! And he shouldn't be running in the dark!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior @simonlovidge Who by? He likes attention! Makes him feel special!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior Ha! Lots of potential as usual! Naismith will score tonight now I've flogged him!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Knob off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCSport Yes. He's immense! Easily the most underrated player of the Premier League era. Absolute class.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They're are two performers in the judges who aren't as good as @FleurEast This #XFactorFinal is a non-contest!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why was the male dancer crying up on the balcony @Lord_Sugar<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RobbieSavage8 Alex Higgins!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanJamesPoulter Great attitude! They look like mini versions of you, Jason Dufner &amp; Tiger!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on boys!! Today matters more than most!! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something is wrong at Carrington. Nobody can be this unlucky with injuries. There must be a reason. #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cineworld Now, all those within the sound of my voice, and on this Earth everywhere know that henceworth you will be called Santa Claus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timlovejoy That's a lot!! #notpossible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits Huddlestone!! He's in for Fabregas in my injury hit squad!! I think he'll get a brace! #not<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@saddleblaze No matter how much effort the majority of the peloton out in there comes a time when the #UCI must act! #failedbadly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits Awesome! Mini Pete Schmeichel is out for a month now too!! Roll on the January Wildcard!! #FPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ManUtdStuff_ Still not convinced by Jones mate tbh!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Why are @CostaCoffee cafes always freezing cold! Really no need for the aircon this time of year!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 I've not seen the game mate. Just seen the Ramsey goal on here! Does that make Stoke better than Galatasaray??!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Decent strike by Ramsey though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Podolski is the man!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCSporf If he was Italian or Spanish they'd love him. Most underrated player in the country! Absolute #class<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PJags06 @adidasUK I'd take @Zoster79 cos she's a massive blue &amp; used to have a season ticket but hasn't been for a while! #EFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've decided to limp through till the January Wildcard to make wholesale changes rather than waste one!! What's -4 or -8 points??!! #FPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As always @carras16 was immense last night! Dependable. Reliable. #class<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a scorecard not a report card! United are poor! United are 3rd in the league!! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>United poor. United outplayed. United lucky! It's a good job cos when everybody is fit &amp; firing on all cylinders you can get ready! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkySportsMNF Can I just point out it's a scorecard not a report card! Not all Fergie wins were breathtaking with attacking football!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScholesyPaul No I agree! Carrick is still the man for me. Mr. Dependable!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@everything_utd He looked sharper though too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScholesyPaul He's so frustrating though mate! Awful ball across midfield for there goal &amp; he should be bossing people not getting ridden!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's an idea! Why don't we stop giving the fekin ball away!! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it coincidence that #Pelle's dry spell was while he was in my #FPL team?! I think not!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@everything_utd Especially you SpongeBob! And if I see you lose one more header to a midget you've done!! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SpongeBob is having a mare. Mata isn't involved. Rooney looks like he's scared / not 100% &amp; we've already used 2 subs!! #woohoo #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4key7 In fact sod that I'll settle for full-time now!! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finish!! #RVP #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All I need to rescue a dire weekend is a Wanyana goal, a Bertand goal and a Mata hat-trick!! #easy #mufc #FPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@everything_utd Maybe Rojo is at left back of a back 4??!! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On a scale of 1-10 how big of a mare did the ref have in the City v Everton game on Saturday?! Two blatant assaults! #shocker #MNF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Travelled a long way south today with @Zoster79 and it's still freezing cold!! #roadtrip<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@robhillsdon86 @FFPundits Agüero sounds like long term so he's got to go. Might just 'rest' Fabregas for one game!! And Chambers! #decisions<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Yes mate. 1-0. Struggled to break them down but got the result! Easy game for us next up!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bbc606 @RobbieSavage8 #RVP isn't firing on all cylinders but the biggest disappointment for me is #Janujaz He's been really poor! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carras16 is simply #solid Composure &amp; class have been missing! Most underrated player of his generation!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm bored with fireworks now! #stopplease<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can somebody explain to me why my 4 year old son is watching #Transformers on the tele while I'm watching a funny footy match on the iPad?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pleased for @juanmata8 I'll be even happier if that strike keeps #Janujaz out of the team!! HE'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH!! #mufc<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior Very good! Get you with technology! I think I might give Naismith one more week after his strike tonight!! #fpl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior I think so!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits I think it's time for #Naismith to depart my #FPL team! More bookings than goals! Will #Sakho be fit?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScholesyPaul At OT or if he found John Terry with his wife?! #openquestion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zoster79 wanting to watch the #Everton game on tele tonight!! She's a good girl! #EFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior Done nowt for weeks apart from get booked! Sakho at West Ham can't stop scoring! Wilson is going to start for Utd apparently!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior Naismith is annoying! He going when I get chance!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior That's taken some sorting out!! Good effort though. Same forward line as me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior Yeh I've seen it! Very funny. Little fella will love that next summer!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior I am mate. It's January on #FIFA which means the transfer window is open!! Busy time for us managers!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GNev2 I think the art of defending is dead! Teams are too attack minded leaving defences exposed &amp; defenders to make silly mistakes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 That'll leave a bruise!! #shocker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior #SlippyG is on now! Anything could happen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior They'll probably win one nil! This French lad at CB is the next big thing apparently!! As far as defending goes! #Varane<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really hope this gets very embarrassing really quickly! #RealMadridvsLiverpool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc @BBCSporf @w4keysenior Unbelievable Jeff!! Bend over sir! #incoming<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dundee8cologne1 @C4NFL Haha!! I agree. It's been a long time since I first saw the #NFL over here! John Riggins &amp; @Redskins stuck with me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dundee8cologne1 @C4NFL @Redskins I agree but you can't deny there's natural talent there! Staying in the pocket might help staying healthy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C4NFL @Redskins Surely RGIII is the future! Just got to stay healthy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep! This is happening! Going to be a long night!! #advancedwarfare #boys #toys  http://t.co/wpXVvI4LDo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Good to see some quality miming on #xfactor How can she have a go at others trying to sing live?! #cheryl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@citizenfishy Is only beaten with farce that are Apple software updates!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Massive win for #Shitty Top performance against 10 men &amp; a defence with 2 midfielders &amp; 2 recognised defenders! Both 19!! #champions #class<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TotallyMUFC Preferably one with a brain!! But yes it was a decent performance!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How many fouls have #City conceded that haven't resulted in a booking?! #Zabaleta shouldn't be on the pitch for one!! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If a player who had already been booked got a 2nd yellow for time wasting while being substituted &amp; therefore sent off! What would happen?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior Happy?! I'll be over the blue moon with a point! #MCFCvsMUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TotallyMUFC I wouldn't pay #Smalling for a month &amp; #Januzaj is nowhere near good enough. He looks laboured &amp; dis-interested! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TotallyMUFC Good. He's shocking. #mufc<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FFPundits I'm thinking Costa &amp; Sissoko!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits Selling those two plus 0.7 I've got saved up gives me 20.5! And will be a -4 hit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits Haha! #Wonga<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits Sounds good but are you going to lend me the cash?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits I need some guidance from above to replace #Silva in my team! #FPL Struggling for inspiration! And I've got #Falcao #doh<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ScholesyPaul @ak47ms187 You're both sick!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd refuse to do the interviews &amp; pay that fine rather than answer questions about ridiculous decisions! #MOTD2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the #FA don't want to hear things that upset them, they shouldn't expect managers whose jobs are on the line to answer questions after!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 The advert in the cinema was enough for me!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And people say United can't defend!! Scousers are awful!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@everything_utd That sounds good apart from Januzaj not being good enough! Or at best so far failing to deliver! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Liquid gold! That's it for trips to the bar this week @w4keysenior We've plenty in the lodge to drink first!! #remortgage<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Haha! Top lad!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 So I suffered the second half &amp; you went out??!! That can't be right! It'll all be over for Chelsea by Christmas!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 What's the keeper doing there throwing the ball out to a marked player! And ruining my  Koscielny clean sheet! #tit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Yeh I'm not the greatest mate! More of a one man sniper killing machine on COD!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 In temper or are you freaky strong!! In the PS4 mate! Santa was good last year!! It's ace too btw!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 I did mate! It's pure fantasy! We beat shitty 2 nil last night!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Should I watch the 'big' derby game or just bob FIFA on??!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awful defence! Shocking start to the season! Back above LFC! When #LVG gets the defence sorted be afraid! Be very afraid!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarryMcMaster1 Odd!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarryMcMaster1 Very! Why sit up when you're not the strongest sprinter?! #bonkers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TotallyMUFC It's not the worst challenge ever but there was no need! #stupid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior Only shocking defences give away 2 goals apparently!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 I know mate &amp; I'll be amazed with a clean sheet! Good start though! Big game for you today!! #derbyday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 6-5 United mate!! Not as much as me with Jags in my fantasy team!! But yes she's not a LFC fan!! Or Gerrard it would appear!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Knew I should have given @LouisaVanGaal a call this week! Think I could have got a game! Like Lauren Blanc but slower!! #classy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going for 6-5 at OT today. United to win!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Just wrong! I bet she can't even find the hammer!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior I think he might play mate but wouldn't be surprised to see the same midfield &amp; front line as last week!! #decisionsdecisions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@100Climbs Kristoff!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Just watching #FootballGold on @SkySports where a United team under Sir Alex have thrown away a 3-1 lead!! #shithappens #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@everything_utd I'd be attacking that right side of the defence! One is a ticking time bomb the other is woefully lacking confidence!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PelotonWatch It's disgraceful! @BBCSport got the British rights to the Worlds and there's not been anything on! #eliteorbust<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very boring @franmillar Surely you can go and see some at the Worlds though! We've got to rely on @BBCSport and there incomplete coverage!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fizzer18 It's called media inflation Phil!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Funnily enough I though I'd grate my own knuckles until I got to my armpit instead!! #painful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkySports They've set out to rough #Costa up &amp; it's backfired! It was nailed on once the ref started flashing the cards! #CFCvMCFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carltonkirby And they chose to not show the TTT! #awesome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd still rather watch United! #MUFC #CFCvMCFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior @bryanrobson Not for the next 3 games old lad! We need to stop making schoolboy mistakes &amp; trying to play too much at the back!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I didn't think #FIFA15 was out till next Friday! Turns out it's out already &amp; on my tele!! #crazy #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Rafael is an absolute liability. I've got a 3 year old son who knows you should be goal side when defending! #tit #MUFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkySports Strange to see black football boots making a comeback!! #traditional<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@everything_utd I think it could be the difference between Ronaldo coming home or staying away! It's a must!! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fan_Manchunian @ScholesyPaul @AnderHerrera With one big difference! Ander can tackle! #mufc<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DannySm1th1 @w4keysenior Are you looking at the table upside down Smithy?! Or was it a ref's glance?! #FPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@everything_utd Since Ronaldo left. Born to play at OT! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fizzer18 Some people were born to do certain things. Angel Di Maria was born to play at Old Trafford. #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have I missed any 'Hoofing' of big gears so far today @RealStephens #eurosportcycling<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@simonlovidge No way mate. One he's shit &amp; two I'd wind him right up and out of the game! #inmypocket<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's no way Balotelli would finish a game if I were marking him! He'd either get sent off or stretchered off!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's clearly something wrong with the #yellowjersey at this years @TourofBritain Nobody wants to wear it more than a day!! #ToB #tob2014<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fish95A Does that mean Barnsley are better than United?! Or not?! I'm confused!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Who does #DiMaria play for again??!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior @11GeorgeBest It is this week the way he's spouting about United!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior @11GeorgeBest Good effort with Parker old lad!! With yours eyes especially!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time for a brew &amp; some of @Zoster79 white chocolate &amp; cranberry shortbread while we watch @BritishBakeOff #GBBO  http://t.co/Ul6m68hM6O<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it just me or is it starting to look like £59.7million well spent!! Just the two assists against the World Cup Winners so far!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc I still wouldn't have paid to watch them!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc I've not even bothered! I think the size of the crowd says a lot!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zoster79 @BritishBakeOff I don't think you've ever made us a pie!! #takenote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@100Climbs you were saying!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's causing all these crashes! So many this season! Is it the carbon wheels causing uneven braking?! #eurosportcycling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@parkerpointer I'm always here!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelenHfrr @GordonRamsay It is Helen &amp; really easy to make! Gordon's new book is full of stuff I want to make!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Out of all the new United team variations on here today not one of them has had #Fellaini in it!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tiraquon @GordonRamsay Haha! Yeh a little bit! My left arm is in a cast after an Op to pin a broken wrist!! #nothingseedy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had a one armed bash at making @gordonramsay roasted tomato soup with homemade red pesto &amp; Welsh…  http://t.co/xTPxBglEzv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior Been busy mate!! Some one armed cooking! Roasted tomato soup &amp; Welsh rarebit!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've just seen a United team on here with Fletcher in it!! #WTF I'm fairly sure barring injuries those days have gone! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have to say that on the whole impressed with the clearout that #LVG has sanctioned! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedCityOfficial @Arsenal He's being de-briefed / interrogated!! Finding out what he knows about Special Ops at OT!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I woke up to the possibility &amp; am now going to sleep with the reality!! That's some firepower!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fizzer18 You &amp; half the country Phil! Come on United!! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Desperate to sign Welbeck??!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Either #LVG has confidence in his defenders or thinks sod it we'll score one more than whatever you get!! #attackattackattack<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior @TotallyMUFC That job will hopefully involve a lot of Saturdays off now too. He won't even make the bench!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clint8301 @McClellanLufc He's got Roger Milla's passport!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Apparently he's on a flight with Vidal!! #nochance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Maybe Huntelaar??!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Basically you've finally got a striker with some potential &amp; in doing so are paying for our new worldy!! #cheers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TransferSources Just what you need @ak47ms187 A winger!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trimmtraber @mrjakehumphrey He's on loan for a year with a view to a permanent deal. And when did 28 become old?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YLlewellyn It's all gloomy when you leave Gods County!! #sunnyhere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrjakehumphrey Sometimes Jake you have to get things while you can?! RVP not looking as sharp. Building for the future! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Depends how much injury time he allows!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NOT_MOTD @ak47ms187 Unless of course one of your strikers needs surgery &amp; will be out for a while!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rioferdy5 @ManUtd I'd love a 20 year old Rio Ferdy but you can't get class so young nowadays!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is there only football clubs on #transferdeadlineday that still use fax machines??!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 What about Welbeck?! You could pay Falcao's wages for us!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryLineker I think the defence is a long term project! Some deals you just can't say no to!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And for those saying that #DiMaria was overpriced &amp; not wanted at Madrid! How did they go on last night?! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScholesyPaul Chuckling like a good  un here mate! Massive coup! Mid-table. No CL! And he's paid for by Hernandez warming the bench at Real!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Furious_Fergie It's the Kevin Keegan school of football!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 I thought that till I woke up. Can't stop giggling now!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc He's on his way back apparently!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 No not that desperate yet! It's getting to that point though mate. Might not be able to get the ideal man but need a striker!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Maybe you could hijack Torres to AC!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc I know!! It's the old Kevin Keegan school of football! You score 5 &amp; we'll score 6!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McClellanLufc That's not the point I'm making mate! So called big clubs in the CL have been chasing him. We were first linked y'day!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haha!! That mid-table club from Manchester have only gone &amp; pipped Arsenal, Chelsea &amp; the Dippers to sign #Falcao #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 WTF? What's going on?! I thought you lot were getting him?!! #shocker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TransferSources Have you guys all got holidays booked for Tuesday morning?! #redundant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MufcDevilUpdate Not good enough for United! That simple. Not bothered where he goes as long as he does!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Furious_Fergie Out for 6 months with a broken arsehole!! Oh how I would laugh!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Furious_Fergie Unless Ramos would fall over &amp; break something! Like his coccyx!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 No but at least then you'll know! No more waiting &amp; wandering! I get annoyed with all the media hype &amp; links!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Not seen it mate but not the desired result! Even with Giroud fit though you're light up front!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 At least we are in transition! Again!! What's your excuse??!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior @Zoster79 Get out of bed &amp; have a look!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh dear! #Hart That is all!! #shittycity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@100Climbs Surely there's some floodlit climbs out there!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarryMcMaster1 Haha! Looking really rough mate! Her not you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it just me or is Mel B getting more like her Bo Selecta persona?! #XFactor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@100Climbs To be fair though Kenya is one of those lesser known African nations!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awesome video @millarmind Not for @taylorphinney obviously! #suffering #effort<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I find it hard to believe that there's a bidding war for #Cleverly &amp; that somebody wants to part with good money for #Torres #bonkers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carltonkirby Surely he's riding without due care!! Looking down all the time! #coincidence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TotallyMUFC De Jong until Strootman is available! Cheap, strong &amp; plenty of experience! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@evilkagawa Shred your passport Shinji! Don't go. Don't leave us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior @PremierInjuries I've read somewhere that he'll be fit for the weekend mate! #unfortuneately<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@petatodd What are you planning now Peta?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DIYSOS is absolutely awesome &amp; #Noah just the most amazing little boy! #inbits<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior I think it's all the success mate! They've jumped on the bash United bandwagon! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How good is @Zoster79 Told been told to check my Kindle library &amp; she's only gone &amp; bought me the @100Climbs book!! #quality<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MufcDevilUpdate Yeh he does look strong! We still need a CB. I think Strootman will come in January too. #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MufcDevilUpdate Any of the midfielders we've been linked with when we've got Herrera!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watched this weeks #InCycle on @SkySports with @laurenstendam Seems like a top bloke &amp; a great cyclist! #chapeau<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MufcDevilUpdate It just seems like he's wanting players when we've already spent money on similar!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MufcDevilUpdate Do you think we would have signed Herrera &amp; Shaw if LVG had been installed earlier?! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonBradbury @hemal @isaach Superb!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Much better viewing on @SkySports 3!! #Maria<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 And Bayern Munich!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Can't keep missing chances mate! They'll get at least one chance! x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have a word ref! #farcical #ARSVSBES<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 twitchy bum time now! Do away goals count at full-time or after extra-time?! Hehe!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior I know mate. Just seen that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BritishBakeOff The last thing you want is a 'massive spotted dick'! #GBBO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 I do!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How can Bouhanni complain about anybody?! Short memory syndrome! #dangerousdave #eurosportcycling<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MUnitedGirl @EamonnHolmes Can we oh back to 1999 please?!! #happiertimes #spoilt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedCityOfficial They clearly weren't watching tonight!! #poor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 Just a bit. Some disgraceful performances tonight I'm afraid!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ak47ms187 About 3 hours ago please!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedCityOfficial Haha!! Just a bit mate! Some players pinching a living &amp; disgracing the shirt!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MufcDevilUpdate A fekin joke! Some of these are a disgrace to the shirt. #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior It doesn't happen often but agreed old lad!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder if @ScholesyPaul is anywhere near Milton Keynes tonight. Go &amp; put a foot on the ball &amp; pick a pass! #ffs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some of these were probably aggrieved at being picked tonight. At the minute they're proving why! #woeful #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somebody tell Hernandez he really isn't that good! Just keep it simple idiot!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@evilkagawa is a play-a-maker! Not a ball-a-winner!! One challenge &amp; concussed!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How the hell is that not a booking?! I'm all for letting the game go but come on ref!! #MUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FFPundits Giroud out!! New striker wanted! All applications accepted! #FPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w4keysenior @simonlovidge Does the week 2 league table 3rd place win anything?! #justsaying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@100Climbs Easily the worst road in the country!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And they say United can't defend!! #shocking #MNF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1994JBuckton @MufcDevilUpdate Good! The more I see of his performances the more I think he'll be quality!! #mufc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MufcDevilUpdate Cos our lot aren't bothered about facts. They'd rather just make stuff up or speculate! #mufc<|endoftext|>
