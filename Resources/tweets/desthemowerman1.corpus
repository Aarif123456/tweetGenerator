<|startoftext|>@SusanKelly18 @CamAnalytica @BBCNews This story is so dumb. Democracy is all about isolating groups of voters and targetting them. Every constituency office has a list of every house and it's likely vote. Just propaganda from the BBC Remainers. Sighs deeply ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any respect I had for @BBCR4Today has evaporated. It's a pity. You can be very good. Your attempts to undermine the referendum result are shameful and on a par with the activities of the Kremlin. Worst of all, you are patronising, patrician and hubristic. Adieu.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every time I looked at social media I was blasted with dire warning of financial disaster. Did that sway me? No. It's called having free will in a democracy. We understand that all sides employ propaganda at every opportunity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCR4Today - take a look at yourselves. I voted leave to be rid of a nascent superstate whose primary purpose is to abolish nations. The PM, Chancellor and much of the media told me every day - with the aid of millions - that I was a fool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the explitic accusation in the feature was that Leave employed propaganda similar to the Nazis! Simply breathtaking. Was not @BBCR4Today doing precisely the same - trying to rally its Remain listeners by labelling Leavers as a group beyond the human pale?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>... that you don't draw lessons from the Nazis. How stupid was this person? We've drawn all sorts of lessons from the Nazis including rockets which got us to the moon and more controversially, major medical adances. (contd)<|endoftext|>
