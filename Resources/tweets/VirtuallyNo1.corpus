<|startoftext|>Trumpism is a terrorist movement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One wonders why the President, the leader of the US, wants to overturn the will of the people he's meant to serve.  It's almost as if he's really just an anti-American piece of shit.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm just waiting for the absolute dumbest people in America to claim this is fraudulent when Trump's "lead" goes away. #ElectoralCollege  https://t.co/7OIEbxm9wT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rt'ing for "Tang Satan". LOL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Help GA! Vote @ReverendWarnock and @ossoff! Save our country from Moscow Mitch and the #SeditiousGOP !!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who fired this Chris Krebs guy when he could be really useful right about now?  Oh, right... the National Security weakening buffoon in the White House fired him because he was butthurt Chris wouldn't lie for him about fake election fraud.  Trump is a fucking idiot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing to see, just the President ordering a Governor to suppress votes.  Trump's anti-American behavior demonstrates each day why he isn't wanted, and what a danger he is to this country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting "rebuked in the name of Christ" by this dirtbag is a badge of honor.    Grats Beth. Thanks for speaking out when human slime like this is busy perpetuating lies and fear in the name of Jesus, for cash.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/neqPggtvxQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So when this doesn't happen, are a bunch of people going to ask for pillow refunds... orrr?  Seems like a requirement for being a Trump supporter is having absolutely no memory for what you're promised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sane people might notice he's just running through a list of Democrat cities and what he says is fraud is really just DEMOCRATS VOTING.  That's how elections work. Republicans don't like it because Republicans are lying fascist goons who would rather cheat than be good people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am a Bidenist, in the Church of Bidenism. Once a year during the week of Biden's birth, we make a holy pilgrimage to Scranton PA.   There, we spend the week meditating on the question: "What is Bidenism? Fucking lol. Bidenism isn't a thing."  https://t.co/JYV7KUIdGb<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yes, Newt is trash and always has been.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BethMooreLPM Beth, it looks like the Trumpers and fake christians are going to give you a hard time. Thanks for speaking up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We were raised to pray on Thanksgiving.  Anyway, no one wants to cancel Christmas or Thanksgiving. There's no globalist socialist agenda to cancel Christmas or whatever nonsense these people are programmed to fear. This reads like deflection from Trump's coronavirus failure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#KeepChristmas Christmas is fine. See the picture below if you think otherwise.  https://t.co/uXvjEH0f8x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a pretty Christmas tree up with decorations, a wreath, and lights outdoors. What's all this absolute horseshit about Christmas being in danger? #Christmas  I want to know what is pumping these people full of imaginary things to fear.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>There are serious problems with gun violence in the US. We need solutions that make sense, and don't just give us new ways to jail nonviolent people for not paying a tax. /End.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's gun murder statistics: 4% for assault rifles. 67% for handguns. Not including suicides.:  (When I said ~97% earlier that was based on memory, probably including suicides.)  https://t.co/kWhN0bpZ5a<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The idea that handguns are ok because they're "defensive", but also responsibe for almost all gun deaths, makes little sense to me if people are truly concerned about gun violence and not just obsessed with "assault" rifles.  Gun control like bans in certain public spaces = ok.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hell. Charge a one-time $1000+ tax for assault rifles if a tax is needed. Annual tax just gives a recurring way for the government to make you a criminal for doing nothing. Generally affecting the poorest people. 2/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is that yearly? If annual, are you in trouble if you don't pay the tax? Seems awful. I'm all for point of sale tax or even bullet sale tax if you want to tax. Annual, no.

<|startoftext|>See if this is just a fundraising scheme, they're going all out. Really, start calling this a coup attempt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @GSAEmily did you do your job yet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People are saying what President Trump and the GOP are doing with "election fraud" is just a fundraising scam to milk their moronic followers for money.  Yes, it is. It's literally in the donation fine print.  But that doesn't mean he's not trying to do worse things than that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm right there with you Sandra.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did he see the electoral college votes and the vote counts? Because this is some coup level denial of reality and the will of the American people.   This isn't a close call like 2000. Seems like something more sinister, illegal and anti-American is happening with the GOP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden @TeamJoe Trump is attempting a coup. Don't let them do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a coup. It isn't close. Call it what it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes coup.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is a coup. The faster we all get on the same page the faster we can fight back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kemp is trash.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This. Assume the worst. "He won't be that bad. He wouldn't do that." Is not a position to take with Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a coup.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People thinking the GOP senators and Trump are not both conspiring to do really bad things to America and Americans are fooling themselves. This is an ongoing coup by the GOP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty sure he wants to put a yes-man in the DoD for evil things he's about to do.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi @HouseDemocrats He's going to kill us all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi can you impeach Trump right now? Because, he's going to kill us all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's really going to try to overturn the election in many states. He's really trying to do it.  Now is NOT the time to assume he won't do terrible evil things.  If this was a perfect country, the military would be dragging him away in handcuffs right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reading rightwing posts- they genuinely think Trump won (No), SCOTUS should overturn the election, and Trump should use the insurrection act.  Why is this relevant?  Trump frequently gets his ideas from rightwing social media.  Expect some evil shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's almost as if Trump is a really bad guy and doesn't get along with people charged with defending this country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, whatever, but now you don't have a guy who opposes the use of US troops on civilians.  Remember Trump has no low he won't sink to.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ksorbs Proud boys were attacking people yesterday. You also tried to kidnap and kill a governor. You also tried to deliver fake ballots to Philly. And on twitter a lot of you seem to want civil war.  So what I'm thinking is you all need some cult deprogramming.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>*cough* GeorgiaSenate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, well, they're all complicit traitors so that sounds about right.    Someone ask them how they got their jobs, since apparently they have no respect for election outcomes unless they win. Ask them if the people who got less votes than them were really the winners.<|endoftext|>

You fucking know the real reason your lead went away. AMERICANS' VOTES WERE COUNTED.   Fuck you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN @ABC @MSNBC @AP #CallTheElection before some vote counter gets gunned down by a crazy Trumper.   How does Trump have a chance of winning with these numbers?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Media,   #CallTheElection<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a viral republican video of having to watch the PA counts with binoculars. Look, they're right behind them.   There's even a video of the republican lady in red saying she's seen no foul play.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People in working in PGH left early to avoid the drama unfolding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Allegheny county PA will begin adding to the counted ballots at 5PM EST. This should continue to increase Biden's lead in Pennsylvania.  The ballots were legally required to wait till now to be counted and it has nothing to do with fraud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where is Presidential integrity? What happened to it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CALL IT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I mean, was he saying "sorry" too? Cause he's in the party of people who prevented it. The republicans of PA are to blame for the delay. That's just obnoxious hearing it from Toomey without a statement of ownership and regret.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It looks like twitter has stopped offering a live feed of Trump's dishonest denialfest.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Democrat vs. Republican in a nutshell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was a mixup from trump supporter owned printing company, by the way.  Resurfacing now.  There's no foul play, it's delayed because they're being CAREFUL not to vote twice.  GOP sued btw to toss the corrected ballots, because they're democracy hating assholes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@USPoliticsPoll My napkin math on this with speculative %'s  has Biden lose by 278 votes. You have to remember to add votes to Trump as well.  All that really means is this could be really close.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WomanInScience_ @HillaryClinton Sorry you hate voting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gingrich is a sack of shit and always has been.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It would be funny if everyone is watching Nevada and Georgia sneaks in for the Biden win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PA looks good. Nevada looks good. Georgia is looking good and Trump just hit them with a lawsuit, which is a good sign. Potentially Biden 306 to Trump 232.  Trump could always just give up and save the country the pain of lawsuits and his conspiracy crap.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>No one is buying this except for the particularly dumb members of Trump's base.  Donald Trump will go kicking and screaming, ripping this country apart as much as possible in the process.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing to see, just Trump determined to make this transition as painful as possible for the people of America.  Just like the past 4 years have been.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bamableu PA is trending very well to go blue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I did not expect all eyes on Nevada for the 270.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reminder that these people don't actually like democracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wizard_Predicts "If that holds true" It won't hold if the absentee trend continues, they're  ~80% Biden and that's all that's left to count.   These were mailed/delivered before Nov 3rd. PA GOP prevented PA from counting until Nov 3rd so they could try to do this.  He didn't win. It's fake news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump That's a big fat lie.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's so sad we have to do this.  Please donate to the Biden Fight Fund. 🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah. My napkin math a few hours ago was 44k win for Biden when 70% of remaining mail-in votes are Biden. Optimistic here about PA currently.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>LOL  Rightwingers- Take a couple mental health years. Shed the qanon mentality. Maybe go to night school or something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As of right now. If Pennsylvania's remaining votes to be counted went 70 to 30 in favor of Biden, Biden would win by about 40,000 votes.  Rough numbers and estimates, the point is he could definitely win.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@atrupar " people wanted to get their ballots in, they should have gotten their ballots in long before that".     They did get them in. PA is one of a few states that don't count ballots until election day so there's a huge backlog to go through.  Trump &amp; GOP know this. This is a BS scam.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar PA does not start counting mail-ins until Nov 3rd. It takes time to count votes.  PA GOP blocked the attempt to count them early. If they truly cared about less delays they wouldn't have blocked it.   They just don't want votes to be counted.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>"Trump will be ahead on election night," is very possible. It takes time to count the backlog of ballots.  PA is not allowed to count mail ballots until Nov 3rd (thank the GOP for blocking early counting.)  It is so obvious that Trump will try to declare a false victory.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Mail-ins don't get counted in PA until Nov 3rd because the PA GOP blocked the effort to count them early.  YOU DON'T GET TO COMPLAIN ABOUT DELAYS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to keep bringing this up:  PA GOP blocked the attempt to count mail-in votes early. So they don't get to complain about delays.  Mail-ins don't get counted till Nov 3rd in PA, doesn't matter how early they came in, thanks to the GOP who really don't want voting at all.<|endoftext|>

Also, GOP blocked counting early Mail-ins before Nov 3rd in PA, so any trumper telling you "we can't wait too long" is a two-faced moron because their own party didn't want to count votes on hand.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So Trump and his team of lowlifes killed 145,000+ Americans so far. He wants all the schools to open while cases are surging so he can continue his killing spree.  https://t.co/O921tZjq28<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DHS_Wolf I love it when uninvited fascists, who are escalating tensions, putting people in the hospital and abducting people in rental cars, say people are "irresponsible."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reading tons of comments about protests in America, almost all of the "shoot and kill them" comments come from the rightwingers. What is the rightwing info-bubble teaching people? I realize they're not protesting something terrible like pottery barn being closed, but calm down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBPMarkMorgan Yep. We are seeing you politics put before public safety (and the Consitution.) This has to stop. Get out of Portland.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CBPMarkMorgan @CBP Graffiti isn't a valid reason for federal troops to roll in and start abducting US citizens. It's also against the wishes of local government.

<|startoftext|>@scottynukeop @outdoor_nerd @ryangrim People use these for hobbies, work, etc.  I don't think this dude had it for hobbies, and was clearly wanting to wreck stuff and not get ID'd,  but these are not super unavailable things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scottynukeop @outdoor_nerd @ryangrim I have to wear a respirator for work. Honeywell (North) 7600, possibly 5400 they look similar, probably not RU6500. Looks like organic vapor w/p100 filters.  These are easily available to civilians. 7600 has been not covid restricted on Amazon for months. It's $250.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vexwerewolf Lol and I'm blocked by Vex. Have a good day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vexwerewolf If that's the mask it appear to be it's like $100-$250 and $20 filter pair. I'd be surprised if it's popular with US police for riot situations. Not much comment on the rest of what's going on with that guy, but imo he's not exactly blending in and being undercover.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vexwerewolf I use a similar mask for toxic dust so I don't need a lung transplant. Looks like a honeywell full face with gas/p100 filter. Public can buy those (yes even during corona), it's not a special riot mask or anything, tho I see hazmat use it. Would wear for spray/projectiles...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@daviddeutsch610 I would not want to try to take the position that heat and sunlight do not have a disinfectant effect.  The idea that there's sunlight everywhere, indoors, in cars, in busses, in elevators, in nursing homes, 24/7 in summer and people don't move and carry this is absurd though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jejohnson322 @DHSgov This is an irresponsible summary. 30 seconds is technically "seconds" but a lot of seconds.

<|startoftext|>@rckiser @RyanMarino Yep.   I'm not real confident that a person seriously thinking about nebulizing hydrogen peroxide is even going to dilute it correctly (not that even 0.5% is a good idea.)

<|startoftext|>@gorskon @mercola I wish he'd stop with the Hydrogen Peroxide neb stuff because it really is dangerous. And the concentration didn't even turn out to be very low.  It's fine to not be mainstream with some stuff or whatever but self dosing and huffing oxidizers/bleaching agents is beyond that.  https://t.co/ZVrIM72oIb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mercola Nebulizers themselves have also been considered as possibly increasing risk of Covid-19/SARS transmission.  If you're thinking about listening to Mercola you should ask a real medical doctor about the things he says.   https://t.co/qS1pui3to9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mercola 0.5% is the concentration of H2O2 in carpet cleaner for removing stains nearly instantly.

<|startoftext|>@Septgurl28 @richardhine Fair is fair, but really look at the Feinstein transaction in more detail.

<|startoftext|>@keithboykin @maraleia It looks like the stock had not been doing great overall and they started selling when it looked like it was hitting new lows.

They should be mad at no tests and inadequate preparation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TrumpPressConference opening by Trump is rambling garbage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump It's good that people who listened to your 'it's just a flu bro' may social distance now that you're shouting out slogans several weeks late. Too bad we don't know how much infection there really is due to your complete failure. Good presidenting bro.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Oh god, please no more conferences with you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Emergency tweet from the White House bathroom as dow futures plunge following #WorstPresidentInHistory's #Pandumbic speech.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Looking forward to the audiovisual lobotomy that is watching you trying to deliver an address, and also looking forward to maybe getting to hear from competent people while you're not talking. #TrumpIsAnIdiot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABCNewsLive @SecAzar Coming from the CDC that stopped showing their total test count on March 2nd, and many reports of trouble getting tests/tested from healthcare workers and doctors, our high death to case ratio right now, reports of test rationing by testing for influenza first,etc... BS Azar!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Stop it with the hunches and flu narrative. Just have the medical experts give advice.  https://t.co/7MHBOH8sWT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't bring coronavirus to work or spread it. Don't listen to the idiot in the white house.  #CoronavirusOutbreak #Coronvirus #Covid_19 #CoronaAlert #coronavirus  https://t.co/5s93h43vWh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You could support education: -Learning advanced search syntax. -Understanding how search engines work. -Not assuming search results are showing you what you think you asked for. | I'm not sure how to teach empathy, but if we all did a better job of that I think it could be good.<|endoftext|>
