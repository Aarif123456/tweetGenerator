<|startoftext|>The idea that handguns are ok because they're "defensive", but also responsibe for almost all gun deaths, makes little sense to me if people are truly concerned about gun violence and not just obsessed with "assault" rifles.

<|startoftext|>Reading rightwing posts- they genuinely think Trump won (No), SCOTUS should overturn the election, and Trump should use the insurrection act.  Why is this relevant?  Trump frequently gets his ideas from rightwing social media.  Expect some evil shit.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@scottynukeop @outdoor_nerd @ryangrim People use these for hobbies, work, etc.  I don't think this dude had it for hobbies, and was clearly wanting to wreck stuff and not get ID'd,  but these are not super unavailable things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scottynukeop @outdoor_nerd @ryangrim I have to wear a respirator for work. Honeywell (North) 7600, possibly 5400 they look similar, probably not RU6500. Looks like organic vapor w/p100 filters.  These are easily available to civilians. 7600 has been not covid restricted on Amazon for months. It's $250.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vexwerewolf Lol and I'm blocked by Vex. Have a good day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vexwerewolf If that's the mask it appear to be it's like $100-$250 and $20 filter pair. I'd be surprised if it's popular with US police for riot situations. Not much comment on the rest of what's going on with that guy, but imo he's not exactly blending in and being undercover.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vexwerewolf I use a similar mask for toxic dust so I don't need a lung transplant. Looks like a honeywell full face with gas/p100 filter. Public can buy those (yes even during corona), it's not a special riot mask or anything, tho I see hazmat use it. Would wear for spray/projectiles...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NJShorePatch @cspan Sunlight at the 'direct sunlight' level isn't everywhere in summer, neither is heat.

<|startoftext|>@daviddeutsch610 I would not want to try to take the position that heat and sunlight do not have a disinfectant effect.  The idea that there's sunlight everywhere, indoors, in cars, in busses, in elevators, in nursing homes, 24/7 in summer and people don't move and carry this is absurd though.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mercola 0.5% is the concentration of H2O2 in carpet cleaner for removing stains nearly instantly.

<|startoftext|>@MysterySolvent Never. Go read Donna Drumpf Jr's twitter and you'll realize they're in their own 'dear leader' world.   He could bite the heads off babies on the WH lawn and they'd be angry at the press for questioning it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump 'Half Wit. Is way in over his "ahead". Doesn‚Äôt have a clue. Likes blaming everyone for his own ineptitude!' - That's you! That's what you do!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislhayes We stopped tuning in for them today. There's no point watching them anymore.   We were watching a horror movie this evening, thinking 'this is way more pleasant than watching a Trump "press briefing" Also less scary.'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Acosta Trump is a petty #ToddlerinChief<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Just have Fauci speak. Go hold a BS townhall on faux news every day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeAnna4Congress @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump President Cuomo has this bro. You're on a twitter hate spree this morning, feel free to be a leader whenever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Do it already. You're going to need those vents for the #EasterMassacre<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite (Armp Corps of Engineers) on Maddow right now seems very capable of helping to solve the hospital bed problems related to covid in New York and elsewhere.   "It inspires confidence" is right. It was good to hear him talk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish they would reverse these Trump press conferences. Have Birx &amp; Fauci go first &amp; answer questions, then I can turn this crap off and watch Cuomo tomorrow. #TrumpPressConf #DoctorsOnlyPressConferences<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BodhiSwayze3 @briantylercohen @realDonaldTrump Maybe just people who don't want to accidentally kill your mom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SethAbramson Tuned in and couldn't watch more than 3 minutes of this Trump propaganda TV.   Really concerned for our healthcare system, high risk population and ANYONE who needs care for any serious condition if our hospitals get overloaded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LTrotsky21 @SusanLouise1977 You might not be counting the extra deaths if our hospitals can't handle capacity and treat other things like heart attacks, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FISH TANK CLEANER  Chloroquine was the drug named by Trump 3 days ago in press conference (google it.) Chloroquine phosphate is used on fish AND as a human anti-malarial. They're the same drug just different quality requirements.   Irresponsible to act like it's a miracle cure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalebJHull It's the same med, possibly not pharmaceutical grade. It's antibiotic on fish, it's not soap or glass cleaner. You should be expressing outrage at self medicating (based on a moron blasting it out as a miracle cure on a massive platform.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @nytimes That was accurate. Especially the "bungling, chaotic and dishonest" part. That's all you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrLawsonNP Bandana recommendation is dangerous for the public too. There's a strong tendency to lift it up with you dirty hands by grabbing the front and inside the bandana. There's no elastic, they stretch and they fall down constantly. Terrible PPE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Famous liar with lots of followers pushes miracle cure. Where has this been done before.  https://t.co/f1HLDsZ0kD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYGovCuomo This looks like a hypothetical way to turn a 3d printer into a simple ventilator. If the idea may be of any use in a shortage-  https://t.co/rbR6YEviQJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JordanKamer @NYGovCuomo @NYCMayor Ventilator splitter-  https://t.co/9aNWQ0iBrB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JordanKamer @NYGovCuomo @NYCMayor Another face shield option.    https://t.co/Gikrmx4hb0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBCInvestigates People with sewing machines, 3D printers  etc would probably like to help. It's unclear what hospitals would want/accept in terms of home crafted or printed items.  https://t.co/Gikrmx4hb0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump: 'the american people are looking for answers and they are looking for hope.'  Not false hope. Not lies.  #triggeredtrump #TrumpPressConference  #TrumpLiedPeopleDied<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fauci gracefully rescuing Trump from full blown meltdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fauci needs to always be at these briefings because he gives truthful info.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joanbet Feinstein doesn't look bad. Looks like they were dumping a single bad biotech stock. The timing was relative to how the stock was trending.  Dumping a cancer therapy biotech is an odd choice for a pandemic disease with higher death rate in cancer patients. What's their portfolio?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Septgurl28 @richardhine Fair is fair, but really look at the Feinstein transaction in more detail. It was a single biotech stock that had not heen doing well overall, triggered to sell when trending too far down. I wouldn't throw Feinstein under the bus to seem bipartisan or because "i don't like her."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@keithboykin @maraleia It looks like the stock had not been doing great overall and they started selling when it looked like it was hitting new lows. It was a single stock and presumably not their entire portfolio. This isn't obvious like exiting a briefing, dumping everything and buying citrix.  https://t.co/kuPAJZkStg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrierWHStaff This has been Allogene stock 5 year. Looks more like Feinstein was dumping a stock that had been going bad. Nothing so far seems especially strange with Feinstein's sell of this single company.  https://t.co/hSiKtUIZTn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alchemy363 @TwinklingTania @mrspanstreppon @SenFeinstein Feinstein sold a bunch of Allogene (healthcare) stock before it peaked and it's down from peak, but not tons from when sold. Kind of a strange choice for insider trading on coronavirus. They should look at it more closely than just saying 'big stock sale bad'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorLoeffler Just go directly to prison.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PerryNBCBoston @NBC10Boston They need to organize and announce approved 3D models. I can pull lots off the internet but I don't know what is ideal for medical professionals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To ppl saying "use a bandana" as PPE: Make sure you are not pulling the bandana up in the front with your dirty hands. Bandanas tend to fall and need adjusting. Don't lift by the part near your nose/mouth. Tie them tight. Not good PPE. Healthcare needs real PPE. #PPEshortage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Trump downplayed and lied constantly. Healthcare doesn't have the needed equipment, risking all lives and ability to fight. There have been terrible testing delays, making the "invisible enemy" even more invisible for too long. #TrumpLiedPeopleDied   https://t.co/OuPXKF6fYy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Lies lies lies. You downplayed and covered it up constantly and it's all recorded. #TrumpLiedPeopleDied #TrumpVirusCoverup   https://t.co/xiHQa00QRl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiNurse I see so many people mishandling bandanas by pulling them up in the front. And they fall down and need lifting often. If you have virus on your hands and handle the front of your bandana, you could easily infect yourself. Be careful handling makeshift mouth coverings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chuckwoolery Coronavirus IS spread by air. Search coronavirus aerosol. The advice that general public don't wear masks is based on things like misuse of masks, shortage,etc. Healthcare/police are face to face with sick people frequently and we need them to NOT get sick, and also not transmit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mikel_Jollett Judging by them complaining about "fake news" and "communists" being the cause of government mandated temporary closings of various businesses/schools to reduce coronavirus spread, I really doubt they will turn on him. They should be mad at no tests and inadequate preparation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TrumpPressConference opening by Trump is rambling garbage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump It's good that people who listened to your 'it's just a flu bro' may social distance now that you're shouting out slogans several weeks late. Too bad we don't know how much infection there really is due to your complete failure. Good presidenting bro.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Oh god, please no more conferences with you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Emergency tweet from the White House bathroom as dow futures plunge following #WorstPresidentInHistory's #Pandumbic speech.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Looking forward to the audiovisual lobotomy that is watching you trying to deliver an address, and also looking forward to maybe getting to hear from competent people while you're not talking. #TrumpIsAnIdiot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABCNewsLive @SecAzar Coming from the CDC that stopped showing their total test count on March 2nd, and many reports of trouble getting tests/tested from healthcare workers and doctors, our high death to case ratio right now, reports of test rationing by testing for influenza first,etc... BS Azar!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Stop it with the hunches and flu narrative. Just have the medical experts give advice.  https://t.co/7MHBOH8sWT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't bring coronavirus to work or spread it. Don't listen to the idiot in the white house.  #CoronavirusOutbreak #Coronvirus #Covid_19 #CoronaAlert #coronavirus  https://t.co/5s93h43vWh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You could support education: -Learning advanced search syntax. -Understanding how search engines work. -Not assuming search results are showing you what you think you asked for. | I'm not sure how to teach empathy, but if we all did a better job of that I think it could be good.<|endoftext|>
