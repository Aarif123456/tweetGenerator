<|startoftext|>@qikipedia I suspect this is a standard Bullingdon Club rites of passage to becoming an MP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm all for this - the opinion of #BorisJohnson shouldn't be accepted over-and-above actual evidence  Too many times recently, Johnson has said that there's "no case to answer" yet has no proof as to why.

<|startoftext|>Does this new-found commitment to #obesity from @BorisJohnson mean his weekly weigh-in on TV so he can be seen to be leading the way in this new campaign?

<|startoftext|>@RussInCheshire Maybe you got the £10bn from all the other public sector contracts that Serco have screwed up?  I recall a correlation between a rise in hospital infections and serco cleaning contracts?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes the Trumpian model of constantly being crap so that the brains of the electorate simply closes down is impressive  @RussInCheshire nobly wrestles with all the shite and makes it simple for us to grasp: @Conservatives are scum  Good work fella<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The Cure glasto set is up and running... and so's Radiohead...!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Based on the last few years of #Trump this is probably a snapshot of #BorisJohnson telling Farage... "well, this is awkward... fancy sneaking off for a pint?"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now that @Conservatives feel that the 1st wave has passed, they can return to their scummy ways  The great thing is that at least they can be open &amp; honest about their disdain for anyone who saves lives rather than have to pretend like they did March-June 2020  #SaveOurNHS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just in case the vile #racist comments of @TheaDickinson were missed - this is how it feels to have @Conservatives arms safely around us  https://t.co/Bw74AlYrYe<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pankazbansal @circleindigoGA The sign of a great manager is the state of the team that he leaves behind<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@circleindigoGA I wonder how long before he praises the players, names players he doesn’t rate, blames the fans, complains about fixture congestion, starts to look haggard and greyer, waits for a payoff, slinks away and sits on the sidelines bitching...  #MourinhoOut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@circleindigoGA Maybe you’ll remortgage the ground to pay over the odds for players who then quit when your Mediocre One alienates then all for the sake of his fragile ego  On the upside... erm...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#WALvAUS the gong goes... holy hell... well done @Andi_Roberts you played well there!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Japan punishing #Ireland and their lackadaisical ways - great to watch - Japanese speed; Irish mistakes - brilliant game - will Irish be prodded into action? #JAPvIRE #bbcrugby<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s almost as if the lead representative of the government @BorisJohnson is being accused of being a lying, conniving, vicious dick who puts his personal gratification and wealth before the wellbeing of an entire nation  Which is a fair point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So cool to see #Japan playing a blinder in first half - ball moving fast and so much energy  #Ireland need to slow the ball down... a danger that Japan can nick this!  #JAPvIRE  https://t.co/TZbaW6DEhF<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@circleindigoGA You’re one of the leading #facilitators in the world - I’d say that’s not something everybody does (and probably less than 1% of bosses do)?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This pretence at genuinely listening can be better addressed by more non-directional questions coming from the room and to have anyone *except* the person ‘in charge’ paraphrasing as people are more comfortable in asking qualifying questions and then disagreeing with a colleague<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have to disagree with this - paraphrasing and summarising tends to be carried out by the ‘person at the front’ who is fine with being corrected once or twice if their understanding is wrong - most people will eventually just agree with the summary to get things moving on<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Latest @iafenglandwales #facilitation #meetup in #Oxfordshire - a chance to chat about @lsusers and building corporate relationships - all good!  https://t.co/arTwlCfzM8  https://t.co/Y1dXSOv8LO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today’s Monthly Oxfordshire coffee meetup for ⁦@IAFacilitators⁩ ⁦@IAFEnglandWales⁩ is at ⁦@herb_centre⁩ - start 11:00  https://t.co/zbmjHdkwFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another nice chunk of the book down - much easier to write about what you enjoy doing, can add client value, are considered to be good at (!) #team #communication #Ikigai #writing @LLQiBook<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robertsrobson Get Joe Pasquale to dub it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robertsrobson I put mine out to tender on peopleperhour - had a speaker reel done within a weekend that included video, stills, testimonials and soundtrack    https://t.co/wNMW7CiCFW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InitiativeQ is a new currency built by ex-PayPal guys, currently given for free. If Q becomes a leading payment network, economic models estimate the reward would be around $130,000.  You just need your name &amp; email to reserve a spot.  By invite only:  https://t.co/ymrdocuMmi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some of the fallout from @IAFacilitators @IAFEnglandWales #FacWeek is that I have a list of actions for my own #CPD as well as how @EskilCo moves forward - not to mention more networking! Brilliant weekend with some decent cake from @HTFacilitation  https://t.co/KZnoxO7sog<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@circleindigoGA @FacWeek @IAFEnglandWales Oh NOW you mention the beer...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Great #FACWeek activity already  including #coaching #teaching &amp; #facilitating - not to mention investment in my own #CPD and working on @LLQiBook - tomorrow is the big Birmingham event with such luminaries as @martingilbraith @HeleneJewell @HTFacilitation &amp; @circleindigoGA  https://t.co/WB1Kyzsv3z<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty pleased to have got 5,000 words on the page today as I’ve laid the foundations for @LLQiBook - successfully annoyed leadership development people in the process.  Today has been the gift that keeps on giving!  https://t.co/D0tBzWVCyz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fuchsia_blue Such a special little unicorn princess...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CecyMomoh Well that goes without saying 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Andi_Roberts I’m certain that I’ve seen a video showing large scale logo blocks as a way to build the walls in an apartment - probably Japanese as they are wonderfully bonkers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Andi_Roberts  https://t.co/cvzmMtA20I<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Andi_Roberts Do you want me to buy you some?  Six bricks (4x2 in size) gives you 915,000,000 combinations - that would keep you nicely busy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyceMatthews_ I admit that I’m a sucker for a good pen...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#FacWeek   Being a #facilitator isn’t all casinos, jets, cocktails and intrigue...  Sometimes we have to clean our #LEGO, check the pens, review the stock levels of Post-It’s and practice our arts &amp; crafts  Luckily I have “help” when it comes to LEGO  https://t.co/z0Td2PQkEF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#FacWeek  Very cool session yesterday with a #UK #manufacturing company as they explored what #sales will look like as a function in the next 18 months - a very animated 90 minutes with the sales #director getting his voice heard in a boisterous #boardro…  https://t.co/q1lQ22Ksvy  https://t.co/qsxO7Z0Dvn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At the heart of ⁦@LLQiBook⁩ is #empathy - you are unable to have a balanced, non-directional, genuine exchange if you aren’t aware of your own feelings but also unable / unwilling to empathise with others - do you listen to what’s being said above and below-the-line?  https://t.co/wvb2rqEfI7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ESPENG soft goal, bit of bad marking... dig in lads!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3-0 is a fairly good first half... can't really complain about that :)   Top work by Sterling  Just need one more to make sure we don't balls it up with a Spanish comeback!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HeleneJewell Well at least you know what you’re getting for Christmas...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@circleindigoGA Okay okay okay okay...  195 tea light candles and 9 taper candles ‘for emergencies’<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great evening exploring the possibilities of our 6-8 plan of relocating the business to mainland #Europe - late night, early morning!  https://t.co/3jkbiDodpQ  https://t.co/JVWcCMJHnX<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CecyMomoh Don’t worry 😀  When back in office I will log on and send the questions for your forthcoming #team #facilitation - and the book is looking at a January publication but will send some copies out before #Christmas @LLQiBook<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kind of torn really... Dean Smith is a brilliant manager... yet he’s now working with John Terry at #AVFC - I feel like he will be contaminated...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting *insert organisation name* chit-chat about this &amp; (indeed) that.    Kind of reassuring to think that people manage to keep it together on a daily basis and not go crazy with a stapler &amp; some rolls of sellotape.  Reminds me why I don’t work in a government department!  https://t.co/8tssYVQUub<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting to hear about how #localgovernment &amp; #centralgovernment have broad cultural issues yet, in a #facilitated session, there are common views &amp; thoughts on a way forward - it comes down to old fashioned #communication   #LLQi - listen, reflect, communicate, behave<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanAmes Ah... I need to be in two rooms at once... #behaviour &amp; #culture - has anyone sorted out cloning yet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@circleindigoGA @HeleneJewell @martingilbraith @IAFEnglandWales @FacWeek @mikepounsford @pixlz @paulzj @billstaplesica @ICAAssociates Had firearm issues in Africa 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EskilCo has been providing business #coaching since the early 2000s - 1 of the key shifts is that its the latest shiny name (business growth coach, mentor, business advisor, critical friend) - every good business pays for a guiding hand at some point   https://t.co/kTkvOMh63L<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Andi_Roberts Oh you’re funny. 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just in case I forget my name... also I have advised responsible adults as to where I am for the day #delivercon18 #unconference #liberatingstructures #facilitation #publicsector  https://t.co/JH1zYcHHoh  https://t.co/YHxhBn80yD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HeleneJewell @martingilbraith @IAFEnglandWales @FacWeek @circleindigoGA @mikepounsford @pixlz @paulzj @billstaplesica @ICAAssociates I suspect @martingilbraith is the responsiblist one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t enjoy it; it’s the way my brain is wired and i can’t do anything about it...   I look at pages of text and only see typos... I like the image of a building seeping into history - sounds rather gothic and majestic... #stupidbrain  https://t.co/4dpb4z5NBa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HeleneJewell @martingilbraith @IAFEnglandWales @FacWeek @circleindigoGA @mikepounsford @pixlz @paulzj @billstaplesica @ICAAssociates Maybe your phone needs to only accept handwritten post-its and then digitises it into a tweet once it’s been signed off by a responsible adult...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HeleneJewell @martingilbraith @IAFEnglandWales @FacWeek @circleindigoGA @mikepounsford @pixlz @paulzj @billstaplesica @ICAAssociates Predictive text or something a little more subconscious?  Surely the phone learns YOUR words... so tell us, how many times have you used the word firearm on your phone?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HeleneJewell @martingilbraith @IAFEnglandWales @FacWeek @circleindigoGA @mikepounsford @pixlz @paulzj @billstaplesica @ICAAssociates Bringing a firearm to a facilitation session is probably frowned upon...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Over a coffee as we settle in, @pixlz gets mentioned, @LSusers gets mentioned... #smallworld<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gotta love a venue that is a) non-profit and b) serves up its coffee in mugs!  https://t.co/wfknwINjhQ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Found #DeliverCon18 easy enough - so a cheeky coffee and flapjack at ⁦@waylandsyard⁩ before the #publicsector #unconference begins  https://t.co/T6Bava69Pt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Early start off to #DeliverCon in #Birmingham - an un-conference designed for delivery professionals in the UK Public Sector.   Looking forward to developing skills that @EskilCo can apply with our clients.  https://t.co/Mm2TdDoMYd<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>With the evolution of #AI and how readily we embrace this technology, how long before integrated household tech spots when we’re feeling sad / depressed and provides #counselling or #coaching?    https://t.co/icMSl8hpgw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A key aspect of the #culture #change programme here: stick with it.  It’s not a quick-hit fad but a concerted effort to engage &amp; include all stakeholders in a new reflection of values etc.     https://t.co/zpD56q0tba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A day back in a cloistered space to work on the book - been a lot of discussion about sub-level (below the line) communication and how we react to it - and how that reaction creates new reaction.  Basically, if you’re picking up a vibe... listen to it #LLQi #communications  https://t.co/VhOmSmXlT1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Due to a shift in a client calendar, I now have October 17-19 free for a #UK #workshop - as the format has been designed, I am able to offer 1/2 day, 1 day or the full 2 day #management #development workshop with a 50% #discount.

<|startoftext|>Many things hold a business back from dazzling - one of the things @EskilCo does every year is ‘sack’ a client - an organisation no longer fit for our future intent. Recently letting a client go has resulted in more smiles in the office.   https://t.co/SI1IP1uvGf<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Big work on book today - interesting elements expanded upon including innerstate (reflecting on self-worth, beliefs, etc.), midstate (appreciation &amp; acceptance of true feelings &amp; how they impact), and outerstate (communication between you &amp; the other party) #LLQi @LLQiBook  https://t.co/GoP7Wuz3Ev<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Whilst blame has an immediate impact on those losing jobs, it is a key indicator of much bigger problems - losing focus on customer service as managers cover their asses - all driven by a #leader #culture   https://t.co/WsSJ1Yw3eR<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@martingilbraith @SOFacilitation @IAFEnglandWales @MartinFarrell @PilarOrti Brilliant - are there any webinars / virtual sessions being made available during #FacWeek for people to dial into (SO 1992) for brief introduction to @IAFacilitators, the art of #facilitation or even a ‘live’ 30 minutes for people to feel the experience?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has anyone in #facilitator land delivered webinars before (I am aware of @SOFacilitation in this space) - specific question in latest @IAFEnglandWales meetup is use of webinars during #FacWeek and the use of webinars to promote services and build engagement  https://t.co/jeKsiaTOo6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Question raised during the #Warwick @IAFEnglandWales meetup about #CPF - what has been the #1 benefit to being a Certified Professional Facilitator (for both client and as a #facilitator)?  https://t.co/CXdist7om1<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DreamscapeReiki @croatiaairlines Amateurish, to be brutally honest - they send us to wait for a few hours elsewhere - no contact, no update - just shut up like good little sheep until we load you onto another plane.  A weekend wasted because of this airline again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m not even sure why I bother to try to leave #Zagreb on a Friday night - a constant pain in the arse which, this time, includes late flight to #Munich and a hotel - so I don’t get home until tomorrow afternoon.  @croatiaairlines seems to be a general bag of crap...  https://t.co/4AP9dV8kAf<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I guess, as a #facilitator, I spend the end of every session (and days /weeks later) worrying if the content made available to participants has taken hold in any way.

<|startoftext|>What's going on with #Dubai #hotels?! I've been searching for a room for 1 adult and 2 kids... and EVERY hotel seems to be offering just 1 bed in a room.  So I thought... search for a room for 3 adults - same results.  Since when is this ever a good option?  https://t.co/Ecik69spIG<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>A great quote today from the @IAFEnglandWales  meetup that explains why you need a #facilitator - "the most difficult thing for a facilitator is to find the right question to ask" - sums up what we do... tools &amp; activities are lovely but we ask the right questions too!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MaraSvenne @circleindigoGA @ItsUnderstood From start of 2018 I began charging for preparation time as well as travel + #facilitation  - I spent &gt;2 years debating whether to do it or not (and probably subsequently lost work).

<|startoftext|>@circleindigoGA @Shindiggery1 @IAFEnglandWales @pinfacilitation My latest trip to Croatia, I took a batch of essentials in a very sturdy rigid plastic box... yet, to the credit of airlines everywhere, it arrived smashed! I admire the commitment to destroying property 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shindiggery1 @IAFEnglandWales A double-plot with sub-plots - looking for a case to carry a growing number of #facilitation stuff (most of my work is #international and airlines seem to delight in smashing cases); signing off a 3-4 hour #workshop to deliver to UK organisations for free (road-testing material)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyceMatthews_ In my experience... it's the buyers who just want to tick a box and say people had so many hours of 'training' with little interest in the outcomes (yes, I can give you a list of people guilty of this!)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoyceMatthews_ I'm a strong advocate of critical thinking - even 5 why's has been a revelation to many people I have been lucky enough to work with - there needs to be more challenge and a #facilitator can help with this process &amp; to keep room focus on defining problems before solving them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyceMatthews_ Self limiting beliefs has been order of the day as well as 'views without information / data are purely opinions and not facts' - Trump is proving to be a very useful #workshop tool for the #facilitator 😁<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JackMLeith @martingilbraith @IAFEnglandWales @lufthansa @pinfacilitation Are you saying that @pinfacilitation will supply a Neuland Yacht for me to sail the seas, delivering facilitated sessions to jolly pirates and sailors?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martingilbraith @IAFEnglandWales Well all of my pens are from Neuland - German excellence lost by German non-excellence of @lufthansa - would be awesome to have a jet and yacht from them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martingilbraith @IAFEnglandWales I think I need Facilitator One - a private jet with flipcharts and pens on board<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A 1st for me as #facilitator or #speaker - dumbass airline loses all luggage (clothes, workshop materials etc.) - so the client brings me toiletries, clothes, pens, pads, post-its... I had stayed awake reworking the 2-day session but it's nice to know that the client has my back!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lufthansa incompetence stumbles on... no booking staff in @bhx ; late flight; awful website; rubbish 'business class'; missing luggage... how about 'it might be on any of our flights to Zagreb so wait and see... if it arrives today, maybe' - all my work stuff... somewhere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have some politicians who have mastered the art of walking on their hind legs... species unknown  https://t.co/3Ec9eRfYMV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hold the phone... @lufthansa take incompetence up a level... delayed flight, chronic 'business class', almost missed connecting flight... And about 30 of us with missing luggage.  Could they be any worse?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the latest installment of "why I should remind myself not to fly @lufthansa " is their definition of 'business class' - paying extra to sit nearer the front in an economy seat is still economy - compare this business class to @qatarairways and see the difference!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As if they deliverately go out of their way to prove my point... @lufthansa delay the flight from @bhx_official to Frankfurt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just can't seem to grasp just how poor @lufthansa is - a website that's completely useless to access on a smartphone, empty desks so you can't check in (but they blame their supplier @swissport for that one) and I'm being warned that Frankfurt is rubbish to fly into!  https://t.co/pUfKfBBVFD<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MidlandsABP I'll be in my standard hoodie bearing a surly demeanour.  I will have crushed the carnation and let's it's petals fall into the gutter... the Birmingham rains washing them away...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bumbling into Birmingham on train - Golden Green by @thewonder_stuff highjacks my headphones - definitely a bit of multi-decade deja vu on the go... not sure if it's a wholly pleasant feeling cos life (rightly) moves on + on + on and the past should stay in the past...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like to think of it as more of a gentle hum... ah the bustle of #psychology brains oscillating under the influence of @Damascena_UK #coffee on a moody and evocative Wednesday in #Birmingham - I think rain under leaden skies would be a great backdrop...  https://t.co/NSLvo2j9Vt<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Pre-gig beer before @Covenant_Sweden and the footie is on... @DreamscapeReiki asks when did @Rylan start playing for #CFC - she still doesn't believe it's #Giroud that's throwing himself around like a thuggish baby #BarçaChelsea<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man alive, they just cut #CFC apart for that second goal... things could get messy!  https://t.co/CAUurCxSfj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not that they need my best wishes but come on @FCBarcelona - do a job on the blues!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All geared up for the much-anticipated @Covenant_Sweden gig with @DreamscapeReiki - sloe Gin has been drunk + drunk + drunk  - this band has a lot of meaning for us (not to mention we named our son after the lead singer!)  https://t.co/umcrEide0B<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>such Warwick organisations as @nationalgriduk @jaguarlandrover @IBM @telent_UK @CoventryBS @stwater as well as local government like @StratfordDC @DCEWarwickdc and @WarksDirect @nhsswft @Warwickshire_CC - repaying use of the facilities by free attendance for your staff!  https://t.co/1e6qZgsRLj<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>An article that helps me to understand just how smart the guys at @mQuBits really are...   https://t.co/sdL8InQQT9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gearing up to explore how @EskilCo can apply 'Language of #Leadership' in the #boardroom as well as across the wider organisation - focus on the power of ‘talk’ rather than force of personality - contact enquiry@eskil.co for #workshop details  https://t.co/LWNBCi0tzq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love that #LFC have their scoring boots on - here's hoping they stay as strong in midfield and miserly in defence in the next round #YNWA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well done @PrimozZupan - are you in the squad?  https://t.co/OSeTem0sv1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hi @elonmusk - our 4-year old son Mylo has been watching your #SpaceX launches on YouTube &amp; has just told us that he is going to be a pilot when he's older.  As you are inspiring his dreams, do you have advice for an enthusiastic rocket boy?  https://t.co/xrVZfI26OR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Busy old time in #London - will always love this city, I think.  Met with people, talked with people, sorted stuff out.  Time for a cheeky coconut vanilla latte and a big juicy muffin of obscene proportions.  I'm going in... wish me luck!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@VNV_Nation @Spotify @Covenant_Sweden I'm sure that all major sites are 100% entirely functional and stable and have no technology issues whatsoever.  We live in a cynical age. 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VNV_Nation @Spotify They also did it to @Covenant_Sweden - I was beginning to think that @Spotify just had it in for my musical tastes and that my playlists were about as stable as a Bitcoin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this part of a wider @Spotify conspiracy to drive @VNV_Nation deeper underground... or is there a pending VNV rebranding... or has Ronan flipped out and removed all tracks from existence?  The world's gone mad.  https://t.co/j9c2TMPD0u<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great meeting with chair of @EskilCo last night with a focus on #Croatia #MiddleEast #China and #Japan - post-Brexit inertia is driving our business to look to relocating and mainland #European office becomes more likely as a stepping stone to further afield!  https://t.co/PuNv780aiE<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Sad to hear about #CyrilleRegis - I was raised in 70s Black Country and remember the racist comments of my own dad about #WBA players - could never imagine the abuse and vitriol guys like these went through every day.  Great respect for a really nice bloke.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Red_All_Over_71 I see your personal coaching of Salah is paying off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy heck #ynwa #lfc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EskilCo does a lot of work in this space - #leadership #EmotionalIntelligence as well as #workplace and #teamwork #cohesiveness - they are master practitioners in #EI and run briefings on the business case for implementing a framework in the business  https://t.co/Jty0oLcUYP<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Time in #Munich connecting back to #UK after my latest #Bulgarian adventure - our little girl @TabithaLyra17 would be disappointed if I didn't play @VNV_Nation on the flight and in the airport - #RonanExpects<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@icopilots It's all because of your happy smiling demeanour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At this rate, it might be better for me to leave @bhx_official and go back into the airport, buy a ticket from Ryanair and claim compensation from @Lufthansa - anyone thinking that customers come first need to check their medication<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lufthansa Already on it and submitting my details.  Thank you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EskilCo @lufthansa It looks like between €400-500 based in the distance of the flight and the length of delay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EskilCo @lufthansa Not sure - maybe Lufthansa can tell me what the compensation is for a 7-hour flight delay with little guarantee of making my connection - who do I talk to, @lufthansa ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lufthansa finally gets round to admitting the delay to their flight... now I land at 18:22 in @Airport_FRA with a vain hope of getting the 18:50 to @SOFIAirport - to think, I picked @lufthansa instead of Ryanair!  https://t.co/td0vF6JJMQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lufthansa I'm guessing that, unless @lufthansa has mastered time travel and they indeed using a fleet of TARDIS' (is that the plural?) then their commitment to customer information has just gone down a wormhole  https://t.co/IOQzvunYab<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FlightClaimEU Nah, I can be annoyed about the level of service from @lufthansa on my own, thanks   Have a great day!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Isn't a government's #tax &amp; #budgets based upon #economic models?  Yet our #Brexit team feels that "economic models have all proven wrong."  Oh and wouldn't a #UKGOV Brexit impact assessment help with foundations for negotiation?   https://t.co/IAst0NYm7R<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbctms up since 2:30 courtesy of a grumpy toddler so figured... do some work, get TMS on, bite some nails - Warwick shrouded in a darkness almost as dark as the bags under my eyes!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>OK #LFC pace yerself - it's a long Christmas program without blowing all the goals in one go 😁 #YNWA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah cos this is how our #ukgov works - failing ministers warn failing prime ministers about their actions - #TeresaMay needs to get a grip, grow a pair or get out - and take her failing #Brexit negotiators with her  https://t.co/KrNYMWBePY<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Or maybe equip the #education system to train people better in the first place - the reason why #Hammond needs to retrain is because this #UKGov has woefully failed a generation (we also said this about the LAST generation)  https://t.co/UOqj2IpI4s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sigh.  #LFC arses - throwing 3 goals away is bad enough, but we had enough chances in the first half to have gone in FIVE up... but would that have been enough?! #YNWA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DreamscapeReiki away for night so time to work on #Norwegian #CSR assignment and prepare for #EQ certification next week - rock n roll...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jo_Optima @EskilCo it was all that #Croatian #Coffee and my bananas 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reflecting on 2016 the majority of my work has been in the areas of #corporate #strategy &amp; #culture - too busy doing it to notice it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Developing a #corporate &amp; #private #EmotionalIntelligence practice in #Warwickshire - definitely agree with this  https://t.co/igMcLSt3CB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After a horrible #Election2016 campaign, it's time for #reflection and taking a step back, taking a deep breath and thinking constructively  https://t.co/OCjdXJPKwx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To think... wit, style and articulation of the current #FLOTUS replaced by Melania Trump (which sounds like you need vagisil to clear it up)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It means "what's yours is America's and what's America's is America's"  https://t.co/ThXB5pUFjm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How drunk must America have been... and how long will their walk of shame be?  https://t.co/xmMxVpEhfw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One key thought over last few days is due to @zenelb - do I start #cryptocurrency college funds for my kids?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The good thing is at least isolationist xenophobes from #Brexit know which states to go to on their holidays  https://t.co/w4YhQmM3ZM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sat in departures in #Zagreb ready for @croatiaairlines to UK - a fantastic few days with #fintech people - and a cheeky beer!  https://t.co/gwGoSOglou<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>hey @EricStojko as you know, it's all down to the audience feedback - you need the interaction for it to really work! :)  https://t.co/BT4uKxZDv8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jo_Optima I'm sure we've all worked with a few puddings in our time...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jo_Optima This is what happens if you get word association wrong...  https://t.co/Txskj2eoBr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just to be clear - more people in the room believed in #unicorns than the moon landing 😊  https://t.co/LQp0GkyWfT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So when @Jo_Optima explained to us that #intrapreneurs are like cake... I figured I was more like a trifle - messy ingredients!  https://t.co/vaQZsMAXnU<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Red_All_Over_71 Yeah... about that...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Red_All_Over_71 certainly sorts out the GD when teams fold like this - even better if we see a clean sheet at the other end :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Red_All_Over_71 according to BBC... it could / should be 10-0 instead of just the mere 5-0...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Red_All_Over_71 All we need now is #SwanseaCity to stuff a few past #MUFC and the weekend can be considered a success<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Red_All_Over_71 Consistently impressive this season for #LFC - have to say that Mane has slotted in very well too<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_cynical_simon_ so your argument is it's ok for 3/4 of a billion pounds to be dull because I didn't go see them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_cynical_simon_ but when £700m of talent is on a pitch, I expect something better for my £50 ticket<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>"Are you 'thrifty' with your customer service?"  https://t.co/KU2eWx4ZdC by @spark_gb on @LinkedIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My latest article for @BusinessInGulf points out that if you do anything FOR anyone... then they are a customer  https://t.co/CqRCRoW3ZE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A week in 16th ARR. #Paris - I have some time free if any of my French network (e.g. @setolivier @Merkapt) fancies a coffee :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All ready for a week delivering #training in #Paris - won't be using any @thriftycars services while I'm there :) #customerservice #rubbish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When @thriftycars were advised that I didn't accept their decision... this is the email from #customerservice  https://t.co/WicuWGsf39<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Advised that Consumer Protection obliges @thriftycars to refund for non-delivery - poor #customerservice is more damaging, of course!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thriftycars no. Your replies are STILL delayed - let's not confuse people by suggesting my complaint has been resolved 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thriftycars numerous supporting emails from @jawbone, ongoing dialogue thru  #customerservice process, Jawbone in my hand this morning<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thriftycars Notified by Misbah Abid in #customerservices that info given by your own employee was overruled and no refund to be awarded<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Busy time at the Mac - article for @BusinessInGulf and for @Virgin whilst helping a new type of business consultancy with launch plans...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JawboneSupport no worries - am writing a blog about #customerservice and you guys are an exemplar of what the #customerexperience should be<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thriftycars hi Richard - I have already sent details and had an unsatisfactory response - what do you propose will be different this time?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@helloimedden @thriftycars more stories the better - I have interest from syndicated news services too 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_cynical_simon_ @Jawbone @thriftycars nice idea - maybe I'll run a poll on it across my social media streams 😀<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Great listening to the bells across #Warwick on a Sunday  https://t.co/MWotoso1IE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PSF1970 great to see that #Villa have improved from last season - possession in double figures!  https://t.co/yWVlwXurD9<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DCCbeta ah - we help organizations in this... the time between... people talk a lot in the meeting (promises, etc.) then nothing is done...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DCCbeta just think if you allocated a cost of €500 per hour per person attending that is then taken out of a dept's budget...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DCCbeta maybe if we allow people to take tasers into meetings... or have one chair randomly 'buzz' someone in the room ever 3-4 minutes...<|endoftext|>
