<|startoftext|>@Super70sSports That's a weird mix tape.  Seeing "Escape" on there means it was made at the earliest the end of 1979/beginning of 1980.

<|startoftext|>Since Eddie Murphy is trending becauss of "Party All The Time", this is the right time to tell all he had another top 40 hit in 1989, "Put Your Mouth On Me".  Recognize greatness.  #Eddiemurphy  https://t.co/IsLh49BW1q<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@zrastall17 I had Baylor to the 16, and WVU the F4  Hopefully KU will at least give you some Big XII love.  But Sparty... No words, man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zrastall17 same here.  So far, I've only lost five games.  Two of those teams, wvu and sparty, I had in the F4. With Sparty winning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Lakers win today over the Dubs, inches them closer to first place in the Pacific.  They now stand just 43.5 games back of GS.  #crazy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RTBowman22 @BleacherReport @Jonathan_Dry23 Absolutely awesome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best thing about the game?  Brent &amp; V, who have been pushed aside in recent years for "hipper" announcers, got to call one of the greatest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Actually, I go with my friends in the desert".  Why Brent Musburger is still one of the best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't know who is better:  Perry Ellis or his son Carlos Boozer?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching one of the all time classics in real time.  Turn on if you can #OUvsKU   https://t.co/npStHTNfGb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did IU make the fg? No idea.  But if refs could have reviewed the last play of the UM game, Duke isn't playing in  Pinstripe.  So I'm good.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Jeff Van Gundy just went all in on Dallas fans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Typical Clipps/Grizz game.  Gasol missed some clutch foul shots.  Now Dallas in Big D...that will be must see.  #Clippers<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DoGnamedRAIDER @LAClippers @SacramentoKings Absolutely.  I'm glad we played yall twice early, 'cause y'all gonna just keep getting better<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you @LAClippers  for allowing me some peace tonight.  Great win.  Beating @SacramentoKings twice in a week is never easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, good game.  Now if you will excuse me, Ima put my salt shaker costume on.  #duke<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@zrastall17 Even more amazing is Ga Tech's drop off this year.  I thought they could possibly slide into the playoffs.  Whoops.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zrastall17 Tech, the U should be leading the way with the other five trying to make noise...not vice versa.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zrastall17 Cutcliffe has done wonders for Duke, and IMO, there is no excuse for Tech not to beat them every year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zrastall17 When Duke, carolina, and now maybe Pitt passes you in that division, you need a change.  This applies to the U as well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zrastall17 Agree.  Tech is too good of a program to have wheels fall off.  People are chomping at the bit for him to be gone in Bburg.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BlahBethany LOL...I know.  I hate myself for loving it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlahBethany  I get she is always #4, but anywhere else she probably is #5.  1 in 4 odds better than 1 in 5. (Assuming Beck/Jackie in game)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlahBethany Solid point.  I would love to see it.  Why no one has gone after the obvious three headed elephant in the house is baffling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlahBethany I do like the idea though.  She just needs security to get away from Austwins.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlahBethany Could work, problem I see:  Becky/Jackie walk in, V odd person out. of that. Shell walks in, Shell odd one out with V/Austwins<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlahBethany @bigbrothernet I get that, but at this point who does she go with?  Options limited.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigbrothernet @BlahBethany How does it not make sense?  They came clean, V needs them. Win/win for all four.S/JM expendable to Austwins/V<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I want to thank my new favorite non-Clipper, Matthew Dellavedova, for making my night.  First two games are why NBA &gt; college.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They should've put the fight on cable and game seven of the Spurs/Clipps on PPV #MayPac<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best NBA game I've seen since 88.  Possibly best series I've ever seen.  My team lost that day.  Not tonight...amazing game, amazing series<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@zrastall17 Congrats man!  Can't wait 'til Monday.  If we lose, I'm glad it can be to you!  Let's do this!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was watching the game on the "Duke Stream" until I realized that the regular CBS announcers are more Pro-Duke than the Duke ones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonathan_Dry23 whatcha gonna do, brother?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonathan_Dry23 heck yeah.  Scott @SCOTTHALLNWO my favorite wrestler ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonathan_Dry23 Sledgehammer does it every time lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonathan_Dry23 No reason for HHH beating Sting.  Other than that, I loved all the matches.  Especially ladder and Taker matches<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonathan_Dry23 haha I can't stand Rollins.   Reigns looked good, Lesnar didn't get pinned, Rollins gets to hold the strap.  Win all around<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonathan_Dry23 Good stuff.  Reigns/Lesnar was straight up legit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonathan_Dry23 you watch wrestlemania?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@zrastall17 Oh absolutely.  I'm already popping popcorn for it.  And who even knows who will be in the second game, lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zrastall17 Obviously a long way to go, but if you end season beating U o A, UK, &amp; Duke, it would be one of the greatest walk offs.  Ever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zrastall17 hadn't had a chance to say it yet, but congrats!  Hope to see you in two/three games.  #OnWisconsin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All year ND won by playing as a team.  The last two minutes they decide to go iso?  Karl Anthony-Towns is a man amongst boys.  Congrat Cats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonathan_Dry23 one of the best I've ever seen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When cops are guarding the refs looking at a replay...you know it is an amazing, all time game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow.  Izzo has beaten a higher seed 12 times.  I don't think Roy has done it once at unc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gatorade/Powerade with dueling injured NBA player commercials.  Advantage:  Rose in Concrete<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That roar you just heard came from Vegas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nantz, Hill, and Raftery treating this game like it is a 40 point blow out.  Stories about nothing to do with the game.  Disappointing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Notre Dame is going to be "America's Team" tomorrow, Mike Brey?  Cool story, bro.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe Daxter Miles was just predicting the halftime score when he said 36-1.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reggie Miller surprised Roy hasn't called a TO?  He obviously has missed every game Roy has ever coached.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awesome gesture by Dean Smith.  But someone needs to pull my favorite unc player's address off the pic.  #dante<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biggest upset of the night brewing  RT:  @Lakers  30s30 seconds ago Lakers with the lead at the half.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You want madness? The difference between the ACC being 0-3 v. 3-0 on day one is eight points.  That's what March Madness is all about #acc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>John Adams now answering questions about the SMU call.  I haven't seen him this nervous since the XYZ affair. #johnmarshall #larrybrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An observation:  in 1990, LMU scored 149 points in a tournament game v. Mich.  So far, one game has that many points by both teams combined<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bryce Alford is legit.  I remember when Bobby Knight recruited him in 8th grade.  Or something like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So...........the Big 12 is 0-3, and UCLA wins with an "us against the world" mentality.  And the tourney is five hours old?  #marchmadness<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@McMcGingy Big win for State...and of course the world was focused on "catch".  I was watching, so was Captain, lol #gopack #GoDuke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I take that back, one good team playing a great game right now...@ATLHawks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a shame most focus on NFL...two good teams, @ATLHawks and @WashWizards , playing a great game right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Brad_Gaither I missed most of it.  Seems State was on fire, Duke couldn't catch up.  Big win...proud of your boys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's being lost in the "uncatch" is Cowboys risking it all on 4 and 2, with one TO.  Tough call, but safer play might switch outcome #NFL<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The Ravens did win a super bowl before, right?  They playing like they've never been there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was one of the worst throws I've seen in a clutch situation.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChrisTurner19 just awful.  And he will be on the super bowl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did Collinsworth actually groan when the ball went out of bounds on the fumble?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@zrastall17 Sry Wednesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zrastall17 you at the game Tuesday?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nastic tough miss.  Could've cut it to 10.  Quinn comes down and drops a 3.  Devils up 15.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ton on new talent...but Justise Winslow really looks like the real deal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Clips miss, call TO they do not have.  Seems like the perfect ending to the game.  4-3, with five of those games at home...not good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Manu misses 2 FT..Clipps down 2 with ball :10 left<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mariomachi before I forget...I want to see Duke play in '16 in Pittsburgh.  If you want to make plans 2 years out, I'd love to go, lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mariomachi They will be back.  And thanks!  How's fatherhood?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mariomachi my second favorite team in ACC...they are losing games like Duke used to...but they have the talent to bounce back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mariomachi Agree  on Conner and Blewitt both.  I've never seen Blewitt miss ever until the last one.  More on coaching.  Hate it 4 Pitt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mariomachi I will agree that it's not totally on the kicker.  He's been nails all season, came back to hit a clutch FG in OT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>lol...I say one pun on the kicker's name and you make it like I've been on here for hours doing it.  Good hearing from you, as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never thought #DUKEvsPITT would be trending 3rd in USA.  Not good when the Pitt kicker is second.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Kudos to ESPN showing all of LBJ presser but cutting out of Duncan's.  And by "Kudos" I mean, "Typical".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heat are favorites to win the chip next year at 5/2 odds.  After next year the 5/2 will stand for "LBJ in finals/chips won"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hoping Mark Jackson gets a coaching job soon!  Because I can't take a whole year calling games.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SportsCenter How about making this about Tim Duncan (5-1) and the Spurs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've watched Duncan interviews since 1994.  Most candid ever.  I didn't like the sound of that...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tim Duncan deserves to be in convo for "Mt. Rushmore" of NBA.  One Ray Allen shot from 6 chips. Not the best player for this one, but still<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonathan_Dry23 I've tried to tell everyone, lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonathan_Dry23 He could reup.  But Wade is broken<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonathan_Dry23 lol possibly.  I think maybe Chicago.  You'll never cheer for the Bulls again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I'm LBJ , I'm telling Spole to put me in right now.  If I'm his PR guy, I'm literally running down there right now and putting him in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow.  I can't believe the "Big 3" are not playing this out.  Remember the Alamo!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonathan_Dry23 Possibly...but it would be a drop in talent.  Love and him aren't going anywhere.  Love hasn't even been to a playoff game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonathan_Dry23 He's not going there.  And lose to the Spurs, Clippers, and Thunder more than twice a season?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LexLexElder You know I always come to you for my NBA news!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Way too early prediction:  Pop and Duncan come back next year, Spurs are huge favorites to repeat.  No matter who ends up where.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonathan_Dry23 Si<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I just heard Manu and Tim say to each other, "not three, not four..."<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Waiting for Drake to say he is a fan of Holland and also The Netherlands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a new button on my tv that shows you what an NBA final game looks like as a soccer game. #NetherlandsVsSpain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I'll take my FIFA World Cup game off of "amateur" now.  Beating Spain this bad is getting boring.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@zrastall17 You better believe it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you know where you were the last time Spain and Dutch met in WC?  I was going to see Boz Scaggs.  Not in '78...2010.  #hipster<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Dutch were my team in '10, and they are my boys in '14 as well. @OfficialARobben = amazing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still one game left, but if they win in 5, the  '14 @spurs are the most dominant team since '96 Bulls.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Leonard clowning Wade.  I.  Love.  It.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How old is Duncan?  When he got a wizard tattoo I thought to myself, "A Wizard?  That would be a good nickname 4 an NBA team"!  #bullets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just throwing it out there...Tim Duncan is one game, and one Ray Allen miracle, from having 6 chips.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just think how different this game would be with Melo playing with the Heat.  The Spurs would be up, like, 30.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any way possible to get one of the ABC affiliated channels to just show Heat fans leaving?  #heatfansince2011<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Thinking about it all night and day, I got what we can say now:  it was a strike short season #asterick4lbj @RTBowman22 @Jonathan_Dry23<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why the 2-3-2 format is not fair.  The Finals might not even return to OKC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WSRooney @okcthunder I'm feeling the Heat in 6.  I trust LBJ more to not collapse than I do Westbrook.  Hope you are right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willisb_rad I know...it sounds idiotic but I've always kinda felt like you do  about his shot and his game.  Yet, as you said, it goes in!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willisb_rad Never been a big fan of Wade's game (which is weird).  I'm totally with ya on the Heat trading him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willisb_rad rondo had it right about Wade crying.  He did throughout the series...no idea what his deal is, but he needs to fix it fast!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willisb_rad Yup...could u imagine having Davis with LBJ, plus an extra 10-12 mil to play with?  Or Howard playing with LBJ...win/win 4 all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willisb_rad @Jonathan_Dry23 @RTBowman22 Even better...trade Wade 2 NO for the 1st pick rights.  That would be nasty...crazy salary space<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willisb_rad @Jonathan_Dry23 @RTBowman22 Trade Wade 4 Howard straight up...Heat true superpower.  Magic get their superstar.  Crazy rivalry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willisb_rad @Jonathan_Dry23 @RTBowman22  hard to see okc not winning multiple titles if they win this year...maybe lakers/celtics 2.0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willisb_rad @Jonathan_Dry23 @RTBowman22 I remember when lbj &amp; bosh went you were big on 'em...their window obviously isn't close 2 closing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willisb_rad @Jonathan_Dry23 @RTBowman22 I'm leaning toward heat ... LBJ has taken this team on his back...can't wait either!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RTBowman22 @jonathan_dry23 lol...that would be funny.  I don't see that happening, but that would be amazing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WoolEBull @Jonathan_Dry23 @willisb_rad @rtbowman22 I'm not sure yet who I have...it comes down to who I trust less, Westbrook or LBJ.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonathan_Dry23 @willisb_rad @rtbowman22 Can LeBron pass the scepter to Durant if he has never won anything?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finals can't get here fast enough...who ya got?  @Jonathan_Dry23 @willisb_rad @RTBowman22<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@heyitsguin It was great to see you :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willisb_rad Yeah.  Def. hitting a sox game.  Plus Duke in final 4 of LAX and it is being played at Gillete Stadium...good time for sports!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RTBowman22 fact<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@willisb_rad He's definitely better player than he is a dancer.  Timmy playin like it's 1999.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bomani_jones nah...they have the Spurs right where they want them...down 17 in the 3rd...oh, this ain't Memphis is it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>btw...not pulling 4 Spurs is fun!  Obviously not a big Green fan.  Can't stand seeing Diaw gravy train. @willisb_rad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willisb_rad Timmy, Randolph, Rusty...I'd take it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willisb_rad at this point, bring in Lamar Odom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willisb_rad I'd try to make #bringbackdaveodom to trend, but I don't think it would work!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willisb_rad lol!  Always hated unc.  Cried when Gtown lost to em in '82.  I pulled 4 Wake til I went 2 Duke...still WF fan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willisb_rad Yeah.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wilcollins10 Clips, lakers, and Kings all have to play playoff games at Staples this weekend.  #crowdedhouse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In your layer of disdain for the other three tobacco road teams, how do they rate?@willisb_rad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Clipps playing well for one quarter...let's see how long this will last.  Deandre actually showing up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Since 1993, there has never been a game where I have rooted against Tim Duncan.  That changes tonight.  #clippernation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willisb_rad I know, right?  Love to see the City of Angels showdown...alas, think Spurs in 5, Thunder in 6?  Hope I'm wrong...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DryMan3 @Jonathan_Dry23 No greater words have ever been spoken by you.  Making it one of my fav. quotes on Facebook.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willisb_rad When we got CP3, I said fire VDN.  End of the season:  fire VDM.  After game 6:  fired VDN.  Today:  Lifetime Contract!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willisb_rad Can't wait to see the Staples Center sched.  w/ Kings, Lakers, and Clips all playing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willisb_rad not gonna lie.  did not see this coming.  Fan since 1992...greatest nba day of my life #clippernation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never thought I would live to see the Clippers do what they did today.  Gut check at its finest.  Bye bye Griz, Hola Spurs.  #clippernation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ddoyle3429 It's better because the world can't see it, plus all of the world isn't on here!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willisb_rad Yup.  They can't stand each other...solid academics + rabid FCS fans.  If there is an opening, those two would be a good tandem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willisb_rad a package deal to the MAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willisb_rad ASU doesn't have seating req. yet (the hill doesn't count).  JMU is now up to the right #.  Heard those two could be<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willisb_rad Awful.  Just awful.  And I think LU might have to wait in line for, oh I don't know, maybe ASU, JMU, Delaware, Richmond, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willisb_rad sixers-bulls has been awful.  fwi, because this would intrigue you, Liberty just announced they are moving up to FCS...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willisb_rad Have won twice...people say it's been an ugly series, but I've liked it.  Reggie Evans is my hero.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willisb_rad The best.  Clips have any shot tomorrow?  Me thinks not.  If only DeAndre could step up maybe could stem the tide of injury.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willisb_rad I was so annoying @ JMU being a DD fan.  Best moment EVER:   http://t.co/HWdviVpD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willisb_rad I was diehard Wake fan until even after I went 2 Duke.  Was at @r22childress last home game.  Never pulled against Timmy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In honor of my Clippers coming from ahead tonight, I'm watching Semi-Pro #jackiemoon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've never pulled against Timmy D in my life, and it looks like I won't have to now #goodthingsaboutclipperslosing@willisb_rad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How very Clipper of Randy Foye to step out of bounds like that.  See you back in Tennessee.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jonathan_Dry23 i can't stand the knicks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealSkipBayless You were banging the drum earlier in the season for CP3 as MVP... I think what he is doing for Clips is MVP caliber #LACP3<|endoftext|>
