<|startoftext|>In general, a fair bit of thought should be put into picking a fight with a powerful bully.  Sometimes it just doesn’t make sense to do so (no use copping a beating for nothing, and all that). Sometimes, even though it’s probably going to hurt, it’s necessary to do so.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tanyariches To be clear, I think the ‘Jesus is my boyfriend’ language is problematic, arising out of a distrust of all emotion, a weird view of masculinity, and a desire for ‘objective’ doctrine.

<|startoftext|>@Peter_Fitz It's a very common thought, but mostly in the reverse: 'Don't do to others as you wouldn't have them do to you.'

<|startoftext|>@ejlawann Sounds like you’re more interested in partisan politics than truth. Good for you, but I don’t need to stick around for it.  Good day, sir.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ejlawann Yeah, I support AOC; she’s excellent!  I’m not going to debate abortion policy with you, but if you want to see abortion rates actually decrease then follow the data (hint: the hardline conservative political rhetoric does nothing to reduce numbers)  https://t.co/kcBD8BAEc4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ejlawann @bodonogh76 Us Christians haven’t been treated unequally. This has nothing to do with Christians. Stop trying to make something of nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ejlawann There’s that persecution complex.  I’m not defending the decision; I don’t think it’s a very good one. It just doesn’t have anything to do with being unfair (deliberately or otherwise) towards Christians.  Meet with people from your church (as you’re able to do); stop whinging.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ejlawann It’s for one weekend. You can meet with your fellow Christians every Sunday, if you follow the guidelines. It’s not that big a deal. (Again, I don’t think *any* group of 500 people indoors is a great idea, but let’s stop blowing this out of all proportion.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bodonogh76 @ejlawann I’ve already said I don’t think it’s a great decision, but the ‘second class citizens’ line is nonsense. What’s so hard to understand about that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ejlawann Simply not true. You *can* meet with up to 99 others (subject to the 4m2 rule), with other COVID safety plan measures in place. I know the details of it because I oversee it for my church. This case is a one-off exemption for a sacred celebration, that then goes back to normal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LesBian92251216  https://t.co/RztcTLBZPO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ejlawann My church has followed the rules, with a mix of online streaming and limited numbers on site (according to social distancing guidelines).  We’re not being oppressed. Get some perspective.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Lennysonofbenny @ejlawann @nyunggai @BradHazzard @GladysB People attending Friday had to wear masks, had temp. checks, and abided by social distancing. Seems like reasonable steps taken (not much different to going to the footy).  The questions are fine; Warren’s post was well and truly over the top.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LesBian92251216 @nyunggai @BradHazzard @GladysB Good grief.  By all means critique the decision, but please don’t try to turn this into some conflict between Christians and Muslims.  You’re trying to spark up something that’s just not there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lennysonofbenny @ejlawann @nyunggai @BradHazzard @GladysB I don’t think the mosque decision is a particularly good one, though I recognise the situation now is slightly different to the unknown panic at Easter time. I do wish my Muslim friends all the best for their sacred holiday, and pray they (and all of us) are careful at this time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LesBian92251216 @nyunggai @BradHazzard @GladysB I’m responding to his (ridiculous) claim that we Christians are being treated like ‘second class citizens’. We’re not.  Critique the decision with something other than hyperbole.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ejlawann @nyunggai @BradHazzard @GladysB He’s making it sound like Christians are being treated poorly. I’m a Christian pastor; what he’s saying is absolutely untrue.  Critique the decision, don’t resort to hyperbole.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@openthebooksaus @nyunggai @BradHazzard @GladysB Warren claimed that Christians in NSW are now ‘second class citizens.’ I’m a Christian pastor, and I’m telling you that his claim is absolutely ridiculous.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>1) A constitutionally-enshrined Indiginous Voice to parliament; 2) A process for agreement-making (Treaty/Treaties); 3) A process for genuine Truth-telling.  It’s not just a good way to begin to ease tensions (though I think it might do that); it’s the right thing to do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I share concerns re: large groups gathering during a pandemic, but it seems to me that there is a very simple way to show goodwill and perhaps diffuse the need for such protests: Immediately commit to implementing in full the calls outlined in the Uluru Statement from the heart:<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>3. There’a a need for deep repentance and transformation at a structural level.

<|startoftext|>I will wait and see (and obviously keep my distance from others in the meantime), until I can be confident of the points noted above.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am choosing to continue strict quarantine measures as part of my decision to not (yet) download the app. I have only been in close proximity (for more than 15 minutes) with one person who is not my immediate family in the past 3 weeks, and I am noting any such interactions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3) I’m waiting for the legislation to be passed concerning the use of the data the app collects. Our Government does not have a good track record regarding technology/data/privacy. This is clear and verifiable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2) I am waiting for the app’s code to be released and examined by experts. This should have been done before the app was released.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1) There seem to be some difficulties with it on Apple devices (ie. it doesn’t seem to ‘work in the background’ on Apple phones). I’ll be interested to see the work that Apple is doing for their devices, and how it might either complement (or supersede) this app.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For what it’s worth, I’m not convinced that it’s helpful to imply that such people either don’t care about other people or are wacky conspiracy theorists.  I remain quite open to the app, but there are a few reasons I haven’t yet downloaded it:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are a number of people posting about the #COVIDSafe app in ways that seem to be seeking to shame those who haven’t (yet) downloaded it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaelfrost6 And rightly so. What a cute kid!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sallyrugg My mum used to play this song when I was a kid, and it helped form my fierce opposition to war from a young age. (My memories of Anzac Day as a kid are of these kinds of solemn reflections and truth-telling about war; a far cry from what we now often see.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There’s going to be a strong temptation to ‘get back to normal’ as the restrictions are eased. Wouldn’t it be great if the new normal included wider and deeper connection with each other!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Connecting around growing food also leads naturally to sharing meals together (using what you’ve grown) once the physical distancing regulations are relaxed. Start talking now about such possibilities, as well as things like street parties.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(If you live in an apartment and have limited space, perhaps you could each grow one or two things on your balcony and then share with each other so everyone gets a bit of everything!)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Building from there, what are some steps you can take to build-in ongoing connection? Many people are choosing to install veggie gardens and the like. Could you set up a kind of co-op in your street to be sharing what you grow together?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you already have a connection, what are some fun, simple things you can do together (while keeping to physical distance regulations)? Perhaps an isolation dance party ‘for the kids’ at the end of your driveways? (The grown-ups love that stuff too but find it harder to say so).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’d love to see these moves last — indeed continue to grow — beyond the isolation measures.  Do you know your neighbours? If not, it’s pretty simple to use this opportunity to introduce yourself. (It’s not too late to do a letterbox drop with a brief intro &amp; offer of help.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Neighbours are reaching out to each with often small yet beautiful offers of help, establishing and strengthening the web of connections that are necessary for healthy communities (some might call it the ‘soul’ of the community).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Covid-19 has brought with it a (long overdue) renewed focus on neighbourliness, with many people starting to engage with their neighbours again (or perhaps for the first time).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t mean to alarm anyone, but those bike-riding food delivery dudes have legit taken over the roads. (I don’t think they’re going to let us have them back without a fight.)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@johnpauldickson @karlfaase @KateZMedia To substantiate the claim that it’s insulting, you’d need to prove that it’s untrue. To prove that it’s untrue you’d need to look over all your interactions on these matters.  I’m confident of the statement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnpauldickson @karlfaase @KateZMedia Your consistent centering of (modern) Australia around white Christianity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnpauldickson @karlfaase @KateZMedia I can’t find anything ‘outrageous,’ John. You’ll have to help me in identifying it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnpauldickson @karlfaase @KateZMedia Which comment? That Karl’s response was predictable?  It was. That’s simply a statement of experience.  I’d love to hear how that’s ‘outrageous.’<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnpauldickson You don’t have to listen to me; I’m not asking you to do that. You really should listen deeply to the voices of Aboriginal people, and let it shape you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnpauldickson You are now continuing with it, just adding ‘Modern’ in brackets. You then refuse to acknowledge that some might encounter this in a way you don’t intend, but put the onus on those people to research you to find out your position on these matters.  All of it revolves around you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnpauldickson Instead of grappling with that possibility, you dismissed it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnpauldickson Earlier in January, you posted information on your FB page outlining a series of talks you were giving, culminating in one titled ‘The message that launched Australia.’ In a now deleted thread, it was explained to you that this was rather inconsiderately phrased.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnpauldickson @karlfaase @KateZMedia Haha! The fact that you’re happy to ignore Karl’s jab at my ‘jaundiced position’ and to focus on my response is a perfect illustration of how you operate in these situations, John.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnpauldickson John, it’s been explained to you a number of times — most recently on a now-deleted FB thread. My call is simple: allow yourself to be guided by the voices of Aboriginal people on these matters, rather than trying to set the parameters yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@karlfaase @johnpauldickson @KateZMedia I’m more than happy to have a ‘consistency’ grounded in calling those of us with social and religious power to listen to those whose voices are either ignored or deliberately silenced.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@karlfaase @johnpauldickson @KateZMedia Well, that was perfectly predictable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnpauldickson It’s certainly possible that I am guilty of that which you suggest.  It’s also possible that you haven’t been listening deeply enough to the criticism as it has previously been articulated for you. Intellectual humility suggests that you should be open to that possibility.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnpauldickson My hope and prayer is that, sooner rather than later, you would recognise the ‘strong argument’ that’s already been presented to you. You don’t have to take my word for it, but please listen to, and be open to the guidance (and correction) of, Aboriginal people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnpauldickson John, that this is a reasonably careless choice of words has been brought to your attention already. What would it take in order for you to choose alternate phrasing?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It’s quite simple: ‘creation care’ is an act of discipleship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The biblical story (especially in the Hebrew prophets) is also strong in its condemnation of greed and human power that exploits for its own gain (which is essentially the business model of the fossil fuel industry, and the politicians who support it).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why we pray “Your kingdom come on earth as it (already) is in heaven.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The goal of the biblical story is not the discarding of God’s good creation but rather it’s redemption (or, better, resurrection). Biblical hope is not disembodied, but is instead thoroughly grounded (pun intended) in creation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This care of God’s good creation is an act of worship — not worship *of* creation but rather an act of assisting all of creation, humans included, to worship the Creator through its very life and flourishing and enjoyment of this good and beautiful world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The biblical story (from the very first chapter) establishes that God is the creator of all things, that this creation is ‘good’ (that ‘matter’ matters), and that humans are entrusted with its care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To my mind, Christians should be leading the way in taking care of the environment.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>As such, we do need to work towards efforts that build resilience and that help us adapt to changing conditions.  But what this (conveniently) ignores is that we’ve had the opportunity to act for decades but have systematically failed to do so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The line being put forward seems to be that, even if we cut all carbon emissions today, this fire season and the next won’t be affected.  That’s true, and it is true (from what I understand) that certain serious changes in global climate conditions are already ‘locked in.’<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There seems to be a shift in messaging around climate change from the Government towards ‘resilience’ and ‘adaptation.’  As such, we seem to have leapfrogged any notion of ‘mitigation.’<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcusCVance My last name used to be ‘Dowton,’ but then Downton Abbey came out and I’ve given up correcting people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joe_Hildebrand Historical reality is a little more complex.  The Greens refused to pass inadequate policy. The far right rolled Turnbull. The Greens worked with Gillard to pass better policy. The far right overturned good policy when they came to power with Abbott.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>However, that desire can easily fall into a faux balance (or a kind of ‘thin’ centrism) which plots its course simply by navigating between whatever political flags are erected, regardless of where such flags are placed or who is placing them.  That’s not so wise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think the desire for ‘balance’ is a good thing. ‘Swimming between the flags’ is often wise.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JediKeri @GospelPanacea No one said anything about sitting back. Pacifism is not 'passivism'. Active nonviolence is an incredibly powerful force.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JediKeri @GospelPanacea You can disagree if you like, but the evidence in the book of Revelation goes against your position.  As the old saying goes, when Jesus disarmed Peter in the garden he disarmed all Christians.  You can argue for the use of violence, but you just can't use Jesus to do so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JediKeri @GospelPanacea Nope.  The author of Revelation uses all the warrior-messiah language, but completely subverts the meaning.  It’s not the Lion and the Lamb, but rather the (expected) Lion *is* the Lamb. The nationalistic, militaristic expectation is thoroughly overturned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JediKeri @GospelPanacea In Revelation, the sword comes out of Jesus’ mouth. (Hint: it is his testimony as the faithful witness.)  It’s not a literal sword, and he doesn’t go all Braveheart. This is not the proof of your position that you think it is.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RobDon29550757 @FatherBob It’s a family; the parents are mucking around with their own kid, obviously in jest.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RobDon29550757 @FatherBob Her foot is on the person’s hip/stomach.  If you’re really concerned, I reckon I can find the name of the person (through contacts) and ask them how they felt. I’m very confident it was experienced as playful.

<|startoftext|>Will there ever be another Labor leader who can take the public with them on an alternate vision that doesn’t remain centred on (or self-referential to) a neoliberal ideology?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Australia’s east coast is currently burning out of control due to fires that are undoubtedly enhanced by climate change, and the PM is missing in action, and yet the Labor Party seems incapable of presenting a clear, compelling challenge to the status quo. Why is that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That means we need to go all the way back to Gough to find a genuinely Labor platform that was also compelling. That’s before my lifetime.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hawke and Keating certainly presented a compelling vision, but it’s hard not to see their time as a centering of neoliberalism (even though it came with something of a conscience with social safety nets).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kevin Rudd was essentially elected on a ‘Liberal Lite’ platform. There was a bit of genuine Labor policy along the way for him too, but it never quite got there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Julia Gillard didn’t ever seem to work out how to present the message, though did get a bit of genuine Labor policy through. I admire her, but it’s hard to call her presentation ‘compelling’ and there were certainly capitulations to Coalition policy as ‘central’ along the way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To his credit, Bill Shorten presented a genuinely Labor platform at the last election, but he seemed incapable of making it compelling. He also simply wasn’t trusted, due to his role in bringing down multiple sitting PMs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anthony Albanese has accepted the notion that Labor can’t take the Government head-on in regards to fossil fuel policy and is now trying, painfully, to straddle an unstraddleable fence. He also seems to suggest that the platform Labor took to the last election was all a bit much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve been wondering (quite a lot) lately whether we’ll ever see another Australian Labor Party leader present a compelling vision of a genuine Labor policy platform on its own terms (as opposed to being in constant reference to Coalition policy as a given).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse @BrianCHouston I find this really troubling, Pastor Brian. Can you imagine if John the Revelator had said, “When Rome is strong, the world is a better place’?  Please don’t write this off as ‘Hillsong bashing.’ That’s not my jam. I’m just deeply, deeply concerned at your statement here.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I’ve been trying to work out how to process my disappointment in @JacquiLambie for her role in repealing the #Medevac legislation today.  I need to remind myself, though, that she’s only in that position because of a soulless government committed to cruelty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #Medevac legislation was working. Desperate people were getting the basic help they needed; we were no less safe.  But an unrelenting commitment to breaking these vulnerable people trumped everything else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joelhollier I’m so sorry, mate.  Maybe try denying the trinity and being a jerk to vulnerable, tired people on social media. Apparently you’ll be welcomed with open arms and feircely defended...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Well, here we go: ‘Severe,’ ‘extreme,’ and even ‘catastrophic’ fire conditions across large parts of NSW and into QLD today.  Stay safe, people.  Lord, have mercy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And when they fail to act, we need to remind them of the importance and the urgency.  I’ll continue to pray as I do just that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But we also need action. We need our elected representatives to make better decisions about resourcing fire services. We need them to face up to the reality of more, and more serious, extreme weather events, and to make policy decisions accordingly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s been said before, but it’s worth saying again: ‘Thoughts and prayers’ are simply not enough.  Don’t get me wrong: I am praying for the current fire situation in NSW, and will certainly be praying for tomorrow’s ‘catastrophic’ fire conditions (and beyond).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bairdjulia It’s on so many fronts.

<|startoftext|>As part of the discussions about DFV over the past few years, there are inevitably three ‘necessary conversations’ that are identified:  1) Power (and patriarchy); 2) Consent; 3) Female pleasure.

<|startoftext|>@damonayoung Part of the muddling of the categories is in the conflation of forgiveness with reconciliation.  I can’t do Volf’s work justice in tweets, but I do recommend engaging with ‘Exclusion &amp; Embrace.’ It’s an extraordinary book!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@damonayoung This is a really good point. Ellen et al are not in a position to do the forgiving of people like GWB. Their passing over of the offence(s) is potentially adding to the offence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@damonayoung It’s still a political act in that it takes the power away from the perpetrator and locates it in the agency of the one doing the forgiving.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s why I don’t just need to pay deep attention to the voices of people of colour; I need to help create space where those voices can more easily be heard.  Part of this entails getting out of the way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the things I’m becoming more aware of is that my wokeness can never fully override my whiteness.  My whiteness is engrained in me to the deepest levels.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@damonayoung Forgiveness can come before there is full recognition or repentance, because it’s more about the offended person/victim releasing themselves from the cage created by the perpetrator.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@damonayoung Full reconciliation must include truth and justice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@damonayoung Forgiveness releases the offended person (or victim) from the prison created by the offender. This opens the door for genuine repentance from the offender, reparation (as far as is possible), and only then the possibility of reconciliation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@damonayoung Theologian Miroslav Volf’s excellent ‘Exclusion &amp; Embrace’ is a must read on forgiveness. Volf essentially argues that forgiveness should not be equated with reconciliation (‘embrace’).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Talk with other dads about signs of domestic and family violence, and hold each other accountable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have blokes’ get-togethers where everyone can bring their kids.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If a dad can’t make a work meeting because he needs to be at his kid’s event/award ceremony/play/whatever, give him a fist bump and reschedule the meeting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t fall for the trap of seeing everyone else’s kids in competition with yours. Build up each other’s kids and celebrate their achievements.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If a dad is boasting about how he doesn’t change nappies or get up in the night to his kids, firmly but politely call it out and remind him that this stuff is part and parcel of being a dad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If another dad is looking after his own kids, don’t ever refer to it as babysitting. It’s called being a parent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If another dad can’t come out and play because he wants to spend time with his family, don’t ever put pressure on him. Acknowledge his choice as a win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If another dad is clowning around with his kids (eg. playing ‘the floor is lava’ or wrestling with them or having a tea party), don’t make him feel stupid for it. Encourage him with a nod and a knowing smile.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m not really sure why, but I’ve been reflecting a bit today about being a dad and how dads can encourage each other. Random, I know.  Anyway, here’s a few (incomplete) thoughts on ‘the dad code’ (or ‘the dad rules’):<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it’s only fair that we all be allowed to throw eggs at anyone who suggests Australia adopt U.S.-style policies around health care, education, or guns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Once again we’re faced with the need for deep theological reflection on forgiveness, repentance and reconciliation in order to cut through the misconceptions &amp; misinformation.  Miroslav Volf’s ‘Exclusion &amp; Embrace’ is the most helpful book I’ve ever encountered on these matters.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>...for the sake of those who aren’t yet able to make those decisions (but will live with the consequences of current inaction) and for future generations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2) Greta Thunberg is not asking to be received as the ultimate authority on climate science. She is able to summarise the basics remarkably well, but her plea is for adults — especially those in positions of power — to *be* adults and to act on the evidence available to us...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1) A 16 is not an adult, but neither are they a child. 16 year olds have, in general, the capacity for reasoned thought and the ability to understand complexity. They have, in general, significant agency in terms of decisions about their lives.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We do have a problem here, and it’s making us sick. It’s not your (or my) fault. But we are going to have to work together to find our elusive wellbeing.  (Again, if this raises anything for you and you need to talk with someone, please do call Lifeline on 13 11 14.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What if these are the perfectly natural consequences of the system within which we live and breathe — which then has the audacity to pull a Jedi mind-trick on us by convincing us that ‘the problem’ is located wholly within?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What if the overarching framework of neoliberalism leads, inevitably, to ever increasing rates of anxiety and depression?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Though we do often note that individuals are not alone, there is nevertheless often an assumption that these challenges are located within the individual (even if sometimes triggered or worsened by external circumstances).  But what if the water we swim in is poisonous?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Over the past few years I’ve come to see more clearly that part of the challenge in discussing these matters is the almost constant tendency to privatise and internalise our experiences.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s good and right that we talk about these things, and it’s encouraging to see so many people opening up about their experiences of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation.

<|startoftext|>@arrowleaders Some of these very same people are actively seeking to have churches/ministers of religion/theology lecturers formally excluded if they don't fully hold to the same conservative line (eg. if those people say lgbtqia+ kids aren't going to go to hell).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arrowleaders Some Christians are fighting hard for the 'religious freedom' to say what they want — even if it's perceived by others to be harmful.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@johnpauldickson @Peter_Fitz I guess I could, but at this point it kind of looks like you’re using the mental health of young lgbtqia+ people to play a game of ‘gotcha’ with Fitz.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnpauldickson @Peter_Fitz It also, if you’re not careful, almost sounds like you’re suggesting that, if young lgbtqia+ people can just have more ‘robust’ mental health then it’s all good (ignoring why those outcomes are so bad in the first place).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnpauldickson @Peter_Fitz Does it, though?  For one, it’s a hypothetical removed from reality (religious-based internalised homonegativity is actually killing lgbtqia+ kids).

<|startoftext|>It’s clearly a masterpiece of the genre.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There was initially a post credits scene showing Johnny Castle returning to 1987 satisfied with his efforts, but it was decided that this would be too obvious and that it would best to leave subtle clues for the discerning viewer to put together.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Having orchestrated the events perfectly, Castle decides to crash the end-of-season talent show to drive the point home — and brings a song from his own time, 1987, to help make the moment one that no one would forget.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The focal point around Penny’s pregnancy and subsequent abortion was shocking for 1963, but becomes a defining symbol of the lack of consequences for the privileged (eg. Robbie’s decision not to help Penny). Castle is also aware that Roe v Wade was just a decade away (in 1973).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Castle chooses Kellerman’s resort as a hotbed of upper-class snootiness in order to showcase the hypocrisy of the wealthy and to begin to unpick the suffocating blanket of structural inequality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Johnny Castle is not just a dance teacher — he’s a time traveller determined to overturn the blatant classism of 1960s America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think about it: the Houseman’s vacation occurs in the summer of 1963, which is all well and good until you realise that the track they dance to at the end wasn’t released for another 24 years (in 1987).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What this misses, though, is that Johnny Castle is a time traveller.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the surface, it’s easily misunderstood as being nothing more than a slightly edgy coming of age film (with a catchy soundtrack) telling the story of Frances ‘Baby’ Houseman’s journey to womanhood through her encounters with Johnny Castle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dirty Dancing, though often misunderstood, is one of the great time travel films.  A thread.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My guilty pleasure is watching Grey’s Anatomy. What’s yours?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Obviously there are some attitudes that find expression in what’s said (or now through social media posts) which should be challenged (especially if consistent over time), but if we’re going to exclude anyone who said dopey stuff in their teens it’s going to be slim pickings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>UK (and Australian) politics is largely made up of white private school boys, and you better believe that the majority of them ‘experimented’ a little in their younger days!  It’s the same for digging up dirt about what people said when they were younger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I find the current sensationalism around UK politicians having taken drugs in their youth weird.  If they’re going to bar anyone who ever took any sort of drug in their youth from entering politics, the pool of eligible candidates is going to be pretty shallow.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>God used her powerfully despite the opposition; it’s time to put down the stones.  Thank God for RHE; may she rest in peace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All the attempts at controlling how people engage with the biblical texts (and, indeed, how they engage with God), all the power plays, all the name-calling, all the arrogant sneering — all of it, ultimately, futile.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And she helped millions.  All the huffing and puffing has been shown up for what it is, and we would do well, my brothers, to learn from this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it’s also shown how impotent the attacks on people like RHE from (mostly) angry men are. Don’t get me wrong: I can only imagine how deeply hurtful these attacks are, and they are incredibly disappointing, but RHE stared them down and went about what she felt called to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We don’t need to have this discussion in the Church anymore: women and men are equally gifted by God. Who are we to stand in God’s way?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It should be a no-brainer, but women’s voices are so important. To try to silence them robs us all (women and men) of wisdom and insight that we so desperately need.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve been spending time today reading through the tributes and reflections from many, many women, and have been struck by the depth and breadth of RHE’s impact. It’s truly extraordinary.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The lie is still being peddled (by the media and politicians) that the #Adani coal mine will create 8,500-10,000 jobs. How many times must it be said that the real figure will be significantly smaller than this (~1,500 on average)?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If you’re going to vote for minor or micro parties this upcoming election (and it’s a not necessarily a bad idea to consider using your preferences thoughtfully to do so), please take the time to interrogate the party’s selection process...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it speaks to a serious character deficiency on the part of the candidate, as well as a clear lack of competency on the part of the party in vetting potential candidates.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What annoys me more than just about anything, though, is when some pork chop runs as a candidate for whatever party, gets elected (not due to anyone actually voting for them but for the party name), and then decides to go out on their own.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That is, I’d love to see fewer politicians and economists telling us about specific budget measures, and more analysis by ethicists and sociologists and historians and philosophers and theologians (and so on and so forth).  Put that on TV; I’d watch it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want to know how these decisions will either reduce rising inequality or contribute to it. I want to know what it means for us as human beings, not just as ‘economic units.’<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What I’d love to see is budget analysis that seeks to link specific budget measures to the kind of political values that undergird such decisions. I’d like to hear about what these decisions mean for us as a society — not just for the next election cycle but for the long-term.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know this is shaped by the self-interest of media consumers (ie. ‘give them what they want’) but this, in turn, is shaped by political discourse that pits us against each other through zero sum game rhetoric. (Ultimately, all of this is the natural outcome of neoliberalism.)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What are we doing in our churches if it’s not leading to whole of life change?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How could anyone truly encounter grace and not feel drawn towards a more excellent way — to lives that are no longer compartmentalised but instead where perfect love seeps into every part of our brokenness and draws us towards wholeness?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If we truly took our discipleship seriously I’m convinced that we’d see deep, lasting change. How could anyone read the stories about Jesus and think there’s room for any of this rubbish?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If these people — in fact if all of us Christians (myself included) — took their faith more seriously I’m convinced we’d see far less corruption, greed, narcissism, bullying, abuse, and predatory behaviour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nevertheless, though it may sound counterintuitive, I would suggest (taking my lead from theologian Miroslav Volf) that what we need is for these people to take their religion more seriously, not less.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And so on and so forth.  It’s incredibly depressing/infuriating.  With all this in mind, it might seem logical to suggest that all religion is toxic — that it’s a corrupting influence and needs to be removed from public life. I can understand that inclination.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We’ve seen Christians in some of the most senior positions in the banking industry overseeing straight-up corruption and extraordinary greed. We constantly see Christian politicians who use the ‘family values’ line to get themselves elected revealed as total hypocrites.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We’ve seen Christians overseeing a form of ‘human sacrifice’ by working to make the lives of people seeking asylum even worse than what they fled in order to discourage others from attempting to reach Australia by boat (but not by plane, apparently).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We’ve seen clergy at the highest levels not just covering up the horrific abuse of children (as if that wasn’t bad enough) but perpetrating these sickening crimes themselves.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@johnpauldickson Thanks for that. What about anger? Or even tears? Can they be 'non-problematic,' or at least genuine human responses that aren't necessarily cover or compensation for inadequate arguments? (I'm not so much concerned about "putting one's interlocutors off.")<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnpauldickson It's obviously an excellent example of everything you say, but I have a question: Would it make a difference for you if he had raised his voice? If so, why?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TYLERG927 @LyleShelton @AuConservatives A group of people have been custodians of it for thousands of years. They have asked, respectfully and repeatedly, for people not to climb it because it is sacred to them. It seems like a blatant violation of the golden rule to continue to ignore them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuanaGoriss Fair enough. Anyway, I do appreciate the conversation. Shalom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuanaGoriss Aboriginal people have, politely and patiently, been asking for a long time for people not to climb it, but have largely been ignored. I’d prefer no ‘ban’ and for people to stop climbing it out of respect, but that hasn’t happened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuanaGoriss For sure! I don’t worship the rock (or any Temple/Church), but I do give thanks for the grandeur of Creation. And I also recognise that, in God’s wisdom, the Aboriginal people have cared for Creation in that place for thousands of years. For them, it’s a sacred space.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuanaGoriss I’m a Christian, so my answer is going to be ‘the God of Jesus.’ I’m happy to acknowledge this and also the fact that it has been a sacred site for my Aboriginal brothers and sisters for millennia. That doesn’t diminish it in any way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuanaGoriss There were areas Gentiles could not go. And areas women could not go. And areas Jewish men who were not priests could not go. Think of Uluru like that. Go and see it and walk around it and fly over it, but don’t go onto the sacred areas. It’s pretty simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuanaGoriss A Temple was built on the sacred site that had areas off limits to all sorts of people. At Uluru, the ‘temple’ was already built, and the spaces just as sacred.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuanaGoriss Sacred space on which the Temple was eventually built and became one of the most contested places in all of human history. Uluru has been a sacred space for even longer, and the site of sacred ceremony for hundreds of generations. Try a little respect.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MollyIsles Again, we’re talking about human beings. Perhaps one of your New Years resolutions could be to spend a little less time dehumanising people. #justasuggestion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyIsles You talk about ‘them’ with such disdain. ‘They’ are fellow human beings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@manis13 @nyunggai No one is saying that. The point is that we said ‘never again’, and yet we are now locking up people who are ‘genuine’ refugees in desperate situations. Our detention policy is specifically designed to crush people with hopelessness (as a sign to others).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bindicolechocka People having access to UNHCR processing in a region that was working together to place refugees and with generous intakes would certainly provide incentive not to get on a leaky boat. People get on the boats (and still do!) because they feel like they have no other options.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bindicolechocka It is a lie that ‘there is no other option’ — one that has been cynically wielded by politicians.  I’ve outlined a number of policy measures above that are not ‘open borders’. There is a world of possibility between ‘open borders’ &amp; destroying real humans as an example to others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bindicolechocka You’re right; I’m not willing to crush a group of men, women, and children as a sign to others (the overwhelming majority of whom are ‘genuine refugees’) that they shouldn’t do everything in their power to find peace and safety for themselves and their families.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DocNMFC Again, name the places.  Some have left, yes. Some have decided that at least they have a chance at finding another option rather than remaining in purgatory.  Also, there is a difference between ‘being soft on policy’ and working for good policy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DocNMFC ‘Facts’, huh? Let’s start with ‘anywhere they want’? Name the places.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steven90809999 There are all sorts of reasons that lead to people being displaced. A number of them are out of our control, some are influenced by what we do. We can look into some of those things, which might help at least lower the numbers. Nobody wants to be displaced.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hereticaliberal Haha! This a parody account, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bindicolechocka That’s what the well-funded UNHCR processing and regional framework will be able to determine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hereticaliberal A non-argument to what? All you’ve provided is ill-informed trolling to this point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DocNMFC @nyunggai Nothing about the impact our policies have had on real human beings. It’s easy to ignore the human cost when you remain at the level of generalisations and talking points.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hereticaliberal So you don’t, huh? Big surprise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hereticaliberal You don’t know any refugees, do you. If you did, you’d realise that your caricature above bears no resemblance to reality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oliver_minchin There are very few truly ‘safe’ options for people seeking asylum. We’ve sought to make the Australian option seem worse than what they’re fleeing (that is the purpose of the policy), and this drives them to seek other options, very few of which are ‘safe’.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bindicolechocka Use even just some of the massive funding for offshore detention centres to better fund UNHCR processing (esp. close to countries of origin), establish a truly regional cooperation and intake framework, and increase overall refugee intake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bindicolechocka @nyunggai Firstly, you’re arguing with me, Bindi. You jumped in on this.  Secondly, for a number of years I’ve spent time getting to know people seeking asylum/refugees, helped churches offer practical support for them, and met with numerous politicians to find better ways. Is tgat enough?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simrob72 @bindicolechocka @nyunggai What do you think you’d do in the same situation, Simon?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simrob72 @bindicolechocka @nyunggai Go to NZ (when the NZ PM has offered multiple times)? Nah, our Government put the kybosh on that. Go to places where they won’t have fundamental human rights? Not an option you’d take, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bindicolechocka @nyunggai Please outline those pathways for me, Bindi (and when you’ve done so, explain what happens to the multitudes who can and will lose many decades of life waiting for any sort of non-existent queue that people sometimes point to).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steven90809999 @bindicolechocka @nyunggai You are right about the extraordinary number of displaced people, and this is precisely why we can’t pretend that it’s not our problem too. Not all of them are trying to get to Australia, though, so let’s stick with real life scenarios here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bindicolechocka @nyunggai People are still dying in their search for safety. We’ve just pushed it out of our sight (and therefore out of mind). Search deeper into these ‘facts’ that you’re seemingly so confident of.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Johnhasmysay @aspiemark @nyunggai People, including children, have been attempting suicide. What do you think this says about their outlook on the situation?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mac1958 @bindicolechocka @nyunggai Repeating uninformed slogans and name-calling, eh? Is that really the best you’ve got?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simrob72 @bindicolechocka @nyunggai So it’s ‘personal responsibility’ to go back to places where their lives may well be in danger? That doesn’t seem like an option you or I would be happy with, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bindicolechocka @nyunggai Leaving off for a moment the fact that it hasn’t ‘stopped’ these things (it’s just pushed them somewhat out of our site), what has it done to the actual individuals? We can’t undo the irreparable damage and trauma that these people have experienced by quoting slogans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nyunggai I’d love to hear you (or Kenny, or Downer) explain in your own words — without resorting to Liberal Party slogans — the real impact that indefinite detention has had and is having on individual human lives (including children).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m a bit confused: the people who most loudly promote political and economic individualism are also the first to erase any sense of individual identify with phrases like ‘young people of African appearance’.  It’s almost like skin colour overrides the regular rules.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I watched the film ‘Solo: a Star Wars Story’ on the plane, and I thought it was pretty good.  My one observation is that it felt like Alden Ehrenreich’s Han Solo was kind of like Chris Pine’s James T. Kirk had somehow found his way into a Star Wars caper.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Churches have sometimes (perhaps often) responded to DFV in our communities in ways that have left victims unsafe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“Domestic violence is the single greatest cause of death, I’ll health, and disability for women aged under 45 in Australia.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In Australia, “[m]ost family, domestic, and sexual violence is against women, by men.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“DFV can happen in any intimate relationship across the socio-economic strata regardless of ethnicity, culture, wealth, sexuality, physical ability, age, education, or religion.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“DFV is a violation of human rights &amp; a crime. It includes any behaviour, in an intimate or family relationship, which is violent, threatening, coercive or controlling, causing a person to live in fear...often manifested as part of a pattern of controlling or coercive behaviour.”<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I’m talking very specifically here about public funding going to very high fee paying schools. I’m 100% happy for them to do their thing, but I can’t find a justification for them receiving public funding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m also not of the opinion that public funding should be restricted entirely to public schools. Non-government schools play an important role, and need to be adequately funded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the record, I’m not at all ‘anti’ private schools. I think they can be great! (In fact, if we had the cash, I think we would be very interested in sending our daughters to an excellent private school just down the road from us.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>According to the SRS, the base amount needed for a school to meet the educational needs of its students is: – $10,953 per primary school student – $13,764 per high school student  If a school is charging fees well above that amount, why would they need additional public funding?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Secondly, it got me wondering how many times my friends and I had over-sexualised conversations as young guys which made the young women around us uncomfortable (or feel unsafe), while I/we remained clueless. For any time if/when that happened, ladies, I’m genuinely sorry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Despite the young woman repeating that she wanted to change the conversation (and clearly looking uncomfortable about the situation), the young guys kept going. Who’s having these conversations with young blokes before it gets to some stranger telling them to pull their heads in?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The young guys looked sheepish and the young woman silently mouthed ‘thank you’.  A couple of thoughts:  Firstly, we’ve still got a long way to go in terms of changing attitudes and culture.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After hearing this for a while I ended up letting them know that it was pretty hard not to overhear their conversation and that, as the young woman had asked a number of times to change the topic, they were now in the territory of sexual harassment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Over and over again, the young guys kept bringing the conversation back to dick size (both in general terms and not-so-subtle hints at specifics) and whether or not they could see the young woman’s phone (while asking if she had nude pictures of herself on it).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BrionyScott Yes, indeed!  (I do wonder whether socialisation plays a role, hence the quotation marks around 'naturally'.

<|startoftext|>What if churches have largely been excluding women from many forms of leadership, and we have missed out on these God-given gifts and perspectives?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What if none of this was a 'weakness'? What if this is exactly the kind of leadership that we need to see more of? What if we have mistakenly come to define 'leadership' in inherently male categories, and have subsequently missed out on so much leadership potential?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What if women do tend, in general, towards leadership styles that are more nurturing &amp; collaborative &amp; aimed at creating the space for the wellbeing/flourishing of those around them?

<|startoftext|>@Greg_LakeAU critique is good and necessary and you're right to raise it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Greg_LakeAU p.s. I'm speaking here only for me personally, not as an official spokesperson for the group. This is how I see it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Greg_LakeAU it is also genuinely seeking engagement with (and prayer for) the politicians involved—to seek their full humanity too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Greg_LakeAU in regards to the latter point, it has at least 'succeeded' in drawing together an otherwise unlikely group of people to act.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Greg_LakeAU having said that, obviously there's a strategy to try to engage others and to change the conversation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Greg_LakeAU part of the deal is doing what (I/we feel) is right no matter if there's a headline in it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Greg_LakeAU for me, I guess it's an imperfect attempt to be faithful (and genuine in prayer, mind you), as well as seeking to be strategic.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PeterPilt what I'm saying is that your support for victims of IS is weakened by ignoring the victims of Israel in Gaza.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterPilt I for one am sickened and appalled by the violence, no matter who commits it. I will call out war crimes by Israel *and* IS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterPilt to call out Israel's atrocities is not to support Hamas or to minimise the suffering of others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterPilt if all life is equal, and I agree it is, then we need to be outraged by all these situations and not minimise any.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterPilt the US has still not stopped arming Israel, and those bombs are responsible for blowing apart innocent children.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterPilt also, world leaders seem *much* quicker to act in Iraq, eith the US already bombing IS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterPilt this is not true, however, because there has been a massive upgrade in the reporting on Iraq as it's unfolded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterPilt this is what you seem upset by, with an alleged focus only on Gaza to the detriment of reporting on Iraq and Syria.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterPilt if all life is equally valuable, then you need to be able to not minimise the suffering of one to promote that of the other.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterPilt if you are concerned with apparent hypocrisy, then to play down the brutal reality of the situation in Gaza is not ok.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterPilt Firstly, your use of 'hypothetical' vs 'reality' masks the terrifying reality of numerous murdered innocent children in Gaza.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>.@ScottMorrisonMP, as we begin to rediscover the humanity of #asylumseekers (and, in turn, our own), we invite you to rediscover yours too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But in all that we do we can never dehumanise the dehumanisers, for to do so is already to have lost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's time for #creativenonviolence where the attitudes and structures that breed such dehumanisation are brought into the light.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's time to tell family and friends that conversations where #asylumseekers are robbed of their humanity are not acceptable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's time to reclaim our nation's soul and to say a firm NO! to the dehumanisation of the vulnerable and powerless. #asylumseekers<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@atenni he knows what it feels like to experience marginalisation, which is why I think he resonates so well with so many.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atenni absolutely agree, but also add in where he has come from and former addiction. His insight has the added benefit of being personal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atenni I guess my concern is that disengagement from the current process/system may be understood as disengagement from 'politics'.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ok, enough ranting about dodgy hermeneutics. I'm getting too worked up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's a tip: the New Testament does not in any way speak of a 'rapture'. This escapism is diametrically opposed to the what the NT says.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm almost convinced that it's worth removing the book of Revelation from the Christian canon, purely because it's so easily misunderstood.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So many pastors/preachers speak so confidently about the book of Revelation with so little understanding about it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@joshuajballard my 'prejudice' is against what the man stands for. I thought I was allowed to have an opinion, and to vote accordingly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshuajballard an apology for Abbott playing the Australian public for fools? I'll be sorry alright; for at least the next three years!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WarWraith it saddens me to admit how true this is : (<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WarWraith oh. I did not know that. I'm still not sure I understand it fully, but I nevertheless now feel dirty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WarWraith which one? 'Multiculturalism'? I'm all for redeeming the word and investing it with nuanced meaning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's both possible and necessary to see ethnocultural differences as beautiful, and to welcome, appreciate and celebrate them together.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The aim of #multiculturalism is not the #meltingpot (eventual monoculturalism), but the #tossedsalad (differences that can be appreciated).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The end of #racism doesn't mean ignoring ethnic differences; it means being able to recognise such differences without a value judgment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even apparently subtle (or 'lighthearted') forms of racism are absorbed as if by osmosis by young minds. #RacismStopsWithMe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But it's not enough just to focus on the things that make it to the news. We must challenge racism in *all* its forms wherever it occurs.<|endoftext|>
