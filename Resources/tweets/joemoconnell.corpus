<|startoftext|>@AmericanAir BUT I was told in Tucson that I would be put up in a Dallas hotel. I WAS LIED TO. Make it right. I ended up having to stay in Minute Suites at major expense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Escaped the @DFWAirport after night in box-like room (at my expense) when @AmericanAir broke promise of a paid hotel room. PAY UP! Grandma in airport tells grandchild: "We're like zombies putting one foot in front of the other." #TravelTuesday #travelwriter #Dallas #Texas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmericanAir: It's not about the flight. It's about the broken promise to put me up in a hotel room at @DFWAirport. When I got there they refused. I paid $155 for the "closet" sleeping space in the airport. Reimburse me. Not miles. Not voucher. Reimburse me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Things to do at the @DFWAirport late at night after @AmericanAir nixes promised hotel room:  1. Create show tunes using self-flushing toilets. 2. Arrange vending machine candy into SOS sign. 3. Think up better names for "customer service."  #TravelTuesday #travelwriter #Dallas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Living at the @DFWAirport after @AmericanAir  promises hotel room then takes it away. (Cancelling AA @citi card tomorrow.) #TravelTuesday #travelwriter #Dallas #Texas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Joined a gang of airport-dwelling toughs. The initiation involves sleeping in $155 @DFWAirport closet and eating vending machine candy after @AmericanAir promises hotel room then takes it away. (Cancelling AA @citi card tomorrow.) #TravelTuesday #travelwriter #Dallas #Texas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ghosts of angry customers on the moving #airport sidewalks? Scary late night living at @DFWAirport after @AmericanAir nixed promised hotel room. #TravelTuesday #travelwriter #Dallas  #texas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Playing poker with the stewardesses to escape my $155 @DFWAirport closet after @AmericanAir nixed promised hotel room. #TravelTuesday #travelwriter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got a job mopping @DFWAirport bathrooms to pay for my $155 closet after @AmericanAir nixed promised hotel room after THEIR flight delay. Cancelling AA @askciti cards tomorrow. #traveltuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least my $155 @DFWAirport closet has free wifi so I can continue to remind @AmericanAir that they lied about providing a hotel room after their delay led to missed flight. I'm concocting a dance routine to dazzle other angry customers. I've (apparently) got all night...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm be sleeping in the airport, showering in the @DFWAirport bathroom and dining on @mcdonalds. Where's my promised hotel room,  @AmericanAir?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Held hostage at the @DFWAirport by @AmericanAir. Flight from Tucson delayed. Ticket agent promised hotel room in Dallas with new flight in the a.m. Dallas "customer service" says "weather" (airport talk for "take a hike"). Now paying $155 to sleep in airport closet. #citicard?<|endoftext|>
