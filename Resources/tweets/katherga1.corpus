<|startoftext|>The list of countries- from all over globe- &amp; orgs condemning US sanctioning of #ICC prosecutor for mass atrocity/torture accountability investigations is LONG. The political/diplomatic cost of such a misguided act, on top of basic undermining of rule of law, warrants rescinding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenWarren THANK YOU @SenWarren &amp; more colleagues join you in speaking out &amp; condemning this assault on independence of judiciary/justice.  @theCCR agrees: "U.S. Sanctions on ICC Prosecutor Constitute ‚ÄúFull Frontal Attack on Rule of Law,‚Äù Human Rights Attorneys Say"  https://t.co/390u2xMjgz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For US-based groups: the not-perfect #ICC may seem disconnected frm critical issues at home/on streets (* &amp; raises q's re: abolition) but the politicization of int'l justice &amp; interference w/judicial proceedings in this way echoes protection of powerful/denials of justice at home<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For int'l community: #ICC Member States, esp politically powerful, MUST advocate for rescinding of sanctions for all international civil servants with equal force as they would (&amp; have?) advocate for their own nationals. This is an attack against int'l justice, thru Trumpian lens<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Critical #ICC sanctions be understood in larger context of anti-Black, if not white supremacist, administration: The targeting of two African staff &amp; effort to deny justice to majority-Muslim victims in #Afghanistan &amp; #Palestine situations is extension of domestic racist policies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The timing of the sanctions-on the heels of Pompeo's trip to #Israel, w/no new developments in on-hold #Afghanistan situation (note, deferral request followed his trip to Kabul)- suggests as much about #Palestine case as US #torture. Pleasing one ally comes at cost of a continent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Expressing "unwavering" support for #ICC, #EU calls on the Trump admin to undo sanctions &amp; end interference in judicial proceedings: "The United States should reconsider its position &amp; reverse the measures it has taken. Impunity must never be an option."  https://t.co/J2yMRAZDh5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #ICC is a court of last resort. These victims turned to the ICC only because national systems have been unwilling or unable to hold those who bear the greatest responsibility to account. Their long struggle for justice is truly one of life &amp; death. #EndImpunity #JusticeForAll<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I keep coming back to the victims, &amp; justice delayed if not denied to them by these wholly misguided sanctions.

<|startoftext|>Public International Law scholars -&amp; I know there are more than a few of you on twitter- sign-on's to this statement setting out the non-controversial position that unilateral #annexation is #illegal under #internationallaw are still being accepted. Consider adding your name.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@SenatorMetzger, thank you for your votes this week to #Repeal50A &amp; #PoliceSTATAct. One more is critical to address #PoliceBrutalityPandemic: Repeal the #WalkingWhileTrans ban.  #BlackLivesMatter #BlackTransLivesMatter<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Can I see a tweet - and vote - like this from my NYS senator, @SenatorMetzger, a member of the @NYWFP? This was the call at Sunday's protest with hundreds of constituents in Callicoon, on the bridge in Narrowsburg. #Repeal50A #DefendBlackLives #EndPoliceBrtualityPandemic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeckerC #ICC #Palestine - here's the link to the #Prosecutor's response:  https://t.co/0rcNTy2tOJ #Accountability #OpenTheInvestigation #EndTheOccupation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hundreds of your constituents gathered in Callicoon Sunday, @SenatorMetzger, for a powerful, often painful, coming together to bear witness, stand in #solidarity &amp; commit to act to #DismantleWhiteSupremacy. #Repeal50A was on agenda- vote to do so! #NoJusticeNoPeaceNoRacistPolice  https://t.co/SpCBmWcR63<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NEW: #ICC #Palestine: Prosecutor's response just filed. Abbas's statement has no bearing on ICC jurisdiction/Palestine's status as a State Party. Reiterates concern re: #Israel's imminent unilateral #annexation; it has "no legal validity" &amp; law of occupation continues to apply.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Political education must be grounded in empathy &amp; followed by action to #DismantleWhiteSupremacy &amp; other forms of racism/discrimination. Tbh, that's where I struggle but @CPRAction @ColorOfChange @Law4BlackLives @Mvmnt4BlkLives @lexicon91 @mayafinoh show egs how/where to step up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's same reason that when the US drafted its #Torture Statute, it made clear it was only punishing torture -severe physical or mental harm under "color of law"/state action- that happens outside US. While we use the law for social justice ends, remmber it's product of the system<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Widespread &amp; systematic violations against civilians =#crimesagainsthumanity. When done on a discriminatory basis, including on race, they are the crime of #persecution. #PoliceBrutalityPandemic IS persecution. Ever wonder why US doesn't have a CAH statute? IMO, this is reason #1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great! Now a concrete step you can take to help #DefendBlackLife is support #Repeal50A -without amendments - &amp; full set of police accountability/transparency bills. As your constituent, I call on you to make clear your/NY42 support @changethenypd<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Finally, saying that the #ICC proceedings have thus far not had "dissuasive effect" on #Israel, #Palestine asks PTC to shorten deadlines, ask if Israel will respond, &amp; avoid further delays to investigation, during which Israeli authorities "carry out criminal plan"  https://t.co/GXYsSKsbJJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Palestine: Abbas' statement reiterates what is true under international law: as Occupying Power, Israel has obligations twds population BUT occupation (&amp; annexation) do transfer sovereignty or alter status.

<|startoftext|>I found decision to be striking read in this moment-a return to certain first principles: right to be presumed innocent; right to be free of cruel &amp; unusual punishment; absolute prohibition on torture &amp; right to remedy if it occurs; &amp; centrally: inherent right of all to #dignity<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We are truly in an insane (and terrifying) moment that this is what is being written &amp; discussed (I litigated horror of Nisoor Sq).

<|startoftext|>@AktGat @greeneyedbrahma idk. "Terrorism" is a politically-useful label that has been employed to justify war against &amp; imprisonment of Black &amp; brown people, esp since 9/11. Torture -severe physical or mental harm under color of law- has been universally recognized as a crime for 100s of years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And don't think it's a coincidence that the Torture Statute (18 USC 2340) only applies OUTSIDE the United States. It was adopted 3 years after Rodney King was beaten -tortured- by the LAPD. The law should permit #PoliceBrutality to be called by its proper name: #torture.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As trump muses abt sending the military on to American streets to use force against citizens -civilians- he might remember that unlike the Torture Statute, the War Crimes Act (18 USC 2441) applies for US military inside the United States. Serious bodily injury, torture=war crimes<|endoftext|>
