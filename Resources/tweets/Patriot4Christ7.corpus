<|startoftext|>It will be it's coming over the next few days. Then it will be it's here.  I can't wait until it's here and we are like, "What's coming tomorrow? Who's Next? I can't sleep cause I am too excited!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It used to be we'd get a BQQM every couple weeks. Then it was every week. Then, every day. Now, it's multiple per day.  It used to be "It's coming soon".

<|startoftext|>Because COVID has killed less than 15,000 people.  The key is the word WITH and the $13K hospitals get when they check the COVID box.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me too. If Jill Biden and the other ridiculous people deciding they get to tell us what to do because they have a DR before their name, then I want in.  I am not a Dr so my COVID thoughts now matter to everybody.  No Masks, No Vaccines, No Social Distances, No Lockdowns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why? Has any other potential president ever done this before? Why does Biden have to speak to the 2,000 people that will tune in? Who is writing his script?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottPresler @KLoeffler I notice she is the only one virtue signaling with a mask. Interesting.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EdwardPentin @dibanezgut @NCRegister Ugly as sin. Pope is not a friend to the Catholic Church. It is time to clean out the deep church. Filled with wolves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RadeckiTammy @EdwardPentin @dibanezgut @NCRegister You best define "they" and gain a true understanding of the Catholic church before spouting this like Gospel.

<|startoftext|>This is pathetic and shameful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I HATE HOAs.   It should be illegal to tell someone what they can and cannot do with their own home and land, no matter how much land or how little they have.   HOAs are a form of control I will never submit to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Athletes are now professional virtue signalers.   Their pathetic pandering has caused this guy to ditch all sports. It's simply not worth watching anymore. Pro sports has been rigged for years and college just isn't fun with the way they do it now.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@1PatriotForLife @realDonaldTrump Same with most 4 me.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MsAvaArmstrong @MikeB67850263 Cut 535 specific people's pay to 0 and watch this country open up in about 5 seconds.

<|startoftext|>@asc96b No worries. I get it. Things happen and it can get a person down. It's not easy being a Patriot these days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@asc96b Did I say I know God's plan or is that more of your negativity coming out?  If I knew God's Plan I wouldn't need faith. I have Faith in God. I know God Wins and if you read the bible, you know many characters are down and look defeated before they win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle Will you be up all night Mr. President??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lisachristinect Hope those in CA own plenty of guns and have ammo. Gonna need it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@asc96b Negativity won't get you you were you're trying to go.  Ask yourself, why would you need to trust the plan if you knew the plan?  We, the general public know about 5% of what's going on, at best.   We trust the plan because we have faith in God, not Man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is coming. Don't fret Patriots. Treason is on the table and will be the charge for so very many horrific demon-infested humans.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Dubz__Nation @tracybeanz When it's rooted in God &amp; you see the stories in the bible, the winner is ALWAYS so far down they have no chance, but with God, they win.  We, the People can't do this without God. Trust the Plan is akin to having Faith in God. If the phrase doesn't work for you, fine. Trust GOD!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dubz__Nation @tracybeanz We must remain patient in prayer. Yes, you should be pissed, we all should, and that's okay. Even God allowed characters in the bible to get pissed and question him. 1 7 is by no means God, but 1 7 is an instrument of God to help us all have a clue before the SHTF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dubz__Nation @tracybeanz necessary, but there is a plan. Evil cannot be defeated in the darkness. It must come into the light and most of what has been going on this entire year is for mass population awakening in little bits and pieces.   The bigger booms have yet to come, but it's days away...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dubz__Nation @tracybeanz This just shows you're listening to too many shills. There are a lot of people out there talking a big game that have no clue.   1 7 has shown several times to be truthful and many things that 1 7 has said came true. Also warned us, the military is the only way.  Logic is...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anonpatriotq We moved to IN and I wanted to take him with us. Darn living closer to family crap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is VITAL. Do your homework. Pay attention Stay Calm. Learn about the Insurrection Act and know 1 7 and what we were told.  Trust the Plan because we are not given the ENTIRE PLAN. If you knew it, you wouldn't need to trust it, but if you knew it, so would the DS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnBasham If that happened, it would be  civil war and after it's over you'd have one country again.   It won't come to this. Military comes first and that will handle it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dubz__Nation @tracybeanz Patience. If we knew the plan we wouldn't have to trust the plan, but if we knew the plan, so would the leftist DS assholes.  We are given enough to make educated guesses.   I guarantee this was part of the plan and many of us saw it coming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gregkellyusa @EuropeNextYear We are just getting started.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElijahSchaffer Nope. Not done in the courts and there is still the Insurrection act, along with the Electors and Congress.  Far from over. Heck, we've barely even started.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenateGOP @US_FDA @pfizer Bet if every Congress person lost their pay until we were 100% open this country would be open in about 5 seconds!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenateGOP @US_FDA @pfizer No it's not. We put it behind us by realizing it has a 99.997% survival rate and a vaccine is NOT required.  Quarantine the sick and let everybody get back to living their lives.   It's not that difficult and it's pathetic you are touting a vaccine when you already know this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Thinkologist1 @jsolomonReports Exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sundayze1221 @jsolomonReports Masks do nothing and nobody dies SUDDENDLY of COVID.   It was something else and they are passing it off as COVID.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abulinixish @jsolomonReports If you believe 3,000 ppl died from COVID, you best look at the other causes of death for the day.   Miraculously, COVID has cured the flu, heart disease, and cancer this year since those deaths are way down.  Keyword on this one is SUDDENDLY.   That means it wasn't COVID.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@yeager_sophia @DrTomFrieden It is sad that you fall for this crap and just believe it without question.  Break the brainwashing and stop listening to fear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BushallSam1 @DrTomFrieden Who is really the selfish? You who wants to force me to wear a mask and do a whole bunch of other shit so you feel safe or me that takes the time to listen to more than just the brainwashing MSM news fear mongerers and actually see the truth they refuse to share??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BushallSam1 @DrTomFrieden No most of us see thru the BS. Even the CDC has admitted the vast majority died maybe with COVID but not from COVID. not to mention, the deaths from virtually every other major cause of death are suddenly way down since COVID started.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Biden lied again. If he had fractured his foot, he would likely still be in a cast (which he never was) and there is no way he would already be out of a boot.   The man is 78. What did they do pump a bunch of adrenochrome into his foot?  Even if you voted for Biden you have...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is called communism.   It's like when someone gives you something "for free" but want's to tell you how to use it and that you cannot get rid of it without their permission.  Free stuff from the government is NEVER FREE!  Don't fall for this shit. It's a control tactic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ilhan This is called communism.

<|startoftext|>When small businesses have to close because power-hungry government overlords for them to, the owners stop getting paid.  I think, every single time any elected official doesn't show up to work, they should stop getting paid.   Open up or lose your cushy government gig!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Up the ladder we go.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hey @jack. Hey @Twitter I dispute all claims from Biden and Democrats.  Start lebeling thier posts as disputed now you fake news frauds.  Censorship is your game. A jail cell with bubba is where you'll be very soon.  Soy boy = controlled bitch in prison.  Enjoy!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MouthyMa717 Squirrel finding a nut??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Christ called the Children to Him when the disciples scoffed.  Christ is the way of LIFE.  Joe Biden an the Democratic Party is the way of death.  Satan is the author of Death.  Wake up and follow Christ or Die.  Your choice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sin is what you seek through laziness and voting for a puppet of the death party.  If you think yoy can vote for Biden and be Christisn, your bible has been neglected and you've been fooled by Satan.  Christ made it clear many would think they knew Him, but did not know him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is who you vote for democrats.  If you knew how to research, you might know better.  If you were not led by hatred, you might know better.  If you were not seeking handouts b/c you crave laziness, you might know better.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This could be HUGE!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So by that logic we can move the goalposts too. Let's just say due to COVID President Trump will stay in office until March 20th so we can get thru flu season.  That should buy enough time to show Biden's true vote tally of about 45 million.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realTrumpForce Enough to let him keep his life but in prison. No concession equals death by hanging.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@egregiousknave @dananessel @JoeBiden No. This is not a bravo moment. You guys never realize your virtue signaling is doing nothing but showing your bigotry.  Merry Christmas is a nice wish for someone to have a good holiday season.If you take it as something else, you probably grew up getting participation trophies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShlomoAbrin @dananessel @JoeBiden Say that to me and I will probably tell you Merry Christmas again.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kasie You should look up Biden in 1987 and in 2007.   Discover why he didn't make it through the primaries and it will shed some light on your brainwashed mind.    Yes, one of Trump or Biden is a big fat liar, but which one will surprise you when you have all the info.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When will MSM report this? When will those with a platform put this out? It should be everywhere!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes immediately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's probably a lie anyway. Plus the first time around more hospital capacity was created in days by the Trump Admin.   If it was real, Trump would deploy the Army to build a temporary hospital. Until that happens, it's just lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You won't ever hear this from a single news channel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brian, it's not too late. You can step out of the darkness and into the light.  Actions speak louder than words and God is watching. This is your moment. What will you do?<|endoftext|>

Enjoy the Show.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnyFox_cc @Rothbard1776 @realDonaldTrump Yes, you are the crazy one because you don't finish reading articles all the way through and you believe what CNN, NYT and other MSM feed you.

<|startoftext|>She doesn't have a new president and she's a slimy old hag working for Satan.  It's about time for people to stand up to this b**ch and throw her out of power. She belongs in jail, along with her slimy husband and nephew.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Maybe it's time to do actual journalistic reporting Wolf and report on the evidence that has been shown.   Keep in mind, the evidence we, the public, have seen is about 5% of the evidence gathered. It barely scratches the surface, yet puts more than 1 million votes...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you buy that Biden, got 81 million votes, you are as dumb as they come.  The dude couldn't get 81 people to show up for him at a rally and barely left the basement.  At least 25% of his votes were manufactured, F R A U D, or coerced.   A mountain of evidence proves this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope. It has produced a bunch of brainwashed liberals with no critical thinking skills.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe it's time to dismiss Judge Emmet Sullivan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. This is so true. Too many brainwashed zombies just doing what their overlords tell them to do without even stopping for a second to ask a single question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They try to mandate vaccines and guns will become a matter of public health. Their health will be threatened every single time they knock on a door of a gun owner with a brain capable of figuring out a vaccine isn't necessary for a virus with a 99.997% survival rate.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MaryamHenein @tribunal_watch Vaccines aren't necessary for something with a 99.997% survival rate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This needs to be everywhere. Reach ALL Americans.   RT &amp; Share Far and Wide!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How about a lethal injection instead??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time for Teachers being forced to do this to STRIKE!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pope Francis is in bed with a bunch of people that support Abortion on Demand and Infanticide. He cannot rationalize his sin. More akin to the Devil than Christ.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hrkbenowen Biden can shove it right up his ass. He will never be in the WH and I will never wear a mask again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh you mean like the video evidence?   The mountains of evidence are only conspiracy theories in the minds of the corrupt.  Are you corrupt Elena or just one of the idiots that believes what CNN says??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1PatriotForLife How about just a lethal injection and end the madness already??  Oh, wait, it's bascially the same thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealBrysonGray Nope. Not a chance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He didn't fracture anything. Fractured feet in young healthy people take 4 to 6 weeks to heal enough to put weight on it.   Someone his age it could take months.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RudyGiuliani Well done good and faithful servant.   Thank you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whomever that is can go right on with fucking themselves. I will NEVER have a COVID ID in my wallet.   WE THE PEOPLE are in charge now and these made up BS Coalitions can Go straight to HELL!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. This temple will stay clean of aborted tissues from vaccines.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The dumbest thing found on the internet this year....and that's saying a lot.  When dumb brainwashed MEN stop cutting off their penises, they will stop having gaping, infected, smelly wounds.   That's science for ya!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This right here, is plenty reason for anybody under the age of 45 to avoid this vaccine at all costs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hrkbenowen He can't figure out that supporting abortion, yet being sad about a miscarriage makes no sense either. Liberal logic is illogical.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This movie has gotten so good!!  Can't wait to see the ending...coming soon (5 to 15 days)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realCarone_ You don't need to be sorry for telling the truth.  We Patriots have got to stop apologizing for telling the truth and being Patriots.  You are brave, courageous, and a TRUE Patriot for testifying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YES! RISE UP!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @Jack, you're dumbass minions are marking everything as disputed even though it's clear video evidence.  @Twitter is pathetic and so transparent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We better find a FAT LADY cause she will be singing soon.  Can't wait to see how this movie ends!  Will there be a sequel? Will the sequel include some arrests, maybe a few hangings, and plenty of confession videos?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. I was forced to wear one at the theme parks before moving away from Florida. Tried to break every rule I could to breath, but if a lawsuit like this comes up, I will be joining.  Now that we left FL, masks are a thing of the past. No more mask on my face!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time for concessions from Biden and all the down ballot candidates that cheated. It's the only way they can come close to saving themselves.   If they don't concede, there will be mass executions in 2021.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pontifex Build Back Better is BS and you are not the Pope. The sooner you admit that the better this world will be for all of us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenateGOP @RandPaul @senatemajldr @SenTedCruz @SenRickScott<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. This is correct.   I used to think it was the Democratic Party, but they are owned by China.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IT'S Time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmeraldRobinson Does anybody trust Lindsey Graham? He seems to be an easy flip flopper.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's beginning to look a lot like undeniable evidence, everywhere you go.  Take a look at the GA and PA. It's cheating once again. With voter fraud and video proof once again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is pure insanity!!  Don't lop off your penis and you won't have a stinky infected wound.  Time to reopen psych wards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ALL OTHER GOVERNORS need to follow this lead!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckCallesto Sure did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMattCouch @Annakhait @EricMMatheny @johncardillo @Beard_Vet @WatchChad @LLinWood @iheartmindy @atensnut @LoneStarCjaye @DrNealHouston I certainly won't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrayingActress @patton6966 66 isn't correct and have never been correct. That is a version of the bible riddled with translation errors and doesn't even include all the original books. It was ruins by people pissed off at corrupt humans in the Catholic Church.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Take your masks and shove it. This is battery, which is a crime punishable by time in jail. I would call the cops and press charges immediately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's battery. I would have that MF arrested immediately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe it's time for Americans to STOP PAYING TAXES!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Twentieth, President Donald J. Trump WILL Serve at the will of the People for another 4 years and he WILL drain the DS.  The year isn't over. What else will I learn in 2020? What have you learned in 2020?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Eighteenth, Many "Christian" Pastors and "Catholic" Clergymen are working for Satan, not Christ.  Nineteenth, the GOP is filled with Snakes and many are a part of the DS.  Cont...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sixteenth, Lockdowns were never meant for COVID and they don't work. They were meant to instill fear and usher in a "new normal".  Seventeenth, The Left will just redefine words at will to fit their evil agenda.  Cont...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fourteenth, Virtue Signaling is way out of control and it's the absolute worst things the Left has given us.  Fifteenth, Many people want to tell you what to do, but don't follow their own rules, not just those with power.  Cont...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Eleventh, Life is short and living in fear is a horrible way to spend it.  Twelfth, Family is vital and a family should include a Mom, Dad, and Children, not two Moms or two Dads. Sure, there are circumstances where it's not perfect, but children need Dads AND Moms.   Cont...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I have heard several stories of people being afraid, getting it, and changing how they approach it based on the fact that it was no more than a bad flu or the common cold for them. Sometimes, you have to go through it to actually see the truth.  Cont...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seventh, President Donald J. Trump is right about 99% of the time, no matter the subject. Prove me wrong on this and not with MSM BS sources that lie. Good Luck!

<|startoftext|>What have I learned so far in 2020?  First, liberals love to play the blame game, but never actually offer solutions to problems.  Second, fear is a strong motivator and many Christians need to read the bible more...it tells you not to be afraid on REPEAT!  Cont....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN Nope. You can fuck right off with this bs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickAdamsinUSA @KassandraKitson They also mean send jobs overseas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They can't our disernment is thru the roof!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMattCouch Yep in person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That tells me pretty clearly the WSJ is not one of the finest newspapers in the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dr. Birx can fuck right off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No vaccine for me. We follow Christ not modern medicine.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Truth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>10000000% FAKE! Those that don't see how Fake this is are lying to themselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You Should!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden is a complete moron. We haven't lost that many since March, especially if you subtract all the fake COVID-19 deaths that were not really COVID Deaths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He is 100000000000000% Correct!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They wouldn't understand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesOKeefIII Fake account.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right after a specific tweet they probably will...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Pope isn't the pope, but this is also BabylonBee so satire.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Check the Boot. Bet there's an ankle bracelet in there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Twatter is literally the worst. Can we get on with the arrests and making sure Trump is in for 4 more years so I can leave this horrific platform already?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@photomikeyhere Your body your choice.  I will not take this vaccine or any other vaccine until the aborted fetus tissue taken out and everything Bill Gates has touched is eradicated from this earth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This "guy" is a pussy. What a whiney POS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SaladinoShow Do it. Get this over with swiftly, fairly, and legally.   Then, arrest all those that participated in the TREASON of Election Fraud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is not a man. This is a pansy ass momma's boy that has no idea how to be a man.   He chooses to pick on people he knows he can overpower, if necessary.  He is the EXACT reason why MEN need to teach their Sons how to be MEN and not pussies.  He even looks like a big pansy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, you mean because you worship mother nature you luciferin demon. Prince Harry is a waste of brain cells at this point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When did everybody become so offended by the word MORON?  I get suspended for 12 hours at a time for pointing out that some people are morons like the idiot that claims Christianity has no central figure.   Umm, hello, JESUS Christ is the central figure.   Truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is truth. BLM is a complete scam and has nothing to do with helping anybody except elite Dems.   Where do you think Biden got most of his funding??  BLM --&gt; Act Blue --&gt; Biden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Again, never trust someone with a mole on the side of their nose. They work for evil nine times out of ten.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When that's the case, it goes from Voter Fraud to Election fraud, which makes it TREASON.   It wasn't the perfect crime, even though dumbass dems think it was.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joy65331941 @ShaneSmedley If you think MSM would report this you've still got some waking up to do.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It is called TREASON!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@105artillery @RobbersonJon 🖐🖐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Truth. And it exposes laziness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KellyBu81471167 Looks like a gay pride parade.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NEVER!! and Innocent is the KEY word here.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>PANIC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have been told this before. It's not new information, but so many people haven't woken up to this yet.   China has been working on this for decades.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>5D Chess....  Others are playing Checkers....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am one of them. This could not be said any better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another move showing how @GovRonDeSantis truly serves at the will of the people and preserves FREEDOM.  So many other governors NEED to follow his lead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because it's insanely BLUE. We just left there and it was like leaving a really odd liberal bubble.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. Gotta give it at lest 24 hours with the AP to see the truth actually come out.  They lie far too often to ever believe what they say straight up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me either. Outside a few people they are just as bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ummmmm......WOW!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time for @realDonaldTrump to do the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Makes one wonder where the $$ came from??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MsJettexas Hope it's real, but skeptical.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmericanWife2 I know nurses that found ways around that. It's coercion and it's illegal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's illegal. It cannot be forced upon anybody.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And if you believe that you are a special kind of moron.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden won't be President. He can shove this BS right up his old asshole.  There should be no taxes on guns and ammo except normal sales tax.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who blackmailed him or paid him off??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not breaking. Nobody cares.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I safe Dr. Fauci belongs in a noose. TRAITOR!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And stop requiring masks in church. It's satanic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We need more public servants and less politicians.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If true this is huge!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ummm....problem.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Why does @twitter Allow this @jack?? I thought this was something you took seriously.  This person should be sitting in a jail cell for making this threat.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What, for Garbage Person of the Year?? All 3 are evil swine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1PatriotForLife Merry CHRISTmas!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't wait until you get into office through the next election or a special election. We need people like Willie representing WE THE PEOPLE!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this is exactly what a very guilty person would do. If it was true, there would be no need to say it or even go on the defensive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden is the Leader of nothing but his own Basement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet both states were called minutes after the polls closed. Think about that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This moron is gonna have a very puckery ahole very, very soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He got 1K live viewers, yet 80 million votes. Hmmmm...even a child can see the issue here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>About time. She belong in prison.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nobody cares. We aren't done with 2020 yet. How about we stay in the game that is currently at about halftime instead of thinking about the next one.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SidneyPowell1 Represents Me and WE THE PEOPLE!!  #KeepItGoing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>100%. The libtards won't get this one bit, but those of us paying attention get it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let me correct you Politico.  The RINO chair of the House Republican Conference became the latest high-profile Republican to accept $$ or get blackmailed by the Dems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is insane!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And those are their made up number. Both are much lower, but the discrepancy is probably even bigger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's time for those in the UK to stand up and fight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ai4liberty Oh my gosh did you're little feelings get hurt?  Grow up and get over it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This IS the Democratic Party today.  They won't even admit the United States is a Constitutional Republic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He also screwed around with dudes on his so-called wife who is probably a man. Obama, the hero of so many brainwashed dems is not the person they think he is.  Corrupt, psycho, power-hungry, sold his soul to the devil a long time ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She's an idiot. Probably didn't win here election either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is simply moronic.   It's time to get rid of that MD, MS and ER Physician part after your name.  You're not smart enough to be a doctor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And @newsmax is headed down the same hole as Fox. They just can't stand their success and we already know their leadership loves the dems.   Only a handful of decent journos from either channel and they really need to leave before they get wrapped up in all this shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And they are both MEN!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ALL Restaurants and bars should follow their lead and tell the government to F off already. WE THE PEOPLE are in charge NOT Elected officials trying to play Dictator.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's how it goes. You go from normal human to demonic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another bust. Clearing out the evil!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If this doesn't get you off your A** to fight as a Christian, you probably aren't truly a Christian.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We refer to those people at Patriots! The brainwashed fools refer to us as idiots, yet they have no idea what's about to happen.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HonkSJ @lifejacket4tink The partying would be YUGE!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It won't matter. As soon as the obvious fra ud comes out at least one of the two races will not need a run off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngelicVixon Nobody I know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VincentCrypt46 @JohnBVigilant Tucker is no friend to Patriots. He IS part of MSM, the enemy of the people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnBVigilant We are the news, not Tucker. He pushed a little too far with his latest, but it is not the first time. Just like the rest of Fox, he changed as the election happened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's time to start arresting elected officials overstepping and pulling this type of shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is absolutely insane. Sadly, there are people that think this is the right thing to do because they are brainwashed fools.  It will lead to one of the biggest lawsuits every filed or the cops simply won't enforce it because they know better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If this is true and I tend to believe it probably is, then @TuckerCarlson is a snake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeadStoriesCom @MiaSchel Bullshit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She is right and his entitled brat side is showing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FishHousehold6 I get that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe "Journalist" should start getting paid based on the accuracy of what they report. Meger salary + bonuses for truthful and accurate reporting instead of millions a year to sit on a soapbox.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darindK75 @TuckerCarlson @dbongino @TimRunsHisMouth @BoSnerdley So in other words, you don't understand how cases in court work. Would you ask a lawyer for an accused murderer to show thier evidence to the press first?   Tucker showed his entitlement and that's a huge issue. He and Fox are kin to CNN. Not to be trusted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@undercoverpat1 @TuckerCarlson Sounds like an entitled liberal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Don_Fabbri I left my underwear at home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hecis Fox News and it is now dead. Who will cause an RIP 4 Newsmax cause we know they are next to go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1PatriotForLife @JoeBiden Not unless he contributed evidence or testified.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Note to Tucker &amp; the media: On top of this, you're not ENTITLED To JACK SHIT until an attorney is ready to present their case.   You're not Judge &amp; Jury. You don't decide Elections.  You're ENTIRE JOB is to find stories and report FACTS.  It's time to hold MSM accountable!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will @DailyWireNews  end up being the next Fox News first or will it be @newsmax ?  Time will tell, but neither will survive if they don't start doing actual journalistic work instead of just piggybacking off MSM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog Sadly, I must unfollow you. I know you don't care, but I have reached my limit.  Why you defend @TuckerCarlson for being just like the many other MSM journalists thinking they are entitled to evidence that hasn't been presented in court is beyond me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TuckerCarlson I used to respect you, but your pessimistic attitude killed it. I will not follow journalists that think they are entitled to evidence that hasn't been presented in court yet.  You are a part of Fox News &amp; now we know why you never switched. Enjoy the sinking ship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you want to TRULY free the People of America, you must have fair elections, but it cannot just stop there.   So many treat CNN, MSNBC, CBS, ABC, and FOX as complete Gospel.  Take down MSM and watch the brainwashed start to see the light so fast it's blinding!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mommarae1231 You earned your degree in a different way than AOC 😜<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this dumbass has an econ degree.  Thats called socialsim and government control.  Satan's deomns are strong in this one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just more proof we have Bishops that should never have been given leadership positions.  So much Evil in the Catholic Church leaders these days.   I hope cleaning the Church Deep State is swift and thorough!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheJadeGamer @USMC RIP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Colleges started brainwashimg them decades ago. On generation 2 or 3 by now.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Depoetic @JeriLRyan @Dean_Devlin @ChristianKane01 @jonathansfrakes @fmfagan @twinsmom1981 And it matters why? De Blasio won't let anybody go see it anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ctlnmcfall How about you report about how one candidate is only 0.3% away from the 50% mark and once they scour all the counties they will certainly find enough uncounted or fake votes to flip that small of a margin?  Oh wait, you don't report truth, forgot!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BQQM!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1PatriotForLife @nepheshim And that percentage is based on their inflated numbers. Take out the deaths WITH Covid, not FROM covid and it's much, much lower risk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Then I will go live off the land in the woods. This guy will NEVER willingly take a vaccine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These are not men. They were never fully raised. These are children that were abandoned and never found a proper father figure.  I would guess they don't know Christ, either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MelanieInMiami @LoneDryerSock @senpizzo @JoeGruters Take your virtue signaling mask profile picture elsewhere. Wearing a mask is a satanic ritual and socialism is one of the biggest tricks satan has ever unleashed on this world.   You'll find out soon enough. Better buckle up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MelanieInMiami @LoneDryerSock @senpizzo @JoeGruters They happen to have a handful of socialist policies and even people from those countries would tell you they don't care for quite a few of those policies.   You drank the CNN and Bernie Kool-aid by the gallon and it shows.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MelanieInMiami @LoneDryerSock @senpizzo @JoeGruters And we have another person that doesn't understand that both Cuba and Venezuela started as socialists before they went communist. Talk to people that lived through it.  There is no such thing as Democratic Socialism. The countries you mentioned are not socialist countries...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LoneDryerSock @senpizzo @JoeGruters It would be best if you went back and read the bible again. I don't think you understand Jesus even a little bit.   Probably been fed the dumbed down, watered down BS version if Christianity all your life.   That would explain why you think an emoji with a mask is a good idea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a point when you have to realize nobody and nothing is more powerful than God.   Your faith should be found in Jesus Christ, not any man.   Christ will work through Men to get the job done and if one falls, he will raise up another.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree. However, I think it will be more of a shift back to pre-V2 and lots of fighting within the Church. I also don't think it will take 10 years to sort out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LoneDryerSock @senpizzo @JoeGruters Saying "love is love" makes love pretty much meaningless. It's not a definition or a phrase that even make coherent sense. It's a brainwashing phrase to allow sin to run rampant in this world against God and nature.  I won't even get started on the last things. Not enough time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LoneDryerSock @senpizzo @JoeGruters And you are also a socialist. If you prefer these policies, there are countries like Cuba and Venezuela ready to accept you into their socialist BS.   The government has two main duties:  Provide Safety for all Citizens Follow and enforce the constitution<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senpizzo @JoeGruters Yes, you are a socialist and a part of the problem in our country.  You don't belong in the Florida Senate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope they try. When they get caught, they will end up in jail and with high fines as it's illegal to move to a state simply to vote.  Might not matter much once they discover all the ballots Dems decides to hide in each county throughout GA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that's a big fat lie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>COWARDS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SammiG0203 Exactly. Anybody that thinks this guy founded Q is a complete moron.  How is a group of less than 10 one guy anyway?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is what a RINO looks like. He's controlled by the DS dems and he's a coward.  Truth will prevail and Mike Shirkey will be assigned an inmate number soon enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whether that's the reason or not, it's a good reason since it's a massive lie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Prayers for you Lin. Us Patriots are here for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go ahead, take Trump down right after he tweets about a storm that is coming...  See what happens.  This movie is getting really good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And so it starts in CA. This will blossom into a beautiful red flower very soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobbersonJon AMEN!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kinda like when Obama/Biden stopped testing with H1N1.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who cares? He can go wherever he wants the NBA is still dead and has done nothing to recover what they have lost.   I don't care if they swap players and it's literally pro-Trump players against liberal Chinese paid for players, I still won't watch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's amazing and doesn't even account for those of us that prayed, but didn't tell you we did.  Prayer is powerful and I guarantee more than 138 of us prayed for Washington State because I was one of them that didn't tell you, but did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They can all shove everything up their A**. These are not experts. These are power-hungry puppets looking to control people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@i8mypaint @angel28kc No idea. I'm not God and you are speaking about an incredibly rare scenario.  I don't play the "let's make the rule based on the less than 1% of cases."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Resign you criminal psycho. that's the tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Keep em comin!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1PatriotForLife Right there with you. I spend more time in Twatter jail than out these days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope. Biden isn't a Catholic anything. He's a Satanist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1PatriotForLife nope. No reason to vaccinate for something that 99.999999997% of people recover from.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The NBA is dead, so he won't have a job for very long.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good. More Catholic Leaders should follow this example.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angel28kc I think there are 2 genders and we should be aware of them: Male and Female.  You are born with a penis or a vagina and it corresponds to your gender, no matter how you "feel" or what you do to your body.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaylorRMarshall @kennedyhall Well played!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And we have more unconstitutional BS.   Stand up, #FightBack Don't give in to this BS and if they fine you, get a lawyer immediately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the best thing I have seen in a long time.  We need to go back to the days of metal playground equipment, climbing trees, scraping elbows, and crying when we lose because it hurts.  Pain is an important part of life!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's just proof the media is brainwashing people. Some get fooled immediately and others have to hear the message a few hundred times.  It's sad. Very sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's time to stand up to the Government. WE THE PEOPLE are in CHARGE, not faux-dictator governors and mayors.  EVERY Police officer in a city being told to stand down by a Mayor during riots and being told to enforce COVID restrictions should tell the Mayor to PHUCK OFF!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time for people in Philly to tell the government to Phuck OFF!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This should come as no surprise to anybody.  Been saying this would happen since June.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I said a BQQM, a BQQM, a BQQM, BQQM, BQQM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just like libtards. Always wanting things for free.  These are the idiots that if you tried to teach them to fish, they would say, "Can't you just go buy me already cooked fish to eat from a restaurant?"   They wouldn't even want to cook it themselves!  Entitled &amp; Lazy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That would be AMAZING!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Full refunds for bogus degrees that do nothing for anybody except make them more liberal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@agenda212030 I woke up around Easter when I realized it was basically the flu.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is nothing attractive about seeing a man put on a dress. It's sick, disgusting, sinful, and depraved.  Any woman finding this attractive should have their head examined immediately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>👇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I won't be canceling anything. If my family isn't on board with that, I will have my own Thanksgiving and Christmas without masks and with plenty of fun and cheer.   Those willing to be a part of it will always be welcome to join.  The fearful can stay in their own homes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1PatriotForLife I could only get rid of the blue part of a state. Too many states are very red except for a specific area where the evil happens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's no "What if" here. They are certainly using the flu to scare brainwashed Americans into thinking the boogie monster is around every corner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MilenaRodban Gotta block you because I don't surround myself with morons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Veteran1Unknown Notice the "k" on magick...this is one evil person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dictator Whitmer shutting down over the flu. It's literally the flu this time or the flu has disappeared.   It's certainly not serious enough for this BS.   Bet her husband can do whatever he wants, tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I spend less time out of twatter jail these days than in it. Been out maybe 6 hours and already back in for another 12.  They pull this new shit where they tell you only your followers will see what you say.   I am not calling my followers morons. I am calling morons morons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Phuck off with your censoring nonsense @jack You and your @TwitterSupport bs of constantly making sure only my follower can see what I say because I choose to call someone a moron or I believe HRC belongs in jail goes against my 1st amendment rights.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fire the corrupt mayors and governors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1PatriotForLife Lying and evil<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Veteran1Unknown So, if you die, there is a high probability they will blame covid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now lock them up and leave them locked up. None of this letting them out next day bs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrairieWinds10 Yep. I unfollowed him a while back, refollowed, and once again had to unfollow because he simply doesn't get it.   He still thinks Trump should wave a magic wand and fix every problem immediately like there's no local government or state government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you look at the CDC, it's pretty simple...  6% of the total deaths are from COVID and nothing else making it less than an average flu season.  94% have an average of 2.5 comorbidities and die WITH Covid, not of Covid or are simply marked as a Covid Death for the $$<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Out of those 1,300, I bet 1,000 were over the age of 80 and had 2+ comorbidities and really died WITH Covid or were marked at covid deaths for $$  Another 150-200 were probably under 80, but fit the same criteria.  Maybe 100 people, maybe actually died of COVID and just covid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Find this guy and let's make sure this demon ends up in jail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These dumbasses have their faces on camera. Let's find them and arrest them already!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Including the Mayors and Governors that support them and enable them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All you have to do is look at the dude's sign and it's pretty clear he doesn't know God.   Maybe he means god and he has a different god and he's not referring to Jesus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope. Americans must stop listing to blowhard idiots like this guy.   Many wolves in sheep's clothing out there and this is certainly one of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good thing Biden won't be president ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Twatter has censored me for calling someone a moron.   This is twice today. So now my followers are the only ones that can see what I say for 24 hours.  Are liberals such pansies they are offended by being called morons?  Get over it. Grow a pair. Stop being Morons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you live in Chicago, it's time to give a big middle finger to your psycho mayor.  Rules for thee, but not for me. She's a joke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's get that down to less than 10%. There will always be stupid sheep, but we need even less of them now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Joe Biden Secret Phone call - if this goes viral it is game over  https://t.co/Cld0uAYmta<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No I am not. It's time to run these fools out of government and into prison.  I have a feeling many, many governors and mayors are going to get used to the color Orange very soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The second they get violent, they should all be arrested and thrown in jail with no bail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, is Cuomo saying he didn't flat out say he wasn't going to allow people in New York to have the vaccine?? That's funny considering this:    https://t.co/ZMjpqJgNIK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1PatriotForLife Every single person on Mainstream Media channels<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is exactly the type of BS the fake news puppets report.  Trump did not say this. Liesten to the words from his mouth.  The blame belongs solely on Cuomo and he is the on refusing the vaccine.   It is all lies and spin from MSM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JvittalTV You should report the truth not spin you puppet. Report what he said and place the blame on Cuomo where it belongs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Close. MI isn't blue. It's under investigation, at best. ME and NE were splits, AK is red and so is NC.  I have serious questions about CA, NM, MN, NY, and VA, too. Bet at the very least, one of those "blue" states ends up flipping due to an audit or fr aud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope he is a Satanist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fisherofmeh Grandpa Sniffs Alot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>China and other countries where he can have products made for pennies. Then, he turns around and sells shitty products back to us for a massive profit.  I used to like the guy, but his true colors came through this year. This China Puppet should never be listened to again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cuban is a China Puppet just like Biden.  While I have no problem with giving money to foodbanks, Getting these 2 Republican Senate seats is VITAL to our country's wellbeing  You know who doesn't give a shit about America - Mark Cuban  He outsources as much as possible to...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>No, Biden is the National Security Risk. Get it right Politico, you know the truth.  Bet ALL of those 150 officials have dirt they don't want getting out and will end up in prison.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Magril2 @S_u_n_n_y______ @jaehhan @donaldherring11 My guess, due to the recount in Orange County, CA and a candidate out there calling for other recounts done by hand, this spreads much further.

<|startoftext|>Is @MarkHalperin a transplant from CNN?  Seriously, the dude talks like Biden is already the President.  Worst analyst allowed on @newsmax.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>His fake Hollywood guns won't do him much good if he comes after Patriots.  He might look good carrying it on screen, but deep down he's a child molesting pussy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I already know this won't happen because Biden won't be president, but if it did, I would be a part of District 12 until the resistance was formed and ready to attack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If she quit, it would be a HUGE blessing for this world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My own Dem dad still thinks Trump supporters are just Russian bots.   These people are brainwashed. That was the entire point of mainstream media and most TV/movies. They parrot what they are told, pretty close to word for word.   It's rather pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if it went to a civil war, there would be people gunning for her head on a stick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She keeps showing what they really want. They want ALL the power so they can move their communist BS into this country.  If this psycho thinks she won't be a massive target if the gets her way, she's dumber than I already thought she was.   It won't get this far, but...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden won't be president, but if he was and did this, I would be happy to join millions of others as we BURN masks in the streets and tell Biden to go F himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@catturd2 @RealCatturd2 Done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely insane. I truly hope this is the last party Bill, Joe, and Chuck get to enjoy before they spend the rest of their lives in prison as some guy's b*t*h.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's like dealing with toddlers.   They got the toy they threw a temper tantrum over and are currently quelled.   Just wait until we take that toy away.  The whole "unity" BS they are promoting will go out the window and they will be back to SEVERE HATE again!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@friknwikid Watch his followers drop like a rock. He has been wrong quite a few times over the past few months anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>MSM tried to claim Melania was telling the President to concede.   Have we all figure out that MSM simply lies, lies, lies, yet??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMontague I TRULY hope you are elected one day soon...maybe in a special election. You belong in Congress!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaesarHadrian Hmmmm...86 followers and not from the US. Probably a bot so BLOCK!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaesarHadrian And you just believed and obvious lie. You need far better sources.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaesarHadrian Sure did. The man took on the mob and won. He cleaned up NYC and he is still one of the Most Intelligent Attorneys in our country.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You mean God called a lid?? LOVE IT!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If @JoeBiden truly wanted unity, he would have joined with @realDonaldTrump to fight the v o t e r f r a u d to ensure the election was fair.   Did he do that, no? He knew Dems would cheat and he knew that was why he could stay in the basement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drjanetta Probably not true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This seems to be rather common. Dad or Mom or both start a wonderful company with a great mission. Then, the kids eventually take it over and ruin it.   Maybe spoiled little brats should actually have to earn something before they are handed the keys.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Which means it should be investigated very deeply.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ighaworth @realDonaldTrump You are just not good at this. You forgot both MI and WI.  Don't discount the fact that states you think are decided could also show up on the fraud map, too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This will come here if Biden makes it into office. Might take a few years, but make no mistake, they will Persecute Christians hard.  It will start with forcing us to fund abortion and move into lockdowns. After a while, it will become criminal.  #GodWins and #TrumpAlreadyWon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's time for @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity and any others worth watching on Fox News find a new place to call home.  @newsmax and @OANN are my first votes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamsonStrong11 He already put everything in motion that was necessary and was ready to relax for a few hours.  He knows what's about to happen &amp; already knew all of these things would happen.  Might not have known everything perfectly, but he knew enough.  Plus he knew it would drive libs nuts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1PatriotForLife YES.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@minespatch @DarnelSugarfoo @JuliansRum You probably have to say both hammer and vote in the same tweet. Just a guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarnelSugarfoo So when I vote for my favorite type of hammer, which happens to be a Craftsman like the one I own, I get told my claim is false now. Interesting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ighaworth @realDailyWire This isn't true reporting. AZ isn't called, MI and WI will go to recounts, GA isn't called, there are problems in NM, PA is a mess and I am sure there are other states we think are called that also have issues.  Biden does not have 279.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelRGallas He won't be president of anything other than is basement. I will give him a chance on his basement and on his basement only.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog &amp; @michaeljknowles can we all start calling dems and libs by their proper name??  PHARISEES!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will Democrats and Liberals just admit they are the most hypocritical people on earth?  Will you all go ahead and accept your new title?  YOU ARE ALL PHARISEES!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somebody explain why when we get pissed because athletes knee for the American Flag we are called fools and chastised?  Yet, those same people are waving American Flags at a celebration for Biden, a socialist/communist who thinks he's going to be President of the United States.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@suburban_woman And it's not over in any of the, along with Nevada and Arizona, which they have already called, too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MittRomney is a puppet of the Left. Putting an (R) next to his name should be a crime.  Bet he's featured on a hard drive or laptop. Can't wait till he's in an orange jumpsuit.  TRAITOR!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We already know this guy is a RINO. He's a part of the DEEP STATE and proves it daily now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh you idiots that believe Mainstream Media has any power to call an election.   Please, for the Love of God, study Bush v. Gore.   This isn't new and the election isn't decided. It will be decided when the Electoral College votes in December.  This is Government 101 folks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's time to PRAY, take action, and continue to trust God. It's not time to believe the Mainstream Media idiots and social media morons.  Elections are decides by the states and the legislature, NOT the Legacy Media Morons.   Bush v. Gore had headlines stating Gore was Pres. FYI.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never will. Media diesn't decide elections.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>called for Bush. Even in 2016, most of us conservatives didn't believe Trump was actually elected until the Electoral College voted and 7 didn't vote the way they were supposed to based on the election.  Educate yourselves #Dems and #Liberals, the show is just beginning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you #votedforBiden and you think he actually won because NBC, ABC, CBS, Politico, AP, and other MSM propaganda machines told you he won, you don't understand how elections work at all.  I urge you to study Bush v. Gore from 2000 and figure out when that election was...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Art of War.  Look weakest when you're strongest.  Biden announcement coming today and the minute it leaves Joe's puppet mouth, floodgates open.  Mass Fraud will be brought to light.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Understand, the MSM is trying to make @realDonaldTrump Look very weak. They are trying to make his weak position even weaker by making this fake announcement.  Media doesn't decide the Presidency. If you honked your horn for #Biden, you need to wake up. It's not over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#WonByAlot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>About 47 more counties in MI and around another dozen states. Probably more than 2 million votes total across the nation, maybe more.  "Glitch" in GA too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Investigators are gonna be very busy. They will be needed in several states as more fraud is uncovered.  Trump won very big and they will prove it. Biden's vote count is inflated in all 50 states.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The @dnc knows they are caught. They are trying everything to gain power. Time to start arresting these criminals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GerhardLandrat So you've never read the bible, huh? Some prettu crazy shit in there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have the same question.  Seems like the hate for Trump is what runs the lives of many liberals. It's rather sick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Idonttwit @BradStoney1776 Keep believing PolitiFact. They put fact in their name and constantly lie.   You are being so mislead and you probably won't ever see it.   Enjoy the shock when you find out how wrong you are about pretty much everything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd say this is rather relevant. Time for a new, secure voting system in ALL STATES!   https://t.co/EBYxkV13Ya<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think we should put a statue of her in all the spots where statues were torn down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I predicted it would be the momma bears saving our country months ago. Wonder how many of the lawyers working for Trump right now are pissed-off moms fighting for our country?!?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. These are Millionaires waiting for other people to bring them the story. They are NOT Journalists. They are public relation puppets for the Dems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>EXACTLY!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@try14me All brainwashed liberals thinking Biden is an eloquent speaker.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emabrams Come after us. See what happens you corrupt criminal demons.   Bring it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Toddlers will act like toddlers. If they had nothing to hide, they wouldn't be pulling this kind of shit.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@indynewsmedia Wonder which laptop Keith will be featured on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@qs_anon @BreitbartNews That's fine. I hate Satan's demons and she is clearly one of them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Dimensionally_ @HYVEE7 @cjtruth @M2Madness @VincentCrypt46 @robbystarbuck @RealCandaceO @intheMatrixxx @MajorPatriot These people are idiots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So they are working on filling out another 19,000 ballots for Biden??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dantheman8019 @external_she So these legal votes should be counted and Trumps lead should go way up, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope. Maybe 55 million. Even 60 is pushing it.  At least 10 million are illegal aliens. Another 5 million or so are dead people. Probably another 5 million are simply people that don't even exist.  Not to mention the 5 million or so Trump votes they simply lost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, it should start with MSM not calling CA, OR, and WA within seconds of the polls closing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GloriaAmes4 True lol, but it would keep them from bring in pens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good theory and I agree, I think something similar to this could happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CogswellWilliam So you're coming out as a RINO then. That begs the questions...  Which laptop will we find you on??  We know how this game is played. You are not a Republican and now we know why you won in a Blue District.  RINO RINO RINO RINO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Joe is a candidate for PRESIDENT and he thinks we are a Democracy. That's pathetic.  CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonShaw2017 @titus_carpathia @TeresaBumgarne1 Doesn't even need to be in all states, either. For example, in FL, we have pretty secure voting and it would have been hard to fake ballots here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If they counted legal ballots, he'd be ahead in the popular vote by about 10 million too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1PatriotForLife 5 million were dead. 10 million were illegal aliens. 2.5 million were changed votes.  There were probably a few million Trump votes dumped, too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's time to open the flood gates and start the arrests. Guarantee when indictments are unsealed 90% of ALL (both parties) politicians in DC will go down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Julia_NC_910 Those ballots would be counted in minutes in a state with Voter ID, signature verify and a legit system like Florida.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do It Trump Supporters. Start making calls and RETWEET THIS LIKE CRAZY!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you live in #Michigan #Wisconsin #NorthCarolina #NC #Pennsylvania #Arizona #Nevada #Georgia it is time to MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD!!!!  CALL your State Reps (State house and senate) Until they Do THEIR JOB about this Election Fraud!!!  CALL, CALL, CALL, CALL Blow them up!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mdgeek2 Won't happen. Patience. Good will come out of this and it doesn't matter what the MSM says. They are only a public relations firm for the Dems anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mdgeek2 Me either. I get it. There are plenty of RINOS out there, but don't worry, they are gonna get wrapped up in some shit, too.   I am guessing about 90% of DC goes down by next summer, but that's just my guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DizzoTha @QueenBee2269 Correct. He probably hasn't slept more than 4 hours a night for over a week now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mdgeek2 Patience and turn off any mainstream media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mdgeek2 And go where?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Aren't YOU the journalist??  Isn't it YOUR job to investigate amd SHOW us??  Are you mad b/c we are doing your job better than you??  It's not hard to find. Videos everywhere. States/counties showing more votes than registered voters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How about all votes across the entire country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1PatriotForLife Yea, they called the entire west coast 3 seconds before the polls were even closed. They were calling the northeastern states for Biden with 3 to 5% of the vote counted.  The map they used mimics 2016 &amp; they chose battleground states based on where they were cheating the most.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you look at votes on a state and county level we have the biggest turnout in history. Some had more than 100% of the registered voters show up and vote.  This doesn't pass the smell, eye, touch, taste, or hear test.  It's fraud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It will always be more than they thought until Biden is ahead, then there will be no more ballots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All #Catholics please read.  All #Christians please read.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just saw it for myself. Something is very fishy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This should be the BIG NEWS, but nobody is talking about it.   It's considered amazing to get 80% of registered voters to show up, but when you get more than 100%, that's called fraud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Agent4MAGA Her name was Christina. That's all I know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gramma_Nini @realDonaldTrump I am watching Newsmax and never saw it. Wondering if it got moved to a different time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Agent4MAGA Can't stand the female contributor on Newsmax (obviously Dem) calling Rudy a Russian asset. It's weak and pathetic. Newsmax can do better than that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know @newsmax is trying to be bipartisan and I appreciate that, but a contributor is ripping @realDonaldTrump and referring to @RudyGiuliani as a Russian asset.   Are you kidding me? Seriously, you won't win much credibility with contributors like her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a very interesting theory. I hope it's true and I could certainly see the validity in it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jdburney1 I hope this is true. I can see it for sure for a few reasons.   1. Already showing more votes in some states than registered voters 2. There is no way more people actually wanted to vote for Biden compared to HRC. 3. Trump is surrounded by geniuses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought the same thing when I saw it. This is faked. There is no way that many people show up in the exact same car. Complete BS.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Not to mention he can't open his snake-like mouth without lying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not a chance. I would wait all day, call the hotline for the area and get this changed immediately.  Many areas trying to say their machines are done. Tell them you will wait until they are working again and watch as they magically work a few minutes later.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay you Democrat Turds, THIS is actual voter suppression.   Long lines ARE NOT voter suppression as you like to say it is.  However, THIS IS!   Learn what you're saying before you say it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tyra_favara For some, it's the only day they are given off from work to vote. Employers are required to give them time to vote and many choose election day.  Some don't trust early voting, too.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I have amended my map. This is my final prediction. I now think NY will go red and I have VA as a toss up. Trump is gonna win big.   #TRUMP2020Landside    https://t.co/zbGM1kQx5H<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And they still couldn't top 50K views online. At the same time, the Trump rally was at nearly 200K online viewers.  Trumps rally was packed.  Biden's with Hollywood people, I've seen more people show up for a good local band in the park.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's funny is Trump probably won't even be there tomorrow. He will be well protected elsewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The house won't get that decision. Trump will seal it tomorrow night because this one isn't gonna be close folks.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NurseAnon1 I keep thinking, if We The People know all this about their plan, how much more does Trump's team know?  At this point, I have to believe Trump is already way ahead of anything they have planned and it will not end well for them.  Maybe some riots. Maybe some tricks, but #GodWins<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And just like during this little crime, they are about to fall flat on their face.  People stealing political signs are complete dumbasses and deserve to faceplant like this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here you go Patriots, time to flip another poll and piss off some liberals that don't understand what happens when EVERYBODY votes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@votereyedee ish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes and it's barely Biden's home state.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump with not only week all 8 of these states, but he will do it in big fashion.  Guarantee if this is what Real Clear Politics is willing to promote, you can add 4 to 8 more points to each of these in favor of Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds like they PAID people to vote. I bet this is illegal.  Also heard Lebron is going to be featured on the Hunter Laptop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KimJKerby 50/50 on internet/social media. Don't think electricity will go down tho.  Might only go down in specific areas, too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not a single one of these outlets is unbiased at all. If you want the truth you want @OANN.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fake names and fake numbers.  Names of democratic voters only.  Or just a big FU, come and try to make me follow your BS policies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least 70 more than this prediction. I think Trump gets 400.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That's good, but it's gonna be closer to 400.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonJimmyMario @Lynlee2813 Maybe maybe not, but it wouldn't surprise me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Goooooood riddance. Go to China and never come back you spoiled brats.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Always plagiarizing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you #democrats and #liberals so driven by hate you will actually vote for a Criminal Suspect on Tuesday?  Maybe you haven't heard yet.   If you plan to #VoteForBiden, you should be informed and know what's going on before you fill in the circle for #BidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gey_Toad  https://t.co/lp4DMNmJM8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, Hilary would not have handled it better because it would have never happened. We would have already been well on our way to a country ruled by communism and they would not have had to unleash COVID.  It's really about time to arrest the entire Criminal Clinton Family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely hate it. It's not necessary and one of the dumbest things we are all forced to do twice per year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plus the CDC has updated those number twice and only about 6% were actually deaths FROM COVID.  Big difference between a death FROM COVID and a death from comorbidities for patients WITH COVID.  Hospitals are getting paid more $$ for each COVID death, too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A #VoteForBiden is like deciding you'd like your job to go to China, Mexico, or another country.  Think before you vote on Tuesday. If you plan to vote for #Biden you can choose to vote for Trump instead or JUST STAY HOME!  Please watch before you vote #liberals, #democrats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope tissues are available because these liberal idiots are gonna need them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This will not go well for them. It will be a huge waste of time and money when Trump wins by such a margin they can't do a damn thing about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Screw this psycho bitch. I would refuse id I owned a Bar or Restaurant in MI. Better yet, I would provide the worst fake names with fake phone #s.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KellyBu81471167 Oh yes, of course, always better to be prepared for the worst possible outcome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I were a bar or restaurant owner I would be telling this psycho sorta woman to shove it up her ass.  I would never collect names and phone numbers of my customers for the purpose of the government. That's not what we do here in FREE America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You watch. When Trump is re-elected many of these numbers will go much, much lower. Income tax belongs at 0.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lites_john That is what we refer to as a CINO. No true Catholic supports abortion or birth control because they know it's a problem when humans try to take the place of God.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@qs_anon You watch. When Trump gets re-elected it will happen before Christmas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another great reason to #VoteForTrump2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@votereyedee Needle in a haystack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatWebheart Dig deeper. Maybe you'll figure out why.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Truth!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's coming will not be stopped. Be prepared, be ready, it's right around the corner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a movie we are watching.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's way bigger than that. They are starting to lean Trump because the last thing they want to do is be as wrong as they were in 2016.   Trump probably leads by 8 to 10 points here in FL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's my map for Tuesday. I have 3 Toss-up states that I truly believe will turn Red, if voter fraud is quelled. All 50 Red would not surprise me, however.   https://t.co/KPsv3nP2Gj #2020election<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wonderful! His parents must be instilling good values in him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>100% truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ummm....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reason number 8,934,546,323,245 not to vote for Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rob1990J @TweetleDuh13 @AnnieGrayerCNN Probably just responded to a bot, anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rob1990J @TweetleDuh13 @AnnieGrayerCNN How? Look it up. Nobody is keeping these people from voting because they have to wait to VOTE EARLY.  Now, on election day, if they turn them away, that is voter suppression, but today, days early, no, waiting in line is NOT voter suppression.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If any of these celebs touted the "Defund the Police" BS, the armed guards should quit immediately.   Celebs best spend their $$ wisely as Pedowood is gonna come crashing down and many will either be in jail or out of a job when it happens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What have I learned today?   I have learned that liberals have no idea what voter suppression is. They think if you have to wait in line, it's voter suppression.  Complete MORONS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrunoAmato_1 @AnnieGrayerCNN @5thding66 Waiting in line is NOT voter suppression. These people are NOT being kept from voting. They have to wait because a lot of people want to vote early.   It's not voter suppression until they are told they can't vote. Big difference.   https://t.co/7uAA0scmoq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DenRigtigeNabil @AnnieGrayerCNN @mehdirhasan Ask the idiots that decided early voting made sense. In my state it didn't start until 2004.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who you talking to Obama? Nobody showed up for your ridiculous performance.   CLOWN SHOW!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is just proof that 99% of Colleges and Universities need a complete overhaul.   They are liberal bootcamps, not higher education facilities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This seems to at least really bend the laws around what you can do at a polling station.  I guess when you're desperate, you gotta pull out all the dirty tricks possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will the Lemon laptops be the next place child porn is found??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This makes a person wonder what @donlemon has done. Is he going to be featured on the Hunter Biden Laptop? The Weiner Laptop?   Maybe something completely different will come out about him, but the only people I've ever heard feel sorry for pedophiles are other pedophiles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So a $20 discount on parking tickets is helping those facing economic hardship.  This has got to be the stupidest thing that has been said in all of 2020 and that's saying something.   What a dolt!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>CNN allowed this???   https://t.co/KFnrKbuPhI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How'd this get past the editors??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So true lol.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Good. They are actually doing what they should do then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottThuman Instead of plywood for the windows, how about arming yourself and guarding your buildings? Maybe a few paintball guns to start with real guns as backups.  Get hit with a barrage of frozen paintballs or pepper balls and they will back off fast.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This certainly sounds like a threat to me. Why is this drunk hag still allowed to speak and roam free??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>did they finally fact check him and discover every word out of his mouth is a lie?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheConlee @KamalaHarris This is pathetic. It looks like a gathering of people for something they really don't want to see or hear.   Trump rallies are energetic HOURS before he arrives. Been there and this looks less than sad in comparison.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is he doing the thing leftists do and making up words?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bernie Sanders should move to Russia and disappear from our lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay. Now do H1N1.  This sounds a lot like Dems panicking as they have to because they are all about to lose power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here we go Florida. Catch all these fools and toss them in jail where they belong. Let's stop the Voter Fraud!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PeterWallaceAU He would call this Priest a brood of vipers or something else biblical and baptize the baby himself. Then, he would forgive the parents for being roped into this stunt after they repented.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would never allow this with my children. Do it right or I will go find a Priest that will.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope! Never!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this linked to the article stating 61 people had viewed the document about it?  I remember they were supposed to storm the WH in Sept. too.  Then there was the million person march that turned into a few thousand, at most.  Small amount of ppl being very loud.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Recook63Russell I agree. I think we'd be lucky if 10% were left once things go down. Heck HRC said if she goes down, she will take half of DC with her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree. Some were saying Trump would easily win this election if he got double digits with the Black vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Snopes is literally the trash can of the internet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CuriousCamo Biden isn't up. Even in his own dreams he's way behind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These people are lunatics. Are they going to call for the impeachment of the other 4, maybe 5, Justices that will also vote the same way?  Liberals are no longer liberal, they are Communist psychos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alliemarie777 @JerseyGirlDeni Start arresting them when they break things and set bail at $1 million and this all stops fast.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EwallWice @CBSNews @BarackObama @JoeBiden How about some questions to Biden about this??   https://t.co/ZkM42oWQsg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So they should all do their jobs, and then go vote for Trump so they still have jobs to do. Cowards don't stand up to bullies. Puppets do as thier handlers tell them to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh how perfect!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danielchaitin7 @reallavamom I'd say this specific journalism is gonna be in jail when the Biden family goes down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BouvLind Nope. Its going red due to evil dems being brought into the light.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrumperWavin @Kayrosis I agree. VA could go red and I think Mass. Is up for grabs too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really, another governor is gonna play this game? What happened with the other one?   Bet this was BLM and Antifa acting at Trump supporters too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's time for the IRS to no longer exist. Income tax is unconstitutional and many don't even know it. The first time income tax was even used wasn't until the early 1900s under the Corporation of the USA not the Constitutional Republic of the USA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How about instead we eliminate these four America Haters from public office?  If you voted for any of these idiots, you really need to re-evaluate everything you believe or move to a new country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is anybody there to see this clown or are all those circles filled with journalists and bloggers?  I count 35 circles, so maybe there's a total of 50 or so. Even if you had one family of 4 per circle, that's only 200 people and there are several circles with 1 person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If anybody still thinks this guy should be President, they are either brainwashed or too stupid to be voting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The consequences are you and your dumbass socialist party are done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, that's because she's going to Jail soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's time for Chuckie to go. What a puppet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If this is accurate based on Early Voting it spells panic for Dems. Many Conservatives wait for election day and many cannot get any other day off from WORK to vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We need to return to a system where income tax is illegal and those that want to lovingly give to projects in other countries can do so.   Taxing American Citizens to pay for foreign projects is robbery.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While I am not a fan, All are welcome. Rappers, Priests, Average Joes, it doesn't matter. All are welcome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Use camo guys. There are ways to get the word out and not get censored.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's because masks don't work. They were made for bacteria and pollution, not viruses.  Plus, wearing a mask hurts the immune system and I bet a large amount of those 52K cases are the common cold, the flu, or ppl with no symptoms that have been convinced they are sick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How about we stop worrying about the spread since the curve was flattened many months ago and it has a 99.997% survival rate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>they are roped into doing the bidding of the parents. Many think Joe is at the top of this very corrupt family. I don't. I think it's Jill and she is just at the top of THIS Family.  It goes higher to Obama and past.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>been verified. None of this even includes the financial schemes, which lead directly to Joe or the diary showing Joe did inappropriate things with his daughter.   These people are very sick. They don't look at their children like normal parents do. The children are victims and<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>they trying to forget or escape from? Hunter has been caught on camera with very young (maybe underage) girls, he slept with his brother's widow, and he got a stripper pregnant.  It's not a far stretch to think he did plenty of other things and some of those other things have...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most of it has already been verified and they are working on verifying more. My own eyes have seen enough to know (video/image) there are massive problems with the Biden Family.  Two children struggle with drugs. It's not funny, but why do they struggle with drugs? What are...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BroStreetJoy Guardian Angels will be and are already working overtime.   Pray, pray, pray.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is simply brilliant!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. These types of events are happening everywhere and have been for months.  The Boat Parade as been broken at least twice and every Saturday and Sunday videos/images from these types of rallies take over Twatter.  If Journalist paid attention and reported truth, we'd all know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Starbucks can take their burnt coffee and give themselves an enema with it.

<|startoftext|>Okay, so has anybody else noticed this new trick from Twatter. If you're Conservative and you post a comment on a post from a Democrat, instead of your comment going in the order, at the top, it quickly falls to the bottom and gets lost.  Just saw it happen. That explains a lot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You just attacked nuns. Are you really this low?  Why are all you brainwashed fools so quit to choose masks over your own personal freedoms?  Do you realize masks were never designed for viruses, but for bacteria and pollution?  Always with the bullying from the left. Toddlers.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Also includes the flu and common cold. Tests pick up both as COVID.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Plus those are symptoms of wearing a mask.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GR8Mel8 I agree with you. I have never seen so many people fall victim to the demon of Hate in my life.   Most of them can't come up with a good reason to hate him either. They just say, "oh, I don't like his tweets or he's narcissistic."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BVMConsolatrix I've been praying we'd have clergy willing to go to prison for Christ. That was the biggest disappointment.

<|startoftext|>@CuriousRabitt @Frying_Machine It might depend on when they received the photos &amp; what they did with them. I would guess they have some level of protection, but if they sat on them for months, I think they can be held complicit.  When OANN got them &amp; realized what they had, they contacted the authorities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see you mentioned the flu. So, are you saying they are counting flu cases as Covid? Seems like it, since flu cases are way down compared to the same time last year.  Do masks play a role considering they destroy your immune system?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey #Democrats, I found a good read for you...   https://t.co/Oz4tqHyfU8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's not forget the CDC showed 6% of the deaths were FROM Covid, while 94% were potentially WITH Covid, big difference.  More recently the CDC said 130K deaths were from either the flu, Pneumonia, or a heart attack, NOT COVID.  Deaths are over counted. Cases are overcounted.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>These are great questions for any #Christians out there planning to #VoteforBiden.  Last time I checked witches and Satanists don't try to cast spells on evil people.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Not even a little.   And I won't be surprised when we find out he wasn't the one at the top. I bet Jill, the Obamas, the Clintons, and a few others outranked him and called many of the shots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Billionaire before becoming President, yet the idiots on the Left want to see his taxes.  Why don't they want to see the taxes of Pelosi, Biden, Obama, and many others that somehow became multi-millionaires on a six-figure salary?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. Then they quietly adjust things to show only 6% died from Covid while 130K came from heart attack, Flu, and Pneumonia.   They know it's no worse than a flu and the tests will pick up even the common cold and call it Covid.   Huge scam.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Black Winter he bought up last night. Hmmmm...sounds like a plan from the Dems to do the other thing Joe wants, more Lockdowns.  Look at the first week of Flu season. Flu cases down 95%, yet COVID is spiking.   Wonder why??  #WakeUpAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And no, if it went to 95% 100,000 lives would not be saved. This might as well be teh BIDEN Network.  Actually, the masks weaken the immune system, so if it went to 95% more people would get the flu, which they are counting as COVID, which also means Joe would be right about the<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That means at least 51% of us understand WE are FREE in America and get to decide what's right for our own health.  If you want to wear a mask, go ahead. I won't bully you.  Just don't bully me when I say I don't &amp; don't use the BS "it's for the health of all of us" crap either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is about the third or fourth almost pro-Trump think I have heard from a CNN person in the past few days.   Are some of them waking up??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. Many people don't get Satan enough credit for how cunning he is.   Biggest con artist to ever live and has a legion of very intelligent demons as an army.  Even some Christians try to act like Satan is no big deal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree, yet I wouldn't be surprised if the head of the cartel is actually Jill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Liberals make fun of you Terrence because they'd never write their own books. They hire ghostwriters and barely even know what was written under their name.  Many are simply Puppets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only thing you screwed up here is it was Antifa and BLM, not a far-right anti-government group, but good try.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@knowlton_jon @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump I'd let Trump run it because he'd probably triple it in a week.  Biden, on the other hand, he'd sell my business to China and wrap me up in so much scandal I'd end up in Jail.  Biden can't be trusted to do much more than pick out his own ice cream flavors. Elder abuse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Democrats, #Liberals, #BidenHarris2020 voters, do these topics matter to you?  If they do (and they should) maybe it's time to figure out why you haven't heard #Biden talk about them.   Maybe it's time to figure out why these topics haven't been a part of the debates.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeLaChance33 Surprise me, no. Based on the moderator and the way it's all set up, not even a little surprised.  The American people are getting shorted by the Dems and many are catching on to it.   All the topics on your list would destroy Biden, yet he did it on his own with the Oil Industry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you weren't an idiot you'd get the polls right to begin with. It's time for a new career Frank cause you'll be completely wrong again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another little Snack for you #Democrats, #Liberals, and people planning to #VoteForBiden.  Enjoy as all the lies this man feeds you continue to fall apart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ask yourself, when was the last time CNN, MSNBC, or another MSM outlet actually showed True Video Evidence of Trump Lying?   Not a cut off clip without the entire quote.  Actual Irrefutable Video Evidence He Lied.  Bet you can't find one instance, yet I can find dozens for Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He got caught again this year by both #BernieSanders and #PresidentTrump.   All #JoeBiden does is lie. This #BigGuy is a liar and if you vote for him, you are voting for a liar.   I know if you're #VotingForBiden it's not because you like him. It's because you hate #Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, guess what #Democrats, #BernieBros, #BidenHarris2020 #voters   #BIDEN LIES. All the Frikin Time. He's been lying his entire life and he keeps getting caught.  He got caught in 1987 when running for Pres.  He got caught in 2007 when running for Pres.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Once a liar always a liar huh #BigGuy   The only difference this time is he's suffering from dementia and his family belongs in jail for many crimes, including elder abuse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>products are made with Crude Oil before you go vote. You probably won't like what you find out.   If you #VoteForBiden and he ends the Oil Industry, as he promised, it won't just be millions of jobs lost.   It will eliminate around 75% of the things you use every single day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yea, it's pretty sad when the official CNN poll only had #Biden at 53% and a Twitter poll from a CNN person with nearly 200K votes had #Trump at 90%  Biden got smoked. He's done simply because he said he wants to end the Oil Industry.  #Dems you best look up what...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Tell the entire story Mark. Don't just find another way to blame Trump for something Obama/Biden started and caused.   https://t.co/8Aq6SbuOKO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@suchsmallbeauty That's true. I don't know if it's a decision from the networks or from the Trump campaign. If it's from the networks, it's election interference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@suchsmallbeauty Trump is just smart enough to know where his audience is. Most people DVR shows or mute during commercials. However, if you watch YouTube, you might see some Trump ads.   Also, I have seen them on Hulu shows, too. Trump knows where people actually watch TV.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The machinery used to strip mine the minerals used for the batteries for electric cars, wind power, and solar power use Diesel Fuel.

<|startoftext|>1.7 million jobs in the auto industry Nearly 2 million jobs at car dealerships 129,000 gas station jobs 96,000 jobs at auto parts stores And so much more.  It's not just the direct Oil &amp; Gas jobs that are impacted.  continued below...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh you heard correctly. Somehow @JoeBiden things he can replace all of the following with electric cars, new buildings, and 50,000 charging stations:  10 million Oil &amp; Gas Jobs 1 million Plastics Industry jobs 166,000 Gas Stations (many are small businesses) continued below...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@John8_58 @Lavabisme It's a valid question.  Let's not forget the LGBTQ movement stole the Rainbow Flag from the Christian Church.   It's used to mock, which is the same move Satan uses often.   God = Creator Satan = Mocker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@John8_58 Go to a Traditional Latin Mass and you'll find out where Taylor Marshall is trying to send people and why.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>- The production process for batteries in electric cars is also not eco-friendly  You might think these sources of energy are green and wonderful for the environment, but they are not.  Not to mention, wind and solar energy are both unreliable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>you have considered the following:  - It causes more damage to the environment to make a steel wind turbine than it saves. - Wind turbines not only kill a lot of birds, but they also kill a lot of bats, which eat mosquitoes. - Solar panels are not eco-friendly to make.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The 10 million jobs in the Oil &amp; Gas industry doesn't account for the 168,000 gas stations that will close, many of which are small businesses.   Sure, Biden wants to "transition" but do you realize it's not just about Oil &amp; Gas? It's about working people.  Plus, I wonder if...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>are both used to in the process of making plastic. Are you willing to give up ALL the plastic items around your home?   What about the 1 million (approx.) jobs found in the plastics industry?  Add that to the nearly 10 million jobs in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. Plus...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just curious, #Democrats, #Liberals, and those #VotingforBiden, He wants to eliminate the oil industry, we just found that out last night.  Have you connected the dots yet to realize that will have a MASSIVE impact on the Plastics Industry, too.  Crude Oil and Natural Gas...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sure did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@knowlton_jon And watching cuties. I hear that's his new fav.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden here is more proof you lied. #Democrats, #Liberals, #Dems here you go, another #Biden lie.  #Debates2020 #DebateTonight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here you go #Dems even your ppl know #Biden is lying again.  He lied in 1987, lied in 2007, and he is lying now, too.  This is just one of many lies from #JoeBiden   Enjoy #Liberals, #leftists, and #Democrats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dude, you keep promising to lock us all down again.   Do you say anything that's true, ever?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's  just called good parenting and has nothing to do with the color of one's skin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I lost my coverage. It went from 100% coverage with a low deductible and a $1,000 emergency rider for $110 per month.  The replacement option was 90% coverage with triple the deductible for more than $500 a month and no rider.  I could barely afford the $110 let alone $500.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mommarae1231 Yes, big time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And causes small businesses to cut jobs and raise prices.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, Biden wants to bail out businesses and lockdown citizens??  Who will those businesses serve if everyone is locked down?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fact check: Does Joe Biden lie??  YES. ALL THE TIME.  Here you go #dems #Biden lied again tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cause it was funneled thru his family members.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChurchCandace Is that a finger condom? lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's always a political stunt to play on the so-called compassion of people with these idiots.  Really, we all just know Democrats don't like to do their job. They'd rather throw a temper tantrum and let the adults clean up their mess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And Warner Bros. is going to go broke now. Nobody wants to watch this garbage.   Heck, if it were up to me, I'd just throw out the TV altogether and live without it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChurchCandace I am right there with ya. Been shouting it from the rooftops.  There are 2 types of #Catholics willing to #VoteforBiden  1. Fake 2. Brainwashed  Pray for both.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just becaues 10 baffoons decided to skip work doesn't mean the world stops.   Dems really do think everything revolves around them and their greedy little power grabs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NurseAnon1 Imagine that. Democrats don't want to work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. We need to get rid of Bill Gates and his cronies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why they always want to raise taxes. They want more money to launder and put into their own pockets.  There's a reason why #Trump has said multiple times, we have plenty of money (in reference to the US).  We are in debt because #crookedpoliticians have been stealing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LauraLiberty45 @OmghemanCapptec @SpeakerPelosi She also funnels taxpayer $$ through her husband and several others back into her pocket.  How else do you get to a net worth of over $100 million on a salary of $223K a year?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And at that point, you should be contacting your Senator, House Reps, and other elected officials to make them aware of this issue. Wherever this happened, you need to get those with power aware.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No surprise. Just more proof Democrats really don't like doing any work. They can't even show up and vote no.  Such partisan Chinese Puppets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@preemie513 @Marcus45128888 They will be connected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@think_4_yurself I was taught to have far more respect for myself. Plus, I don't eat soy and pretend it's meat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nobody is surprised that a self-proclaimed "god" is going to vote Dem. Seriously, why does anybody listen to someone that calls themselves a god??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChaskaDaisy @xbrtkp And they will take those jobs to another country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally, why is it their "Fair Share" when it's wealthy people? Do you realize those with more money already pay more in taxes and most people with lower incomes get most of the $$ they pay in back in the thing called a TAX RETURN?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First, when you raise taxes on those that employ people, they cut jobs and/or wages.  Second, Joe Biden is a known liar, so why should we believe him?  Third, Biden wants to get rid of the Trump Tax Cut. When you get rid of a tax cut, taxes go up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is sick. This lady belongs behind bars and NBC should be shut down for allowing this to happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is pathetic. Embarrassing.  BTW where are the circles for these people to stand in??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>100% Correct. Wouldn't be the first corrupt pope either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No surprise. Dems are big-time crybabies that claim to be all about compassion.  They are the party of:  Greed Selfishness Entitlement Crime Pedophilia China Participation Trophies<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The Pope hasn't been a bible believer for a long time.  #Catholics should have woken up to his corruption the moment he allowed Pachamamas in.   He's corrupt, probably not the real Pope, and closer to Satan than Christ.  #TheCatholicChurch is splitting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For all you #VoteforBiden people we call #Democrats, #liberals, or #leftists, that ask "What has Trump done as President?"  This thread is for you.

<|startoftext|>@BVMConsolatrix When it goes against the teachings of the Catholic church, it doesn't matter if the Pope said it or not, it's not to be followed.  Too many Catholics seem to think the words of the Pope are Gospel. They are not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>17 you say??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WontFixYourPC From what I understand, legally, they can't make a change now since people have started voting.  I could be wrong, but I believe they can't move Harris up or replace Biden at this point. They are stuck with their ticket.   Only thing they can do is push for write ins.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet you didn't walk away when they started disrespecting our flag???  Did your handlers tell you that you had to post this or did they do it for you??  Why do those with the $$ to walk away only virtue signal??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the best videos of what's really going on I have every seen.  Every #Liberal, #Democrat, #BidenHarris2020 voter, and everyone else should watch this.  #Hollywood #Entertainment #Truth    https://t.co/TkiKoE6fR1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most likely, if they think it's this close it's more like...  Trump 65% Jorgenson 10% Biden 25%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This will lead to a class action lawsuit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRealTeeTank @realDonaldTrump I get the worry. It's just a common thing these days even among conservatives where we think we should know the plan for everything.  Heck, I have my own level of worry about it. Just trying to turn that over to God every day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good. Prager U would bring some type of balance to what students are taught. Maybe with something to balance out the ridiculous liberal crap they are taught more will learn to think for themselves instead of just accept what the teacher says.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do we think we're entitled to know every plan under the sun?  If we knew the plan to deal with people after the election causing trouble, then so would they.  If @realDonaldTrump says "Don't Worry about it" that translates to, a plan is in place, but it's not yours to know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So does loving ALL people include the babies Biden wants to kill through Abortion and infanticide.  Why are you bragging about your skills as rationale for voting for Biden?

<|startoftext|>@here_comes_B Maybe. Not saying for sure, but could. Based on the fact that NY, as a state is very red, except the NYC area, it could.   I think the riots and the issues in the streets there could have driven enough dems elsewhere or away from their party. Again, it's a maybe, but could.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@luis593547 @sgaspari @UF4joe @AirBossUT5 Really? I was just at one with about 20K other people out in the middle of nowhere. I'd say there are plenty of people that care about them.   Look at the views on YouTube and tell me people don't care about the rallies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sgaspari @luis593547 @UF4joe @AirBossUT5 Biden is desperate and has to spend since he never comes out of the basement except to get the occasional ice cream cone.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@luis593547 There is absolutely no love or compassion in killing an innocent life to spare the adult from a hardship or obstacle in life. It's murdering a human being that wasn't even given a chance to spare one that was of an obstacle in life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luis593547 Welfare is the church's job not the job of govt. Govt welfare is forced charity thru taxation, which isn't love or compassion. It's theft. When the churches handle it those giving are freely choosing to give. That's love and compassion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Phoenix_Fulcrum @AirBossUT5 All 3 are already very red except for counties around the big cities. The big cities experienced the majority of the riots, mainly NYC, Chicago, and LA. I think the riots will cause many to rethink voting for Dems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luis593547 @sgaspari @UF4joe @AirBossUT5 From what I've seen they arent pulling out of any states. Huge team holding rallies all over the country. Trump isn't the only one traveling all over the place holding rallies.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Not impossible. If you're paying attention you know voter fraud is real and widespread. Heck, people have been arrested and prosecuted in multiple states for voter fraud over the last few months.  CA is one of the worst states for it. Assuming this might be sarcasm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AirBossUT5 This is just the beginning. I bet Trump breaks 350 and breaks 70 million.  We haven't even begun in FL and it will be super red down here. CA or NY could turn red or at the very lease less blue and IL might be up for grabs too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Truth!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You're making things worse you paid puppet.  You cry racism, yet you're the racist.   Maybe you should use your platform for good instead of the work of the devil.  Of course, we already know who owns your soul.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These people are lunatics. Every person watching and cheering this on should be arrested and sentenced to a minimum of 1 year in jail.   When Trump gets elected again, this shit will end real fast.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is what a lunatic looks like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is an interesting theory. I'd probably be okay with it as long as Hunter and the rest of the coherent Biden family go to Jail for their crimes, including elder abuse.  Joe probably belongs in a nursing home. He's obviously on the way down mentally.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@zeeshan_A16 What case? Covid has similar symtoms to the flu, it's spread similarly, and has an inflated, similar death rate.  If you did proper research, you'd know the CDC has stated 6% of the deaths came from COVID,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelTopitz Whether he's a strawman or not, Biden is a criminal, along with his entire family. He also belongs in a nursing home, not running for president.  Trump will win PA.

<|startoftext|>@kmax2go 6% of the total deaths were actually from COVID-19. The other 94% had an average of 2.5 comorbidities.   This means, about 12k to 13k actually died from Covid.  The other 94% died WITH Covid, another BIG maybe since car/motorcycle accident victims were marked as Covid deaths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kmax2go You should look up the amount of deaths in the United States for 2018 and 2019. Compare them to this year with average predictions for the rest of the year. It might open your eyes, maybe.  It's also important to revisit the CDC website to find out that...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WHFakeNews @GOP Maybe it's time to find a way to let go of the hate. I am not saying you need to like or even vote for Trump, but let go of the hate, it's destroying your ability to reason.   Look it up, that's what hate does. It destroys reasoning abilities in your brain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WHFakeNews @GOP Your statement makes no sense. The virus came from China and many military intelligence agencies have agreed it was likely a form of biological warfare.

<|startoftext|>@lifetothemax1 How many died? Do they ever get the flu? Are humans allowed to be human in the White House?  Why do you hate Trump so much?

<|startoftext|>@code_ferret You're wishful thinking is not only horrific, but also shows how hate is running your life.  Let go of the hate.

<|startoftext|>@packfanspence It must suck to have the hate for Trump run your life the way it does. Hate takes over and eliminates your ability to reason properly.  Let go of the Trump Hate and maybe, just maybe, you'll find some truth.  Not asking you to like Trump, just let go of the hate. It's unealthy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@packfanspence Of course, you'll just whine and say that's not true, yet it's on the CDC website.  Then you'll find a liberal source saying it's not true again, yet it's even worse since some were marked as COVID deaths due to car/motorcycle accidents, a few in my own county.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@packfanspence Your entire premise is destroyed when you do proper research and find out the CDC shows only 6% DIED of Covid, so about 12k to 13K.   The other 94% had an average of 2.5 other comorbidities, which means they died WITH Covid, not OF covid. That is a HUGE difference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am just gonna say it. That plane make the entire rally for me.  Why in the world did Trump ever hold rallies in stadiums?  Whoever came up with this idea is a Genius. Great images, Great crowds, Outdoors, Beautiful skies, and that Plane. WOW!!!!  #Trump2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@M2Madness Will there be some brave person at a Mainstream Media outlet willing to run a story, tell the truth, and put this out there?  Will they just continue to cover it up?

<|startoftext|>My educated guess is the actual rate of survival is close to:  Under 70 years of age - 99.9999999999997% 70 years or older, no comorbidities - 99.9999997% 70 years or older, with comorbidities - 97.999997%  Just one person's opinion that's spent way too much time researching.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We were sick, very flu-like (symptoms are close to the same), back in January. Never had a symptom since, except for headaches and a scratchy through from the worthless masks.   How many others had it in January, December, November, or even October of last year?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe Covid-19 is real. Either way, it has a 99.997% survival rate if you're under the age of 70. Even over that age it's nearly 95%.  Both percentages are before you calculate in those that might have had it, but never got tested, like me, my wife, and many people we know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now, they are trying to convince us that we need to "gear up" for a "second wave" as temperatures get colder.  What pops up during October, November, December, January, February, and March the most....THE FLU.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think about it, we had this huge death toll early on, mainly older ppl due to 5 governors shoving patients back into the hospital. Nobody was talking about flu cases or deaths at this time.   Then, we have a ton of fear-mongering cases, but the deaths plummet over the summer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This needs to be spread far and wide. Verify it for yourself, but spread it everywhere.  If it were really a PANDEMIC and not a PLAN-Demic or a Pan [Dem} ic the number would be HUGE compared to the past year.  Still think they are passing off the Flu and common cold as COVID-19.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SanctitySKR1111 Didn't it all seem a bit extreme until more was revealed tho? We live in a crazy world.   I feel like we need to dial the volume back from 100 to about 77.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Gun registration is just a tax used to track people that own guns.   A responsible gun owner owns just as many unregistered guns as registered guns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>EXACTLY and liberal hacks are saying it's not censorship.  ALL Journalists working for CBS, NBC, ABC, FOX, NY Times, and many other outlets either belong in jail for covering shit up or should at the very least lose their jobs and be blackballed from journalism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This guy right here is likely in the pocket of the Dems. He doesn't even understand the definition of censorship and you better believe if Facebook had censored the article from the NY Times about Trump's taxes, which was super sketchy, he'd be throwing a temper tantrum.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is simply sick. If anybody in a nursing home is allowing this to happen, they need to be arrested immediately.

<|startoftext|>@SethAMandel Speaking the truth doesn't make someone a jerk. I get a 7-year-old finding someone like Trump as being a jerk, but she just summed up the thoughts of most liberals.

He's already pushed until after the election, so maybe it's a play.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SenJohnThune @KendridSpiritQ So all those Dems with Gold Standard Health Care think it's a good idea to talk about the horrific ACA like they've experienced it.

<|startoftext|>@mort_murphy @ocregister @DrShayPhD Instead of blaming the President, which is Federal, maybe you should be blaming governors, who are in charge of their states.

<|startoftext|>@loveisloverey @VaughnPierce4 @LeonydusJohnson Would your company allow you to show up to work and spew your political beliefs to every customer that walked in the door?

<|startoftext|>@MeanProgress @JoeBiden I don't know who needs to hear this but when Harris/Biden eliminate the Trump tax cut, taxes will go up on 82% of Americans earning less than $400K per year.  It's really not that hard if you put the hate away and look at the entire plan.  Hate is blinding. You are blind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@13vixen @GOPChairwoman No. You just live on the surface and can't look deep enough to see the truth.  Tax cuts from Trump caused taxes to go down for most people under a $400K income.  Harris/Biden plan to get rid of that cut. When the cut goes away, taxes go up.  Gotta look at the entire plan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@liarDonaldTrump @GOPChairwoman @GOP Why do you people only see the surface?  Pay attention. Trump cut taxes for a ton of people with an income under $400K.   Harris/Biden have stated they will get rid of that cut.  Cut goes away. Taxes go up. It's not that hard.  Hate is so blinding for ya'll.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cona1960 @GOPChairwoman Gotta look deeper. Taxes go up when tax cuts are rescinded and that's the Harris/Biden plan.   They will eliminate the Trump Tax Cuts, which will cause 82% or more of Americans to see higher tax bills.   Simple math, but I'm not blinded by hate, so I can see facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Women4Biden @GOPChairwoman No, but 82% did get a tax cut from Trump, which Harris/Biden have said they will get rid of immediately after taking office.  What happens when a tax cut is gone?  Taxes go up.   Set aside the Hate and maybe you can see the truth.  Joe lied in 1987, 2007, &amp; he's lying now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CheyenneDancer @GOPChairwoman You have to dig deeper and not just live on the surface.  Trump cut taxes for many Americans under the $400K mark.  Harris/Biden have said they will get rid of that tax cut on day one.   The moment it's gone, taxes go up on 82% or more of Americans.   Hate for Trump is Blinding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mersenne859433 @GOP Nope. We just know how to look at the facts.  Biden/Harris have said they will get rid of the Tax Cuts from Trump, which will make taxes for 82% of Americans (if not more) go up.   It's really not that hard to find the truth if you're willing to put hate aside and search.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vespertilioAJR @GOPChairwoman Remember when Obama/Biden said they wouldn't raise taxes on those with an income of $250K? You should look that one up.  Joe has been lying forever. He dropped out in 1987 due to lies. He dropped out in 2007 due to lies. Why do you idiots still trust this guy?   Blinded by Hate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vespertilioAJR @GOPChairwoman The minute Joe gets rid of the Tax Cuts from Trump, your taxes go up, no matter your income. He's promised to get rid of these cuts, so if Biden wins, yes, ALL Americans will see a Tax Hike.   Facts don't care about your feelings. If you put aside the Hate, truth prevails.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>These same people treat "Their Science" as a religion and don't even understand the basic idea of Science.  They think science is absolute and true when it fits their agenda. At the core, science is theories proposed in hopes of finding facts.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Germs aren't bad for us. They help us build an immune system for many different things.   Now, it's time for me to go lick some handrails since that's the only way I can get any germs in this ass-backward world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Makes one wonder if those of us shouting that MASKS don't Work and actually weaken your immune system were right?  Logic people logic. You kill 99.9% of germs with sanitizer all day and you breathe in your own bad breath. Neither is good for your immune system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SKMorefield I can say for me, anytime I have been forced to wear a mask (wife enjoys the theme parks a bit too much) I get a scratchy throat, headache, and become very fatigued the next day.  My guess, masks + over sanitization is killing our immune systems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like someone needs to be arrested.  Next time, turn the signs into tazers and fry her little liberal hands. Maybe then she will learn not to touch other people's stuff.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@country_ca @WucherG @Mocraig13 You've got a hand gesture that can mean many things including simply OKAY.   I've got Biden with an actual Grand Wizard of the KKK. Enjoy.   https://t.co/6U5CZqID9w<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@country_ca @WucherG @Mocraig13 It's a good one to hold on to while you learn the truth. It's coming, you'll soon see or you'll go nuts trying to deny it.  Enjoy your bubble for a little longer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WucherG @country_ca @Mocraig13 Leader of the kidnapping was an anarchist. None were Trump supporters and it was likely orchestrated. Look at ALL the information not just the BS fed to you by Mainstream Media.  These ridiculous stories get debunked in a matter of days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WucherG @country_ca @Mocraig13 Really dude, Wake the F up, the violence in Portland and Kenosha came from the LEFT, not Trump, and nobody supporting Trump.

<|startoftext|>@WucherG @country_ca @Mocraig13 Okay CNN great talking points. When all you watch is mainstream garbage news, you don't have a clue what's going on. You sound like you could be on CNN.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you need more proof Obama is gay and Michelle is actually a dude? Maybe Michelle isn't Michael, but Obama certainly prefers guys, at least some of the time.  This should be headline news, but it won't be. @CNN @MSNBC @CBSNEWS @FoxNews I dare you to report on this.<|endoftext|>

Look at the CDC stating 94% of those dying from Covid had an average of 2.5 other comorbidities.  Look at the survival rate. COVID HOAX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottPresler @mdgeek2 You are a hero sir. Thank you for all your hard work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WucherG @Mocraig13 Oh boy, I hope you stock up on tissues. You are so misinformed and so blind. You're gonna need at least a pallet of tissues to dry all your liberal tears come 11/3.  BTW, today Biden got a 500 golf cart parade in The Villages Trump got a 30,000 car parade in Miami.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ewarren @JoeBiden @SaraGideon The first pictures shows signs than actual people.  The second one looks like, if I am being generous, maybe 75 people. Maybe the entire crowd isn't pictured and there are 150, being generous.  I've seen bigger impromptu parades for Trump without a politician showing up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So 30,000 cars participate in this, but the MSM in Florida want's to talk about how The Villages is turning blue due to 500 golf carts supporting Biden out of a population of 51,442 in The Villages.  Are you catching on yet #Democrats? #Biden will loose BIG.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joyinliberty Released Clinton emails but that's because I want these released already.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@seacreaturemama I'll continue to support those protecting LIFE and I will NEVER support those willing to murder the most innocent of Human Beings.    https://t.co/YA2xMs4f1b<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seacreaturemama Maybe you should use the wisdom to stop supporting the party that murders innocent children before they have a chance to know Christ. How do you think God is going to respond when he finds out you voted for people supporting infanticide and abortion?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seacreaturemama Look in the mirror lady. Seriously, you think living a life of not being afraid is now somehow tempting God? Do you cower in fear during the flu season every year, too?  I love how you assume I must think Trump is Christ-like. I never said that, you did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seacreaturemama I'm not worried about a virus with a survival rate of 99.997%, but you go ahead and live in fear.  I'll take the word of God seriously and I won't be afraid as the Bible stated 365 times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CyndiLeea @christianlasval @realDonaldTrump Yep and that's why they are voting for Trump instead of the Socialist/communist-controlled Biden. Step away from mainstream media and you'd know quite a bit more about how horrific the policies of Dems (the left at this point) really are.   Educate yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nope. The Media is too focused on 500 golf carts supporting Biden in The Villages, which has a population of 51,442.  They have Dems filled with false hope telling them a community with 51,442 ppl is going to decide Florida, a state with a population of 21 million.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They can keep giving Dems false hope. That will keep a bunch of them too stupid to know better at home where they belong.   It will also make their liberal tears so much sweeter when 11/3 rolls around and they are all crying once again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IannacconeSue @seacreaturemama Okay. we shall see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@no_silenced @OmghemanCapptec Why would they? They represent China.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KassandraKitson 90 million +<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redistrict Pro Tip: The Villages doesn't decide Florida.   Pro Tip: Biden won't win Sumter Co.  Pro Tip: Getting excited over a few hundred golf carts for Biden out of a pop. of 51,442 residents is false hope.  Pro Tip: If you like Biden, stock up on tissues for your tears coming 11/3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NSNCFic That's probably about half the voters in The Villages for Biden, which means, and I am being generous here, he will get about 2,500 to 5,000 votes from The Villages.  The population of this community - 51,442  Your only excited because Biden draws 12 people per "rally"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AP They are excited about around 500 golf carts in a community of more than 51,000 residents. Even if two voters are found, on average, in each golf cart for Biden, that's not even 1% of the entire population of The Villages.  Plus they don't cover the massive parades for Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seacreaturemama You wish it was turning...   https://t.co/34gtBgXdNP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EarlOfEnough Cover both sides you hacks.   https://t.co/34gtBgXdNP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Goss30Goss They are underestimating the conservative turnout of this state and The Villages won't decide the vote. That's just a click-bait BS headline.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this is why lowering the voting age is the dumbest thing any Democrat has ever come up with.  I say make the voting age 25, unless you own property or you're serving in the military.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@T_S_P_O_O_K_Y @JoeBiden Even a minimum wage that high only resets 0. It's a funny gaff for sure, but raising the minimum wage just resets 0 as business owners just raise their prices.  I am willing to bet if the minimum wage was $15 million, a gallon of milk would cost about $6 million.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So he's already telling Americans what they do and don't deserve.   Anybody #votingforbiden is either a submission socialist or simply hates their life. I cannot believe for a second anybody with true free will would vote for this clown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Truest statement ever said on Twatter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>EVERY single scared #Democrat, #Liberal, or #Leftist needs to pay attention to this. you're scared b/c you pay attention to #FakeNews feeding you fear.  Turn it off for the rest of October and you'll experience an entirely new outlook on life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wouldn't be mad about this, but I prefer General Flynn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MannoiaChris The golf cart parades for Trump in The Villages are about 3 to 4 times bigger than anything for Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MannoiaChris Nope. Not even close.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wonder what type of show they are going to be broadcasting??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@miketay58532035 @joynorthga I agree. That is the only fear I have, too. I will just say, with so much voter fraud coming to light, I have to believe something is being done about it. If they were getting away with it I don't think we'd see reports about it every day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope this is what happens or something very similar. I think the Clinton Emails have the ability to #wakeup a ton of liberals.  We have had many small wake up calls, but this could be the one that brings nearly all that will wake up out of their zombie slumber.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec Tell them to turn off mainstream media. I have seen about 100 big Twitter polls (10,000 to 100,000 sample) all with Trump winning hugely.   Yes, some are only really spread in Trump circles, but I have seen several hijacked from liberal circles and flipped fast.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnNewstead9 @unsilentwitness Pray.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TwitterSupport So more censorship from the Twatter overlords. Can't wait until your ridiculous platform falls apart on November 4th when we all move to Parlar.  Your gravy train is nearly done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaliNeedsHelp @Druid999S There are probably a 100 commissions that need to be dumped. Most are just power hungry people looking to control something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cupofmice @KyleSchmidlin1 @gollie_gee @KMCRadio @RWSalt @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton Besides, Science isn't something to believe in. It's not a god or a religion.

<|startoftext|>@kirstiealley @Druid999S Yes, anybody that thinks we live in a Democracy has either been brainwashed or had a horrible teacher in their Government class.  We are a Republic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharminUltra17 Only thing I got on this is the possibility that the Clinton Emails could drop and be enough. Then, once the election is done, she gets arrested and all the dominoes start to fall.  That's all I got. Outside of that, I think it's a bit odd that it's still going on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@g_grrrr That's certainly a good thing.   It's still easy to see things on here that make you think Trump is gonna lose, but he won't  I still think he will win huge and it won't even be close.  https://t.co/3ayEeXC5fh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wolfblitzer @realDonaldTrump Wolf is an idiot. He pushes fearmongering garbage and we all know the death rate of this ridiculous virus is less than the flu.   Plus, most positive tests represent around 5 to 18 people, not just one. Numbers are completely inflated.<|endoftext|>

It turns you into less of a man, backed by Science.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JulieBorowski @SouthwestAir This should tell you something. The most innocent among us often show us the truth before we see it.   Kids in masks is horrific.

<|startoftext|>@AngelWarrior321 100% deserved.   All Trump signs should be boobie trapped from now on. Electricity works great, barbed wire, razor blades, permanent ink, camera, and a paintball gun, anything to make someone think before they STEAL!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@melissadittohed Notice the bus says "Battle for the Soul" how true could is that?  Biden wants the Soul of this nation to be sold to Satan and the highest bidder.

<|startoftext|>@CHIZMAGA And 50 people showed up for the Biden event. I'd say IF we all go vote IN PERSON, it's over!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why isn't this guy old news yet? He was an average QB and he's become a race-baiting bag of tiny dicks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mac72Terry @realDonaldTrump I could start a 4 More YEARS chant in my Apartment Complex at Midnight and get more supporters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fascinating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cernovich Nope, I think Trump has this by a lot and the Dems are as desperate as they have ever been.  I'd be far more worried if so much voter fraud wasn't coming to light. If it was still hidden, it might be a small victory for Trump, but it's not.  Trump wins big on Nov. 3rd.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WaitingAtheist @StefMLozinski And now this can weigh on your soul. You just became responsible for anybody reading this and trying it. Enjoy final judgment you ironic tool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yamiche Truth hurts. Facts don't care about your feelings.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Junkyard_Dawwg She's not black. She's Indian.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaylorRMarshall @KamalaHarris She's Satanic. Only a Satanist would want more baby sacrifices.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robynwoods0303 @mercola Make your own.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is not food. It's engineered garbage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We should have High School classes dedicated to teaching the Constitution and all HS students should have to pass the citizen test before graduation.  Too many ppl think we are a democracy bc Dems say we are. We never have been and never will be a democracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidYeshua4 @realDonaldTrump I have to believe they are brainwashed to make sense of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ritanohra2 @StefMLozinski Decent people don't rationalize away ending the life of the most innocent by calling it the woman's right to choose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrumpLadyFran Nope<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@conservmillen Satanic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every last one of them should open anyway and tell Newsom where to stick it.  Businesses bowing down to the government for permission to open is UNAMERICAN.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It would be a boss move if @realDonaldTrump did this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBabylonBee So now you publish true. Interesting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VincentCrypt46 All 4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 Shut up. Masks don't work and the death rate is less than the flu.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ExpectingRain_ It gets worse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fonda said COVID is a gift for Dems and she is right. They had nothing. Before COVID, they were done. Trump was killing it with the economy.  COVID destroyed the economy (it's coming back fast) and #Democrats + #China are responsible.   #VoteTrump2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Add this to the fact that MANY have had it without a test &amp; the death rate is next to nothing!  UNLESS you are old and have multiple comorbidities, GET BACK TO LIVING.  #MASKOFF #HugsAllAround #SeeYourFriends #SeeYourGrandchildren  STOP Buying the MSM &amp; DEM Lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here it is again you fearful people. 94% have comorbidities at an average of more than 2 per death.  That means only 6% (roughly 13K) deaths were ACTUALLY from COVID.   #Covid #COVID19 #covidtruth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WSMV 100% Pence. Fly came in second.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump HUGE. Even the Fly was better than Heels Up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lovewritingxo @doqholliday Very hard to find for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickklein @Kjwalsh_news Now account for when Pence had to talk over the moderator to get any additional time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BidenHarris2020 Represents BIG Socialist GVMT.   Do you really want to be told what you can eat?   What about how you can drink your soda, if they even allow that anymore?  America is a FREE country. Big Government has no place here. #Trump is rolling back regulations like mad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lovewritingxo @doqholliday There was a time when they were, but you're right. Today, most churches (leaving the exception for a few good ones that probably do exist) are more about money and growing their numbers than anything else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doqholliday 501(c)3 ties many of the churches to the government just like Judas, they took the 30 pieces of silver.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealEricCarmen @liquidlaugh They helped China create and release it so it's not as much a gift as it is their fault.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@josh_hammer It was pre-recorded yesterday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is pathetic. Pence won and it's not because she's a woman. It's because she's a vile woman with a better mouth than a brain.  Since when did these leftist lunatics decide gender anyway??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where are you on this FAKE NEWS???  @CNN @MSNBC @CBSNews @maddow @foxnation @foxnewsalert @abcnews @ChrisCuomo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrewklavan Yep. She got destroyed in the primaries and just got destroyed tonight. I have a feeling, even though the fake polls won't show it, this is going to hurt the Dems more than they realize.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LifestylesQ @ChuckCallesto Yea, still waiting on that. Chuck isn't always right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donnabrazile You mean Wallace won't be there. Biden started the interruptions and both those loons interrupted Trump far more than the other way around.  This moderator is no better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaylorRMarshall Satanic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog GOAT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who's timing this? Harris is getting way more time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People of faith?? #BidenHarris2020 are only people of the Satanic faith.  Biden is not Catholic only uses it for votes.  Both support infanticide and abortion on demand.  No #Christan #Catholic or morally good person can vote for their murdering clowns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GHVMtnFever 100% true!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I stopped counting has the wicked  witch of the west reached 100 lies yet???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cioccolanti Plus nothing is FREE. It's not free when you tax everybody else to pay for it. That's called stealing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>No wonder old men put thier 🍆 in her mouth.   They wanted her to SHUT THE F UP!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hrkbenowen Snobby bitchy and very much ho-like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too late. We know where you stand. NBA is done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealCharlesMoon I'd stop paying taxes if that were the case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So as the left tries to twist and attack by saying @realDonaldTrump had COVID treatment with fetal tissue here's your link to debunk this BS.   https://t.co/G9MXk4CTbK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tonight it's fair to ask who Kamala slept with or sucked off the get to where she is???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoggingwithEwe @MartinStarshine @An0n661 @realDonaldTrump Yep. Curiosity is something I've always had. I had to leave Christianity to find it because I had to see the other side to know better first.  I agree fear and pride get in the way big time. Waking up is humbling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MartinStarshine @DoggingwithEwe @An0n661 @realDonaldTrump Yep. I've been saying that for a while now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anonpatriotq New to me. Never knew there was a hierarchy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@derekgilbert @chittybang2x Maybe if parents raised up their children with discipline and the proper understanding of Christ they wouldn't leave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johncardillo @ChristineHough6 @realDonaldTrump I agree hope he calls out drunk Nancy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KassandraKitson Prob the other stuff she's done has contributed too....just a guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoggingwithEwe @MartinStarshine @An0n661 @realDonaldTrump I keep having to remind myself if anybody is truly brainwashed, they are not making choices out of free will. It's so crazy the world we live in right now, but God didn't put us here to deal with it by mistake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BardsFM They will have to drag me kicking, screaming, and firing any weapons I have to get me to take a vaccine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UniversalORL Of course a form response. Wake up its not Unprecedented times, never was. I won't renew my pass and I wish I had never bought on to begin with.  You got woke, now you'll go broke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHIZMAGA @kenbone18 Better than for Biden. If they want to waste thier vote and not vote for Biden that can be helpful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kenbone18 Better than a vote for biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UniversalORL maybe its time to stop forcing your CUSTOMERS to wear masks and slather hand sanitizer on their hands.  You don't see it yet, but I'm not the only one never coming back after my pass is up in a few days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesKosur @KassandraKitson @JoeBiden Just means she is a paid for puppet. Probably bought by China.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oldguy_steve @RealCharlesMoon Sounds like CNN is trying to incite violence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods God doesn't give gifts to Satanists. COVID has only taken the lives of about 12k. Her statement is lies piled on more lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmyAmerica @NorrisTerrig64 Don't say it prove it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Temp screen, masks, social distancing, spraying down ride vehicles, and goop forced onto hands.  Big overstep and us pass holders didn't sign up for an experience that allows employees to treat is like kindergarteners.  My pass is up in a few days and I'll never come back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somebody, please explain to me hoe it's legal for @UniversalORL to force hand sanitizer onto my hands if I want to ride something.  Why arethry ruining the experience by overstepping for a virus with a 99.997 survival rate fir those under 70?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Breaking911 In handcuffs I hope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@myparentspls @KMCRadio @RWSalt @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton Prob right. Just hopeful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan @jperry188 Let's proceed with arrests and military tribunals already. We know what they did so punish them accordingly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PpollingNumbers @QuinnipiacPoll Lies lies lies. Just setting dems up for a huge disappointment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricRSammons Completely unnecessary statement.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Still don't care about the pandering Chinese basketball league.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tom2badcat Nothing on this yet????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckCallesto @wakeisaacs Media silent. AOC very loud with lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMattCouch I'm sure you agree, but I can't wait until you're wrong on one of these.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GHVMtnFever Yes from several sources now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And another. Where are your police endorsements @JoeBiden??  Oh, that's right, I ain't got any you fool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kirstiealley @atensnut Let me just say, I have been paying attention to twatter polls for months now and have yet to see one that includes both conservative and democrats end up even remotely in Biden's favor.  I've seen conservatives hijack dem polls and completely flip them more than a few times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump And for my  next trick, "All the ridiculous regulations on businesses, property owners, and the American people are gone." Poof, they are gone. America, you can enjoy your freedom once more the Corporation of the U.S.A. has been destroyed.  The LAND OF THE FREE!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anonpatriotq @mvingmtns TAKE THEM ALL DOWN!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahHuckabee @mvingmtns Many Catholics were asleep and didn't see how horrific the Democrats are until they started attacking ACB. Now, they are waking up and have had it with the FAKE Catholics like Biden and Pelosi.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It reminds me the Lebraon is the KING OF ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!!!!  Self-proclaimed kings are often demons looking to lead people away from Christ to worship them. Lebron is infested by demons. He is KING OF NOTHING!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrumperWavin 11am 11 minutes from right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I see your A for an O Mr. President. On it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Why waste time??  Just arrest these criminals. Military Tribunals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shocking from a liberal rag of a newspaper. Just as bad as CNN.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaylorRMarshall @Cernovich @realDonaldTrump I don't think Trump has ever cared about the Karen vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaylorRMarshall Too many Catholics don't question the Pope. Too many think they are supposed to follow him like he is Christ.  Wake up #CatholicTwitter this Pope is evil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is an evil evil man.  Not all Popes are saints. Not all Popes have even been good.  Corruption has happened before.  Francis is the most corrupt and the most evil EVER!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@An0n661 Sad thing is, many don't see anyhing yet. I know two dems specifically that don't even know @realDonaldTrump wants to sign a stimulus because MSM refuses to give ppl the entire truthful story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stillgray Ho back to only letting property owner vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricPerrault5 Yes<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tedcruz @SaltyVet82 @HoustonRockets @mcuban NBA is dead. A full cleaning of the entire league is necessary to return to any kind of a watchable sport.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@krissyd82 @mcuban @MichaelRapaport @NBA @tedcruz Nope you'd be wrong. No fans should cause even more people to watch from home with nothing to do, but nobody is watching because the NBA sold out to China, kneels in disrespect to the mob and their KING OF NOTHING face is a horrific racist BLM supporter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeschlossDC Wanna correct this. Obamas did it at least a few times. A real Journalist would already know this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DennisWalkerJr Maybe. I am months away from 40. You'll have to let me know if you feel older so I know what to look forward to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Scum?? That seems awfully generous for these sick demons from Satan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Nancy's Mask has a hole for a vodka bottle in it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Can we add-in, the Airlines get nothing until they get rid of their ridiculous mask mandate??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So either a comma is out of place or there's a missing 0. Intersting.  Either way, this voter fraud BS has to be stopped. It's time to secure the AMERICAN Vote!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @MarkMeadows @senatemajldr @kevinomccarthy @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer You already know Pelosi won't do anything. She's too drunk to think right now. Try again between 8am and 9am. If you can't get her then, it's dead in the water.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's gone tomorrow so the protection will also be gone. Time to arrest some seriously sick people!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kj75761283 My wife has been going nuts cause we can't go to the thrift stores.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jtcope4 @benshapiro They care only about the sick, selfish version of women they want to create, not what God created women to be, which is amazing life-giving human beings that every husband is thankful he has!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@liquidlaugh @DavarEchad That works wonderfully. I'm on board. Now, if we can get this message to @realDonaldTrump maybe he will listen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SJPFISH @Pipergirl19 The Trump supporter should press charges and have him arrested.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patton6966 @GodLovesUSA1 What's surprising is there have been multiple storms to hit LA, TX, AL, MS, and a little bit of the FL panhandle.   I was expecting storms to come directly across FL and nothing really has touched our state YET, and I stress YET.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ddwiese @sweettrinity If Trump tweets about anything proven and fact it automatically becomes false and absolutely insane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GiannoCaldwell @MAGAHULK2020 @HerschelWalker The only other conversion in the entire world I have ever heard of causing people to lose friends and family is going from non-Christian to Christian or from Protests to Catholic or vice versa.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavarEchad @liquidlaugh I was thinking Sidney Powell, but Grenell is a solid choice, too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgePapa19 That would be amazing. Put Sidney Powell in there instead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here you go NYC. Here's your elected Puppet.   The real question isn't how douchey can you get?  The real question is, who is the puppetmaster of this tool?  This dude belongs behind Bars and Concrete. He destroyed NYC and panders non-stop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrumperWavin 🤚🤚🤚<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MidtownCoffee @KMCRadio @RWSalt @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton Enjoy your cry just like 2016. I'm site you're stocked up on tissues.  Nobody with any common sense thinks Biden has a chance.  Remain brainwashed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MidtownCoffee @KMCRadio @RWSalt @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton Our last laugh will be joyous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet they blame @realDonaldTrump for it not passing. #Trump is standing between us and a stolen election, along with violent criminals running the streets.  #WakeUpAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a HUGE BOOM!!!!!  Now, unseal the indictments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump And more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My bad this is a Senator, not a "journalist". They all lie so much it's hard to tell them apart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And another "journalist," that doesn't want to report facts.  I am so sick of you clowns and you're false reporting.  This one is the fault of your boss Pelosi. She refused to budge on complete crap that does nothing to help AMERICANS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JevonWilliamsVI Nope<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, again you arewrong. Pelosi and you dem overlords killed it. Trumo just told them NO b/c they want to sneak in all kinds of BS American taxpayers don't want to fund.  #FakeNewsMediaClowns<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Truthispower20Q @Nick_Clamorgan 🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pray for God to reveal the Truth to you.  Pray for Francis to repent and step down as he should. Pray for Wisdom and Discernment Pray for other #Catholics to Wake Up to the lies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ALL #Catholics should have been done at the PACHAMAMAS. If you're still paying attention to this non-pope, it's time to #wakeup #CatholicTwitter.  This is not how a pope acts or how a #Christian acts. He is closer to Satan than Christ and we must pray.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Personally, I don't need $1,200 from the govt so badly that I can't wait until after the election. I'd gladly trade it (even if I was starving right now) to keep the horrific crap Pelosi wants from going through.  Patience is one of the most important things in a negotiation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a negotiating tactic and you have to think through it. If Pelosi &amp; the dems won't accept a $1.6 trillion plan that doesn't include their wishlist of absolute garbage, then there's no room to negotiate anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshrogin Joshy boy need a new career. The so-called "journalists" aren't even good activists. They are simply puppets spewing out the same garbage on each channel. It's all handed to them by their masters.  You're not free. We know. You sold out and now you have to live it with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngelicVixon It's funny twatter thinks it has a future after nov. 3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly. It's broken down very nicely here. Those of us that don't live in NYC, Chicago, or LA don't want to be governed like we do.  Heck, at this point, I don't think the people in those big cities want to be governed by the ppl they elected (or those that stole the election).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHIZMAGA @realDonaldTrump And downing a bottle of vodka while eating a pint of $12 ice cream.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@strangegarden7 @BreitbartNews Just one, Who'd you spread your legs for or get down on your knees for to get to where you are today?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JevonWilliamsVI Nope<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPQR_V_XIII @KMCRadio @RWSalt @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton 🙏🙏🙏🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redsteeze @seanmdav Does Biden ever come up with anything original? All I see him do is take Trump slogans and twist them a tiny bit, along with steal speeches/key points from politicians of the past.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouisMcFadden8 @GenMhayden Simple truth hurts. These Trump haters can't handle it.   In their eyes, everybody that supports Trump has to be the biggest Asshole ever and how dare you find out the truth and want to tell people about it.  Trump is destroying their fantasy world and they can't handle it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan So let's get on with arresting these traitors. Declas all the documents and get them in handcuffs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CNN is a joke. Their Poll is a Joke.   I bet if you flipped those numbers it would be more accurate. That would require CNN to actually do a real poll that doesn't have 45% Dems 30% Reps and 15% IND.  Plus 90% of Trump supporters would hang up when they said, "Hi, I'm from CNN."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@papawat1 I figured she would just spread her legs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeAnna4Congress I hope she cries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_3C_3 @JerseyGirlDeni He is satanic and worships pachamamas. Not the real pope, nor is he Catholic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@proxcee Only reason I would.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last time it was 150 million from guns and 200 million from corona.   Does he think the Gates depopulation plan has already happened?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@evilbvnny @JackPosobiec No, you're not allowed to die. If you die, you'll be voting for Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are told we can't shake hands, sing in church, or even get within six feet of anybody, yet Killer Cuomo can do this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepJohnKatko Obviously, you don't understand the strategy. Sometimes the strongest move in a negotiation is to walk away.   Pelosi doesn't care about the American People and there's a point where it's not worth trying to reason with a drunk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@keepfighting150 @daisyifyoudo68 @CNN And all those people left their circles. What's the point of being in time out in your circle if you're not going to stay there?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec More Trump supporters show up for Biden than Biden supporters. 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrumpWarRoom Where's his mask? He makes no sense. When it's 12 people in circles 20 feet from each other he wears a mask.   The inconsistency just shows it's a lie. I now believe when Joe is wearing a mask and "talking" it's just a recording.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is called censorship and it's unconstitutional.  It's time to hold these social media puppets accountable for their election tampering, fraud, and about a million other things they've done to silence one side of the aisle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaelbeatty3 And you call others conspiracy theorists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeonydusJohnson They need to be educated that the only rights you are guaranteed are the right to life, liberty, and the PURSUIT of happiness.  Somehow, they have twisted that into meaning you have a right to food, shelter, healthcare, and pleasure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have never had one and never will.  Why aren't more people suspicious of a "vaccine" grocery stores will give you a gift card for getting?  Big Pharma doesn't give anything away for free without knowing it's going to come back to them 100 fold.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time for someone with more power to step in and end this nonsense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time to strip this propaganda puppet of the DR before his mame.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TArrived17 A....on bad days a touch of B.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoRemorseAFVET4 @MattWalshBlog Stop giving them ideas!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Add it to the pile. New reports like this every week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BasementBiden1 @KMCRadio @RWSalt @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton Maybe. Some have experienced the riots first hand and living through something like that can be powerful.  NYC has gone through some of the worst of it, which is why I think that state could go red.  Not saying they will, just think there's a bigger chance than ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benshapiro Ben, you're not always good at seeing the game. Sometimes, I think you overthink things.   Trump is going to win and it won't even be close. Look around, Trump rallies have replaced Weekend sports and Biden can't even get a dozen people to show up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aMarycanOkie Don't do it. Not worth the time or the risk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NurseAnon1 @IvankaTrump Yep. I usually like Ivanka, but this is a terrible tweet from her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BasementBiden1 @KMCRadio @RWSalt @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton Some of us think CA was red last time, but there's so much voter fraud it ended up blue. If you look at both states, they are very much red except where the big cities are.   Flip a big city enough and the state goes red. Doesn't even have to be a full win in the big cities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@COsweda @PissedWarrior Don't know about anybody else, but I used to have AMAZING healthcare for around $110 per month. Now, uninsured because I can't afford the insane rates and that same plan would cost me nearly $500 a month.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@QogQdoc @SanctitySKR1111 @collar_worker @TrumperWavin 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QogQdoc @jooooody @SanctitySKR1111 @collar_worker @TrumperWavin The great deceiver is whispering directly in your ear making you one of his most dangerous tools.  Is it more dangerous to be obvious evil and easy to spot or is it more dangerous be think you know what you're talking about, yet you're spreading evil lies?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QogQdoc @jooooody @SanctitySKR1111 @collar_worker @TrumperWavin Again, you are letting hate lead you to find things wrong that aren't there, yet you want to call me the brainwashed one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QogQdoc @jooooody @SanctitySKR1111 @collar_worker @TrumperWavin You'd be wrong. I don't usually trust Snopes, but they have the video and it's pretty clear.    https://t.co/VcrmymRT1c<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QogQdoc @SanctitySKR1111 @collar_worker @TrumperWavin Really, so how do you explain Barr and Trump both stating this vaccine will NOT be mandatory. Logistics from the Military doesn't mean military force.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QogQdoc @SanctitySKR1111 @collar_worker @TrumperWavin Again not my words. Stop deciding what I am saying for yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SanctitySKR1111 @QogQdoc @collar_worker @TrumperWavin Yes. That's what I understand too. The Satanic Church stole it, as they do everything.  God = Creator Satan = Thief, Deceiver, Mocker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QogQdoc @SanctitySKR1111 @collar_worker @TrumperWavin You know what the satanic church does to Christians? it mocks. Nothing they have wasn't stolen from something good.   Satan isn't a creator, he's a mocker.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QogQdoc @collar_worker @TrumperWavin You assume too much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benstracy Oh what a pandering puppet we have here folks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SanctitySKR1111 @QogQdoc @collar_worker @TrumperWavin It's also important to note the mark of the beast will likely not be a physical mark as many believe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QogQdoc @collar_worker @TrumperWavin So an article that cherry-picks the Bible? Keep interpreting to feed your hatred of Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bennyjohnson @JoyVBehar She's the illustration in the clown's handbook and The View is a puppet show.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@unrealizzztic @DLoesch Not what he said but you've probably never listened to him without it being a clip or quote from MSM.  Good try, but you 💩 is weak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Projection. They know Biden is on drugs. It's always projection with these nut jobs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QogQdoc @collar_worker @TrumperWavin More cherry-picking, but it's obvious you think you've got it all figured you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@werd757 Fair enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QogQdoc @collar_worker @TrumperWavin Again, you are cherry-picking. One verse doesn't give us the meaning of an entire book of the bible or even a Chapter. There are so many verses that can be misinterpreted when you separate them from context.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QogQdoc @collar_worker @TrumperWavin I love how you think you have it all figured out. Yet I am the one brainwashed. So pathetic. You realize you just did EXACTLY what the left does by projecting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QogQdoc @collar_worker @TrumperWavin Your words not mine. I see how you work tho. You read what you want to read, not what's actually said. That's very dangerous when you pick up a bible.  I'd pray for wisdom and discernment if I were you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@werd757 problem when govt gets involved because those of faith have to go to court to defend their rights to not bake a cake or plan a wedding for something they believe is sin. If the govt wasn't in the marriage business, this would never happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@werd757 Personally, I think the Government should 100% be out of the marriage business. They shouldn't dictate anything that has to do with Marriage at all. Leave that to the churches and if someone wants to start a religion that allows gay marriage, that's on them.   It becomes a...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@werd757 The minute you call it Marriage, it becomes a Christian term or a term from God. This is an entirely different thing. Sadly, many churches have made a mockery of marriage on their own through pathetic vows and divorce. but Gay Marriage should not exist. Civil Union, sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@werd757 I agree, however, there's a BIG difference between Marriage and Civil Union. I actually pushed for Civil Union early on with this issue because I don't think anybody should be denied tax rights and health insurance plans if they live together, even long-time roommates.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QogQdoc @collar_worker @TrumperWavin What's your point?   I know I am not going to change your mind, but you'll wake up soon enough. It's sad that someone willing to do research can be so lost, but it happens.   Read the ENTIRE Bible and stop cherry-picking to fit your specific agenda. It might help. Plus PRAY!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QogQdoc @collar_worker @TrumperWavin Proves nothing. Yes, sometimes symbols mean something but not every Triangle is an Illuminati symbol and not every single time three 6's show up or are found by someone in an image does it mean it's satanic.   Yes, coincidences are not always coincidences, but sometimes they are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QogQdoc @collar_worker @TrumperWavin So what. If I want to catch a criminal, I will likely get close to that criminal, especially if they are living in secret and keeping things very secret behind closed doors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QogQdoc @collar_worker @TrumperWavin You call us brainwashed, but it seems like you're standing right next to the democrats that are brainwashed with your crap.   Surface thinking is highly dangerous and you're living on the surface. Look deeper.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QogQdoc @collar_worker @TrumperWavin Actions over words and symbols. Again, Trump would not be the first person God chose that did evil things before he was chosen.  Who makes more sense? An outsider to politics, but an insider to the entire Hollywood/Elite mess or a Politician that can be controlled?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So another waste of taxpayer money and time. They know it will never make it through the Senate and Trump will never sign this type of bill.  Why do WE THE PEOPLE continue to let these clowns waste our money and our time?  Term Limits and smaller salaries for ALL of Congress!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@werd757 Maybe you're not coming from a place of faith, and that's fine, but I challenge you to re-read your statement. Does it sound a bit like selfishness and greed?   Evil is very often cloaked in a coat of good. Look deeper. The surface is dangerous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@werd757 So it's about money then?  I am not homophobic by any means &amp; have several gay friends/family members, but from the faith point of view, it's pretty simple.  Homosexuality is a sin. Love cannot exist in a relationship where you lead your partner to sin regularly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QogQdoc @collar_worker @TrumperWavin I think you're also making quite a few assumptions based on the past, not the current or the future. Saint Paul literally murdered Christians before God chose him. Moses was a murderer before he was Chosen.  Shall I go on or do you just ignore these parts of the bible?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QogQdoc @collar_worker @TrumperWavin Where? Prove your work.   Revelation can be interpreted in so many ways I wouldn't be surprised is this is a false interpretation a lot like the Rapture, which isn't there either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QogQdoc @collar_worker @TrumperWavin You get close to them and you learn all their secrets. How do you disband a secret society? You certainly cannot do it from the outside.  Why do spies go undercover?  Why do police officers become a part of a drug cartel before they take them down?  Infiltration. #GodWins<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QogQdoc @collar_worker @TrumperWavin Not buying it at all. It's amazing to me how so many want to jump on the Enoch bandwagon, yet they ignore the other books Protestants removed from the bible.   It's also amazing how some cannot understand the art of war and infiltration on any level. How do you catch a criminal?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AniR95236736 @TrumperWavin I thought this too, but I think rescuing the children is going to be an ongoing effort for at least a year. I know it's already happening and there are new reports nearly every day, but I don't think they've even scratched the surface.<|endoftext|>

You just don't want to argue what I said bc you...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HurricaneAlice @cathyquick2 @DanRather That doesn't even make sense. They are literally some of the best doctors in the country and they gave the okay for Trump and whoever rode with him.

I honestly didn't think he would.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Squirrel275 @Lrihendry Sadly, it wouldn't surprise me if it was true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JRubinBlogger He'd do it right now with no issue. Anybody really believe Biden wasn't hopped up on something to get through 90 minutes??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KbPeterson4 @DaveKelley6 @DanRather and I have to believe at least some people are wondering what Hunter Biden got himself into and why Trump is bringing up Obama/Biden knowing about the spying.   It wasn't great. Wallace is a trainwreck of a moderator, but I think at least some goals were achieved by both.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KbPeterson4 @DaveKelley6 @DanRather I'm not saying Trump is perfect or it was his best debate, at all, but he cost Biden votes from the far-left while keeping his own base intact.   Plus, he put out several things many haven't heard about because they only watch MSM. Curiosity is pretty strong...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KbPeterson4 @DaveKelley6 @DanRather If you look at it from the surface, sure. I get it. Looks bad.  If you think a bit deeper, Trump accomplished his goal.   Biden said he doesn't support the Green New Deal or Defund the Police. Those comments cost Biden several far-left votes...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HurricaneAlice @cathyquick2 @DanRather already had Covid. For all you know, they could all have it right now.  You don't know. You just assume because you HATE Trump.

<|startoftext|>@HurricaneAlice @cathyquick2 @DanRather Oh, you mean the same SS Officers that are around him 24/7 already?

<|startoftext|>@LeonydusJohnson What would they have said if this was Obama? Bet it would have never been questioned.  Same hacks that should DEFUND THE POLICE &amp; ABOLISH ICE now suddenly care about a few SS Officers?  Forgive me if I don't buy a Darn Word they Say ever again!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DaveKelley6 @DanRather Taxes were prepaid, books were about certain ppl making money, the debate was only hideous for Biden and Wallace.  Wake up and stop letting lying puppets in MSM brainwash you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cathyquick2 @DanRather How many people? I count 4 in the vehicle with him all wearing masks, likely SS officers that have already been around him.  So how many ppl did he put at risk? Are you willing to admin masks don't work, then?   Seriously, common sense will get you much further than HATRED!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZemanLynnZ @DanRather @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP So you think SS officers that have been around the President this entire time are going to die from a disease with a 99.997% recovery rate if you're under the age of 70?  Wow you've been brainwashed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DrPhillipsMD You're just proving letters at the end of your name don't mean you have any common sense.  For all you know the people in his vehicle could already have it or could have already had it.  Hysteria isn't a trait I'd trust in an MD.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods Time to start a conservative streaming service and set up a whole new set of awards for real movies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimTebow Sounds like something one of the old Catholic Saints said. Can't think of which one at the moment, but he said something like, "Share the Gospel everywhere you go and when necessary, use words."  Might have been Saint Augustine, but I can't remember.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Faytuks And we all know how accurate the polls were in 2016, so I am calling complete and utter BS.  My polls are the Trump Rallies, even without him out speaking yesterday, and the Biden "gatherings".  #Trump2020LandslideVictory<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Luke4Tech @KerryMidnight @SantaSurfs @familyman20181 @X22Report I don't think it's a ship. I think it's a plane. The engine sound in the background sounds like you're sitting in a seat on a plane.  Movements are too smooth to be someone holding a camera.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Pope" Francis is a socialist satanic demon. He's not Catholic and he doesn't belong in his position of power.   The #Catholic Swamp will be drained very soon and it has already started.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@julie_kelly2 @johncardillo All I'll say is I've seen Twitter polls from clearly Democrat Biden voters get hijacked by Conservatives and completely flip.  I've seen them with over 100k votes go from 80% Biden to 65% Trump in a matter of hours.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The definition of bad parenting. Outside, young, warm outside, and yet they still muzzle their children.  So many completely brainwashed idiots in this world. Turn off MSM and start gaining your common sense back.   #Childabuse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brhodes Actually, that's called bad parenting. Putting masks on children is child abuse. They don't die from COVID and barely have symptoms. Do you put masks on your children during flu season?  Wake up and look at the real science, not the fake garbage spewed by those with an agenda.<|endoftext|>

You have no clue what QAnon is or what it stands for, nor have you taken the time to research the fact that there are hundreds of proofs to back it up.  This is like saying Jesus Christ isn't real but never picking up a bible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stewonthis1 @JoyVBehar And the hateful attitude?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@liquidlaugh They've answered this question time and time again by their actions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RippedGimp18 @StefMLozinski Saying the Mass is the Mass is like saying Love is Love.  It's a meaningless phrase until you define "Mass" or "Love" &amp; this type of distraction tactic is used by demons working for Satan.  It's very dangerous to cheapen the definition of the Mass or Love in this way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UnbiasedKatie You are a very sad woman. Holding the door is a sign of respect and chivalry. Real women appreciate it and prefer a man willing to make such a gesture.  Enjoy you beta male babies cuase you'll never get an alpha.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RadTradWewLad @ChurchCandace @TaylorRMarshall @JoeBiden @VeritasRadioNet @TheKingDude Tied to the govt regardless. They shouldn't stand for being forced to play ads that go against Catholic beliefs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StefMLozinski Except the so-called positive good liturgy is driving people from the church in droves. It has slowly corrupted Catholics into thinking many very important things are not.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DavidPaternostr And train up about 1,000 new exorcists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bring on the exircisms. Evils is coming into the light in full force today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely shameful. Hope they are the first media outlet to fall and whoever decided this was a good idea gets booted first.  Sick, vile, evil ppl are the LEFT.  Bring in the Exorcists!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. If you fit this description you likely need an exorcism, repentance, and Jesus ASAP!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Humans needing demons exorcised = leftists wishing harm on the President.  They are the same ppl wishing all Trump supporters death. The demon of Hate is very strong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another sick leftist.  Good vs evil  Dark is being exposed  Mass exorcisms needed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These are the people you support, follow, and let influence you #democrats, #liberals, and #leftists.  There is 0 compassion left in these evil people.  Choose good or evil. This isn't just another election. It's life or death.  #redpill<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SenKamalaHarris @DrSue19380 Stop lying. We all know you are full of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And ABSOLUTELY every other battle that matters.  The only battle @JoeBiden can win is the Pandering and kneeling battle. He's got those two tied up for life!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Says the daughter of the devil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All I see is a group of oddballs that are about to have very sore behinds and plenty of chaffing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MajorPatriot Probably was. The Catholic church is going to get cleanec out of the wolves. It's already started.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaChr56994429 No it's not. I highly doubt Biden carries rosary beads on him ever. Ppl that take the rosary seriously would never support abortion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshdcaplan Why wasn't that already illegal??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArtValley818_ $12 per hour each. He put out a Craigslist ad and can't even pay them the $15 per hour each that Soros pays the rioters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BidenLies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrumpWarRoom @OmghemanCapptec Just one of many, many of the #Bidenlies from last night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dbongino Notice, the article says Top Six...that implies there were more than six...I counted 12 before I stopped counting last night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NurseAnon1 I want to see the hands. It gives it away if it's a younger person with a Biden mask.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharminUltra17 I've seen a lot of rosary beads in my time. Usually, you need beads for it to be rosary beads, not a stiff wire.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaylorRMarshall @realDonaldTrump That's assuming a lot of commonly blue states don't flip. It's gonna be much more like a very red map than worrying about a few states.   All 4 you mention will be red, alog with CA, MN, and NY if the dems aren't allowed to cheat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Patriot_USA78 And now that Twatter suspended that account we know it's pretty much true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this the liar all you #liberals and #democrats are voting for because #Trump hurt your feelings once?  Do you want a President that's going to take more moneybout of your pocket?   Don't #VoteforBiden Vote #Trump2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RepsForBiden @tpatreon81 If you're for Joe Biden just admit you're a leftist cause you sure aren't a Republican.  More puppets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@undercoverpat1 Interesting. Wonder why that is?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@undercoverpat1 Yep. I've blocked so many they barely even show them to me anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here you go #Liberals and #Democrats. If this doesn't show you the truth about #BidenLies I don't know what to tell you. If you cannot see that #JoeBiden is a liar, you must be completely brainwashed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here is another one #Liberals and #Democrats, except this is a #TrumpTruth not a #BidenLie, although he denied it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BidenLies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SantaSurfing17 Working on getting #BidenLies trending. In honor of the dozen lies from the debate, maybe more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog I agree. There were several times he stopped things and didn't let any dead air happen to allow Biden to respond to anything real.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let me add to this. Alternative energy isn't exactly eco-friendly. Sure it sounds good, but when you look deeper the supplies needed cause more harm to the environment than coal and gas, especially solar. It's a mess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another one of the #BidenLies for you #Democrats and #Liberals to learn about now. Trust me when I say, there are at least a dozen reports just like this picture out there and most are from the past week or so.   Some from earlier elections and primaries, too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's another #BidenLie from #Debate2020. Read the article #Liberals and #Democrats. Read the full quote of what @realDonaldTrump said instead of cherry-picking what fits your narrative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmmmm....#JoeBiden says he didn't call American Servicemembers "stupid bastards." The video evidence says something else.   This is another #BidenLie from #Debate2020 for you #Liberals and #Democrats to enjoy. This is your candidate. Of course, you could just take the #RedPill!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here you go #Democrats &amp; #Liberals. Another #BidenLie from #Debate2020. This is just the very tip of the iceberg with #HunterBiden, too.   He's a dirty, dirty criminal and it will all come out soon enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No small business will survive and our country will turn into an elaborate prison. Do you really think this old man can do anything good for America?  His 47-year record shows he won't. His Green New Deal shows he will rape this country for the gain of Democrats Politicians.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anybody on the #left, any #Democrats, any #Liberals, any #Moderates (if you actually exist still) really think #JoeBiden is for the working people of this country?  If he gets elected and we shut down again, 50+ million jobs will be gone overnight...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here you go #Liberals &amp; #Democrats believing what #SleepJoe  &amp; his handlers are feeding you. It's on video unlike the smears the #Dems make up about @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's another #BidenLie for you #Democrats &amp; #Liberals out there. There are some many lies from #SleepyJoe tonight it's amazing.  He just Lies &amp; Denies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cioccolanti He also turned around a few seconds later and called it the Green New Deal.   He lied and denied all night long.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here you go #Liberals and #Democrats planning to #VoteForBiden. Here's lie #1 of many from tonight's debate from #Biden.  I'm sure it won't be long before the video of #SleepyJoe calling our military "Stupid Bast**ds" goes viral too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benshapiro @bricmckinley He probably doesn't even understand what that means so he just avoids the question until people move on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How's he going to look if even half of what Trump just accused him of becomes true before the election?  I hope someone truly fact checks Biden because I feel like he said about a dozen things that were so far from the truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heck, Biden lied about his plan being the Green New Deal and then admitted it was a minute later.  He just denied the Hunter Biden stuff and used the "Trump just lies" defense quite a bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel like the debate was a huge set up for something coming shortly. @realDonaldTrump unleashed some info that might sow a few seeds with those unaware of the ballot fraud, Hunter Biden stuff, &amp; a few other things.  Plus, Biden lied a number of times and denied several things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hrkbenowen Drugged<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog Debate didn't matter. It wasn't about changing minds. If you're not already for Trump, this debate wasn't going to change your mind.  The two sides are so far from the middle it takes more than two guys interrupting themselves all night to change someone's mind on the fence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marklevinshow You know those voting for Biden only read headlines. That's why they always argue simple talking points that can easily be refuted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog Yet. Stressing the word Yet, especially after the declassified documents from today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does anybody believe that any "journalist" (using that term rather loosely here) at The Atlantic has any type of access to @realDonaldTrump to know what he says in secret.   They are just making up anything they can because they think someone might fall for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheJordanRachel Change his depends.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rosaclemente Good. Find a new gig race baiter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benshapiro Abolish Income and Property Tax. It's unconstitutional. At the same time get rid of the many insane regulations counties put on building on your own land.

<|startoftext|>@Trucker1776 Q has also said misinformation is used because the DS watches the boards too. I'm not saying I think JFK jr is alive, but I'm also not discounting it.

<|startoftext|>@AmericanWife2 No worries it happens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trucker1776 He pulls this kind of crap every time he finds a post about it. It's old and divisive.

<|startoftext|>@LaflerTina No need to apologize. The only Catholics that can't see this so-called Pope is the most corrupt Pope in history are brainwashed and would drink any Koolaid he served them.  Catholic Church is splitting into Pope Catholics and TLM Catholics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Notice how it's a black cop and a white woman, but I have yet to see one Conservative try to make it about race.  Switch it to a white cop and a black woman and MSM would be using it for race-baiting on all networks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Were you there or do you just not like the fact that the real story doesn't fit the narrative you were fed to get you all pissed off at cops?  It's really pretty simple. If you don't way bullets fired into your house, don't open fire on cops.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The Pope IS NOT your God or the God of anything. He is human, riddled withhumam error, &amp; this current one is corrupt.  If you follow the words of the Pope, Bishops, or Priests blindly without question, you are not doing your job as a Catholic.  Follow Christ ONLY!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let me make this as clear as I can for #Catholics. A #Vote for any Pro-Abortion (same as Pro-Choice) candidate IS a GRAVE sin.  There is no way around it &amp; it doesn't matter what ANY Pope says.  The Pope's beliefs, writings, &amp; words ARE NOT Gospel. ..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mcgirty904 @MattWalshBlog Mine did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joyinliberty No<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @realDonaldTrump has the balls to let a Dem moderate his town hall, but #SleepyJoe gets @andersoncooper.  Expect pathetic softball questions and no pushback all night...oh, and basement ratings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cernovich @joerogan He's a big fat sell out anyway. Not worth watching unless he has a reallu good guest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarluskaP Okay a cpl things that bother me...  One, she always wears the neck scarf. What's it hiding?  Two, her hands don't look old. Can't find a close up tho.  Three, she has two sets of eyebrows or whatever they are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmericanWife2 @Qtah17 Mass arrests of Antifa would be a nice present for us 17ers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckCallesto Nope<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FOX29philly Oh surprise surprise...time to spread disinformation to fit the narrative. Even local news is filled with puppets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@liquidlaugh Like 15 things happened today. Did you miss it??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NurseAnon1 Also assumes Jim Carey is not in jail.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EricRSammons Still trying to figure out which spiritual masters this so-called pope is referring to? Thought we were only supposed to have one master.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaylorRMarshall How many spiritual masters does the pope have?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pontifex Um....have you even read the bible, seriously "Pope" this statement is so misleading and incorrect it's not even worth reading.  Which spiritual masters are you bowing down to?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@selenamrtnz @BET And here we see a special kind of stupid and brainwashed.   If you think Kamala is a good choice, you need to dig much deeper than the CNN voice in your ear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Again, if you even care what brand shoes the person you plan to vote for, whether #democrat or #republican, you're a special kind of idiot.  You represent those that should not be able to vote if this is even close to a deciding factor for you.  NOBODY CARES ABOUT HER SHOES!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you #VoteDemocrat based on the shoes #Kamala wears you are a special kind of idiot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@K1mibear @jane51487 @MattWalshBlog Only so much we can do in an apartment. We had issues when we traveled in an RV, but those were to be expected, as it's not the most controlled environment.  Good advice, too. Thank you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cjtruth @BeanoChico you shouldn't. I don't deserve heaven, but please have mercy on my soul.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog Yes, storebought tomatoes often needs to be left out to become ripe.   Better to just grow your own, tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog Yes, I agree, except in Florida, you have very little choice. Leave butter out and it molds within days.  My wife didn't finish her bagel yesterday and left part out with cream cheese on it. Within a couple hours, it was moldy.   Some of us need to extend the life, too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If a National Poll is willing to put Trump up by 1 point he's probably really up by about 15-20 points.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NoDaTeddi @Johnheretohelp 17 just told us they know the playbook.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@patton6966 really hope white hats are in control of the weather.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like Hurricanes Teddy &amp; Vicky are lining up to head towards Florida in a week or two with another potential storm following.

<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 No sense of humor for dems, ever, and MSM has been spreading lies as truth since before Trump took ofc so put where the sun don't shine puppet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoDaTeddi @Johnheretohelp Be careful with letting threads like this instill fear. They want us scared and they want us to assume Trump doesn't have a plan for it all.  He is way ahead of them. It will never get to the point this thread assumes.  Prepare, yes.  Freak out, no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VioletIrwin76 White hats in control. Enjoy the show.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jordan_Sather_ You're one of the worst I've seen at sowing division.  Look in a mirror and stop acting like an arrogant know it all.  Leaders unite and don't chastise ppl because they disagree with them.  You are not a leader so back up and take your place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If this is true it just proves ALL #Catholics that #Vote4Biden are either brainwashed (no free will), blinded by hatred, or not really Catholic.  What do you think #CatholicTwitter ??  https://t.co/8yenZCariN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patton6966 Hurricane Sally was going to barely touch the very Red Florida panhandle. Now,  the panhandle is gonna get hit pretty heavy after a sudden shift in the path.  Wonder who has control of the weather??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrBiden You belong in jail for elder abuse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dianarr @larryelder @SmithSeigel You are taking the very small percentage &amp; conflating it into a systemwide massive issue it isn't.  It's like deciding abortion must be okay because of rape &amp; incest (make up 2% of abortions).  The exception to the rule shouldn't be used to rationalize changing the system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dianarr @larryelder @SmithSeigel Except 99% of these incidents keep showing ppl on drugs, resisting arrest, acting like idiots, and putting the lives of cops in danger.  Unarmed also doesn't mean peaceful or not dangerous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KWardCummings @larryelder The simple fact that, intotal it's 39 out of millions of encounters should tell you all you need to know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marklevinshow Correction: When they lose the election.   My guess, Trump won't care so much about optics, and mass arrests will happen with very high bail amounts. I give it a week b4 it's cleaned up, max.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JennaEllisEsq Truth hurts. She will need that second bottle of vodka today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jordan_Sather_ The problem is arrogant people like you think you've got it all figured out, but you don't.  If you did you'd understand the very basic Q 101 principle of THINK FOR YOURSELF.  You don't have to agree, but acting like an arrogant a-hole just makes you a bully/divider.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Tinder and arsonists are a bad combination.  Even on the hottest day, you still need a magnifying glass to have any chance of lighting an ant on fire.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden finally strings a few sentences together without sounding like a bumbling idiot and this is his message?  Are you serious? Now it's Trump's fault whenever the clouds create rain, fires are started by BLM arsonists, and a hurricane hit the coast during hurricane season?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Arresting Arsonist and holding them indefinitely will also stop the "wildfires".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The left is trying to scare ppl with the ultimatum of, #VoteBiden or we will continue to destroy.  What these propaganda peddling puppets don't understand is after the #TrumpLandslideVictory2020 he will no longer hold back when to comes to cleaning out the #BLM &amp; #Antifa psychos.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AdrBell Nobody is buying your filthy lies.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Lrihendry That would be a start, but they gotta do more than just stop kneeling.  I'm done until sports leagues are cleaned out of the corruption, support for BLM, and they return to purity that causes us all to fall in love with the game they've corrupted.  Quit most years ago.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Lovewritingxo We did. Stated it was specifically for cuties even though we had many other reasons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biggest lie you ever told you pathetic rag. Don't worry your propaganda outlet, along with many others won't last much longer.  I might shed a single tear for all your brainwashed "journalists" that won't be able to find a job just to show I do care about all humans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is for Mr. King of Nothing @KingJames &amp; anybody else pushing such a ridiculous lie.

<|startoftext|>@aubrey_huff Did vegan for a year after a few months of pescatarian. Now, I practice a flexitarian diet. Much better IMHO.   Vegan was not only super limiting when around others, but it also made me feel weaker. That's just me tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>King of ABSOLUTELY nothing Lebron has some blood on his hands.  Who taught ppl to start addressing themselves as king or queen anyway? Where did this self-aggrandizing, egotistical trend come from?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMattCouch I can't watch it. I was a huge Notre Dame Fan but after Brian Kelly &amp; others on the staff, including others in charge of the University, came out in support of BLM, I had to say no more.   I was already on the fence as a Catholic Man due to UND not sticking to Catholic teachings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ilhan You're just mad because they were imported to vote for you and how you're scam is up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@I_Am_Patrioticc NCAA. Many coaches/executives at Universities including private schools like Notre Dame voiced their support for BLM and hate Trump.  I won't be watching NCAA football or any other sport.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MikeSma20797052 @CllrBSilvester @NotGah And furthermore, it's rather ignorant to assume keeping a business open is only worth $20k or whatever the income is this year.

<|startoftext|>@MikeSma20797052 @CllrBSilvester @NotGah And you did imply that with your "human sacrifice" comment. Every year 10s of thousands die from the flu (most with co-morbidities).   It's a valid comparison and businesses never shut down for the flu.  Do you also think roads should be closed? Lots die from car accidents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeSma20797052 @CllrBSilvester @NotGah It doesn't account for deaths from the actual shutdown, mental disorder, or destroyed businesses.  The simple fact that you think a business can shut down for a year and magically open back up is insane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeSma20797052 @CllrBSilvester @NotGah Again, your logic makes no sense. We've had treatments from day 1.

<|startoftext|>@HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump Have you heard them or are you just going along with the story like a good little brainwashed puppet?  Every single person saying they have listened to the entire audiotapes is saying this is another BS story.   Bet another 5 books are published smearing Trump before 11/3.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@doqholliday Well said! Instead of calling ppl out for what they decide to believe, we should consider the possibilities.  Open hearts and minds help attract people to the truth.  It's likely we are all going to end up being partially right and partially wrong...AND THAT'S OKAY!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doqholliday @Phaethon314 @TrumperWavin @VincentCrypt46 Damn, you too? I thought I was the only one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TB_IMPACT All lives matter, of course. You are correct, tho, &amp; some of us have been saying this for years.   I know fatherless children are rampant in the black community. It's also a problem in other races &amp; it's the one statistic that lines up the most with criminals of any race.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jordan_Sather_ Believe what you want, but let others believe what they want, too.   It's not helpful to approach things with a chip on your shoulder or with arrogance.   Patience, understanding, and kindness go a lot further.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SenatorCarper @realDonaldTrump I mean, seriously, the NEW YORK TIMES, as much as I don't trust them, said the numbers were bloated and by A LOT!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorCarper @realDonaldTrump Perhaps if you read the new CDC report you'd realize the numbers are about 94% less on deaths.  Perhaps if you looked at Collin County TX you'd realize the case numbers are also about 94% less.  Perhaps if you stopped looking to blame and looked at the facts, you'd see the truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliansRum Seven weeks takes us to about one week before the election. Trump said the summer was gonna be hot and mentioned 8 weeks, which is up on 9/15.   Does this mean we are in for a few days of nutso craziness with the overlap??  (not that it's not already nutso craziness out there)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TrumperWavin @Jordan_Sather_ Yes. There is good research for both. Plus, if you were gonna fake your death and disappear would you be easy to find?  I'm not saying either theory is true, but they are valid theories.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrumperWavin There are a few self-proclaimed experts/leaders that spend more time trying to make sure ppl believe what they think than thinking free &amp; letting others think freely.  The only experts are the less than 10. Decide for yourself what to believe &amp; become aware of all possibilities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeSma20797052 @CllrBSilvester @NotGah By your ridiculous logic, every business should be shut every flu season. Death is a part of life. Illness and disease too.   We either get back to living or we might as well all be prisoners or dead.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Deep down, I think you know it. I think if you actually take time to think through what you are say when you spout ACAB or any other demeaning phase towards our wonderful police, you will stop saying it.  It's time #liberals. It's time to #WakeUpAmerica &amp; #BackTheBlue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet, you're willing to label all cops.   By your logic, if a Black person murders someone, all black people are now bas***ds.   By your logic, if an Asian person shoots someone, all Asian people are now bas***ds.  And so on.   It's not logic. It's lunacy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Start by realizing ACAB is just a different type of #racism. You're deciding an entire group of people is a certain thing based on the uniform they wear/job they chose. It's #racist whether you like it or not.  You wouldn't dare label all Blacks or all Hispanics or all Asians.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're #liberal and you've stuck with me this long, it's time to #wakeup a bit.   I'm not asking you to become a #TrumpSupporter or abandon all your #liberalthinking.  Just start with the #Police. Start by understanding the actions of a few do not warrant labeling all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What if that cop you called a bas***d today is the same cop you need tomorrow?  Whether you believe me or not (after all, if you're under 23, you probably know everything and I'm just an idiot because I'm close to double your age) Calling All Cops Ba**ards won't end well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do you, #liberals, think it's okay to label ALL Cops as B**tards?   What makes you think this is tolerant, compassionate, or even remotely right?  Do you think before you speak, post, or spray paint graffiti?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To all the #liberals out there willing to read my posts, would you be okay if #Conservatives decided to label all #LGBTQ people as #pedophiles because of a few?  Would you be okay if we labeled all #democrats as criminals based on the actions of a few? (it's more than a few, btw)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anybody else think many of these #youngliberals need a wake up call requiring the help of police?  Those of us that have needed the help of police understand their value and know not to JUDGE an entire group based on the actions of a FEW!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would they not be outraged if #conservatives targeted an entire group, such as the #LGBTQ group?  Why do these young, usually well-off, #liberals think they can just label Police like this?   Would they call 9-1-1 if someone broke into their home?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Liberals are supposed to be the party of tolerance and they often spout compassion as their reason for, well, so many things.  Is it compassionate to target an entire group of HUMAN BEINGS with a nasty word/label?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have you seen this sick Acronym?  A.C.A.B #acab  Do you know what it stands for?  It's being spread by young #liberals, probably many from very affluent families.   This is a problem. It should be a problem for everybody, even #democrats and #leftists.   https://t.co/ub3uwZkX24<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Aaaaaand just like that Trump is turning a ton of ppl into #antivaxxers or at least making them think twice.  It's funny how ppl still can't see how far ahead his admin is...always 5 steps ahead.  CNN is going to look so foolish, again.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So here we go again. Race-baiting at its' finest. Labeling someone to attack an entire race with 0 details of what happened, yet those of us seeking truth are called racist.

<|startoftext|>@AndrewBatesNC You comment Dems and liberals are so blind and so lost. Conservatives, including Trump, have been calling out this violence since May, while your so-called leaders we said nothing or incited violence.  This is your party.   https://t.co/r7PAKmivNm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nypost That's laughable coming from a dude.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why not? At this point the @NFL lost half thier fans when the condoned kneeling for the flag.  They lost another 25% when they decided to play the fake "black anthem".  The only fans left are dems, so why not cater to them exclusively?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusanStJames3 Probably just the parents of staffers showing support for their kids.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MarkDice The assholes laughing should be arrested too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Acosta Yet the CDC says 6% are actual COVID deaths. Report all the facts you fake news puppet.  Plus Collin County was audited and their cases went from 4600+ to 100.   Bet those 6 million cases are more like 1 million.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid Actually, the CDC already chopped that number down to 6%. Plus, hacks like you still haven't blamed Obama for the swine flu deaths. Maybe you should get on that instead of spewing your hatred for Trump everywhere.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jojo177617 I avoid hating them. Instead, I try to believe they are victims of severe brainwashing and haven't made a decision with a truly open mind for years.  I also try to remember some will still wake up and others will need our help when the shock sets in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KingJames (king of nothing) you support this. You are either a brainwashed bought and paid for Chinese puppet, a greedy asshat, or a completely violent psychopath.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I bet these bought and paid puppets haven't even seen more than the original clip.  The gameplan is always the same. Release a small portion of what happened to create outrage.

<|startoftext|>Now I know Lebron James is a part of twatters little clan. Got suspended for telling the truth about the King of Nothing.   I can't wait until 11/4. That's the day I leave this shithole for good.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Qtah17 @TheRevDrPepe @realDonaldTrump All for a dangerous criminal with a weapon and warrants for guy's arrest.

<|startoftext|>Makes a person wonder if this is all a set up for $$$. George Floyd's family is now millionaires too and both hheand #JacobBlake were criminals doing criminal things.

<|startoftext|>Come at me like this and my fork, knife, spoon, and fists become lethal weapons used to put your punk as on the ground.   I do not care if this is a WOMAN.

<|startoftext|>Before you jump to #racism with the #JacobBlakeshooting know the facts.   Too often, ppl jump to the race conclusion in a short video clip and nothing before the incident.   Critical thinking is key and patience makes a difference.    https://t.co/Fa80F2F5OG<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I bet this caused lots of #liberaltears. The full speech from @TimScottSC should be watched by all #democrats, #liberals, and #independents.  It's that important. If you miss it, you might be making a huge mistake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here you go #democrats #liberals and #biden voters.  This one is for you! Enjoy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're #Catholic &amp; you're not sure who to vote for, or you've already decided you'll vote for #JoeBiden, I URGE you to watch the #RNC night 1 with an open mind.  It might not change your mind if you plan to #VoteBiden, but it's worth watching. #CatholicTwitter Please Watch!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmm....So-called #Catholic #JoeBiden gets nominated by the party that can't be bothered to leave "Under God" in our pledge.  Non-Catholic #DonaldTrump gets nominated by the party starting the #RNC off with a Catholic Cardinal Praying &amp; the Pledge, said properly by a Veteran!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So they think I can get COVID from my own fingers or do they assume people are licking each other's fingers??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  Can we say full panic mode?  @SpeakerPelosi is a master manipulator.  #Dems ate just pissed bc they can't cheat thru voting machines anymore.  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GKeile If this has to do with not wearing a mask, it's pathetic, considering the b**ch's mask comes all the way down and nearly off as she's yelling at this guy.  She needs to go to jail for a HATE CRIME!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atensnut Me too and her mask is coming off at the end, which just shows how much of a hypocrite she is.  Masks don't belong in CHURCH!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ImAwakeRU72 As little as possible. We live by theme parks and had passes before all this, so we do in order to go and get our fun in, but that's it.   I break every rule I can and have nearly been kicked out of the parks, as well.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SantaSurfing17 @me_think_free I've seen both HCQ and a plasma treatment mentioned. May not be HCQ announcement tonight, but we shall see. Fingers crossed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenAshleyWright Here is an idiot that fails to have basic knowledge of how flowers and plants work,  When was the last time you saw a rose garden bloom five seconds after it was planted in AUGUST?  Maybe you should stick to writing fake history books.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CharminUltra17 It will be mass panic considering the chances it hits the earth are about the same as dying from COVID.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love the tie!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most of us actually think the numbers are a complete load of shit and exaggerated. If they gave accurate numbers there wouldn't be panic.  Death numbers are a lie. Case numbers are projected and a lie. Real numbers are about half or even less of what they tell us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@catturd2 He's going to announce some type of plasma treatment. I'd live it to be about HCQ, but I think that's just wishful thinking right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@susansaga1 @LindaLiberty9 Two of the most Anti-Catholic, Anti-Christian, Anti-God professional politicians this world has ever seen. They are influenced if not possessed, by demons and Satan is in full control of these WOLVES.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hey #democrats, #liberals, and anybody else planning to #VoteBlue, they are counting on you remaining distracted and stupid.  #dems literally feed on uninformed #voters. Take time to do your own research instead of just buying what they sell you on #MSM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DearAuntCrabby Or you could say, even 35% of those going through liberal brainwashing camps still see the value of a President for ALL Americans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You just made a really big assumption. Some of the dumbest people I've ever met had college degrees and some of the smartest never went to college.  The proper way to say this is...  Trump is leading with hardworking Americans, not liberal crybabies with useless degrees.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JenAshleyWright If we all had to go back to farming to support our families this person would probably plant a seed today and wonder why it didn't produce food within a few hours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenAshleyWright And another idiot was born. Before attacking someone or something it's important to do basic research. Maybe you should have googled, "when do roses bloom?"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@USPoliticsPoll Sounds like something stupid a CNN reporter would say. Pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These idiots can't even be bothered to do the tiny bit of research necessary to impersonate a Trump supporter.  To those paying attention, these are so obviously imposters trying to make us look bad.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realCoyotay @ColtheMong @GOPLeader There was a link up about a month ago I shared on my old twatter account. It's long gone now. Youtube banned it and I haven't been able to find it since.   Insanely disturbing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Sarah25540235 @mil_ops Wondering the same thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sarah25540235 @WeGoAll3 @mil_ops It makes me wonder if maybe it's due to treason. If it's treason doesn't that require a military tribunal and would Barr have any say over it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jlleee1 Good call.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's already working on it and his name is President Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader Wish I could NOT show up to do my job and still get paid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sarah25540235 @mil_ops That's a good question. If it's treason isn't a military tribunal necessary?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Hoosiers1986 Same here<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RepMontague We are here and very awake!! We voted for you!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bennyjohnson Reading the comments on this reminds me how insanely selfish and mean so many ppl are. Of course, they are Biden bullies and lack basic humanity.  Maybe one day they will realize they are being brainwashed by the party of satan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@render_nyc @bennyjohnson Maybe when you stop blaming Trump for everything you'll wake up to the truth. You probably like that a little boy was attacked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martingeddes We are right there with ya. I want 10 acres to myself to grow food, live without needing to count on the government for a thing, and control how much time I spend in mainstream society.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DurhamTiberius @TweetWordz Not to mention rolling blackouts in Cali, which is going to go red this year and a land hurricane just hurt Iowa, too.  All planned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandPaul @dyolltrah Yes. I will do whatever it takes to ensure our freedoms are protected for us and for future generations. It so important, I am willing to give my life, if that's what God has called me to do!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They can "cave" all they want. We all know where they really stand. Gonna take much more than a fake apology to earn my business.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@prayingmedic I also think they are trying to trap some of these politicians. They want to link Trump and/or Pence to Q so they can release a FF to make them look bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaylorRooks This sounds like a 10-year-old trying to give a book report on something he hasn't read yet.  Plus, self-proclaimed kings seeking adoring fans tend to be tools of the devil.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LALang12049217 @mil_ops I'd buy AI for sure and body doubles (stunt doubles), but I struggle to buy clones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeAreP22 @mil_ops The 8 weeks, I believe, puts us at 9/15, so we have a bit more time left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QSentMe76 @mil_ops Possibly why so much of it was pre-recorded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tamaraG68630137 @mil_ops Maybe body doubles. I don't completely buy clones, but body doubles (possibly with plastic surgery) have been used for a long time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeGoAll3 @mil_ops Yep. I think that's why the arrests are basically low-level people we haven't heard of with some medium-level. Gotta get little fish to turn on bigger fish to ensure it's a slam dunk.  Someone told me, a while back, Barr and Trump won't go after someone without 100% certainty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billybloop @mil_ops I believe some of it was for sure. A lot was pre-recorded and who knows when it was recorded.   I'm always interested to see what's in the background like Warren spelling BLM with blocks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alwaysmeagen23 @mil_ops I agree. I feel like there have been a bunch of small to medium-sized things causing more and more people to wake up.  I think it has to happen gradually or it would shock too many people, but I bet we are getting very close to 50% awake, even if some won't admit it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blake12805382 @mil_ops I think there is some of this going on. I also think we have to be aware many small fish (names we may not really know) have been arrested already. Small fish turn on medium fish, and they turn on big fish, so it's a bit of a process.  Lots and lots of recent Pedo arrests, too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Malcolm_fleX48 Just like super skinny unhealthy women should not be idolized, neither should those that look like they are about to go into a diabetic coma. This isn't physical beauty. It's a health issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Biden has a handful of golf carts for his parade. Trump has had MULTIPLE boat parades with hundreds, some with thousands of boats.  Not to mention the golf cart parade in The Villages on Trump's Bday in June was much bigger than this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DizzoTha @kimguilfoyle @realDonaldTrump JR said he's on it!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mil_ops 99% sure scenario 1 is most likely, but maybe secret option 3 where enough arrests happen it's far more contained.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MajorPatriot We knew he was swampy tho.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MandyCrisner @GeorgePapa19 And if you buy that all of those are from COVID you're brainwashed.

<|startoftext|>@Chamaa @MikeTierno1 @CharminUltra17 @BlueSeaSailing Food has NEVER been free. There has ALWAYS been a trade-off to get food, whether trading with another person or trading time/labor to create food.  Someone has to produce it, therefore it's not free. Even bread lines require a person to trade time for food.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chamaa @MikeTierno1 @CharminUltra17 @BlueSeaSailing Oh, it will be a new world, but I have a feeling people like you won't like it much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lt_freedom They also have no desire to hear the truth. Won't let anybody comment.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Chamaa @MikeTierno1 @CharminUltra17 @BlueSeaSailing Food was never meant to be free either. We reap what we sow. Foid must be produced by people and traded/given to others producing other things as a form of trade. Yea, charity is good for those in need, but the idea that anything is truly free is just lazy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chamaa @MikeTierno1 @CharminUltra17 @BlueSeaSailing Oh my wow are you a lost soul. If you really think a communist and capitalist can work together for the good of people you really should do more research because you clearly don't know what either of those are.  Move to China and live in communism. I bet you'd change your mind.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JuliansRum @KarluskaP Look below the surface.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DLoesch And who funded this ridiculous study??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods If the slong fits....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaylorRMarshall In a time when we need to hear from our spiritual leaders, they want to muzzle them.  How any Catholic can't see the infiltration of wolves is beyond me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruelovefromGod @nepheshim They only choose candidates they know the can control.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SidneyPowell1 Him/her couldn't get the guards to okay another recording.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@James78141017 @DailyCaller It certainly didn't look like the background you'd find at a mansion much like the SNL with Tom Hanks didn't look like a mansion kitchen.  Recorded says to me dead or in Gitmo singing like a canary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@re5iQam @_LoveMTB_ This one yes. Not every Pope has been controlled or evil, however.   The Catholic Church is on the verge of returning to pre-Vatican 2 times, which is huge and won't be led by this Pope or many of the current clergy.  My guess, about 75% are going to jail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@prayingmedic Well, let's see...  Trump moves markets Trump has kept us out of war And, I seem to remember a recent peace deal that's a pretty big deal.  The right MAN is in office. Michelle/Michael can stay out of this one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1blantdaddy The Office for a laugh. Lost for something odd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProjectLincoln 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  It's a pre-recorded 💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩  show!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@parscale Considering both are satanic rituals I can see why it would be hard to see the difference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HollyLu59864099 Paul Managort or Julian Assange.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marklutchman Doesn't that take their fake blame off Trump?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hrkbenowen I pissed off my UAW dad by saying Trump would be a great president almost 20 years ago. Turns out, I was right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yogibear951 How about the fact it's on Q day from 9-11?? Coincidence??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ExpectingRain_ And after negotiations, it turns out it's an 8 x 8 room with no windows and only two meals a day...only for the DS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PepeDurham Paul Manafort??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guarnaccia11 It sounds like you have nailed exactly what the values of the Democratic Party are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@loganclarkhall @RichardGrenell Hypocrisy is under a microscope and these liars are being exposed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaredlholt Bet you'll get a similar reaction to when the leftist idiots tried to cancel Goya.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elenochle Still funny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I see a list like this it makes me wonder if #Democrats are just brainwashed or if they want the things in blue.  Is the hatred for #Trump so strong from #Liberals they will support anything to win?  Maybe there aren't that many ppl for #Biden and they are just really loud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MyTimeNow5 @JoshCam01989065 Yes, you are correct. Most people don't pay attention or care about what they put in and on their body.   I think shedding light on this, whether through specific diets or just general info is vital.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @SpeakerPelosi More and more people are catching on to your drunken lies. The gig is up and you're going to jail soon!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cjtruth New prescription for viagra??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheHappyPriest Lol I just went thru that and was begging for a new follower the second I saw it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hoosiers1986 Nope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We act as if these things are so normal yet forget many of these things are very new.   It has been a slow methodical movement towards the complete destruction of the family unit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When did it become so important for women to put career before family?  When did it become unacceptable for a couple under 25 to get married without everyone telling them they are too young?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When did single-parent households skyrocket?  How long ago did the movement of letting TV/screens raise children start?  When did large amounts of parents stop teaching basic skills like cooking and doing laundry?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How long had it been normal fir both parents to work full-time jobs?  When did divorce become so normal and easy?  How long has public education been around in its' current form?  When did it become normal for TV/Movies to portray casual sex as common/accepted?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Slow infiltration of satan has lulled manying into thinking today's society is just how it's supposed to be.   Here are a few questions I think everybody should ask and research...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Warren39503025 Start with the 4 Gospels and read them until it makes sense. Then, move on to the 13 letters written by St. Paul in the New Testament. Just my opinion and as a beginner, I wouldn't get too hung up on the specific version.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReadMoreBible Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MyTimeNow5 @JoshCam01989065 No. I have none of those issues at all.   I've been there before ( both vegan and fruitarian). Neither is how humans are designed to eat. Of course, we also aren't designed to eat meat for every meal either.  Everybody is different and should do what works for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevBoat44 @atvguy It might be time to put Trump in a bunker and take out the deep state.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toyotabry True. Just hate seeing that number. Lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Seymour_Truth_ Totally get that. Some days it's so confusing it gives me a headache.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SOMEONE FOLLOW ME FAST!   I AM STUCK ON AN UNSAVORY NUMBER!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boy did this video really woke me up. Whew, I almost voted for a President that doesn't support and promote the satanic sacrifice of the most innocent lives. Glad I dodged that bullet.  🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScotFreeman1776 So if you're EXTREMELY MODERATE as you claim to be, how in the world could you possibly vote for Biden/Harris? If you won't vote for Trump, who's left?  Biden - Adopted Bernie Sanders Far-Left Agenda Harris - Most Far-Left VP pick EVER for the Dem Party<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@86Thornton Boy did this video really woke me up. Whew, I almost voted for a President that doesn't support and promote the satanic sacrifice of the most innocent lives. Glad I dodged that bullet.  🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I Guarantee 99% of these idiots are #Democrats and let at least one #MSM news network brainwash them regularly.  The #DemocraticParty is the party of Hypocracy, lunacy, and narrative only. Wonder how much Soros paid these idiots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamanthaM_NoH8 @JoeBiden Hope you're super patient. Biden has no chance and Harris was a horrible choice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watched it today. It's worth a look for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RwayTwibbitts Hopefully and hopefully forever, but probably not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This will be a complete waste of time considering both were complete hoaxes and we all know it. If you look past the MSM garbage and look at raw footage of each incident, you'll see how they lie, lie, lie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donaldherring11 All those so-called trucks are staged. Many have debunked this and shown those trucks are empty. They tried to pull the same shit in NYC and other areas and it has all been debunked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden 😁🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 BULLSHIT  If I actually thought this was Joe and not some staffer, I would simply tell people to look up the many lies Joe has told over the years. Look up Joe circa 1988, and then realize the guy has never changed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@josh_hammer You know it's trouble for Biden when the fake polls start reporting the race getting tighter. I bet it's really about Trump 65, Biden 30, Write-in 5.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Acosta Those numbers aren't even close. I bet if there had never been a financial incentive for medical facilities to mark a death as COVID that number would be chopped in half, if not even further.  Cases are not actual cases. They are cases + probable cases. Inflated FAKE NEWS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donaldherring11 She must have gone on a bender and came up with this grand idea. Another waste of tax dollars.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Seymour_Truth_ I have felt that way once a week since March. Technically I woke up a little bit four or five years ago, but a bigger awakening came about 18 months ago, but had no time to really look into things.  March, I started researching and feel just like you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously, this is trending #BidenSchoolsTrump.  #Biden doesn't even know what a School is anymore.  The #DemocraticParty is the party of Paid For Science that fits their specific agenda/narrative.   #WakeUpAmerica they think you're stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeAnna4Congress This is 100% HORRIFIC and the article is under The Good Stuff...really? This is about as bad as it gets and from DISNEY.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@undercoverpat1 Wife and I both sick in January, probably COVID and nothing since other than symptoms from any time we have to wear stupid masks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MyTimeNow5 @JoshCam01989065 I've never pooped out meat or grains, so I'm pretty sure my body digests it just fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrShayPhD The wolves are quickly shedding thier sheep's clothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eli_Z12 @4YrsToday As usual. No research, just deciding what you're told by MSM is true. No common sense. Always living on the surface.   One day you'll wake up and the shock of truth will likely knock you on your ass...or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CatholicTwitter...this poser is the EXACT definition of a WOLF.  The #Catholic Church is splitting. You're either with Christ or against Christ. Satan owns the fence.  Don't be fooled by these Wolves in Sheep's clothing promoting anti-Catholic beliefs at every turn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesMartinSJ You are not a priest or a Catholic. WOLF WOLF WOLF!!  YES, IT IS 100% A SIN TO VOTE FOR BABY MURDERERS.   Keep voting for these demons and you'll find your final judgement is rather firey.   Repent and change your ways.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepJimmyGomez @realDonaldTrump What will you think when you find yourself on the wrong side of history?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalbertSwan You're a demon. Evil evil evil wolf dressing in sheep's clothing.  Repent!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BernardKerik @realDonaldTrump Biden did. Only one I've seen tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RightOh1995 In the USA, if those were the numbers We would have 3,165 CV19 deaths, 0 stroke deaths, 0 heart attack deaths, and 39 murders.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dixiedelight87 @POTUS WrongTrump...started trending hours after.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorBennet @USPS Where's your proof? Why do ppl fall for these lies?  Who lost the ability to rig their voting machines? Who has been pushing hard for mail-in voting?  Who actually stands to gain the most from a mail in voting system like what Cali has?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@donaldherring11 I gave up debating them.  I just ask a few on-topic questions I know they can't answer and move on.  Then I pretend I can see the dumb look on their face because CNN hasn't told them how to respond.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Angela17Patriot And my gosh is it showing right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Capt17Bjk @4YrsToday Compassion is lost on you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jasperlest @4YrsToday Have you ever heard one press conference from President Trump?  Do have any idea where most of those deaths happened and why?  Do your own research. Your MSM talking points are pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eli_Z12 @4YrsToday Who blocked travel from China, and then Europe, and when?  Who danced in Chinatown and when?  Who deployed hospitals and staff to hot zones?

<|startoftext|>@marklevinshow Voting in person shouldn't be a problem. If you're that worried, vote early when barely anyone is there.  Mail in voting is for those thag don't care how their vote is counted.  In-person voting with valid ID is common sense.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Daub14B @EaglesWingsQ While I certainly agree, I have heard the general public will only end up knowing about 20% of it. I think if the gen pop knew it all, a lot of ppl couldn't handle it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MandyCrisner @GeorgePapa19 Nobody should accept the so-called "New Normal". It's not necessary and it's all just fear-mongering BS. Of course, that's only the belief of those of us doing the research and seeing first-hand how ridiculous some of this crap is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If they can show up to protest, they can go to a VOTING BOOTH with a FRIKIN line and vote.   These people have absolutely no sense whatsoever. It's a zombie apocalypse of almost dead idiots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulRebuked Keep telling yourself that you. The Catholic church takes $$ from the govt and does what they say. Many many wolves in sheep's clothing.

<|startoftext|>Pay attention and get prepared. Even if you think it's nuts, if something happens you'll be glad you were ready.  6+ mos food Cooking supplies Candles Flashlights Heat source Etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawnCurto @familyman20181 @mil_ops @LindaThunderUp If you can yes. If not, think more primitive. Fire building supplies, gas canisters for camp cooking set ups. Anything for food cooking and heat if you're in a colder area.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillKristol So shocking you'd say that. Every single conservative on planet Earth saw this shit coming. Biden can't hide forever and even dems are catching on to his weak bs.  Pence would wipe the floor with heels up anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  And now we know your a puppet.  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDailyWire I'd never shop at a store pulling this shit. This sounds like a discrimination lawsuit should be fired.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMattCouch Yea another look to laugh again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good try. Most of us can see right through your BS. #CatholicTwitter don't' fall for this garbage. #JoeBiden isn't a #Catholic. He will do anything and say anything for votes.   Plus, he just chose one of the most Anti-Catholic people in the world for is VP. #DemsAreCorrupt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@speakeasypublic @StefMLozinski So, how about we take one thing you did in the past and assume you can't grow or change ever. Then, let's let that one bad thing define the rest of your life as we judge you by it, not your more recent actions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kellytx2 @RealMattCouch I count 26 ppl in that "crowd".  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fact check: you're not a doctor  Fact check: you are responsible for thousands of nursing home murders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  They just told us exactly what the dems plan to do. Always with the projection.  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDailyWire The mouthpiece isn't getting his adrenochrome so he's falling apart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bellasbane_ @ana_milan999 @BishopBarron That won't last. I think the pedo stuff will spread through many mega-churches and several also took huge PPP loans, which opens them up to audits.  I am guessing by this time next year we will see quite a few big churches fall.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kate_awakening Same, it takes me directly to joebiden dot com. This is pretty telling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrAtheistPants Go back and listen to the context with the things making you think Trump is a crook and you'll be even more upset as you uncover each lie you've been fed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Qanon76 @QINCIDENCES Time to report these aholes and block them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If they don't want to be American, then deport them. I hear China is very communist this time of year.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Once again #CatholicTwitter &amp; #ChristianTwitter #JoeBiden has proven time &amp; time again that he's a FAKE CATHOLIC.  The man is closer to satan than Jesus.

<|startoftext|>Bullshit and you either know it or you're one of the WOLVES. The church has been infiltrated for decades and Vat. II is a part of how it's being destroyed.  You are either a part of the destruction or a coward. Either way, you're not for Christ.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BishopBarron Let me just add, since Vat.2 the Catholic church loses 6 members per every 1 conversion, which doesn't add up considering other Christian churches grew exponentially over the same time.  Vat. 2 has done nothing good for evangelical vigor.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BlayneLannan1 I'd be surprised if less than 75% are involved in one way or another. My best guess is maybe 10% avoided it altogether, another 20% were victims as kids b4 becoming actors, and maybe another 20% were involved but never raped a kid.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MercyOnWe @tcproductions2 Ummm....God uses people for his message all the time. He may not NEED Trump, but He can certainly use him and is using him.  Recognizing and instrument of Christ isn't making them a master.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NOTRealNewsNow I think I'm headed that way too. Shared some child traffucking stuff today after a heated convo about COVID and masks. Git crickets.  They are brainwashed leftist and think voting for Dems is Christian so I'm sure we won't be on speaking terms much longer.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealMattCouch If she does she will become enemy number one. Masks are a form of submission and Satan loves it when we cover our image of God. She works for Satan so it's not surprising.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It just keeps getting worse. Trying to suck it up to let my wife have some fun away from the house, but every customer service experience at @WaltDisneyWorld has been terrible.  Employees don't know what they are doing and you can't easily communicate thru masks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanHoranOFM So voting for those mass murdering the most innocent is Christian?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@entirelybonker6 @SSG_PAIN @BarbaraZajicek Very true. Good point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@entirelybonker6 @SSG_PAIN @BarbaraZajicek Yea I'm preparing myself and my wife for anybody and everybody just in case.   I also think there will be several in pedowood wrapped up in it bc they were victims as children.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Truth is both @UniversalORL and @SeaWorld are kicking you're behind right now because they aren't psychotic and actually like their passholders.  #DisneyWorld I am thoroughly disappointed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Keep this 💩 up Disney and you'll be a shell of what you once were. Passholders are walking away and your arrogant boss thinks we will come back, but we won't.  Never thought I'd have to write negative things about a company that used to have such great service.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It has become so bad I won't be renewing my annual pass. I'm done with the absolute rude &amp; ridiculous way they treat humans all bc of masks that are going to cause more harm than good.  I hope a massive class action lawsuit comes about after the way they've decided to treat APs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WaltDisneyWorld is no longer an enjoyable experience. Used to be magical &amp; fun. Now, they literally have employees going around looking for a reason to destroy your day.   Can't drink water while your walking, not even a few feet while waiting in line.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rlwolff9 @JCAP201 @NumbersMuncher @benshapiro Yes because the @HuffPost is a trustworthy news outlet 🙄. Typical #Democrat resorting to name-calling and spreading agenda-laden news outlet garbage. It's never civil with #Democrats .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YAAS_America @johncardillo These are terrorist that should be labeled as such and arrested. I'd gladly trade ever American citzen that hates this country for an immigrant looking to make America thier home and actually contribute to society. #AntifaTerrorists destroy, they don't contribute.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rlwolff9 @JCAP201 @NumbersMuncher @benshapiro It's all coming out and many districts have reported hundreds of thousands of illegal votes. Voter fraud is very real, not an excuse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rlwolff9 @JCAP201 @NumbersMuncher @benshapiro We will c. That number wouldn't be so high if illegals weren't voting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne I started around 8 at a local golf course. Work is empowering!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DEMONcrats have been preying on the poor for over a century. @realDonaldTrump must win in 2020 or this country will fall apart and there will only be rich and poor left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a blatant lie and another term used to confuse the masses. "Weapons of War" can be stretched to mean ALL guns if #Democrats want, and they do want. I bet @MorningConsult surveyed a bunch of ppl at an anti-gun rally to get their numbers too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If it were up to #DEMONcrats like @RashidaTlaib everything they disagree with, whether good or evil, would be boycotted. In today's world #boycotting means nothing because it's just a weekly or daily changing trend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StefanMolyneux Sex should be reserved for marriage. Build other, more important foundations, such as spiritual, emotional, and intellectual. Let the physical wait or you'll likely end up in a rather shallow relationship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mitchellvii Fix the root cause instead of going after the tool used. Strengthen families, stop putting ppl on drugs as a default for mental illness, and drain the horrific media swamp that glorifies mass shootings and uses these tragedies for political gain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WalshFreedom You're mistaken. The liars and bullies are all democrats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mitchellvii Yet so many news outlets want to scare us from goung out into public by telling us mass shootings are super common.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This should be an arrestable offense. Let's trade all those that hate America yet benefit from our country for those actually trying to come here legally. 1 for 1, even trade.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanCrenshawTX His numbers are made up anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LifeNewsHQ Stopped buying them a while ago!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patton6966 All she does is pander. Democrats are basically sold to the highest bidder over and over again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichardGrenell @chadfelixg Lock em up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here Robert Francis @BetoORourke goes again spreading lies with nothing to back up his figures. Pathetic and desperate for attention.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NumbersMuncher @benshapiro These polls aren't exactly trustworthy, in today's world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nytimes Another BS article from a fake news outlet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom @senatemajldr This is complete bs and it's the media that makes mass shooting seem so common. When you don't lump in gang violence to fit your ridiculous gun control narrative your chances of getting shot in a mass shooting are about the same as getting struck by lightning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BernieSanders You're too i late to the party and you used to say "millionaires" until your payoffs bought you another house.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnBrennan I didn't know actually following thru on campaign promises was a stain. Must feel that way since no democrat ever has kept a single promise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ANTIFA_Portland If you hat this country so much LEAVE!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrewkimmel Looks like you are the one trying to set tge narrative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElectricSoup87 @MattWalshBlog  https://t.co/ulsdE7CxPi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brilliant  https://t.co/pIwtn9qtf5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DLoesch Those on the left always go to name-calling. That's akin to third graders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funny, many of @BernieSanders policies are more in line with Hitler's than @realDonaldTrump policies. What a power-hungry selfish tw*t!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep. This about sums it up.   https://t.co/U4wVlGFhoB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LifeNewsHQ Nothing safe about murder!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarrellWest1984 These are probably pictures from hours before. Pathetic ploy to make @realDonaldTrump look bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet you drive around the country in a huge gas guzzling bus. Hypocrisy from @SenKamalaHarris as usual.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jesus_porvida Socialist policies kill small business.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vodaeau @MattWalshBlog Do your research. More than 90% of scientists agree, life begins at conception. Calling an unborn baby "cells' or anything but a baby is how baby murderers rationalize their horrible sin. Much easier to admit the truth and ask for forgiveness than continue spreading lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frfrankpavone @SenWarren Shes a wolf trying to wear sheep's clothing, but most of us can see that grey fur sticking out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@okcupid There's nothing Reproductive about murder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShelDiehl @MattWalshBlog No real man would EVER ask a woman to put garbage into her body known as Birth Control. Real men trust God and wait for marriage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarackObama started these policies and @realDonaldTrump had to beg for funding to make it even a little better, which #democrats didn't want to give. Let that sink in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PreetBharara @Serpentsrose I hope roe is gone and so is choice. Nobody should have the choice to murder the innocent. Abortion is the agenda of Satan and those too brainwashed or evil to see the truth about human life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Obviously this guy @funder isn't smart enough to see the truth. @realDonaldTrump just broke the record held by @eltonofficial in New Hampshire. If it was anything like the rally in my city, there were 10k ppl that didn't get in watching from outside.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@garyrextanner @Recook63Russell That's because the only thing a #socialist aka a #democrat cares about is themselves. They closk tgeir selfishness in forced charity for power and control.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LifeNewsHQ Every time someone refuses an abortion an angel gets it's wings 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDailyWire Yep just reset what 0 means.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Christians aren't responsible for what foster parents do nor are we responsible for parents deciding to break the law by trying cross the border illegally. Blaming an entire group of people for the actions of a few is a tired #democratic tactic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Along with America, White people, and Freedom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealSaavedra Just a democratic puppet spouting off before he inevitably announces he's dropping out of the race.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMattCouch Please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mitchellvii And he's got to deal with an entire party of crazy uncles called the Democrats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the racist bigot claims she's fighting exactly what she is. Worst member of congress ever!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EnergyPS Remove carbon dioxide and watch those trees die you idiots! This isn't science its manipulation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing false about it. #democrats support killing babies across the board. Maybe you @atrupar should actually do your job and report facts not spin for your sick and evil agenda you paid of puppet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog Birth control isn't healthcare anyway. Its unnatural garbage destroying women slowly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog I pay more to have a pizza delivered than to pick it up. Should I boycott?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 Joe needed a couple days to send out 1 tweet in between several naps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden By that logic the USA should stop trying to keep ISIS members out of our country. You're certainly not what this country needs. Go take a nap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidhogg111 Yea showing and ID and providing a signature is so difficult. What a crock of sh**.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog Yea showing and ID and providing a signature is so difficult. What a crock of sh**.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BetoORourke The threat we need to wake up to is the socialist agenda od democrats responsible for all the racism and hate spreading throughout our country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkDice They should already be illegal!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great interview so far. Everyone on the #left (#democrats ) and the #right (#republicans ) should read this.   https://t.co/U7dykq33XB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @POTUS He's just butt hurt cause he's not President. Plus demslike to buy off those with stagnant political careers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LifeNewsHQ Not really breaking, more of expected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SaraCarterDC @Scaramucci Fake news and  democrat's wet dream.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ewarren @IlhanMN @RashidaTlaib Political views? Its not a difference of opinion when soneone outright HATES a group of people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamAdlerBell This from a freelance writer. Really? Can't you come up with something better than name-calling? Must be jealous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BetoORourke (Robert Francis) Some of us have also suggested you stop wasting your time with a fake name and a terrible campaign, but you silver-spoon-fed idiots never listen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gun laws won't solve this issue and we all know #Democrats prefera scared population.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenKamalaHarris When will you and all the #DEMONcrats wake-up and realize gun laws won't solve this problem? Most Americans are not walking around in a panic because we are smart enough to know the chances of getting killed in a mass shooting are about the same as being struck by lightning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ilhan I don't want you or anybody else in the government deciding my healthcare. Healthcare for all is a complete joke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By the end of tomorrow, this will somehow be @realDonaldTrump 's fault if @BetoORourke (aka Robert Francis) can find a way to spin the narrative to fit his political agenda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump This is the kind of garbage very desperate politicians (@JulianCastro ) feeling thier power slip away produce. Pathetic how the #DEMONcrats take anything they can, even tragedy and spin it for political gain. Pure evil!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well said. Describes a #DEMONcrats wet dream.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog @Twitter Done<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Obviously, @MattOrtega has no idea how to listen to the words spoken. He hears what he wants, not what issaid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's wasting his time anyway. Booker has no chance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaeljknowles I'm still trying to figure out how such an idiot (@AOC) got elected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I Agree too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mollyfprince @benshapiro Arrest everyone that threw something at the cops!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JulianCastro Your word have no meaning since you only care about your own agenda. Empty politician.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timjacobwise Most of us welcome LEGAL immigrants with open arms, you snd your lefist friends love to lump ILLEGAL and LEGAL immigrants into one category and spew your racism at us. Maybe one day you'll wake up and realize ILLEGAL aliens are criminal by definition &amp; don't help our economy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HixsonButch @DLoesch Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamPrince8 @MsBlaireWhite @BernieSanders And what's your point?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Benjami64882198 @BernieSanders Yep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BernieSanders From where I stand, you are the coward counting on illegal aliens to vote for you. This is the most moronic thing I've seen you say and that's saying something. You must be getting rather desperate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay, so I follow #conservatives for the most part yet these are the @Twitter recommendations given to me when I go to @realDonaldTrump ! I find it rather odd.  https://t.co/QU7KTwCEPr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDailyWire Just another Hollywood crazy probably doing too many drugs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DLoesch His reset should be going back to whatever he did before he tried out politics and failed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog They must have been spooning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KHodgess Been on both sides of this in my life and I encourage you to read the bible in full without the strong protestant influence eliminating so many essential things Jesus speaks about. I also encourage you to read the writings of the early church fathers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan You must be deaf dumb and blind to believe this....or just evil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Murder, it's a Democrat thing  https://t.co/434s6FXawi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely dead on. Nail meet Hammer. Time for ALL #Christians to stand up to #evil #Progressives And all other forms of evil. Satan doesn't get to win no matter what #DEMONcrats say.  Resurgence of old-school courageous Americans  https://t.co/eGRrBTPlWx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@catholicjose Prayers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Obama also deported more than 3 million ppl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ewarren Actually, it would cause the wealthy to cut jobs and/or raise prices. It amazes me how people fall for this socialist garbage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RL9631 @Recook63Russell Good riddance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickjojo @charliekirk11 You know as well as I do I was referring to those running for the Democratic nomination.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well said! #NationOfSettlers    https://t.co/lcK1IGnBhm<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> https://t.co/J9odYxEGrN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BernieSanders That's the smartest thing you have to say? Pathetic just like your socialist ideas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickjojo @charliekirk11 That depends how far left you lean. I was referring more to the so-called left leaders of this country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrAndyNgo @Recook63Russell Sick and twisted evil<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@roseOyuma1 @sistervpaul_ @EdIsBackKAG2020 @DrSueDVM @ToupsFamily @1207go @guatemayabyesi @Matthew82060400 @Lampasvlad @judysix6 @PrayHard972 Biden is a FAKE Catholic. Nothing real about his faith and his actions have proved that time and time again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJack Maybe if we can keep these women alive the Clintons will finally go down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamVTV Yep its a fishy one again connected to the name Clinton.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This right here is a Clinton puppet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SethAbramson We are not bots. Just smart enough to connect the dots. Anybody that has info on the Clintons ends up dead. Wake up you tool!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump TRUTH!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeTakei Happens all the time here as soon as you have something on a Clinton.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CardinalNapier @CBSNews If their parent didn't break the law and came here legally this wouldn't happen. I have compassion for the children, of course, but any blame must go to the parents. ALL criminal parents are seperated from thier children, not just illegal aliens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDailyWire More accurately, the Clintons killed Jeffrey making it look like a suicide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mitchellvii Just don't mention the Clintons or you'll probably end up dead by "suicide" too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMattCouch Evil Clintons...most prolific serial killers of today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 Those teaching illegal aliens how to get away with their crime should be in jail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheOfficerTatum Its so very obvious. They are evils and have far too much power. Clintons are serial killers and the cartel of Satan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patton6966 Clintons strike again. Why this shocks ppl is beyond me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog With the rope or bed sheet or shoelaces provided by the Clintons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 90% of Dems are frauds. They just shined the spotlight on themselves to much and got caught.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealSaavedra For the Clintons? When will ppl wale up and connect the dots? The moment Bill was mentioned we all should have seen the"suicide" coming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealSaavedra Only if Barr is connected to the Clintons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scrowder All orchestrated by the evil Clintons of course. One more name on their kill list crossed off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog Yeo. Any time the Clintons could go down for something someone ends up dead. They are the spawn of Satan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johncardillo @RealMattCouch Right up there with Safe, Legal, and Rare.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonahNRO @benshapiro Well she's a fake, lying democrat so probably take 15.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BuckSexton @RealMattCouch All she does is lie. Another power-hungry democrat that will do anything for more power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickjojo @charliekirk11 Never said he was, but I'll take a flawed human over the demons on the left every day of the week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wilxTV @browneyebabe25 Good because guns aren't the problem. Just like tools don't build houses guns don't kill people. The problem is much deeper.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RationalBeing @StefanMolyneux So intelligent and rational 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMattCouch Socialist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMattCouch Racist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SassyTallBlonde Agenda pushing, power-hungry, hateful, dividers are those who lean so far left they exploit and destroy innocence for personal gain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ewarren Because you're bought and paid for by those pulling your evil strings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog Heck, I feel like they get whatever they want and everyone else has to bend to their tantrums. Taylor Swift is just proving she's a Hollywood puppet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abhabhattarai @browneyebabe25 @GregBensinger Of course, they were in California. The state is basically becoming a socilist dream and its rather scary. Guns arenot the reason for mass shootings. That would be like a carpenter blaming his tools for bad workmanship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNNBusiness @browneyebabe25 Here we go with another ridiculous socialist-led ploy to make guns the problem. Look deeper and you'll discover mass shooting are the the fault of guns. Far more at play.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slpng_giants @Nestle Who cares. @Nestle products are mostly garbage anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog Her worry about white racism is racism against white people, but of course the left doesn't believe anybody other than white people can be racist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 He's a democrat so not surprised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonSteidl It is a big deal and not seeing it as such is an even bigger deal. Nobody really knows how well anybody not seeing the full presence has gotten along except by earthly standards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrHilderbrand An "illegal alien" is by definition a criminal and loses certain constitutional rights. So this statement is false.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benshapiro They always resort to "white supremacist" or "racist" when they know their argument is weak and pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDailyWire Sold soul in need of an exorcism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DineshDSouza She's gonna eat in a foster home just like the kids of all the other horrible parents breaking the law.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealSaavedra Are any of the democrats not insane?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johncardillo @BetoORourke Power hungry hypocrite with a fake name.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera They broke the law Mr. Fake News. They are not immigrants. They are illegal aliens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or maybe these sad souls haven't faced the reality of KILLING yet. I can personally attest when they wake up to the heinous sin they committed the guilt will crush them.  Pray for ALL these killers as they need it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aSciEnthusiast @realDonaldTrump Blanket and misguided statement. You must be a fan of CNN.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMattCouch @realDonaldTrump Hmmmm he seems like a sane choice to protect the freedom of the people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@prominentplay @JohnJHarwood Yet....besides killing isn't a prerequisite for a hate group.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoArquette @JohnJHarwood @Amusedandhappy They are terrorist and the EXACT definition of a HATE group...you must be a member to make such a comment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog Doesn't even sound harsh because it's just truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlueKarlaCampos Welcome to the right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BetoORourke @BetoORourke is a failed hack that had to change his name for even a sliver of relevance. Only desperate leeches use tragedy for political gain. Pathetic and shameful!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@akkitwts Not true and I don't miss them one bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greg_price11 @DLoesch Sounds like @JoeNBC is jealous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DLoesch @BetoORourke or as some know him Robert, is really open to anything that might help him poll higher that a couple percent. He's a desperate tool looking for attention.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog This kind of high school garbage is a waste of time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMaxineWaters Once someone actually defines an assault weapon we can actually talk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HeyTammyBruce @RealSaavedra Exactly. Anthing that happens in this country gets blamed on @realDonaldTrump or gets ignored if the media can't blame him. It's pathetic and so is her apology.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkDice @NicolleDWallace Kinda an empty apology considering she found a way to attack @POTUS in the same message. Guess you have to take what you can get tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SassyTallBlonde Hmmmmm....looks like she grabbed something alright.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StefanMolyneux There are obviously a bunch of brainwashed ppl out there that only hear/read what they want. It amazes me how ppl are so quickvto assume.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@texasrockguy @charliekirk11 You also assumed Im hateful yet your language matches far more with a person spreading hatred, so questioning your beliefs seems ratger warranted. Maybe if you didn't say "I'm Christian" here's some hate, I would actually know you're a follower of Christ.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@texasrockguy @charliekirk11 And nobody knows what your comment has to do with the coversation. Calling out someone running for president for their ridiculous crap isn't hate. I don't hate anybody but disagree with many. Big difference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chuckwoolery Stolen money buys expensive artwork. Probably purchased with all the cash he was given to make his district actually livable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DineshDSouza Probably because they don't understand how business works and people are wising up to their crap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heckyessica Depends on who has the treats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AsheSchow She doesn't even matter in the primary anyway.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MatthewHumphr04 @charliekirk11 One supports the mass murder of the most innocent of humans for selfishness and convenience, along with open borders. The other has worked very hard to protect life and secure the borders. Not the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DmlfFranssen @charliekirk11 Exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SaintJimiC @charliekirk11 Pretty sure you're not a saint. I didn't say Trump was perfect, great, or anything like that. I said Pete is a fake Christian. Big difference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bjosep @charliekirk11 Break the law and separation from your children is to be expected. Support a democrat and support the mass murder of children. Not to mention, "kids locked in cages" was started by Obama.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@texasrockguy @charliekirk11 You sure sound like a Christian. Bet you support baby murder too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sockeye6 @charliekirk11 By that logic we are all the anti-christ unless you really believe you've lived without sinning.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @kenna0906 @realDonaldTrump All 4 would gladly destroy our country for power. They work for Satan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robertrarce @RealSaavedra If you point it out you're racist, according to dems, so by their logic ( which isn't even close to logic) yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisRBarron Only if you are President Trump. Don't dare call a democrat racist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scrowder They are so blind, deaf, dumb, and desperate. Anybody with half a brain can see the truth.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Don't forget Los Angeles and San Francisco...democrat leaders usually lead to more poverty yet the poorer people in our country keep voting for these morons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really? I don't think a racist would even call this out. He'd just let it go and continue to get worse. Calling attention to it helps potentially start a conversation to solve the issue.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Beau_Walker @ChuckWagner1993 @realDailyWire Yep and @AOC will have more bartending experience tgan government experience after the next election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@djbrommer @realDailyWire They arent funny enough to enjoy such a good company.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DYHAparrot @realDailyWire Ditto<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This statement is incredibly racist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sairasameerarao That statement is racist. Those of color don't own discrimination and racist claim. It goes both ways and right now, you are showing how racist people are against white people. You represent the problem, not the solution.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SassyTallBlonde Typically experience in any field means pay raises and better job security, so yes, experience pays the bills. She will find out when she's not re-elected and has to depend on her bartending experience again.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RepCummings You can't just make things up and call it trth, but who's surprised since that's what 95% of democrats fo these days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 Just for good measure let's throw "The Squad" in there and squash that bug too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DLoesch @MrAndyNgo And @PeteButtigieg based on your running of a city we should trust you? That's like trusting a 2-year-old to wipe their own a**.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DineshDSouza @yaf That's just called business.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Recook63Russell @Susan_Hennessey @TheDemocrats Evil never stops even when it becomes insanely obvious how wrong they are. I'm hoping some law firm will file a class action suit against every lying leftist in the media and in government that just wasted $50 million tax payer dollars. Make them pay for it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Susan_Hennessey This right here just shows how blind and ridiculously deaf dems are....oh wait, I meant to say evil and selfish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darrengrimes_ We've all had these moments, days, heck years. I appreciate your post!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DLoesch All the lying dems wasted the money of Americans. When will the class action lawsuit be filed to ensure these lying leftist pay us back?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan Desperation leads to mistakes and many will wish they hadn't wasted their time. Can the elected please get back to the job us tax payers are writing checks for and serve the AMERICAN people?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheJaredMonroe Or he won't survive the terrorist group call his family.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@johncardillo @AdamSchiff Evil @AdamSchiff is protected by the deep state, power hungry democrats that are, at best, like a guy in a bar saying whatever a woman wants to hear just for a few minutes of pleasure.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RubinReport Funny, I'm a white man and she scares me more than a gang of thugs with crowbars in a dark alley.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr Shocker. I have never seen someone with such a mouth and so little action to back it up. She's horrific for this country.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 @AOC She isn't legally allowed to block you as a public figure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's also important to stand ul to luke warm Christians trying to make it okay to sin because of grace. God's grace isn't a free pass to "do what thou wilt". That comes from satan. We must repent to gain forgiveness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luke_parker777 Yep and its probably not far from the truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog @trustednerd @Twitter Absolutely appalling. This person needs an exorcism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scrowder Sick and twisted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marklutchman She won't even be the dem nominee.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WayneDupreeShow 100% power hungy communist out to destroy America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luke_parker777 Dead on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrumpWarRoom What you mean she should to the job she was elected to do? What a concept!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDailyWire Make it a million dollars and hour. Doesn't matter as all it doesis redefine zero. My first job paid me minimum wage when it was $4.25 per hour. Gas was $0.72 per gallon and milk about $1 a gallon. Now, min wage is $7.25 and gas is over $2.50 with milk close to $3.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not to mention Warren wants to destroy the economy, too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh so dead on! Even dems in my family threatened to leave. Maybe we can just create the socialist country of California and let the dems have it. Then, we can all move on to a better USA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scrowder It's sick, twisted, and directly from Satan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RachelTheDreg @jimaggie93 @SpeakerPelosi Trying to destroy America...they only care about power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog Took all of 24 hours for this to become false and politically motivated dribble.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@livingforjc Amen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marklutchman Yes please. Out with the redheaded grinch. How she got labeled as a comedian is beyond me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog How dare he spend time with his family before his job starts. People are ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottFordTVGuy Stay strong. Not all of us are hateful towards people that don't have the same views. Maybe if more people looked at the policies instead of the media-assigned labels we could actually have a reasonable conversation about things that actually matter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 Bernie knows a $15 minumum wage would destroy small businesses and simply doesn't care. He just want as much power as he can steal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bishopoftyler Connected directly to satan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog You don't have to teach little boys to run, climb, and do other active things, just as you don't have to teach little girls to want a baby doll. Its in their nature. Those trying to make the 1% exception reality are the ones indoctrinating children.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan And blame those actually at fault.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DineshDSouza EXACTLY! Nobody caredwhen Obama did his evil bidding and now Trump is being blamed for all of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LionelMedia I highly doubt this was a non-bias, accurate poll. Probably surveyed her family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog Thats because people on the left are nut cases that think everything has to be an absolute without a single exception to the norm. If there is an exception, they make it out to be the norm, even when it's incredibly rare.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kidsthesedayz @charliekirk11 Businesses are designed to make a profit and all overhead, including wages, has to be calculated into the cost of the service/product provided. Increased wages mean either cutting jobs or raising prices for small businesses. Remember, large corps are only one impacted biz.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kidsthesedayz @charliekirk11 That's not how business works and it never has been.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 Exactly correct!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@weijia The difference - the first lady doesn't HATE America!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 The fact that our president gets harrassed non stop as racist is racist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scrowder Equal has always been the problem with the equation. They want to be put on a pedistal not earn anything on true fairness and merit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenKing Youd be very mistaken to think the majority agree withvthis garbage statement. His actions and policies are as far racist as it gets and to call our president racist only comes from cowardice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scrowder @CNN @MrAndyNgo No surprise. @CNN is filled with dirty Antifa puppets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scrowder @shaunking it takes a complete fool to make such ridiculous statements.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RubinReport The word "left" and "hate" are rather interchangeable these days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealDeanCain Typically those calling others racist and using attack mode as their default are the true racists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 Raising the minimum wage only devalues the dollars of everyone making more than the minimum wage. It doesn't make any sense as $15 per hour won't increase the buying power. It will cause job loss and higher prices for all goods and services.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC Those making accusations are the ones needing to look in the mirror.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frfrankpavone Exactly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scrowder Am I the only one that thinks "maintenance hole" sounds dirty?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanCrenshawTX It's actually pretty simple. The left doesn't want equality. They want white men oppressed. One day maybe we will all wake up and realize a truly non-racist, non-sexist society wouldn't see color or gender, but merit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cacollier77 @BobbyMcDonagh1 @JamesMartinSJ Typical bs response<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosemary_G3 @JamieBeaman @JamesMartinSJ Christ called plenty of Pharisees wicked because they didn't follow His word. It's not that I don't agree. It's that the Bible doesn't agree, nor does the foundation of the Catholic Church.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlabamaHannah Sometimes, we spend so much time rationalizing our sin by attacking others that we refuse to admit (humble ourselves) our own sin. Pride loves to deflect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luke_parker777 @AlabamaHannah One must first recognize that sex outside if marriage is actually a sin. My guess, based on what I saw, @AlabamaHannah doesnt recognize her windmill sex as sin. You cannot repent and be forgiven without recognizing the sin. Yes Jesus still loves her, but sin weighs on the soul.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scrowder Not even close to okay with it. Disney is so particular about who they choose to be a princess at the theme parks, it makes no sense for a black person to put on white mask. We all know it would never fly if a white person was cast in a role for any other race.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And they try to paint him as Hitler.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 Thats because they don't believe in real police, only those they can control for evil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ToupsFamily Yes, it indeed is and abortion kills even more by making birth control seem like the better option — pure evil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet @AOC She should go back to bartending but I bet she was just as bad at that as being a politician. Still boggles my mind that people with brains voted for @AOC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VickieCouch Thats a start<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesMartinSJ Check out @realDailyWire’s Tweet:  https://t.co/5nWOPEN25Y Here's your context....STOP believing every word this heretic says. He's not a real priest, but one of Satans wolves in Sheep's clothing promised from the bible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Am_ussy @Valdimirkhobby It becomes a complete contradiction<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@XX7xluckydem0n @JamesMartinSJ He's not referring to every illegal immigrant as this horrific priest would have you believe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ImagesMD @JamesMartinSJ And it was ordered by God more than once in the Bible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donlav @JamesMartinSJ That comment is rooted in complete ignorance. President Trump is doing far more than Obama ever did for tge legal American people and the truly needy unborn babies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamieBeaman @JamesMartinSJ Yep and this wicked priest will be right there with those causing harm after illegally entering this country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FunkKpirnie @JamesMartinSJ He's done more for those in true need than any president in my lifetime.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BobbyMcDonagh1 @JamesMartinSJ Would you also go against David or Nehemiah from the Bible? We have every right to protect our borders, and that's biblical. Picking on a president standing up for unborn babies and the Americans that came here legally because of one word is what's pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeaksTruthNow @JamesMartinSJ Exactly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesMartinSJ Which has nothing to do with what he's talking about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesMartinSJ Read your Bible. Its sad to me that you parade around as a priest when you hang on one word instead of looking at tge entire situation. We have a right to protect our country from evil ppl doing evil things and that's in the Bible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, every human is a child of God, but when you're doing illegal evil things to hurt others it should be stopped. Bible talks about this many times. As a Priest, you should know the Bible, but anybody that pays attention to you knows its the Bible according to James Martin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WarriorsFake @AlanaWood333 Just saw the movie last night and loved it!!! It should be required viewing before ever casting another vote in this country.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@prageru @RealCandaceO @RubinReport Tragic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackPosobiec I agree. We ALL have similarities and we are all a part of the Body of Christ. Divided Satan wins. Together we win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealSaavedra @benshapiro Once again @AOC proves how dumb she is. Maybe they should fact check her everytime she opens her puppet mouth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckCallesto 🙋<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LifeNewsHQ No such thing as a true Christain that supports baby murder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC You have an odd sense of what winning is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HillaryClinton Fact Hilary Clinton belongs in jail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stacy Abrams obviously has no idea what evil is, but she will see it when she looks in the mirror.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDailyWire Alyssa Milano may love something more powerful than herself but it's not Christ.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good riddence to every one of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly. All a higher minimum wage does is devalue those of us not getting a raise due to government politics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnalive Not really sure what to think of this Pope these day. Certainly not the pope I would expect to be leading the Catholic Church. We must all be strong in faith and not be blindly led astray.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeanjeancrook @DLoesch Obviously, you don't worship Christ as your God or you'd know better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyCaller The Pope has some serious issues and isn't a true Catholic Pope. Be wary of believing what you hear from this one as he doesn't embrace true Catholicism.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Iamdevinnsmart @realDonaldTrump Right there with you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@benshapiro @AOC is a joke as a politician. She's a bought and paid for puppet and doesn't pull her own strings. Maybe she needs to go find a calling where she can actually think for herself instead of being the face for someone else's sick agenda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@catherinebh @OliverMcGee They only care about those people if they are here to make sure they get elected unconstitutionally. Sancuary cities help guaranteed #DEMINcrat candidates get elected.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JamesMartinSJ How about firing those that continue to miss the most on a basic teaching of Christ.

<|startoftext|>@marshal16954515 @robinshill105 @mgyllenhaal @caitrionambalfe Why do they have to be crack babies? Abortion happens to all kinds of babies, even those from mothers not smoking crack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Antifauxpas Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC How in the world did you get elected?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trishrd @mgyllenhaal @caitrionambalfe I know a father (me) who went through two and it still messes with me regularly. It's horrifying to think about and has caused more emotional trauma than anything else in my life. Nothing good comes from abortion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TigerDol @mgyllenhaal Nail on head....parents need to start parenting and stop trusting schools, nannies, and others to raise their children.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drahcir_rahl @mgyllenhaal What about the man that helped create tge child? Shouldn't he have rights to his own baby?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@miraclemiggs @mgyllenhaal Less government is almost always a good thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blackwhitezone @mgyllenhaal @caitrionambalfe Killing should never be more favorable, but the expectation for some perfect situation for every new life is ridiculous. Should we also murder kids if parents lose Jobs and all tge sudden don't have the same financial means?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lesley23P @marshal16954515 @robinshill105 @mgyllenhaal @caitrionambalfe We need to mind our business when a murder is happening? Really? Abortion is shear selfishness and those supporting it don't care about anything but evil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marshal16954515 @robinshill105 @mgyllenhaal @caitrionambalfe This is the most played out argument pro baby killers use. There are several programs from all types of churches in place for new moms, single moms, and those needing help. Just because the government sucks at taking care of ppl doesn't mean pro-lifers don't care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>100% agree. It's time for ALL Catholics to flee the democratic party or get very used hoping from the voting booth to the confessional.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bernie is a hack and needs to retire already.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shocker! You mean a lunatic that uses God to rationalize killing thousands did something else evil?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It seems that Satan is very prevalent in the state of New York<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump They are also the party of infanticide, abortion, and mostly anything evil<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump She would be such a bad president women would struggle to ever vote for another female president after. Corrupt Clintons belong behind bars.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LifeNewsHQ She's starting to say dumb things just like AOC. Have all #DEMONcrats gone stupid or is it just showing more this year?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ummmm....STOP voting for #babymurder you hypocrytical idiot @SenKamalaHarris<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_Sommerfeldt @AOC @NYDailyNews AOC continues to show how much of a puppet she is. This sounds a bit like a deep state warning/threat given through their favorite new mouthpiece. I am still amazed she was ever elected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McDonalds How about #TeamRealFood<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LifeNewsHQ Babies are now social problems according to these satanic lunatics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LifeNewsHQ She worships at the altar of satan and loves blood sacrifice. Satan turned her into the god she always wanted to be.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LifeNewsHQ Men stand up for what's right. Cowards kill babies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Complete lunacy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TurnoutPAC This would be a travesty. It's bad enough we let him be president for 8 years, olny complete leftist lunatics looking for more ways to kill unborn babies would want Obama on the supreme court.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LifeNewsHQ This woman must think Satan is Jesus. She is nuts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not something to be proud of. It's a sick and evil world when an entite nation brags about #babymurder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is TRUE Courage and Bravery. Rejecting Abortion is much more difficult than taking the easy/selfish way out, which many women do every single day. Pray for those going through this situation and pray for ALL unborn children and their mothers!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Horrific!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the best Anti-Abortoin videos I have seen, but simply horrific, too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course, she avoids the real question and Infanticide isn't going to be illegal for longer if we continue to let #satanssoldiers like @WarrenPres2020 run this country. She's pure evil wrapped in some convincing words to ensure the easily influenced are brainwashed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#DEMONcrats are cowards that don't care about anything but thier own evil #babymurder agenda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dbongino But of course since the #DEMONcrats have also authored the largest mass murder in history and aim to expand it into #infanticide. They must atrack @POTUS due to his constant getting in the way of their evil depopulation satanic sacrifice of babies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamSchiff He's more credible than the snakes only showing one side of the story while censoring the other to brainwash the masses into thinking their agenda is the only way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WarrenPres2020  is #Hitler in female form. Hitler killed Jews, Warren want #babymurder to be legal and #Infanticide to become normal. A vote for her is a vote for Satan.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ToupsFamily 100% agree. Why do we, as humans, think we get to play God with the lives of the innocent for our own selfish pleasure?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iamdevinnsmart @shelly18764867 Smart move. I cannot understand why anybody would remain in a party responsible for the worst #genocide our world has ever seen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Redirection and denual just like Satan. @PPFA is nothing more than the @ChurchofSatan making #humansacrifice to appease their god for personal gain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LifeNewsHQ Men need to have a say as they are called to be the spiritual leaders of the family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This has always sickened me. Women are not gods and putting the man in this position is mocking the bible. #iStand4Life #MensRights<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LifeNewsHQ She'd sing a different tune if she could profit from killing those children too. Hypocrite in action.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ummm....what do you think abortion is moron? @PPFA is Satans greatest accomplishment and this #soldierofsatan is a brainwashed puppet of #babymurder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LifeNewsHQ He must repent as he's on the fast track to the fires of hell. Christians are called to pray for this man and all our enemies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melodyv916 Sending prayers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmyBrenneman you must not have Christ in your life or you'd have deep regets for killing your innocent child.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@s8nlucifer @realDonaldTrump That fits too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamalaHarris At least you're not pretending to be good when you're an absolute EVIL human being. I will pray for your soul as it's on a direct course to hell. You can still be saved, but you have to STOP voting for #BabyMurder and deciding a woman has the right to kill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Time to #DrainTheSwamp and get rid of these evil #SoldiersOfSatan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Correction, they are #DEMONcrats, not #democrats as they work for #Satan not the American People!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LifeNewsHQ Yet they compare @POTUS @realDonaldTrump to #Hitler when the real Hitler in our world is @PPFA and their evil agenda to carry out the absolute worst #genocide in history while making massive profits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LifeNewsHQ We MUST draw the line at conception and STOP allowing #leftlunatics and #DEMONcrats to push the line further and further out. #Infanticide is horrific, but so is #Abortion. It's ALL #BABYMURDER<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesMartinSJ You'll probably burst into flames when you enter with all the sin and pain you promote while wearing your sheep's clothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Explain to me how anybody who supports the right for a woman to commit #babymurder can also be #provaccinationmandate ?? You want freedom for #WomensRights but you don't want the same #FreedomOfChoice for parents??  #Freedom in the #USA shouldn't be selective!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenGillibrand Abortion isn't healthcare, it's #babymurder and women have no right to play god over an innocent life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenGillibrand It's a massive hoax used to scare people into socialist abd you're just one of the puppets pushing it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenGillibrand No one with a heart should sign this garbage petition or fight against life. Satan is the author of abortion and nothing about abortion is healthcare or normal. Only selfish, brainwashed, evil people believe it's normal to slaughter the innocent babies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This can only come from Satan. #babymurder #shoutyourabortion #silencenomore #AbortionIsMurder #AbortionSurvivors #AbortionIsNotHealthcare<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LifeNewsHQ @christinavazzy Prayer works!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frfrankpavone @spugmommie7 They are the party of Satan and doing everything possible to expand their network of sacrificing the innocent to tgeir evil master for more power and money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HouseDemocrats And vote to kill babies, open our borders to illegal aliens, and all sorts of other evil. Sprinkling in a tiny bit of good doesn't take away from tge true #DEMONcrat label most of this partu has earned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LifeNewsHQ @SBAList Because they love murder, especially when it's the innocent. Its a blood sacrifice to Satan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HillaryClinton @GabbyGiffords @lucymcbath @SpeakerPelosi If they'd arrest you for your many crimes you'd never be able to get approved for a gun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LifeNewsHQ @MeghanMcCain Yes. The #DEMONcrats have made it very clear they only care about illegal immigrants they can use to carry out their evil plans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really @KamalaHarris is the one that should be investigated. Anybody willing to vote to kill babies and infants usn't squeaky clean.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LifeNewsHQ @KamalaHarris Satan's evil soldier at work. Probably being groomed to replace @HilaryClinton_<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #DEMONcrats only care about those they can brainwash to vote for them. @KamalaHarris doesn't care about innocent babies, but illegal immigrants matter to her....#smokeandmirrors<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep revealing hate all across the country. When the left can't debate intelligently they call for violence because they are immoral, murdering, satan worshipers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimRunsHisMouth Horrified and disgusted are just the start. It's downright evil satanic worship and it must be stopped.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @spugmommie7 Its another step in the direction of #Hitler for #DEMONcrats. They want to pick and choose who lives, who dies, who eats, who works, who has value, and how all these things are done.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump They should also break the black rock around their tiny hearts and find the necessary love it take to realize how wrong #infanticide and #abortion are. Of coursr all this would require #DEMONcrats to halt thier satan worship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_LoveLike_JESUS Amen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LifeNewsHQ They only support healthcare for all so that more people will be prescribed drugs they don't need and brainwashing the masses will become easier as they continue their plot to depopulate the earth.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Tristan_Lewis08 @AOC I won't go that far as no one should be aborted, but shecertainly doesn't belong in a leadership position. She's a puppet of the far left power hungry greedy aholes trying to destroy the USA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NRCC Yes immediately<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@5u6l1m8 @YouTube You are referring to a scenario that doesn't even make sense. It's a lazy argument since it's impossible to actually get consent from someone that doesn't exist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@5u6l1m8 @YouTube Thats false<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LifeNewsHQ So democrats and planned parenthood are stupid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LifeNewsHQ @BernieSanders @KamalaHarris @ewarren @SenGillibrand @amyklobuchar Every one of then is playing with a deck of cards given to them by satan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eatyourenglish @5u6l1m8 Yes very true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@5u6l1m8 @YouTube As humans we have the choice between heaven and hell. Not having children just so they don't end up in hell is a terrible rationalization and rooted in a lack of faith.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@5u6l1m8 @YouTube I see this conversation as a very negative view, not rooted in faith versus a view rooted in faith. I'm guessing you're not Christian or you'd see the difference much easier.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@t_hicksnelson Amen<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hrenee80 @unsilentwitness Evil is the reason and selfish soldiers of satan vote for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@5u6l1m8 @YouTube Yes we have free will and we play our role in the process, but it's ultmately up to God to create a life. Our job is to step out of the way and not prevent the possibility.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@5u6l1m8 @YouTube I think it has to start with realizing how much value God puts on every life and having a baby isn't supposed to be a human choice. We are not God, but when we decide it's up to us and only us when it comes to creating life, we are playing God.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@5u6l1m8 @YouTube All commandments lead to an obligation for a Christian.   Putting anything in the way of the creation of life is found multiple times in the bible and refers to any form of birth control.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ViraBurnayeva @unsilentwitness Shocker lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LifeNewsHQ She can defend her sin all the way to hell unless she wakes up and asks for forgiveness.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LifeNewsHQ Most definitely. They are all evil and care about nothing but power and $$$<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A #DEMONcrat ready to brainwash anybody willing to listen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@5u6l1m8 @YouTube In addition, if you are Christian, your faith is in God to provide and lead, so procreating, when given the opportunity, allows you to trust God with your life and the new life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@5u6l1m8 @YouTube #1, an unborn baby exists. #2 God commanded us to pro-create. #3 We are also commanded not to put things in the way of God creating life. #4 if someone doesn't exist you may save them from hell, but you also rob them of any chance of heaven...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@5u6l1m8 @YouTube A deeper understanding of the value life has to God is necessary. Every life matters because God desire we choose Him, hence free will. Abortion without repentance sends the mother to hell and gives the baby no free will to choose God.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@o2avt @YouTube First of all, it's not a fetus, it's a baby! Second of all, there are several instances where men are not even given the chance to take care of their baby. Finally, blaming men is just rationalizing the horrific murder of a baby.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChurchCandace @VeritasRadioNet He is clearly working for Satan as a wolf dressed in sheeps clothing. We were warned about this and he's not the only wolf trying to take down the Catholic Church. @zacharyaking said when he was a satanist they went after the Catholic and Baptist churches.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChurchCandace @VeritasRadioNet Choice is just a word used to rationalize an evil sacrifice to Satan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@obianuju @ChurchCandace This is absolutely horrific!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BurkeCNN @ChurchCandace Catholics need to realize the church isn't the priests, bishops, and pope, but the people. The church has faced many issues throughout the 2000 years of existence and has always survived. Stand Strong Catholics!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CatholicismGuy @ChurchCandace Very, Very, Very sad, but so very true. My grandparents had 15, my parents 4, my wife and I none, yet, but hoping for a bunch (whatever God will bless us with).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How true. Every Abortion is a sacrifice to Satan. Once we realize Satan cannot create anything and only aims to destroy and mock, we will realize our goal should be to Love Christ so much it makes Satan cry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tfpsa @ChurchCandace If we really want these horrific, satanic rituals to stop, we need to stop attending them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidGMichael74 @ChurchCandace There are plenty of wolves dressed as sheep in the Catholic Church and all other Christian churches. Satan is alive and well and has demons whispering in many ears these days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheKingDude @ChurchCandace The NFL is one of the most corrupt sports leagues in the world. I stopped watching years ago and never returned.

<|startoftext|>@ChurchCandace @VeritasRadioNet @TheKingDude Even if they don't come to the defense, they should at least be realizing these are teenagers in need of guidance. Even if someone thinks what they did is wrong, they should still be offering the ability to gain forgiveness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChurchCandace @nadia_kahla @VeritasRadioNet This shouldn't be tolerated no matter what. Even the worst serial killer has a chance to be forgiven and redeemed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChurchCandace @TheKingDude What finally caused the ban?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meNeedsome I don't think you really exposed anything here and judging by your profile picture, I think we all know who you work for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yeahcatholic You can't. You can only love them and hope they find it with your guidance. Trying to convince someone almost always backfires. Lead by example through actions matching words and with joy in your heart. That's more convincing than anything else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ToupsFamily Can I add, and to raise our childrne to know the truth, live the truth, defend the truth, share the truth and suffer the truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BasementCatERE @PiattPatti @AynRandPaulRyan Let me just say, I went through Catholic school until 10th grade and while it wasn't deplorable, it wasn't exactly what it should be. We don't raise our children to understand what it truly means to be Catholic and often, parents trust the school to do the heavy lifting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@admit2sin First, the excuse is some tradition of black out games, which is poor, at best. Second, as a Catholic, I don't think this is how we should be raising our youth. I have a problem with how crazy some schools get about sports, and then they can't even get the kids to sing at Mass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nbrink77 @MollieOReilly @DanHoranOFM Remember, they are teenagers and humans. Nobody's actions reflect their heart 100% of the time. If they did, we wouldn't need a Savior.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IAmTonyWarrick Awesome! When God takes you from this earth, you're done being needed here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesMartinSJ @DanHoranOFM Trolls come out to play no matter who you are, how nice or upstanding you are, or what you stand for. The way you know you stand for something on Social Media is when the Trolls show up. If you don't get threatened regularly, you're probably not standing up enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sammieheals @mmpadellan What's sad to me is that we take one action of someone and label them forever based on that one action. Then, we threaten them over it and never stop to realize they are TEENAGERS and there are usually about 5 sides to these stories and NONE of them are 100% true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Augustus709 @browneyebabe25 So when it's President Trump, anything and everything that goes wrong automatically leads back to him, but I never heard anybody saying this with Obama, Bush, Clinton, Bush or any other president. Stop blaming the president for the actions of others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaultRadio Everybody lawyers up in this county whenever anything happens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@micaiah157 Those numbers actually seem low, but it's still rather sick. That's a lot of murder on the hands of those involved and a lot of sacrifices to Satan. No wonder evil tends to rule this world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thecjpearson If this is true, it's pathetic and horrific. If we judges our students based on the actions of others in their schools ALL the time, nobody would be admitted to college or university.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@panerabread Neither....Tomato all the way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChasingOzPhotog Abortion is MURDER, not a medical procedure. NO other "medical procedure" kills!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump It's not and they campaigned on a bunch of lies used to kill more innocent babies and try to take over the entire country. It's all a part of an attempt to build a one world goverment, which is what the Clintons want and Obamas want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeepStateExpose While I am not familiar with the source, so I won't just jump to believe this, if it is true, the Catholic church, which I belong do, it being led by a poser, not a true pope. For me, as a Catholic, I cling to realizing the church isn't the humans leading it and they are flawed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesMartinSJ It's not our place to pass judgement. That's up to God and those in authority over the people involved. All we do when we pass unwarranted judgement on others is make assumptions without ever truly knowing what's going on. We are mere spectators trying to piece it together.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshleyJRMC @JamesMartinSJ Let's remember, if you're Catholic and you make one mistake, it gets put in the news somewhere. No other religion deals with this type or scrutiny.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MollieOReilly @DanHoranOFM We are also not the ones that should be passing judgment as we don't know the hearts of these teenagers, their parents or those around them.

<|startoftext|>@NBCOlympics @guskenworthy Yea, now I think those wanting to be famous in the LGBTQ community just sell their souls. The guy admitted to using witchcraft to get where he is....not shining a positive light on the LGBTQ community if you ask me.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TeamUSA @Adaripp Working for satan and admitted to it when he said, "I can't explain witchcraft" not confidence, instead evil.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SenBobCasey @Adaripp Proud isn't the right word when he opening admits to using witchcraft to become who he is. Nothing about this person should be inspirational to anybody unless you're goal is to be evil in this world.<|endoftext|>
