<|startoftext|>.@BorisJohnson is not interested in Saving Lives, as he was clearly told to BUT IGNORED in Sept AND Oct by Scientists &amp; Leader of opposition.  Now he only wants to 'Save Christmas' - Turkey's before Lives. Let that sink in.  #SundayThoughts  #NationalLockdown<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Can't be alone in thinking  .@BorisJohnson &amp;  .@michaelgove are lying &amp; misleading again.  They did in Sept, then Oct and doing same again now. They know and have all the evidence now as then, but are lying to us.  Again.  #SecondLockdown #NationalLockdown<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 Madness you say🧐 Let me see, who should we believe.  JHB, foghorn xenophobic radio host with no scientific background, says we shouldn't lockdown.

<|startoftext|>@GDreamZX @SkySportsBoxing @TonyBellew Exactly, he could easily have taken him out. I actually think OU wanted to go 12, to see how much he could take.

<|startoftext|>@Jeremy_Hunt Brave??? More like STUPID to ignore what everyone was telling him 2 months ago!!  And only a couple of weeks ago he called the LOTO crazy for calling for this. Now he's brave??  You're all muppets<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#SecondLockdown #NationalLockdown  No doubt now,  .@BorisJohnson is simply not up to job. Needs to resign. Told in Sept by Govt scientists to do so - ignored it. Was then told to do right thing by sKS, but pride got in way. You can't keep messing with people's lives like this!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SecondLockdown  #Lockdown2  Why is the information leaking ahead of Johnson's press conference, from the usual suspects??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Normal pattern for Govt info. Leaked to Favourable newspapers to pre-warn public, followed by a press conference, THEN told to HoC   #Lockdown2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sure I heard Leader of Opp few weeks ago suggest we go into short, sharp lockdown for around about now, *based on scientific advice*, yet PM &amp; Co scoffed, saying he was an opportunist &amp; playing politics.

<|startoftext|>@mellow_elephant @KyleW_89 @AaronBastani I got no beef with you or anyone else, just heartless Tory bar stewards. I don't see point of going around n round in circles 🙏🏽 Right now, the common enemy is ones causing the misery - BJ govt. Aim your fire at them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mellow_elephant @KyleW_89 @AaronBastani If anyone's enabled Tories, it's JC himself. Using YOUR theory, If he thought centrists were working against him (&amp; internal polls showed he couldn't win) Why take BJ bait for GE? Opposition had Maj. All had to do was wait &amp; let BJ drown himself. But JC ego got better of him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mellow_elephant @KyleW_89 @AaronBastani I recall it was at Lab Conference, You're blaming him for something lab members *voted on* and *wanted*🤷🏻‍♂️ and added to manifesto. If was only sKS &amp; co, Lab members could have voted it down, no? And what's that say about JC leadership, that he didn't understand party's mood?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mellow_elephant @KyleW_89 @AaronBastani FTR, I was with JC until summer of '16. Even then, still backed him big at 17 &amp; 19 GE. Why? Bc wanted heartless Tories out.  Didn't 100% agree but could see was better than blue Shysters, &amp; once in, you talk &amp; make change. That's should be ALL Labour approach now under sKS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mellow_elephant @KyleW_89 @AaronBastani So had nothing to do with majority of UK public who simply didn't want hard left Govt, rather was centrists?🤦🏻‍♂️😂 just sounds like excuses &amp; conspiracies. Know hard to accept when you've lost &amp; natural to blame something/someone, but reality is, COUNTRY didn't want him. TWICE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RussInCheshire Never mind that, what's she trying to prove? That she's hard or something??😂  https://t.co/vi3BXSsEvS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*Not Looking For A Pile On*  Genuinely, can anyone tell me what #JeremyCorbyn has actually achieved as MP of 37yrs?🤔 Not as leader, as MP. Bear in mind #Labour were in power for 13yrs during thise years as well. Curious  #LabourAntisemitism  #LabourParty  #FridayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanDunt Wow, that tells you everything about both men. sKS had the decency to speak to him and let him know in advance, and all JC did was defend his leadership, even though report said they'd done wrong, and stab sKS in the back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KyleW_89 @mellow_elephant @AaronBastani And then as much as the blues are ***** and enacting the policies, it'll also be bc of people who are so entrenched that they're not willing to unite, even if they have differences, to face down these inequalities &amp; injustices of the CONs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KyleW_89 @mellow_elephant @AaronBastani Your prerogative🙄 But you'd rather cut off your nose to spite your face?🤔Telling us if choice btw vote Tory, get corrupt, heartless bstrds who don't feed kids, OR vote Lab, albeit not perfect but will sort most issues, you'd vote neither??🤦🏻‍♂️ Kids will continue to go hungry<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Dix_i312 @mellow_elephant @AaronBastani Respectfully disagree.  We are here bc JC should never have took BJ's GE bait last Oct/Nov. He couldn't win. No GE = No Tory 80 maj🤷🏻‍♂️ Also, sKS was knight before became MP. TB's massive **** for Iraq but can't hide won 3 GEs big. Importantly, did with likes JC &amp; left in party 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If true as you say 👏🏽👏🏽 Our Govt has zero compassion   #ToryScumOut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mellow_elephant @AaronBastani Now, now, no need for that😉 Last I looked, JC had 2 goes &amp; lost twice, yet all hear from JC fans is excuses &amp; blaming everyone else. Bottom line, reason BJ's wreaking havoc is bc of JC, who didn't need to accept GE challenge.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DancerDad @Patrick30430147 @observeronly4 @mi6rogue @MetCC So the natural reaction to being asked to put a mask on is...smack someone in the eye?🧐 He may have a valid reason for not wearing it, but there's telling someone, and then there's 'telling' someone. Obvs he feels empowered to do it in the latter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ADDoyle710 @Possum_PictBot @MichelleMone Totally. Not even a shred of doubt. Technically it's actually our money which these people are getting, which an unelected bureaucrat like Goebbels-Cummings &amp; Co are dishing out<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jonlis1 The question I keep asking Jonathan is why are we not looking at Germany? What are they doing that we aren't? Larger population &amp; country, yet seem to much better 'control'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@campbellclaret I agree we should Honour those who have attained special achievements, done something outside of their area, or gone above &amp; beyond *without pay*. Not honour someone who's just doing their job. Plus we should update honour's title. Officer, commander, member? What empire??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AStepToTheLeft @dannycmorrissey @gw_emily @ArgyleLoz 80 seat maj? We can thank JC for that. Goaded into GE he could never win by BJ, fell into the trap. Shockingly poor judgement. All he had to do was sit &amp; wait, let Bozo Implode with no maj. Now, whatever he does to country has been enabled by jez, however much you want to deny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArgyleLoz Don't leave Loz!!  We can never all agree on everything, that much is clear, but we all have to fight on common ground. And that's GTTO. Don't let hate win. Stay strong, stick with it 💪🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikelido @AStepToTheLeft @gw_emily @ArgyleLoz Thank God for that 😅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AStepToTheLeft @mikelido @gw_emily @ArgyleLoz Whatever??😂 FTR actually think he had chance of being PM now but for naivety last Oct. Opp had majority, BJ was struggling over Brexit &amp; was begging him for GE as polling showed Tory win. Lab polling showed Lab defeat but JC went ahead.  No GE = No Tory win🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AStepToTheLeft @mikelido @gw_emily @ArgyleLoz JC is just like many others in Lab &amp; Tory party - career politician.  37yrs in HoC, nice annual salary, lovely million pound pension pot accumulated. Am I wrong? Plus, what has he actually achieved as an MP, even when Lab were in power? Seem to vote against party frequently<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AStepToTheLeft @mikelido @gw_emily @ArgyleLoz Corbyn train has left the  station &amp; not coming back😂  Sabotage you say?🤔 May I remind you JC went on holiday mid Referendum campaign, hindering Remain. Or hours after result, went on TV to call for art50 to be triggered immediately, with no plan whatsoever in place for UK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikelido @AStepToTheLeft @gw_emily @ArgyleLoz Keep living in dream land guys. That's only place you can win. In the real world, you had your go. And lost. Get over it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AStepToTheLeft @gw_emily @ArgyleLoz You just sound like sore losers🙄 Not a hater, JC had 4yrs to do something in 2 GE, Euros &amp; locals, as well as Ref. He lost in *All* and/or lost seats. Fact. If that's case with sKS, I'd say same. Right now, he's Lab's best hope to beat Bozo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I know this is few mths old, but would love for .@andrealeadsom to point out /show us where it says it was made 'perfectly clear' in the campaign that people would lose their jobs in the event of #nodealbrexit during the Referendum.  #Brexit #PMQs #BrexitShambles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElstonGunn87 @AStepToTheLeft @gw_emily @ArgyleLoz Campaign??🤦🏻‍♂️😂 Have you learnt nothing in last 5yrs? JC didn't win. Twice. Bc *country* didn't approve. I'm not hating, just stating.  Best bet now is to get behind Lab leader who at least *looks* like he can challenge &amp; Win Muppet Johnson, then make  difference from within.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElstonGunn87 @AStepToTheLeft @gw_emily @ArgyleLoz Let me break it down. Tories win, you can do Nothing. Zilch. Zero. Whereas Labour win, you have a CHANCE of making a difference &amp; doing something *from within*. Not rocket science.  Point is, get into power 1st,  to start to make change. No power = No opportunity.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AStepToTheLeft @gw_emily @ArgyleLoz Done playing games? Doesn't look like it🙄 2 attempts, JC couldn't win. Corbyn lost bc it's not what MAJORITY in UK want. What's difficult to understand about that? By not backing sKS, all you do is bring more misery on yourself, family &amp; friends, as Tories will win.  Again.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HelenSalmon2 Respect 😉 Here's what I've never understood about them. If they're constantly that pissed off with Labour, even after running it for 4yrs, why don't they go and form their own party, and do what they like? No one's stopping them🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Anybody wanting Trump to die from #COVID19 are stupid. Just casue he's a nob, don't be one too.

<|startoftext|>@andreajenkyns @POTUS To all the fascist right like Andrea, let's hope he recovers, loses, is indicted and punished for his crimes with no immunity, such as sexual allegations by 26 woman, tax fraud and being a Russian asset. It'll be so funny to watch.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Always worth a revisit 😂Johnson didn't need to make a statement. They could have just played this instead.   #lockdown #TuesdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One major fact from Sir .@Keir_Starmer speech. The Tories have won 5 GE in last 10yrs, more than Labour has in last 75yrs!  Lab supporters - left, right to centre - need to get their head round this. Carry on as you are &amp; that will become 6.  #labour2020 #TuesdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#lockdown #COVID19  So Johnson says you can only have 15 people attend one of the happiest days of your life (wedding), but you can have double that attend probably the saddest (funeral) 😶 #TuesdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#lockdown #PMQs  Johnson lies. It's not NHS test &amp; trace Johnson, it's SERCO test &amp; trace!!🤬 Serco is a private company, owned and run by Tory donors. Lying in parliament.  Again. Why's it's important? Serco are looking at profit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Podgereeno @SkySportsPL At a guess - Salary. Jota will be this side of 100k, which will prob be double what he was on at Wolves. Heard Werner is on 200k plus, which would put him above highest earner Mo. Not just about transfer fee, it's the whole package. Jota more economical sense for a bench warmer<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Funny how that works 🧐🤦🏻‍♂️😂 #Moonshot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When someone who voted for #Brexit starts criticising their leader Johnson for going ahead with breaking the law that may help them deliver what they want, you know you've got a problem.  #FridayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great thread 👏🏽👍🏽 #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DominicRaab @LinkeviciusL @OSCE You're joking, right??🤨🤦🏻‍♂️ You guys did same with law breaking in Referendum!  Plus, the minute your mate stood in parl &amp; said you're Breaking the Law on an Int treaty, you lost any right to say anything to anyone on following the rules.  #BrexitShambles #ToryLawBreakers<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>With this statement, Braverman has torpedoed any future opportunity for this Tory leader &amp; Govt to say anything to any other country regarding international law, treaties &amp; internal conflicts. They'd just show us this &amp; say '**** off'  #Brexit #BrexitShambles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someone should send this to @BorisJohnson, i think it's quite important   #BrexitShambles #ToryLawBreakers #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KateWilton1 @Keir_Starmer @EdwardJDavey That's what I first thought, then I realised that's exactly what the Tories want - a diversion. 'see he's trying to thwart Brexit'  He's doing the right thing. the EU are stating the case and there'll be plenty of time to put the boot in when it's debated.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hannanator2 He did right. Plenty of time later for this when the bill is published<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#pmqs  On further reflection, Starmer did the right thing by dodging the Law breaking topic. There will be plenty of time &amp; many questions from other MPs for that. Funny though as it basically kaiboshed all Johnson's preprepared answers 😂  #BrexitShambles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeborahTheaker Johnson would just bluff &amp; bluster it anyway<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>.@MattHancock saying he is ok with his Govt 'Breaking the Law' on something THEY Agreed, Signed &amp; Voted for, it's fair to assume he has ZERO CREDIBILITY when it comes to anything to do with #COVID19 &amp; asking people to stop meeting etc.  #WednesdayThoughts #BrexitShambles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidallengreen True, if it's the sincere. But I don't think it is.  This is all deliberate, set out to make waves &amp; rock the boat They know they are screwed in coming months bc the EU hasn't blinked. They're counting on this to make that happen.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DPJHodges What, You're actually trying to justify Govt breaking a treaty, by minimising it's importance?🤨 Tell you what, next time you get parking ticket for 2mins late or speeding ticket for 12% over limit, try using same minimising logic.  See what happens. #BrexitShambles  https://t.co/I1Kf9IoaqA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DehennaDavison 😂🤣 Ok, so If you're not Stupid, then logically, you must be Incompetent? You voted for WA blindly without fully reading or understanding it.

<|startoftext|>@KSchafheutle Exactly (more or less) what I was typing. He should step aside. But this is #BorisJohnson we're talking about. He has zero Integrity &amp; is totally shameless.

<|startoftext|>@Youngie60 @uk_domain_names @johnredwood I like that 👍🏽😂 May use in future 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tories voted AGAINST putting into law rules that could save people living in tower blocks from burning to death. Think about that. Who does such a thing?  Same people who sent 25,000 of our elderly loved ones to their deaths during #COVID19 outbreak  #GrenfellTower #Grenfell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@BorisJohnson Lied to British public in Dec 2019 GE. He won 80 seat majority on back of getting us out of EU with WA &amp; Oven Ready deal HE is now saying is no good. Reminder - WA HE negotiated! He can't continue on back of this. He cannot be trusted   #TuesdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KateWilton1 Complacency &amp; ignorance. Most are too consumed with their own matters to think about bigger picture. Here's a grant, here's furlough salary, here's a govt backed loan, here's a 50% off discount etc.  Will only come when hurts them personally. Remember toilet rolls/Pasta fiasco😉<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Sir Keir .@Keir_Starmer - now is the time! You &amp; Lab PR/Media team need to get down &amp; dirty. No More Mr Nice Guy &amp; pragmatic silence. Johnson has given you everything you need - Go Public &amp; tear him apart!!  #mondaythoughts #BrexitShambles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UHDDreamer That's right. They know there is no short and say answer to the Brexit Rubik's cube, but that's what the patrons &amp; donors want.  When it happens, it's going to be long and painful for average man/woman, they will get blamed &amp; that's why they're planting the seeds for a scapegoat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂🤣👏🏽 #Brexit #BrexitShambles #BrexitLies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UHDDreamer They'd probably say Yes, then just like Johnson has done throughout his life, do the exact opposite after, thinking he's clever and people will forget<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imagine being an EU negotiator this week, going into meetings with UK to try and agree a trade agreement, knowing that last one #BorisJohnson signed less than 12 months ago, is about to bypassed. Why'd you trust anything these Shysters say or do?  #BrexitShambles #BrexitReality<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BrexitShambles   Imagine a PM that thinks adding 40% tariff to some of our products is a 'good outcome'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>May didn't know what Brexit was, and now it seems, neither does Johnson 🤷🏻‍♂️🙄🤦🏻‍♂️  #BrexitShambles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trussliz Why are you wasting time &amp; tax payers money? 🤔 #NoDealBrexit trading on WTO is a good outcome apparently, we don't need trade deals in place.   Well at least that's what your soon to be ex boss says...  #pointless #BrexitShambles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To .@BorisJohnson the #WithdrawalAgreement is like his marriages. Not worth the paper it's written on.  #mondaythoughts #BrexitShambles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acmtix All Corbyn had to do was work with opposition in the meantime. He didn't want to do that either.  So yes, it may seem simplistic but it's not really wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acmtix Don't get me wrong,  damage will be done by Johnson &amp; Co, but JC (&amp; Swinson too) had no chance of winning yet ploughed on anyway. Imagine if hadn't. Opposition would have had 40 Maj, Brexit would have been done in a sensible &amp; smoother manner. Now? Tories can do what they like<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acmtix Not really. It's basically what happened. Lab had no chance of winning, it was a pipe dream. Internal polling showed it (something came out earlier this year showing that) yet he fell for Johnson's honey trap.  We are where we are as a result.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#mondaythoughts  Never forget. Whatever's going to happen now re: #NoDealBrexit is directly attributed to #JeremyCorbyn. No giving in to Johnson's goading = No GE = No Tory majority = No NDB. Johnson may be carrying out the deeds, but Corbyn was their Trojan   #BrexitShambles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What was the point of all those votes in parliament last year to stop a no deal, if a year later, we are heading straight for that?  #mondaythoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tories trapped in their own web of lies. AGAIN.🤦🏻‍♂️ Apparently #NoDealBrexit is so good, we can trade freely on WTO rules with anyone, incl EU.  No need for Trade deals. Great. So begs question, what's point of .@trussliz, Abbott &amp; Board of Trade?🤔 #BrexitShambles #mondaythoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can Tory Govt  .@10DowningStreet pls explain very simple thing to population of UK. If #NoDealBrexit is a 'Good outcome' as PM .@BorisJohnson says, then WTH have they wasted FOUR YRS negotiating FOR a deal??🤔  #BrexitShambles #mondaythoughts<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ruralmaestro @emeicen Regardless that he was remain, he's lifelong anti-EU. He 'talked the talk' in Ref but his heart wasn't really in it. That's why, less than 12hrs after result, was first to say we should invoke A50, without any sort of plan in place. Who does that? Someone who's happy with result<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ruralmaestro @emeicen Really? Didn't he go on a 2wk break in middle of Ref campaign, around Easter. Who does that?

<|startoftext|>Obvious question of the day.  Politics aside, has anyone stopped to ask why UK has the highest #COVID19 Death toll in Europe, 2nd highest infections in Europe (excl Russia) and amongst worst affected overall in world?  Reactive rather than proactive🤔  #SundayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nicktolhurst 👍🏽 In few years they'll be telling their readers the EU were the ones who *forced* the Referendum on us<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What?🧐 1 min Brexidiots / RW media like 'No Deal Brexit suits us fine, WTO here we go!' Now it's 'EU are not being nice &amp; forcing us into No Deal Brexit!!' It's almost like they knew *ALL ALONG* that NDB will cripple us &amp; now shittin it as know what's coming🧐 #SaturdayThoughts<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>A reminder of the true nature of Johnson. A complete a-hole. #SaturdayThoughts<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Great theory, probably right. #FridayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤔🤔🤔 Could it be ol Fartface Farage is copying what Bannon did with collecting money for Brexit party, just like Bannon did in America for the build a wall thing, then using it for personal use? If so, Farage is in the shit. Someone should take a look #ThursdayThoughts<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You'd think with all noise of 14 day quarantine &amp;  Johnson pushing us to stay in UK for summer hols - Staycation - there'd be pics of him, with 'girlfriend' &amp; their 'baby' all over press &amp; TV whilst holidaying in Scotland?🤔 Nope. Not even one🤨 Why is that?🤔 #ThursdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iangardner13 So sorry to hear that. May God be with you at this most difficult time 🤲🏽🙏🏽<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If you're one of Labour voters in so called 'red wall' who voted for Tories at GE, Whatever has happened &amp; is happening, is partly down to you. And if you lose your job in the process bc of Tory action or inaction, you've only got yourself to blame. #WednesdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage Crocodile tears🙄🤬 You're probably gloating. Another off your list.  Man = 18.  16 = child.  This was a child who lost his life trying to get to safety &amp; better way of life.  You are lower than scum at a sewage plant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@southpawvista 'Johnson cheated on her' . No shocks there then, if true.  I don't believe they were ever 'an item', it was all planned &amp; for show, especially for GE. He has proven numerous times throughout his life where his loyalty lies. With himself. A leopard never changes its spots<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is so, so sad 😔  Bet Racist-Patel, Xenophibe-Farage &amp; Co  will be smirking  #WednesdayThoughts #Refugees   https://t.co/vg1F2BPX9v<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dido Harding as boss of new health body?  Last 3 roles. CEO at TalkTalk when lost Cust data, fined &amp; resigned. Dir at Cheltenham in March where 100s got #COVID19.

<|startoftext|>@acmtix @JJHTweets @cirian75 @BrexitBin @BettGunther @ThatTimWalker @adamboultonSKY 👍🏽 Corbyn was student union protest firey, and Starmer is Bar club firey.  Need to get Lammy &amp; Philips out front, cause a little ruckus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BettGunther @JohnFoster12 @JJHTweets @cirian75 @BrexitBin @ThatTimWalker @adamboultonSKY You're right but average Joe and Josephine don't / can't see it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnFoster12 @JJHTweets @cirian75 @BrexitBin @BettGunther @ThatTimWalker @adamboultonSKY Funnily enough, I thought same😉   https://t.co/ZOlcqO1XiX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acmtix @JJHTweets @cirian75 @BrexitBin @BettGunther @ThatTimWalker @adamboultonSKY 😂 He can ask but don't think would make any diff. BJ has 80 seat maj &amp; gives no fcuks about anything other than public perception. When Telegraph &amp; Mail turn on him, he U-turns. Only thing that really works is if public rise up, like last 4 days. sKS should be at front of that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pathetic diversionary tactic.  The unacceptable stupidity, corruption &amp; incompetence of your party must stop now. Examples:  A level results,  PPE contracts,  Covid19 response, Cummings 60 mile eyesight test drive. #ToryShambles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can Johnson sack Williamson? After all, he's keeper of their secrets. Was chief whip 2016-17  when there was lots of noise re: list of Tory MPs up to sexual shenanigans, prob incls some of current cabinet, *which he kept hidden*  Imagine dirt he has   #TuesdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoelBaccas Don't think it was because of French or German's😂 but no I won't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acmtix @JJHTweets @cirian75 @BrexitBin @BettGunther @ThatTimWalker @adamboultonSKY He could but it's be pointless. They have no shame. Only way it can happen is for him to be the scapegoat &amp; be sacked by Bozo.  sKS has been calling Johnson &amp; Tories incompetent non-stop since yesterday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AlevelResults #UTurn  Johnson/Williamson Fri - System is robust, dependable, No U-turn, No change.   3 days later - apologies. We looked at our future election chances with all these 18yr olds &amp; thought 'oh fcuk' &amp; so we're doing a massive u-turn so not to piss em off anymore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surely this has to be another record for .@BorisJohnson. Most U-turns for a PM within a year? 🤔  #TuesdayThoughts #AlevelResults #UTurn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Johnson's cult, I mean Govt, are world beating alright.  World beating in the 'let's be the shittest' competition  #AlevelResults #UTurn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPJHodges So he'd rather take a pasting than do the honourable thing. Oh wait, he (they) don't know what that word means nor have it in their vocabulary  Pathetic shameless heartless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know when watch TV &amp; see something but doesn't affect you, you shrug - that's most been like last few months with #COVID19 Johnson etc But when DIRECTLY affects your kids, THAT'S when you feel it. That's the #ALevelsResults fiasco. Don't forget who did this #ToryShambles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beautiful &amp; well done Anna 👍🏽👏🏽🙂 #tuesdayvibes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is Gavin Williamson going for a new record? Sacked TWICE by two consecutive PM's 😂🤦🏻‍♂️ Surely got to be a first, if/when it happens?  Anyone care to corroborate  #ALevelsResults #UTurn  #TuesdayThoughts   @JJHTweets @cirian75 @BrexitBin @BettGunther @ThatTimWalker @adamboultonSKY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AjMillsey1 SHYSTERS  a person/people who uses unscrupulous, fraudulent, or deceptive methods in their dealings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely roasted by  .@skynewsniall 🔥👏🏽😂 Williamson is a mattress shop deputy manager saying sorry. He knew the goods were faulty before he sold them.  #UTurn #ALevelsResults<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just because they've done a U-turn and maybe got some of the children back on track, don't forget how much heartache they put you through. Remember this at the next GE  #ALevelProtests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What an absolute Shyster!!🤬 You telling me he didn't know about the results before the weekend!?!🤦🏻‍♂️🤬 At the minimum,  .@GavinWilliamson must resign for not having the basic sense of what was going on. And if he doesn't, Johnson must SACK HIM  #ALevelProtests #EnoughIsEnough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going with previous 2 answers #ToryShambles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DJackdaw @mattremains Sounds about right. One too many scandals for my liking. Totally incompetent Govt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am so grateful &amp; thankful my children are all past this stage and been/at uni, last one was last year. Can't even begin to imagine the chaos students &amp; parents must be going through right now🙏🏽🤲🏽 Stay strong &amp; hang in there people 💪🏽 #ALevelProtests #EnoughIsEnough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayJay08752584 Funnily enough, another story broke shortly after this re an MP under arrest🤔 Ever since he's been AWOL  Coincidence?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't get it🤨 You can't one day say this system is robust, dependable &amp; fair, only to do a MASSIVE U-TURN the next day, which implies it was FLIMSY, UNDEPENDABLE &amp; UNFAIR. Someone has made a balls up.   Heads must roll  #ALevelProtests #EnoughIsEnough #mondaythoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If this is what happens with  .@BorisJohnson and Floods, covid19, PPE, cummingsgate and now #ALevelsResults   IMAGINE WTF he's doing with Brexit Trade negotiations?? 😱😱😱😱  #mondaythoughts #ToryShambles #EnoughIsEnough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#EnoughIsEnough   One too many cock-ups methinks  Time for Johnson's bunch of Clowns to leave  #ALevelProtests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🙄🤦🏻‍♂️😂 Complete &amp; Utter F-up!!🤦🏻‍♂️ Should have happened in first place! Last week Johnson called the system 'robust' &amp; 'dependable'. Looks a RIGHT TWAT now - AGAIN😂 - as does Gove/Williamson🤣  #UTurnJohnson #ALevelProtests #ALevelsResults #mondaythoughts   https://t.co/PDMiTYZG8r<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sarf_London  https://t.co/6elvgv8P1k<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davemacladd More like he'd resign then be reselected when there's a reshuffle.  Johnson's need brains like these in his renegades. Makes him look intelligent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If anyone needs firing it's Gove &amp; Cummings  #ALevelProtests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4pm Tory announcement on A-levels  Place your bets  #mondaythoughts #EnoughIsEnough #ALevelProtests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Step up the action Sir K and turn up the heat even more #ALevelProtests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People defending PM Johnson from disappearing (again) at time of crisis is peak🙄 There seems to be pattern to it. Almost like when he can't handle pressure, he runs away and hides🤨 2-3 times already this year.  #mondaythoughts #ALevelProtests #ToryBarStewards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acmtix @Keir_Starmer As much as JC was passionate for causes, he didn't actually achieve very much in HoC. I hold him 'one of' responsibles for where we are now. If didn't give in to BJ goading for GE last Oct, No GE, no 80 seat maj, BJ would be squirming &amp; JC may even have had chance of being PM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quellé surprisé 🤦🏻‍♂️ Johnson has confidence in Williamson 🙄 He has to be the dumbest PM ever of he thinks GW is doing a a good job #ALevelProtests   https://t.co/r1LnBmSSvx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carolecadwalla Cummings with the remote control<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acmtix @Keir_Starmer Give him time &amp; space to work💪🏽👍🏽 Shame JC didn't work out. With respect though, don't forget he's career politician, sKS only came in 2015. JC was councillor, then 36yrs in HoC, nice salary for long time, never had it hard &amp; £1.5m pension pot to retire on. He played the game 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acmtix @Keir_Starmer I know what you mean. barrister by trade, he's got a cool, methodical approach which is needed when questioning Bozo &amp; co. However can come across flat as it's 'too cold' sometimes. I think he'll grow into the role. Only been 4-5mths, he'll get the feedback 😉 @Keir_Starmer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acmtix @Keir_Starmer That's why I say, get together, win, get in a position of ACTUAL power, then can make social changes. Right now it's just all hot air.  Keep eye on the prize.  Do whatever, Win the GE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acmtix @Keir_Starmer I'd disagree on ratings, in most polls sKS is above BJ, where JC never was. Party gaining too. Tory lite? See what you're saying but I'd take '97-10 way anyday to what Tories doing. People/Country was much better off than it is now. No food banks for start. Best times of my life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#wheresBoris 🤔 Probably hiding in a fridge somewhere  #mondaythoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acmtix @Keir_Starmer Politely disagree😉 Reality is without centre Lab can't win.  Last 10yrs, Lab went left under Ed, then more left under JC. Result? 3 GE defeats &amp; other elections too. All Tories have done wrong, Lab STILL couldn't win. Need to learn from that. Get in power 1st THEN make change<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel for ministers* who're gonna be trotted out to defend Govt policy on A-level results, only to be made to look COMPLETE TWATS when Govt eventually u-turn &amp; backtrack. Although they won't feel it as have zero self awareness🤷🏻‍♂️  #mondaythoughts #ALevelResults  *Not really😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone else get feeling the 'left' left are working with right wing Tories?🧐 It's just every time they come out bashing  .@Keir_Starmer &amp; co, all they're doing is making Labour look chaotic. Almost like it's on cue &amp; deliberate. And Who does that benefit🤔  #mondaythoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcelloRuffini So they don't have to give them any...  https://t.co/zBqZZoIbmv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@13sarahmurphy She wouldn't know decency if it slapped her in the face and said 'HELLO, IM DECENCY!'   This is the woman who stood by her man right up until she realised it's going to F up her career, then dropped him like a lead balloon. Moral compass of a black hole<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#mondaythoughts Could reason Tories don't want kids from underprivileged backgrounds going Uni &amp; sabotaged with algorithm is much simpler than first thought. Money. Loads don't go = less student finance to hand out. DO. THE. MATHS. Big numbers  #ALevelProtests @lewis_goodall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#mondaythoughts   If anyone wanted a window into how Tories are handling Brexit trade negotiations, just take a look at the complete fiasco of how they've dealt with A-level results. Shambolic is being very, very polite  #ALevelProtests #ALevelResults<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Monday morning Irony from Tory govt 🙄 Apparently THEY'RE 'FRAUDULENT &amp; CORRUPT' and UK not having it🤦🏻‍♂️  #mondaythoughts #Belarus   https://t.co/PG1U8Fiqql<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CliveWismayer Probably something about he bought another pair of coloured chinos🤷🏻‍♂️ Or maybe, his German passport application has been knocked back. you know, the one that allows HIM unfettered EU access, but one he's denied everyone else and he's gonna slag off Gnädige Merkel🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whiterabbit3128 @LeftieShaney @LeftWingSociety Ok, so in other words, no matter what Corbyn did, he was going to lose anyhow, yes?🤔  So what's all the fuss about then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSocialistDad @Keir_Starmer All he had to do was sit tight. Johnson's Tories with no majority would have folded. Imagine him with no majority during pandemic. Many decisions would have been made better for public as numbers were with opp. All JC did was hand BJ a free ride. If anyone is to blame, it's him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not having a go at anyone in particular but WTF is going on .@UKLabour  .@labourpress?? You guys are almost anonymous. Tories are handing you their arses on a plate *DAILY* &amp; yet no one is really attacking? What's going on??  #SundayThoughts @DavidLammy @Keir_Starmer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeftieShaney @LeftWingSociety Yaaay!  Then what, try change leader and then lose another GE? Going for a hattrick?? Delusional🤦🏻‍♂️ Did Corbyn won anything besides his own seat &amp; leadership election?? 2 x GE, EU Ref, 2 x Local elections &amp; MEP elections - all massive defeats. Take the hint<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NatalieElphicke 🙄🤦🏻‍♂️ Why would anyone listen to you? Your morals are there for all to see. Stand by your man only until he's found guilty, then dump him ASAP for your career.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSocialistDad @Keir_Starmer FFS 🙄 Says the guy who's hero Corbyn fell for Johnson's goading &amp; handed worst lab result since 1935 &amp; 80 odd seat majority to him on a plate🤦🏻‍♂️ You guys had 2 GE attempts &amp; effed up both times.  Morals don't even come into it until you're in power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomTugendhat Delusional, lack self awareness and corrupt - that's what you and your colleagues are. Everything your party has done with Ref &amp; Brexit is a slap in the face for all those who struggled and died during WW2.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Priorities 🤦🏻‍♂️😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage What a load of bollocks More humiliating is you, pretending that things are really bad when in reality it's nothing compared to your fraud &amp; corruption. We see you. We know. #DodgyNige<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JJHTweets @BorisJohnson I'm going with...  https://t.co/qDLpYXDSxf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eddystone506 I asked the very same yesterday. Seems dinghies narrative was the distraction<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer Time to ramp up Sir Keir. Just this week they've given us dinghies distraction, then A-level results fiasco &amp; now France quarantine. All are complete jokes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have to wonder logic of Johnson's Govt telling us v important news like a 14-day #Quarantine when returning from France - AT 10PM!!  Wth were they doing all day??🤨 Same other week with Mcr /WYorks lockdown - 9.16pm via Twitter.  Sweep under the rug at night?🤔  #FridayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MartinRemains We didn't have to wait long 😉 They always have a back balls-up ready<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fbpe_jojo77 They preempted - France😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@BorisJohnson - 'How can I distract everyone from our shambolic #AlevelResults balls-up?' Cummings - 'France 😉' Johnson - 'Jolly good ol chap! C'est très bien!'  #FridayThoughts #Quarantine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tellthenation1 @JohnBishop100 @frankcottrell_b See my previous answer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WHEN are folk going to WAKE the F up &amp; revolt against Shyster Johnson's Govt?? Lies, Deceit, Incompetence Scandal &amp; Corruption,  started with illegal proroguing, Brexit  shambles, Lockdown, CummingsGate, PPE, Care Home Deaths &amp; now A-level results. JUST WHEN?? #FridayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tellthenation1 @JohnBishop100 @frankcottrell_b The irony in this tweet is strong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GuzKhanOfficial Sorry for your nieces temporary heartache.  Punch a Tory? Nah, they're not worth the effort. Lulis all of them.  Better would be if the youth used Tiktok or Snapchat or whatever and got a massive movement going.  They'd need a leader, Guzman🤔 (I could assist 😉👍🏽)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seems with the migrant distraction, A level results a and covid fiasco, everyone's forgotten about the Tory MP who's STILL not been suspended from his job, pending a full investigation.  #ThursdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This whole 14 day quarantine thing is a load of Bollocks. No one's asking. No one's checking.  It's just usual Tory scare tactics. They're not really bothered, They just pretend they are   #ThursdayThought<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If I was a .@Conservatives MP, I'd genuinely be worried. Maybe not now, but defo for future. All the 18yr olds whose future you've effed up today, are eligible to vote at next GE, as will their parents.  Now what do you think they're going to do🤔  #AlevelResults #torychaos<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickDayPA @GavinWilliamson @BorisJohnson Unbelievable! I'm raging for you 🤬 My kids are past that -Thankfully - my youngest was last year, but still feels so real. So sorry. Tell her to hang in there. It may take an appeal or even another year, but it'll be worth it.  Keep strong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RuthDavidsonMSP apply same logic to your Tory mate, Fireplace salesman Williamson. He's as shit as it gets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinWilliamson Fireplace salesman strikes again 🤦🏻‍♂️  Is this tweet aimed at private schools, you know, the ones the algorithm protected but gave a triple AAA student at a state school ABD instead?   To say you've been promoted above your level is putting it mildly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TiceRichard @benandjerrys What a complete moron🙄🤦🏻‍♂️  Don't like being told by a tub of cookie dough why you're such a xenophobe, is that what it is?😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>To put #COVID19 in perspective,  in the UK, we have 1-2 average sized planes worth of people, sadly dying every week. The EU/Europe doesn't even have half a plane.

<|startoftext|>Exactly 👍🏽 And why they kept it quiet till now? Summer hols! No HoC, No urgent questions, No scrutiny = less pressure. It's a complete mockery. All involved need suspending immediately &amp;  .@Keir_Starmer .@DavidLammy need to be all over this #TuesdayThoughts<|endoftext|>

Agree to WA with EU, get through parl P2 - 31st Jan - Brexit P3 -  30th June -  pass transition extension date P4 - Now. Blame EU, lay foundations for breaking WA P5 - No deal  OR...

<|startoftext|>Genuine question. Is it legal for death sec  @MattHancock to announce a change to the law on twitter, on a Thurs night, before the guidance and law has been published or changed? #lockdownextension @DavidLammy @Keir_Starmer @JolyonMaugham @davidallengreen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>G Mcr &amp; W Yorks family lockdown, tweeted at 9.16pm Thurs night by Death Sec Mancock, has nothing, absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with ruining Eid, which is happening 3hrs later on Fri where millions of UK Muslim families get together. PURE COINCIDENCE🙄 #lockdownextension<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doesn't affect me but families from Gr Mcr or W Yorks, if get asked by police just tell them you got an urgent childcare issue &amp; also need to check your eyesight. If they need any further info, contact Mr D Cummings, 10 DowningStreet. He knows😉 #lockdownextension #lockdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man breaks lockdown, drives 250mls to his 2nd home &amp; see mum for her b/day, drives another 60mls to 'check his eyesight' &amp; celebrate wife's birthday.  Govt - all good  Families told can meet in gardens &amp; indoors  Govt - you didn't follow the rules!  #lockdown #FridayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Basically Govt said yesterday evening  'we haven't got a clue what we're doing, we're just winging it'  #lockdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattHancock You're looking at data at 9pm and made a spur of the moment decision by announcing on twitter, rather than on live TV?? Muppets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THIS is why they've done the lockdown at short notice. So Govt can blame people celebrating #EidAlAdha as cause for rate rise. Now it's official, easier to redirect blame  #ToryShambles #lockdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For anyone in any doubt, this is not the coming of the 2nd wave as Muppet Johnson and Capt Cockhan would have you believe, this is STILL THE FIRST!!   They're lying to us again  #lockdown #lockdownextension<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@msjanebond007 @cirian75 Which comes from the Eliiots...😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CrednesCodPeace @radicleray Agree. This is more than party politics. What Cameron, May &amp; Johnson (&amp; Gove) have done is allowed these things to flourish unchecked. 'Most' have benefitted them. If it was JC or any other leader, same should happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PMQs *Hypocrisy Alert* Johnson accuses Starmer of being Islington remoaner elite. Johnson used to live in...Islington! (until became PM) Also, he wrote 2 articles - one for Remain, one for Leave - before deciding leave suited his personal ambition to become PM #RussiaReport<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mgacramer @Keir_Starmer I just said the same elsewhere. Hugely frustrating, and in no part thanks to JC &amp; Co. BJ will BS, talk bluster &amp; bollocks for 4 more years, change laws &amp; do almost what he likes. And what can we do about it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@BorisJohnson goes on about Labour MPs going on RT. He needs to look closer to home🙄 Although they're all in it as traitors so no surprise  #PMQs #RussiaReport  #RussianInterference<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acmtix @Keir_Starmer We do. But how?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PolitikInk @politicshome @AngelaRayner @Keir_Starmer Did you read my tweet?🤨 They're in power BECAUSE of your lot!!🤦🏻‍♂️😂 You enabled Tories for another 5yrs by agreeing to GE, then JC FAILED to convince the public. In fact he lost 60 odd seats!!🤦🏻‍♂️ How's that 'onside against tories'?? 🤨🤦🏻‍♂️😂 You're living in la-la land<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PolitikInk @politicshome @AngelaRayner He got goaded &amp; bullied into GE by BJ, one he couldn't win, &amp; country didn't stand by him either at GEs. Twice. Add to that Remain &amp; Local election losses, also twice, shows not v good at it.  He's had his Go.  Enough now pls. Get onside against Tories, or move aside.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's about time .@UKLabour  .@theSNP .@LibDems got their heads together. The Tories are corrupt, this much is clear. Rest need to work together for national interest #PMQs #RussiaReport #RussianInterference<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PMQs  If there's a 'possibility', just a possibility, that a foreign country has interfered with democratic processes in the UK, why wouldn't Govt want to look into that?🤔 Unless of course they are  part of it, or minimum, beneficiaries🧐  #RussiaReport #RussianInterference<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrissieGrech @BBCRadio4 They have zero self awareness🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acmtix @Keir_Starmer He didnt. He did what he could but Johnson is a slippery snake who has been helped to a 80 seat majority by goading JC into an GE he could never win and then lying to public (BJ) sKS is doing what he can within what he has<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PMQs  Keri Starmer absolutely smashed Johnson 😂 'This is the journalist who wrote 2 articles for everything!' Brilliant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PMQs  Johnson has nothing. Nothing.  Just prepared lines, as Sir Keir points out  I'm am furious at how stupid Johnson thinks we are.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Any Tory MP who supports Johnson &amp; Gove now are effectively accomplices to #RussianInterference   #RussiaReport #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PMQs  Someone (not Starmer) Should ask BJ in HoC if he attended Russian oligarch's party in Italy as Foreign Sec *without bodyguards*, man who owns Evening standard &amp; who's dad is close to Putin. And then caught an easyJet home, as foreign sec, with no protection? #RussiaReport<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Theresa May is as guilty as  Johnson &amp; Gove. She could have become a hero by investigating but chose party over country. Traitor. Irony is she sacked Patel for treasonous acts but was herself neck deep.  #RussiaReport #WednesdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABridgen No but will you accept you're a Russian stooge, because knowingly or unknowingly, that's what you are. A traitor  #RussiaBoughtBrexit #RussiaReport<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time to wake up @UKLabour. Time to call out the treason of the Tories  #RussiaReport #RussianInterference #RussiaBoughtBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Flip it. Imagine Remain won #EUref then Labour won GE &amp; in report transpires Russian oligarchs making donations to Corbyn, McDonnell, Starmer etc &amp; interfered with UK GEs/Refs. What d'you think Tories/ RW media would be doing right now🧐🤔 #RussiaReport #PMQs  #WednesdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Telegraph headline - Britain 'close' to abandoning hope of Brexit trade deal. Close? Means they already have. Hope?? Never was any, just lies. Johnson &amp; Gove are PROVEN liars of biggest set of shyster Tory MPs this country has known.  EVER.  #WednesdayThoughts #RussiaReport<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Russia work on #EUref. Leave win. BJ nearly PM, becomes For Sec. Mi6 says something odd, told by BJ don't go there. TM knew too but blind eyes it. Tories continue to take Russian donations. BJ attends oligarch parties off book. Made PM.  Delays #RussiaReport  #WednesdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If anyone compares Johnson to Churchill again, in the famous words of @Tyson_Fury, they are gettin it!  @BorisJohnson is a traitor who's sold out his country.  Brexit is built on deception &amp; interference, and he knew it   #RussiaReport #ToryCorruption<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's be frank, last 4 years and especially the last 24hrs, were built on: LIES  DECEPTION MANIPULATION  INTERFERENCE Today's report confirms what we knew all along. Tories are #corrupt &amp; have sold out their country for a profit  #RussiaReport #Brexit #ToryCorruption #ToryLies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AgiBergman @cirian75 @carolecadwalla @BorisJohnson Which in other words meant, if I release this now, we will most likely lose the election, or have a hung parliament at the very minimum.  What he did is dither, stall &amp; delay it for as long as possible to get past the 30th June (transition extension date)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anybody defending Tories for not investigating Russian interference in GE's &amp; #EUref is essentially working with/for Russian plotters, or AT THE VERY LEAST, happy for them to do so as result suits their agenda #RussiaReport #TuesdayThoughts  @nicktolhurst @mi6rogue @BettGunther<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@B_E_Andre In BP terms, over 200<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Johnson is in it eyebrow deep   #ToryTraitors #RussiaReport<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's release of #RussiaReport confirms that previous &amp; current Tory govt didn't have the national interest at heart. Only their own  #TuesdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>May, Johnson &amp; Gove have committed Treason.  #RussiaReport<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In my humble opinion, every General election /Referendum from 2014 onwards is tainted with the stench of corruption &amp; interference. They didn't investigate bc they didn't want people to see what they already knew.  #RussiaReport  #TuesdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tories delayed releasing  #RussiaReport till after General Election. Any wonder? If it had come out before, they'd most probably have lost.  THEY KNEW THIS. Therefore GE result is tainted, almost Null &amp; Void, and any decisions they've taken in last 7mths are tainted too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tories have done a Trump!  Trump - when we test, we find more cases   Tories - if we search for Russian interference, we'll find it. Don't look for it, we won't find it😉  #TuesdayThought #EUref #RussiaReport<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tory party have committed Treason.  #RussiaReport #TuesdayThought  #Traitors<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right now, Boris Johnson is 💩 it He's hoping nobody realises he was made the Foreign Sec by Theresa May after the #EUref  The Foreign sec is in charge of MI6, which investigates foreign interference.  #RussiaReport<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Johnson's still a liar. Well I never 😲🤦🏻‍♂️ #RussianReport<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FFS 🙄 Govt 'Actively Avoided' investigating Russian interference. Actively avoided?!? That in layman's terms means they went 'OUT OF THEIR WAY' to make sure it didn't happen #ReleaseTheRussiaReport<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Join The Dots. Tory party receive massive donations from Russians, Tory party turns a blind eye to their interference in UK politics.  #TuesdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NOT. ROCKET. SCIENCE. Johnson's Govt, and May's &amp; Cameron's before, ARE CORRUPT. That's what report tells us. They didn't want Russia interference in #EURef investigated. WHY?🤔 BC Russians with access to top in Kremlin, make massive donations to Tory party. #TuesdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surprise,surprise🙄 Tories DIDN'T ASK  intelligence agencies to investigate if Russia had messed in EU referendum, even though evidence points to they had. Can anyone think of a reason why they wouldn't want that🧐 #RussiaReport #TuesdayThoughts  https://t.co/OGn4N4OcNq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrewrobertso5 @LFC There's this guy, massive LFC fan of 40 odd yrs, been there through thick n thin, it would make his day/week/month/year if he won 😉@nisarmir21<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JJHTweets Basically comes down to one vote evey 5 yrs (and even that they may try take away eventually) They're perfecting the art &amp; narrowing the field. Now after last night's vote, if they can lie/manipulate to public &amp; win like they did Ref &amp; 2019, they can do whatever with no scrutiny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When Tories said 'Take back control', they didn't mean from EU, meant us, Gen public. Now they've won right to NOT allow trade deals to be voted on in HoC, they can do whatever they like &amp; no one can do anything. Sounds like 1930s Germany.  Next? No GEs #TuesdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Johnson said NHS will get £350m a week? More like that's what Tory party will be getting when it's sold off🙄 #TuesdayThoughts<|endoftext|>

His coded message to followers got through B. He's a shit leader that no one listen to C. Prob both  #SundayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomTugendhat Same thing?? Not even same vicinity🤦🏻‍♂️ Yesterday - 99% of white men were looking for confrontations. And what exactly was their cause? Seriously you lot need to hire mini bus, with Cummings as driver (not his wife) and take a 60mile trip somewhere to check your eyesight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Femi_Sorry Literally thousands of men descended on London looking for one thing &amp; one thing only - violence. Not sure why .@BBCNews would call them protesters, or even counter-protesters? Protesting against what exactly? A statue being boarded up to protect &amp; preserve it?? 🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WestminsterWAG Is this your Jekyll and Hyde moment?  Seems so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesCleverly Distraction tactics🙄  Can't help thinking if Not-So turned up at #londonriots yesterday, where lads who voted for his beloved Tory party &amp; Brexit, were pissing all over parliament square. They'd have kicked the crap out of him! Not for his views, but bc he's black. Fact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SundayThoughts You know when certain moments/things happen in history, and then there's an image that is synonymous with it? This is one of those. #londonprotests #londonriots #BlackLivesMatter  https://t.co/e4az4bRivv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#WheresBoris   Probably pissed up somewhere with the London lads who were 'protecting' his hero  #londonprotests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jennyflower  https://t.co/sJ53peYDZm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's see how many of protesters in London today get kettled by Police in Whitehall, like those last wkend from 8pm till 2am, have no water, food or use of facilities for 6hrs, then have photo &amp; details taken before released. Highly. Doubt. It. #SaturdayMorning #londonprotests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesCleverly Enablers and it's All on your lot. You must be proud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Otto_English @BorisJohnson He's got Priti '3000, 40,000, and 79' Patel to do it instead. He's too busy anyhow. Downing his bottle in Downing Street<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IainDale True, but they're YOUR sides thugs 😉 This is what you and your likes have empowered &amp; created. So now *own it*, don't disown it. Why did you think, all little Englanders were white, 50 plus couples and stay at home types?🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeoffBarton9 @ScarthLloyd They're probably under the masks as well. But a lot further back because they don't want to break their nails<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>WT😱🙄🤦🏻‍♂️ Definition of stupid irony. Men / Lads with ENGLAND SHIRTS, doing NAZI SALUTES, claming to be there to *PROTECT* the Cenotaph &amp; Churchill's statue, who helped defeat the....NAZIS! #SaturdayThoughts #londonprotests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Make no mistake, this is EXACTLY what  .@BorisJohnson &amp; Cummings wanted when speaking out yesterday. Anything to distract from 65,000 covid deaths, economy on its arse and brexit transition  #SaturdayThoughts #londonprotests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sums it up perfectly #London #BlackLivesMatterUK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GuzKhanOfficial  https://t.co/NZLmZFDsXR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tyson_Fury @BorisJohnson Tyson, he's a hypocrite, don't be sucked in🙄 When he was Mayor of London, he covered statues up to protect as well. Numerous times. right &amp; sensible thing to do. Now a *Mayor Of Colour* for London does the same, he turns it around and stokes tension unnecessarily.Don't be fooled<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson's list: Statues End lockdown to boost economy &amp; kill some more, #NoDealBrexit to serve his bosses, UK-USA deal to appease RW  Not on list: 41k deaths &amp; rising 24k Care home deaths 2nd wave Public Enquiry Russia report CumGate #BlackLivesMatter  #SaturdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@BorisJohnson  Curious🤔  was the Churchill statue ever boarded up for any protests, when you were Mayor of London?  Just asking on behalf of a nation tired of your smoke &amp; mirrors BS  #BlackLivesMatter #London #Hypocrisy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This  #BlackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pritipatel Don't remember you saying this when thousands upon thousands (majority white folf) descended on beaches and parks week after #CumGate 🤔  Standard hypocrisy and shysterism from a coconut  #BlackLivesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NadineDorries As opposed to 'Hard right is part of Brexit Matters' 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Curious 🤔 Often wonder what Tory voters think when they see stuff like this. Does it bother them but sweep under carpet &amp; deny ever voting blue for not wanting to look stupid?  Or do they accept it's part of what they do &amp; are - Lying, duplicitous Toe rags?  #SaturdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarianMain @BettGunther Exactly that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@David_Leavitt I always find these *types* have zero self awareness &amp; full on hypocrites.  Like here, being racist to a man of asian descent - whilst driving a car made by a Japanese firm. 🤨🤦🏻‍♂️  #BlackLivesMatter  https://t.co/cP1Wjsd6vN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cool, but thought Political messages were outlawed in football? People tried in past - wrist slapped.  Guardiola with Catalan ribbon - ticked off.  Why about Syria, or Palestine? Nothing.  #BlackLivesMatter #SaturdayThoughts   https://t.co/Yjye6Vm0TY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adilray So, so true 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@antoguerrera You know it's not permanent?? The way you're crying is making out it is. It's actually the right and sensible thing to do. But right and Sensible are probably not 'cool words' these days<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chrisballingall Same, along with Raab. The rest of them are just useful Muppets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidHenigUK Not very useful???🙄 Literally *millions* of lives are going to be *negatively* affected &amp; people realising and objecting to it are smeared with 3 words??

<|startoftext|>@michaelgove @MarosSefcovic One thing's for certain, there won't be any statues for you &amp; Johnson🤦🏻‍♂️ In future, history will say how were this pair of absolute numpties ever allowed at top of govt? 65k #COVID19 deaths &amp; counting on your watch, and now the economy about to go into tail spin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, these are same people who were in charge &amp; responsible for policy that has lead to 65,000 deaths of UK citizens in last 10 weeks. I wouldn't trust them to run a bath.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This on the day it was announced our economy shrink by 20% in April!! And 99.9999999% of economists predict it's only gonna get worse with no deal brexit. We're screwed😱  #ExtendTransition #EU<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AntTheBug23 Not really. Can't be bothered with child like you who's missing whole point🙄 Institutional racism in police 100% exists.

<|startoftext|>@AntTheBug23 Facts not feeling. Brown Man won't move his legally parked car so THREE police officers take him down, because he chatted back? Not an overreaction by police?

<|startoftext|>@HTrebles @mcash 1. Daughter. She's in car. 2. Wife, not his mum. 3. Would they have reacted like this for white person?  Nope. And that's #BlackLivesMatter In a nutshell. Different rules. If you can't see Police are overreacting &amp; wrong (for blue badge??) then really no hope for people like you<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#DailyBriefing  Word is Boris Johnson says he will self isolate if Alok Sharma tests positive for #coronavirus  Why?🤔 I though he'd already had it 🤨 Does this mean he's not immune, or maybe he didn't have it in first place🤔 Something is dodgy, as ever   #BorisJohnsonFailedUk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Good thread👍🏼👏🏼 Brexit is happening. No one can stop that. But we must do Sensible &amp; Right thing by extending transition and getting right trade deals in place. To not would mean No Deal Brexit = Disaster for all bar those who've bet on it #WednesdayThoughts #ExtendTransition<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>24,000 EXTRA deaths of our loved ones in 8wk period compared to average year. Actual total of #COVID19 deaths in UK near 65,000 😱 Shift of elderly patients from Hosp to care caused this.

<|startoftext|>@KateWilton1 @surrey21lady @updayUK Agreed. Literally making it up as go along. But all this is a distraction from ultimate aim. Brexit transition extension date 30/06. No extension = No Deal Brexit.  Lockdown eased so people's minds elsewhere. Imagine #covid spike in 3-4 weeks, what'll people be thinking about?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shocking beyond words😱 Attacked for nothing more than driving down the street🤬 But what's more shocking is car in front which is doing same thing. The difference?  One in front has white occupants.  #BlackLivesMatter #GeorgeFloyd    https://t.co/vmFVI7QrA7<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wait, what?🤨 .@BorisJohnson allows vulnerable people out (L1) but admits we're still at L4, which by THEIR OWN standard = back into lockdown?🤔 Seems #HerdImmunity back on menu folks.

<|startoftext|>@Haggis_UK From my limited experience of dealing with people (i.e. lots), when person says 'to be honest with you', esp mid sentence, tells me they're lying or at least hiding something. And he does multiple times. Bear in mind he's solicitor by trade and it all adds up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NadineDorries When will DC admit that the cottage is his, not his dad's (see land registry) and he went up north because it was was his mum's BD and Easter, or he went to bc as was his wife's BD? Or his cottage is illegally built as no planning permission, not paying council btax<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dontbrexitfixit @MattHancock He's MP for Newmarket. That's got nothing to do with this wonderful news.

<|startoftext|>@MoS_Politics Good. Admitted &amp; resigned. Did the honourable thing.

<|startoftext|>Cummings lies about childcare trip to Durham (Mum's bd/Easter), 'Dad's farm' (his too = 2nd home), trip to Barnard castle (wife's bd), now find out been building without planning &amp; not paying council tax!

<|startoftext|>@AndyBurnhamGM My thoughts exactly 🙄  It's like they don't hear their own voice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is it when I type 'Test', it comes up with 'Twat' as an option 🤔🤷🏻‍♂️😂  #NotMovingOn #dailybreifing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cummings presents himself as man against system.Yet went to private school, then Oxford, no real jobs, PM's chief advisor, owns a farm &amp; married to daughter of man who owns castle &amp; is a Baronet. If that's 'Anti-establishment', fook knows what pro establishment is🧐 #NotMovingOn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One thing realised this last week, it's Cummings is not genius he or some think he is.  He's a Lying, Posh-Boy Charlatan who's played public for fools, relying most are too blind/thick &amp; don't give sh*t other than end lockdown so can go meet family mates &amp; pub.  #NotMovingOn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not how many tests, it's how many people get tested. Multiple tests on one person shouldn't be counted, nor should 'it's in the post so that's another' However Johnson's lot have &amp; will continue to lie about this too #dailybreifing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spot on Justin*👏🏼👍🏼 Cummings is a Liar, pure &amp; simple. know you can't say so I'll do for you😉 He went up north to spend Easter at HIS 2nd home (not his dad's) &amp; went to Barnard castle as wife's bd. THAT'S the REAL truth. #dailybreifing *Is your middle name 'Hulk Smash' ?😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@syksey9 @Adam_P_W @pauladunstable @ThatTimWalker Not saying masks are the answer but making compulsory if out for more than certain time surely helps. It's more of a visual / aesthetic thing. Wearing one keeps people on their toes, and those around. Not wearing = they will forget &amp; think all's good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@syksey9 @Adam_P_W @pauladunstable @ThatTimWalker You're using USA as an example?🤦🏻‍♂️ 2 country's you're defending (UK &amp; USA) have HIGHEST total of CV19 DEATHS IN WORLD.

<|startoftext|>Exactly.👏🏼👍🏼 Been saying same for last 7 days. Seem we're (twitter) only ones saying this. No journos asking questions have asked. Why?

<|startoftext|>@syksey9 @Adam_P_W @pauladunstable @ThatTimWalker And yet virtually all other countries in the world - with democratic Govts - HAVE told their population to wear them🤔 Which makes me wonder, Why can't our govt &amp; more to point, why can't we listen? if we can stay indoors for a few weeks, surely can wear mask for few mins, no?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WTF IT'S A FRICKIN OUTRAGEOUS!!! Johnson &amp; Cummings are literally sentencing people to death!  They must be removed ASAP Pls do something @Keir_Starmer before it's too late   #BorisJohnsonMustGo #CummingsOut #Covid19UK #covid<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Extraordinary like 60k deaths, 2nd highest death toll in world  .@Helen_Whately ?

Very Odd you'd admit (cover) using word extraordinary? #FridayThoughts #BorisJohnsonMustGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe .@didoharding should let UK public what the hell is going on.  Given she was in charge of TalkTalk when it had a massive data breach, not exactly reassuring  #FridayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a side note, she's married to a Tory MP and  also on the board at Cheltenham race course, which allowed race festival to go ahead with 250,000 visitors THE WEEK BEFORE  lockdown, despite calls for it to be called off due to #COVID19 🤔🤔  #JustSayin #NHSTestAndTrace<|endoftext|>

However, when you consider USA has 300m population with 100k deaths, UK's 66m with 60k is actually by far the worst. TRY IGNORING THAT #dailyupdate #sackDominicCummings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrjamesob @campbellclaret @krishgm @carolecadwalla @nazirafzal @EmmaKennedy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@BorisJohnson  If the R rate is hovering close to 1(up from when you released), infection rates are going up &amp; daily death rates are not going down, Why are you loosening lockdown?  If there is a spike in 2-3 weeks, make no mistake, you are solely responsible  #dailyupdate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did anyone actually feel sorry for Laura Kunessburg today at #DailyBreifing I did.  For about 0.01 of a sec.  Today she learnt the hard way. They have no loyalty. They will cut you loose if you start to ask the wrong questions.  #sackDominicCummings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NHSTestAndTrace   'Hi I'm calling from test &amp; trace team, can you confirm your date of birth and address please' What??! As if this system is not open to fraudsters 😲🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrismiller_uk Not accidentally, deliberately<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uk has highest death per million in world and 2nd highest deaths in the world from #COVID19  Boris Johnson - Let's ease lockdown and open our schools! 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤬  #DailyUpdate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Infections are up, deaths are not down, yet now our PM thinks we should ease lockdown. I wonder why  #dailyupdate #DominicCummings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MackemScouse @Keir_Starmer He is but like a good QC, he's taking notes &amp; letting them bury themselves. Anything said in HoC is on record and bozo is screwed. anything said outside isn't. Next week's PMQs 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DailyUpdate  Seems to me Johnson is fast tracking relaxing of lockdown to take focus totally away from Cummings &amp; saving his own neck. Even if this means more people will suffer and lose their lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MackemScouse @Keir_Starmer He's waiting for parliament to open next week<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>W.T.A.F  Any wonder DomCum is his son in law  #DailyUpdate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mvrander @Otto_English Nearly threw mine. What a twat he is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#dailyupdate  Cutting journos off and not answering questions is now the norm for not just for BoJo, but also CSA &amp; CMO. Pointless briefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 A better response may have been 'Usually, but I'm...'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the actual F 😲😱 #ThursdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone contacted by a tracer and told to stay home, just tell them Dom said it was reasonably &amp; legally ok to crack on. Also verified by Johnson and the whole cabinet  #ThursdayThoughts  #OneRule4ThemAnother4Us<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aggressie @nomadreturns @DurhamPolice @Keir_Starmer @DavidLammy @BBC @maitlis Exactly. Live on air, by the head of BBC.  But they won't, he's a Tory Stooge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@MattHancock, the DEATH SECRETARY   No more words needed.  #ThursdayThoughts  #AllLivesMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No way😲 #ThursdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ThursdayThoughts Imagine Death Secretary @MattHancock this morning before he went on TV. He was so happy. Prob as congratulated his team on getting UK to 1st in world per million deaths &amp; 2nd in total number from #COVID19. What a job he &amp; boss @BorisJohnson have done.  😥🙏🏼🤲🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elisled2 Wow, now that is VERY interesting 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I still don't get why no one is stating the obvious. It was his mum's birthday that week, it was Easter few days after, these are the real REASONS for going up north. Everything else is just bullshit to cover it up   #SackCummings  #JohnsonMustGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the trip up to Durham wasn't a breach, with himself, wife &amp; kid possibly infected, but the trip to Barnard castle with dodgy / weird eyes to test his driving was, but only minor, again where all possibly infected? 🧐 #sackcummings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cirian75 Took the words out of my mouth 👍🏼  Although deansgate? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This 👇🏼😉😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now @DurhamPolice have down right thing &amp; at least said HE BROKE THE LAW, thereby CONTRADICTING what Johnson, Gove, Hancock, Braverman et al have been saying, HEADS MUST ROLL. Starting with plaintiff no.1 #DominicCummings Over to you @Keir_Starmer @DavidLammy   #ThursdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Puzzled 🧐 According to @DurhamPolice If driving 60 miles during a lockdown is a *minor* breach, WTH is a major one?? If anyone else had done it and got pulled, would we have fined - Yes or No?   I think we all know the answer. #sackcummings  #Dominicummings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd like think the BBC are feeling quite stupid now it's come out that Cummings DID break the law = @maitlis was right 👍🏼👏🏼💪🏼 But arrogant as they are, I doubt it #sackcummings #CumGate #DominicCummingsMustGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andreajenkyns Police just said Cummings broke the law. Enough!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well well well  Dominic Cummings did breach lockdown rules, Durham police say.  https://t.co/dzSwUKuTHR  via @GoogleNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@R00pert @mrjamesob The thing which could swing it is this. Any who have spoken out against Cummings are now in his cross hairs. If they back down now, they know, at some point in the future, he will defo come for them. So they need to see it through, for their own sake. Sh*t or bust as it were!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrjamesob Which is enough.  People forget. Take 41 from Johnson's 80 majority and then he's NOT got a majority.  365 - 41 = 324 Majority is 326.  All it takes are *at least* 41 'half decent' Tories (is that poss?) and it starts to crumble<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>'Unlikely' whole workplaces will be told to self-isolate  Which begs the questions. Why bother?🤨 How the eff do you expect it  to work if you're doing a 'pick n choose' approach 🤔  #NHSTestAndTrace #ThursdayThoughts   https://t.co/9yxQdrhArc<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Come on Ben, it's the old Tory favourite - smoke &amp; mirrors BoJo will say/do anything to distract from. Even a half baked test &amp; trace  #dominiccummings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I for one, am totally flabbergasted that this new system is not working on time🤦🏻‍♂️ #NHS #TestAndTrace #dominiccumnings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @MattHancock Death Secretary Matt Hancock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Death Secretary  .@MattHancock Sounds much more appropriate for him. Good one Tim😉 #ThursdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DKShrewsbury @maitlis This is probably a polite way of saying 'Thank fook for that. I'm s**t scared of her &amp; glad don't have to make a complete fool of myself.  Again'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@MattHancock wants us to do our 'Civic Duty' with #NHSTestAndTrace by staying at home when asked to. Really?🤨  Like ur boss #Cummings did by driving 260 miles for his Mum's birthday &amp; spend Easter with family, with AT LEAST ONE infected with #COVID19?🧐 #ThursdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*Darth Vader voice*  'The irony is strong in this one' 😉😂 #DominicCummnings #sackcummings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sara_Rose_G  https://t.co/r0cGrEzZGk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Asking Johnson questions be like: Is it daytime? BJ - blah blah blah Ooo look clouds Do you like to eat chicken? BJ - Blah x3 everyone should have 3 meals per day Should there be more females in Politics? BJ - Blah x3 er..is that the time?  NEVER answers the question🤦🏻‍♂️ Pathetic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*Breaking*  CCTV footage of Dominic Cummings heading to Barnard castle leaks  #cummingsmustgo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MahyarTousi Of course she is 🙄  https://t.co/kuZDYTmzGA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Simple but effectively put 👍🏼 Not one of journos or senior MPs have even questioned/thought of that.

<|startoftext|>No way!!😲🧐 #WednesdayThoughts #cummnings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If his name is on the deeds, he owns it (as well) Therefore a second home. Therefore he broke the rules. #COVID__19 #SackCmmings<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Couldn't agree more.  #DominicCummngs #CumGate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leigh_lou @Keir_Starmer Not really. letting Tories put all their arguments out in open/bury themselves, biding his time &amp; making notes as a good QC should. He's releasing some tweets &amp; statements but main point is, HoC closed this week, therefore can't hit target directly until next wed for max effect😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have a look, give it a go, retweet Thanks #CumGate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*Also, mir in your name too 😉💪🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This explains exactly why Cummings is still there. It goes deep, very deep. No wonder Gove will brazenly Lie about driving 60 miles to test his eyes too🙄🤦🏻‍♂️🤬 Well done 👏🏼👍🏼 &amp; Keep up the fight Shahmir* 💪🏼👍🏼  #sackDominicCummngs #WednesdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@faisalislam Funnily enough I've been thinking this for weeks, even tweeted about, but in my case, I put it on Corbyn for being bullied into GE by Johnson. But the principle is the same. Minority govt with this backdrop? Would have crumbled<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Way I see it, if Cummings goes, so does Johnson &amp; all on inner circle. There's no way they can defend the Sh*t of out him &amp; situation for days, Only to then turn around &amp; say 'he's done the right thing'.  Not this time. House of cards.  Whole deck must fall  #sackDominicCummngs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent analysis, Well worth a read. 👏🏼👍🏼  Takes apart whole DC line &amp; exposes him for what he is. A lying hypocrite with shocking judgement.  #sackDominicCummngs #DailyBriefinguk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BethRigby Tory word of the week - Reasonably  Followed closely by  Legally<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I lived in N London near Cummings and I saw him walking down the road, I'd be asking him one question. Just one. Was it your wife's birthday on the day you went to Barnard castle? His whole deck of lies collapses   #sackDominicCummngs #dominiccunmings #DailyBriefinguk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The plot thickens🤨 Imagine, just imagine, if this turned out to be true? Cummings, Johnson, Gove et al would all fall  #sackDominicCummngs  #dominiccunmings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#cummmings 'People who know me would know I am not an authority on driving' Gove on @LBC trying to get out of explaining why DC drove 60 miles to test his eyes. And yet we're expected to accept Gove's an authority on *Everything Else* - as a journalist?🤔 #sackDominicCummngs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As far I'm aware, doing a 60 mile round trip with weird/dodgy eyesight with your 4yr old in the back is a safeguarding issue, no?  #sackDominicCummngs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShehabKhan @michaelgove All you needed to add was, was it his wife's birthday on that day.  And everything falls apart<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlokSharma_RDG Lying sleazeballs. All of you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Speaking with my bro from another mo @sday69 who's from Co.Durham. Says if there's one road you definitely WOULDN'T go &amp; test your eye sight on, its the road to Barnard castle!  Unless it wasn't an eye test run, rather Birthday one for Missus😉 #cummimgsout #sackDominicCummngs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>👍🏼😉😂 #CumGate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CumGate  My 2nd home is a bunch of concrete blocks. We call it a cottage. In Co Durham. On my Father's farm. Nearest neighbour is half a mile away. And we've got our own forrest.  Not privileged then 🙄  #dominiccummings #booforboris<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MackemScouse 👍🏼😉😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CumGate So just to be clear, if my eyes are weird / dodgy, I should drive 30miles / 45mins to see if they're ok?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CumGate  he keeps saying he didn't see his parents but how do we know? We have to take his word for it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CumGate  Did he drug his son or something, I mean he drove 5hrs / 260iles without stopping?? How many children can do that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CumGate   He's coming across as the posh boy he is. One rule for me, one for rule for you plebs.  Went to a '2nd home'  'Don't regret' 'No I disagree' 'Was a reasonable thing to drive 260 miles'  No contrition, No apology. Just No shits Given<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which is quite convenient as that's the chap who's filed a complaint against him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CumGate  The story breaks on Fri, AND THEN he goes to tell the Prime Minister, not a month ago<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CumGate  He can't remember if he did or didn't stop to fill up petrol on the way back, but he can remember *exactly* where he sat, for how long and the man who recognised him at Barnard castle 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Call me daft, but that doesn't seem like a reasonable thing to do, as he keeps saying?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CumGate  His vision was weird but shortly after, he drove 5hrs to London, therefore endangering other road users, if it was.  #DailyBriefings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MackemScouse He's a 🤬🤬🤬🤬 No respect for the public whatsoever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CumGate  His arrogance is staggering 🙄🤦🏻‍♂️ He just doesn't get it<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#CumGate  He took a 'short drive' to see if he could drive 5 hours🤦🏻‍♂️ What?? 🤨🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CumGate Boom! .@BethRigby just hit the nail on the head<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CumGate  Arrogance is his default mode, and he's slipping back into it during the questions<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nadhimzahawi FFS🤦🏻‍♂️ Thinks rules of lockdown don't apply to them, the elite, only everyone they tell. Literally *thousands" of examples of people who were in *EXACT SAME SITUATION* as DC, but guess what? They followed the rules &amp; stayed home. ZERO self awareness #dominiccummimgs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Johnson &amp; Cummings are Proven, Contemptuous,  Liars. In other news, water is wet.  #CummingsMustGo #dominiccummimgs #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nadhimzahawi @Keir_Starmer FFS these Muppets just don't know when to stop 🙄🤦🏻‍♂️ seems they were ok when they went to the castle 30 miles away from home in Durham 🤔 Liars lie &amp; cover up. Standard Nadhim policy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where's Laura?  #dominiccummimgs #DailyBriefings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DailyBriefings  Have wonder how stupid Johnson &amp; Cummings are if they think this is going away. It ain't anytime soon. DC will eventually be sidelined, but how does Bozo the clown wriggle out of this after staking everything on him. Beginning of end methinks #dominiccummimgs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DailyBriefing Unbelievable. Boris Johnson did what he said he would when he became PM.  Leave or Remain, he brought the country together. AGAINST HIM!  #dominiccummimgs #JohnsonMustGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DailyBriefings   .@BorisJohnson today lost the right to govern. He literally said one thing to all of us in March &amp; April, and then today, *totally disregarded* that to suit his boy Cummings story. Not just DC, Boris must go  Over to you .@Keir_Starmer  #dominiccummimgs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PendletonMartin @montie You sir, are an 🤦🏻‍♂️ PM said Stay At Home NO MATTER WHAT. DC had family &amp; friends in London, his wife too, for help with son. So what was need to drive 260 odd miles? I'll tell you 1. He thinks the rules don't apply to him 2. It was his mother's birthday that week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DailyBriefings  Listening to Sarah Jones on @BBCNews is making my blood boil. She is absolutely right. Parents of 13yr old Ismail who couldn't hold their sons hand whilst he was was dying or couldn't attend his funeral were also following rules. Why is Cummings so different??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lewis_goodall Good. Question.  Very. Good. Question<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ToryFibs My hunch is they're waiting to see what Johnson does/says today, And we'll see a response soon after<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DailyBriefings  Johnson is literally changing the rules during the presser to fit Cummings narrative<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DailyBriefings  Great questions by Channel 4 news. Exactly what I was thinking. Johnson is a complete a-hole. Cummings has big stuff on Bozo, that is all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DailyBriefings  Basically guys, we've all been given permission by the PM to do what the F we want!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DailyBriefings  Mate, No one is really interested in these graphs today. We already KNOW Johnson has effed that up.  #dominiccummimgs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DailyBriefings If you act like a contemptuous twat, in Johnson speak, that's integrity.  #dominiccummimgs #sackcummimgs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DailyBriefings  Wtf?? Cummings acted with integrity?? Doubling down. If it turns out that Cummings was in Durham for 2nd and 3rd time,  Johnson will be a goner too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DailyBriefing Never mind Cummings,  Johnson must go.  He is a complete an utter d*ckh*ad, no respect for what's happened, just blindly backing his guy.  #dominiccummimgs #sackcummimgs #JohnsonMustGo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PippaCrerar Because *maybe*, just maybe, they weren't as bad as were making out.

<|startoftext|>@cinnamonbear14b @Streakyblue1951 @JuliaHB1 Oh yeah, like no one else who had cv19 has got a 4yr old, it's only Cummings🙄 Or that his wife's brother AND sister live IN London, not 260 miles away🤦🏻‍♂️ Or that govt guidelines, HE HELP MAKE, state stay at home if you have symptoms, EVEN WITH KIDS. You know, like rest of us🙄🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today just goes to show why I cursed Corbyn for being goaded into GE by Johnson back in Nov when he had no chance of winning.

<|startoftext|>I think it's 90% v 10% on here  90% being Cummings is bang to rights &amp; out of order, 10% are his minions (ministers)  #sackcummimgs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sday69 @BootstrapCook Get what ready?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DailyBriefing  Today's gem  .@grantshapps - 'Use common sense'  Like driving 5hrs to other end of country (with your wife &amp; 4yr old, whilst infected with coronavirus)  #sackcummimgs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All those who voted Tory at last GE, esp marginal northern seats, &amp; who've been complaining about ending lockdown soon, have been properly shafted by Cumming's 'Do as I say, not as I Do'. Hopefully you now see what duplicitous a-holes this lot really are  #sackcummimgs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I knew I'd seen Cummings somewhere before (back left)  #sackcummimgs  #COVIDー19 #MarsAttacks  https://t.co/KeUdQfBB8F<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would it be fair to say, especially in Light of the Cummings news &amp; subsequent faux defence mounted by most Tory ministers, that we literally cannot trust a word of what they do or say?   #sackcummimgs #COVIDー19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@topfotogmw @GaryLineker By driving 264miles, when his Bro-i-Law was 5mins down the road? Yeah ok🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This thread nails it 👍🏼👏🏼 #sackcummimgs #Covid19UK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone who lost a loved one in hospital, care home or even at home, and couldn't be there with them due to lockdown rules, must be pretty pissed off &amp; angry at how much contempt Cummings has shown by not adhering to them himself  #COVIDー19 #sackcummimgs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RishiSunak Says Rishi, who appointed the advisors who Cummings told him to - or he wouldn't be made chancellor  https://t.co/9N6Xcpaz2E<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lucyallan @RishiSunak Says Lucy who posted a fake doctored clip of opposition leader during the national crisis, got told off for it by her bosses and had to take it down🙄🤦🏻‍♂️ No self awareness, No shame, Hypocrisy at its best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeniseHonor @SkyNews Yes but I think some of them were asking the wrong thing. 'its not a good look' is not really a good question. I'd be asking 'so wouldn't it have been easier for you to drop your son off at your wife's brothers house in London, rather than drive 260miles with corona?'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>10 Downing Street saying Durham Police didn't talk to the Cummings family, when police statement clearly says they did. Hmmmm🤔  #sackcummimgs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cummings on @SkyNews shouting at reporters 'social distancing' as he comes out his house is the ultimate ironic piss take  #skynews #Covid19UK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rozkez67  https://t.co/GtYX6FWiYi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't be just me who's thinking Tory party, espesh top brass, are sh*tt*n themselves today?🤔 No wonder they're all out in force on twitter defending crap out of Cummings, all using child angle for sympathy. None of this for Ferguson or Calderwood?  #SaturdayThoughts #StayHome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Say it isn't so 😱 To think he had drive 260 odd miles when he could have done it in 10 #cummingsgate #sackcummimgs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today I've learnt that in Tory party circles, Cummings is more important to save than 60,000 lives.  #StayHome #COVIDー19 #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DailyBriefing questions 1. What were #lockdown rules time Cummings went to Durham? Not, did he need childcare, what were rules? 2. Did rules say can travel 264 miles with CV19 to drop son at parents? 3. Can public do same now?if not, why not? 4. Was his mum's BD that week?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Beany_1 I lost my mum to the dreaded C, I absolutely feel your rage. Can't imagine what It'd be like if she was here and I couldn't see her.  It's a f***ing disgrace what he's done, and what they're now doing covering it up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joannamont You may be right but the pressure is building. All the Tory heavys are out to defend him this morning, they know it's bad.  Today's briefing 'should' be interesting, whoever does it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lunaperla @ActionFbpe @DPJHodges What do you reckon @sday69 🤔😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cummings is so popular that in whole of London, he or wife didn't know ANYONE who could look after his son if he (or she) was as ill as claimed. Or his sister couldn't come &amp; collect him 🤔 Fact that was his mum's birthday that week in Durham was pure coincidence #cummingsgate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Basically Cummings 4yr old is more important than whole of the UK's 4yr olds.   #cummingsgate #SackCummingsNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#cummingsgate Can't remember being this vexed about political things since last Oct🤬 Just last night before news broke, was passionately discussing with family need for safety first &amp; protecting ourselves. Was 4 on 1. And then this news broke🤦🏻‍♂️🤬 Fuming is putting it mildly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaelgove It is if you're BREAKING the rules that you've helped set up. But you'd already know that 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BethRigby So because he was concerned, he can drive 260 odd miles?? Like fook he can! Lying tw*t who got caught<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@petersturdgess @bbclaurak 👍🏼👏🏼😉  https://t.co/czIQZugoWz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now we're gonna see all the best bullsh*t from Bozo, Dummings &amp; LK. Birds of a feather etc  #cummingsgate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pitstop221 @YTywysog @PippaBird @bbclaurak I must have missed the part where it said you can drive 264 miles WITH corona virus, when Johnson explicitly said you CAN'T GO ANYWHERE if you have cv19. Do keep up🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was Cummings in Durham around the 10th May? And if he was, Why? Why is he able to break lockdown rules?  We need answers and sackings. This bullshit will not wash anymore  #SaturdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Streakyblue1951 @JuliaHB1 That's right, driving 250 miles whilst ill with corona virus is covered 🙄🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️ Why couldn't he stay in London and isolate for 7 days, others 14, as per the rules which THEY SET OUT, like everyone else with cv19 did?🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely Fumin!!🤬 Not seen family for 2 months, we're all told to stay home &amp; yet, Govt ministers &amp; PM's advisors can go WhereTF they like!?! Show me in Lockdown rules where it says you can travel 250miles!! All he got was a talking to by Police🤦🏻‍♂️ #COVIDー19 #CummingsOutNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbclaurak @PippaCrerar Source my ar*e. More like the slime ball's been on the phone to his mate Laura as he knows he's effed up big time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone asks, just tell Dominic Cummings said it's ok<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guys, #BorisJohnson's main advisor REALLY IS against the establishment! Whilst he's advising ministers to tell everyone to stay home, he pulled a 'V'  &amp; went to see his parents.  Thanks Dom, you slimey shit, you've just opened the gates for everyone.  #StayHome #lockdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So .@BorisJohnson if Cummings can travel 250 miles to be with his family, guessing rest of us can too?  If good enough for him, advisor for PM of UK, it's good enough for us. Not seen mine in 2 months. OR  SACK HIS ASS &amp; set an example. #COVIDー19 #cummingsresign<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This Tw*t needs to be sacked. No ifs, No buts. If Prof. Ferguson and Dr Calderwood had to, so does Cummings. No difference.  #cummingsresign #COVIDIOTS   https://t.co/pcSVVfurMl<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pritipatel @MattHancock Extraordinary circumstances?? They were exactly the same yesterday!! All that's changed is UK clearly saw you, Bozo &amp; Canhock trying it on &amp; getting absolutely smashed by Starmer &amp; media for being bunch of heartless bar stewards that you really are #clapforcarers #Covid19UK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone in workplace who knows couple are an item, one being your boss - direct or indirect - &amp; you need to make decision that affects his/her partner, you're DEFINITELY going to 'do the right thing' Bc if you don't, curtains for you at some point &amp; none of it would be on record<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JustSayNope @Chrisballingall @ChrissieGrech This tweet plus 2 above summarise it perfectly. It's like we're on Con Air!  John Malkovich is Johnson, some of fellow inmates are ministers, and rest of people on plane represent us.

<|startoftext|>@janeharbison12 @LBC @mrjamesob They have no humanity 🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait, what?🧐 Don't tell me Bozo Johnson is telling porkies again - IN PARLIAMENT?? #PMQs #Covid19UK #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great British common sense he said🙄 #heatwave #Covid19UK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage Desperate people resort to desperate measures. And I'm not talking about the refugees.  Also, 'Invasion', in a dinghy???😂🤦🏻‍♂️😂 What about the Invasion from Turkey - that never happened??  You are one sad, sad desperate man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiamFox And??? No one gives a shit about 'Per million' It's about HOW MANY ACTUALLY DIED!!🤬 Is that how you'd comfort someone who's lost a loved one? 'Yeah but at least we're not top in per million'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PMQs  The pause that Sir Keir adds at the end of his questions is killer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@janeharbison12 @LBC @mrjamesob That H word doesn't belong in that sentence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ForkesGuido He's going on a 2 week bender<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PMQs . W. T. 🤬 Right in the middle of a NATIONAL CRISIS &amp; 60,000 DEATHS of UK citizens, of which many were wholly avoidable but for our shambolic Govt, Leader of house announces they are closing down parliament, for a 2 WEEK HOLIDAY.   SERIOUSLY??!?😲🤬  #Covid19UK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PMQs Fave comment of the day by @Keir_Starmer 👍🏼👏🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TobyonTV That's his 'oh fc*k' face<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Buckland in Cummings naughty boy office today me thinks.  #Covid19UK #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PMQs Johnson talk about raising £900m for NHS from the overseas staff surcharge.  Never mind that, he owes NHS £350m a week!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PMQs If there's one job Rees-Mogg was made for, it's Tory leader of the house🙄 Bore you into submission<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PMQs Basically Bozo Johnson just said to foreign NHS staff 'thanks for your help, now cough up' 🤦🏻‍♂️ As said many times before, literally not an ounce of shame in these disgusting human beings called Tory Govt.  #Covid19UK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PMQs  Great question by the @theSNP Allan Dorrans. How can Tory Scottish Sec do a near 700mile trip from Scotland to be in HoC, when Scotland is in lockdown? Will PM condemn or condone? Johnson did neither, as expected.  One rule for them, one for rest.  #Covid19UK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@A13XDB Exactly. The shift has started<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PMQs  I despair at questions Tories are asking PM. Virtually nothing to do with what's going on. It's almost as if they're trying to DELIBERATELY ignore reality. I wonder why 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/ypilmL7ZcQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PMQs  And that's a wrap! Now Johnson can disappear back into his 10 downing Street pub lock-in again. For 2 weeks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PMQs  @Keir_Starmer is absolutely obliterating Johnson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PMQs  Seriously, how is this Muppet PM?? He doesn't have a flippin clue. Just going off at tangents, whereas @Keir_Starmer on point. As usual<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PMQs  Shots fired by Speaker!!  https://t.co/luuJEl83dV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PMQs  Did Johnson just put the blame on Doctors for sending elderly to care homes?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jonathan_MBanks  https://t.co/33rvakLc1h<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now why would Tories send out the Justice Secretary to admit they chose to send so many elderly to their deaths in care homes?🤔 Is it because they know the storms incoming?  #coronavirus #Covid19UK #carehomes #WednesdayThoughts   https://t.co/EAgMteoY5a<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who's surprised🙄 Exactly no one who knows who's involved in its making. Also probably @Google &amp; @Apple who know how to do this kind of stuff.  #DailyBriefing #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Otto_English @andywigmore I predict this picture will become a very popular meme. A bad one for Banks, good for rest of us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What we all feared but now confirmed. They let our elderly die needlessly, and without mercy. #BorisJohnson &amp; Tory party leadership up for manslaughter?  #DailyBriefing #COVID19 #carehomes    https://t.co/SMW1GUiCrg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#pickforbritain Chuffin 'ell 🤬 35,000 Brits have died, more likely 62,000, what's on the agenda? Fruit &amp; veg picking 🤦🏻‍♂️  #DailyBriefing #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#pickforbritain I nominate @Nigel_Farage @pritipatel @michaelgove &amp; of course @BorisJohnson to lead the way &amp; show us how pick the fruit &amp; veg.  After all, this I what they wanted.  Less EU citizens, more jobs for Leave...I mean English.  #DailyBriefing #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All those who wanted #leave should do their patriotic duty and head to their nearest farmers field forthwith. Your country needs you!  Everyone else - sit back and watch the chaos  #DailyBriefing #COVID19<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Of which 34,000 govt say are #COVID19 in hospitals. So begs most obvious of questions, where's other 28,000 from? Care home &amp; home deaths? From Covid? 🤔🤔 #coronavirus #staysafe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonathan_MBanks Importantly, wouldn't be here if rules @pritipatel wants to introduce now were in place when her parents came to UK. Rank Hypocrisy of highest order. Surprised?

<|startoftext|>.@piersmorgan is the nearest thing to Jeremy Paxman. Why? No one liked to be 'interviewed' (spit roasted?) by Paxo, especially Govt ministers. Seems Morgan's doing same. They're scared of him   #COVID19 #coronavirus #StayHome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carolecadwalla @michaelgove's lying. Again. And again. And again. He's become quite an expert.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bozo is following the science, obviously. From last month 🙄🤦🏻‍♂️ #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe .@Keir_Starmer looked ahead and realised that a load of blue donkeys are gonna need somewhere to graze in the future. Good thinking 😉 #donkeygate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nessacc44 Maybe he's not the ex after all, and just a Tory doing his duty, as is she🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FFS At what point is 50,000 plus deaths in UK going to be a big deal, especially care home deaths? What else / more needs to happen??  Newspapers &amp; media need to call it out for what it is -  Murder, in Plain sight  #COVID19 #StayHome #coronavirus @mrjamesob @piersmorgan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously, what is it with all these Piers hogging the headlines all of a sudden??🤔😂  #sundayvibes #staysafe #StayHome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When eternally dumb-struck people like @NadineDorries make comments about obesity &amp; #coronavirus, maybe she should look at her boss in no.10 first. Prime candidate, as well as minister. #JustSayin  #StayHome #StayAlert<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TiceRichard @BorisJohnson Common sense you say🤔 Like 'Take control of our borders' and when had first opportunity, literally left them WIDE OPEN from March, whilst a worldwide pandemic was spreading! Or 22 flights a day landing at Heathrow from biggest hot spot in world - New York.  Geniuses at work 🤦🏻‍♂️🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonathan_MBanks Let's just say you didn't miss much, apart from another 'How to BBQ with @piersmorgan' session<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Clueless fcukwits, the lot of em 🤦🏻‍♂️ #COVIDIOTS #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today, I can imagine what it must feel like being an EU negotiator dealing with Johnson's Govt, If stay alert shite is anything to go on. I've seen clearer piles of cow dung  #MondayMorning #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not surprised whatsoever. Corruption is one their middle names. #coronavirus #COVID19  #ToryShambles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What method do you think Johnson &amp; Cummings use to choose who to send to explain #StayAlert bollocks to the Media? A. Lotto style balls (number = name) B. Names on paper in a hat C. Just straws I'm going with A. They do it so often has to be this #COVID19 #BorisHasFailed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCr4today Or In layman's terms, he's passing the buck to us so when it spikes again, easy target to pick on and blame. Calling these Tories Pathetic is too polite.  Here are some alt choices : 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬, 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬, 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬, 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SueHowes14 @drmpwalsh I did same, with a confused face too. It's like sense in reverse. They THINK they're speaking it but in reality, Govt are speaking complete gibberish. No self awareness whatsoever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbclaurak @BBCr4today There's always that 'aaawww' in the tone of your tweets🤨 You'll say it's bc you're  being objective, but to rest it's crystal clear. You're a 'try-hard' as in, you're trying hard but no matter how hard you try, still can't hide your love &amp; affection for all things Johnson &amp; Co<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonathan_MBanks  https://t.co/3g8feFZTp8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why did #BorisJohnson make speech on Sun evening &amp; not Mon morning in Parliament? My guess? Get all abuse out of way, analyse &amp; have bunch of answers ready. Imagine prep sheets Cummings will have ready for ministers for Mon. Watch em all parrot it verse &amp; chapter🙄 #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reading on twitteratti Johnson recorded his Sun evening message, not on Sun morning, but before/on Friday. Is this true? Never mind that couldn't be bothered to do live speech, apparently pre-recorded it 3 days earlier so could have a long weekend!🤦🏻‍♂️🤬 #prerecorded #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>'Oi, get tight on him!' #COVID19 #BorisHasFailed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GuzKhanOfficial Gutted 😥 May the almighty give him the strength to carry on 🤲🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>32,000 deaths😥 (and still counting) from #COVID19 in just 8 weeks or so, 2nd highest in the world, but according to a-hole #BorisJohnson, apparently this is AVOIDING a 'catastrophe' 🤯🤦🏻‍♂️🤬🤬  Any other era, heads would roll.  #BorisHasFailed #BorisOut #StayHome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JosieLong It is. I'd say unfortunately but it's not unfortunate. The know exactly what &amp; who they're targeting.  Cynical doesn't cover it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never forget #BorisJohnson was PM when UK was hit with a pandemic and he chose to ignore it for 3-4 weeks, shaking hands in the process. Completely getting it wrong. 32,000 deaths and counting (prob significantly more), 2nd Highest in world, testify to that  #COVIDIOTS  #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good thread explaining the R 😉👍🏼 #COVID19 #StayHome #BorisHasFailed<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Maybe it's just me but I get the feeling this Govt fall in the very near future, if not just the PM.  We're approaching peak chaos  #COVID19<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#COVID19  https://t.co/ChW6L2IOZ5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THIS is why Johnson wants to break the lockdown.  #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Genuinely confused. Stay at home as much as possible, but if you go out, stay alert. To what? 2 metres? Invisible virus?? And why would people be going out anyway, if majority of shops are closed? Unless that's about to change  #COVIDIOTS #COVID19 #StayHome #StayAlert<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Clear as mud from Jenrick  #COVIDIOTS #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisBCFC1 @Keir_Starmer I agree. He won't argue for sake of it. sKS is methodical in his approach. He's been laying barrister landlines (heard that from a barrister!) these last 2-3 weeks, esp when he faced Johnson last wed. Govt is digging massive holes. And they're only gonna get deeper<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Otto_English 'Are you taking the piss?'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisBCFC1 @Keir_Starmer He will, but this message is so ambiguous and confused (again), it's something sKS must clearly strike for.  Johnson is desperate. He's staking people's lives for the sake of his billionaire patrons.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#sundayvibes Breaking lockdown down last few days down to 2 people/groups. 1. #BorisJohnson 2. Media BJ bc leaked week ago would look to ease, raising hopes.

<|startoftext|>Watching Conga clip from Warrington, 4 emojis crossed my mind 🙄🤦🏻‍♂️🤬 😥 1st three are obvious. 4th is for all who have lost loved ones, yet could only take 5 people to funeral due to lockdown &amp; social distancing.

<|startoftext|>@Cat_n_Bagpipes @RichardAske Exactly this. On wed, I said BJ looked like a clown and not a showman (what Kunessburg called him), in front of Starmer at PMQs.

<|startoftext|>@bbclaurak Showman?? 🤦🏻‍♂️😂 More like 🤡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ThursdayThoughts  Don't think #BorisJohnson's easing of lockdown is him caring about people's frustrations. Wrong. All about 💷💷💷 1. His Patrons are losing money.  2. Longer UK stays closed, more Tories will have to cough up to help.  Open things up = not so much #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ThursdayThoughts 30,000 deaths, probably much worse, and STILL RISING,  WORST in EU / Europe, 2nd WORST in world. #BorisJohnson's solution  - We'll start to ease lockdown from next week!  W🤯 T🤯 F🤯 🤦🏻‍♂️🤬   #coronavirus #COVID19 #UKlockdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very important to remember this next time Bozo says what he's done has been a success #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tnewtondunn Tom, Johnson looked like a Muppet in front of an experienced QC. had no gallery to play to and he was waffle champ again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So accurate 😂😂 #PMQs #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>👍🏼😂 #PMQs #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PMQs YESSSS!! This is what we've waiting for. This is what we've been missing. An effective opposition leader who can flip it realtime, in the moment. Johnson looked so lost. Great start Sir @Keir_Starmer 👏🏼👍🏼  #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KayBurley @MattHancock Really? 🧐 Therefore, according to Hancock, cabinet colleague  .@RobertJenrick should also be prosecuted for breaking lockdown &amp; traveling 40 odd miles to his parents last month.  I mean, what's the difference??🤷🏻‍♂️🤔  #Hypocrite #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really couldn't give 2 💩 about Neil Ferguson's escapades. Yes was wrong to break lockdown, but on scale of things, is it really that important when 32k have died?🤔 Also why's it coming out now, few weeks after event?🤔 Tory dead cat diversion #COVID19 #WednesdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>32,000 deaths, maybe significantly more due to misrepresentation or time lag, yet certain people who advocated the course of action that lead to this, show zero remorse and are still in a job. Welcome to Tory Britain 2020  #wednesdaymorning #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unbelievable🤯🤦🏻‍♂️ Read top of Peston's thread, then read this tweet. Mind boggles how they think this can work. Clearly just a data harvesting app.  If they really gave a shit, they'd just use Google/apple one. I won't be downloading  #COVID19 #lockdown #StayAtHome #staysafe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If .@MattHancock told me to watch my tone, I'd tell him needs to listen to himself first🙄🤦🏻‍♂️ Patronising, rude &amp; bang out of order🤬 Sooner rather than later, he'll be made the scapegoat for Johnson's mistakes. Then we'll see HIS tone  #COVID19 #WednesdayThoughts  @DrRosena 👍🏼👏🏼<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bbclaurak Here we go again 🙄 'Ooo look, it's Dead cat on the table' 🤦🏻‍♂️ You and Daily Torygraph will literally do anything to divert attention away from the disaster that has unfolded under Johnson's Premiership.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never forget. .@BorisJohnson was Prime Minister of UK when 30,000 (and still counting) people DIED of a virus he had TWO MONTH'S ADVANCE WARNING of, and did nothing. This IS &amp; WILL BE, his legacy.  #COVID19 #lockdown #staysafe<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GuitarMoog What I'm curious about is Who's books are they, his or hers?🤯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wordamentalist Most of it. Had symptoms but were greatly exaggerated. Weird how apparently was 'close to death' - but not on a ventilator, then discharged 4 days later. walking out 🤔 All for 'aaaww bless' effect for zombies who follow him. A convenient distraction, topped up by baby's birth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@terrychristian Terry, seriously, you expect them to answer that?? 🤦🏻‍♂️🤨 You lost them after 5th word!!😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson Another day, another slogan 🙄  We don't need to beat it together. It's YOUR job to sort it out but clearly thousands of deaths prove you're not up to it.  Complete clown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ange_Sandgrown Agree with your title - Tory gov kills - want them gone too, but time you stopped this nonsense. RLB lost. Wasn't even close. Only way to defeat Tories is get on side or move along. Point you lot don't get is majority of country didn't want JC. They had 2 chances &amp; said no. Twice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ange_Sandgrown Rigged??🤨 So the party &amp; NEC, which was controlled by Corbyn's people, rigged election against his own choice Right 🙄🤦🏻‍♂️ Stop crying &amp; get over yourself. You lost. Again. What's that now? 2 GE MEP elections Local elections - twice  And now leadership. Quite a losing streak😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Project fear they said🙄🤦🏻‍♂️ The DM has a lot to answer for, with its EU xenophobia. But Where's .@Nigel_Farage &amp; his Brexit party followers?? This is what they wanted.

<|startoftext|>@splootman @ColinCorbynista Never mind Govt, what has he achieved in opposition, front or back benches? Can't think of one, apart from making lots of noise &amp; voting against his party hundreds of times when Lab in Govt🤦🏻‍♂️ Always said, might be good man who means well but not good leader. Protester mentality<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ColinCorbynista Still in a bubble??🙄🤦🏻‍♂️ You had your chance over 4.5.yrs You lost, not once but TWICE! 2nd time worst result by Lab leader since 1935.

<|startoftext|>Very valid point. #COVID19 #staysafe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#FridayThoughts Wouldn't it be good if our Govt could just tell the truth, instead of PR &amp; marketing gimmicks?  Honesty, with humility, is the best policy.  #COVID19 #Covid19UK #StayHome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>However, that UK Govt is sticking to red line, 31st Dec, tells us there is an ulterior motive🤔 And sadly that's always been case with #Brexit. They have covered it in, lies deceit &amp; deception from day one. Still are. And now they're doing same with #coronavirus   #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Extending transition is LOGICAL thing to do, for us, as well as EU. Extend 6 months, even 12, give everyone chance to get on top of crisis, esp us.  When told it's bc of cv19 &amp; complications to society/economy, no one, not even Brexiters, can argue against. It's crystal clear<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The country is at a standstill, to all intents &amp; purposes. Businesses don't know if they'll exist next month, never mind next year. What Govt SHOULD be doing is channeling all efforts &amp; resources into making sure they do &amp; getting economy on an even keel, not talking trade deals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But to think, right now, in the middle of pandemic, do we need to be discussing trade deals, with only few months left to put in place deals which have to replace 40 odd years worth?? I don't think so.  #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#FridayThoughts  So glaringly obvious for those with sense but needs to be said to those who can't see it. #Brexit has happened, we're leaving EU.  Not happy about that but it's already started.  We have to 'accept' that fact. #COVID19   Thread<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Message for .@bbclaurak   #COVID19<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Tara61711 With 27k (or is that 47) deaths on his watch, great is the last word I'd think of. More like shite<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never forget. Whatever Johnson is doing is direct result of Corbyn saying yes to GE. NO GE. NO Tory win. NO 80 Majority. With 27k deaths, Govt would be on brink, allowing Govt Nat Unity to see us through #coronavirus crisis. Now? Do what they want🤷🏻‍♂️ Cheers Jeremy 🙄 #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Putting aside that China does have issues (human rights etc) - which we already know - this is a pretty accurate account of last 4-5 months. What's scary is Johnson has behaved in a similar way as USA #COVID19 #Covid19UK #StayHome  @piersmorgan @cirian75 @mrjamesob @nicktolhurst<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaketapper C'mon Jake, 99.99% of that's true! What China does (human rights etc) we already know. They've always been like that. But now we also confirmed that Trump &amp; Co are complete BS hypocrites.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rozkez67 Bigger than ol' Nige? 🤔😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haggis_UK Minister said if you don't hit your target, it's fine, as long as you're moving in the right direction.

Biggest gripe is when in Asda I'm dodging people trying to SD, yet many/most not &amp; just looking at their list!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jacquep To be expected🙄🤷🏻‍♂️ SKS had Govt on back foot last 2 weeks. Quicker they accept JC experiment is d &amp; d, and now time to go Back to Future, Lab will get back in power.

<|startoftext|>Anyone who thinks having another baby will change Johnson &amp; make him a better person, really need their head checking🤦🏻‍♂️ What happened when he had the previous 5, 6 or 7???  Nothing from where I'm sitting.  Just another Trump.  #COVID19 #BorisBaby<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Peston @BorisJohnson Are you kidding us?? 🤦🏻‍♂️ The guy has zero humility or compassion. He'll probably deny this child as well in the future when he splits from Carrie. Because it will happen. Leopard &amp; spots.  #BorisJohnson #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattHancock @DailyMailUK 🙄🙄 UK Health minister admits he can't source PPE - WITH UNLIMITED RESOURCES AT HIS DISPOSAL- praises newspaper who get a days worth. Embarrassing🤦🏻‍♂️ #COVID19 #WednesdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's called humility, which our govt has ZERO of. #COVID19<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dontbrexitfixit Great point Mr P 👍🏼 Always looking for a cheap option are these Tory govt muggers.  It's a Preemptive low ball. Offer them before they challenge. Imagine if 100+ NHS workers family's clubbed together &amp; took them to court for downgrading #COVID19 on 19th March?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SSummerskill @afneil Evidence is there for all to see. It's not mine. FT reporting it everyday. 41k deaths last week, obvs more now. Govt hiding true figures. Easy to see why. Their slow response &amp; Herd ideology has caused many of these deaths, unnecessarily Open your eyes &amp; see the truth.  #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TuesdayThoughts  I really think the Govt needs to get better accountants in. When it comes to PPE,  1 = 100 Yet when it comes to #COVID19 deaths,  27,000 care home / home deaths = 🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>According to #Panorama Govt classes 1 pack of paper towels (100 in a pack) as 100 items of PPE.  Therefore by  .@MattHancock definition, would 1 toilet roll be 240 pieces of PPE? 🤔🙄🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️  #TuesdayThoughts #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TuesdayThoughts  All I see is people in UK Govt constantly hiding the facts &amp; truth. Seems it's not about 'protect the public', more protect themselves from what's to come.  #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TuesdayThoughts   'Following the Science' is the new 'Get Brexit Done', which was the new  'Strong &amp; Stable'  Slogans, no Solutions.  #COVID19 #BORISISBACK #StayHome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haggis_UK When govt minister says 'we're following the science'  what are they actually saying? With over 45k deaths - 2nd in world - are they say our scientists are shit and  Germany, SKorea, NZ and other countries coping have better ones?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattHancock By top form, you mean he's back and going to accept responsibility for all the failings?🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SSummerskill @afneil Here we go🙄 When someone can't defend their argument, they go on a 'You're fake news' attack🤦🏻‍♂️😂 My figures are not made up. Look for yourself. 21k is govt announced. Others are what office of national statistics (ONS) are saying. Belgium figs provided by Belgium.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SSummerskill @afneil Jeeezus🤦🏻‍♂️ Who gives a shit about 'Per 100k'?? It's the total that matters! 40k+ people have already died ON JOHNSON'S WATCH. Sad but true Fact. Twist that how you want but they're all dead. And he was in charge.  Accept it &amp; move on. Don't provide smoke &amp; mirrors<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is so true 👍🏼👏🏼 #mondaythoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlbasArachnid Or @vimto ? 😉  https://t.co/DXSCGWRAAk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 Every death in UK to #COVID19 post 5th March can be indirectly attributed to the PM &amp; his advisors. They didn't act soon enough. Fact. And now hide behind 'we followed the science'  bs. Begs the Question. Do Germany &amp; other countries who contained have better scientists?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#mondaythoughts   With the return of the naughty boy Johnson (not Messiah 😉), seen a big rise in tweets from his sycophants last night &amp; this morning. Not co-ordinated at all 🙄  #COVID19  #lockdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenOld Exactly. No content, no direction, just gaslighting. Looking to now call in others for talks when he should have weeks ago. although tbf, Labour now have a leader capable of  listening &amp; dissecting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@montie @Ofcom TM sits there defending his Tory pals with his blue tinted glass on, but clearly hasn't been keeping up to date with ACTUAL FACTS. HIGHEST DEATH RATE in Europe can be DIRECTLY attributed to lack of action by PM in late Feb / early March. All on you &amp; yours Monte #HerdImmunity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#mondaythoughts  Johnson may as well not bothered. Pointless. Almost as if done to just say 'hi-ya'  #COVIDIOT #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No.10 press releases over last few weeks sound awfully like those that come out of Pyongyang. Spookily, both leaders have been ill at same time🤔  #Covid_19 #mondaythoughts #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afneil Highest death rate in Europe is end of phase 1.  Imagine what that means for phase 2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlloaMan @campbellclaret @BorisJohnson He came back last night, but yeah 🙄🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toadmeister Show us how to do it then? Go on, be a devil, break the rules😉 Isn't that what you're MO is all about?  Or are you  https://t.co/xSVvLFcwaL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@montie @Ofcom Apart from HIGHEST death rate in Europe (real figure), 2nd in world, airports still open with no checks or quarantine, not enough PPE for NHS staff who have lost their lives as a result, exactly what is there to NOT attack?? We'll wait...  #HerdImmunity #Covid_19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait, what?🤔😱 21k deaths, real figure more like 40k, 2nd highest in world, is making progress?? Towards what, No.1?!? 🤦🏻‍♂️🤬  #Covid_19 #lockdown #StayHome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@valpan @nazirafzal @MailOnline @privateye Have no issue exposing criminal acts of depraved individuals, whatever race or background.  But rw media have own agendas to promote so that's what saddens me re it being in DM. Why now? right in middle of pandemic, where diff races / religions are at frontline, they serialise🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afneil 🙄🤦🏻‍♂️ Damn site better than being Mr Andrew 'Yes sir, no sir, three bags full sir' Neil to Tory ERG paymasters.  Or should that be 550k bags😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@valpan @nazirafzal @MailOnline The report is spot on, no doubt 👍🏼 My only question is where it's being shown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afneil Simple question. Would the have PM sit in on that meeting? If that's a yes, then ok. If No, then his advisors shouldn't either.  The scientists should be able to report their findings independently without fear of the man who fires people over wrong size staples sat behind them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is some scary shit 😱 Nice one Carole 👍🏼👏🏼 Maybe @Keir_Starmer or @DavidLammy should be taking a look into this   #Covid_19 #SundayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@valpan @nazirafzal @MailOnline Agree with last sentence but reality is in DM, it's not 1 to 10, it's 10 to 1. Right are empowered by these serialisations. DM, DE, DT &amp; Sc*m create negativity &amp; division within society towards ethnic minorities &amp; EU citizens, esp last 5-6yrs. No wonder hate crimes on rise<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@montie Ludicrous questioning???🙄🤦🏻‍♂️ Don't know if heard but 20k people have died. Many may not have if clown of PM had acted sooner. When time comes, and it will, you'll all be in the firing line. Also, would PM attend a SAGE meeting? No, then neither should his Spads.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nazirafzal @MailOnline Nice one, although serialising it in the Daily Fail is not a good look.  Their readers will ignore who you are and just see the words ' Pakistani '  'Sex grooming' and make a loads of racist assumptions.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ComradeGeordie Have you been in cryo freeze for last few years??🤦🏻‍♂️ JC bullied by BJ into GE he couldn't win, oppo had majority of 40. All he had to do was sit &amp; let BJ bury himself. Imagine Tories during this crisis WITH NO MAJORITY.  Now BJ has 80 majority. Enable Tories? Look in mirror🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cirian75 Great scene 👍🏼 And probably about right, apart from Raab, he couldn't hurt a dead fly or get info out of open newspaper😂 Also, I think Guy Pearce would be offended with comparison 😄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hjetechnical @Haggis_UK They are hospital grade &amp; approved. I bought some. Thing is, why need to buy from Turkey? 🤔 Govt not being honest. They're cheaper from abroad. Not about short supply. Buying from UK = more expensive.That's it. But Govt won't ever admit that as goes against Brexitology<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>UK orders PPE from Turkey, when there are companies in UK who can supply ALMOST IMMEDIATELY🤨 But no one's asked most obvious question. Why Turkey?🤔 My guess? Cheaper. A kick in gangoolies for Brexidiot 'Buy British' ideology🤦🏻‍♂️ Imagine Govt admitting that😂 #COVID19 #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grahambsi Short answer - No. It's like the 3 Stooges in charge!  Personally I was more of a Marx Bros fan. And right now, I think they'd do a better job than the current idiots<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrewLawDesign What lightbulb?? It's a complete lie. There are no lightbulbs and whoever said there are, they are being mendacious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GreenBin69 @Haggis_UK I didn't need to look hard. 2 suppliers I already know of are supplying gloves &amp; masks. I can literally go on and order as many as I want, and delivered in few days. I'm sure with minimal research I'd find the other bits for PPE too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They have a special list. It's called - Tory Party Donors  #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haggis_UK FFS🙄 I could literally find all UK PPE suppliers in less than an hour using Uncle Google!!🤦🏻‍♂️🤬 Why is the govt not able to do the same, rather than waiting for them to contact govt?🧐 Can only assume they don't want to find them...🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>

Why don't you get petition going to get all Brexidiots to volunteer first instead? bc of them they're having to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toryboypierce Not well probably. But Govt scheme allows it. Take up with Rishi. Don't go down moral route or you'd better start asking your chicken PM why he didn't act sooner. 16k DEAD, thousands unaccounted.

<|startoftext|>Weird🤨 450 Romanians being flown in from EU to pick fruit &amp; veg crop due to shortage of workers.  You know, ones who  .@Nigel_Farage, Brexit party &amp; Leave wanted rid of.

<|startoftext|>@RichardBurgon Sorry that's BS. Putting ALL down to sabotage is gaslighting. JC didn't win in 2017 bc couldn't convince enough Tory, ex-Lab &amp; undecideds to vote for him. Simple. You know it but will never admit. Now conveniently report appears AFTER sKS is elected🤔  And they're saboteurs!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damning🤬 Our NHS nurses, doctors and staff deserve better. Clapping jestures are all well and good, but when you have leaders like this who conspire against them, it all looks fake  #coronavirus #Covid_19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>👏🏼👍🏼 Tory master plan revealed #Covid_19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#LabourLeaks So let me get this straight. The saboteurs are trying to sabotage the sabotage of the saboteurs? 🤨🧐🤔  #LabourReport<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#LabourLeaks  From what I've seen, heads will &amp; should roll. Sure @Keir_Starmer will take decisive action, at the appropriate time once he has full info. However what's telling is detail &amp; effort gone into this.  Why leaked now, week after his win?  Why not before?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zarahsultana Easy to point to these 7. Maybe if Lab convinced more people in other seats, these 7 would have been irrelevant? And even if he'd won these 7 &amp; got into coalition govt, major concessions would have had to be made with others. Very simplistic view to fit a narrative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StuartDillon1 @Keir_Starmer @AngelaRayner @UKLabour I suspect he will be consulting with top tier as you &amp; I type to come up with an appropriate response.  Odd though that this comes out now, and not after JC lost election.  Sabotage of the sabotage by  saboteurs?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@reggie_denny @cenninbach @PeterStefanovi2 Surely they can afford to pay for it out of their salary? Many are very wealthy, others less so but even so.

<|startoftext|>@R00pert Yes, you're right, it's hospital ones.  Yes, but if that's the case, it's much worse in each country as well. And that's the scary part. In UK, our response was far too late, like 3-4 wks too late.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@R00pert 🤦🏻‍♂️ It's an absolute piss take  I actually think it's much worse than they're telling us (UK deaths)  Probably add 5k at least.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>UK - Nearly 1000 people die.  Media - Boris is sat up in bed 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤬🤬🤬  #COVID19 #ThursdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please explain why we've only tested 280k people, 2 weeks after lockdown, out of population of 68m?? Any wonder we've lost 7k, &amp; that's only hospital deaths! doesn't include at home or care homes. Who is responsible @MattHancock??  #ThursdayThoughts #COVID19  @carolecadwalla<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cirian75 So glad Burgon is out. Whenever he spoke, I was like  https://t.co/B8rMfM1bWK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sillyshib A key appointment. Thank God Milne is out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Normally, If someone goes to hospital and stays in, poss even needing oxygen to help breath, they DON'T work🧐 So why's PM working, when he clearly needs to be there? 🤔 And if he can work, give up the bed? Something not adding up  #BorisJohnson #COVID19 #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watch the clip. This man (Raab) could potentially be running the country. Scary  #COVID19 #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like tweet I put before re PM having cv19, they (Tory think tank) never thought it'd get them.  Regardless, never a good feeling at a loss of a loved one. Let's hope it helps focus minds in the right way  #COVID19 #mondaythoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#mondaythoughts Anyone taken to hosp for #coronavirus is worrying, but when it's PM, even more so.  Wish BJ speedy recovery🤲🏼🙏🏼 Ironic he's fallen foul of cv19.

<|startoftext|>@AyoCaesar @jeremycorbyn 🙄🤦🏻‍♂️ Wouldn't step aside to let  GNU take over last Oct when was right move.

<|startoftext|>@CreationJacks @stamford_dan @jeremycorbyn I mean it's not like he lost 2 Gen Elections, one worst result since 1935, all Locals &amp; MEPs. The objective was to win. He didn't. Ever, apart from own seat. Not hating, Just stating🤷🏻‍♂️ 5yrs of Labour going nowhere, apart from the wilderness &amp; enabling Toryism, ends tomorrow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iblogtoglasgow simple. No matter who's in charge, always fund essential/core services properly. And in a time of crisis, you see that. We on other hand, have sent 10yrs in unnecessary Tory austerity bubble, which has now burst. More will die bc of Tory party policy, incl own voters  #COVIDー19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NadineDorries Testing is the key. 25% of NHS staff not working or in isolation bc  not been tested. Who knows how many of them are ok or not?? may just have a cold but bc symptoms are similar, they're told to stay away, Which then means NHS understaffed = more pressure on other staff etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NadineDorries Are you genuinely stupid or is it all part of a deliberate act?🤦🏻‍♂️ Testing doesn't provide cure, not one journalist or media person I've heard has said that. BUT testing does allow us to know who has it &amp; who doesn't, &amp; can isolate / treat accordingly. Not rocket science<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gerardjasper @MattHancock @carolecadwalla Yes I believe so.  Their CEO was on BBC news last week saying they supply the parts for the ventilators and can also easily make them at short notice. But they weren't asked 🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jessphillips One of 3 things Jess 1. Covering up mistakes getting things done, thereby buying time to rectify  2. All part of a plan.

<|startoftext|>@POCX100 Anything that is beneficial or saves lives is always a good thing. But seems Tories are have ulterior motives, as per usual. Don't forget that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@POCX100 Issue isn't they're being asked to make things. It's that our Corrupt Govt is choosing them 1st, even though can't do quick enough, as opposed to Co. who already DO make or can do quick, &amp; are NOT being asked. In meantime, people will die as a result. Who's responsible? #COVID19<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Heed immunity = many people will die unnecessarily. Now remember that when you see Tory party leadership. That's what they wanted to do (still are imo)  #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nigrugthug @MattHancock @carolecadwalla @FranceintheUK @bbclaurak @BBCNews @BethRigby @piersmorgan @SkyNews Do keep up. South Korea, Japan or closer to home, Germany.

<|startoftext|>#COVID19 #coronavirus W. T. F.🤯 We need unlimited ventilators yet they stopped them?!? Somebody in Govt, preferably .@MattHancock or some other senior minister, needs to explain URGENTLY what the fcuk is going on   https://t.co/66hVLOUnQW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deetoured @MattHancock @carolecadwalla Wow, I did not know that Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#COVID19  The cynical PR man in me😉 Public are doing better, but govt need more.  What would be easy way to really scare them into staying home, without initiating a full FULL Govt lockdown? Tell them PM &amp; Health Sec have both got #coronavirus then reiterate the slogans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#COVID19 #clapforNHS Ave Person misses/forgets email / letter -  Tough Shit, payments stopped, action taken etc etc. Tory Govt misses/ignores email from EU for help with acquiring Ventilators TO HELP SAVE LIVES -  We didn't receive email changes to Oops administrative error<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#COVID19 #clapforNHS  Never forget the reason our #NHS doesnt have enough ventilators when it needs the most.  10 years of DELIBERATE Tory Policies running the NHS down. And many of you voted these goons in again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#clapforNHS #ClapForCarers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#clapforourcarers  Amazing! The whole street was out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulbr1959 I was being semi-polite🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Aurelius @LoveRocksLondon @BrexitBin @MattHancock @carolecadwalla You mean like Ferry's 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanielleYorks I get it but why's contract offered to Co. with no experience of making them (Dyson) &amp; could take weeks, poss months, as opposed to Co. who makes already (MEC) &amp; available now. Also G-tech said can do 1k per day immediately, but Govt silent. might be too late for some with Dyson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ThursdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#COVID19 #DailyBriefing  'We're all in this together' says multi millionaire chancellor, married to the  daughter of an Indian billionaire🙄  Gonna be tough for them till June 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#COVID19 Well well well, why am I not surprised Tories are rowing backwards after the uproar in last 24hrs. Not exactly a good look handing a massive contract to a man who puts tax avoiding and personal profit above everything else   https://t.co/S0lZmq0ESn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#COVID19  Laura Kuenssberg must get a proper buzz when she always gets first dibs at the CV19 press conferences🙄 All those years as Tory party chief cheerleader paying off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The brexidiots really are struggling with the isolation, if this tweet is anything to go by 🤦🏻‍♂️😂 #covid19UK #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/GbQIFqB5R7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And proves that the contracts being awarded to Dyson, JCB etc are nothing more than corrupt politicians helping their Brexit mates out.  Absolutely pathetic  #COVID19 #ToryCorruption<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Covid19 #covid19UK   By not using EU resources at his disposal (as we're still in transition) to procure ventilators at far greater speed than from UK,  .@BorisJohnson @MattHancock &amp; Co are showing that THEIR (Brexit) PRIDE is far more important than saving any of our lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alloaboxman @cirian75 Honestly, even though not a fan, I think he'd have done much more during this crisis, for everybody, and so much quicker.  Long term, not so sure, his leadership never filled me with any confidence<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@darrengrimes_ Darren tweeting another pre-prepared tweet. Good boy Darren, well done.  Now run along, Sugar daddy  is waiting for his tea service<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RomaJ98275838 I agree 👍🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RomaJ98275838 Although tbf, he didn't help himself either, surrounding himself with uni  level advisors<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#COVID19  So far from last 10yrs of Tory Govts we've had : Austerity Hostile environment Windrush Grenfell-gate Brexit Shambles Sick of Experts EU Queue jumpers Carillion-gate Ferry-gate Rail-gate Fridge-gate Low skilled workers Bullying And now Ventilator-gate  Did I miss any?🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnLamont @JimPearson26 @MattHancock @carolecadwalla Absolutely agree with all hands on deck. But why not use ones who are experts, &amp; help THEM upscale, using likes of Dyson, G-tech etc to increase production. That's all hands on deck to me. Everyone helping each other to achieve common goal. way been done, seems like opposite<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattHancock Great, about time. Although you make it sound like you're doing them a favour🙄  Anyways, what about this   https://t.co/nfaKHIalj9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markhart84 @MattHancock @carolecadwalla Probably worse tbf. He's also had Fridge-gate😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrexitBin  https://t.co/nfaKHIalj9  Ditto 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveCairns1973 @BrexitBin @MattHancock @carolecadwalla Or maybe it's simply because Dyson's a mate of a mate  If you want tyres, you ask Michelin not Rolls Royce 🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LoveRocksLondon @BrexitBin @MattHancock @carolecadwalla In case you missed it, I'll spell it out for you C O R R U P T I O N  😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#COVID19  People say 3rd world countries are most corrupt. Wrong. WE ARE.  Happens here right under our noses. Ferry contract, Virgin rail, Carillion disaster &amp; now Dyson order.  Difference? 3rd world do it openly,  we call it lobbying &amp; hide it behind a motive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sure Dyson can and will make really good ventilators, if other products are anything to go by. But if I need more bread, I'll go ask Mr Warburton to make some, not Mr Heinz Baked Beans, just because they're also in food sector 🤷🏻‍♂️🧐🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AutobBig @ScaramangaJoe @campbellclaret Unfortunately, they're not mates with the right people 🤷🏻‍♂️ Now if you're Dyson, mega brexit lover and Tory party donor, that's another thing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#COVID19  Dyson - home appliance maker with NO PRIOR medical ventilator making experience, receives order from Govt to make 10k ventilators FROM SCRATCH. MEC Medical - UK ventilator manufacturer, making for years, receives NO order.  Why is that .@MattHancock 🤔  @carolecadwalla<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@colinrtalbot @PickardJE I don't believe a cap is fair. A salaried person doesn't have one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cirian75 @nadhimzahawi It actually makes me sick to think they're handing out contracts on a mates basis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Half a million volunteers?? Wow, that's Amazing 👏🏼👏🏼  When do they get their PPE @MattHancock ??  #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@montie @maitlis It's not hard is it Tim? WHEN WILL THEY BE AVAILABLE??  No wonder we're fcked with plebs like you crying about being questioned 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PMQs Corbyn - can you allocate more resources to the DWP so the 100k universal credit queue can be dealt with   Johnson - we're giving 1k more a year to everybody  Huh??🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#COVID19 #PMQs Everybody losing their shit about Prince Charles having #coronavirus  I truly wish him well. However a little perspective. He's a Prince with private testing, unlimited finances &amp; best health care at his disposal. Shame same fuss isn't made about everyone else<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PMQs #WednesdayThoughts  All Tory MPs have been given pre-screened questions. Pointless. All sucking up to him All saying he's a strong leader. I agree. Like the Capt of the Titanic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PMQs #WednesdayThoughts  Boris says Whatever it takes. He's just on repeat. Honestly, I don't believe a  Word he says.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PMQs #WednesdayThoughts  All I'm hearing from #BorisJohnson is We are doing this We are that We are doing fast as we can We are, We are, We are No specifics, just 'We are'  About right for Boris. Light on detail  #COVID19 #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>MPs taking one month break (maybe more) - FULL PAY Everyone who's in a job - 80% of salary Self employed / freelancers - £94 per week  @mrjamesob @Keir_Starmer @JamesMelville @davidschneider @piersmorgan @carolecadwalla @PeterStefanovi2  #WednesdayThoughts #COVID19 #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#COVID19 THIS is why got thousands of construction workers going to work, and others too. MIXED MESSAGING. It's not workers fault. What they supposed to do? Boss says come to work or don't get paid? With no effective govt help for self employed or freelancers, this will continue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#WednesdayThoughts  Parliament closes - Tories have No accountability or PMQs, Just pre-prepared statements. You can't protest as you'll be rounded up / arrested. In short, they can do what they want &amp; no one can say or do anything.  Hitler would be proud   #COVID19 #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darrengrimes_ Owt good comes out of this it's many will finally realise • Johnson is not a Leader &amp; will be gone soon • NHS/DWP has been DELIBERATELY underfunded last 10yrs by self serving, tax avoiding Tories, who're responsible for deaths of thousands • You're still a delusional Brexidiot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@panamadip Neither.  55 Tufton St😉  Which is where all the rest of top Tories (Gove, Rees-Moog etc) do too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scary as fook #COVIDー19 #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickeardleybbc How do you go from 5k to 12k in a few days?? Private health care. To me that's even scarier that the NHS has less than the private sector, and it's not even close!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#COVIDー19 #coronavirus 👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼THIS 👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IsabelOakeshott @MattHancock @BorisJohnson Spare a thought?? GFY This is what comes with the territory. Can't handle it? resign. Also, every wondered why Germany have such low mortality rate, with higher number of CV19? bc their health service is properly funded, unlike ours,10yrs of Tory piss taking.

<|startoftext|>@Otto_English In coming weeks 'Boris Love' will quickly end. Out of his depth &amp; no care or feelings for anyone but himself. A man who has affair with American whilst married with 3-4 kids, or  shacks up with someone 25yrs his Jnr while wife has cancer treatment is  compassionate as a dead rat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Travelito24 Truly Amazing 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#mondaythoughts Johnson's 'Dither &amp; Delay' act of last 2 wks, with unclear advice to population beside 'wash you hands', has all been for one reason.  Reach a point where he can push through Emergency Laws, allowing him to do what he wants dictator style #COVIDー19 #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice one Germany👏🏼 Maybe #BorisTheFckwit should do the same here   *if Elliott &amp; Cummings give him permission   #lockdownUKnow #COVIDー19 #StayAtHome  https://t.co/MCJnwI1zCQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cummings is in the cross hairs today with his alleged comments but don't miss the ACTUAL point.   Who put him there? Who's allowing to continue with this kind of thinking?   #COVIDー19 #StayAtHome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThePaulMachin No way. Take care maych 🤲🏼🙏🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Standard Tory protocol. Say one thing, do another🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️  #COVIDー19 #StayAtHome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#COVIDー19  Watching the Sunday press conference, seems to me Boris &amp; Co are trying their level best NOT to lockdown the UK, as opposed to Italy, France, Spain etc.  Almost like he's saying 'we can beat this in a different way' No.  You.  Can't.  #StayAtHome #lockdownUKnow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Confirmation that Johnson family head really is a twat.  #COVIDー19 #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Daily Mail reporter ask PM when are you going to bring in the police for curfew as people are not listening to you. Their readers will not be happy  #COVIDー19 #StayAtHome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tory Govt spent £100m on a Brexit message that achieved naff all.  How much are they spending on Information for the pandemic crisis that is literally killing people??   #COVID19 #COVIDー19 #StayAtHome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dolly_Joker Same to you 👍🏼🙏🏼🤲🏼  My gripe, regardless of party, is he had 3 wk head start (compared to Italy) and did virtually nothing. went one way then changed direction once most scientists said were wrong. Now playing catch up. I fear many will get ill/ lose their lives as a result<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dolly_Joker he's not PM 😉 Some would say thankfully, some would say sadly<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bullkaka1 @Daisybelll Yes, that's what's coming out. Probably same here. Eg Rees-Moog will surely have advised his clients<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If there's one thing that's been confirmed with UK #coronavirus outbreak and  Chancellor's interventions, it's that Austerity was a deliberate Tory party choice. All those DWP deaths could have been avoided, but for heartless PMs &amp; twats in Govt. FACT. #COVIDー19 #CoronaCrisisuk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bullkaka1 @Daisybelll I wouldn't put anything past these contemptuous bar stewards<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is all on Johnson, Cummings &amp; Co.

<|startoftext|>@allisonpearson Welcome to the real world. Now you know what thousands go through every single day. And why? bc of the policies of the numpties in charge for last 10yrs. But don't let your support of Cameron, May, Johnson &amp; Co get in the way 🙄  https://t.co/OIZnZjQx4K<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#FridayThoughts  At what point do people/media, esp right leaning, decide #BorisJohnson is simply out of his depth in this time of crisis? Floundering his way through briefings, nothing he's said this week gives me any confidence whatsoever.  All he has are slogans🙄 #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When #BorisJohnson says 'I have absolutely no doubt...' , what he ACTUALLY means is 'I haven't got a F-ing clue'  #COVID19 #coronavirus #StaySafeStayHome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PM @BorisJohnson has no idea how many Press conferences he's done this week. Here's a clue. It's Thurs. He's done one a day.  And we're expecting this guy to turn things around 🙄  #ThursdayThoughts #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Germany has SIX times more #COVID19 cases than UK (12k to 2k)  Yet somehow, UK has three times more deaths (103 to 28) I wonder why 🤔 10yrs of Tory #NHS underfunding = lack of equipment, Docs, Nurses &amp; staff got anything to do with it perhaps🤷🏻‍♂️ #ThursdayThoughts #ToryBritain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sign &amp; Retweet👍🏼 Not rocket science.  We're leaving EU.

So why not ask??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GNev2 @BorisJohnson Flippin Eck, I agree with GN!😂  Johnson won't do that, he's been bought off a long time ago by insurance companies. As for private health care beds, again people he knows who own them, won't put their businesses at risk and lose future funding. Most corrupt PM ever?  You betcha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GregHands Deeply irresponsible is you saying it was 18mths ago when was LESS THAN A YEAR AGO!  Still fresh in his mind it seems. Standard Tory protocol, stick up for each other, no matter what🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Spot on Ian. Disastrous by #BorisJohnson 🤦🏻‍♂️🤬 No leadership or action. Not willing to take responsibility or make a BIG decision.

<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @MattHancock Enabler with faux outrage🙄 It's Standard Tory policy.

<|startoftext|>👏🏼😂🤣😂 #Caturday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The truth. #BorisJohnson &amp; Co are not bothered about you or your relatives. Just like #Brexit it's only about money, now as then, THEIR money. What happens to you &amp; your family is secondary #ukcoronavirus #coronaUK<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#coronavirus  I'd have thought  .@michaelgove would be leading advice given to public, and not the chief science or chief medical officer. After all, didn't Gove say in 2016 we've had enough of 'experts'? 🤔 How times change... #COVID_19uk #justsaying<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson YOUR pathetic inactivity will be death of many people. YOUR Party's 10yr #NHS underfunding will cost lives. Every life lost will be bc YOU didn't act till in time.

<|startoftext|>@EnglishmanAdam @Ryanair Simple answer - Yes! flew back from Barcelona on 24th Feb, 2h15m of pure torture, must have been 2° or less! Freezing cold. Lots of coughing &amp; sneezing on the plane, no checks at Luton upon landing. 48hrs later I come down with a fever / bad cold. Coincidence? I think not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PickardJE What about all people she came into contact with, incl PM, MPs &amp; constituents, KNOWING she had cold or #coronavirus , as flippin health minister?!?!?

<|startoftext|>#WednesdayThoughts  Well well well  Word is Johnson will take paternity leave in the summer. Nice. Although 'Paternity leave' is an EU thing, rolled out in UK in 2003? So that's full paid leave for BJ, courtesy of EU rules!😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Sorry but can't take info given by Johnson, Gove, Raab etc for Coronavirus seriously. Same people said we'd have exact same benefits when we Leave EU, even signed leaflet saying so.

<|startoftext|>@happymargy @nicktolhurst 😉 BJ knew in Dec he was to be a father again, but they kept that news in the bag for a rainy day. Standard Tory protocol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesCleverly As opposed to you, who's not better than this. Pathetic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ukhomeoffice Yeah and who makes this 'Patriotic' piece of kit, British companies?🤔  And further, blue looks good, but we could have had that at anytime in last 30yrs under EU rules. WE choose not to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@allisonpearson @BBCNews As opposed to dirty toe rag Johnson, who has no integrity (constantly bullshitting &amp; lying) or decency (affairs whilst with wife who had cancer) and a man who would sleep with a moose if it meant it got him where he needed?🤔  #SundayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WestminsterWAG @carriesymonds Gove it a rest🙄 stench of your hypocrisy can be smelt in Brussels. Fact BJ was married &amp; having an affair whilst his wife had cancer, tells us levels of integrity &amp; decency he has. 0.

<|startoftext|>@JacquelineWale1 @owl_and_flowers @JimMFelton No GE, no Tory majority. Corbyn held the power. And even though Tories are about to wreak havoc with #BrexitLies, he could have stopped all that by not agreeing to GE.

<|startoftext|>@JacquelineWale1 @owl_and_flowers @JimMFelton As I said in another reply, Yes those who voted Tory, esp ex-labour, are a disgrace and. culpable.

<|startoftext|>@Boxneeds23 And so did the other guy. It's just that the Govt mysteriously 'lost' his documents from being here since childhood. Unlike Rolf who came as an adult.  Or are you saying a white Paedo has more privileges?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Slaine202 @uel77 @AyoCaesar Embarrassed that you're a reds supporter, with views like that.

<|startoftext|>@Slaine202 @uel77 @AyoCaesar You have no idea what you're talking about🤦🏻‍♂️ Why don't you just come out and say it - deport black people. Much easier than faffing around pretending it's something else🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's funny how money, power, ego trips and sugar daddies can change your mind - in 9 months.  #TuesdayThoughts  #Brexit #RejoinEU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@owl_and_flowers @JimMFelton Easy to blame populous. Yes on them too but everyone forgets. It wouldn't have happened if JC &amp; Swinson said no to Tory goading. Only beneficiaries?

<|startoftext|>Even though backdrop was Brexit in Oct/Nov, result of JC ego of not allowing Govt of Nat unity or saying NO to Johnson's GE is where we are now.  JC was NEVER gonna win, he knew it.

<|startoftext|>Whenever I see things like this, gets my blood boiling🤬 Not at Johnson &amp; or his heartless hateful Tories,  that's expected, but at Jo Swinson &amp; especially Corbyn. They let this happen.  #PMQs #bbcnews<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Maybe not bang on 3, say 6, but if they had, many of negative Leave concerns would have ended as many would have been asked to. WHY they didn't implement is the REAL question which should be asked.  Don't blame the EU or citizens, blame your Govt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All EU citizens register, like they have to now, and any that  a. Don't have a job  or  b. Not self employed or  c. Don't have enough means &amp; have med insurance, could be asked to go back. That was &amp; is the rule.  In a &amp; b, allowed healthcare, services etc as you're contributing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Theresa May, she of strong anti-immigration feelings (windrush, hostile environment) was home secretary for 6yrs, then PM for further 3. At any point in her 6yrs as home sec, she could have implemented EU 3 month easily &amp; quite simply<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Read that after transition, Brits visiting EU &amp; vice-versa, will be allowed to but only for 90 days (3mths) before needing visa/work permit to stay. Funny, that's give or take the 3 month rule EU introduced in 2004, but UK Govts didn't implement Ever wonder why🤔 #PMQs #RejoinEU<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Rather than being the day UK began process of leaving the European Union, could today be the start of the end of our own? Based on what Scotland and Ireland are saying / doing, me thinks so  #BrexitDay #Brexit #LittleEngland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perfect illustration of Brexidiots thinking. Fishing accounts for 0.04% of GDP, Financial services 16%, yet the way fishing industry was brought front &amp; centre by Leave, anyone would think it was 25%?? #BrexitDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Brexiters are no more. Long live Brexiters.  #Brexidiots are born  #BrexitDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lastly, well done to all those  who struggled. I urge you all to carry on what you've been doing last 3.5yrs. To coin a phrase - Battle was lost but war's not over.  This was one of many. Regroup💤 Rename😉 Keep strong 💪🏼 keep motivated 👍🏼 Keep believing 🙏🏼🤲🏼  #RejoinEU   5/5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ask tougher questions, ask them why, ask them what's the benefit, then fact check them live.  Don't let go until they answer properly &amp; honestly And if you can't or won't, step aside, and let someone who will  4/5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everything that happens from now is all on them.   Secondly, every journalist / TV presenter has to hold each &amp; every step Johnson's Tory govt takes to account.  They haven't sufficiently so far, some have, but from tomorrow there's no hiding or avoiding. 3/5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First things first - Titles. From tomorrow I won't be #FBPE or remoaner anymore, I'll be #Rejoiner  #RejoinEU starts officially 💪🏼  Also, Leavers won't be Brexiters, they'll be known as #Brexidiots  Totally theirs now. They asked for it, wanted it, got it, Now own it 2/5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BrexitDay  Gutted. Gutted that portion of population STILL actually think it's a good idea. Losing  Services Rights  Protections And especially our Freedom,  and for what?

<|startoftext|>@BestForBritain There's stupid, and then there's this level of stupid🤦🏻‍♂️ No self awareness whatsoever 🙄 They'd give up their nationality to stay put abroad🤦🏻‍♂️ I thought whole point of Brexit was to be proud Britishers!!  absolute morons<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmmaKennedy @AlisonMoyet Wait, what??😲🤨 so along with his children having a German passport, HE'S ALSO GOT ONE?? Seriously??🤦🏻‍♂️ If true, Someone needs to ask him (@mrjamesob ?) on Live Radio / TV why he's given up his British citizenship??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sday69 Exactly👍🏼😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If everyone's wondering why #RussiaReport has not been released as yet, it's quite simple. @BorisJohnson, Cummings, Gove &amp; Co are getting their ducks in a row, ready for when they have no choice BUT to release it.  #RussiaReportNOW #RussiaReportNOW #RussiaReportNOW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something that's always bugged me. If a Minister is sacked from Cabinet / Govt by PM, or tender resignation due to impropriety, How's it right that they are allowed / brought back by a change of leader? Surely same rules apply?🤔  #RussiaReportNOW #RussiaReportNOW  #RejoinEU<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Now they're giving up titles &amp; repaying money, which was his original gripe, what does Morgan have left? Sweet FA. So he goes after their relationship &amp; accuses her of domestic violence i.e psychological abuse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrexitBin Boris Johnson lies. Who knew? Only EVERYONE bar Tory / Leave voters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now if these 2 applied for the same leader / management role, ask yourself honestly, who would you give it to?  Given that RLB has not lead anything, whereas SirKS has held &amp; lead 2 of most important positions in UK, it's not hard to figure out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RLB - Para legal/Trainee 4yrs, became Solicitor in '07, Joined Labour '10, became MP '15.   Sir KS - Barrister '87, QC '02, worked on human rights cases here &amp; around world, QC of year '07, Director of Public Prosecutions &amp; Head of CPS 08-13, MP '15, made Privy councillor '17<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm struggling to comprehend how anyone can think or believe @RLong_Bailey could be better leader of the Labour party than Sir @Keir_Starmer  Where to start. Look at her CV, then look at his.  #LabourLeadershipElection<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With what's going on e.g. @RLong_Bailey for leader 😱 Trump as Potus🤯  Johnson / #Brexit 🤬 I swear someone's gone back in time or something cause it definitely feels like we're living in some weird, effed up parallel universe, right out of Back to the Future 2 #SaturdayMorning  https://t.co/mYiKVtClDi<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dgallagher000 @PaulBrandITV I'm hopeful she won't🙏🏼 Sir Keir has right credentials, ex Director of Public Prosecutions an amazing feat, knighted before became MP for services to his profession &amp; human rights, he would absolutely &amp; thoroughly dissect Johnson &amp; Co. She would be all protest ra-ra like Corbyn<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@campbellclaret Contradictions of RLB  Public didn't trust us,  but Corbyn is 10/10🤦🏻‍♂️ We failed on AS,  but Corbyn is 10/10🤦🏻‍♂️ We lost 2 GE on trot,  but Corbyn is 10/10🤦🏻‍♂️ I'm backed by same people who helped him lose, but Corbyn is 10/10🤦🏻‍♂️  #LabourLeadershipElection #LabourLeadership<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Adam_SH69 Worrying if true but don't think is. Members can't seriously think RLB, backed by SAME PEOPLE who helped JC lose 2 GE, would be better leader to take on Johnson &amp; Tories than Sir Keir, FORMER DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS, then No Govt for Labour in next GE #LabourLeadership<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DJaack1993 @Chrisballingall You mean northern, like Boris Johnson? We've tried protest party approach for last 4yrs (since ED) and clearly it's not worked, having lost 2 GE under Corbyn's dismal leadership. Labour need to stop faffing around with extreme politics &amp; take the centre-left option. They'll win<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adam_SH69 Is this the Tory pledge of putting more into the NHS??  Such a shame normal folk have to suffer. However those who voted Tory only have themselves to blame.  What's the nearest one after this closes?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Femi_Sorry Francois doing what he does best. Sweet FA. Just a hot air balloon. He cannot even accept the actual facts. And as soon as he can't answer to the facts, he resorts to default, like @piersmorgan does - shouty-shouty<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Having experienced racism first hand, I can say without fear that you have no idea what it is, just like others who also claim to be 'not' racist.

<|startoftext|>@skiologist @sturdyAlex Well he has for last 15yrs...🤷🏻‍♂️ His shyster supreme act will be found out. We just need someone to leak that damn Russia report &amp; Arcuri case to be investigated properly<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RLong_Bailey When you score current leader 10 out of 10 for leading party to its worst result since 1935, what does that say about your capacity for grasping reality?

<|startoftext|>@AlanAlanyoung30 @RLong_Bailey @damian_from @Alison_McGovern @mattforde It's just common sense. No problem accepting a GE/Ref decision if reached fairly &amp; honestly.

<|startoftext|>@AlanAlanyoung30 @RLong_Bailey @damian_from @Alison_McGovern @mattforde A normal functioning opposition with a strong leader (such as Starmer) would have pushed for all investigations into Vote Leave, Cambridge analytica &amp; russian involvement (Russian report) to be completed BEFORE we went ahead with Brexit/WA, NOT AFTER.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit Spare a thought for UK citizens living &amp; working in EU, esp those who couldn't vote in EURef. No more EHIC, No more freedom of movement.

<|startoftext|>They can do what they like &amp; thanks to you, no one can do anything.They absolutely DO NOT CARE about you, only about themselves.

<|startoftext|>What happened on Wed in HoC was start of 2 finger salute by Tories to : Working class of UK Citizens rights Youth of UK Child refugees  EU citizens in UK  All who voted Tory, esp in Labour areas, have voted to have BOTH your feet &amp; knees shot with Tory shotgun #ThursdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Deathly silence from ministers on Twitter, esp after votes in HoC Wed. Almost as if they genuinely (as opposed to fakely) don't give a s*** about anyone's view. Won majority, can do what they like without reply to common folk. Clearly not Elitist 🙄 #ThursdayThoughts #PMQs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great point Clive 👍🏼 So let's have the list @BorisJohnson  If Gen Soleimani did, Where &amp; Who? Have more Brit soldiers died than previously letting on (covert ops) Or is it just another BS lie? W need to know #PMQs #ThursdayThoughts<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nickynoo007 If any of us directly attack someone with bad language or threats, we will get shadow binned, temporarily suspended or worse, banned.   Yet why is someone like Trump allowed to threaten / abuse WHOEVER HE WANTS, and NOT get suspended?🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickynoo007 Funnily enough I feel same has happened/ing to me🤔  As well as being suspended day OF the GE. Put joke tweet up - which I'd seen similar on twitter - suspended for 12hrs, whereas others were not🤔 Asked but was told broke rules. So why only me? It's like VAR - inconsistent!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Racist &amp; Xenophobic. Yes you Morgan. It'd be easier if you just came out and admitted it. Next you'll be telling us you can't be as you've got black &amp; Asian friends🙄 a bit like your Tory chums saying Johnson isn't cause he's got Javed, Patel &amp; Cleverly in cabinet🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrexitBin Right now, it literally feels like nobody can do or say anything. PM, his ministers/cabinet, none of them are answerable to anyone. They can pass / do whatever they want🙄 Corbyn &amp; Swinson have royally effed up &amp; left us with absolute nothingness with their ego power grab GE🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrexitBin WTAF is going on?? Sat here raging!!🤬 How f*cking racist &amp; xenophobic are Tories?? So someone married, worked and lived here for 25yrs, but for some technicality, gets rejected settled status, can't appeal??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Telegraph @allisonpearson Funny Allison went all quiet on faked Leeds hospital incident that she was going to expose.

<|startoftext|>@Telegraph @allisonpearson Gutter level reporting, and that's being kind. I'm no friend or supporter of RLB but stooping to this level shows where your &amp; the papers heads at. Up Johnson's Tory arse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly. Was thinking something along these lines other day. Why have we only been quizzing/doubting election results since EU Ref?🤔 Why did people/teams (eg Cummings/Elliott/Banks/VL) go to lengths they did?🤔 Usually only one motivation 💷💶💷💵 #WednesdayThoughts #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyeCity_ Maybe you should ask yourself why anyone would pick a new Leader who's still backing a man who not only lost GE, but lost it with worst Lab result since 1935.

<|startoftext|>@SkyeCity_ 🤨 Agree on D &amp; D but intellect? Doubt it. Intellect got lying bar steward to where he is. Knows game. Backed by fellas who lost 2 GEs? Great idea! 😂🤦🏻‍♂️ FYI Blair won 3 GE with 418, 412, 355 MPs. Lowest win was 90 more than JC highest loss. **** for Iraq but UK was generally well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait, what??🤨 Apparently not just degrees, but other qualifications too. Can imagine will affect 100's of THOUSANDS of UK folk😟 Nice one Leavers 🙄 So much for unleashing potential, more like handcuffing to railing on Titanic 🤦🏻‍♂️  #WednesdayThoughts #Brexit #MorelikeBrexShit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ConorBurnsUK @wto Hi, was wondering when the vote takes place for selecting the WTO committee?  What, they don't vote? You're telling me they're UNELECTED BUREAUCRATS??😱😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ITVNewsPolitics @RLong_Bailey @PaulBrandITV @jeremycorbyn @UKLabour If RLB becomes leader, Labour will not win for next 2 GE. Simple as. Worst choice ever. RLB would be grated by Tory big hitters. Imagine her up against Johnson, Gove or Boom Box Cox 😱 She'd be done in seconds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She gave Corbyn's leadership 10 out of 10.  He lost TWO general elections. No sense of irony or self awareness. She defo means it. And now she wants to be leader 🤦🏻‍♂️ God help us 😱 #TuesdayThoughts #LabourLeadership<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StillDelvingH They won't get it 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@13sarahmurphy Seems Brexidiots &amp; some 'oh well, make best of it' types don't understand what's happening cause not affecting them personally. Yet. People like Sarah, who're impacted by Brexit, do. No amount of 'respect' or 'support' can make that feel better. Solidarity with you Sarah💪🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's quite simple @BorisJohnson  If you've got nothing to hide, why you hiding it? If it's got nothing of substance in it, let us see it? That you won't tells me you are hiding info which YOU KNOW will Damage You /Tories. My guess? We'll see it post 31at Jan   #TuesdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RLong_Bailey @damian_from @Alison_McGovern @mattforde The left (esp hard) had not one, not two but THREE goes at GE's within last 4yrs and lost each time. Spectacularly in last under Corbyn, worst defeat since 1935!! BLINDINGLY OBVIOUS what issue is. Majority of UK don't want Corbynism or Left wing politics. 3 defeats confirm so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*Caveat  As a result of Brexit, we will unfortunately lose some really good MEPs too. Such a shame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ONLY upside to leaving on 31st Jan? All Brexidiot party MEPs will be out of jobs, incl Farage😂 No more grandstanding, no more making UK look dumb to world. Hand back your iPads, Eurostar tickets, expense forms etc &amp; go back to anonymity before last May  #TuesdayThoughts #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Talk about 'hey, look at me, I'm hard me, I can do what I want and no one can do or say shit' 🙄🤦🏻‍♂️ Just imagine what Telegraph/Express/Mail would be saying if this was a one of Labour's lot... #TuesdayThoughts<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Pheonix55883062 @mikegalsworthy @Keir_Starmer @Andrew_Adonis So you voted for party that created universal credit, Foodbanks, homelessness, child poverty, zero hour contracts etc &amp; made Grimsby what it is over last 10yrs, and expect different results? And that's before Brexit negatives hit!  Delusional, self harming madness 🙄🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KayBurley He's talking out of his a-hole.  As a lawyer, he definitely knows it's not self defence when you,. the aggressor, attack first<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My guess is Russia report will get released AFTER 31st Jan - Brexit - by which point he thinks nothing can be done<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is not bad enough that PM #BorisJohnson is AWOL &amp; thinks world on brink of war is not good enough reason to come back from his hols or recall parliament, he's STILL not released Russia report said he would after GE.  WHY is that, WHAT'S he hiding?🤔 #ReleaseTheRussiaReport<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carolecadwalla Who's surprised?🙄 We'll look at this moment in history &amp; ask where was PM whilst world was on brink of war? Tanning his 12 pack body with his 24yrs younger than him Sugar baby on lounger next to him in Mustique🤦🏻‍♂️ So much for Churchill comparisons, more like Saddam in a hole<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When has the ASSASSINATION of a leader of sovereign country, IN another sovereign country, ever been 'self defence'? More like war crime.

<|startoftext|>PM @BorisJohnson sat in a 25k-a-week villa in St Lucia, flown out with Tax payers money, with his hand picked Tory plant girlfriend Carrie Symonds, sends a pre-recorded message of reconciliation.  Heres my take.   #NewYear #NotMyPM  https://t.co/u0CTDcH22v<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LauraPidcock Deluded🤦🏻‍♂️ 1. CORBYN LOST TWO GE.  HE WAS SHITE TWICE yet you're STILL blaming TB?🙄 2. Lessons? Here's one. TB a ****** for many things incl Iraq, but he won THREE GE 97 - 418 seats 01 - 414 05 - 355 So TB's LOWEST WIN almost 100 more than JC highest loss!  #LabourLeadership<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dgmoore75 @WolofBomberg @campbellclaret @SkySports @GNev2 @BorisJohnson Take it from a man with experience of colour that just because Johnson has few 'brown people' in his cabinet, doesn't mean it's diverse.

<|startoftext|>THIS is leadership. Not shameless man leading Labour today, who blames everything &amp; everyone but himself. GB took full responsibility, even though he got 80 more MPs than JC!

<|startoftext|>🤨 Johnson agrees WA with  amendments with EU before GE. Parliament today debating / voting on WA, known as WA Bill - WITH CHANGES. But that then means it will be different to WA agreed with EU.  So why would EU vote/agree to something that's been CHANGED?🤔  #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PMQs #Brexit   Corbyn is a lame duck leader. Tories are sat there falling asleep. That's not to say what he's saying he's wrong, it's just that his words carry no threat. And they know it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn That's like saying water's wet🙄  We KNEW this!! Stop with Martyr in defeat act. Embarrassing🤦🏻‍♂️ Reality is not being good enough opp leader. Weak &amp; ineffective.Tories chose clown like BJ &amp; won, imagine if someone half decent! Don't understand why still hanging around<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SKinnock @goodclimate @stephenkb @Samfr only reason you get asked anything is because of your surname, not because of your intellect. talking crap everyday trying to be 'relevant' but to most sensible people you're talking out of your arse. Seriously if I was your dad, I'd be putting you in the naughty room.  Forever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 Yes, &amp; also weak opp leader who couldn't lay glove on BJ in all time he was PM before GE.  Getting sick of saying it but JC is not, &amp; never was, a Leader. not even a decent manager. He should step down now, not in 3mths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ToryFibs Awful  And I'm betting those who walked by all voted Tory as well.  This is where we're at.  No humanity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How the F🤬🤬🤬 are @SeumasMilne &amp; Karie Murphy still in work when they oversaw strategy for the worst election result by Labour since 1935, with so many MPs and staff losing their jobs. So much for @jeremycorbyn  saying for the many. More like for HIS Few🙄  #Labour #<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Daniel93490317 He's defo a twat, that's for sure. But as @guyverhofstadt said today, there's no guarantee that EU Parl will automatically pass the WA. They too have to vote on it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Rachael_Swindon The system is shit and it's a tragedy that these people will suffer, but it's time for JC &amp; Co to step aside Had 2 chances. Failed both times, esp 2nd. Times up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Daniel93490317 That's thing, he (&amp; advisors) never seem to understand what's needed when. Always make the wrong choice. JC maybe good man, but never a leader. You'd think he'd at some stage he'd get through but clearly majority were not happy with him, esp as voted a baboon in instead<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#CorbynWasRight Seriously? Get over yourself🙄 If he's right, why didn't he win??🤷🏻‍♂️ He had not one but TWO attempts putting his argument forward &amp; lost, BOTH TIMES.

<|startoftext|>A Temporary leader like Harman, Becket or Benn comes in, stabilises while party chooses who it wants as new leader and direction they go in.  So @jeremycorbyn, pls start the process by stepping down now.  #LabourParty #LabourLeadership #WednesdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We thank you for your efforts &amp; wish you well but it's time to move aside now, along with your advisors &amp; cronies.  By losing again, you don't get to reflect on or have say in which path party goes. You had your go and failed. The New leader will.  #LabourLeadership<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@jeremycorbyn If truly care about Labour party, do the right thing. Step down immediately. Not in 3 mths, not in Jan, NOW.  You Failed. Lost GE again, twice now, this time worse. Show Humility. Embarrassing &amp; damaging hanging around #LabourLeadershipElection  #LabourLeadership<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jessphillips It's not rocket science. Corbyn &amp; his crew lost. Again. Whatever they were trying to do failed.  Only 'Leave' I agree on is him. He &amp; his lot need to Leave NOW. Not in 3mths, not next month. NOW. @MaryCreaghMP is right, he revel in it.  No shame at all  #LabourLeadershipElection<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@davidschneider When I see shit like this, it winds me up!🤬 The guy just lost his seat! What happened to friggin democracy?? And Morgan, said she was stepping back as MP / minister. Suddenly she's not. Absolute joke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aka_Brute @YorkshireLad_87 So you don't know how it works🙄 EU 3 month Rule. Have to be in full-time work or self emp = paying into country's system, or more than enough to live off AND med ins (not burden on state) if not, HAVE TO GO BACK. If was applied here, would have sorted EU Immigration instantly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aka_Brute @YorkshireLad_87 So UK is more multicultural than France, which has highest population of people of African origin outside of Africa, or Germany, that took in 1m refugees, or Sweden, or Denmark?  Seriously, using the term 'very white' to describe the WHOLE of Europe??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aka_Brute @YorkshireLad_87 🙄 Funny in last few days last 4 people I spoke to about GE/brexit, 3 were leavers. All said immigration 1st. could name them! Btw do you actually know about EU 2004 rule or deliberately avoiding, just like Leave leaders. The answer was &amp; is right there but Govts didn't use it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hard Leavers wanted out because they were fed up of unelected bureaucrats in EU.  But Nicky Morgan &amp; Zak Goldsmith - BOTH UNELECTED - being give peerages &amp; keeping their ministerial jobs is different 🤔🙄🤦🏻‍♂️  #TuesdayThoughts #ToryLiars #Hypocrites<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aka_Brute @YorkshireLad_87 Whenever I talk to leavers (alot in last 2yrs) they always, ALWAYS, bring up immigration as main reason. It could easily have been controlled with EU 2004 3 month rule, which other EU countries use. First Lab for 6yrs, then Tories for 9yrs, didn't implement. Ask yourself, why?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aka_Brute @YorkshireLad_87 Total BS. In 2010, less than 1% of people in UK gave shit about EU. That's half a mil out of 67m. What red tape affects everyday person? None. Trading with wider world is done within EU, but again that's leave BS. Cultural indifference? Is that another way of saying Xenophobia?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RLB4Leader Is this a parody account?  cause if it's not, you do realise you're taking the piss out of current leader by saying he's not smart or principled, can win elections or stands up for democratic socialism?😂  Talk about dumb 🤦🏻‍♂️  #LabourParty #LabourLeadership<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KLear1966 @darkalley11 Not surprised said nobody,  except the Gullibles in said areas. You reap what you sow 🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 You've literally just slapped yourself in the face😂 How old is Corbyn? 65+!!  If he can't connect with his own generation, not once but twice, then clearly he's the problem.  Can do all sorts of stats all day long, fact remains, he didn't resonate with majority of voters - TWICE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyoCaesar ICYMI Lab lost GE in 2017, What did they get right? 🙄 Before you say 'got more seats than '15' etc So what? What good did it do? Only reason gotnvotes in '17 was Remain lent their vote. In '19 didn't, plus lost northern Leave ones too, hence worse. Bottom line? JC can't win GEs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He doesn't need to be part of the reflection period.  He had his opportunity twice and couldn't break through. Imagine him doing PMQs, he and LP will be ridiculed mercilessly by Johnson &amp; co. Temp leader can side step it.  #LabourLeadership<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chatter Corbyn's to be Leader till March.

<|startoftext|>Did I miss something??🤨 You lost. Again. Which debate did you win? Which terms did you rewrite? You lost. Again.  Two GE now. That's same record as Kinnock.   Quicker you &amp; your lot are out, quicker #LabourParty can start to move forward with MPs, not backwards  #SundayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sillyshib Sheer Arrogance that they knew better than the guy who won a GE 3 times🙄🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tezilyas  I respect your opinion in lead up to GE but Please see below tweet. Fyi I wanted Labour to win😌 but it's time for real change at the top.  JC had his chance. Twice.  #LabourParty  https://t.co/BJ6unwKFDd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@jeremycorbyn goes on about reflection &amp; citing 2017 GE. stupid or something?? ICYMI, lost THEN too, LOST worse now! Reflection can only start when JC &amp; his crew are out. New leader can reflect &amp; shape future direction, NOT those who lost twice   #LabourParty #SundayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haggis_UK So it's ok for his Tory party to want leave a Union &amp; ask the people, but its not ok for SNP to what to do same.  There's a word for this...?🤔  #indyref2 #UKElection #SNP<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Rozkez67 Agreed, was thinking same yesterday morning. Said to my wife, for first time ever in my life, feel like doing it. Labour is where my heart is but if cannot see AFTER 2 GENERAL ELECTIONS what problem is, they have no place being there. Sweep out all JC advisors #Labour #CorbynOut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cirian75 Agreed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElvisLeeBoy @AnneWheeldon @davidschneider @mrcuthers But we knew this already, no? Why keep moaning about it, it won't change that fact. So maybe you (as in LP) should change to adapt to the situation.  Keep doing same thing with same leader is going to give the same result.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnneWheeldon @davidschneider @mrcuthers You got 3/4 of that sentence right He was electable - won his seat resoundingly, but 'electable Leader'? The Results say No.  Until people like yourself accept that undeniable fact, especially as he's now lost 2 GE's, the party cannot move on.  #Labour #CORBYNRESIGN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jon_Allsop It's a complete joke. They should all pack their bags NOW &amp; F off! 4 elections, 2 GE, 5 if include Ref, all lost.  On what basis do they get to stay on and reflect??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>👏🏼👏🏼 @jessphillips for Leader? Absolutely  #LabourParty #UKelection2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyoCaesar Funny how you didn't say any of this after the last GE when Corbyn lost🤔 or the Locals,🤔 or the Euro elections 🤔 His record. Lost 4 elections on trot, 5 if add his 'contribution' to Ref.  Deeper questions than brexit? Not really. It's Plainly obvious. just need to accept it<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SalmaYaqoob Sorry but this is nonsense. Remain party's won more votes than leave ones.  The policies may have been popular to you, but clearly didn't translate across. Why is that? 🤔 Maybe the leaders should look at themselves and ask why is that, instead of just blaming Brexit 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn Sadly, you didn't do either. If you are what you say you are, Do the honourable thing &amp; step down ASAP, not when 'you've reflected' - I'll do that for you.

<|startoftext|>@sajidjavid And a great day for your far right followers - Tommy &amp; Katie.  You must be so proud to have their support<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BpsmithUk @holski_beat That's their job - make him look bad! But why did JC give them so many opportunities over years, &amp; still not learn from it? Did they meet Hamas? Or IRA? or Press TV? Or why did he avoid 3 x 1m+ marches in his city? (Going to Blackpool for one)  RW Media are t**** but it's on him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tony_nog @IAmMardikins @UKLabour Spot on Tony 👍🏼  Tweet 10 is probably the most damning on Labour. It was right in front of their eyes - looking at it - but they couldn't SEE it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perfectly summarised thread of Labour  #UKElection<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn And it failed to resonate🙄 Look at the numbers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MackemScouse @JackEO_Robinson Check this 🤷🏻‍♂️   https://t.co/jaUkeKhGse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wtf We must change this  #UKelection2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What to take from this result. Well Trumpism won. Lies won. Fake news won.  Just as Trump wouldn't release his tax returns, here Johnson wouldn't do @afneil interview or release the Russia report. Just as Trump used a simple slogan - MAGA, here BJ used GBD.  #UKelection2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MackemScouse @JackEO_Robinson Yes, there are some good people who could be involved but all those close to /around JC who have advised him have to go. This loss is on them.  To use another footy example, he must resign, get a caretaker manager in whilst the board look at the options 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheNewEuropean Disheartening<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MackemScouse @JackEO_Robinson Agreed re Iraq but can't deny he won 3 times. Easily. Yes. Yes It's not an overreaction, It's reality. You lose - You out. He couldn't beat worse Tory PM, who's all the things I can't even begin to list. Why is that? He doesn't cut through<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MackemScouse @JackEO_Robinson So only Lab leader to win, 3 times, &amp; you think it's his fault (not others), as opposed to JC who's had 2 goes, lost twice &amp; came out worse 2nd time.  Huh?🤨 Mate, struggling here🤷🏻‍♂️ No Blair fan but you can't do shit unless you win &amp; in Govt. clearly majority didn't want JC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nealmeyer @novaramedia @AyoCaesar @AaronBastani You are deluded🙄🤦🏻‍♂️ HELLO??? You lost. Again. Twice now. Worse than before.  WHICH PART OF THAT DON'T YOU GET???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Corbyn talks about needing to reflect. Mate, the numbers are in. On YOUR WATCH, You lost. AGAIN. BIG TIME. No reflection needed. You had your chances (2) Hand back your pass and off you toddle to the allotment.  #UKelection2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact that the Tories have taken the slogan 'The People's Government' after winning are openly taking the mick out of the Labour leadership   #UKelection2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmmaKennedy It's not rocket science👆🏼 #UKelection2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MackemScouse @JackEO_Robinson I personally liked many of policies, was desperate for change but his team are the ones who guide him and therefore many are as responsible. We need to face reality. If Johnson stays for 5yrs, it'll have been 50yrs since a Lab leader other than Blair won. That is damning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>👇🏼 #UKelection2019 👇🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MackemScouse @JackEO_Robinson C'mon Andy, the results are catastrophic.  In footy terms, if Labour was a team, Corbyn it's manager &amp; rest his staff, they'd be sacked for poor run of results, lost dressing room or both.  Same here.  After 2 bites at the cherry &amp; 60 lost MPs, it's time for new style of play<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Grenfell happened in this constituency on the Tories watch, and the opposition STILL couldn't win🤦🏻‍♂️😒 Shame on you Labour. Shame on you Libs.  #UKelection2019 #Grenfell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan You've got 6.9m followers yet only 41k liked this tweet🤔 Not really an endorsement🙄 I would have expected at least 52% to have any validity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Corbyn says won't lead Labour into next election. No Shit Sherlock🙄 Shouldn't lead them into next week never mind in 5yrs!!  #UKElection<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be in no doubt, whatever's happened is purely &amp; simply down to 2 people. Corbyn &amp; Swinson. They could have said no to Johnson's GE call but both thought they were bigger than their boots. Now look at them  #UKElection #UKelection2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The start of #RejoinEU ? Like the phoenix, rise from the ashes  #UKElection #UKelection2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Starmer with Phillips?  #UKElection #LabourParty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sazmeister88 We're all upset &amp; angry. Some people cross the line and really shouldn't. Apologies for any grief you've had. It's not on you. You believed in him, like may others, but in reality, he's not that guy. Good man, clearly not a good Leader. Time for a new approach<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent👏🏼 Ranty Thread of the day (so far) Maybe @OwenJones84 could come out from under the covers and have a dose of this reality.  #UKElection #UKelection2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eva_magdalena1 @BrexitBin Maybe but here it's Corbyn kept quiet last few weeks in hope anything is better than Johnson.  However I saw so many things was doing wrong or not connecting, but I like many others, bit our tongues &amp; kept quiet.  No more. 2 trys, 2 losses. Project hard left is over  #UKElection<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When a footy team loses a string of matches, the manager is under pressure. Few games to turn it around or they're out, along with their coaching staff.  Corbyn has had his the last 2.5yrs &amp; it's only got worse.  It's that time  #UKElection #GE2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When the leader of a party can't beat Johnson with his known to everyone and out in the open charge sheet, you know it's time to do something else  #UKElection<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#UKelection Northern towns / constituencies absolutely hammered by austerity, voting in a Tory MP, must be amongst the stupidest things I've seen or heard in my life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another one😲  #UKelection2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#UKElections2019  Mining towns decimated by the Tories for decades, have just voted in....? The Tories!🤦🏻‍♂️  Sheer stupidity of this is beyond me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrexitBin *on track<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrexitBin Yep. Now no more defending. Times up for Project Corbyn &amp; Co. Go back to back benches and protesting again. Let's get Labour back in track<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 Owen, stop with the BS deflectiion. This is on you and your guy. Own it. It wasn't just GE but the last 2.5yrs. He couldn't break through. And now it's time to step aside. All of you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#UKelection2019  Johnson will probably do that interview with @afneil now 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The reality. Corbynism is done.  #UKElection #UKelection2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come back David Milliband, all is forgiven. The (Labour) Messiah  #UKElection #UKelection2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheAndyMaturin @damocrat @PickardJE You mean it'd be worse than now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CCHQPress @BorisJohnson @Conservatives Now lets have that Russia report out,, the Acuri case, the ambassador leak, the Vote leave case, Johnson's corruption case with mayor's office.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#UKelection2019 #GE2019  Finally! out of Twitter purgatory😅🙏🏼 And Fuming😤 .@jeremycorbyn &amp; Co  - ENOUGH🤬  You had your chance.  TWO manifestos, TWO GE, LOST TWICE. The project failed.  No reflection, No need to stay on, Stand down with IMMEDIATE EFFECT<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The @bbclaurak postal scandal.  Only 2 PoV 1. She's Right Which then asks how safe are actual postal votes if BBC hack knows? Also illegal to say  2.

<|startoftext|>#GE2019  A man who has strived for peace &amp; equality all his life is branded a 'terrorist sympathiser' &amp; won't get the vote.

<|startoftext|>#GE2019  What is it that Johnson, Gove, Javed, Raab, Patel, Hancock all have in common? When you look at them, you see people who all lack natural human empathy towards others. If you vote Tory, we can only assume you're the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@UKLabour &amp; .@LibDems candidates - BE HONEST  Where you know you can't win, DO THE RIGHT THING, STAND DOWN AND BACK THE CANDIDATE WHO CAN BEAT THE TORY  It's Now or Never. Don't waste this moment.  #GE2019 #VoteTacticallyActually #VoteTactical<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Mc_Heckin_Duff @NimkoAli You mean people like Nimko Ali's parents who probably emigrated here to make UK their home?🤔 She is an embarrassment 🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NimkoAli Whataboutery 🙄 PM isn't homophobic. He's ALSO Xenophobic, Racist &amp; Islamaphobic. not like didn't write novel using N word, or black people have watermelon smiles, or letterbox women. But you keep defending him.  Needs token brown people like you to make him look legit #GE2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adam_SH69 No one will miss him (or his mates) He's still bitter he didn't get a knighthood from Labour. I was there. As per Tory way,, they're all money grabbers who don't care about society, only themselves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattHancock Intimidate? He walked into his finger😂 And You ran away rather than face the questions. Coward<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#bbcqt #bbcnews Just listened to Laura @bbclaurak report on BBC news regarding the Leeds hospital overreaction, and even though she rowed it back a tad, still had her Tory bias in her voice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#bbcqt  Ol' Farage is bored out of his brains😂 He's sat there thinking 'what an I doing here?'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bhikkubodhi @joswinson Exactly, they're all responsible but sadly they've legged it and left her holding the blame can 🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#bbcqt  I'm bored of Poor ol Jo @joswinson getting attacked for what were Tory policies. She was junior minister and one piece in the Cameron machine. She didn't make the final decisions. He did, they did  Give her a break FFS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#bbcqt  All out attack on Nige😂 Angela Rayner absolutely smashing Farage 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sillyshib @itvnews @GiselaStuart My guess - visuals. They're trying to make it look like Leave campaign rally I believe they're in Sunderland, and we all know what happened there. The irony being BJ has said he's fed up of EU citizens taking UK for granted as their home. Er, one stood next to you mate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GE2019  Senior Tory sources say Labour activists were taxi'd in to hospital to protest. Do 'one seat bikes' count as Taxis nowadays?🤔  #GetToriesOut #GetJohnsonOut  #VoteTactically<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peston @MattHancock I apologise?? That's it. What this tells us is Senior Tory sources could tell you anything and you'd tweet it, which means ?  At least had decency to say he walked into his arm, unlike Laura @bbclaurak who didn't have guts, and thinks it 'doesn't look like a punch'🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbclaurak Doesn't look like a punch thrown??🤨 Shouldn't that be NO PUNCH THROW!🤬 Simply embarrassing🤦🏻‍♂️ Words have consequences and yours are clearly calculated to benefit someone, without first checking. Further proves what most know - you're in the pocket of Johnson &amp; Cummings. #GE2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imagine being polish dude Lucasz, who intercepted terrorist at London Bridge last week, waking up to read this crap from the PM  🙄🤦🏻‍♂️🤬🤬  #mondaythoughts #GE2019 #VoteTactically #GetJohnsonOut #GetBorisOut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@73henny @MarieAnnUK @Scotland__UK You're still Living in past 🙄 BJ also Russian funded too so all in all, the PM is in pocket of Foreign state. But yeah, keep picking on 25yr old piece of info in which his motive was to bring about peace, which funnily enough, Labour Govt, not Tory, did. FTR, I'm no JC fan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimMFelton 'B please Bob'  😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TKispeter So sorry for the distress caused by the Scummy PM  🙏🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@73henny @MarieAnnUK @Scotland__UK Or in your case, vote for a terrorist funded man instead 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The way .@BorisJohnson behaved in .@itvnews interview with .@joepike confirms what most have known all along. A HEARTLESS LOW LIFE who has NO REGARD for anyone/anything other than own glory.  Vote tactically to Get these Scummy Tories out!  #GE2019 #GetBorisGone  #VoteTactically<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow, let's make this happen! C'mon Labour / Libs, Just Do it!!  #VoteTactically #TacticalVoting  #GE2019 #GetBorisOut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't forget your working class roots.  Tories DON'T CARE about working class. *Never have, Never will*  Don't be fooled again. All issues you are or may face are NOT because of EU or Citizens, it's because of Tory policies. FACT. Remember that when you Vote  #GE2019 #ToriesOut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Grimsby &amp; West Bromwich voters - Pls don't make mistake of thinking Tories give a shit about you.  THEY DON'T *Never have, Never will* Or voting for them is going to 'Get Brexit Done' THEY'RE LYING.  *Always have, always will*  #GE2019 #VoteLabour<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What Melissa said - IN CAPS!  #GetBorisOut #GE2019 #xenophobia #racist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@corsarof One of most difficult polls to vote in 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And yet if still want to vote for them after all those things, What does that say about you? Your hate for Corbyn is far more important that trying to sort the issues? Put hate aside &amp; DO THE RIGHT THING Vote them out of power on Thurs #VoteNotTory #GetBorisOut #VoteTactically<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everything that's wrong in our country today is because of Tory policies. Even Brexit. They lie, mislead, hide information, corruption, created austerity, homelessness, child poverty, food banks, Universal credit, Windrush scandal, Grenfell disaster, broke rule after rule.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#mondaythoughts  Traditional #Labour voters thinking of voting Tory b/c of Brexit - PLS RECONSIDER. #GE2019 is more than Brexit.

<|startoftext|>@JamesMelville 1012 people do not represent 47m reg voters. Hope exists IF .@UKLabour &amp; .@LibDems STOP FAFFING AROUND attacking each other. Look at bigger picture - Get Tories out.

<|startoftext|>@UKLabour FFS 🤦🏻‍♂️On drugs at Labour social media team?🙄 Where Lab can't win, why waste  a vote? It's about Voting tactically to get Tories out.

<|startoftext|>@ReluctantRelict @GuitarMoog @rose_lingering So basically, like Steve says about Johnson, you don't give a shit either🙄 Cause if you've read the thread AND STILL! think the opposite of all that is not worth voting for, you truly mustn't give a shit🤦🏻‍♂️  Thanks for clarifying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly. @bbclaurak as the sister,.with @Peston as the brother of the husband. After 10yrs of beaten the shit out of, why would anyone want more of the same??  #VoteTactically #TacticalVoting #GE2019 #SundayThoughts #GetJohnsonGone #GTTO<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Agreed. Do Labour Leave voters want more inequality, b/c the man you may vote, thinks it essential &amp; does. There won't be any inequality for his wealthy, elite mates.

<|startoftext|>@bbclaurak Staggering🙄 If @jeremycorbyn not fit for office as Chief Rabbi says, does that mean by saying 'vote with your conscience' he's saying a KNOWN Lying, cheating, adulterous, racist &amp; corrupt man, such as @BorisJohnson, IS fit for office.

<|startoftext|>Not surprised. As a famous (Tory) journo once said, pre election polls are not just to give an indication who's likely to win, but more to INFLUENCE your vote.

<|startoftext|>@itvpeston @NickyMorgan01 So what you're saying  .@NickyMorgan01 is that it's perfectly ok for Tory party to lie, cheat, manipulate &amp; mislead - as long as it's done within reach of Westminster.

<|startoftext|>@OxfordDiplomat @Iloveautumn2 More to the point, if, as he says, people 'don't give a toss about social media cut &amp; thrust',  WHY change the title??

<|startoftext|>So @jack @Twitter  It's ok to suspend Ralf's twitter acc who, like many others, was merely mimicking as a protest the @Conservatives press acc, but NOT suspend the actual account which did it in the first place🤔 WHY?? Scared?  #LeadersDebate #WednesdayThoughts<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mikegalsworthy Mike, get Labour to stop acting like they're gonna win by 100 seats🙄 &amp; be more realistic. Unless work with others, Tories are gonna win. It's as Simple as that.

<|startoftext|>What's actually funny, but not in a funny way, is #Tories always go back to the same old BS - Immigration, as they did in Referendum too.  Tapping into xenophobia, a Tory speciality<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tory party / .@patel4witham promise to lower immigration🧐 Now where've I heard that before?🤔 Ah yes, in 2010, 15 &amp; 17!!

<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 Seriously??🙄 WAKE UP! #GE2019 should be about stopping Tories - WHATEVER IT TAKES! There are many seats unwinnable for Lab, always be Tory/LDs, yet YOU'RE splitting vote by standing candidates🤦🏻‍♂️ Lab can't win on its own. Only by working TOGETHER is it possible💪🏼 #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WHAT is it people see in Johnson, Gove, Patel, Raab, Javed etc, that I cannot?🧐  WHY so many would STILL vote for party that's 100% self created ALL negative situations in UK over last 9yrs, of which, some used as part of Leave' Ref strategy?  #StopBrexit #GTTO<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MorrisinMilan @Tony_Robinson That's what I mean. If Lab can't win, why stand?  The priority HAS to be stop the Tories by all means necessary = possibility of stopping madness of Brexit.  Fighting each other = they will retain/win seats again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And there it is.

<|startoftext|>@Tony_Robinson Well said. Reality Check needed by both leaders. In close seats, fair enough.

<|startoftext|>@bbclaurak Right on cue another one! Senior BBC figure using a tweet against Farage's decision to work for her mate Johnson 🤦🏻‍♂️🙄  Don't see same level of fuss over Johnson's coverup job of the Russia report, which by all accounts, implicates him &amp; Tory party.

<|startoftext|>In summary, Johnson said No checks: ROI to NI then NI to GB, or  GB to NI then NI to ROI.  If that's case, all EU states do is is ship things to Dublin, drive them up to NI, then ship across to GB - WITH NO CHECKS or TARIFFS!!🧐😂  #GE2019 #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>How stupid does Evans look?🤦🏻‍♂️  If deal is so good for NI, why doesn't DUP, party that has been BRIBED to back Tories through thick n thin these last 2.5yrs, accept it??🙄 PAID to vote with them, didn't even do that cause know it's a sh*t deal!!😂 #Brexit #StopBrexitMarch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Because the first was achieved by lies and breaking the Law? Not hard is it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CarolineFlintMP Legally binding? From Johnson??  Show us the legally binding document, Not words in a tweet.  #BrexitDeal #PeoplesVoteMarch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Irony. Tories given billions to DUP to support them in votes in HoC since 2017 GE, only for them to not to vote with them today, And MPs from .@UKLabour who are bitterly opposed to Tory Austerity etc are now going to vote with Tories - for free! 🤦🏻‍♂️🤬 #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@UKLabour MPs. Never forget what REF was all about in 1st place - Tory party infighting. If you vote for this No-Deal WA, when time comes at GE, DON'T EVEN THINK about talking about damage Tories have inflicted. YOU were part of it  #BrexitDeal #StopBrexit #PeoplesVoteMarch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great point #StopBrexit #LiarJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UKLabour MPs thinking of voting for Johnson's #SurrenderDeal, ask yourself just one question. Why are staunch No Dealers, Tory ERG, who've been ND since day dot, happy to go along with this?🤔 If you answer honestly, you'll never vote with it #BrexitDeal #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>EXACTLY why Rees-Mogg, Baker etc are happy. They know if Labour's self-serving MUGS .@CarolineFlintMP  .@SKinnock help get this over the line, they can frustrate next phase &amp; go for ND again. Basically, it'll be their fault country crashes. ARE THEY SO STUPID??  #VoteDownTheDeal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Way I see it, Northern Ireland is kinda being annexed by Johnson and his gang of ERG useful idiots  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Part 2 And most worryingly, by agreeing to it, they will lower living standards, lesser rights and fewer protections for their constituents. I thought they were looking to protect them, not blast them away by accepting #LiarJohnson's word?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour MPs led by @SKinnock thinking of voting for @BorisJohnson's Theresa May-Lite WA, remember one thing. This is man who said at not one, but TWO DUP conferences he wouldn't allow a border in Irish sea, even resigned over it as Foreign sec. YOU TRUST THIS MAN???🤔 #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So there you have it. from the horses mouth. Tories want No Deal, all they're doing is deferring it to next year.  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*this isn't against NI or its beautiful people, it's simply pointing out that Scotland, Wales &amp; England clearly mean more to Johnson &amp; his right wing cronies, that they're prepared to cut NI adrift from rest of UK. Unification awaits mehinks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#StopBrexit Wait, Why's it OK for people /businesses of Northern Ireland* to have FoM &amp; Frictionless trade, but rest of us can't??🤔 Thought they were part of UK?

<|startoftext|>@ChrissieGrech @ledredman @UKLabour Who's knows Chrissie, maybe it's their part of their long term plan. crash out (with or without WA), let Tories get the blame,  ride in to save the day.  Seriously miscalculation. They will lose big time if this happens  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toadmeister I dunno, maybe recent experiences 🤔 It's not like your leader said last year AND this July at DUP conference wouldn't do what he's now proposing in WA, is it?🙄 In normal, everyday language we'd call him a LYING TWO FACED BAR-STEWARD  But what would I know, eh 🤷🏻‍♂️  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#FridayThoughts Why are Lab MPs voting for BJ's WA allowed to keep whip?🤔 Any who do vote for sh*ttest of sh*t proposals should be kicked out immediately.

<|startoftext|>What is it with these idiot Labour MPs?!?🤦🏻‍♂️🤬🤬 This is NOT about #Brexit now, it is more than that. You vote with Johnson, YOU not him, will be blamed for what's gonna happen. Austerity? That was a starter. main course is about to be served. Don't Do It  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funny. .@SKinnock &amp; Co are the new DUP  All Johnson has to do is get his bribery cheque book out.  #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote #bbcqt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Johnson can still No Deal in a year's time, even if this passes now. Why? Because it's not legally binding, only politically. And we all know what politicians do...🙄  #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Regardless Leave or Remain, ANY Labour MP eg @SKinnock @CarolineFlintMP thinking of voting for BJ's proposal, will be doing 3 things 1. Start of End of Union 2.

<|startoftext|>@cirian75 👍🏼 Don't think need to renew brother, unless you change address.  Whatever way they do it, should be a free service, just as issuing NI is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't see why this is a problem, most country's have them. Will cut out a load of crap esp for who have to show ID at shops etc. Re: Voter fraud reason, that's a red herring by Tories just to rake in some money, v m doubt happening. tighten electoral roll registration<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@casawolf @cktwitta @ian_adkin @Kel70824886 @catherinemginn Prob right. Was talking with a friend, said S'land has pop of 87k,  when consider 27k direct and indirect worker are linked to Nissan in the area (just under third), and they voted 62% leave  (nearly 2 thirds) it kinda makes sense. Very simplistic but it fits with your theory<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What an idiot @Nigel_Farage is?🥴 Instead of winding #Remainers up, he's mobilising us EVEN MORE for #PeoplesVote march on 19th!😂 There's gonna be some many Union Jacks alongside EU flag, ol' shouty-shouty's wobble chops will explode😂  #Brexit #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WarmongerHodges @CoolioDealio @TheMendozaWoman See, that's prob with you guys, always take it too far, rather than sensible convo🙄 yes, majority was cut at GE but mainly due to Remain vote (which won't be there next time) &amp; also, he still didn't win GE. Remind me, How many votes were won whilst May was in charge?🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoolioDealio @TheMendozaWoman @WarmongerHodges So with the increase in the total vote, did he win the GE🤔 Must have missed that 🤦🏻‍♂️ Or did Tory rebels vote with oppo, or against their leader, allowing oppo (which is not just JC) to win🤔 If anybody is twisting reality I'd say it's one of us, and it ain't me  #delusional<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>FAO @mehdirhasan  Please highlight this, especially across the pond. Sadly my voice isn't as loud as yours. Sickening but this is what happens when Trump enables Turkey.  Something has to be done to stop this .madness #TrumpGenocide #KurdsBetrayed #SundayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where's our foreign secretary @DominicRaab?!?🤬 Cold blooded execution of unarmed female Syrian politician by Turkish backed forces, &amp; then congratulated on twitter by state backed media. WT?!?🤬 #SundayThoughts  #TrumpGenocide #KurdsBetrayed #Turkey #Syrian<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMendozaWoman @WarmongerHodges Instead of tickling each other's tummys, I'd be seriously asking why JC / Labour STILL behind sh*ttiest Tory govt of all time in all polls. Doesn't that concern you? Constantly blaming media bias is just deflection from your weaknesses &amp; inability to connect to maj of population<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMendozaWoman @WarmongerHodges And what's that achieved??🙄 In case didn't notice, Tories STILL in Govt whilst he's presided over losing virtually every election Lab contested under his L/ship. If losing or being opposition forever floats your boat, cool. Cause way it is, can't see him winning anytime soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SIChrisMannix Price?? Seriously🤨 Come on Chris, I love Pricey's heart but Usyk waaay above that level!😂 At best, he'd be height sparring for a Fury fight. Agree Parker would be a great match up. Chisora / Takam too, be good for punch resistance training  #UsykWitherspoon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevESPNKim Right now, I'd say he'd do most of top 10 With Ruiz, would box him into submission. With AJ / Wilder it'd be in &amp; out, non stop rat-a-tat-tat Vs their one punch power. Can they catch him. Against Fury, be even. Usyk would be in &amp; out, Tyson looking for counters #UsykWitherspoon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevESPNKim Well he's trained with Wlad Klitschko for years so I don't see that as an issue. His foot movement is the key<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#StopBrexit Genuine question.  Those who keep using 17.4m, Can you categorically say figure is true today &amp; all who voted leave then, would do same now?

<|startoftext|>@MichaelPDeacon So it's confirmed. It's not about getting into power, it's about keeping everyone else out!🙄🤦🏻‍♂️ What happened to trying to make a difference??🤨 Just shows mentality.

<|startoftext|>Simply put, #ToriesAreScum   #StopBrexit #RevokeArticle50<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarieAnnUK Exactly. Sick to death of it🙄 Especially that AT LEAST half a mil of them have died (old age) and many hundreds of thousands (maybe millions) have changed their mind, so the figure doesn't even count. But they're stuck in a time machine<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PeterStefanovi2 Those police officers must feel like a right set of hard nuts 🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#StopBrexit #FBPE Can never imagine @jeremycorbyn speaking like this. QC by trade, @Keir_Starmer speaks clearly &amp; concisely to Johnson's reckless Govt, as opposed to protester's shouty voice of Corbyn🙄  And that's why @UKLabour all over place in polls. Change needed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcusJBall Truly gutted for you😏 No matter what court says, most of sense know BJ lied. even admitted it to @tombradby of @itvnews on bus during Ref campaign!

<|startoftext|>Yesterday's Prorogation - 5 days, 34 before - proves beyond any doubt .@BorisJohnson's last one was a complete sham. Nothing to do with new Parl etc. Was all about shutting down scrutiny of his #Brexit policy. Otherwise, why not have 5 in 1st place?🤔 #WednesdayThoughts #FBPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent assessment by @Keir_Starmer 👍🏼👏🏼 When will he be leader?  #Brexit #StopBrexit #FBPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit #FBPE Blindingly obvious to everyone bar Labour what needs to happen. It's not working, it's not been working for 2yrs. He's lost every election taken part in.

<|startoftext|>And before you do, don't dare blame media. What, ALL of them?? Do me a favour 🙄 And @jeremycorbyn's approval ratings??🤔 WORST of any opposition leader EVER. How p*ss poor have you got to be to be behind that #FilthyPieceOfToeRag Johnson 🤨🤦🏻‍♂️  Unbelievable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@UKLabour - A very simple question.  Do you look at polls or are your heads buried in mud on the banks of the Thames?? NONE have Labour ANYWHERE NEAR Johnson's sh*t-shower Tories, some even 3rd! Please explain  HOW TF that can be, &amp; WHY??? #Brexit #StopBrexit #Labour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit #RevokeA50 A pause for thought needed - from a Leaver. I applaud your honesty sir 👍🏼 Brexit morphing into something absolutely batsh*t-crazy, far from anything that was even suggested during campaign. Time for sense to re-emerge. Revoke, Remain, Rethink. #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews  @isaby is on Dominic Cummings memo repeat mode🙄 Absolutely pathetic blame game. keeps saying 17.4m, do you know how many have changed their minds? And what about other 49m? Also, more people voted in '92 GE than Referendum🤦🏻‍♂️  #StopBrexit #RevokeA50 #TuesdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IainDale Oh dear 🙄 3yrs of your Tories doing 'negotiations' with all it's brain boxes &amp; this is best can come up with...blame EU??🤦🏻‍♂️🤬 Pathetic Iain, just like Johnson.

<|startoftext|>@cabinetofficeuk 'Need to meet'? Are you taking mick .@BorisJohnson ??  Be honest. admit you're doing this for you, your mates &amp; their mates' mates to get absolutely loaded.

Once Brexit sorted, THEN have GE &amp; win outright, IF good enough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeftieK13 @hermitdave @MissEllieMae Issue isn't LDs, it's others, who'll never vote for JC whereas would for another senior Lab figure. don't see prob with Harman, Beckett or milliband being temp leader of GNU.

<|startoftext|>@Adam_SH69 Yes, but What I want to know is why would a company losing close to a million, keep getting grants / favours?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😢 Is this first confirmed death BECAUSE OF #Brexit ? Brexidiots @Nigel_Farage @BorisJohnson , ERG &amp; BP have a lot to answer for. I hope I'm wrong but seems first of what's to come  #FilthyPieceOfToeRag #mondaythoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do these people, Johnson, Trump etc think they can consistently take the piss and nothing will happen?  I think it's about time one of them, maybe both, were given a dose of reality that everyone else faces for breaking the law and brought down to earth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickyMorgan01 Get brexit done?? Stop lying FGS🤬 you know FOR A FACT #Brexit is not done on 31st, as there will years of uncertainty around trying to get long term deal with EU or start from scratch in case of NDB. Either way, by saying GBD, you're lying, plain &amp; simple  #FilthyPieceOfToeRag<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrHickmott I said something akin-ish   https://t.co/OWbJF0wA36<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Putting aside clear conflict of interest, Are there no morals left? Does being married not mean anything? How does explain playing home &amp; away to his kids?

<|startoftext|>#FilthyPieceOfToeRag why does a married man with 4 kids at the time, visit a blonde 20yrs his junior AT HER FLAT, during a working day, when he's Mayor of one of busiest cities in world?

<|startoftext|>.@GMB Just had a thought. Did #JenniferArcuri just drop @BorisJohnson in it -  deliberately.  A woman scorned an all that🤔 By not denying the affair &amp; subsequent grants received as a result, she's actually weaponised it more.  #LiarJohnson #JohnsonFail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@gmb WT🧐 Acuri's company was doing SO WELL it lost million quid, and yet, mysteriously kept on getting grants 🤔 Which basically says that either awarding body are dumbest so an so's with no due diligence, or, it WAS Boris pulling strings #LiarJohnson #JenniferArcuri<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trying to bamboozle @piersmorgan &amp; @susannareid100 who tbf, are sticking at it. Just can't stop laughing at her 'my tech' as if she's some Steve Jobs😂  And yet her company's not making money but keeps getting grants🤔😂  It's clear. We know.  #LiarJohnson #JenniferArcuri  @GMB<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>.@BorisJohnson  is a #FilthyPieceOfToeRag  As pronounced by one of his own constituents. The end.  #SundayThoughts #FBPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That ex &amp; current Tories would probably vote for Harman or Beckett as leader in GNU says everything about current leadership. They have no uniting ability. Take blinkers off &amp; let this happen @jeremycorbyn  You'll be part of it and If you do, it may just work in your favour in GE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SundayThoughts @UKLabour is the problem. Blaming @LibDems is futile. The LP can't get numbers required from across the house (ex Tories &amp; Current ones) in VoNC, NOT just same side of house. The quicker they understand this, the better it will be for the country.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RCorbettMEP Richard, think you're an honourable man but not having proper vote (show of hands?!) on biggest issue in politics was extraordinarily amateurish by party (corrupt?)

<|startoftext|>@StephenOld We can only hope &amp; pray 🤲🏼🙏🏼 A half decent centrist from LP &amp; they win GE. This is what JC &amp; Co don't get. need centre votes to win GE.

<|startoftext|>@MrHickmott Good point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrexitBin I was thinking same last night. Now he's adopted this neutral position but not fooling us again.

<|startoftext|>@CiaraMcMillan4 Blair's biggest problem was backing Bush, and the fallout after. But the country was doing great all on the back of a positive message as you say.

<|startoftext|>Watching #LabourConference, all talk about abolishing private schools, free prescriptions in Eng, final say Ref, Leave or Remain, etc etc. all rely on one thing - Winning a GE.

<|startoftext|>@alunprice667 @Jamin2g @uk_rants Not sure what problem was?🤨 She was just telling him what Lansmans had put up on his twitter account, and he was calling her a liar! 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a Tw*t!! If someone directs arrogant  .@LenMcCluskey to Lansmans twitter account, he'll see who's lying. Good for holding your ground  .@BethRigby 👍🏼👏🏼  #Lab19 #Labour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#LabourConference Biggest policy decision in years, potentially GE winning /losing.  Labour:  We support democracy  Also Labour: let's just use a show of hands, instead of a proper democratic individual vote  🤨🙄🤦🏻‍♂️  Not Corrupt much  #stitchup #Lab19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When .@Jacob_Rees_Mogg is supporting / thanking  you .@jeremycorbyn , thats when you know you've really messed things up  #Lab19 #Labour #LabourConference<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HackneyAbbott @jeremycorbyn @UKLabour How's the private school Hypocrisy coming along? 🤦🏻‍♂️ #Lab19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks to .@LenMcCluskey Tory HQ are laughing their heads off &amp; decided to cut back GE campaign budget.  Why spend so much when you have the opposition doing the work for you?🤔🤷🏻‍♂️  #Lab19 #Labour #FBPE #Labourconference19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right now, Leave voters living in  EU look like a right bunch of idiots 🤦🏻‍♂️ I'd like to say 'serves em right' but sadly it affects everybody, not JUST them🙄 Hopefully this may jolt a few into corrective action #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Basically Tory Govt just stuck 2 fingers up at all Brits abroad, especially ones who came back and voted Leave. Idiots aborad 🙄 I hope for all those in EU who didn't vote Leave' sake that it doesn't come to pass. #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Piers every time @GaryLineker tweets better than him  https://t.co/4GLVZyqKsu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today just confirmed what most polls show. Barring catastrophe from Johnson's Tories or scandal, Labour will not win GE, esp now as will lose majority of Remain vote. This day will be remembered as day that could have changed history. Idiots🙄🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤬  #Lab19 #Labour #FBPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidLammy Sorry mate but your leaders have lost their minds 🤦🏻‍♂️🤬 Neutral??🤬<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tnewtondunn You mean like BJ should be personally held responsible for saying NHS will get £350m a week, like that? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JolyonMaugham @talkRADIO @JuliaHB1 Her centre of attention knows no bounds🙄 How would Julia like it if someone put her home address/es up? As she's a well known public figure &amp; quite happy to dish it, sure she won't mind her family being in fear, just as she's made Jo's &amp; probably many others.  #mondaythoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theocrowshaw @BoskyJim @Independent In principle that's right. But when you're talking about an organisation so big with so many jobs on the line, seems perfectly reasonable for govt to help with guarantees attached. Now using £600m of tax payers money to repatriate everyone, which makes a whole load of sense🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theocrowshaw @Independent Good??🤨 Try tell that to 21k staff who are out of job this morning with mortgages, bills etc to pay. Having been there, one of worst feelings ever.  Clearly not lived 🙄 Govt help &amp; pay back when profitable, as banks did, wasn't unreasonable #ThomasCookcollapse #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_HighThunder_ @AP 👏🏼👍🏼😉😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KayBurley @HackneyAbbott @jeremycorbyn Good one Kay 😉  Staggering Hypocrisy by .@HackneyAbbott   The line that makes me shake my head is 'that was then'🙄🤦🏻‍♂️  She's used the privileges and now no longer needs them, hence will abolish them for the next gen. Why? Why's it different now?  Pathetic #Lab19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brianivy3 @LenMcCluskey It's McCluskey's way or F off. Not very democratic  https://t.co/wcWj68gl1M  https://t.co/gxdinNXp9F<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SundayThoughts Govt bailed out Banks, Rail contracts with billions, spent £8bn on ND Brexit, SURELY could help Thomas Cook with £200m &amp; save 21k jobs &amp; 160k holiday goers? Or they let company fold, lose those jobs &amp; instead spend £600m getting everyone back 🤔 Not rocket science<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tesdaburys @bilbocroft @KathRidout @JenniferMerode @StevePeers @BrexitAlex Curious🤔 So 1. 600 MEPs are stupid &amp; reason BXP didn't vote cause pointless resolution so why bother?   Or 2. abstained to say here (to get paid) but not taking part in any EU votes? I mean, we're only talking about a BRITISH CITIZEN, In jail, in Iran🤷🏻‍♂️  Either way its pathetic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably both 😉 #SupremeCourt #LiarJohnson #ThursdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HungLee 😂 And I was in SAS!!😜<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I saw this. Francois was Disgraceful. How he's an MP I'll never know. A Charlatan Shyster. Would love to have 10mins with him in an interview. He'd walk out crying  #thursdaymorning #FBPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Otto_English Laura's was told to distract away from the incident which was hugely embarrassing for #LiarJohnson 1. Make it about the father. Put it down to red on blue. Tories will love that.  2. The fact that Johnson lied - AGAIN - on camera  Distract, change the focus #ThursdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCPolitics So what?? one thing has nothing to do with other. More importantly is What about PM lying to his face??🤬  Did man slip someone a tenner or did he fake his 1 week old daughters illness to be there??  Disgraceful behaviour by BBC  #sacklaurakuenssberg #SackKuenssberg #LiarJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's just .@BorisJohnson was massively humiliated and got @bbclaurak to unleash hell on this poor guy.  Tory dirty politics enacted by tax payer employees of BBC  #SackKuenssberg #sacklaurakuenssberg  #FBPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thing don't get about BJ hospital incident &amp; .@bbclaurak tweeting OS a Labour activist.  Main q is How was he there?  Did he bribe someone or fake his 1 WEEK OLD DAUGHTERS illness?? I'm guessing neither🙄 Right time, right place to collar #LiarJohnson #sacklaurakuenssberg #FBPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lisamboo @BarrySheerman @JamesMelville @bbclaurak 👍🏼  although I'd disagree that she doesn't know how to use Twitter.  She knows.  That's why she did it. Her paymasters bidding. Take the attention away from Johnson by making it a party lines thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesMelville @paperbhoy Crass mistake?🤨 C'mon James, wakey wakey, more like 'deliberate attempt' Agreed people are impulsive &amp; inadvertent it happens, but this, and how it all unfolded? No way. She knew what she was doing, and why. With 1m plus followers, it was a dog whistle tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching @Peston  What's t**t Mark Francois is? Talking utter bollocks, 17.4m (half a mil have died!) and then to top it off, tries hijacking  .@SamGyimah interview. Good on you Sam for not having it ✌🏼  #SackKuenssberg #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watched Johnson hospital incident on @BBCNews sky 503. Why is presenter saying man 'OS, A Labour activist'.

<|startoftext|>Wonder what the headlines would have been today if #JeremyCorbyn had done yesterday what #BorisJohnson did? I'm gonna guess not favourable🤔  #ChickenJohnson #FBPE #IncredibleSulk #TuesdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Red on Yellow &amp; vice versa  needs to stop!🤬 Grow up, change this insult politics mentality🙄 Johnson's Tory-Nazi hybrid is prob.

<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1  https://t.co/W5ObiWs8yX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching it again, don't think #BorisJohnson was just scared of protesters. I think he knew what #LuxembourgPM was going to say at podium, as prob did in private. Simply put, BJ didn't have the B*ll*cks to face him or protesters. Cowardly #ChickenJohnson #FBPE #TuesdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbclaurak I heard the Luxembourg PM quite alright tbh, no crowd interference🤷🏻‍♂️ Sounds like a Load of Johnson BS to me   #ChickenBoris #ChickenShitJohnson<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jaypea_JP @BorisJohnson 😂 What good work?🤨🤦🏻‍♂️ Breaking Law &amp; Lying with Vote Leave, now under Police invgt? Lying to Queen &amp; Parliament?

<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Dearly me🙄 You're happy to proceed with result 1. Proven to have broken Law by Leave, AND crucially, still under investigation by Met Police &amp; NCA, but not yet concluded 2. In which over 500k, up to 1m elderly who voted leave, are no longer alive.  Brexidiot logic  #StopTheCoup<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Lotto688Lotto @bartleb @uk_domain_names because isn't one🙄 What Ref did was allow xenophobic feelings to surface, when Leave used take control of borders.Immigration is prob no.1 thing. Moderates realised that what was promised - same, but outside, doesn't exist/lies, so want to remain. NDB's are still using borders🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharlotDearling @JGForsyth My thoughts exactly. Seems he's doing an inside job, and I'd go as far as saying even Johnson maybe losing control of him.

<|startoftext|>Boom! The Truth. Cummings is a school bully. I've had a conservation with few in my time. Usually turns out their chicken shits. He will get his soon, hopefully by the Met  #StopBrexit #StopTheCoup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Otto_English Ditto to that😂 Every time the word #Brexit gets said, everyone takes cover, even though it may be literally nothing 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesMelville @kennett_kate Great response 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JMPSimor Dictatorship. Or that Brexidiot Cummings is actually trying to DESTROY the Tory party, as well the parliament.  Let's see how many have a backbone. None of the cabinet by looks of it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BBC aka Brexit Broadcasting Corporation, is as impartial on #Brexit as Gary Neville  .@GNev2 is on reffing Man U game!  Tom 'I'm hard' Harwood is no Brexpert, more Brexshit. It's just his Sugar Daddy pays well &amp; has connections  #StopBrexit #StopTheCoup<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JolyonMaugham @BorisJohnson Personally Jo, I think anyone who's taken the oath to be an MP, and more so as PM, and then uses headed paper of parliament to misrepresent what he's REALLY doing - it's more than enough IMO 🤷🏻‍♂️  It goes back to other case, of politicians lying in public duty, like 350m a week BS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnnyTooTall @dotdotdot17345 @piersmorgan @GMB @GaryLineker Well, well, well, Uncle Charlie you say 🤔 Now wouldn't it be great if @RealNatalieRowe had a take on that 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you for this info Jackie 👍🏼 I posted a tweet yesterday about 'many' expats voting leave and now will suffer. I would like to correct that. Some. Those who voted remain, I am truly sorry for the anxiety you're going through. #StopTheCoup #Remain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LianePougy @Haggis_UK ✌🏼 I remember when brexit party launched, many came over from Spain to support fart face. I was like 'Huh? Talk about shooting yourself in foot!🤦🏻‍♂️ Obvs many couldn't vote due to 15yr rule which is also why Leave won IMO. Sad state. BJ doesn't give shit about expats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveBarclay I'll keep it simple. No deal = trucks grind to halt = no parts in time. Leave With a deal = pretty much carry on as is for 2yrs.  What was your Job title again??  #BlockTheCoup #StopTheCoup<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chilternbear @campbellclaret @BorisJohnson Wrong🙄  500k upwards, close to 1m elderly leave voters died since Ref, so 17.4m no longer applies. Those who are not alive/result won't affect still counted, yet 16,17yr olds who ARE but couldn't vote, and ones will affect for life, can't do anything?🤔  Brexidiot logic 🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 @MikeGapes @ForChange_Now @Anna_Soubry 🙄  Not a Mike fan But Perspective. What about the guy (JC) who vociferously wanted out of EU for 31yrs suddenly woke up one day and changed his mind to remain, then day after Ref result, wanted A50 triggered without a clue of What, How &amp; when, and been chasing shadows since.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IainDale Likewise, What about 48m? Who's representing them right now in Govt?  Man who won by 5k votes in Uxbridge, voted for by 90k Tory members, who happen to be majority over 60, wealthy &amp; want brexit agree should be rep'd from across board but don't use 17.4m argument, it's desperate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, get Dominic Grieve as interim AG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Harriet Harman as interim PM with Uncle Ken as Chancellor (done before) with all heads of party's on board too (ex BJ), for 6 to 12mths. Balance the ship, sort Brexit - revoke or extend to allow Ref with facts for ND v Remain, then set GE  #Brexit #NationalUnityGovt  #RevokeA50<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>National Unity Govt, middle word being key. So how's attacking each other, mainly JC followers to JS/ Libdems, Unity?  Guys/Gals, need to stop this childish behaviour and start thinking how to stop this looming disaster TOGETHER  #FridayFeeling #Brexit #NationalUnityGovt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrHickmott Also, national unity Govt must push Met Police &amp; NCA to finalise their investigations on any criminal intent during ref by VL &amp; LEU We cannot carry on like this. Our current PM was involved, as was deputy PM Gove, and PM's advisor. It seems like a massive coverup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrHickmott My take? national unity govt shouldn't be lead by a leader of party. should be senior figure such as Ken Clarke, Harriet Harman, someone who commands respect of HoC. Sort brexit (min 6mths, poss 12) set date for GE next year, then let JC, BJ etc slug it out<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LeaveEUOfficial 3yrs ago, after tests by Docs, you were diagnosed with illness. Since then, no treatment been given. Now, you want to start treatment based on that same diagnosis.

<|startoftext|>@HardingMike Well done Mike,👏🏼👍🏼 and at same time, sorry you had to.  This what Corbyn pups such as .@TheMendozaWoman do when they slag off people. Lose their members/votes = won't win GE.  Simple maths. all 5 been Labour members longer than she's been on this planet!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMendozaWoman Aaaaahhhh, so THIS is how you go about Uniting the country!🙄😂 Honestly one of most ridiculous tweets I've seen, &amp; trust me, since idiot Johnson been in, there's been many How on earth you expect your dear leader to win majority of votes at GE when he's got disciples like you🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Leiton_eous @MichelleDewbs @BorisJohnson Yes, that's right, everyone works in two of the biggest banks, Why wouldn't we know that🙄🤦🏻‍♂️  Having a war room is quite different to having / saying a war cabinet.

<|startoftext|>This is what No deal will actually look like. But I suppose if you're a little Englander who doesn't leave the country, why would it bother you? Only when food supplies run short... #Brexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MichelleDewbs @BorisJohnson Johnson, Gove etc are serial Liars &amp; Hypocrites. Proven.  What annoys is faux celebs who won't / don't call it out - a spade is a spade.

<|startoftext|>@MichelleDewbs @BorisJohnson Hysterical nonsense?😂 1. You realise when term was last used by PM? When we were at war!🙄 2. It's a deliberate play to appease hard right &amp; ready country for civil disobedience (Why 20k extra police?)  Also, not encountered ONCE, in 30yrs??🙄😂 Seems I'm not alone by replies 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No one, esp those in new cabinet, incl PM himself, voted for or even proclaimed at Referendum we'd have no deal brexit. Not One Of Them. It's complete bollocks what they're saying &amp; trying to force upon us. Don't let them. Resist #Brexit #StopBrexit #NotoNoDeal #RejectNoDeal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichelleDewbs @BorisJohnson er, sorry that's BS! I've been in business/ businesses for 30yrs (SME to nat level) &amp; NEVER heard war cabinet being said, even when we rolling out national project for 3k staff over 6 weeks.

<|startoftext|>@aigillies75 @Muralista @TomLondon6 @TheMendozaWoman Any powerful people movement wins regardless of who's trying to stop it. Plenty of historical world examples. Just sounds like team Corbyn and co are not up to it. You guys have more resources now than ever and yet are losing members daily. Why is that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomLondon6 Not again 🤦🏻‍♂️ I like a lot of your views but comparing Corbyn to  Mandela (Jail for 27yrs)  Gandhi ( Independence / hunger strike /assassinated) or King (assassinated for African American rights) is honestly embarrassing.  His means well but is not a martyr. Those 3 are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bmarks45btinter @TomLondon6 @LeckyBillK Not true re majority. I was JC last GE, now doesn't have me or other 11 family members who were. At a party Sat, 10 adults, 9 voted Lab last time. Not now. All BC of him. Polls show same. Without JC, Lab win. Doesn't mean hate him or ideas, doesn't have MASS appeal to win a GE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Hypocrisy of the Day (so far)  Cameron spends £9m tax payers money outlining pros- cons of Remain/Leave. BJ says wrong for PM to use public funds.

<|startoftext|>@TomLondon6 Yes those in power / right wing media are doing what you say but those 3 were martyrs for their cause. Corbyn is not fit to lace their shoes! If JC donated his Hoc £1.5m pension pot or whatever it is built up over 36yrs in HoC to good cause /charity, then that's a start<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomLondon6 You're seriously comparing those 3 Legends with JC? Did he spend 27yrs in JAIL? Go on HUNGER STRIKE, give up his CAREER/SALARY for his cause?

Lab didn't/can't win because JC can't win centre, C-left and C-right vote. Without them, he's got nothing. Fact<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gimmethegummi @NiceEtoile @TomLondon6 Destroyed?🤦🏻‍♂️Is that what you call losing GE?😂 up against Theresa maybot, he had youth, massive social media momentum, even little old me on side, but STILL couldn't win.  Don't kid yourself, only reason WA didnt pass is Tory ERG &amp; DUP scuppered it, not because of Lab<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesMelville I remember watching this originally. Some northern town, not Barnsley, but similar. Absolute xenophobic loons, lot of them. Notice how most of a certain age.

<|startoftext|>@Channel4News @PGMcNamara Exactly what Theresa May said a month, a week and then a few days before announcing one. It is inevitable. Scary part? Labour will get smashed. don't want them to, just don't think they're up to it.  and then what happens after will be much much worse for country<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vitt2tsnoc @Jeezoh1 And his national / general public record is abysmal  4 years 3 elections (GE, Locals, Euros)  3 lost (4 if you include Referendum)  Not a good look<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CllrJonSHarvey Wait, what?🤨 Or another way of looking at it, In 4 years, JC has done naff all, apart from look shite against worst Tory PM &amp; Govt (soon to be overtaken) as well as lose every election he's been involved in, 4 at last count. Maybe rethink the blame everyone else strategy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>🙄 .@BorisJohnson thinks we're stupid 'Promised' to have 20k police asap, yet in last 9yrs, Tories have CUT police force by 20k (maybe more) So essentially he's only looking to take back to 2010 level when Labour were in Govt 🤦🏻‍♂️ Pathetic #Brexit #JokePM #NotMyPrimeMinister<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NiceEtoile @gimmethegummi @TomLondon6 😂👏🏼👍🏼🤣 You first answer was right. He's not a good leader. It's quite something that so many people can't see it.  What has he won or achieved as leader, against worst Tory PM &amp; Govt ever??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mirkasher31 @TomLondon6 @LondonnurseT Sorry, he is not a good leader.  Lost last 3 elections (GE, Locals, Euros), 4 if you include Referendum. What kind of record is that? Labour Policy is good generally but clearly he cannot convince general public, who he needs to do anything. That's the problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomLondon6 @Fixed_that_4_U I don't disagree he's a good man &amp; has good ideas re policy, but something not right. Why? been in charge 4yrs, honestly, what has he achieved or won in that time? Lost GE, locals &amp; Euros. either not a leader, has incompetent people advising against worst Tories ever, or both!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScouseGirlMedia @JaneJac54550719 @Lpool_Pics_2013 @jeremycorbyn WE'RE talking Nonsense??🤨 Irony on speed!😂 He's the one who's promised this, that and the other for FOUR YEARS and what does he have to show for it???

<|startoftext|>@ScouseGirlMedia @Fixed_that_4_U @jeremycorbyn 1. Heard it all before in last 4 years🙄 JC can say any amount he wants, totally irrelevant as not won. 2. Based on last 3 elections (GE, Locals, Euros) &amp; all recent polls, not going to either 3. See 1 &amp; 2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheMendozaWoman The far left have not, in my lifetime, won. ever. The only thing I know is Labour won in 97 and then another 2 times.

<|startoftext|>@SethAbramson Yes &amp; No 92k party members (out of 160) clearly do, as do over half of Tory MPs. 1/3 of party don't &amp; 45% of MPs don't. he's all bluster &amp; bullshit, no detail (sound familiar?) &amp; one of main reasons we're in this divided society is cause he lead Leave side in Referendum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trussliz @BorisJohnson Seriously Liz?? What mandate? By who? 92k Tories plus 23k in Uxbridge don't represent a mandate for the whole country, to do whatever you want. Talk about shining a turd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boris wins Tory internal election and is lined up to be PM Tomorrow (unless the Queen says non) First thing he has to deal with? Only the DUP asking for another bung to keep their votes. How much this time, £2bn??  #NotMyPM #NotMyPrimeMinister #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boris was born in USA and was a dual US / UK citizen until 2016. Technically he could have run for President. If only he had🙄  #NotMyPM #NotMyPrimeMinister #NextPrimeMinister   https://t.co/hXGDCy3Wou<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#NextPrimeMinister #BorisDay I blame the 23000 in Uxbridge &amp; Ruislip who voted for Boris. It's primarily on them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@allisonpearson Boris Johnson and impressive are not words that should EVER be in the same sentence😂  Some people (AP) have truly taken leave (no pun intended) of their senses. He is a Shyster and a Charlatan, at best. If that's impressive, more fool you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@silverslideman V true, I know what you mean. He's one those that'll say whatever he needs to to get whatever he needs to. Last 4 weeks plus today, he's all No deal bluster. Reality will hit v soon when he can't do it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NextPrimeMinister #BorisDay  Anyone else see report from @metpoliceuk &amp; @NCA_UK regarding criminality of VoteLeave, of which @BorisJohnson was one of leaders, &amp; LeaveEU, of which @Nigel_Farage was too?  No, me neither🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HackneyAbbott @joswinson @BBCr4today @UKLabour @jeremycorbyn How many elections has Jeremy won? Lost GE, lost Locals, Lost Euros,  how many is it gonna take to see the obvious? Tories changed after one! He may be a good man, have some decent ideas but he can't win. Sooner you accept that &amp; change, better it will be for everyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HackneyAbbott @joswinson @BBCr4today @UKLabour @jeremycorbyn Or maybe JC steps aside?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NextPrimeMinister  Now Tory shitshow is over, rules must change. If governing party change their leader, whether Cons, Lab, LDs or whoever, must be General election. Cause right now it's 23k in Uxbridge &amp; 92k Tory members who have essentially selected next PM, out of 67 million<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WBothering @geoghegan68 Don't forget Katie Shitkins and Nigel Wobby chops  These are what we're up against<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deeplyclassical Probably 😂 But as of now, on paper, they cant say that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NextPrimeMinister #BorisDay  Boris's election win should be a an inspiration to everyone. A man who can lie, get sacked, lie, get sacked, bumble, bluster, get sacked, lie more AND STILL get the best job in his field🤯  #Brexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#BorisDay  Wow. double the votes what Hunt got. Some seriously crazy people in Tory party. Mind you, it's like choosing between do you want to be punched in the nuts or hammer to your fingers. #Brexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lynnesandgate @HilaryBurrage Yes, if worst happened, for a short time but then I live in hope that it is only a short time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kevin_Maguire Kevin, nearly Always agree with alot of what you say but this is petty &amp; Pathetic. Need to be better and rise above, not same old same old. For Labour to do anything, they need to get their own house in order. Is it? No  Better stay quiet then. At least LD own their shit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@montie @Telegraph And when the shit hits the fan, will you own that too, or look for excuses as per usual?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Peston is right. After today, not one #Brexidiot can moan about a remain PM or why Brexit has / hasn't happened. From now, it's all their own doing. And they will pay  #heatwave #Boris #TuesdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Waking up to find so many attacks on @joswinson from @UKLabour and it's puppy attack dogs, it's actually quite telling. Scared?  #TuesdayThoughts #StopBrexit #JoSwinson #LibDemLeadership<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyoCaesar Ash, difference is Others made mistakes, owned them &amp; want to change. Unlike JC who will never admit he's made a mistake. Ever. Seems ok when JC changes his mind (against EU for 40yrs!? then suddenly he's remain) but someone else does it? they're untrustworthy #Hypocrisy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's hear what old Wobbly chops @Nigel_Farage has to say about his mate Trump dumping us, and we've turned to and received support from the very people he keeps slagging off - The EU.  #Brexit #Iran #TankerCrisis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey .@UKLabour  In the interests of transparency, can you provide ia list of all the members who have resigned and left the party since the turn of the year. And if possible, what was their primary reason for doing so. TiA #LabourParty #heatwaveuk  #Brexit #mondaythoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimonBruni @sazmeister88 @UKLabour Nail on the head 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UKLabour Embarrassing &amp; petty. But as norm now, wrong target🤦🏻‍♂️ You lot should be readying your attack for Boris &amp; ERG, Or Farage &amp; his bunch of bullshitters. Not seen attacks for him? Why is that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dontbrexitfixit @IainDale @LBC If ID is relying on Boris's charisma to get us through, we are truly screwed. The fact he lied In front of Iain &amp; 4k Tories last week about the kipper story is all you need to know about his charisma. A lie is still a lie, regardless how it's told.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cirian75 @UKLabour Because the threat at the GE is from the Libs, so the attacks have started<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even though many prob voted leave, they did so in the hope of a sensible managed Brexit, not this chaotic mess the Tories have and are unleashing.  My guess? not one of them wanted No Deal. They could literally bring the capital to a standstill<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At what point after Boris becomes PM are we going to see a load of farmers from all over UK head to Downing Street with their livestock, combine harvesters and tractors, a la french protest style?

<|startoftext|>@ajmpolite Deep Xenophobia? Racism? Jealousy? that someone comes from nowhere &amp; do well whilst you're doing naff all. It's like 70-80s in UK South Asian populus. My dad was an extremely successful businessman &amp; we'd get abused, even attacked for it. Now? hear same type of noises in #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darrengrimes_ @BBCr4today Win? You means stupidity is a defense now?  You merely showed the court for what you really are - dumb - for not being able to fill a form in, and they believed you.  I wouldn't call that a win. I'd call that a lucky relief. For now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NemoSisterOTM @ThatTimWalker @jeremycorbyn Yes, that maybe so but You have too look at this from the outside. Take yourself out of the ring. He doesn't seem to be able to build coalition. It's his way or no way. He should have been getting all opposition together, plus Tory rebels to defeat Govt. But he can't<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NemoSisterOTM @ThatTimWalker @jeremycorbyn like many of policies (not all) been talked about but just can't see how he can ever win centre left, centre &amp; centre right vote, which is what is required to become PM. Right will never vote for him, CR are struggling under a rw media onslaught &amp; centre / CL (me) he's losing too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NemoSisterOTM @ThatTimWalker @jeremycorbyn Appreciate that but struggling to see how he's healing divisions. Far from it.  Not a hater, was fan but last 18mths seen things which made me think he's prob not the one. Might be good man an all that but don't see it in him to be leader we need.  Happy to be wrong - in time😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NemoSisterOTM @ThatTimWalker @jeremycorbyn As a life long protester, you'd think he'd have been at the forefront, or deeply involved, trying to stop coming destruction of the right.  But for me, too Apathetic.  Every time there's been a march or whatever, he's elsewhere talking about things that happened decades ago.Why?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Notice how Boris, Hunt, Farage &amp; Co have started to blame EU, even before we've left.  But was not EU who: A. Held advisory Ref🧐 B. Openly Lied to public🤬 C. Can't decide in 3yrs🤦🏻‍♂️ D. Changed from will leave with deal to wanted ND all along🙄  SHYSTERS  #MondayMorning #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Feck_the_EU Your title is somewhat ironic   Can you tell us when the elections are for: A. brexit party leader B. WTO  (ps - Answer is same for both)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Feck_the_EU My answer to question is, If it were other way round, would you?  v m doubt it, just like Eurosceptics didn't for 40yrs.  If ND #brexit happens &amp; things many said can/will go wrong, DO go wrong, will you &amp; your ilk accept responsibility? Doubt it.  Will blame everyone else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patel4witham So what you're actually saying is current PM Theresa May, the one who gave you a ministerial job, DIDN'T believe in Britain??🤔  Talk about back stabbing &amp; arse licking, in the same sentence! Disgraceful. Who needs enemies when you have friends like you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@andreajenkyns Must have missed it but where on the ballot paper did it say we will close down parliament to leave?🤔 Also, in case you forgot, referendum was advisory, as in NOT mandatory, as in advise parliament, not force parliament. Stop lying and misleading<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan He didn't say his tweets about go back home were wrong though did he, and they (crowd) only followed on from what he said, so I don't understand the logic🤨 He, like you, just talk some proper BS and say what you think you need to at that moment<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nharmertaylor You're serious?? These 8 are part of the reason (Labour side) why we are where we are right now.

<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan If she's annoying, ditto how 80% of us feel about you.  Just admit it Piers, anyone who talks sense, is reasonable or says things about your sugar daddy Trump, you don't or won't like EVER, regardless of whether they're telling the truth or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kean1S @SheronWilkie True but guess who was foreign sec at time of some of the Amb emails 😉 And who conveniently printed them, Isabel Oakeshott, a Johnson / Farage ally<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ambassador has no choice but to resign when Boris fails to offer unreserved backing on tv last night. Today, Boris fanboys coming out saying he supports all British diplomats.

<|startoftext|>Sensitve, top secret diplomatic cables get leaked to a newspaper, sounds to me like @metpoliceuk need to investigate.

<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Desperately needs the USA, as opposed to the 40% trade we do with EU?   that sounds like an admission brexit is a sh*t show  Why don't you just renounce your citizenship now Piers, talking like a traitor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oflynnsocial The answer to your question of find the leaker is in your first sentence 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cirian75 @Doozy_45 Possibly?  Probably Simon. Should be an investigation into him and his associates. Funny how it's @IsabelOakeshott who got the leaks, lead groupie of Ashcroft, Farage, Banks and Boris fan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Read your statement again, but now imagine it was said by @jeremycorbyn, Tony Blair or even @campbellclaret. You'd be calling them Traitors. Hypocrisy much   #wednesdaythoughts #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Here he comes, Trumps paid agent in UK 🙄 The ambassador is literally doing his job telling it like it is over there.  What SHOULD be asking why / who leaked this, especially now as PM about to change🤬 But not surprised, coming from guy who printed fake news &amp; got sacked for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shameful😌 Whilst everyone tripping over Agent Boris(USA) for PM, these are the REAL issues.

<|startoftext|>The timing of Ambassador leaks🙄 Boris about to become PM, in 2017-18 was Foreign Sec, who would have access to this stuff. He's pally with Trump's boy Bannon, and Farage is piping up. Even a monkey can work it out #Brexit #TuesdayThoughts #justsaying<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealNatalieRowe @Femi_Sorry Interesting one Natalie, defo got peeps talking 😉😂 From what heard him say, he was born in Darlo (Darlington) so assume this makes him British.

<|startoftext|>@AgainstHunting @IrenePedPath @leftwingedduck @coldings123 @jeremycorbyn Believe what you like🙄 My FB still has a post from 2017 encouraging people to vote for him.  I feel extremely let down and now see through him. He's a career politician. 36yrs and achieved what? Nothing. You just backed up my point.  JC fans can't take criticism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thenitinsawhney So pls explain why a chunk of lefties on labour side are backing right wing agenda of Brexit? And don't say democracy.  Just don't.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IrenePedPath @leftwingedduck @AgainstHunting @coldings123 @jeremycorbyn loyalty is v important, but not when it's blind.  As I said early up, I was JC fan / supporter, and voted Lab at 2017 GE as a result. But since, seen many things in JC / front bench that make me think he's either not got 'it', wrong or both. Too many missed opportunities<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrenePedPath @leftwingedduck @AgainstHunting @coldings123 @jeremycorbyn Interesting reading these comments. Always, at some point, it gets personal 🙄 Do you guys not see the irony? EXACTLY what RW media want - Lab supporters at each other🤦🏻‍♂️ Devil's advocate. JC supporters, why can't you take any criticism of him. You know he's not always right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leftwingedduck @AgainstHunting @coldings123 @jeremycorbyn Maybe can't see it but can you name one thing he's achieved in 36yrs as an MP? I'm thinking like a CV.   In opposition or when Lab were in govt, what's his record of achievement? he's defo earnt a v good living and will have a great pension too. Not hatin, just statin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AgainstHunting @coldings123 @leftwingedduck @jeremycorbyn You misunderstood me. I agree propaganda against him, particularly personal, out of work stuff is wrong. Just wrong.  Anything to do with his policies  is fair enough. RW media will go for him, esp as he's never conformed. Just think last 2yrs not understood what needed to do<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JamesCleverly Said the privileged Tory 🙄 You are dumb if you actually believe this. Out there, in the REAL world of England, people of colour are abused DAILY. Fact. Honestly, you don't half come across like one of the characters in the Get Out movie🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IanLaveryMP @jeremycorbyn The attacks on JC looks are wrong.  The attacks on JC's policy choices or advisors, lack of clarity or leadership on many issues is right. Not by RW media but by normal everyday LP members who are frustrated that non elected people are dictating what's going on. That's not right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edwardpoole1975 This tweet is next level 🙄 Look around you.

<|startoftext|>@Otto_English Legally, yes. All takes is letter to EU. Think she should &amp; say new PM present case to country with  FACTS for deal, no deal &amp; remain. A graph / table.

<|startoftext|>@allisonpearson Desperate. support a man who has a conviction for assault on a woman, Or using/implying racist terms consistently over the years commentating and at dinners?  Not surprised tbh. Seems the norm nowadays for Boris / Brexit fan club members such as yourself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB @piersmorgan @susannareid100 Embarrassing🙄 GMB wheel out another Brexidiot, EX-CRICKETER! in his 70s to spout Jingoistic nonsense about war, things will fine with No deal.

<|startoftext|>@CarolineFlintMP CF loves Parliament gravy train🙄 It seems you're not up to speed. according to 99.99% of polls, people now for Remain by  clear majority (15%+) If you force brexit by backing Tories, bring chaos to nation, who's responsible, public, or you lot who should already know better?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3yrs after Referendum, the BS &amp; unicorn land talk continues🙄  I wake up to find Leave people STILL saying everything's gonna be alright, let's be positive, optimistic etc. Common Theme? Not one of them knows how  #Brexit #mondaythoughts #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage I think if you look again on twitter, you'll probably see that 17.4m has dramatically changed - downwards. So many ex leave voters are remainernow. Your 3 year fig is wrong.  Also, how's that EC enquiry into every donation going?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JamesCleverly What a stupid lying Tory🤦🏻‍♂️ When did they say it was a good idea?🙄 They were asked do you want to Leave or Remain. You're the idiots who now 'pretend' to know they said it's a good idea   What's with the constant BS?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Absolutely. Anyone in Tory leadership race has admitted to taking drugs, whether in office or before, they should not be allowed to stand as an MP nevermind run for PM. Can't have one rule for one, one for another.  However we're talking Tory party so🤷🏻‍♂️🙄 #Brexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GloriaDePiero Really?🤨 Prove it  The way carried on these last 3yrs would suggest some said one thing and did another, with the cover being 'democracy'🙄 Was it democracy when JC voted 600 odd times against his own party / whip in parl, when specifically instructed not too? Pitiful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WorldBoxingWall Er none of the above 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AranBailey @OwenJones84 rules say 'encourage &amp; support'. He didn't encourage, nor did he ask anyone else to support. he 'supported' by voting but he clearly explained why. Tactical. Incidentally, I voted LD but have voted Lab most my life. because of JC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AranBailey @OwenJones84 Also, why would JC congratulate a man who was standing against a Labour candidate? I know he's his old pal, but why do it publicly? Not a good example<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AranBailey @OwenJones84 When did .@campbellclaret say support #LibDems BEFORE? He just said who he voted for 3 days AFTER polling had closed. That's why whole thing seems vindictive. He never told anyone publicly, as far as I'm aware, to vote for them, just who he had after.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LeeFromSwindon @GloriaDePiero @IanLaveryMP Respect the result? 😂 You mean one that's been PROVEN to fraudulently obtained through data manipulation, overspending &amp; Lies?🤨😂 What Labour SHOULD have done is call for public enquiry into it.

<|startoftext|>@lisanandy 🤦🏻‍♂️Why are you in politics if you can't Take criticism, Hear an opposing view or Be prepared to answer questions rather than words like 'compromise' without solutions.

<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 @UKLabour Also, @campbellclaret didn't break the rules. He didn't declare or encourage support for another party pre-election. He said - 4 DAYS AFTER polling had closed who he voted for.  Not the same thing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomLondon6 Blairism you say? The thing that won 3 GEs? Maybe he did become a little power happy and was Bush's puppy over Iraq, but the country as whole was doing pretty well, incl me. Best time of my life.

<|startoftext|>@danmaclane @OwenJones84 😂🤣👍🏼 Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danmaclane @OwenJones84 Not once have I called you a name or abused you.   Still waiting to hear you tell me his achievements in HoC or I suppose that's more bs from me🙄😂  Of course, only JC fanboys know how LP policy works, us 30yr lab supporters wouldn't have a clue would we.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danmaclane @OwenJones84 He should consider his position. If any other leader of LP had gone on run he has, they'd be out. Ed resigned after one GE, even though did well at Locals. JC Lost 3 elections.  GE, Locals, Euro's. If JC 'decent man' why doesn't he do decent thing and resign?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danmaclane @OwenJones84 Decent man? you his counsellor!🙄😂🤦🏻‍♂️  Bonkers theory?😂 misled remainers, got 3m extra votes at GE &amp; they're now deserting him at Locals &amp; Euros. desperately back tracking, cagely saying will have option for public vote. Ask yourself, What's he scared of?  he WANTS brexit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danmaclane @OwenJones84 He's always been a protester, at best. Look how's he's changed last 3yrs. Navy suits, white shirt, red tie, trying to look all serious politician. Fake. When his appeal was his normalness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danmaclane @OwenJones84 I never said he's a bad person, not once, he's just not a leader<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danmaclane @OwenJones84 He'd be the biggest winner. Tories would be ruined as most of VL were ministers. Ask yourself, why hasn't he? Only 3 reasons poss 1. He / some of Lab were involved too 2. wants out, so ignoring calls 3. Wants Brexit to be Tories, county crashes,hopes to ride in on back of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danmaclane @OwenJones84 I'm one of those voters. believed him but he has done nothing in last 2yrs but show remain contempt. He's closet Leaver, hiding behind 'will of people' BS. What should have done is shout for a public enquiry into foreign interference &amp; proven fraud/cheating. But again, nothing🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danmaclane @OwenJones84 Anti-semitism thing, not him per se, but others. Why's he ignoring? 36yrs in HoC, been career politician on tidy salary. What's his achievements in that time?  Re GE, true but upsurge was remain voters who now feel duped. Unless he changes, that defo won't be there next time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lisanandy Sorry but watched you from 'The North' last 3yrs &amp; every time hear you, can't help think all hot air with no solution &amp; about keeping your safe seat. fawning concern for 'your constituents' but happy to advocate brexit which will decimate jobs, as well know from Gov reports🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danmaclane @OwenJones84 If everything is ok, why investigation by EHRC? Why can't Corbyn be wrong or at fault?🤔 Why this siege mentality?  If JC as good as you think, he'd have won last GE, whopped everyone in LE &amp; Euro's.  He didn't.  Clearly something is wrong / not working &amp; needs to change🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danmaclane @OwenJones84 😂 So anti-semitism is over?🤔 Could have sworn EHRC launched investigation today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 How stupid do #Labour look right now?🙄🤦🏻‍♂️ Got battered in EU Elections due to fence sitting, Farage taking mick out of them, Left hand doesn't know what right doing, Expelled AC for breach of rules when others aren't, Now under investigation by EHRC for anti-semitism  Not bad😨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 What about mighty leader supporting an independent against the actual Labour candidate? Shouldn't he be expelled?  https://t.co/rnUph3uI68<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danmaclane @OwenJones84 😂🤣 NEC? More like JEC!😂 It can't sort anti-Semitism in over 3.5yrs of him being leader, but can expel one of his enemies in 5 days?? Or suspends others (friends) indefinitely with enquiries taking place? It's literally one rule for his mates, another for rest. Embarrassing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danmaclane @OwenJones84 This stinks of Seamus Milne.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danmaclane @OwenJones84 Once or twice, 400 plus!!😂 That's basically saying FY. But did they get suspend / expel?   That's why it's petty, &amp; vindictive. Bigger fish to fry yet this is how they've stolen the headlines from Tories🙄 No idea what they're doing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right now, .@UKLabour look like a complete set of Muppets.   Talk about taking the narrative away from the Tories 🤦🏻‍♂️😂  #Brexit #Labour #TuesdayThoughts<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Florenceofarabi @campbellclaret @UKLabour C'mon, really? 🤨 Not looking for argument but this just stinks of pettiness &amp; Vendetta.  Granted AC no angel but what Lab L/ship done in last 2yrs? Nothing. Indecisiveness galore. And just look at EU results, lost against a fraudulent fascist. Can't blame Tories for that 🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree, a rebrand is needed.  If Leave can become The brexit party, Remain should become 'STAY IN EU'  #Brexit #EUelections2019  #StayInEU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MickMcAteer @BBCr4today Not saying agree with DA, just pointing out JC can't win unless he has centre. That's what TB, @campbellclaret &amp; Co were so good at, winning the centre. In comparison, when hear what comes out of Team JC, they look like league 2 team in Premier League Overawed &amp; outmanoeuvred<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MickMcAteer @BBCr4today Devil's advocate. When Corbyn &amp; Co actually win an election, can say what you want about DA, DM etc. Until then, just sounds like jealous tantrum towards team who were part of LP that WON 3 GE &amp; did well (excl Iraq) until worldwide economic crash, which cost them 2010 GE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ajmpolite Worse, they say half of 6 mil were fake🙄 If that's case, how can we be sure all votes for brexit party are legit, based on what @Old_Ben_Kay says🤔 What about the missing postal votes? What about the EU citizens who couldn't vote &amp; How many of them? #EuropeanElectionResults<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#EuropeanElectionResults Couple that with 1.5m+ who marched in London for Remain, as opposed to few thousand who did same for Leave, and hardly any around country, you have to ask yourself, what's JC waiting for??  There's an open goal waiting to be scored in. Fill your boots<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#EUelections2019 #Brexit  Here's one to help .@jeremycorbyn  More people signed #revokearticle50 petition (6.1m) than voted for #TheBrexitParty (5.2m) in EU elections or their petition combined. Fact.   Add the votes for remain parties, not hard to see who's got the majority<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GloriaDePiero @jeremycorbyn Same old record 🙄💤💤😴😴 You ain't winning anything based on last 3-4 weeks results.  Face up to it. You can't win unless you change your brexit position. That's the reality<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 #EUelections2019 #Brexit Wow, we agree again 👍🏼 😂 Remain clearly winning, all it needs is JC / AnOther to get off fence, choose Remain &amp; tell everyone why it's better IN than out. He'd win, we'd all win. Core prob is Lab leadership is anti-EU, NOT party.  Now party must act<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How stupid are folk??🙄🤦🏻‍♂️ #EUelections2019 #Brexit #EuropeanElectionResults<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikegalsworthy Quite right Mike. Someone has to accept or be made responsible for these EU results, as well as the locals,  rather than simply blaming the Tories, brexit etc. This was a Strategic choice. And who's in charge of that?  Heads must roll<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#EUelections2019 #EP2019 #bollockstobrexit The Brexit party = UkIP in a summer outfit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peston @Nigel_Farage Er not really, he's taken Ukip vote, which he was last time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some getting carried away with Brexit party results, when in actual fact, all they've done is taken the Ukip vote. Same-ish shit, different Rosette. Apart from that, Remain parties are smashin it 👏🏼👍🏼  #EUelections2019 #EP2019 #EuropeanElectionResults<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#EUelections2019 results  Make no mistake, Farage has predominantly taken Tory votes. Essentially brexit party are pissed of Ukipers, who were pissed off Tory voters, incl NF himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haggis_UK I just can't bear her voice🤦🏻‍♂️She's clearly trying to Queen's English it to sound posh but she is a tadpole in an ocean. If she becomes PM, I want to become UN general secretary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrew_lilico How is it 'United' Kingdom, key word being united, when you're telling NI to F off if they want to?? (they will) leaves 3, which v quickly becomes 2 after Scots said ta-ra, leaving England &amp; Wales. If that's a 'United' Kingdom, I'm Nelson Mandela🙄🤦🏻‍♂️ #Brexit #BollocksToBrexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EylonALevy Really, like she did with  Windrush, or Grenfell, or the homeless, or the children in poverty, or hostile environment policy, or the referendum Illegality cover up, Sorry like that you mean?  All she has now is self pity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PIGTROUGH10 @StNon_JC4PM2019 @jeremycorbyn I'd absolutely love to have a chat with him. Maybe help me understand why he says what he says 🤷🏻‍♂️😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeoplesMomentum So had nothing to do with #Brexit 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit #TheresaMay #trexit  So in last 4 years we'll have had:  2 General Elections 2 Leadership elections 1 Referendum  Common denominator? All to do with, or because of, the Tory party infighting 🤨 And we wonder why the country is in a mess🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealNatalieRowe He needs like minded around him, for after hours too 😉😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haggis_UK @tednharry It lasted less than nanosecond for me, then remembered when she called people citizens of nowhere, queue jumpers, Grenfell, windrush, hostile environment, homelessness out of control, foodbanks at highest level ever, austerity, all while she's been Home sec or PM. Never forget<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheresaMay #Brexit Spit Roasted🔥🔥👏🏼👍🏼😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikegalsworthy Just Brexit back stabbing Tories<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealNatalieRowe You mean gimps, no? 😉<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#TheresaMay #trexit #Brexit   .@theresa_may is still PM. If she had any guts she'd #RevokeArticle50 and say to new lot - start again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheresaMay #trexit  Tories have taken the narrative away from Farage &amp; Brexit Party. Funny that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheresaMay #Trexit #Brexit You can't say compromise but then have red lines which you ain't gonna move on. That's another C word - contradiction<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealNatalieRowe You 'stole' my line 😂 I tweeted it then saw this 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#trexit #Brexit  Tearing up, voice breaking? Cry me a river🙄 expect us to feel sorry for someone who gave no shits about anyone but Tory party, right till the end. If it was about national interest, she would have launched an enquiry into Referendum instead of covering it up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit takes down another PM   #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit #EUelections2019  #brexitparty literally have no shame. 'Vote for me, I want to be your MEP for North East of England, sitting in EU Parliament &amp; we want the UK out of EU. Also, I live in France'  🧐🤨😫🤷🏻‍♂️🙄🤦🏻‍♂️🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SparklyB @jlofromtarn @dontbrexitfixit It is yoghurt apparently🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Otto_English @piersmorgan If it happened as they say it did, get the kid /person who did it and bring him forward. But this is #BrexShitparty and I think they will do anything and everything to try get people on side. Right now, I wouldn't be surprised if Farage bus episode was a set-up too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Otto_English #milkshake Many questions Not a drop (virtually) on rosette 🤔 Regardless views on #Brexit, pretty sure old chap getting hit would have caused commotion yet all quiet🤔 Why no other pics? gone viral with no real proof with big mouths like @piersmorgan jumping on board<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@c_kennaugh @dontbrexitfixit Agreed. Sick of it. What most are missing is Farage is using same tactics that Trump did. The whole fake news, elite swamp etc  And guess who told him that?  Steve Bannon, who was over here a few months ago . What's scary is how many people are willing to blindly follow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@c_kennaugh @dontbrexitfixit Absolutely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heidiallen75 Everything is not what it may seem. It all looks staged to me Heidi. Why none on the floor or his face?🤔  apparently was thrown by someone on a bike, it would have gone everywhere (think Farage / Robinson)  all seems very 'controlled'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@c_kennaugh @dontbrexitfixit Apparently 10k of that was refunded, which was odd getting that from one person, then for it to be returned was even weirder. All very 🎏 to me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbcquestiontime If she voted remain, I voted leave!! I didn't.  So that means...🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 Wow, I agree with you again Owen!😉😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jlofromtarn @dontbrexitfixit Defo would have gone all.over the place if it was thrown from a bike, including all over the floor, which it doesn't seem to have🤨 Very odd indeed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeborahMeaden I was thinking same when Jordan said that 🙄😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Be quite easy to get it verified but I suppose it doesn't fit with your tweet narrative   https://t.co/d1DJN1VYEC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dontbrexitfixit If that's been thrown, how come none of it went on his face??🤔   I distinctly remember Farage, Robinson and that Carl fella getting milkshaked and it went literally everywhere, why not here?🤔 Very suspicious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like a #brexitparty meet up to me 😂 Which ones Fauxrage? #EUelections2019 #Brexit #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit If it's true that the 80yr old military veteran got milkshaked then that's disgusting🤬 But at same time, if it's turns out was staged, then what??🤔  Shopkeeper says he has CCTV footage to prove it was, Let's see it 🤷🏻‍♂️  #EUelections2019 #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Maybe you should check your facts before posting. Oh wait a minute, that's not your style is it<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StNon_JC4PM2019 @PIGTROUGH10 Being a good man and being a good leader are 2 different things.  Very rare to find 2 in 1😉😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StNon_JC4PM2019 @PIGTROUGH10 👍🏼 I've never said he's a bad man, I believe he is and wants to do good,  just don't think he's a strong leader. But let's see what happens 👍🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PIGTROUGH10 Ps that's not to say I disagree on everything he does, but defo his brexit stance, and given this was EU elections, by definition, you have to be for it, or against it. He was neither IMO and I feel for many good Labour MEPs who may suffer as a result.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PIGTROUGH10 😂 we may not always agree on JC approach, but I 💯% agree on what you said here👍🏼😉 I found it v hard TO vote Labour this time, even though most my life I have.  We can have a debate another time but for now, well done for voting, unlike those who haven't 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And so has my daughter, at Uni. Result👍🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#EUelections2019 Done the deed👍🏼 As did missus (Spanish) &amp; son. Thankfully we weren't #DeniedMyVote &amp; were no problems. We took her polling card AND letter from Council confirming in case was any untoward 👍🏼 #Brexit #StopBrexit  #LibDems #GreenWave #green #changeuk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sturdyAlex Said this to my wife last night. May is done. She tried her best but just couldn't find way to appease everyone, esp hardcore Leavers.  Therefore If they think they can do better, May Revoke's Art50, resign &amp; let someone else try AFTER been chosen by Electorate, not just party<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#pmqs #Brexit Why do I get feeling Andrea Leadsom had harsh words with PM, left &amp; thought 'she's gonna sack me before days out' so quickly put her resignation together - Jumped before she was pushed. Probably keeps many privileges by doing so 🤷🏻‍♂️  #BollocksToBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mike_Fabricant Seriously, are you guys for real?🙄🤦🏻‍♂️ You're not happy so you'll change the rules just so you can vote again to get her out.

<|startoftext|>#EUelections2019  MEPs are to represent us in #EU parliament.  So how does voting for ex-UKip / Brexit party MEPs do that? They want us OUT of EU, yet want you to vote FOR them so they can sit there to do what exactly?🤔 Tell EU they want to leave the  jobs they've just got??🤨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit #BritishSteel Well well well, another piece of BS from the arch Shyster Fauxrage🙄 At some point, people must realise he's a LIAR &amp; FRAUDSTER, not interested in working class, only out for himself &amp; his mates.  #BollocksToBrexit #BrexShitparty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenC42 @cirian75 I was watching / listening, thinking 'what is he doing??'🤬 A complete joke. Labour should be the party of the people in all Elections, not just GE. Perfect opportunity to nail Farage &amp; co but instead, he has let his MEPs down big time. I truly feel for them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertWinfield2 Groundhog Day 🙄 What deal? It's done. 4 months of trying, PM got virtually zero changes from EU, that was WITH no deal in place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adam_levy7 Ditto. Both leaders need to change. Any new Tory leader would eat Corbyn alive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PMQS I'm absolutely bored of how May behaves. I agree, she needs to go, but I don't think Corbyn should be there either  He doesn't know how to nail her down. If she's goes, he needs to too. Fresh blood needed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PMQS why is she talking about what Labour did 9yrs ago? I'm bored of it. Lab 'left' a high debt, but what is it now? TRIPLE THAT. Who did that??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ditterhansen @bankaudits1 Absolutely but Tory 9yrs, gone downhill, #Brexit sped this up. People are blinded by rhetoric.

<|startoftext|>@Clare_Jennifer @PolhomeEditor @jeremycorbyn Wes isn't the issue, it's JC.  He's simply not a Leader.  A protester at best. He doesn't know how to build bridges, it's his way or no way, which ironically is TM's too.  As it stands, If there's another GE, all I see happening is Kinnock 2.0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Clare_Jennifer @ProfJeffKenner @PolhomeEditor @jeremycorbyn Deary me🤦🏻‍♂️  There's loyalty and then there's loyalty!!🙄😂😂  'We' want Jeremy Corbyn?

<|startoftext|>@MichelleDewbs @brexitparty_uk @Nigel_Farage Michelle, how come you've not grasped the simple fact Farage has: No policies No solutions No answers to FACTUAL questions All he has is: BS rhetoric Lies  shouty-shouty methodology He hates on everyone who's not with him, and you have cheek to  say this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nearly noon and wondering why no one in Govt has resigned over #Honda 🤔 Pre-2016 it was almost a given, when there was still a pinch of doing the honourable thing. Post 2016?  ZERO. Just lies, falsehoods &amp; oh wells🤷🏻‍♂️  #Brexit #EUelections2019 #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#bbcqt  One of Hitler's disciples  .@Nigel_Farage is on regularly carrying the baton, using Goebbel's famous tactic "If you repeat a lie often enough, people will believe it, and you will even come to believe it yourself" This is the Farage playbook #Brexit #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JulietMEvans @UKLabour 🤨 Labour MEPs may not be Brexiters per se, however they cannot / do not make Policy / decisions off their own back = they will have to toe party line, or will not be Labour MEPs.

<|startoftext|>#bbcqt 2/2 remember watching him on QT before referendum talking about Norway &amp; we should do that, and yet now he's say, no I was always saying no deal. Bare faced Liar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#bbcqt  1/2 Still can't believe people are so oblivious to real issues that exist with #Brexit, 3yrs down the line.  People cheering Farage like he's new Messiah, yet he keeps regurgitating same ol' shouty-shouty BS, just under a different banner🙄🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn Bankers - check Bad employers - check Tories - check  NOT the EU.  So why are you going along with a corrupt and fraudulent referendum? By doing so, you become party to it. Remember that when the public enquiry starts...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn Irony of ironies🙄 You mention tax Dodgers and yet that's exactly what the EU want to clamp down on with their 2019 anti tax avoidance directive!!

<|startoftext|>@LenMcCluskey @jeremycorbyn Clowns 🙄 Honestly, if Brexit happens and goes belly up as expected for NHS and other sectors, you two Jokers are in for a fright. Blaming Tories will be the least of your worries, the centre voters you need at GE will not be there.  And what will that mean? Kinnock 2.0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sturdyAlex Welcome to the club😉 👍🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AaronBastani Really? Have you looked in mirror lately, cause i swear that's your picture😂 You lefties are absolutely devoid of any self awareness.

<|startoftext|>@fascinatorfun @sturdyAlex Same where I live. There are only 2 choices at present. Rosie Winterton received 57% as opposed to 34% Tory, and has a 10k majority.   Everyone else? Under 1500. Pointless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lisanandy Things have got to change??🤨 Why don't you start by changing the track 🙄 Every time on TV, same ol same old blah blah blah with no solutions or self awareness.

<|startoftext|>@nickystar911 @notmany4benny @stubbington81 @JolyonMaugham @BrexitPartyGB @jeremycorbyn So question is, why are #Tories proceeding with #brexit when  clear something is fishy. WHY not wait till investigations are over? WHAT are they afraid of? WHY is it taking so long for @metpoliceuk &amp; @NCA_UK to complete these investigations? WHO'S slowing them down?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickystar911 @notmany4benny @stubbington81 @JolyonMaugham @BrexitPartyGB @jeremycorbyn Not dismissed, Ignored. Quite simple. VL &amp; LeaveEU both found guilty breaking law &amp; fined, as most Elec Com can do, but passed files to Met Police &amp; Nat Crime agency for criminal &amp; foreign interference. Still ongoing.<|endoftext|>

What have you been smoking!1st responsibility is to his area Islington N = remain, &amp;  2. party member. He's leader of party that is 70%+ remain, why isn't he supporting that, when he said he'd do what party wants?   Funny what Power can do to you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickystar911 @JolyonMaugham He would if he thought you had a point!😂 Jo is right. Cons &amp; Lab will fudge a #Brexit compromise to avoid Euro elections. This isn't just about brexit &amp; what's best for UK, this is a political search &amp; rescue for both.  They know they will both get 🔨 if they take place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GregYerbury @Lawforall007 @JolyonMaugham Absolutely spot on. I said something akin 6mths ago, GM should be Lib leader<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DinasDevil @Andrew_Adonis Agreed Chris, it's such a shame. Labour become as bad as if not worse than Tories in so many ways. Tories try cover up their Shambles, Labour don't know how to! Embarrassing to watch JC &amp; front bench speak. They all sound like Milne has given them a script. And now Lord A too🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#marr #Ridge Every time I see this image, I go through 3 phases towards Parliament, especially @UKLabour. Astonishment.  Anger. Annoyance.  Why they supporting this?? #Brexit  #StopBrexit #VoteLeaveBrokeTheLaw<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MichelleDewbs @sturdyAlex More think about, stupider it seems. Farage created #BrexitParty to get MEPs in EU parl that HE wants UK out of 🤨 However, TM could do deal with JC = pretty much as we are (BRINO) = NF &amp; chums would be out of job immediately. Unless he knows something we don't 🤔 #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichelleDewbs @sturdyAlex Not rocket science 🙄 No deal, WA or a mashup = No MEPs, even during transition. Only whilst we're FULLY in will they able to sit. Why would #EU want UK MEPs interfering with their business when they're gonna be out? Which begs question, WTF is Farage actually doing?🤔 #brexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GloriaDePiero Call me old fashioned, but I believe BREAKING THE LAW IS BREAKING THE LAW &amp; needs full investigation / public enquiry.

<|startoftext|>@Andrew_Adonis You mean well Andrew I support you 95% but I'm afraid many Lab voters will soon be known as 'ex'.  He's been faffing for far too long &amp; we've lost trust.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveP264 @pakutanga Yes &amp; No. He was doing ok but clearly getting beat, then took a full power punch below the belt in/around fishing tackle. I felt it at home!😂  AK just thought 'nah'. TC is real deal but no need for that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CrawfordKhan @amirkingkhan Boxing Fan logic. Boxer gets hit on the side/ribs /solar plexus - he's winded, can't continue. Gets hit BELOW THE BELT, on /around the FAMILY JEWELS - he chickened out 🙄🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trboxing @SpecialKBrook @amirkingkhan Kell Brook is such a whiny loser. He's just crying because Khan got the fight and he couldn't. Instead of crying, why not fight a decent 154? It's pathetic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CrawfordKhan @amirkingkhan @terencecrawford No doubt fellow Brit Kell Brook gonna be out bashing Khan for not continuing. He needs to pipe down &amp; remember 4 words. Gennady Golovkin.  Erroll Spence. Quit in both.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@stephenasmith @amirkingkhan @terencecrawford Man, why are you not asking the obvious. Why did TC go full punch below the belt? Is that normal? He knew where he was hitting him, he saw what he was doing. All those saying he didn't catch him, I beg to differ. Big gloves, the tremors from that were felt in Bolton! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stephenasmith @amirkingkhan What?? Don't be daft. Let's see you take full blow to the nuts &amp; continue🤦🏻‍♂️ Khan may have gone on n lost, but was out of order by Bud. where's disgust annoyance at TC &amp; ref for shocking low blow??  If khan did it, you'd be all over it. Looks like Country favouritism to me.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Genuine question. Who Polices the Politicians?  With all the lies &amp; misinformation spread daily, seems they can pretty much say what they want and no one can do diddly squat. Something has to change.  #RevokeArticle50 #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage stupid comparison 🙄🤦🏻‍♂️ difference is, your lot cheated and got found out.  And now under Police and NCA investigations. Let's see how loud you are when all that comes out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MowgliGee @drmatthewhardy @Doozy_45 It is, but how did it come about? Holidays are for Easter,  Easter = Good Friday &amp; Easter Sunday = part of Christian faith.

<|startoftext|>Boris Johnson is a Racist??🤨 Who knew🤷🏻‍♂️😉 #RevokeArticle50 #Brexit #BorisJohnsonisaRacist<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@drmatthewhardy @Doozy_45 Ditto. Said same.

<|startoftext|>@JayneSeckerSky The power of twitter strikes again.

<|startoftext|>Strange one of our Journalist's is getting WORLDWIDE RECOGNITION for amazing reporting into fraud &amp; corruption surrounding #Brexit by her own industry, yet her own Govt is TOTALLY IGNORING her findings.

<|startoftext|>Find it hilarious (not)  .@jeremycorbyn .@HackneyAbbott defending Assange, yet won't say anything in illegality PROVEN by EC re Vote Leave, now being looked at by Police/NCA &amp; also have statements in Parl by whistleblowers?  What .@UKLabour scared of?? #RevokeArticle50 #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lord_Sugar Everyone with sense ignoring obvious. PM KNEW ref illegality (her QC said in high court) but triggered A50. WHY? Vote Leave had current ministers on committee, was  found guilty. Law not mean anything? If we brexit then comes out been criminally charged, then? #RevokeArticle50<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lord_Sugar In your words  'What a Load of Bollocks!' How can we continue process which in HoL you said was Lies &amp; Deceit, both Leave' camps guilty by EC, now under invgation by Police &amp; NCA?

<|startoftext|>As each day passes, this becomes clearer. Brexiters will adopt martyr status in next few months. Already started today with Farage.

<|startoftext|>@NickyMorgan01 The PM's QC admitted in High Court that TM knew ref had illegality but triggered A50 anyway.  Why aren't you bringing that up?  If you really had national interest at heart you'd have brought this and leave fraud out but sadly as always, Tory party 1st, country 2nd🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickyMorgan01 You see the problem. How can a process carry on which has such a shadiness hanging over it's head?  The LOGICAL thing would be pause Brexit/revoke A50,  have public enquiry then continue once everything clarified. As a solicitor, I'd've thought you'd be first to bring this up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickyMorgan01 Nicky, pls answer a few simple questions  1. Have both Leave camps been found guilty by EC?  Y or N 2. Are both leave campaigns and/or people involved, under investigation by Met Police and/or NCA?  Y or N 2. Are some involved in the cabinet, Isn't that a conflict? Y or N  1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RowlesDavis @JMPSimor Or Clark Kent 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Imogenlemon02 @PeterHalleone @cnapan @PoetTaxiDriver @aev1609 Tories won't call GE as it stands, as you say, too close in polls. But they do want to change leader asap &amp; push through brexit for tax avoidance purposes. Everyday we're in EU, we have to abide by EU anti-tax directive, which is whole point OF brexit for wealthy/elite Tories<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterHalleone @cnapan @PoetTaxiDriver @aev1609 If Leave won 52/48, it was clean, no cover ups by TM/Govt, no lies by MPs, no irregularities, no fraud, nothing from Elec Com, no cases forwarded to Met Police &amp; NCA for criminal investigation, then fair enough.  Labour know this but do nothing. Why is that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndreaInSurrey @PoetTaxiDriver @aev1609 That comes to my mind too. Why wouldn't they (Lab) call for a public enquiry, when PM's own QC said in High court that TM knew ref was illegal but still triggered A50. In doing so, she becomes part of it. It's a MASSIVE opportunity but seems they're deliberately avoiding 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PoetTaxiDriver @aev1609 All @UKLabour need to do is play Justice card. What are they scared of?? I believe if came out that fraud etc was true, heads would roll in Govt (ministers sacked, possibly on trial) and would collapse. And then that would be his  chance. Seems not a fighter of rights after all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PoetTaxiDriver @aev1609 Exactly. It's a massive potential win for them, call out Leave lies, ask revocation of A50 and a public enquiry into fraud, illegality &amp; possible criminal elements. Establish facts then see. But JC ignoring it🤷🏻‍♂️ almost as if HE WANTS Brexit to happen, as was his stance for 33yrs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterHalleone @cnapan @PoetTaxiDriver @aev1609 So why don't we feel they're acting in our best interests?🤔 To me feels JC goes with mood of moment eg mood pre Ref was remain, after 33yrs of Leave he switched. Now Brexit full steam again. What about the lies, fraud, illegality &amp; criminal investigations, why's he ignoring that<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FishBigThe @SpanishDan1 @theresa_may She's only trying to preserve the CONservative party for Govt and next GE. Not interested in people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesCleverly Not-so-Cleverly out with 'respect the outcome' BS🙄 Again🤬 James, in case you missed it, PM's QC said in High Court PM KNEW Ref was illegal, and she triggered A50 anyway, thereby admitting carrying out a fraud.  So which is it, Illegal or Liars?   #RevokeArticle50 #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MelisssfMelissa Good! Cunningly tell it's a Great idea and to pass it on 😉😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#RevokeArticle50 #Brexit Please .@DavidLammy .@Anna_Soubry .@sarahwollaston  Ask the PM why her QC said in High Court, PM knew Ref was illegal but triggered article 50 anyway? What is she hiding? As still investigations by police &amp; NCA going on, Why won't she have public enquiry?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Name the phrase you're sick of hearing.  Mine? 'Respect the Referendum' Aarrrgggggghhhhhhhh🤬🤬🤬 Knowing what she knows (as home sec &amp; as PM) How can she say that??  #RevokeArticle50 #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awesome. .@joannaccherry making the very point I did 5 mins ago re: PM losing the vote on her deal 3 times but 2nd Ref vote only lost twice 😉 Good work Ma'am 👍🏼  #RevokeArticle50 #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#RevokeArticle50 #Brexit  Theresa May has become a lame joke. She is being battered from pillar to post by  MPs across the house by repeating to her her own words. And yet she stands there, red as a raspberry in the face, with no shame, dignity or self awareness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#RevokeArticle50 #Brexit  .@theresa_may says to  .@IanBlackfordMP we can't have 2nd Referendum as HoC has already rejected it twice. Wait, What??🤨🤔🤨 Hasn't her deal been rejected by the house THREE TIMES! already, and now thinking about having a 4th go. HYPOCRISY MUCH 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit Sick to death🤦🏻‍♂️ Why does .@theresa_may keep saying 'In the national interest Parliament must deliver on the result of the referendum' HELLO?? You know it had illegality running threw it. Was your barrister lying in court or are you Prime Minister??  #RevokeArticle50<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now PM has #Brextension  .@theresa_may MUST have public enquiry on 2016 referendum. SHE KNOWS!! there was illegality, HER OWN QC said in High Court in Feb '19 I'd say most of country would accept it, except those involved of course 😉 #RevokeArticle50 #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tommoriarty16 Agreed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If only @jeremycorbyn stood in &amp; said 'Now we have #Brextension, we should have  public enquiry to get to bottom of Fraud, illegality, poss foreign interference in referendum, as well allowing Met Police &amp; NCA to complete their investigations' If only🙄 #RevokeArticle50 #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Andrew_Adonis 16 of 26 weeks are recess or conferences, Andrew, so actually not that long...🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JMPSimor @metpoliceuk @NCA_UK Said this to a friend Jessica. Why should public respect the Law, when LAWMAKERS don't or accountable?

<|startoftext|>@Andrew_Adonis Totally respect &amp; appreciate everything you're doing for #Remain in #EU &amp; #PeoplesVote but speaking as a Labour voter last time, I cannot in good conscience vote for Labour at this time.

<|startoftext|>@JoeHunter_ Tell her that the PM's own barrister said in High Court Feb 2019 that TM knew Ref was illegal (fruad, foreign money) but triggered A50 anyway.

<|startoftext|>@NemoSisterOTM @UKLabour Answer to question of why many Lab areas voted leave is austerity &amp; disenfranchisement, NOT FoM. Leave blamed EU, eg too many EU citizens here, pressure on schools NHS. In reality, Tory cuts was reason. UK always had power to control EU immigration, we've just not implemented it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NemoSisterOTM @UKLabour When PM, who has access to more info than me or you &amp; was Home Sec in lead up to &amp; time of Ref, lets her barrister state result was illegal but still triggered A50, shouldn't WE be worried?

<|startoftext|>What a bunch of bankers 🤦🏻‍♂️🤬 Why don't they just eff off &amp; join the ERG twats  #RevokeArticle50 #Brexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Three need sacking - .@michaelgove .@LiamFox &amp; Chris Grayling. And then there must a public enquiry in the fraud, illegality and subsequent cover up AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL. Sounds like UK version of Watergate... #RevokeArticle50 #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or in other words *adopts childish voice* 'I'm innocent, my daddy told me to do it. Go and ask my daddy' 🙄🤦🏻‍♂️ #RevokeArticle50 #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FraserNelson @pauldbenbow Load. Of. Crap Show evidence instead of spouting BS line like 'a fairly large majority'🙄 Every Remainer I've ever met doesn't even bring it up. It's a given - Remain = FoM. If you say UK should implement 2004 EU rule then many remain would more likely agree. But end it? No way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AprilFools  Funny thing, today of all days 😉 Saw a Petition, tried to sign, says already have 👍🏼  Proof below. So when you hear hot air balloons like .@JuliaHB1 &amp; other #Brexit idiots saying can sign up as many times as you like, you know it's BS #RevokeArticle50 #PeoplesVote  https://t.co/LWRxtflUdU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*tread carefully<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Marr I'm calling it - Bullshit .@GiselaStuart needs to read carefully. Public enquiry coming soon. Why destroy very data that would prove you've not done anything wrong??  As per norm, Leave a-holes basically Lying &amp; sticking 2 fingers up at everyone🤦🏻‍♂️  #RevokeArticle50 #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sallydipple @Haggis_UK Same. But Tom speaks much clearer / better so let's hope<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 @SkyNews I 'liked' for first bit of that sentence 😉 Not sure GE solves the Brexit issue, unless there is a long delay (12mths +) Right now, I see it hung parliament territory which means whoever formed the Govt would be in same position these Tory idiots are in now.  #RevokeArticle50<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Said similar Andrew. How come a march, estimates between 1 &amp; 2 million, but AT LEAST 1m, got 10 times LESS coverage on BBC/SKY etc than LML march, which had all day coverage, who had not even 0.5% (5k) of 1m? If Leave truly is the will, WHERE WERE THEY?? #RevokeArticle50 #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JolyonMaugham @michaelgove @BorisJohnson According to ol fish face Gove on Sky, they didn't meet on a Daily basis but once a week. So another Lie by him or they're misleading people - AGAIN - on the website. No way in hell he didn't know what was going on.  Gove can't be trusted to go to chippy never mind anything else<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Can't wait to see your face when you cover the cover up story of #Brexit Only matter of time before public enquiry into illegality which incl Vote Leave, Boris, Gove etc.   As ex-editor/Journo, I'd've thought you'd be chomping at bit to get these crooked politicians?🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit It's been plain sight all these years  - #CONservatives   #RevokeArticle50 #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Makes you wonder if this was their plan all along.  Leave on 29th then withdraw appeal =. Admitting guilt. Wouldn't put it past ANY of the Vote Leave Bar stewards  #RevokeArticle50 #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Utter madness. Why/How is Grayling in a job?? #Brexit #RevokeArticle50<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #Tories reveal their true intentions. This morning I've seen a steady line of attack on Twitter towards .@UKLabour by various #CONservatives blaming #Brexit on them. Can only mean one thing - *GoT voice*  General Election is coming  #RevokeArticle50 #SaturdayMorning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peston I would have shouted 'Thank you' Would have totally thrown them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ukip have deselected a Tory.  Huh?🤔😂 #RevokeArticle50 #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If nothing else, yesterday wholeheartedly unreservedly confirmed one thing. #TheresaMay IS DEFINITELY a Stupid woman* for bringing her deal back 3 times TO LOSE  #RevokeArticle50 #Brexit #BrexitDayNoMore  *not a gender issue. if she was a he, remove W &amp; O, still stupid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Westers1401 Go for it 👍🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When Theresa May has left public office, no one bar Philip will give 2 sh*ts about her &amp; what's she's doing, regardless she's ex-PM.  #RevokeArticle50 #Brexit  #DominicGrieve<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Conservatives Literally the minute the result came out, #CONservatives twitter team put this out. Tells you everything. Blame anyone but themselves  #RevokeArticle50 #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Conservatives Also on #BrexitDay, Vote Leave withdrew it's appeal against Electoral Comm, which means Lied, Misled, Broke Law &amp; now can't overturn in courts.  Simply - ITS ALL TRUE! And who's part of VL?🤔  Half of the @Conservatives cabinet. Why not Let people know that too #RevokeArticle50<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@georginafstubbs @Channel4News @CNN #RevokeArticle50 So this is what Gove's Mrs @WestminsterWAG meant when she said people would get lynched🤔 As usual though, like twatty husband, was wrong. AGAIN. w Was actually HER side doing lynching!!   #Brexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Timing Feels Significant  Maybe now it's time to start the process of healing. #RevokeArticle50 have a public enquiry, get to the bottom of it, then if everyone still wanted out, have that vote cleanly #Brexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaryllPitcher Yeah but at least that's his real name  😉😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder if all the people who voted Leave (what's that number again?🤔😉) know they're being represented by Tommy 'not my real name' Robinson in London today. Also, Why are all those Guilty of fraud or convicted criminals on Leave side?  #RevokeArticle50 #BrexitDay #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chuckle of the day 😂 - no.2 Nice one @NicolaSturgeon   #RevokeArticle50 #BrexitDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reality check. Let's be Clear.  The ONLY REASON .@Jacob_Rees_Mogg etc prepared to back TM deal is not it's best of bad bunch, it's because they still get to avoid 2019 EU Anti-tax directive under it. They don't give 2 monkeys about NI or backstop.  #BrexitDay #RevokeArticle50<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CarolineFlintMP Caroline is not xenophobic, not racist &amp; against austerity.

<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 Thousands marching??

<|startoftext|>@PointlessBrexit @UKLabour I'm voting for don't know. Seems like a decent person<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bomerH @MrMalky @KirstySNP It's all in the timing😉😉😂  Me with the phone, @KirstySNP with the honesty👍🏼  By comparison Nicky Morgan and Suella are so far up their own arses, they can see their wisdom teeth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@corsarof @MrMalky @KirstySNP @theresa_may True. Shame he's busy elsewhere ( USA / Trump)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit #Newsnight #FBPE #StopBrexit Sorry but #TheresaMay deserves everything she gets, incl a cold. Calling for everyone to unite behind her failed deal, yet not too long ago called Remainers / EU citizens -  Deeply Unhelpful Citizens of Nowhere Queue jumpers. How's about GFY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KirstySNP You were awesome, As we're your expressions👏🏼👍🏼😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NewsNight #FBPE #Brexit  @IainDale is happy for the country &amp; people to be poorer. Fact.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Brexit #PeoplesVote .@theresa_may has to resign. Lost twice - BIGLY - on essentially the same deal. Not sure why she hasn't already.   #FBPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#RevokeA50 #Brexit #StopBrexit  Let's see who's got bollocks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#StopBrexit #Brexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit #FBPE #PeoplesVote What are ERG up to🤔 Vote against May's deal = No deal. Tomorrow No deal loses = so must be a deal. On Thurs, extending Article 50 is defeated = ??? Answers contradict<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would it be a fair assumption that pretty much all advocates of #NoDeal #Brexit are Mostly Tory and/or Very well off. Or in simple language, won't affect them much.  #FBPE #peoplesvote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit #FBPE .@thomasbrake asking the most valid question so far. Whether WA gets through or not, we don't have enough time to get through legislation before 29th. Why doesn't she just say yes, it will need to be extended?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Or even just Faith  #brexit #FBPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Non #brexit #BrexitShambles #FBPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>V Significant. Do you think they knew this yesterday when negotiating with the PM? 🤔😉 #Brexit #StopBrexit #FBPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit #Backstop  Wtf is 'Bad Faith'?? Imagine going to court and saying to the judge 'Listen, I don't agree, You're telling me in Bad faith'  #FBPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#brexit #Backstop  Nigel Dodds stands up, the whole house goes quiet🙄 How shitty. The whole of UK is held ransom by 10 DUP MPs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#brexit #FBPE Snake oil salesman, trying to sell snake oil BACK to the snake oil company. That's the Attorney General.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#brexit #WithdrawalAgreement What the AG I saying is, nothings changed but back it anyway (politically) cause I'm a Tory and we're screwed otherwise.  #FBPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@campbellclaret @Geoffrey_Cox Absolutely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit #Backstop Brian Blessed is looking at AG Cox and thinking 'b*stard! he's rippin me off'  #FBPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage Agreed. Agreed. Agreed Flippin hell, I nearly fell off my chair😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit #Backstop  This guy is clearly ready for what's about to come today in parliament😉😂  #FBPE #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit @AldiUK  https://t.co/vimSlhmC1d<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesCleverly Coconut.  AG has said so, but as you 'Cleverly' admit, it's a POLITICAL choice, NOT a legal on.  On Tories heads be it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonathan_church @Stone_SkyNews @Geoffrey_Cox @jonsnowC4 Same 👏🏼👍🏼😂🤣😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stone_SkyNews @Geoffrey_Cox @jonsnowC4 He knows it IS bollocks (WA), nothings changed, told her so, so he's got plenty of time on his hands 😉😂 #Brexit #Backstop<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit #AttorneyGeneral So basically, she WAS talking bollocks yesterday.  Quelle Surprise. #GroundhogDay  #FBPE #StopBrexit #StormGareth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit  AG .@Geoffrey_Cox just took out .@theresa_may   #fbpe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This HAS to be read  Good one Faisal 😉👍🏼 #fbpe #Brexit #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C4Dispatches Key words .@Jacob_Rees_Mogg says 'the amount I RECEIVE' In other words, he ADMITS he receives AN amount.  Fact is, his financial interests are DIRECTLY linked to outcome of #NoDealBrexit. THAT'S THE KEY. Insider Trading.  Conflict of interests as an MP  #fbpe #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit This, ladies &amp; gents, is the most senior legal mind in our Govt. Beggars belief 🤦🏻‍♂️🙄🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️  #FBPE #StopBrexit #EU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We head over to a meeting between @theresa_may &amp; AG Geoffrey Cox  TM 'Please say it's ok' GC 'No, it's not' 'But please, it must be' 'No, it's not' 'But please' 'No, still not changed' 'But please, there must be away?' 'Nope, still same answer' Repeat... #fbpe #brexit #StopBexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Description of the day? DEFO 😂🤣 #fbpe #StopBrexit #brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Insider trading?🤔 #Brexit #fbpe #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit #EU #StopBrexit Oh I get it. They've changed the spine of agreement from Staples to Glue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peston @theresa_may She's lying. The withdrawal agreement has not changed one word, so says Juncker. Why lie??🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is what's REALLY going down  #Brexit #StopBrexit #FBPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit #EU  Basically, this whole thing is gonna come down to the legal advice of a guy who's the clean shaven relative of Brian Blessed!   #FBPE #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@campbellclaret I was thinking same<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit  Legally binding changes to agreement? Er no, Juncker just said the withdrawal agreement has NOT changed ONE SINGLE WORD. Why is she continuing to lie?  #FBPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit #EU Theresa May looks like she's lost her dog on a walk   #FBPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit  Still can't get my head round WHY John Redwood is a 'Sir' 🙄😏  #FBPE #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#politicslive #Brexit  Tory nodding dogs are out in force in Parliament 🙄  #FBPE #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 No but I can tell you about the ones YOU didn't start (car manufacturers) but seem to know more about why they're moving out than them!🙄🤦🏻‍♂️😂  Keep digging Julia, keep digging. #FBPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 Desperate. Can't win discussion, go with Childish behaviour🙄😂🤣 Seriously, teenager in a 50yr Old's body🤦🏻‍♂️ We honestly cannot wait till you are exposed for what you really are. Paid mouth piece for ERG types. Only. A. Matter. Of. Time😉 #FBPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, sounds about right 😉😱😱  #Brexit #FBPE #PeoplesVote  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Bob on 👏🏼👍🏼 #FBPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tim_R_Dawson Lost the debate??😂🤣 What debate? No debate, you LIED. Still are. Everyday. And then your lot lost case at Electoral comm, who said acted ILLEGALLY and now under investigation by Met Police and National Crime Agency. Let me know when they've concluded the cavity search<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EstherMcVey1 Esther does what Esther does best - lie, miselad then try and squirm out if it by redirecting. Absolute joke of an MP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Young, as in over 45? #FBPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a frickin Brexidiot 🙄🤦🏻‍♂️ #FBPE #brexit #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMattWain Why is this about Jess? She's not the Leader. Why are you guys always deflecting from the Friggin obvious? Corbyn is not a man of the people. He's never had a proper job in his life from what I can see, yet ALL his PR is aimed at showing him in that light.Don't pretend it doesn't<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Carole on the money. Again. 👏🏼👏🏼👍🏼 #FBPE #Brexit #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveBarclay Another Charlatan Shyster at work 🙄 Deluded. It's YOU who wants to open old arguments by wanting changes to backstop, NOT them🤨 Irony being, was British Govt who wanted it in first place &amp; EU agreed. Stop with blame game Bullshit to protect your arses.  #FBPE #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haggis_UK Mark Francois - Grade A nob🤦🏻‍♂️😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PoliticsLive .@JuliaHB1 - Just in case you didn't understand (apparently you didn't😂), this should help you both. Clear as a Swarovski crystal💎 #FBPE #Brexit #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 Julia with faux outrage🙄 Absurd Slurs?  Mark Francois, he of crisps &amp; chocolate infamy at tax payers expense (amongst other things), is not admirable in any way shape or form.  If you can't hear &amp; understand what Will clearly said, you're as stupid as him  #FBPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesMelville Depends on type. If you like a little electronic stuff, try anything by Disclosure. Settle is a great album, last year's tracks too, very eclectic 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#WillSelf Absolutely destroys #markfrancois with secondary school level intelligence👏🏼👍🏼😂 Seems Francois hadn't eaten his snickers before coming on. Best bit? Quite a few but for me, when Will says deadpan 'Apologise to who? Racists &amp; anti-semites?' Gold 😂🤣 #FBPE #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theresa_may No problem. Right after you've had public enquiry to determine lawfulness of referendum &amp; wait for Met Police &amp; NCA to finish criminal investigations into leave Campaigns. That of course, would be sensible &amp; right thing to do, but as we know, you don't do sensible or right #FBPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AaronBastani @tom_watson You guys are so pretty &amp; pathetic 🙄 Fluffing JC must be getting tiresome after 3.5yrs.🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#bbcqt If a whistleblower came out and said to labour leadership that in 2017 GE, the Tory party used illegal activity to win and he has proof. What would they do?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#bbcqt The way Dame Margaret Beckett speaks, can't help think she should be nearer the leadership. So much sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#bbcqt Dominic Raab is bullshit artist. Confirmed.  Again. David Cameron's at home pointing at the TV  ' That's my prodigy'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#bbcqt Seriously, watching this crowd in Dudley, there are some absolute idiots. I despair, but not surprised. Sheep. Also, Javed Khan is talking so much sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#bbcqt  Dame Beckett take a bow. Brilliant, passionate speech 👏🏼 Idiots in crowd booing her have no idea<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#bbcqt Flippin Eck! @OwenJones84 hits the target with his first go 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OldBobCyprus Some genius will say 'will of the people' or 'respect democracy'. Which as we know is absolute bollocks as vote leave didn't respect democracy by their fraudulent activities or Tory Govt  not allowing Brits abroad to vote<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#PMQs About Friggin time someone asked the most obvious of obvious questions! Unsurprisingly, .@theresa_may did the norm, ignored the question &amp; gave totally different answer.  WHY CAN'T SHE JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION?? 🤬 #FBPE #StopBrexit #Brexit #PeoplesVote #Complicit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peston @theresa_may @jeremycorbyn Just said similar. Both are pathetic. What's the point of it if nothing gets done?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PMQs  Anyone else bored of the same ol' shit. Someone ask a question, #TheresaMay gives a totally different answer, there's no follow up allowed. Repeat. What's the point?? #FBPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🙄🤦🏻‍♂️ .@theresa_may is like @JimCarrey in Dumb &amp; Dumber. Sells Harry's DEAD Parakeet Petey (head stuck on with sellotape) to Blind kid Billy in 4C. Eventually someone noticed he's stroking a dead bird!🤦🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️ Petey = #Brexit, Billy = MPs 😉 #FBPE #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Genuinely feel for most who voted leave in Sunderland. If not obvious before, should be now. You were Lied To, Misled &amp; Deceived. Problems aren't with EU, or FoM, or Laws.

<|startoftext|>.@theresa_may says #Police numbers nothing to do with crime levels. Yeah? Tell that to 70's couple assaulted at home, tied up, robbed &amp; assaulted again. Police turned up hour later. Not their fault. If there's 10 officers on duty &amp; 30 calls, what do they do? #fbpe #knifecrime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnMannMP What a joke🙄 Says the guy willing to take a bung but call it something else so it doesn't SOUND like it's a bung 🤦🏻‍♂️🤬 If you didn't know, the leave campaigns were found guilty for fraudulent activity. So if you were part of them, does that make you complicit too?🤔 #fbpe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarolineFlintMP Respect democracy?? 🤨😂🤣 So what about postal votes that weren't counted/destroyed? Or Brits abroad weren't allowed to vote, affects DIRECTLY.

Rather die than admit they're wrong or made mistake.  And many have. Figures have it that anywhere between 300 to 500k oldies have.  Ones who didn't vote - All 12m of them, they're the ones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Busiswa @JackkJazz @yorkshirefloss2 @carolecadwalla @LenMcCluskey Vote Leave files with Met apparently. 10 live investigations I hear. That cannot be right. Just on these facts alone, Brexit must be paused to get to bottom of who did what. You can't Brexit, have criminal investigations then find it was corrupted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackkJazz @yorkshirefloss2 @Busiswa @carolecadwalla @LenMcCluskey 🤷🏻‍♂️ Electoral comm did what it could to max within its remit &amp; passed files to Met Police &amp; Nat crime agency, who're investigating - allegedly! Political pressure/sensitivity seems to slown that down.Afterall, who do they report to? Home Secretary. Tories don't need that scandal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackkJazz @Busiswa @carolecadwalla @LenMcCluskey Politicians say whatever they need to, to get whatever they need to. Look at TM, been leading everyone on for last 2mths, but if you heard in isolation without hearing anything else, you'd say she was right / telling truth, where in fact she has got zero changes in that time🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackkJazz @yorkshirefloss2 @Busiswa @carolecadwalla @LenMcCluskey It did but with various leave campaigns overspending which allowed them to target FB / social media ads in last 10 days which swung the vote. Forget actual number but something like 50m more impressions which must've had affect.  No overspend = No Breaking of law = No Leave win?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackkJazz @Busiswa @carolecadwalla @LenMcCluskey Yet the fact is, it legally wasn't or still isn't. It's politically binding, nothing more<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StevieISpencer @castrogacio @cbtwittle @PaulEmbery @Femi_Sorry It's a real image alright, but it had  absolutely Nothing to do with referendum. Just Right wing, Xenophobic racist scaremongering propaganda by Farage &amp; co. Leavers can't hide it for long. It always comes back to immigration. Everything else is just waffle for them<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PaulEmbery @castrogacio @Femi_Sorry Wrong.

<|startoftext|>@sajidjavid You are amongst the Lowest of the Low. The son of an immigrant, now that HIS family are settled, wants to limit immigration🙄🤬 And further, he wants to STOP US from freely moving. Sound like the beginnings of a Police state to me<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GordonDudman If want to say respect the result, they should at least respect the Law &amp; allow due process to complete,  NOT continue knowing could turn out to be right. So why? Cover Up. TM knew before Ref as Home Sec, but stopped investigations. And who benefited most? She did - Became PM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GordonDudman I agree. e.g. you're in job, employer becomes aware under invgation, or had interview, they'd either suspend or wait till resolved, then offer job or resume. Even then, 99% make excuse to dismiss or not give. And this is Whole UK we're talking about! Why not resolve first? #bbcqt<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChrissieGrech @PennyMordaunt Seems whole world knows - except for #Brexit voters IN UK!! Mention this, they roll their 👀 &amp; go hyper defensive. Always say knew what voted for.

<|startoftext|>@Johnr421 @trumpy675 A Labour AND Tory Govt fault as that EU law came out in 2004, but Tories have really used the result of not applying it more, to their own ends, hoping public is blind and ignorant.

<|startoftext|>Still fuming 😤🤬 Just proves elite / wealthy Brexiters DON'T.GIVE.A.SHIT. about average person.Yet very same people who will be hurt most, prob voted Leave🤦🏻‍♂️  What's worse, many STILL think it's a great idea🙄🤪 #BBCqt #Brexit #peoplesvote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@barrow_chris @thurstonarnold That's what I said😂 Take 2🎬 Seems they're all involved somehow, in Abbott's case, she knows (too) but doesn't want to open that can of worms (now). As Home Sec (if Lab won) she'd be able to (open that can) although that's million miles off (Lab winning GE atm) Hope that helps👍🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some of these #brexiters are LITERALLY OFF THEIR ROCKERS!!?!!!🤪 How can nearly 500 people LOSING THEIR JOBS be 'a good thing'???🙄🤦🏻‍♂️🤪🤬🤬 #skynews #Brexit #StopBrexit #BBCqt #BBCTW   https://t.co/4UIjdRCAIU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JMPSimor Maybe ask .@bbcquestiontime  who / how audience is put together. What's the criteria for selection? Who chooses the questions asked? Seemed very weighted to Leave - regularly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tingeytony76 @ProUdin2016 🙄 If EC biased, would have found #remain GUILTIER, Ref result voided as both at fault = #NoBrexit = Remain happy. Then you could moan!!

<|startoftext|>@FinancialBear @metpoliceuk @NCA_UK Or maybe, political pressure, they've been 'told to' ease off / hold back, by say the Home Secretary, until Brexit has happened🤔 Can you imagine if they came out now and said, Gove, Johnson, Farage, Banks colluded etc If we thought things mental now..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn @theresa_may Should look into that. It's called backing to #RevokeA50  = No #NoDeal. Then have proper debates with actual facts &amp; figures, have Law breakers fully Investigated &amp; sent down. People need to be honest. The Referendum wasn't honest.  It was CON job by right wing CONservatives.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#bbcqt #BBCTW  I'm CONfused  .@Jacob_Rees_Mogg  &amp; all CONservatives who voted against #TheresaMay in Vote of CONfidence, Suddenly, after she loses vote of her flagship Policy by HIGHEST FIGURE EVER, decide to get behind &amp; vote with her in CONfidence in her Govt. See a pattern🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@griffster272 Lol or fact both Leave camps came before Select committees in HoC &amp; ADMITTED used Lies KNOWINGLY during Ref campaign to CON people has nothing to do with anything🙄🤦🏻‍♂️ If anyone broke law - investigate, regardless of side. But you can't continue process until that's resolved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tingeytony76 @ProUdin2016 you maybe right, but only both Leave camps were found guilty of Breaking the Law, fined &amp; referred to Police/NCA. Also, it's out that Leave built in to budget an allowance for fines waaay before Ref. Who does that? Perhaps someone who KNOWS gonna break the law &amp; be fined🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thurstonarnold Makes you think. Seems they're all involved somehow, and in DA case, she knows, but doesn't want to open that can of worms. As home sec, she'd be able to although that is a million miles off ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ellinst @curiocat13 What's worse is, all the players involved, incl Ministers &amp; ex - Gove, Johnson, Davis, Cummings, Elliott, Banks, Farage, Grimes etc. Are STILL on airwaves spouting those lies. And why is it taking so long to investigate?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ellinst @curiocat13 Allegations of both? Do you mean remain &amp; leave, or both Leave camps? not aware of remain ever being found guilty by Elec Comm, whereas both Leaves' were found guilty of Breaking the Law by EC, Fined as that's all they can do, THEN file referred to Police / NCA for Crim Invg.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cyberFluke @FibonacciNature And not forgetting the 1.1m postal votes that were NOT COUNTED, which was controlled by an ex Tory minister's company, who just so happens to be pro-Brexit no deal type.

<|startoftext|>@ToryFibs Not sure what's wrong with that? Maybe more should have. Jeremy cannot force his / front bench will on the party. What the party says, he has to do. But seems to be dithering.  Time for leadership is now.  Made his move, now let's see what he's all about.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 #Brexit will make 5 x worse. Already bad, what's gonna be like if happens?

<|startoftext|>@DrKRodgers @jonathan_church @matteoj17 @Channel4News Think you'll find GE result of 2015 MORE than held them to account 😉 The point is, and this is JC front bench problem, they should be MAKING FRIENDS at time like now, NOT point scoring. But they simply don't know how to, which is odd, given Corbyn is career politician (36yrs?)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Channel4News Is he stupid? As it stands, knows they can't win without EVERY OTHER PARTY (plus more) voting with them. Yet he talks as if they've already won??

<|startoftext|>@BrexitBin @jeremycorbyn Spot on. He missed a trick, or 2, or 3, or 4.. You see what I mean. Any serious political operator should not have needed notes at this point.

<|startoftext|>I think I can safely say that, unless some unicorns turn up at #DUP hq, @jeremycorbyn isn't winning the #VoNC. So then what's his plan B🤔  #StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit #PeoplesVote #BrexitVote #brexitdebate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Then she blamed having to get private consultation with Doc as hosp overcrowded &amp; busy. Again pointed out that's actually Austerity / underfunding by Tories which means less staff / resources, rather than just more immigrants. Nope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>something has to change as we can't cope. I pointed out it's not EU or citizens fault, rather ours, as EU 3mth law (explained, she didn't know about it) which has never been applied would have controlled that. Nope.

<|startoftext|>@PaulbernalUK @mefinx Same. Just stating the flip. wasn't meant in a funny way or anything😉  I think JC fans are blind to obvious. He lost the GE. Yes they gained more seats that 2015 - but he still had less than what Brown got in 2010🤷🏻‍♂️ And in 9 out of 10 polls, he's still behind - even now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulbernalUK @mefinx Sorry, you keep saying last time to YC but last time I looked, Corbyn didn't win GE, even with this so called mega majority in party.Should your standard apply to him🤔 Instead country STILL went for Maybot.

<|startoftext|>@theresa_may You are a Charlatan &amp; a Shyster of PM. You mean the fraudulently obtained verdict?? The 'people' DOES NOT mean everybody. Another lie!

<|startoftext|>@paulmasonnews You kidding, right Paul?😂  Did NOT sound OR look anything like PM. Ill at ease in that suit, trying too hard to be something clearly not.

<|startoftext|>@Haggis_UK @lloyd_rm And this, ladies &amp; gents, blows massive hole in 'Lets go to WTO' argument😂 One of reasons given for leaving by hardcore Brexiters is EU is unelected (100% wrong) On other hand, they say let's go WTO. Therefore, can Leave show me how/who elects WTO committee that make rules??🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GracieSamuels @ToryFibs @rupert_baines The issue is the rules were broken. It's been proven. And what's more, they KNEW they were breaking them BEFORE the referendum. They actually built into their budget an allowance for any fines. Who does that? People who want to deceive / cheat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GracieSamuels @ToryFibs @rupert_baines Also 1.1m votes (most postal) were not counted/discarded. An ex-Tory ministers Co (pro Brexit) controlled that. Do quick search, you'll see. Again, why?  That most likely changes result. You're only seeing small picture. The bigger one is how everyone was duped, and still are<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GracieSamuels @ToryFibs @rupert_baines Didn't read my tweet or ignored. The Law was broken, that has a process, which is being ignored by TM / JC. WHY?🤔 Anything else, nothing would proceed until resolved. e.g. job interview, they knew were under investigation, wouldn't do anything til sorted. Why is this different?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Puzzled. MPs are lawmakers, yet all they seem to be doing is IGNORING law breaking in Ref &amp; continuing with #brexit? Should a process under CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION by Met Police &amp; NCA, continue, or wait til resolved? #STOPBrexit #bbcqt #RevokeA50<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Somewhere between 600k-800k jobs in UK car industry, directly and indirectly, on the line in if #NoDealBrexit happens.  #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DinasDevil Everything just seems odd.  They're telling us one drone has brought 2nd busiest airport to a standstill, and they don't have foggiest of who/what/why/where/when &amp; how, in 24hrs??? They could literally look in my kitchen as I type this!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Out there but as each hour passes, why does this #GatwickDrones episode feel self-driven?

<|startoftext|>@MuirisOConchuir @NadineDorries #Brexidiots Indeed 👍🏼 thought I was only one who used that term 👍🏼😉 A sitting MP, CANNOT in ANY good conscience or morals, believe #NoDeal can be good for anyone apart from disaster capitalists. when you look at those supporting hard #Brexit &amp; what they do besides, you know why<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NadineDorries The bigger question is, how the hell did you become an MP with the knowledge of an amoeba of how EU, WTO, CU &amp; SM works??🤦🏻‍♂️ 30th March, No Deal = No transition. We crash out of ALL EU treaties with immediate effect &amp; have nothing in place to replace them. Feel free to check<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 @pollytoynbee think you'll find that 17.4m figure is now wrong, more like 16 point something, what with a load of oldies who voted leave passing away. Add to that the 1.5m 16-17yrs old who couldn't vote in Ref but can now (and would vote Remain) and you're onto a hiding 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Peston @Peston Maybe for balance, you should look up the clips of Philip Hammond calling Andrea Jenkins a stupid woman &amp; David Mundell calling Yvette Cooper a B*tch - both in parliament Just saying 😉 FTR they're all idiots.

Disgraceful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Peston #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote  Nadine Dorries says Corbyn normalised language. GFY!

<|startoftext|>@Femi_Sorry As much as Iove your dogged (&amp; brilliant) explanation of economic &amp; legal damage of #Brexit, Bottom line? basically boils down to 1 main thing - Immigration.

<|startoftext|>@l1v34t3ch I too have an EU / Int. family. wife is Spanish. Anger / division is due to Tory policies, Ref happened, allowing EU to be fall guy for many of our ills.

<|startoftext|>@LowTaxChloe Believe in Britain??  Bit frickin ironic coming from an Aussie Bogan🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@l1v34t3ch 😉 It's all brinkmanship, scare tactics &amp; blackmail for MPs to vote for her deal. I can't imagine Theresa May wanting to go down in history as PM who led the country to chaos &amp; disaster, simply because they didn't vote for her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #NoDealBrexit happened &amp; there's Food / Medicine shortages, think only fair that ones who wanted #NoDeal most, should be ones to forgo things first.

<|startoftext|>Couldn't Agree More .@eddiemarsan👍🏼 The more this whole sorry #Brexit saga unfolds, the more it seems like some B grade movie script with shit actors that got made.  #stopbrexit #FBPE #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan 40k trucks, only 2k licences to be issued on lottery basis. Pls explain what happens to other 38k?? People like you, Farage talk Bollocks as don't know facts.

<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Also, warm to this as sort No deal. One firm, 300 trucks, crossing to EU every week, 8k consignments in each truck. Every c/ment needs 3 docs from HMRC. = 7.2m documents per week. And that's just ONE firm with 300 trucks. There's 40k trucks going across every week<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan You were a remainer??

<|startoftext|>@BritsAgainst @CllrCarpenter @Sorreltiger @Peston @theresa_may What'd be worse is some form of Brexit to go ahead only for Met police / NCA come back and say whole thing was fraudulent, there was foreign money involved &amp; So an So (leave campaign members) are to be tried. How's that gonna look??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BritsAgainst @CllrCarpenter @Sorreltiger @Peston @theresa_may what this all means is clearly Dodgy &amp; many from Leave were mugged off.  Hardest part for anyone is to admit they made a mistake, or fell for Lies. It's embarrassing. It's about pride. My Message? Don't be. We understand. And It's not too late, even now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BritsAgainst @CllrCarpenter @Sorreltiger @Peston @theresa_may Absolutely. Why Leave voters CAN'T / WON'T accept facts there are currently  CRIMINAL investigations going on into both Vote Leave AND LeaveEU, as well individuals, by Met Police &amp; more worryingly, NATIONAL CRIME AGENCY (UK's FBI involvement ) is scary. NCA = foreign involvement<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FunSoph No need. What you said<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CllrCarpenter @BritsAgainst @Sorreltiger @Peston @theresa_may Considered the facts??😂 Why not get them right for starters! 52% of country? WRONG! It was 52% of those who voted. Then take the whole country - 67.5m, minus leave voter - 17.4m = 50.1m or in other words, 63% DON'T want to leave. How the eff is 17.4m the will of 50.1m people??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pwsimerimiaw Agree there is a difference &amp; element of fear too but it's more losing seat than physical kind.

<|startoftext|>Well well well. After electing #TheresaMay in 2016,  then again backing her at 2017 GE, #tories now changed their minds &amp; want to replace that decision. Funny how it's ok for them to change their minds..🤔 #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit #FBPE #PMQs #BrexitVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasparCJ I'll tell you who is, the leave campaigns, You know, the ones with 10 ACTIVE criminal investigations by National crime agency and Met police currently going on.

Let me guess, Media bias? 😂🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sullisms @Armsman47 @georgegalloway @Tony_Robinson @JennieGenSec Honestly, you guys need to get real. Govt going to change, stop Austerity or cancel UC with immediate effect, just cause he ASKED at PMQs??🤔 Think bad now? wait till Brexit-Austerity kicks in. Economy gonna tank = recession. Should focus on stopping it THEN topple Tory B'tards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Armsman47 @georgegalloway @Tony_Robinson @JennieGenSec Not at all. You assume too much. We can agree on one thing - dislike for everything Tory.

<|startoftext|>@d_r_jones47 @Armsman47 @georgegalloway @Tony_Robinson @JennieGenSec WE'RE a cult??😂🤣  Corbynistas - THAT'S definition of cult🙄🤦🏻‍♂️😂 Sorry, you assume.

Can't see it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Armsman47 @georgegalloway @Tony_Robinson @JennieGenSec DEFINITELY bothers me, 100%, BUT by bringing them points up other day, what did he/you think, that Tories going miraculously change policy overnight??🙄 makes zero sense.

<|startoftext|>@Armsman47 @georgegalloway @Tony_Robinson @JennieGenSec 😂 true re Tories but when you say on brink, why not give them the final push?😉 Any true leader would have capitalised on that moment on Wed at #PMQs  He missed a trick IMO Let's see how it plays out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@georgegalloway @Tony_Robinson @JennieGenSec I agree on many things (Blair) but surely you can't sit there &amp; tell us Corbyn has been doing well of late.

<|startoftext|>1/2 PM represents UK &amp; negotiates 'deal' for #Brexit in line with result.  By definition, .@theresa_may is default representative for #Leave  Whatever she gets, it's for leaving.  #StopBrexit #FBPE @BrexitBin  @cirian75  @OldBobCyprus @JamesMelville @DinasDevil<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bakehouse2016 To me it's even simpler. .@theresa_may is batting for #Brexit as she keeps repeating mantra 'we will be leaving the EU on 29th March' so by definition her 'deal' is on behalf of #Leave Therefore, choices for a #PeoplesVote should be her #BrexitDeal or #NoBrexit = #Remain<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What's the point of having a Q&amp;A with the PM .@theresa_may  in parliament if all she does is say please refer to my previous answer or even worse, ignores the question altogether and gives a totally different answer?

<|startoftext|>@theresa_may course you will, another low-tax-free haven for your buddys. Fact 96% of Gib wants to stay in EU means nothing.

<|startoftext|>#bbcqt  sick of politicians like Claire Perry who keep saying  'we had a vote'. Yeah? Well we had GE in 2015, so why did Theresa May call another in 2017?

<|startoftext|>@ShehabKhan Imagine a scenario in a year's time if No Deal Brexit happens, where Rees-Mogg or someone of that ilk, stood at box as part of Govt explaining to house why everything's going to shite, yet it's still great. And Theresa May calling them out!  That's exactly what'd happen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grumpy_southpaw @paulmasonnews @Gtr910 @DominicRaab Lol think the gap is too big but 🤷🏻‍♂️ The polls for #PeoplesVote show majority want it so should we ignore them too?   I'm not hating, just stating 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 Not sure about N U Govt, could be solution to get through #Brexit, but personally don't think, nor do most polls, #Labour can win either, which by definition puts Tories in situ again &amp; curtains for Jez.

<|startoftext|>@DizzyJB @PeterMatza @vjm789 @weighedin @eddiemarsan This doesn't even take into account that both May &amp; Corbyn continuously IGNORE breaking of the law by both Vote leave and LeaveEU, and the ongoing investigations by Police and National Crime agency into them.  It's like they never happened<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DizzyJB @PeterMatza @vjm789 @weighedin @eddiemarsan Exactly.  If use #TheresaMay / #Corbyn terms, we had referendum in 1975, we voted &amp; will of the people overwhelmingly was to be in EU. Why did we need another then? if can have one in '16 to override '75, then we can have another now to decide on deal #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PropertySpot @EmilyThornberry What's a 'British style' FTA? They all turn up in Union Jack suits to negotiate?😂 Remain are anti-democratic,  Yet wants another GE just 17 months after LOSING last one, cause DOESN'T LIKE what Tories are doing. So by her definition, she's anti-democratic? 🙄🤦🏻‍♂️😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AKA_Porlek @terrychristian @jeremycorbyn Corbyn been MP 35yrs, earning tidy sum each year, isn't really working class. More like political middle class.

<|startoftext|>@AKA_Porlek @terrychristian @jeremycorbyn Austerity was political choice, Tories chose to, NOT cause we're in or by EU🙄 Starve services to brink of collapse, call in tory private contractors.

<|startoftext|>@tillysbrae @CorbynSuperFan @OzKaterji @terrychristian @jeremycorbyn Wait a minute, You're talking about guy who as leader, had pic taken sat on floor on train carriage doorway (on way to Newcastle) saying 'look, trains are overcrowded &amp; need nationalising', tweeted it, THEN went &amp; sat on the seat that was actually booked for him? 🤔😉😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This sounds like a Great idea. #marr #PeoplesVote #FBPE #stopBrexit #StopBrexitSaveBritain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w41gy Agreed, but wasn't the last GE a referendum on Corbyn, Labour and his manifesto?  People didn't want it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Marr  Emily Thornberry  keeps harping on about another GE, says we can't have #PeoplesVote as already had referendum. Then why should Labour be allowed to go for another GE only 15mths after LOSING at last one??  Height of Hypocrisy  #stopbrexit #FBPE #ArmisticeDay100<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What .@jeremycorbyn said - 'We can't stop #brexit ' What Corbyn MEANT -  'I don't want to stop brexit as been waiting my whole life for it &amp; not gonna intervene no matter what is said or happens, or how many jobs are lost.

<|startoftext|>@Labour4EU I say same. People need to understand in real world what #Leave means. You wouldn't buy house after offer accepted then searches come back giving bad news - you'd pull out!

<|startoftext|>@stuart_gavaghan @Femi_Sorry Funny you say remainers are Stoking GFA when it's actually DUP (leavers) who are specifically saying we cannot have a border.  If we leave EU with #NoDealBrexit WTO rules state categorically there MUST be hard border between the 2 countries. Fact. Also, WTO is unelected 😉😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheNewEuropean 'Do as I say, not as I do' 🙄  Could apply to all #Brexit idiots. Farage - German p/ports for kids. Lawson - French residency,  Mogg - opens office in Dublin, Banks - Belize passport, plus others. Seems happy to let YOU SUFFER while they don't.  Why is that #Leave voters? 🤔<|endoftext|>

Not a bad man, just a poor Leader.  #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 Are you for real??🤨🤦🏻‍♂️🤣 Let me know how it goes when your Sith Lord brainwasher &amp; Co get smashed at next GE.  Basic politic FAIL Owen.

<|startoftext|>@MrAAH02 @joey_knees #Corbyn KNOWS Law was broken by BOTH Leave campaigns, yet CONTINUES to say 'Will of people' when clear has to be police investigation to find out who did what. Of all people, I'd have thought he'd be first to demand that, being a so called champion of injustice (see Chile)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrAAH02 @joey_knees I want to see #Corbyn fight for rights, jobs etc by TELLING TRUTH about HARM #NoDealBrexit or any #Brexit will do, convince #Labour &amp; All of benefits of #Remain, instead of constantly talking b*ll*cks &amp; burying heads behind fraudulent notion of will of people THEN could win GE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beggars belief🤦🏻‍♂️ These people really do exist &amp; scarily, live amongst us 😱 Another massive reason why we need a #PeoplesVote  #FBPE #PeoplesVoteMarch #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gaurangmorjaria So basically he's a protester🙄  You are sadly wrong, He will never be PM. He is STILL behind in every poll, even though the #Tories are all over the place. Open your eyes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most INEPT #Tory Govt IN HISTORY &amp; .@jeremycorbyn can't even get past them in polls!🤦🏻‍♂️ People are p*ssed &amp; hate policies but seems would prefer to JC, who just can't grasp mood or what's going on with #Brexit &amp; #PeoplesVoteMarch  #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit #BrexitShambles #FBPE<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 @rupert_higham If they did &amp; senior members of #VoteLeave found guilty, that'd make whole Ref null &amp; void, and #Brexit would ground to a halt. Doesn't suit agendas, Blue or Red. As far as I'm aware, no one besides .@carolecadwalla is really pushing this. Strange 🤨🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 @rupert_higham Owen, you talk about big news story, yet you ignore ACTUAL biggest, right under your nose🙄 Police is sitting on file re #VoteLeaveBrokeTheLaw, not investigated for 6mths due to 'political sensitivities'. We're talking Watergate level. So why are you not banging on about that?🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What. A .Twat🤦🏻‍♂️🤬 Time for a leadeship change.  #PeoplesVoteMarch #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit #FBPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrChrisBennett @jeremycorbyn 👏🏼👍🏼😂  'Unfortunately,' fact remains, as he's leader of opposition, he should OPPOSE the situation Govt is creating, the #NoDealBrexit scenario which would be disastrous for jobs, workers &amp; business alike - the ones he's supposed to represent!! Yet nowhere to be seen 🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rupert_higham @OwenJones84 Both but Sat about #PeoplesVoteMarch. Sadly #Yemen going on for years &amp; will continue to😔 disgraceful, heart bleeds. can stop in sec if wanted but won't 👉🏼💰💰💰 Same for Brexit. Will affect millions, businesses struggle/close, only few elite benefitting. That's why pushing it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 @rupert_higham But Fact remains, 2nd biggest march EVER in UK &amp; you're talking Khashoggi?? Not hard. You knew your guy JC gonna be under attack for being AWOL so you gave him cover 😉 Embarrassing. He's leader of opposition &amp; not even in country when 700k people are marching in London 🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 @rupert_higham Khashoggi incidents have happened before, will happen again🤷🏻‍♂️  Saudis made rookie (cocky?) mistake &amp; got caught. Our Govt complicit? nothing new, going on for years &amp; will continue to. Money talks.  Same goes for #Brexit &amp; why #Brexiters want out - Personal financial benefits<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today .@jeremycorbyn has shown that he is either an absolute genius politician who's waiting for the 'right' moment OR,  he's a complete fool who is totally out of his depth🤨 Go figure 🤷🏻‍♂️  #PeoplesVoteMarch #London #peoplesvote #StopBrexit  #WheresJeremyCorbyn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vintage347 @queenEvieB @jeremycorbyn 👍🏼 he's been anti-EU forever but at Ref was #Remain - allegedly, although half hearted AT BEST. only went remain as he'd recently become leader, didn't want to pee off his supporters. Misjudged it then, he is again now. Doesn't seem to be able to grasp political moods🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@queenEvieB @jeremycorbyn I want him to DO HIS JOB as the opposition leader and oppose the madness of #Brexit!!!!  His ONLY chance of becoming PM is coming out &amp; taking the #PeoplesVote bull by the horns. He's missing a PR trick BIG TIME!  Badly advised or happily misguided.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Irony of ironies - part 2 What do you call an opposition that doesn't oppose?  #PeoplesVoteMarch #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit #FBPE<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@darrengrimes_ THIS is what we see &amp; hear🙄 What a Patsy 🤦🏻‍♂️ Anyway, Why don't you go ask help from your #Brexit guys who got you here in 1st place, instead of begging from public? Surely with your multi millionaire pals, one could easily step up🤔  https://t.co/QCEdmdl9mz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MediaWeasel @JaxxAI Just like Trump has in the USA. Funny how it's the same companies helping trump &amp;  leave campaigns - AIQ &amp; CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA🤨🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MediaWeasel @JaxxAI That's because some of them don't / can't admit the truth, namely they're flat out racist. Again I say some. They use the pressure on services, ECJ, unelected EU crap as a 'cover' for their true feelings. This is what #Farage &amp; co have exploited &amp; right wing media fan the flames<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaxMigliorato @oxymoronictimes When you say 'relieve', you mean a no.1 or 2 I'm guessing 😉😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffRookerj That's what I said in a follow up post.  The way it's been portrayed and Lies told before, during and after referendum by the likes  .@Nigel_Farage that it's the EU's fault, when clearly it isn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrexitBin @Francesbarnby @YsWords2014 @dontbrexitfixit @MarieAnnUK @JasonJHunter To be clear, not advocating this as a policy for those already settled, but if we said to leavers let's remain in SM &amp; CU but we will enact this going forward<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrexitBin @Francesbarnby @YsWords2014 @dontbrexitfixit @MarieAnnUK @JasonJHunter If tomorrow,  started repatriating loads of EU citizens using 3 month rule, who are NOT working or unable to support themselves or don't have med Ins, perceptions would change<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrexitBin @Francesbarnby @YsWords2014 @dontbrexitfixit @MarieAnnUK @JasonJHunter Question stands - WHY didn't they? My guess? Easily available cheap labour for companies/business = more profits, as well as rent for landlords. And b/c our GOVTS didn't regulate &amp; repatriate, became overcrowded in certain areas, which naturally puts pressure on local services.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrexitBin @Francesbarnby @YsWords2014 @dontbrexitfixit @MarieAnnUK @JasonJHunter There's no doubt immigration affected some local communities but I don't blame EU or EU citizens. My point always been, those are rules &amp; they're staying within them. The issue IS &amp; ALWAYS been, OUR Govt NOT implementing EU law when they clearly can.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Francesbarnby @YsWords2014 @BrexitBin @dontbrexitfixit @MarieAnnUK @JasonJHunter I believe Remain would win  60-40 at least, knowing what we know now. That's why they - #Brexiteers - don't want another vote. Games up. They know they've been rumbled and using all tools - papers, BBC, Social Media - to try change the narrative. Keep fighting #FBPE #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Francesbarnby @YsWords2014 @BrexitBin @dontbrexitfixit @MarieAnnUK @JasonJHunter Good point but I rarely come across anyone who didn't tbf.  Most are #Remain or sheepishly say #leave or some BS reason which always leads to immigration🙄 Obviously millions didn't vote under impression wasn't needed as Remain would win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pauladunstable @YsWords2014 @BrexitBin @dontbrexitfixit @MarieAnnUK @JasonJHunter True, Guy at my gym  'I voted leave'. Me - 'why?' He's 55, overweight, working class but not working. All he he had was 'ECJ'🙄 'what's that got to do with you on D-2-D basis?'  No answer. Brainwashed. Sure what he really wanted to say was immigration but I had to go. Next time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Note to #Leave voters - You've been Lied To! THIS 👇🏼 explains how EU immigration works &amp; can be applied RIGHT NOW. Current &amp; Previous Govts don't /didn't apply.

<|startoftext|>Just in case #leave &amp; #Brexiteers were STILL going on about EU immigration, PLEASE LOOK AT THIS. This is EU law.  YOU'VE ALL BEEN LIED TO.

<|startoftext|>@MarieAnnUK Ditto. I just posted same thing 🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But the #Tories don't. Why is that?? We could easily have taken back control of our borders ALREADY under European Parliament and Council Directive 2004/38/EC, which allows EU member states to repatriate EU nationals.  #Leave LIED to the public, knowing full well we could.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#bbcqt Well done this Lady 👏🏼  said very thing Govt can do &amp; yet no one really understood 🤦🏻‍♂️ Through EU law we have ALWAYS had ability to repatriate people from EU within 3 months IF they dont have a job, can support themselves &amp; have medical insurance, FACT.  https://t.co/v61PyqOBNY<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JulieRenyard @cirian75 You hit the nail on the head. Most Tories ARE stupid enough to believe her. They love all that jingoistic rhetoric. Just like Trump does in USA.

<|startoftext|>@tnewtondunn Can someone ask McDonnell if he respects the last 2 elections as well then?? I'm not Pro or Anti  Tory/Labour but I flippin hate it when these idiots come out with BS lines like this 🤦🏻‍♂️🤬🤦🏻‍♂️🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting stuff from inside 👍🏼 #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote #FBPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So what .@johnmcdonnellMP &amp; .@jeremycorbyn are offering is 1. Have GE  2. Labour win 3. Ref with only Deal or No Deal.  If #NoDeal wins, go to #EU &amp; get extension or suspend Art50 till we know what's what🤨  Straightforward, apart from no.1🤦🏻‍♂️🙄🤬 #StopBrexit #FBPE #Liars<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right or Wrong, 'will of people' at 2017 GE was majority  .@Conservatives NOT  .@UKLabour. Curious now #Labour want another GE - 3rd in 3yrs - but not #PeoplesVote for #Brexit deal? 🤔 Doesn't another GE goes AGAINST 'will of people' from 2017 &amp; 2015?🤷🏻‍♂️ #StopBrexit #FBPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McConaghyBen @OwenSmith_MP @UKLabour Didn't expect anything less 🙄😂 You guys don't get it. You can't win without us - ex-Labour &amp; some Tory &amp; Lib voters too. FACT. Members mean nothing, apart from keeping JC in situ, as don't vote for whole UK.  Until he starts to appreciate EVERYONE &amp; not you few, he can't win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour situation room hard at work 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️  #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit #FBPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McConaghyBen @OwenSmith_MP @UKLabour 1. Never said was advocating for Smith. a foot soldier - at best. 2. JC has let power go to his head, become very thing he vowed not to. Tired of his BS lines &amp; contradictions.  e.g. 'will of people' - who? 27% of electorate? Then 'For the many, not the few' - so not the 73%?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't know why but get this cynical feeling re  .@jeremycorbyn &amp; backing #PeoplesVote if members want it. All conveniently on eve of #LabourConference2018 🤔 Just sounds too good to be true. And experience tells me, when that's the case, it usually is. #StopBrexit #FBPE #FBPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. 100 million percent. #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote #Lab18<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I get the feeling .@LenMcCluskey is either  1. Secret Tory elitist 2. Thick  3. Totally blind &amp; deaf to what's going on and thrown his #Leave dummy out.  #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote #FinalSay #FBPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McConaghyBen @OwenSmith_MP @UKLabour Funny, I'm a Labour voter &amp; he's alienated me last 12mths🤔  Needs to understand what Majority of labour members want. A #PeoplesVote on #Brexit deal with option to remain as is, or #StopBrexit by w/drawing Art50 (if wins GE)  If can't get that, step aside &amp; let someone who does<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bakehouse2016 Will someone ask him when the border is going up in NI?

<|startoftext|>@BBCPolitics @bbclaurak @theresa_may Turn the sound off...she genuinely looks like she's begging! Will someone please put us out of our misery and finish her off - politically that is. Resign or get sacked by parliament, or whatever! Worst PM in living memory. It's embarrassing and desperate🙄🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jacob_Rees_Mogg Do tell Jacob, how much you stand to make from #NoDealBrexit ?🤔 Imgaine, NO 2019 EU anti tax directives, could plunder away &amp; no one can do a thing🧐  Factor in what'd happen if was #Peoplesvote &amp; all makes sense now.  You're actually SCARED as can see ££€€$$'s disappearing😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrexitBin Wow, that's shocking! He can't even get in front of #maybot .@theresa_may !!  Nevermind, at least he's got biggest membership, eh 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️ That's what Corbynistas will say<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3/3 The blindingly obvious is staring them RIGHT IN THE FACE - and yet stupidly, one wants to carry on! This is where we're at after yesterday's #Salzburg fiasco  🙄🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️😠🤬  #FBPE #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit #SalzburgSummit18<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2/3 Results come back, show lots of flaws &amp; issues &amp; make deal ridiculously more expensive. One says 'Let's withdraw, it's far too risky. stay where we are for now' but out of stubbornness &amp; pride, other says 'No, lt'll be fine, we can sort it, let's buy anyway!'  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit thread Couple (leave &amp; remain) saw house, liked but are 50-50. After much debate, one wins argument (Referendum) &amp; makes bid. Seller accepts (reluctantly).

<|startoftext|>@Peston @theresa_may Er, every time she goes across the channel to mainland Europe perhaps 🤔😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crazywizdom @ali__samson Same. And then to see the faces and answers of Farage, Johnson Gove etc when there's riots due to the problems created. Then like in old days, have public hangings for these traitors who KNEW they were lying and betraying public for personal gain. That's the nightmare scenario<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShehabKhan Hope it's 3 but fear she'll be booted out before &amp; brexiteer takes over. Then we're REALLY screwed!! Tories all about self interest, not country's. Which makes Corbyn's stance even more confusing. No effective opposition. Anonymous. Should be ALL OVER Brexit, as people's champion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShehabKhan Not delusion Shehbab, fully calculated. can only mean 1 of 3. 1. Opener, knew get knocked back. will concede more as knows #NoDeal is v v bad. 2. Actually WANTS ND, knew would get rejected. Turns away. 3. Will use as cover for #PeoplesVote as can't deliver #BREXIT as promised<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShehabKhan What do experts know, eh?🤷🏻‍♂️ Apart form her own of course 😉😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@campbellclaret @JustinOnWeb @UKLabour MADNESS🤦🏻‍♂️ Directive coming from the top Ali. Ignore #BREXIT not our problem. #Labour hoping #Tories implode soon (looks likely) then GE called. THAT'S their plan.

<|startoftext|>@DinasDevil @UKLabour He's become what he swore he would not - a career politician. 35yrs, What has he achieved,   besides winning a leadership election against a bunch of none starters? What's that one thing he can say  ' I did that'. Can't think of anything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#bbcqt #bbctw  Imagine .@thatginamiller as party leader of #Labour or #LibDems? Articulate, confident, knowledgeable, cool under pressure.

<|startoftext|>🙄🤦🏻‍♂️ #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit #FBPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#bbcqt #bbctw  Andrew Neil monologue about Corbyn came straight from the top of the Beeb. The Tories are running scared and pulling out all the stops. First Theresa May at EU summit, now Neil.  Just a shame Corbyn doesn't get it, esp on Brexit  #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote #FBPE<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JasonJHunter You could be blindfolded, ear muffs on, hands tied behind your back and put in a dark room alone, and you'd STILL be more of expert than him, On literally anything 👏🏼👍🏼😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#bbcqt  Think it'd be fair to say in old money, Chris Grayling would have resigned about 6 times by now!!😂 How times have changed. You can be shite &amp; keep your job.   Oh for 'honourable' times when ministers said one wrong word &amp; packed their bags 🙄 #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#bbcqt  Seems Camilla Tominey is a David Dimbleby favourite. Every time someone else speaks, she interrupts. Nothing said.  Yet other way round, they're shut down. Weird that 🤨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#bbcqt  Can someone PLEASE ask a brexiteer on the panel 'would you buy a house without doing the searches, and once they came through, and they were not good, would you STILL carry on?'  #PeoplesVote #FBPE #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DinasDevil @theresa_may @UKLabour @jeremycorbyn 👏🏼👏🏼👍🏼😂🤣😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DinasDevil @theresa_may @UKLabour @jeremycorbyn Absolutely right. She is a shocking PM, possibly worst in history. She has no concern for country as a whole, only her own hold on power and her paymasters. beginning to despair at what the state of our politics is, when PM triggers an article knowing Leave broke the law.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone else think  .@theresa_may is crappin it??  She's bleating on about  .@UKLabour party while at an EU summit discussing UK's future?🤨😂  Maybe it's time .@jeremycorbyn finally did the right thing &amp; made the switch to back a #PeoplesVote   #StopBrexit #FBPE #ToriesOut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonJHunter @Nigel_Farage Nigel doing what nigel does best - losing another conversation, cut off the caller! 🙄🤦🏻‍♂️ You absolutely schooled him 👏🏼👍🏼 He is weak and all he has is his 'shouty-shouty-hoity-toity' technique<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@theresa_may #VoteLeave broke Laws - FACT. You initiated art50 KNOWING they had. A REAL leader would've put on hold whilst investigations finished.

<|startoftext|>@VictoriaLIVE He hasn't got a flippin clue! 🤬🤬 The guy asked him a question and just as politicians do, he gave an answer to a different question altogether!! WTF. Standard for Redwood the loser.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of all current leaders, he's only one who can do anything IF he overcomes his personal desire &amp; 'will of the people' BS #brexit is a disaster that has already started and about to drastically affect many Labour members.

<|startoftext|>@robmchisholm @lpannett @JuliaHB1 Can you explain where we voted for your options a. or b. in Ref &amp; Where was Canada+ on ballot paper? Didn't see it 🤔 PM talking terms but if none agreed on advisory Ref, won I may add by #Voteleave breaking laws, fall back position has to be stay as is, AS PER ORIGINAL CHOICE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like the Chief exec of JLR WASN'T making it up after all! Doesn't .@bernardjenkin feel/look/sound (delete accordingly) like a Flippin Tw*T!🤪😂 This is only the start &amp; it's gonna get alot worse if we stay on this course of #Brexit  Let's not. #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gavinesler @Sally_CF71 I just said same thing on another thread! 👏🏼👍🏼😂 He is an idiot.  One question and he would be made redundant.  Do you run a company that turns over billions and employs 10' of thousands?  No. Well shut up and sit down. His view means Zilch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCNormanS @BBCr4today 😂🤣😂 Right, so guy who runs business with t/o of BILLIONS &amp; employs THOUSANDS is making it up. Yet .@bernardjenkin, who doesn't, says there's lots of possibilities but with no detail except rainbows &amp; unicorns after 29th Mar, isn't 🤨🤪 #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote #BrexitShambles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RebetikoWalrus @Keir_Starmer @amateurebutter I like Keir but think he's confused. On one hand wants to be loyal to leadership, same script etc. On other, he can see what a clustermuck #Brexit is &amp; WILL BE for everyone, especially #Labour voting areas. At some point, VERY SOON, he has to break rank #stopbrexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ajmpolite Gove = Tw*t 1. who would vote in 2nd ref? VOTERS!! 2. How can WE 'frustrate will of the voters'?  It'd be all 'the voters' who'd be voting, thereby if 'the voters' truly want Brexit based on new info,, then majority of 'the voters' would vote that way again. Not hard really<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TeamGGG .@GGGBoxing  Unlucky champ. You won &amp; most fans &amp; pundits know this.  Great fight, toughest opponent but he just didn't do enough to snatch titles.

<|startoftext|>#GGGCanelo #CaneloGGG2  After a sleep, still same. #TeamGGG won, #TeamCanelo didn't do enough 'clearly' to rip belts from #GGG. Champ always afforded that. Look through history. It was close but #Canelo did not win. 8yrs as Champ  .@GGGBoxing deserved more respect 👊🏼👍🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ToryFibs 👏🏼👏🏼 Flippin eck, He's changed his tune!😂 That actually sounds like more of what they should have been saying a long, long time ago.  Maybe it's got something bro do with up coming conference and the unions calling for a #PeoplesVote 🤔😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TeamGGG .@GGGBoxing  #GGGCanelo #CaneloGGG2  Unlucky Champ, You won that by 2-3 rounds. Need to rematch ASAP and put this wrong right. But next time, don't go #LasVegas, make it #NYC or even #London  Anywhere else and .@GoldenBoyBoxing can't buy it 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stephenasmith @Canelo @GGGBoxing Triple G by 3 for me. In 2 fights he's won on only one judges scorecard🤨🤔 Not hating on Canelo, great fighter, was close fight. Reality?

<|startoftext|>.@mrdavidhaye respect you but honestly, u got this wrong. Yes was close but G had that by at least 2. Was busier boxer throughout even compubox says had more scoring shots.

<|startoftext|>#CaneloGGG2 In 2 fights, between 6 judges, Golovkin only won on one card🤨 Do me a favour!!🤬 Feel for him. He got skanked.  Rematch in NY, then let's see if De la Hoya / Golden Boy can buy the decision<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LennoxLewis In 2 fights between 6 judges  Golovkin only won on one card.  Please explain<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>.@theresa_may thinks Russia's  #Skripal take 'Insults intelligence of Public' Really?

Either He knew #Brexit would be disaster &amp; didn't do enough to convince them, Or couldn't handle it &amp; let it be. It's On His Watch #FBPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandomThawt @Dan010173 Every time see this picture, just want to hurl on him🤦🏻‍♂️🤬  Still don't understand why any Labour heartlands would vote against its party, which stands for workers, to protest Govt austerity &amp; other LIES by vote Leave/LeaveEU?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@viralbunny @The_Flaneur16 @Willo96089252 @DanW9 @SteveAUK2 @BorisJohnson MASSIVE consequences.  The impact assessments APPARENTLY say this but seems  everyone is either ignoring or STILL calling it project fear 🤦🏻‍♂️  Happening now or about to. And it will affect jobs businesses industry. Not fear. REALITY.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viralbunny @The_Flaneur16 @Willo96089252 @DanW9 @SteveAUK2 @BorisJohnson You're right, parcels won't stop coming.

<|startoftext|>@theresa_may And I'll add, some of those involved with #VoteLeave sit in your cabinet. What does that say about you as PM? It's ok to fiddle the law. I don't agree with brexit or your leadership, but if you sacked all those involved IMMEDIATELY report came out,  you'd definitely look better<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theresa_may You really are going crazy. #VoteLeaveBrokeTheLaw I'll say it again #VoteLeaveBrokeTheLaw  By definition, regardless of outcome, it was ACHIEVED ILLEGALLY. Therefore not the will of the people, rather will of those that BROKE THE LAW. Does the LAW not mean ANYTHING now PM?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A shocking travesty ☹️😔  #StopBrexit #FBPE  https://t.co/1sAQ8CMbMe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisinsilico I for one don't understand what has to happen or be said for anyone to actually stand up and tell it like it is. WHOLE THING IS FUBAR. The Law is the Law.  It was KNOWINGLY broken, not mistakenly, which makes 10 times worse. And some of those involved are STILL ministers. Why??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jacob_Rees_Mogg May be multi millionaire, have title, or whatever, but let's be clear. Your MAIN interest in #Brexit is to avoid EU Tax directive, applies from 2019. Funnliy enough, is aimed at Co such yours who use tax havens. Out of EU = no jurisdiction = tax avoidance ahoy #StopBrexit #FBPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jacob_Rees_Mogg What on earth are you talking about??🧐 Heard better speeches in changing room down my old cricket club!!  I suppose it means nothing that he was on committee of campaign that BROKE THE LAW - UNDER HIS NOSE.  Or this week he broke ministerial rules. Fine example he is 🤪😂😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DanW9 @SteveAUK2 @BorisJohnson Costs go up or parcels delayed,  sales will drop, customers not happy &amp; business lost.

UNICORN DREAMS   #FBPE #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanW9 @SteveAUK2 @BorisJohnson They can't grasp this simple fact.  TWO MILLION PARCELS a day come to UK from EU. No delay, No problems, seamless. I receive deliveries from Germany, Next Day, no issue, no delay. Brextremists have not proposed ANYTHING that will NOT cause delay or increase cost. Who wants that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanW9 @SteveAUK2 @BorisJohnson 👍🏼👍🏼😂😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ste_wwfc89 @barrythesmith @sjharley @freespirited_p @Anna_Soubry ERG??😂😂 SHYSTERS only interested in ending EU rule for one purpose - TAX AVOIDANCE.

<|startoftext|>@barrythesmith @sjharley @Ste_wwfc89 @freespirited_p @Anna_Soubry Project fear?? 😂 More like project reality.   Answer this. Tell me how you intend to clear TWO MILLION parcels PER DAY to UK from EU when there's no vat / customs arrangement🤔 Each parcel will have to have vat calculated and paid before it can move forward. TWO MILLION A DAY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ste_wwfc89 @barrythesmith @sjharley @freespirited_p @Anna_Soubry They didn't threaten, IT'S A FACT.  If we have no deal, WTO rules state (not EU) we MUST have a hard border with other countries. WTO rules. Look it up.  Thetefore Leave with no deal  = hard order = no GFA 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PsychFarmer @Macca_Rants @Fixed_that_4_U @jeremycorbyn Did his duty = went with side he 'thought' would win😂 He'd only been leader for 4-5 months when Ref announced &amp; Labour was majority pro-EU.

<|startoftext|>@PsychFarmer @Macca_Rants @Fixed_that_4_U @jeremycorbyn C'MON, making his MPs abstain, instead of objecting, is opposing is it?? 😕🤦🏻‍♂️😂 Jokes aside, its true remainers have some issues with EU - they're far from perfect - but defo not as bad as made out &amp; certainly not worse than what is being proposed now by Tories.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@spayrechaynge @Macca_Rants @Fixed_that_4_U @jeremycorbyn How if not legally binding, but advisory?  By all accounts the impact assessments stated leaving will be catastrophic. So surely they (MPs) should have taken that on board and made a judgement based on what's BEST for country, not a 'will' position?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spayrechaynge @Macca_Rants @Fixed_that_4_U @jeremycorbyn Oh he definitely has. Many times. Just look for it on twitter and you'll see<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spayrechaynge @Macca_Rants @Fixed_that_4_U @jeremycorbyn The problem was no one heard them 😂  I agree re the Tory top two, but all they were saying was is what will happen if we drop out.

<|startoftext|>@spayrechaynge @Macca_Rants @Fixed_that_4_U @jeremycorbyn Appreciate that but just don't think JC has shown anything that makes us think he's Remain, even after 'campaigned' for it.

<|startoftext|>@Femi_Sorry @GlastoDadDancer Let's play this out for a second. #May and #Corbyn carry on with brexit, police investigate and find Gove, Johnson and other leave big wigs guilty. THEN WHAT? Do we STILL carry on with brexit, Or will it be too late as we're half in-half out?   It has to be stopped now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Femi_Sorry @GlastoDadDancer Actually It should be voided and then either re-run, with the new REAL facts or abandoned.  #VoteLeaveBrokeTheLaw #FBPE #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PIGTROUGH10 @CorbynistaTeen Absolutely. Both sides were cynical, but seems one crossed the line or rather, broke the law 😉 Remain was about fear, but reality is that is what will happen. They just said will be quicker, but it still stands. We are on the cliff edge. Do we jump, or say no, let's re-evaluate?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tanzley1 @Macca_Rants @Fixed_that_4_U @jeremycorbyn You're gonna say JC 🙄 Well hardly saw him on TV &amp; defo didn't see him on same platform as Cameron. If both major party leaders on same stage saying same thing, Leave would not have won. He was half hearted, AT BEST. Maybe 35yrs anti-EU in HoC had something to do with that 🤔😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PIGTROUGH10 @CorbynistaTeen 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️😵😵😵<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PIGTROUGH10 @CorbynistaTeen Exactly. They didn't. We were lied to and manipulated. And what's sad is that some leavers don't want to admit they've been duped.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PIGTROUGH10 @CorbynistaTeen I'm worried too. But maybe that's what JC wants. 00's of thousands of jobs will go. Already started. People out of work =pressure on services= people mad at Govt = election = he might win. That's why think he might be playing long game to win. But it'll be disaster in meantime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PIGTROUGH10 @CorbynistaTeen Not tricky now. Vote leave broke the law 😉 He's been handed the narrative ON A PLATE. He has to use it. The leave ref campaign was carried out with illegal activity - PROVEN - which they won. How can the result stand?? And we have the mess that is negotiations 🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Macca_Rants @Fixed_that_4_U @jeremycorbyn I agree. My hatred for all things Tory, ERG etc. is v well known 😉 my point is brexit going to hit labour heartlands very badly, he knows this yet doesn't campaign against that, rather he's indifferent. He 100% knows the Ref took place on illegality / lie, what's he gonna do??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dalancro @claaxton @__Wanno__ @Femi_Sorry @Nigel_Farage Have a look at the EU rules, says it in there 😉 the fact that UK govt chooses NOT to follow through is the issue, not that we can't.

<|startoftext|>@patacusack What are you talking about?? Yes the Tories are a shower of **** and need replacing but if JC really cares about people, human rights, workers rights, why would he want out of EU, which is ALL ABOUT THOSE THINGS!!?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tescgreen @voiceofbramley @davidagoodland Huge progress?? How so. Lost the last election, The #Tories are ALL OVER THE PLACE these last 12 months and yet .@jeremycorbyn &amp; .@UKLabour are so off the pace in the polls it's scary. Should be 5-10pts UP, not DOWN!! That's the reality<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@claaxton @__Wanno__ @Femi_Sorry @Nigel_Farage Pt 2 Doesn't attend committee meetings HE'S ON as MEP but STILL gets paid, then calls them names. Fights for #Leave but gets German passports for family to keep benefits. Knew Leave would win on night but pretends lost so could play markets &amp; make money. WHAT'S TO BE ADMIRED?🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@claaxton @__Wanno__ @Femi_Sorry @Nigel_Farage He is not to be admired in any way, shape or form. A SHYSTER HYPOCRITE. Few examples. Gives speeches at far right fascist rallies in Europe then claims to be Patriotic. LIES to public on regular basis - we can control EU immigration now but he says we can't. I can go on and on...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mc_gregor12 @theresa_may As I say, if is pretty much what we have now, then may be a way. But then what's point?? 1.Wasted 💯 millions which could have been spent elsewhere (#NHS ?) 2. Being Out in Name Only. Why bother &amp; not have a say? 3. Did anyone notice #VoteLeave broke the Law? Being ignored. Why?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More importantly, then what?🤨 I see civil war and I'm not talking about #CaptainAmerica   #FBPE #brexitshambles #StopBrexitSaveBritain  .@MarieAnnUK .@BrexitBin .@dontbrexitfixit .@nw_nicholas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #Tory Cabinet have an agreement - allegedly. Now all .@theresa_may needs to do is take this to the EU negotiators for them to say 'NON' and 'this looks in parts what you have now, why waste 2yrs &amp; have no say??' 😕🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️  #FBPE #StopBrexit #Brexit #Chequers<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Media_schmedia Who knows 🤷🏻‍♂️   people there don't actually CARE what he's saying, they're just happy to be there (celeb culture) And because isn't pre-scripted, he's just being 'himself' &amp; talking non-stop BS. His advisors will want to bury this video 🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 Did it make a difference to the result? Irrelevant. Fact is #Leave BROKE THE LAW, tried to CHEAT &amp; CON the system and have been caught doing so.  If you continue to support #Leave as of now, by definition it means you are backing an  ILLEGALLY OBTAINED RESULT.   #FBPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 Why? decisions can be looked at by Ref/Umps &amp; OVERTURNED, ESPECIALLY when players try to  cheat. The FA also have post match process to look at something ref may have missed. Therefore the Electoral commission review taken place &amp; said #Leave CHEATED &amp; tried to CON THE REF #FBPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 Thing is, to people like Julia it's all about result. Leave won, that's that, Get over it. Slight problem, now been proven Leave BROKE THE LAW &amp; CHEATED😕  Funny that Julia should use football as example for referendum result They now use VAR, as do rugby, cricket &amp; tennis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 'Blah blah blah, look at me, my name's Julia, I'm trying to be clever by comparing a penalty shootout to the referendum' 🙄🙄🙄 WHAT. THE. ACTUAL. PATHETICNESS. To think someone somewhere is actually paying you to talk crap like this for a living 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️ #FBPE<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@The_UnSilent_ @realDonaldTrump 😳😳😳😳🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪😵😵😵😵<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tripletreefarm @Koloholic Absolutely. That very moment was where this game was lost. Karius gets checked, probably goes off, Migs comes on and who knows. Saying that, Migs has been known to drop a clanger or two, so...😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBeeston_ @Nabyllionaire @Kloppholic Maybe it just me, but seems Ramos is doing the wrapping 🤔😉😂  https://t.co/8qJVBDXc0d<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kloppholic @ClinicalFirmino @VintageSalah You're wrong to assume we'd all celebrate, and I wouldn't want a arrogant git like him as Capt. Yes we need a better mentality (it's improving) but I think, Mo,  Firmino, VVD &amp; Mane have shown you don't need to. Same goes for Oxo. Keita &amp; Fabinho will def bring a new vibe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kloppholic He's a tw🤬t &amp; not just cause of what happened in final. Winning mentality is a Must, but at ALL costs? Not even Klopp wants that. Personally always hated his sh🤬thousery. Way takes Messi out every time is disgraceful. Can't respect that no matter how much won, like Roy Keane<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irontimes @RobRLFC Lol nice. You guys should be used to sucking that 😉😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RyanBrunyee I agree - we go again👍🏼 But the person who's got concussion can never know, that's what medics say. Was up to refs to stop, who sadly, ALL 6 OF, were oblivous too an elbow to the head 🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanBrunyee You're right, not an excuse, it's medical reason.  Yes we lost &amp; may have lost anyhow, but asks v good question. Would he have rolled that ball to Benzema, if he had full spatial awareness, 2 mins after elbow to head from Ramos? personally i doubt it, but It is what it is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vincent_ino @GrizzKhan Can't change that game now, done&amp; dusted, but something that authorities need to look at going forward<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vincent_ino @GrizzKhan Lol ALL GK's make errors most games, some big, mostly minor. Never said LK long term. simply saying, no elbow, THOSE most likely don't happen, esp 1st, so soon after. 'Spatial' awareness was iffy, what concussion does. Refs at fault. Physio checks him, Migs prob comes on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vincent_ino @GrizzKhan TWO mistakes, in SAME game, both AFTER elbow to head &amp; you say not out of character?🤨 glad you're not my Doc 😳😂  Said just after elbow, he doesn't look right. And now we know. Was LK good enough at time? Yes. Would I buy Oblak/AN OTHER long term? think we were anyway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LFCFansCorner 3. If they had, Physio would've checked &amp; prob subbed, Migs would have come on &amp; who knows.  NOT AN EXCUSE, this is reality of situation. RM may have still won. As is, LK made two errors &amp; We'll never know if it was him, or the blow to the head.  #LFC #YNWA @LorisKarius @LFC 2/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LFCFansCorner REFFING ISSUE. @UEFA @ChampionsLeague have to look at to make sure doesn't happen again. Ref/Linos should have seen incident &amp; stopped game. 1. WHY didn't they, WHAT are looking at, especially guy on by-line? 2. LK complained to ref Ramos elbowed in head, WHY did ignore him? 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kapaibro @LFCFansCorner Absolutely. The ref essentially ignored Karius, who was telling him he'd been elbowed in head. Seems Refs are trained to think players are cynical (most are) &amp; are trying to get another guy in trouble. as soon as he pointed to his head, the ref should have stopped the game<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@reinford35 @LorisKarius @SergioRamos @empireofthekop @AYPrivateEye I agree. He may not be the answer long term but if that twat Ramos didn't do what he did, then whos to say he would have rolled the ball to Benzema like he did, or if he'd gone off and migs comes on, who knows?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AYPrivateEye @LorisKarius @SergioRamos @empireofthekop Still can't understand how everyone missed the actual incident and then his concussion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AYPrivateEye @LorisKarius @SergioRamos @empireofthekop This news doesn't surprise me. Doesn't make him a world beater or anything, but may go some way to explaining why wasn't spatially aware of Benzema, or even maybe the ball in flight from Bale. Yes all academic but I actually said it to my lad at the time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AYPrivateEye @LorisKarius @SergioRamos @empireofthekop No, sorry, not saying you were mate. Just tagging you 😉👍🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All people who were calling for @LorisKarius head after final - hang your heads in shame😯😔 Proven now he had concussion &amp; wasn't totally there The person who SHOULD have been getting your wrath was that cheating 🤬 @SergioRamos 😡😠😤 #LFC #YNWA  @empireofthekop @AYPrivateEye<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>.@Benzema you're right, was not lucky - THE KEEPER HAD CONCUSSION!!🤪😵 taking credit for a goal when Karius NOT in his senses &amp; GIVING YOU THE BALL!?!  desperate🙄🤦🏼‍♂️  All because of that cheating shyster @SergioRamos 🤬  Chin up @LorisKarius 👍🏼 #LFC #YNWA #liverpoolfc<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jshopson Let's see how it plays out. To me, Labour would go for a customs union pretty much same as is now, but simply re-title it.  They KNOW it's the ONLY logical way forward but are too afraid to admit it publicy, for fear of betraying the labour leave vote. That's the REAL reason<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bakehouse2016 He doesn't give two fooks. Everything he says his BS.  He's only interested in getting out from EU laws so him and his pals can do what they like with Tax avoidance and investments.  Smoke &amp; mirrors<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jshopson I don't know if anyone's noticed but most of UK industry is saying we need to stay in current version of CU or there will be massive issues, leading to losses and businesses closing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jshopson It just sounds so pathetically childish (not you. them saying it)  There's already 'a' custons union but we now want 'a' different customs union. WHAT?!?🤨😳 EU have said No so even if Lab did get in (doubt it) it's v unlikely they're going to change their minds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jshopson Definitely DO NOT rely on lib Dems !😂 unfortunately that's the prob, their brexit is virtually no different to TM's, just worded differently. eg Lab ' we'll have a new customs arrangement' -  that's what Tories are saying! And EU have said - it's this CU or non<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jshopson Fully aware Lol That's the irony. Labour talk as if they're already in power! Was just pointing out that Starmer is clutching at straws, PR to make them look diff to Tories, when it's clear for all to see, they're actually saying same thing - Just in Red<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ignaciosouviron @interpolusa Now you're showing you're true colours. If all else fails, let's just show off. Typical Real Madrid 🙄 Exactly why you're the most hated club in the world - along with Man utd. I'm really hoping we get Real in the group stages next season 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Doozy_45 @nigelmp @faisalislam Lol 'we are leaving' Really, where are you going? More importantly, who's we?  Pls come back with better than 'will of people'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ignaciosouviron @interpolusa Don't be daft! he did the back heel and his hamstring went. You really are desperate to balance this debate 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ignaciosouviron @interpolusa @UltraAutistic I'm not crying, we LFC fans know what happened. 2 Massive mistakes by our GK = gifts, and a great goal by Bale.  I know for 30mins RM did not know what to do. Then Salah is fouled and the game changes. Eso es vida<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kloppholic Not being funny, I love VvD, but whys he in? And Rodriguez?? This is literally someone hand picking his fave players.  Clearly not watching matches<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ignaciosouviron @interpolusa @UltraAutistic Paul Scholes is ex-Man United, who HATES Liverpool, why would I listen to him??😂 It's like me telling you to listen to Pique!

<|startoftext|>@TheRedRoar He's a SHYSTER.  Chipping away at both ends,  doesn't give two hoots about average Joe, only interested in JRM &amp; co.  #ReesMoggShyster  #StopBrexitSaveBritain #FBPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ignaciosouviron @interpolusa @UltraAutistic Of course that was an innocent tackle🙄 #Ramos has had 24 red cards in his Real Madrid career, 4 in first season. Another Record he holds is most SENT-OFF player in La Liga HISTORY, with 19 league dismissals and 24 in total.  Says it all really 😎  https://t.co/JHZ4hXMcFZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ignaciosouviron @interpolusa @UltraAutistic Ramos is a cheat, you support a cheat, THAT'S the reality 😂 He knew Salah was main man &amp; was his instruction, take him out. Also elbowed GK in face. SR could have 500 trophies, doesn't make difference - always cheating tactics.  Sad but true<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ignaciosouviron @interpolusa @UltraAutistic And THIS is Sergio Ramos the cheat.  Amazing how he can multitask - Be a Capt, Twat AND cheat! But hey, if that's how you Real fans roll...  Ps. No need to reply. We gave you 2 gifts already. Also Messi says hi from Top of La Liga 😉  https://t.co/fOLdKxssAJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomLondon6 Yeah you're right, world has changed, but at same time, country doesn't need to go back to pre 90's Labour protester politics. This current #Tory govt so shambolic in virtually every aspect (#windrush, #Grenfell, #Brexit talks) yet JC can't seem to make any headway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VintageSalah @Kloppholic #Klopp needs to look at why our last 3 GK's had issues. Pepe, Migs &amp; now Karius, all had problems. Common factor? John Achterberg. Can't believe all 3 are  bad. Pepe done fine at Napoli since left &amp; still makes Spainish Squad. Getting new GK pointless if working with same coach<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigelrefowens It's a good idea in principle but the bigger picture is #Uefa is in on it. How can the ref be so blind to this, especially as he's got line of sight? Then what about the one where Ramos, all alone, elbows Karius in the head in the 6yd box?  Is the by line official blind too??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rawan Sergio Ramos getting his nomination for an Oscar in early. #ramos #salah #LFC #YNWA @TheRedmenTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rawan Cheating TW*T.  Makes me cringe that Real Madrid fans are ACTUALLY PROUD of this cheat 😵 He could have 20 CL cups, everyone except RM fans know he's a cheat. End of.  But I suppose with manager like Zidane (headbutt?) anything goes, eh .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going back &amp; 'renegotiating' is to appease Leave. But it's too late.

<|startoftext|>@stehoare Sorry would never applaud shithouseness. Desire to win, yes, but not at all costs. That is known as cheating. Even when Suarez was up to that kinda stuff I was like 'cut it out mate'. We got to final without doing that kinda stuff &amp; more than held our own. Why change?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThePaulMachin Agreed 👍🏼 Point to add. #Ramos is a tw*t, pure &amp; simple, &amp; not just for dragging Mo down, which is cynical as you can get. Tried to get Mané booked at every opportunity plus elbowed Karius in head for no reason just before 1st. Defo Red. What are byline officials watching??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaddockMirror Ramos is and always will be a cheating b*st*rd. pulled Mo to the floor,  elbowed Karius in the head 2 mins before the first goal, feigned injury when Mané didn't touch him, trying to get him booked.  And he didn't get penalised for anything at all. This is the face of a cheat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SergioRamos  just wanted to remind you that you're a cheating bastard.  Always are, always have been, always will be. You can have all the trophies you want but your just a cheat. Oh and Messi makes you looks tw*t  #UCLfinal #LFC #YNWA #UCLFinal2018<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WTF ARE BEHIND GOAL OFFICIALS LOOKING AT???🤬🤬 This is a clear Red.

<|startoftext|>Not once did we get ripped by Ronaldo.  We lost that on 2 points. 1. when Mo went off by a cynical challenge by Ramos.  2. We didn't have quality in depth.  I love LFC and always will. This is just the beginning for Klopp &amp; co  #YNWA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#LFC #UCLfinal  just me but Real Madrid were crap tonight. 1st goal, premier league that's given as obstruction. 2nd, clips LFC player on way to bale, who doesn't get best purchase but still scores. 3rd obviously Karius misjudged power and deflects in.<|endoftext|>

Go ask in a Tory area. See what they say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeJoyce_1  Superb performance tonight 👏🏼👏🏼👊🏼 Now for Chisora, Bellew and then the big one - AJ.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bucks87 @BronzeBomber @Tyson_Fury @andreward 'I'll fight anyone, BUT not these big lads.' that's not anyone then is it!! He's not even took on a CW. Won title, defended once. Jack, Stevenson, Kovalev or the CW's - he comes undone. Lets be honest. fought a finished Haye TWICE, purely for financial reasons. Mugged everyone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BellewHaye2 don't know much but know FOR SURE @JoeJoyce_1  would absolutely flatten @TonyBellew  😂😂 @EddieHearn knows it too.  In a year or so, #JoeJoyce would be an absolute nightmare for his golden egg @anthonyfjoshua<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't stand this BS. Bellew - good fighter, not world class.  Put him against any of #DillanWhyte @BronzeBomber #Parker #Povetkin and especially @Tyson_Fury he loses BIG TIME!  All talk. Beating a BROKEN Haye is nothing to be proud of.  And calling out @andreward ??  Embarrassing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BellewHaye2  @TonyBellew was injured (del boy let it slip) &amp; seems @mrdavidhaye was too, was v cagey about it in interview. Bellew don't half talk crap.  Says will fight anyone - but in same sentence won't fight these lads (Sky sports chums) so basically won't fight anyone!🤨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't stand ove in with TB. good but ain't world class. Who's TB beat? A broken man twice🤨 This was a money making exercise for both fighters, plus #EddieHearn . Bottom line? when talk REAL fights - Dillian, AJ, Parker, he sh*ts himself &amp; calls out ANOTHER retired fighter!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BellewHaye2 Gutted for @mrdavidhaye 1st 2 Rnds boxed nice, good jab, even some bombs. Not sure what happened in 3rd, dropped his hands (got cocky?) Bellew clipped him &amp; legs went. Very strange. Rode out 4th, again looked back in 5th till they both swung away, DH missed, TB hit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BellewHaye2  WHY would @andreward want to comenout of retirement and fight @TonyBellew ?? What does Bellew bring to the table, apart from  #EddieHearn's money? Nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BellewHaye2  Bellew won well but this whole love in on #Sky is really annoying and grating. Sickly 🤢 Hayes legs gone. Can't recover, time to call it a day. Joe Joyce would flatten Bellew<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BellewHaye2  What is with froch and Smiths biased commentary?? So far up Eddie's arse it's unreal there's no light<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gtr910 I agree. clearly internal politics not helping, has to be unity. But same when JC &amp; co were backbenchers too. they were minority then, now old 'new' labour lot are.  As much as I see JC as decent man, very much doubt he will EVER convince Tories to vote for him in GE = can't win<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>REALITY CHECK. #JeremyCorbyn does NOT appeal to #Tory voters. NEVER WILL. Haven't met one who says they would vote for him.

<|startoftext|>@spayrechaynge @edwardpoole1975 @xpressanny @GreatRedDragon0 @UKLabour Yes, they were the ones David Davis' team knocked up overnight - off Google 😉 The 2nd lot have not been made public if I recall. These are the ones that paint the truer picture of Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edwardpoole1975 @spayrechaynge @xpressanny @GreatRedDragon0 @UKLabour Really? Clearly Not loud enough 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spayrechaynge @edwardpoole1975 @xpressanny @GreatRedDragon0 @UKLabour The ref was advisory, not mandatory. THAT right was problem. Both sides made it be all &amp; end all. Iwasn't meant to be. And now new info coming to light, stating Brexit is bad. Very bad. Any sane politician who has countries welfare at heart (not own) would look at that &amp; act, no?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spayrechaynge @edwardpoole1975 @xpressanny @GreatRedDragon0 @UKLabour Or maybe, if info from the impact assessments was released &amp; we (the public) got told what is REALLY gonna happen, maybe, just maybe, Labour could make an opposite case IN parliament &amp; oppose Brexit properly. If JC is so good, why doesn't he? What's he scared of?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xpressanny @GreatRedDragon0 @UKLabour Typical Corbynista. Can't have a debate based on facts. If you see my previous tweet, I said I'm a red, not right or left, but its clear as day this is not working. Lest we forget, we lost last election AND Now Tories are powering on unchecked. But yeah, let's ra-ra for JC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xpressanny @edwardpoole1975 @GreatRedDragon0 @UKLabour I can. JC will not win over hardcore Tories. I'm a realist, Not a blind Loyalist. For the record, I'm a red. I'm not a Blairite &amp; I'm not left wing. But the worst Tory govt on recent record yet a Labour leadership team that cannot effectively put them down is scary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edwardpoole1975 @xpressanny @GreatRedDragon0 @UKLabour Here's the thing, I WANT Labour to do well. If JC has integrity like we all think he has, why let this go on? He KNOWS Brexit is bad (impact assessments) jobs already lost  &amp; will continue to if we carry on. HE CAN &amp; NEEDS to make an alternative case before it's too late<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xpressanny @GreatRedDragon0 @UKLabour Want me to believe a man, who for 30 yrs anti EU, suddenly decides he's Remain (PR - to stay on winning side) THEN when Leave wins (which he's loving) starts spouting 'will of people' &amp; goes all out! B*llocks to Tories, JC &amp; co KNOW Brexit Will be harmful, yet carry on regardless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xpressanny @edwardpoole1975 @GreatRedDragon0 @UKLabour Labour are all over the place. Take off the red tinted glasses for a sec. The polls (even Lab friendly ones) show that Lab are BEHIND THIS!! Tory Govt, the worst ANYONE can remember.  WHY. IS. THAT??   Leadership?  Front bench?   Brexit? Or ALL OF THE ABOVE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edwardpoole1975 @GreatRedDragon0 @UKLabour I wish I could tweet that fast 😂 Have a good day 😉👍🏼  Ps I save real insults for Tories 😉<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GreatRedDragon0 @UKLabour Of 600k Lab members (62% voted JC) been said that over 70% want to stay in SM / CU - no Brexit. So wondering how come these people are being IGNORED &amp; he's effectively backing Tories on Brexit, now that he's Leader? 🤔  And pls Don't say 'will of people' as that would be ironic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afneil Andrew, not sure if you're being serious or sarcastic 🤔🤨😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidLammy Probably written by Rees-Mogg or IDS 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sajidjavid Japan's amb says Nissan, Honda, Toyota factories will move to mainland if we leave SM/CU. Jobs lost, families poorer, economy suffers.

<|startoftext|>@RaheemKassam country voted to make itself poorer?? Of course it did! 😂 They said eff the EU, we want to lose our jobs as factories &amp; offices close &amp; relocate across channel.

<|startoftext|>@GeorgeFeltham Re old new labour, think you'll find it was the GLOBAL economic crisis and affected most western countries, so to say was them alone is incorrect.

<|startoftext|>@Mathewdcx @Rachael_Swindon @jeremycorbyn @UKLabour That may well be right / true, but this is HUGE. Bizarrely one that both major parties are conveniently ignoring 🤨 Could it be they KNOW it DID happen &amp; unfairly &amp; illegally affected yhe outcome🤔 Which, if proven, implies wasn't democratic, even though we want to think it was<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mathewdcx @Rachael_Swindon @jeremycorbyn @UKLabour Democratic vote? Lol  You mean one illegally manipulated by #CambridgeAnalytica or illegally funded Leave campaigns?

<|startoftext|>#LFC #WBALIV  Absolutely brilliant by @IngsDanny 👏🏼👏🏼👍🏼👍🏼 So happy for you dude 👍🏼  #YNWA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rachael_Swindon I respect your views on most things and retweet most as well but you can't ignore what's going on in Sunderland Nissan plant.  @jeremycorbyn said not one job will be lost. He was right. It's 300.  As long as @UKLabour keeps up this brexit stance this will sadly happen more &amp; more<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbcnewcastle @Nissan I feel extremely sorry for those who will suffer 😔 Many #Leavers are stubbornly holding  https://t.co/s907sntj0Y some fantasy Reality?

<|startoftext|>@bbcnewcastle @Nissan @jeremycorbyn so much for not losing one job on your watch, eh? Shambles.

<|startoftext|>@CharlieHicks90 @cakeisverygood @afneil Based on life &amp; business experience. You don't have to believe me. But I've been 'fortunate' to have worked in organisations where been around lots of 'Priti Patel' types. Look the part, come across nice, even sound it, but substance is lacking. She reminds me of a HR manager<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharlieHicks90 @cakeisverygood @afneil Cool. Not disrespecting Henley or anything 😉 but come ask any member of General public in the North what they think of when you say Henley and you'd understand 😄 Back to Priti - that's what they do. they're all in it for themselves. You, me - they couldn't give two hoots about<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharlieHicks90 @cakeisverygood @afneil But meeting her for a few mins over a drink at Henley doesn't qualify as being 'very good' around general public😂 Just saying words 'Fête'and 'Henley' says it all!! 😂😂  To me, comes across as conniving, biding her time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharlieHicks90 @cakeisverygood @afneil 99% of what we see of them IS on TV, unless they're in your constituency or you know them personally. So perception is what they create on the box, social media, papers etc. Undoubtedly she is liked by influential people, clearly they want her to sit tight till the time is right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharlieHicks90 @cakeisverygood @afneil Priti Patel, to all intents and purposes, is heartless and dare I say it (I dare) clueless. She is just another cogg in the machine, Cameron-lite. Not sure about witch hunt, she lied and didn't disclose what she was up to. To me that is clear as day. MPs have to be transparent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ToryFibs Putting MSM aside, put that down to not very competent social media team. I mean, yesterday, across all people I follow &amp; then who they follow, didn't see ONE tweet about this. Why?? clearly not good enough. @UKLabour need to sack them ASAP &amp; get new team. MSM can be bypassed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnprescott @FRANKADEMILLE Is ANYONE, with a sane mind, SURPRISED?? Lies, cheats, deceives, deflects, accuses, bombs...I could go on but I'm tired!  Looking back, John Major was awesome compared to this!!  The sooner she goes the better. The REALLY worrying thing though - the next lot are just as bad!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cakeisverygood @CharlieHicks90 @afneil got her on to add some pzazz &amp; glam. But in reality, it made me want portillo back ASAP! He's a Tory but at least he tries and put one side across in a balanced way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarieAnnUK Funny you should say that cause when he said I was like 'wth??'  He's clearly had too much wine again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hovis_Presley Not lie or deceives, but definitely acts crazy sometimes 😉😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharlieHicks90 If that's how you like em 😉 Being a friend of Israel isn't a question or issue. the fact that she had to LIE (again) when she went there though makes her look really stupid and cost her job. Obviously not a full box of screws<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#bbctw  Why is #PritiPatel on this show?? She just nods, lies, deceives, bullshits through everything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#bbctw #bbcqt #PeterHitchens talking absolute sense about #Syria  Sadly he's being shouted down by @afneil who's trying to discredit him. Reality is, PH's got a point. Why rush in to bomb when you've only got the word of terrorists in Douma? Talk about irony<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think this is what you're looking for #BBCQT  https://t.co/vmgd1pgRAb<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Straw that broke the camels back? 🐫 The SCANDAL &amp; COVER UP of #Windrush, surely enough to bring this #Tory Govt down?? ME THINKS SO.

<|startoftext|>@markpentler @COutwin @renireni @BBC Sometimes the evidence, is self evident 😉 No one sign posts these things but, it is VERY strange how the #Windrush scandal came to a head the very same week that it was broadcast 🤨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Read &amp; RT #TheresaMay's husband, a senior exec at financial services Co, that manages, £1.4 TRILLION &amp; is also largest shareholder in BAE systems, the company that supplied the missles for Syria bombings 🤨 Funny how that works🤔 #WednesdayWisdom   https://t.co/cUoy724bmZ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SheronWilkie @foshtown #Comey calls #Trump a mob boss. #Tories are more Mob boss types, only with posh accents &amp; sipping cups of tea.

<|startoftext|>@foshtown @SheronWilkie Unfortunately, she's holds the keys and she knows it. #TheresaMay is beholden to three people / groups 1. Trump 2. DUP / Foster 3.

<|startoftext|>And when they do happen to sneak on, like @carolecadwalla you just get another guest on to shout / shoot her down.  Time to stop playing kiss-ass service to your Tory viewers and bring back balance, in guests and style   #marr #bbcnews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes @AndrewMarr9 you may be Tory, &amp; yes you may be under orders from #BBC  bosses, but at least TRY make look neutral, not this biased rubbish week in-week out. programme is constantly full of Tory &amp; Brexit lovers, what about the other 48m people, who's representing them?  #marr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hello @AndrewMarr9  A simple question. Why do you allow Tory minister to come on your show &amp; blatantly lie, week after week?

<|startoftext|>@theresa_may how is it LEGAL to bomb ANOTHER SOVEREIGN COUNTRY, who's NOT threatened you, WITHOUT CONSENT of lawmakers ELECTED by public, to make such decisions??

<|startoftext|>@PIGTROUGH10 Fully agree. Where I live it'll be Labour, no matter what I vote so not a mega issue😂 But in areas where its so-so, people really need to think hard.  The brexit issue is much bigger than media is reporting. #Labour could capitalise big time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PIGTROUGH10 True but now more info coming to light ( #CambridgeAnalytica scandal) and all is not what it seems.Tory agenda for Brexit was clear.

<|startoftext|>@PIGTROUGH10 50-50 😐 want to, always have, but JC stance on brexit is wrong. seems good guy overall, potentially some good ideas but being out of EU not one them. On other hand #Tories are bar stewards as well!! If Labour came out say WHY brexit is bad (as all reports agree) he'd win easily<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet when comes to bombing #Syria we don't need to ask anyone, NOT PUBLIC, NOT PARLIAMENT. Just go ahead and bomb whoever we want, with NO FIRM EVIDENCE then will answer QUESTIONS 2 days later. WHAT. THE. FcUK!!??!! 🤬🤬🤬  #FBPE #StopBrexit #SyriaStrikes #NotInMyNameTheresaMay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We 'allow' public referendum for an issue that 95% of us will NEVER understand the complexities of. And once over, say 'will of the people' is more important than parliament, even though one of key factors for Leave was take back control FOR parliament.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>'Take back Control'  more like 'Give it over' UK could soon be 'United Countries of America'  What #TheresaMay did was to try make herself look in charge. Reality? By by-passing Parliament (again🤔) weakened our standing further. Worst PM?? #SyriaStrikes #Syria #FBPE #BREAKING<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robfree0 @EL4JC @alexnunns Who says we have? Our PM, the one that never lies or deceives anyone?? Do me a favour!!!  There's no evidence of chem attack apart from one dodgy video made by white helmets, who happens to be backed by us. If &amp; when the Russians retaliate, don't be surprised. They are pissed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😡🤬😡🤬 She is unbelievable, talking absolute bollocks. #TheresaMay really thinks we believe her concerns for #Syria when she shows NONE for #Yemen ?? No proof, no evidence, let's go!!  WTF!!😵🤬😡 It's all to create diversion from #CambridgeAnalytica &amp; #Brexit  #SyriaStrikes  https://t.co/IkvPcMCiHb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@10DowningStreet @theresa_may Where's evidence that 75 died? Cause British backed #WhiteHelmets 'told you'? Show British people evidence besides that one staged video ON REPEAT! of man pouring water over peoples head with a hose pipe. According to Doctors there, it didn't happen and yet 🤨 Disgraceful PM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterStefanovi2 It's all about Convenience and Hypocrisy Peter. Convenient that parliament is in recess till next week thereby allowing her to 'show her strength' when in fact she was told when. Hypocrisy as in there is not even slightest SAME concern for what is happening in Yemen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂😂😂😂 #SyriaStrikes #SyriaCrisis #Syria #Damascus  https://t.co/0uTVSNs9vW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #Russia responds to attacks as said will, fear the worst. #TheresaMay will be 100% responsible.  To call her stupid would be a complement  #syriastrikes #SyriaCrisis #Syria  #NotInMyName<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>USA UK France bomb Syria / Damascus. And at the same time, what's left of ISIS attacks south Damascus too.  Funny how that works 🤨🤨  #SyriaCrisis #Syria #syriastrikes #StopBrexit #NotInMyNameTheresaMay #NoWarWithSyria #NotInMyName<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheresaMay mantra  'Take back control' How the fcUK are we taking back control when she's waiting on  Dotard Trump to TELL HER WHAT TO DO???🤬😵🤬  #Syria #Russia #Douma #Brexit #FridayFeeling #StopBrexit #FBPE #FridayThe13th<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dontbrexitfixit I like that 👍🏼  Cactus = lots of tiny little pricks = #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sluce23 @tuckers35 @miamibyrne @GarethNuFc1722 @MarcBenamram Think it'd be fair to say each of us would have been asking for that if was our teams😂 but other way round, it was iffy and we'd be aggrieved. Not easy but maybe that's what VAR is needed for. Plus think it shouldn't be on-field ref, rather an off field, like they have in rugby<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sluce23 @tuckers35 @miamibyrne @GarethNuFc1722 @MarcBenamram Watching some matches, it defo looks fishy with some of the refs decisions, how easily players go down etc. Just look how many Betting Co. have got involved in game over last 10 years. Virtually every club has a link. And so much money at stake. It's plausible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sluce23 @tuckers35 @miamibyrne @GarethNuFc1722 @MarcBenamram Still is on first two! 😂😂 But so did many other greats.. Maradona, Ronaldo, Henry to name a few<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My thoughts exactly.  Same goes for #TheresaMay  Disgusting &amp; Despicable Hypocrisy by them all, not forgetting Shameless. #ThursdayThoughts #Syria #Yemen #NotInMyNameTheresaMay #FBPE  https://t.co/ZIm0EOaioc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BakhtoonK @realactionhank @mehdirhasan Unfortunately, Syria has been used as a play ground by various outside sources, only interested in the things I mentioned before.-  Oil, Land, Power. My heart aches for Syrian population, regardless of which side on. Just look at Libya, they did same there &amp; it is a total mess<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BakhtoonK @realactionhank @mehdirhasan You may be right, but as elected leader of his country, he has to defend it. That's his right. How he does it is questionable if proven true but the rebels have also killed many innocent people.  There are no internal winners in this civil war, only external ones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tell me @theresa_may  WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?? 💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷💷 THAT'S the difference!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ThursdayThoughts  if #TheresaMay goes bombing Syria, she will be BIGGEST HYPOCRITE &amp; have ZERO CREDIBILITY. Fake concern for unverified #ChemicalAttack in #Syria. Yet same time, backs #SaudiArabia supplying support &amp; weapons to Bomb #Yemen KILLING Innocents incl WOMEN &amp; CHILDREN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ThursdayThoughts I pray sense prevails &amp; we DO NOT go bombing Syria again.  Haven't we already caused enough grief in region with our proxy wars? What has fighting achieved? Misery, Death &amp; Biggest Humanitarian crisis EVER. Diplomacy &amp; Dialogue are ONLY SOLUTION #FBPE #Syria<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flythebike @tuckers35 @MarcBenamram The argument whether Kane touched it or not is daft and pointless. Spurs scored, won, 3 pts. If he's claiming that his hairline of hairline 'touches' made difference to divert the ball &amp; make it go in, then we really are entering silly season🙄 ps this is NOT anti-spurs /Kane<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yorkshirespurs @GarethNuFc1722 @tuckers35 @MarcBenamram What gets me is there is no mechanism to have Refs answer for their decisions. Other countries have Refs on TV after games. Here? Hidden away. If they're so confident in their decisions, What are they scared of??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yorkshirespurs @GarethNuFc1722 @tuckers35 @MarcBenamram Lads, you're all nit picking over wrong things. Take your club hat for a moment &amp; look at situations. It's not individuals but system that's aiding &amp; abetting.  Some of reffing these last seasons have been atrocious, or dubious at best. Ever wondered why? Millions 💷 at stake<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRealSpursWay @MarcBenamram Why are spurs fans so defensive?? Lol LFC bottled it in 2013-14.  There, make you feel better? 😉😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#VictoriaLive  These 2 Syrians who are advocating bombing clearly have a biased view. You're the opposition, ypu're gonna be p*ssed off!! If you  have surgical strikes, Russia WILL strike back. Then who's responsible for what follows?? Ridiculous. @VictoriaLIVE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@petertimmins3 Because that'd be the SENSIBLE &amp; RIGHT thing to do,. #Tory #Brexiteers  aren't going allow those words to come between them and their objective, namely get out so dont come under EU ANTI TAX AVOIDANCE INITIATIVE which kicks in, surprisingly, in 2019. Funny how that works 😳😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tuckers35 @MarcBenamram Oh I agree, he should and most probably will. I'm not a hater, on the contrary.  That's what's funny/daft about it, that he feels he need it sooo bad he has to bring his family into it! That's clearly Eriksen's goal. But hey ho🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tuckers35 @MarcBenamram Beats me. If you watch the video and are fair, he didn't touch it 🤷🏻‍♂️ I can only assume he's England's new golden boy (after Shearer) and 'want' him to win golden boot / beat his record.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcBenamram Like HK's gonna hang around when they bottle it Every. Single. Year. &amp; win nothing 😉😂  Jokes aside, to claim that by swearing on his daughters life, is embarrassing. JUST WATCH. Doesn't touch it. Don't need a panel, only need your eyes!!  #FakeNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertOnley @Harryslaststand Not defending Asad, pretty sure they've down some bad sh*t too, maybe even this attack, BUT, if you're president of country that is being overrun by western backed militants, who want Asad to fall at all costs, would you just let it happen? Or would you seek help &amp; fight back?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertOnley @Harryslaststand I agree in the most part but who says they have? western media?  That's the problem, Govts are using this as distraction. USA - Mueller probe, UK.- brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realactionhank @mehdirhasan It's said that Iran has 100 years worth of untapped oil.  Imagine getting your hands on that...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realactionhank @mehdirhasan Exactly. And over what?  Oil - rid Asad, put puppet in place, control oil fields. Land - Israel will take more of Syria and create greater Israel. Influence - Iran will be alone if Syria falls, thus allowing USA to think about that next. That's why Russia is the key in all this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TonyBlair talking war b*llocks - AGAIN!! The LAST PERSON in world who can lecture on going to bomb anyone!! Millions died cause of his lies &amp; now he wants to do it again?! Wonder what his agenda is this time🤔 #WarCriminal #Syria #Douma #Labour #StopBrexit #FBPE @georgegalloway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mehdirhasan If USA fires at Syrians, I can see Russia shooting them down. Then what? This is scenario that is playing out. Russia wil defend Syria as they've been ASKED to by the sovereign state. Like it or not, that's the reality.  Further lives are gonna be lost needlessly on both sides.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now, after 7 years of civil war, ISIS etc. everyone has a grown a conscience. Do me a favour!!?! Ultimately, this is and has always been about regime change. They (US, UK, Israel) want Asad out, weaken/finish an Iranian ally &amp; to take control of their oil fields.  @mrjamesob<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They're defo p*ss*d. Already lost most of Ghouta.Then, out of nowhere, a chlorine attack happens AGAIN, causing death of innocent adults &amp; children. INSTANTLY blamed on Syrian regime &amp; Russia.  How convenient🤨 #Labour #Tories #StopBrexit #EU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For those caught up in 'chemical attack killing children' spiel, remember this. Jaysh-al-Islam are the 'Rebels' in Douma, fighting Syrian Govt. They are Coalition of islamist  units involved in Syrian Civil War, backed by Saudi money, Supported by Western govts. #Syria #Douma<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>More hear about #ChemicalAttack more think deliberate act by someone other than #PresidentAsad . Innocent people needlessly dying, but Douma is a rebel area.

<|startoftext|>It's not about hate for JC, more an overall thing for the Labour party &amp; members to consider.

<|startoftext|>@Mike196110 @milkysue @jeremycorbyn True. Them as well!! 😂 The bump last summer was more discontent towards Tories &amp; Brexit, and many voted labour (instead of others) hoping he'd follow through and see the light. He hasn't &amp; gone full stream ahead into Brexit and now that has peed alot of peeps off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@milkysue @jeremycorbyn Again I agree, that was a complete disaster and I'm not a fan of TB any more than you. He should be tried for that as based on total lies. no different to Brexit referendum tbh. That aside under Labour, as a country we were doing pretty well. That is what they need to replicate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ToryFibs She's a coward. Scared of meeting REAL people / issues. Think Grenfell. Chickened out. I'll give JC credit, at least he does, even though he's far from perfect<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@milkysue @jeremycorbyn Unfortunately that means he will not win. Blair-Brown pact in 90s realised, took party centre &amp; rest is history. Was that Labour so bad, in power for 13yrs??  The country will not go left. JC needs to change his stance on Brexit and make the case for IN. Then its a clear choice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@milkysue @jeremycorbyn Agree with first line, even some of MPs are back stabbers. However reality, JC's leftist &amp; as result, hardcore Tories WILL NEVER vote for him, NO MATTER WHAT regardless who local MP is. I know / meet these Tory people across country, all say same thing. Not voting Lab b/c of JC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn Should be THRASHING weakest PM in history but are not🤨 WHY NOT?🤔 Any decent PR team be all over #Tories  Or maybe know will never win core Tories, content to let #Brexit go ahead, KNOWING FULL WELL will be worse off (impact reports) Hope to win GE on back of this  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn Last paragraph is sooo clichéd 🙄💤 PR sound bites for your followers. Just doesn't read/sound like you mean it. Also, calling Tories out when all you seem to do is ENABLE THEM, esp on Brexit. Ftr for a Labour govt but not as it is. Too weak, strategy all wrong, not inclusive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Trump doesn't have time to call the families of dead school children, yet has all the time in the world to call up a woman who hasn't been on TV for 20yrs, simply because of ratings??? 😳😳🤨🤔🤬 Priorities<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rsw16 @jojojoheeley @rdph1 @JGForsyth Another leaver who STILL! hasn't told me a verified good reason for leaving😂😂 Leavers can't expect everyone to follow SELF-SERVING politicians BLINDLY into the abyss!! Especially now in light of recent info from #CambridgeAnalytica everything is not what it seems<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been said if leave EU, roaming charges will most likely be brought back by UK networks. Very same charges #TheresaMay was showing off #Tories helped get abolished few months back (they didn't) 😳🤬  #StopBrexit #StopBrexitSaveBritain #ThursdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rsw16 @jojojoheeley @rdph1 @JGForsyth Truth is Leave haven't told us anything apart from unicorn chasing - the unseen thing. Oh and lie after lie. Evidence? Fox, Boris, Davis, Gove, IDS etc. Instead why not try convince me Leave is a good thing? Simple reason - can't.  It's 🦄 chasing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rsw16 @jojojoheeley @rdph1 @JGForsyth Lol check facts re advisory element 😉 rest is just political, not law. Farage went on record BEFORE ref saying he'd kick off if Leave lost. Now remain do same, everyone losing it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Police officer stood by door of #Skripal house, where Nerve agent has been found.

<|startoftext|>Or do we appeal, present new evidence to court &amp; show why original decision was wrong? Honestly believe 99.99% of people would appeal, KNOWING it could be wrong. So why any different for Brexit?🤔 @Femi_Sorry @eddiemarsan  #StopBrexit #FinalSayForAll #ToriesOUT #ThursdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit  Think of it in terms of a court case.  Case presented by both sides, jury decides, judgement passed, sentence initiated. However new info comes to light, puts original conviction in doubt.  Do we ignore it &amp; let original sentence be carried out?  #StopBrexitSaveBritain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rsw16 @jojojoheeley @rdph1 @JGForsyth as decided BY parliament, Ref was meant to be only advice to parl. Then based on outcome, Parl would discuss &amp; do what's best for the country AS A WHOLE. However it became something else during &amp; after campaign.  if #Remain had won, Leave would've been doing the exact same<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rdph1 @JGForsyth @jojojoheeley Sad thing is leavers still actually believe the BS they're getting fed. The elite don't give 2 F's about us. 'getting back control' only applies to them so can control they're interests. Elite are playing BOTH SIDES for mugs. Make no mistake ONLY THEY BENEFIT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rdph1 @JGForsyth @jojojoheeley Smoke and mirrors, old Tory trick. Ref by Tory elite (Cameron &amp; co) only a distraction from reality. They don't want EU anti-tax avoidance directive to affect them, which starts from Jan 2019. Look it up. 100% TRUTH. It's that simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Femi_Sorry @Jacob_Rees_Mogg Someone PLEASE ask @Jacob_Rees_Mogg directly how much money he would make / save / keep if brexit goes ahead?? EU anti tax avoidance directive goes EU-wide in 2019. That's the ONLY reason he wants out.  Everything else is smoke and mirrors<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This Whole #JeremyCorbyn #Antisemitism issue is highly convenient for many. Is he / isn't he, I'll leave for others to squabble over.  Ultimately main prob is he's hard left. That's what he is &amp; always has been.  As a result he won't win over #Tory voters NO MATTER WHAT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmasonnews @Gtr910 Social Justice?  Like supporting leaving #EU &amp; making everyone poorer in the process?? Radical change?  Like removing anyone who objects to his views, when all his life he's been a protester / Objecter to all Labour leadership??  Seriously Paul, think about what you're writing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Philosopha1 @Billy1Gruff @DivineDigit We need to find a Trudeau type, someone charming &amp; engaging yet believable. JC rode in on wave of pissed-off-ness, after Tory GE win, and it was right - then. But now? as each day passes, seems just wants power - at any cost. And brexit are his dreams come true<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn sacks @OwenSmith_MP for simply saying what party voted for at conference 🤨  Are #Jeremycorbyn &amp; co IGNORING members now?  and instead, following his own long held #Leave views? Answers on a fish   #StopBrexit #FBPE #Remain #StopBrexitSaveBritain #BrexitShambles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Billy1Gruff @DivineDigit I nearly added her name too!  She's more of a head teacher though, whereas JC more a head of physics 😂  Yesterday I said JC was like a head teacher. I stand corrected - he isn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EnfieldforEU @whyareweleaving @BrexitBin @UKLabour It's like putting the lowest paid worker,  who's always moaning and sniping (we all know one 😉) in charge of a multi million pound company. He'll have some ideas but won't have the foggiest on how to implement or upscale. That's what we have here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gtr910 What's concerning is #CambridgeAnalytica &amp; #Jeremycorbyn lack of interest. If Leave used CA to spread disinformation &amp; lies during campaign, how can it be legitimate?  For JC to say Ref is 'will of the people' when a blind man can see it's now BS, just makes him look MORE stupid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gtr910 It's also important to remember in recent poll, over 78% of Lab grass roots want 2nd vote / ref on the brexit deal.  guess many of those are JC supporters. Labour leadership conveniently ingnoring this. The slogan 'for the many, not the few'  applies inward too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DivineDigit Read my mind (or tweet😉) Defo has some good ideas we can go with but he's a minister, at best. No natural charm, has personality of head of year in school. Suppressing his true Leaver feelings cause doesn't want to pee off Lab remainers.  But It's already too late..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@majorsharpe1875 @eddiemarsan the minute he did that stunt on train other year, I knew he wasn't cut out. It was all a load of crap and he got caught.  Plus, his question technique at PMQs, you'd think he'd know by now Tories know how to BS their way out of pretty much anything! But he persists. Unreal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@majorsharpe1875 @eddiemarsan Tell me about it!  I wonder the same everyday 🤨😳🤨 All mean well im sure but clearly out of their depth. Ultimately they're all protesters at heart, that's all they've ever done. And they still are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Femi_Sorry Femi dude, the 6 tests is b*ll*cks, it's a ruse to keep us remainers onside. But in reality, as an ardent LEAVER he's already forgotten them. Squate peg, round hole.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eddiemarsan Mate, he's a backtracker! What do we expect from a backbench protester who's somehow ended up as leader?? Out of his depth. Be a good minister, fighting for a cause (NHS) but as leader, he's not worthy. Honestly, I'd take Gordon Brown back anyday over this!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Femi_Sorry @PeoplesMomentum I'll tell you one stat @UKLabour won't want to make public...the number of people who have left in the last 6 months, All because of Brexit. They'll happily tell you how many have joined, but very much doubt opposite.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@10DowningStreet @theresa_may Theresa May could tell me with certainty that Aliens have landed and I would not believe a word of it. You're doing all this to appease the Tory elite (and husband) who I'm guessing after Jan'19 won't be subject to EU anti tax avoidance policy😉 Funny how that's not come out🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn You have NEC, Gen sec &amp; obviously you're leader, but as long as you're for #Brexit you won't become PM. It's a simple choice. #Tories are better at #Brexit than you &amp; won't let you win. Change course, make case FOR EU &amp; show why, and THEN you could win.  Otherwise it's futile<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn Jeremy, really truly want you to be THE guy, but you keep going back into Head teacher routine. we know this doesn't come naturally to you but you could FLATTEN #Tories if you changed direction on #EU<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Scotland638 Possibly but I think there's something more sinister at play. Like a good thriller, it just seems too easy to point the finger at Russia<|endoftext|>

Seem to recall he did same to Atsu at Newcastle too but only yellow 🤨 Was Mané's red at #City a one-off or rules changed? No consistency #MUNLIV #LFC #YNWA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fierce as always although not football wise. Mou long ball plan worked, good finish by Rash, fortune on 2nd. Poor defensively by Trent Lov &amp; Can on both. Other than that was All #LIVERPOOL but nothing clear. Ref missed 4 pen shouts, expect 1 to be given.   #MUNLIV #YNWA #LFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PIGTROUGH10 @britainelects @ICMResearch @eddiemarsan You're right, Tories aren't. But it is so frustrating watching JC. He could be SO much better, but for whatever reason, he isn't. And It's a concern.  I put this squarely down to his Brexit strategy, which is Tory-like in all but name. If he sticks to it, he will lose<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@britainelects @PIGTROUGH10 @ICMResearch The only thing people need to know is #JeremyCorbyn  isn't working.  He and Labour should be ABSOLUTELY THRASHING this sh*t shower of a Govt and it's ridiculous leader in the polls. But they're not. And the only conclusion is...brexit What you think @eddiemarsan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevinSharpe59 @chrispbacon105 Wow.  And people think he's gonna change!  Leopard. Change. A. Spots. Doesn't. It's - Rearrange.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carolJhedges @alastaircraig Carol, why would you let some self serving, Tory loving, ar*e licking, self centrist loudmouth offend you??  She's not worthy.

<|startoftext|>In ol' days, if BoE came out &amp; said this X &amp; Y will do this, Govt would listen &amp; act esp if bad.

<|startoftext|>Brexit  Married couple with kids, one decides wants to leave family &amp; get divorced, to explore &amp; have other partners around world. But at same time, still wants to keep some benefits of marriage. Without being married.  🤨🤪🤬 #stopbrexit #FBPE #EU #ExitFromBrexit #FridayFeeling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SODEMAction @Hishyeness @JuliaHB1 Brexit - a married couple with kids, where one partner decides they want to leave the family &amp; get divorced, so can go explore the world &amp; other partners, But at the same time, still wants to keep 'some' of better benefits of the marriage. Without being married. 🤨😳🤪😵🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@albawhitewolf @JuliaHB1 @guyverhofstadt @SODEMAction @JuliaHB1 I suppose no different to Hard right Brexit 'nutters' (your word) standing on the grass outside Westminster, or a Radio/TV studio, talking crap all day about something they have no idea about, are typical of 48m British people.

<|startoftext|>@alanferrier @COutwin @Conservatives and @theresa_may  were cock-a-hoop, saying they'd saved everyone in UK a load of money by abolishing roaming charges, when in fact it was the EU. And now? They're basically saying stuff that. We honestly CANNOT BELIEVE A WORD that comes out of their mouths<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheNewEuropean He's been setting up deals for him and his mates, post Brexit. They're not bothered about the country. It's all BS. They say one thing, do another<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Femi_Sorry 2/2 eg By staying in EU, how will this negatively effect your business / wealth, given that EU Tax avoidance directive will apply to the UK? They will crap themselves! In fact could base most questions around EU Tax avoidance. Reality? that's MAIN reason Tory toffs want Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Femi_Sorry Thread 1/2 Good spot 👍🏼 We Anti-Brexiteers should get together and draw up a list of say, 10-15 questions, such as to do with what you've mentioned, and then just REPEATEDLY ASK these of the Brexiteers, such as #JRM #BorisJohnson #Gove  ON THE RECORD. They will hang themselves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesmb @OldBobCyprus @Jacob_Rees_Mogg Good read, even if not Tory fan 😉 #JRM is a user - not of drugs, but of people. He doesn't give two f's about anyone but those on his level &amp; above. Everyone else, low life not worthy of his time. JM was PM when in my 20's, always felt he was classy.

<|startoftext|>@Paul_McCreesh @SoylentGreen78 @pintoo @eddiemarsan @Andrew_Adonis @OwenJones84 Agreed.  if we say halved the money we're spending on Trident, £15bn instead of £30bn, imagine what you could do with that 🤔 Just a thought<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Paul_McCreesh @SoylentGreen78 @pintoo @eddiemarsan @Andrew_Adonis @OwenJones84 Exactly. Always criticising, looking for faults, nit-picking etc. As much I agree with many bits of JC policies (tuition fees) I just can't get my head around why he's so anti-Eu, when the EU IS the defender of workers rights etc 😕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NadineDorries Lol Irony's on you. Maggie was SO great, she got deposed by a virtual nobody, who was then LEADER of Conservatives &amp; PRIME MINISTER for 7 years!

<|startoftext|>@eddiemarsan @Andrew_Adonis Generally @OwenJones84 talks well but loyal pup routine towards JC although admirable, now beginning to grate. #JohnMajor stated what most sensible people believe. #Brexit WAS &amp; IS a madness that only helps 2 types.

<|startoftext|>What Syrian Govt using &amp; how, if true, is disgraceful &amp; something #UN needs to act on. But media bias for rebels, many who are affiliated to Al Qaeda type groups, is also not right. No balance.

<|startoftext|>Syrian bombs trying to force rebels out, innocents getting caught. Shocking. Heart bleeds😪 Govt easy to blame, Rebels as guilty.

<|startoftext|>@Andy84lfc Agreed. JC seems an honourable man in most part, and believe overall he'd be good for the country. However has to realise that IN EU is the way forward, and must convince the Labour areas who voted leave why it is. He knows it's true but can't seem to shake long standing beliefs<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Andy84lfc Like them to mate but issue is #Corbyn been anti-EU all his political life.

<|startoftext|>@eddiemarsan @heidi_mp @stellacreasy @hilarybennmp @jessphillips @DavidLammy @RuthCadbury @lucianaberger The issue in #Labour is ones who are  about Leave are mostly over 60.

These oldies are STILL stuck in the 70's<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eddiemarsan @heidi_mp @stellacreasy @hilarybennmp @jessphillips @DavidLammy @RuthCadbury @lucianaberger Agreed Eddie 👍🏼 There are some v good people in @UKLabour who need to be heard &amp; utilised, and not marginalised by JC &amp; co.

<|startoftext|>@d_m_w11 @JSanderson1973 @ChrisEubankJr Maybe, that's what we're gonna find out.  IF he does, think could become something special. Got raw talent, solid physique, stamina &amp; speed.

<|startoftext|>@JSanderson1973 @ChrisEubankJr @mrdavidhaye @chris Can't say as never met Jr, so difficult to say but to me that's irrelevant. Granted Jr isn't everyone's cup of tea, his dad wasn't either. that's your personal choice. What's important is having ability &amp; not utilising correctly. That's where Jr is at<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnythingLFC_ Only one man for the job, and the one who'd react the same if he it went or otherwise - Milly 👍🏼😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JSanderson1973 @ChrisEubankJr Experience won that fight. Jr didn't follow 'a' plan, he says because of the cut. I think he needs new trainer, someone like Salas or Booth to really focus his boxing skills. Skills are there, need honing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JSanderson1973 @ChrisEubankJr FtR was/am Groves fan before, as well as Jr. In this, was Chris. when everyone was with Froch, was with Groves. gutted when he lost.

<|startoftext|>@ChrisEubankJr Not sure why all hate on here. Jealousy? Groves won but wasn't beating or anything. He got strategy right, you didn't.

You can come again but time for a new approach. Get a trainer in, someone like Adam Booth (again) With him there last night, you'd have won easily<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scrappy. Groves won but V dirty tactics. Why Ref didn't dock GG for holding arm in every round?!round he didn't - 12th (when shoulder went) he got caught.

<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn good point but why the need to harp back to 2003, what about now??  You just cannot see it?

<|startoftext|>Spot on. Time for @jeremycorbyn @UKLabour to get their sh*t together. Brexit is FUBAR. Hanging onto vote from 18mths ago when new info shows only bad news is not way forward. MUST change course for good of country. #justdoit #StopBrexit #StopBrexitSaveBritain #MondayBlogs #FBPE  https://t.co/OPfwEh6OAQ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That feeling when you wake up, #RafaBenitez has won, #ManUtd have lost, #Liverpool have won and topped it off by watching #PaulChowdhry at Sheffield city hall.

<|startoftext|>Professional by the Reds, cool as, 3rd gear, everyone did their job, #karius was solid, made couple of crucial saves, good return for #VVD 😉 On to Porto in champions league on Wednesday  #SOULIV #LFC #YNWA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can see Martin Atkinson is over compensating for last Sunday!! Some absolute stone wall fouls FOR LFC not given, yet Saints virtually every little touch   #SOULIV #LFC #YNWA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Again!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How was that kick TO THE HEAD by Valencia on Atsu, not a red?? Same as Mané's🤨🤨 Refs are so inconsistent #NEWMUN #LFC #YNWA #PremierLeague<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tony_Robinson Do as scene from Blackadder.  BA (PM) - Baldrick, we've done it, we can Leave! Baldrick (Davis) - great news master Phone rings. Irish Pm - so what's plans for Irish border?  BA - Oh F*** Baldrick - Don't worry, have a cunning plan. We pretend we know what we're talking about 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JulieOwenMoylan @pete_at_tweet I believe there is a change of mood and direction. Yes analysts do paint the worse case scenario but even if it isn't as bad, it's still bad. Who wants to lose their job or take home less pay, only to satisfy the wants of the tax dodging elite such as Rees-Mogg??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>After watching #LFC legends training, I'm certain Stevie G could do a 15-20min job in a match. Top 4 run-in and CL games coming up, he's there, he's available and he's all Red!

<|startoftext|>@LFC @LFCFoundation Let's get it going #BringBackStevieG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesMelville @Piethagoram Someone, anyone please just ask Rees-Mogg how much HE will lose / benefit from Brexit / no brexit.  LIVE, ON TV, IN FRONT OF A CROWD. And also in HoC.  Let's we him squirm out of that one..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LFC @LFCFoundation Wow. Stevie G should do a Scholes and get his boots back on. Tight game, bring him on. All we need is 15-20mins. That's enough for him to influence it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toryboypierce Only person who seems to be making money from Brexit is you!  Everytime turn on sky news, your bloomin there!😂 You're loving it!

<|startoftext|>@eddiemarsan Damn right Eddie! Are #JeremyCorbyn &amp; co going to close their eyes to these reports and back the Tories. OR go 'wait a second, this is a bad idea, we need to reconsider'  THIS decision will be THE pivotal moment that will decide his and the countries fate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JulieOwenMoylan @pete_at_tweet Yes but we need to keep social media pressure up (as we are) to make politicians KNOW we're better in, than out. @jeremycorbyn MUST change his views FOR THE MANY! Open his eyes and drop stubbornness to old views. Will change course of history if he does and become PM to boot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pete_at_tweet @JulieOwenMoylan Rees-Mogg's Co. manages assets worth £9bn, EU policy kicks in, will lose much of that business as law closes loopholes. Immigration, borders, laws - these are all smokescreens used by Hard right to Leave. Defo issues to sort but can be addressed while in EU. Other countries have<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pete_at_tweet @JulieOwenMoylan Thanks Pete, glad to hear it 👍🏼 Tell your friend main reason for Brexit is so Tory elite (hard right) can avoid EU Tax directive which kicks in Jan 2019, Where use offshore companies to avoid tax. Rees-Mogg one of worst. And he's also one of loudest for Brexit. Coincidence?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JulieOwenMoylan @pete_at_tweet You make a valid point overall Julie but not this last tweet. if our children made a mistake or error in judgement, we'd STILL encourage them to change/mend their ways. It's NEVER too late, especially so in this now that the new info can CONFIRM what remainers knew/felt all along<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Well, well, well.  He's only gone and actually admitted it!!😂😂 Ever since the incidents in #LIVTOT game Sun, been saying all along this comes from the manager. And now we know.  #LFC #YNWA @AYPrivateEye @LFCDaytrippers  https://t.co/iweYYaLMdm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CheckatradeTrophy  Lincoln's first pen was over the line...how did ref miss that?? Another shocker!! #LincolnCity  #ChelseaU21 #FA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@8629Fissile Exactly. The difference is, the managers. Klopp - German, all about fairness and doing it the right way. Poch - do whatever to get a decision. If Alli &amp; Kane were south American, it's normal, like Lamela did. Be clever to get the decision.  Even Suarez used to!! Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesPearceEcho John Moss, bless him, done his bit but really should retire. Not even going into the offsides and dives, just his general decision making is not sound. So many he gets wrong. And these 2 images highlight perfectly why fans rage. So inconsistent and tbf, he isn't alone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesPearceEcho John Moss, who gave nothing for this🤨  https://t.co/HTDbkp2PfJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayreid1987 @AYPrivateEye Mate, check my feed, I've said exactly same lol 😉👍🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrexitBites @MarieAnnUK The prob with that is many MPs = remain, but their Area = Leave, so they'd have a real job of turning those people around.  Even Anne Sourby has this problem in her constituency. But I believe it can be done, with the right facts and info 👍🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrexitBites @MarieAnnUK I agree. He gives the impression he's for the greater good, but the greater good is HIS view only ie hard left. Not what country needs. That's why I say, change or step aside. He won't, but I can ask 😂 Maybe time to shake up British politics - a new party?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarieAnnUK @BrexitBites JC on home issues, everyone in Labour is pretty much with him. But on Brexit, No. He mobilised last summer on his charm of anti-austerity etc. Now add anti-brexit and he can do it. He just needs to stop faffing around. Tories are there for the taking. Anti-Brexit is the clincher<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarieAnnUK @BrexitBites JC either needs to switch &amp; go explain to Lab Constituents why in EU is BETTER &amp; how he can make it work for them, thereby getting people onside. Or he needs to step aside &amp; let someone else who can. Brexit is Bigger than party politics, it's about what's right for the Next Gen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarieAnnUK @BrexitBites Issue is simple. He's personally FOR brexit, been his life long ambition. And ref gave him opportunity to fulfil. Him being remain was only as thought they'd win, didn't want to look numpty. Now full on Brexit, but trying to be fair by adding t&amp;cs. Load of c**p. We see through it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AYPrivateEye Don't understand why the issue. All offsides are like this. Ball played through, guy tries to beat defensive line. That's what Alli &amp; Kane were doing. not something new, they do all time. HK was offside as ball played. Simple. Totally Irrelevant that Lovren touches it #LFC #YNWA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayreid1987 @AYPrivateEye Clattenburg came out &amp; said both decisions were wrong / offside. Why, have to wonder, did he see it differently??  Maybe because he's not on PGMOL payroll any more! Works for Saudi FA, can say what he wants - truth. PGMOL is backtracking &amp; covering it's &amp; Moss's ar*e #LFC #YNWA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrizzKhan  This might have something to do with your John Achterberg comment earlier... #LFC #YNWA #Karius  https://t.co/VP3iCO6sZo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Re #Courtois, What are @Carra23 and @WayneRooney on about on #MNF??😂  that was a DIVE by #deulofeu lads, just like yesterday by Kane. They call it clever play, I call it conning the ref.  #SkySports #MNF #WATCHE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Players being 'clever' to win penalties, In other words, coning the refs. Or where i come from, CHEATING Something need to be done..  #WATCHE #LFC #SPURS #PL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was never a pen. Another diver #deulofeu Left leg hanging to win a pen. What are keepers supposed to do...become invisible??  #WATCHE #LFC #LFCTOT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yakman75 @DavidJRice83 @JamesPearceEcho @Carra23 Exactly. A guess, which is even worse!! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidJRice83 @JamesPearceEcho @Carra23 I'm guessing lino had a tenner on Kane getting 100th goal in front of Kop so told ref was a foul 😂 and that's why he fist pumped - quids in! 😉😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidJRice83 @JamesPearceEcho @Carra23 Don't get me started on 2nd 😂 Ref waves &amp; says NO PEN, then stops 5sec later as piling forward, goes over to lino. Few secs later, gives pen. 1. did ref see it? Yes, otherwise why did wave no pen 2. what did lino say made him change his mind, as already clearly seen &amp; said no?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthanes7 @DavidJRice83 @JamesPearceEcho To me it's the same. Plus how come the GK didn't get sanctioned for flattening Bobby 😂  It's a clear cover up job by the refs association<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthanes7 @DavidJRice83 @JamesPearceEcho What's the difference with that and the one bobby had ruled offside where Lloris took him out? At time ball was played through, bobby was offside. It didn't reach him either. The flag went up well before GK flattened him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidJRice83 @JamesPearceEcho They say Kane wasn't interfering but I'm sorry that's BS. As the striker, he's waiting for a through ball from Alli, who did exactly that. And therefore at the time of release from DA's foot, Kane IS offside.  @Carra23<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidJRice83 @JamesPearceEcho I've been saying exactly the same thing! Doesn't matter Lov touches it, Kane was offside when the ball from Alli was put through to him. End of. They're simply trying to show that 'Martin'  didn't influence the decision and Moss made it. Absolute Shambles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnythingLFC_ @richard_conway The whole thing stinks of a cover up. This isn't about that game now. It's done. Trying to back up the refs is good but when they've SO OBVIOUSLY made a mistake,  admit it. that way at least we'll think they're human. As it stands, they'll just get more hate, regardless of teams<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnythingLFC_ @richard_conway Lovren's touch was AFTER this. Why didn't lino see that? #VAR would have<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnythingLFC_ @richard_conway Or this. when Alli played the ball, Kane was offside. What don't they explain HOW they missed that then??  https://t.co/6BLfVyjlmu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B_James91 @cjs021020 @richard_conway @AHunterGuardian Makes me laugh 😂 so obvious. putting aside Kane was in offside position when Alli played ball (regardless of Lovren's touch) could EASILY have stayed on feet, gone around Karius &amp; tapped in. Why didn't he? Been told to go over. Just like Alli went over for yellow. Lamela too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JurgenKlopp  "I'm not allowed to go in the [referees'] room for half an hour after the game. The first thing after the whistle he [the referee] comes to me and says he made a mistake, clear offside, unbelievable." 😲🤪😵😲🤪  #LFC #LFCTOT #LIVTOT #YNWA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Tory_Workers @scared_now @MailOnline talk about vague! 🤪 Can you give us a number? afterall quite a big accusation that. And can you confirm, given that you're making such sweeping statements, is it more, or less, than Theresa May's Jag, range rovers, etc. and the vehicles ministers use.  Just wondering...🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Again, VAR needed. first penalty should never have been given. It was ALSO offside. Alli plays the ball to Kane, he's off, regardless of Lovren's touch. Seems Linesman is not very competent at all, he missed BOTH.  #LIVTOT #LFCTOT #LFC #YNWA #VAR  https://t.co/JAPQF0hdka<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another example VAR needed in every game. Not hard. 4 cameras, 2 each side, auto tracking across each half. If off, sends beep to refs earpiece, can check on handheld device if needs to. Cricket,Tennis have, why can't football? These decisions ruin games.  #LFCTOT #lfc #LIVTOT  https://t.co/jR0naUokcU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@F365 Funny how Alli got yellow though for the blatant of blatant dives, and  also another couple where Spurs players gone down way too easily. Must be from the manager. Last third of pitch, any touch - go down. Shame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@F365 He did (left trailing leg, touch Karius then theatrical) He was (when Alli FIRST plays ball he's off) It was (he TOO was offside BEFORE slightest of touches from VvD &amp; collapsing like been shot) If VAR, both are offside. However draw right on play although LFC gutted as so close<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If VAR was in use today, both Spurs goals would have been offside. Kane was when ball played by Alli, regardless of Lovren's touch. And so was Lamela before he decided someone in the upper tier had shot him in backside😂  #LFC #YNWA #salah #LIVTOT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Talking points besides penalties - #JohnMoss  Vs City, gives Mané red for high challenge.  Vs Spurs, gives Alex-Arnold yellow for shin high challenge after winning ball, and then Ben Davies does one, head height - Nothing given. Why the inconsistency?? #LIVTOT #LFC  #YNWA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SachinNakrani Yeah but who falls like that? I'll tell you who, cheats who want a penalty. Spurs fans are deluded if they think that even if VvD did touch the back of his leg, why does he falls backwards like he's been shot! We all want to win but this is a joke. Pure and simple - cheating<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesPearceEcho He's not wrong. For me, Kane, Alli, Lamela etc. all look like actually TOLD to go down with ANY contact by manager. Think Maradona and you'll get what my gist 😉 just look at Alli's dive, pure cheating &amp; he KNEW it. Didn't flinch or argue when got yellow #LIVTOT #LFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DexStern @AYPrivateEye What I call 'forwards professional play'. Touch the ball, keepers comes at speed, knock the ball wide, leave leg trailing to touch said GK, touch trailing leg, go over. Pen. Text book by Kane.  I always wonder though what is GK supposed to do, teleport??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Andy84lfc @AndyK_LivNews Totally agree. However Top 4 is firmly in our hands. 5pts clear of Spuds in 5th, 8 from Arsenal in 6th.  Spuds play Scumchester tonight.

<|startoftext|>@Andy84lfc @AndyK_LivNews If successful again, that's 2 more in April. And if we're successful then, that's one more in May. Total games if we get to final of CL would be 20. This is how he's looking at it. Do we need to buy for 13 games plus a few more?  That's why he's said short term, no, long term yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Andy84lfc @AndyK_LivNews Klopp's looking at it like this. 13 league games left or one a week. have we got enough in squad to cement minimum of Top 4? He clearly thinks so,  even with losing Coutsy and Studge.  Then we play 2 CL games in Feb. If successful, another 2 in March.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AYPrivateEye Exactly what I said to my son!😂 Our striker scores that, he's a genius Not Keepers fault. Flip it. Their striker scores that, pure fluke. Our keepers a n*b &amp; worst ever to pick up gloves! 😂 Like in Star Wars, needs to be Balance in the Force 😉 #LFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@theonionlives @AYPrivateEye Lols on you. HQ of beIN sports in Qatar,  have a contact. Believe whatever but I've no gain or interest in bs'ing. Just gutted tbh. And we gonna look like chumps if City end up signing him. W or AM,  Proven prem &amp; CL, eligible for last 16, player of year, won title. No brainer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theonionlives @AYPrivateEye Who knows for sure 🤷🏻‍♂️ my info came via Qatar, and BeIN sports broke Mahrez news so seems sound. It was when lads were in Dubai, and so was Mahrez Klopp was the one who pulled it apparently<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AYPrivateEye That's cool but RB came out and said he ain't leaving now, which implies something clearly was being attempted behind the scenes. And then it didn't happen for whatever reason<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@L22redL22 @JamesPearceEcho Ditto to that. Said pretty much same earlier. Never 100%, not Klopp-Like and pace has gone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theonionlives @AYPrivateEye Info came out of Qatar &amp; UAE. If you  have a look you'll find it 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why can't #liverpoolfc have negotiators like #ManCity ?  They pay, not always OTT, but done SO EASILY😏 Us on other hand have to draw sword from stone, shine it, put it back as found, then try again🙄Torture #LFC doing deals #YNWA @LFC @empireofthekop @thisisanfield @TheRedmenTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AYPrivateEye Day after Couts news broke, we had Keita coming early and Mahrez too. We were all 'ok, that'll do'. And then nothing. The Mahrez deal WAS happening, but someone pulled plug at last minute. Keita came down to a simple currency exchange, which AGAIN FSG don't want to pay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wwgrooms @empireofthekop Agree 👍🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wwgrooms @empireofthekop Invest heavily, buy 2-3 star players (like they do in Baseball) create much stronger squad depth and challenge for titles.  Wealth will follow, Value of club will increase<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wwgrooms @empireofthekop Not enough &amp; may force Klopp's hand eventually.  But he doesn't help himself. All for 'build it &amp; they will come' but didn't see Conte having that problem? After 10 games he figured it &amp; won the league. Yes he had a better squad but that's my point. FSG got wrong way round 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wwgrooms @empireofthekop Disagree with 1st bit. Salah going rate, around Mané fee. Keita clause plus 7m premium to secure. VvD is extravagant but had to or look like chumps. plus crucially, they KNEW Couts was off so that fee was offset. In reality we haven't spent big, just a PERCEPTION we have<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CentralMids @JamesPearceEcho @IverHanrahan And that's prob. We don't have strong depth each position. Who we have for Mané, Salah, Firms, of same level? City Scum, Chavs do. That's who up against. Admire Klopp's make em yourself philosophy but this isn't Germany where only one other big team. Need ready made players too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CentralMids @JamesPearceEcho @IverHanrahan Klopp has alot of faith in Bobby, rightly so, but my test for any player is would they get in the other 5 top teams in England. Would Ingsy and Solanke? Not IMO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wwgrooms @empireofthekop With LFC under FSG, we can't assume anything!! Lol  How many players in last 7-8yrs have we missed out on, and mostly it seems down to finance ie they're v tight!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CentralMids @JamesPearceEcho @IverHanrahan Crazy is keeping him and expecting him to keep fit (he won't) be patient in WC year (he won't) and play to managers style  (he  can't)  Shame cause I really liked / rated Studge but that ship has sailed sadly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CentralMids @JamesPearceEcho @IverHanrahan but Studge wasn't playing anyway so not really crazy to let a guy go who a. Isn't first choice backup b. Doesn't suit style of play c. Frequently picks up a niggle<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@UKLabour @jeremycorbyn  Now truth re #Brexit out, are you going to plough on blindly like #Tories OR are you going to do RIGHT THING, ask for it's release &amp; make case to country to stop this.

<|startoftext|>@empireofthekop Given both rusty &amp; raw, we're in CL &amp; Top 4 race, should have experienced backup. Why Klopp won't get #Aubameyang is weird. Players like that don't come along THIS easily, Unless such a nightmare to manage he thinks can do without. Scare Sh*t out of everyone though if we did!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@empireofthekop see what you're getting at but very Harsh. One's been out for 2yrs (and scored I believe in his last game before the injuries started) and the other just got here, is young and 3rd-4th choice. Play either EVERY game &amp; they'll both defo score, if we play like we did pre-swansea<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Riddock__ To me not about FSG in/out, but since came in, we've had go for title ONCE in just over 7yrs, under BR, been Top 4 few times and one cup win. I'm sorry but that's not good enough. Even bloomin Leicester won league with Morgan and.Wigan won FA cup in that time!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 So intelligent but such a childish tweet! When you sell your house, you've 'sold' it.

<|startoftext|>@DanielHewittITV @nicolaluvsart @realDonaldTrump Me, right after reading his comments  https://t.co/9xqFhASamR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickLoney @GrizzKhan Lol word is he's got a gentleman's agreement with owners for 50m ish..? Not sure on the validity but he's never a 90m player. And Neither is Lemar!  Neymar deal has completely messed up the market<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrizzKhan Lemar is a good player but 60-90m - No. I'd rather go Mahrez or Zaha, much cheaper and Both would add spark to our squad. Seriously disheartened and frustrated right now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@empireofthekop The main problem is CL cup tied . All the main guys you'd like have played already so can't and he probably thinks what we have is enough for Prem. But surely to God there are quality players out there that CAN play in CL and Prem. Mahrez for one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrizzKhan I'm Sorry but can't understand why Klopp doesn't see any value in adding #mahrez to our squad?!? LITERALLY A NO BRAINER!! Player of year 18mths ago, takes free kicks, fast, tricky, plays either wing or AM,  Perfect for counter attack, Prem AND CL experience. What's not to buy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LFC fans after hearing quotes from Klopp's presser today...  #LFC #Klopp #YNWA @empireofthekop @thisisanfield @LFC @LFCDaytrippers @AnythingLFC_ @AYPrivateEye  https://t.co/ey4ZbjDCze<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPD2212 @lindjw @jeremycorbyn 👍🏼 To me 'Lefties' in Labour are no different to the 'righties' in Tory party. Only interested in THEIR own agenda, not about inclusion and what's BEST. Like you been life long but way they are going (hard left) not so sure. I hope they correct themselves before it's too late<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thisisanfield Clearly creativity shortage. Why can't Klopp see it?? Yes not one man team but a new player will add 100% add something, Such as Mahrez or Draxler. With La-la out (AGAIN!) We MUST buy. Everyone else is strengthening for last push, why aren't we??? 🤨😲🤪 #LFC #Klopp #YNWA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thisisanfield Oh dear. Klopp is literally playing poker by  not bringing anyone in and relying on current squad.  If he goes with same and pulls it off, he's a genius. If he doesn't, he'll be for the plank!  Plus 1 or 2 injuries (god forbid) and we're royally screwed! #LFC #Klopp #YNWA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Brendykerr @timvo911 Or perhaps time to look at GK coach, Achterberg. Reina - started fluffing. Migs - highly rated at S'derland Karius - 2nd best in Germany at Mainz (after Neuer)summer we bought. Since been under him they've deteriorated. Coincidence? Reina done well in Italy &amp; Germany after left<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeanette5045 @jeremycorbyn They are on NHS, education, homelessness and few more, but on Brexit? No way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeanette5045 @jeremycorbyn My main issue is hypocrisy. Example  been back bench dissenter, voting against party most of time, and yet now, as leader, any dissenting voices are castigated and potential deselection for not towing HIS line.  Goose and gander<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeanette5045 @jeremycorbyn Right now, he's doing what Blair / Brown did in 90's, trying to change the image of labour. In his case it's to soften from hard left<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeanette5045 @jeremycorbyn You misunderstand. JC does have some good ideas, such as tuition fees, NHS. But a Leopard doesn't change it spots. He was 'campaigning' for remain (very little may add) yet ALL his political life, has been anti-EU?? 🤨🤨🤔   You can't kid a kidder.  I can see through it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeanette5045 @jeremycorbyn These areas are the worse affected by austerity and yet didn't see their party doing anything about it.   Last year's GE was a protest, in many ways, against Leave vote. Even JC / JM didn't expect the result!  So it's a major problem and that's why he's playing soft softly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeanette5045 @jeremycorbyn That's the problem he faces. reason the majority of lab constituents voted leave, imho, is they are totally peed off at Tories wrecking the country with austerity. I live in one of those Remain Lab MP / Leave areas. Was a protest vote. Many didn't know arguments, still don't<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn in a pickle🤨 The majority of #Labour members voted him in, and yet, the very SAME Labour members, the MAJORITY want #Remain Don't be a #hypocrite Jeremy. You CANNOT, MUST NOT ignore this fact. Stop faffing around.  #marr #Peston #Corbyn #brexitshambles #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn says majority of #Labour members voted Remain but a third voted Leave. Plus over 3/4's of PLP are in favour of Remain.  So Who does 'For the Many, not the Few' apply to...?🤨🤔🤨🤔  #hypocrite #Marr #bbcdp #FBPE #Remain #BrexitShambles #Peston #SundayMorning<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>signing Lemar or Keita aren't the answer. We need a GK, another CB and ready to go DM.  Defence has no cover, Can / Jini bypassed all the time. Until then, we will continue to have these shambolic (defending) nights.  @GrizzKhan @LFCDaytrippers @LFC #RuinedMySaturdayNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@John_W_Henry / FSG have serious questions to answer. Somethings not right. Do we have money to buy top players or not? Or is Klopp saying he's happy with his lot?  Either way WE, THE FANS deserve better. It's a joke! can't sell your best player &amp; expect to keep doing well  #LFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, so we sell our best &amp; only world class player, one who produced mini miracle now n then, and expect to keep doing well? Are #FSG for real?? DO ME A FAVOUR!!😠 These last 2 games have shown clearly we're STILL a few quality players short, incl GK, DM, WF &amp; CF  #LFC #LIVWBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We were utter Sh*te, West Brom deserved to win, simple as that. Until FSG (&amp; Klopp) realise that to win, you need quality back-ups AS WELL as main guys, we will continue to have these moments. Been our prob since BR #LFC #LIVWBA #FACup @GrizzKhan @empireofthekop @AYPrivateEye<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AYPrivateEye Tbf Hendo, Milly and Ingsy did ok but reality is, is that the what we can do from bench?? tells you everything!! City, Chavs and Scum have far better options<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AYPrivateEye Totally agree bro. Equal Worst performance of the season (Spuds other)  No guts, no Glory - simple as that. 8 players were shite today with 'only' Mo, Bobby and Vvd showing a smidgen of effort. absolutely gutted.   Klopp - love him but got some wrong tonight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesPearceEcho @IverHanrahan What exactly has he done in last 2 seasons which justifies it being Crazy James?  More importantly, it was crazy that we let lil Phil go and no one coming in - as yet. Lallana is capable to a degree but him getting another Injury should be the alarm bell That we need another<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lfctransfershq Need 2 players. one of Fekir, Lemar or Draxler for Couts role, plus Wil Zaha.  #Fekir looks classy, #draxler  could play wide or no.10, same for #Lemar  Zaha would scare crap out of defences in our team, plus create space for others. mega option from bench too.

<|startoftext|>@ben_pensant @starvinmarvin33 @Kevin_Maguire Hey, I get what you're saying but don't kid yourself - they know how to manipulate the words and they played on it BIG TIME with massive PR. Bottom line? THEY LIED. The 350m that goes to EU was a gross figure, it's closer to 150m / week. the whole slogan was false AND misleading<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_pensant @starvinmarvin33 @Kevin_Maguire Lol I'm just passing on info out there in the big wide world 😉 I see your on repeat again regarding the words....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_pensant @starvinmarvin33 @Kevin_Maguire Can argue toss out of this &amp; that, reality is in many interviews he said the same. So didn't promise but he DEFINITELY used the NHS slogan as closer and was a MAJOR reason for leave winning.  Now using NHS as power grab as TM so weak. What is a politicians 'Promise' anyway🤔😉😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_pensant @starvinmarvin33 @Kevin_Maguire Hilarious! You 2 arguing over words Lol Fact is BJ campaigned around country on that bus, which 'common' folk TOOK to mean 350m/week we 'GIVE' to EU should 'GO' to NHS. 'MOST' will have seen it &amp; thought 'yeah that's right'. 'Many' voted leave purely on this premise. Undeniable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@londonunite @WarmongerHodges Ditto to that 😉👍🏼😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arts_fantastic @WarmongerHodges Tight in most polls, odd one #Labour in front, which usually means Tories win.  Disagree, under @Ed_Miliband distinctly remember Lab doing 'well' in most polls UNTIL that slab of 10 commitments!😲🤨😂V bad PR. Media had field day &amp; killed him. THAT was the moment Tories won GE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If EVER a performance was needed to show Klopp we DEFO need to be 'Actively' looking to get someone in  -THIS WAS IT.  No spark from anyone. When you consider how good Vs City. SHOCKING. #mahrez or #Zaha PLUS pay #Leipzig whatever it takes &amp; get Keita in NOW!  #SWALIV #LFC #YNWA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NormaFerrie @WarmongerHodges Oh I agree, they are. But Labour don't seem to be pushing on, despite all the scandals and a crappy PM and ministers. And the brexit fence sitting isn't helping Lab. Even if JC won, he's not the long term solution<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WarmongerHodges JC has long standing anti-EU views, which is his perog, but goes against majority of Labour party and his MPs. The 'will of people' BS line is repeated time after time. But if people have changed their minds, then what, simply ignore them?  That's what he's doing, imho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WarmongerHodges Evidence in similar polls as you're using. 55% people would vote remain now - and growing. As people find out more, turning against leave. Lab party members (ones who voted JC in) are showing at 70% + for remain. Most of PLP is. So question is, who is he listening to? Or not?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seems only fair. Sign and retweet, por favor 🙏🏼  Gracias 👍🏼👍🏼😉  #Brexit #StopBrexit #FBPE #MondayMotivation  https://t.co/OwZrYmRzg7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WarmongerHodges re leavers with Tories, you'll find many Labour areas voted leave. That's what they're scared of. If go full on remain, they're screwed as they won't win. If they go full on Leave - same. That's why JC, JM etc are fence sitting. Need to make solid case for remain and go with it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WarmongerHodges Yes re Lib-Dems, not sure about being 'in front'. Polls are v close, but simply not good enough when you consider how sh*t Tories are!  They should be miles ahead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WarmongerHodges Bit simplistic that. Macron is a capitalist. Corbyn the opposite.  I'll keep saying it till the cows etc. i like JC in general but we also have the worst Tory Govt EVER, and yet Labour ARE NOT in front. Why is that??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheKopHQ And maybe, we need to look at the GK coach Achterberg too. Something clearly isn't right. Pepe, Migsy, Karry - all seem to have regressed under him. One for Jürgen to address<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Hepworthclare He forgets it was the 78% who put him where he is now as leader. They can quite easily remove him as well...  He needs to listen rather than following a similar line as the Tories<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hepworthclare Same here Clare, although I've adopted it. Why? feel Corbyn (&amp; co) must understand we feel v frustrated and let down. 78% of #labour members want remain, yet he's ignoring that &amp; going with the 'will of the people' nonsense = his own deep seated anti-EU wishes<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoshuaStokesUK it'd be close again but from general vibe I see/hear/feel, probably be for Remain, in my humble opinion. % wise I'd say 55-45 to 60-40. Also remember, if we did have another, the 16/17yr olds who didn't vote last time will be able to now. My daughter being one lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshuaStokesUK Yes, it may an issue, but I think after the debates, twitter etc. I think people are MUCH wiser to the facts and can see what's what.  I can Lol<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Gaffology @piersmorgan You spotted that as well 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshuaStokesUK Better that than looking back in a few years, when things are going pear shaped, and saying ' you know what, we should have had another referendum'  We still have time, nothings set in stone, we can still choose<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshuaStokesUK Not so simple. Many voted presented with false info - by both sides, but mostly Leave. Now people finding out 'truth' and are gen worried. These choices will affect GENERATIONS, not just now. so IF that means we go again after they put a deal - using right info - on table - Cool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrizzKhan @Kev1Lfc You got to have a little faith..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Andrew_Adonis Wait, so he's one too...??🤨😂 Fact is, Farage is a ' look at me, centre of attention, my mouth is massive' kind of a guy.  V much like his pal Trump. THAT'S the reality.

<|startoftext|>@ripplecabin @thedutchmeister @hollyamcd Many Lab areas peed off at state of country, voted leave as protest to Tories.  This caused problem for Lab hq who always been ProEU. If go remain &amp; against these areas, will lose seats = lose GE. Or  if go with brexit = lose GE as many Lab remain voters will go elsewhere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ripplecabin @thedutchmeister @hollyamcd He can't &amp; won't, as believes remaining is right. Personally I agree, not always with Chuka, but we need to think VERY carefully about this. Tories want hard brexit, Jez not doing enough to stop it. To me sounds like he's all-in. We can be out &amp; in, like Norway. why does he lie?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ripplecabin @thedutchmeister @hollyamcd We DEFO need to get rid of Theresa and the Tories, but at what cost?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ripplecabin @thedutchmeister @hollyamcd Personally I like Jez and many of his values, but on Europe, his record is crystal clear, and that was well before he became leader.  That alone is the the proof. I fear he's leading Lab into a dangerous place<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrizzKhan Logic states we should get someone who isn't CL cup tied and can play so we can go all out in that. Lemar and Keita, both fantastic players, are. Mahrez and Fekir are not.  So why not get Mahrez and Keita. One available for league and FA cup, other can play all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ripplecabin @thedutchmeister @hollyamcd You mean he campaigned remain with his fingers and toes crossed 😂 Talk about half hearted! The day Leave won he was cock-a-hoop, inside.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ripplecabin @hollyamcd @ChukaUmunna MOST Lab MP's were/are remain. Fact that he keeps banging on about 'will of the people' - do me a favour! Ref was advisory, for sitting MPs to figure out what's best for country. Is that what Jeremy / Labour, or Theresa / Tories are doing??? NO CHANCE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ripplecabin @hollyamcd @ChukaUmunna Angie, I'm sorry but Holy is right. Corbyn (&amp; Co) has been anti-EU since the day he's been in parliament!! He merely 'pretended' to be remain at the ref as he thought, like most, that Remain would win and didn't want to look a d*ck. how could Labour leader be a leaver??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hollyamcd @ripplecabin @ChukaUmunna Absolutely 👏🏼👍🏼<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FRANKADEMILLE @IanDunt @steve29hall Yes, they should but sadly The #Tories are world class at shamelessly lying on camera. They know the mainstream media and  presenters are on their side and wouldn't dare<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NadineDorries Or in other words Nadine, anything you #Tories CAN'T CONTROL or NOT OWNED by the RIGHT WING Daily Mail, telegraph or S*n is medium of left🤨🤔😂Right got that, Thanks for pointing it out 👍🏼🤪 And, suppose that then makes Tory social media team at hq leftist as well? 🤔🤔😂😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Muqadaam Nadeem, you're right but at same time, imagine if they'd NOT gone in. Tories would have done 7-8yrs what they started to do when DC won in 2015.

<|startoftext|>@Muqadaam And by saying what he said re single market / customs union. He's lying - pure and simple. Norway can attest to that.   Let's not be blind sheep led by a deaf wolf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Muqadaam Agreed need #Tories out to save NHS, Educ, s/care, Trains etc. All things #Labour do much better than these numpties. I like him But JC needs to wake up BIG TIME. He ISN'T going to win by isolating remainers. Sadly right now he sounds like Farage when talking about #Brexit &amp; #EU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanDunt @steve29hall Would love it if they got her back on QT and play this to her..😵😂 Leave HQ be like 'oh f**k! What do we say now?'

<|startoftext|>@JulieOwenMoylan Actually it's far simpler than that. Tories -  Tory elite want brexit to avoid EU anti-tax clamp down from 2019.  Labour - Scared sh*tless. Party is majority remain but many Lab seats are leave. If go against that will lose seats &amp; not win GE, ergo following will of people BS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lab_Westbourne @wild_ted @ThatTimWalker @LibDems Maybe I'm missing something but last GE #Labour DIDN'T win, even WITH all these extra 4m voters!!😂 So what you on about when say losing few Lib s/flakes won't matter??🤪 Talk about Dumb &amp; Dumber😂 Reality is Lab won seats not cause of manifesto, but cause Tories are HATED<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mikeysmith Corbyn means well and seems a decent fella but he's 100% anti EU, always has been. he'll be no better than the Tories on brexit, worse in fact. Yes lab gained at last election but was that down to him? More to do with people pissed off at Tories and wanted to bloody their noses<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ole_LFC @empireofthekop @thisisanfield @AnythingLFC_ @LivEchonews @GrizzKhan Possibly, but gotta be worth a punt? Won't cost the earth and defo has the skill &amp; ability.

<|startoftext|>In most #JeremyCorbyn seems like a decent, reasonable, honest guy. e.g. His ideas for #NHS #NationalRail are exactly what's needed.

<|startoftext|>My take. #Holgate (not brightest lad - see his Twitter) hears #Firmino say 'F*la da P*ta' &amp; thinks it means '****ing n*****' , when in fact it means SoB.

<|startoftext|>@jamie_LFC_90 @LFCFansCorner My thoughts exactly. Bobby said 'are you crazy, you Son of a B*tch' in Portuguese. Ref was right there, looking at Bobby when he said whatever he said.

<|startoftext|>#Firmino accused racism towards #Holgate From what can see, RF said 'are you crazy, you SoB!' in Portuguese. Ref right there, didn't react. Weirdly no one talking about shove by MH into the stands.That's ok to do? No yellow / red?? #LFC #LFCvEFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 @Artimus_Gray Yes &amp; No. Problem seems to be people making choices. Heavy Political influence. Honours 'should' be awarded for positive contributions in field &amp; service, as was purpose. Clegg being  DPM doesn't constitute that. It's a 'cheers Nick lad' from Tories<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patrick161616 @BrunoAm05317727 I wouldn't be so sure. #BorisJohnson and #nigelfarage would make it a v close run thing 😉😂  At least with Diane I can put it down to momentary lapses. With those two, it's pretty much permanent nobheaditis<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Alexa_Kantor @Gtr910 @MichelBarnier @1daywithoutus @InLimboBrexit @AlexTaylorNews @The3Million @JunckerEU This whole situation has not been thought through. many EU citizens don't have passports so that's a cost for them to bear. Meanwhile, we Brits will need some form of visa to visit EU countries. And that will defo not come for free. Question is, who benefits if we have to pay?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ENGLANDSHEROES I love the last line 😂😂 but needs an addition 'To free Britain from the EU,  while still continuing to receive his monthly salary and get hold of his pension from said EU organisation for life'  A real man of principle we have here! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NedWarbone @Kevin_Maguire Spot on. I think most reasonable people will agree that she was gullible, most likely to her fiancé. fact remains, it's a crime having that many here or abroad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pstevens1968 @Kevin_Maguire Is sentence really too harsh? their law, that's sentence for particular crime. Re sympathy, disagree. case had lots coverage, mostly painting silly naive woman from Hull. Personally think she was duped to get hold of &amp; bring by fiancé to sell. Get caught, she's faces punishment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kevin_Maguire For breaking law of another country?🤨 Our media portrays her to be some silly angel! she was stupid, naive and just maybe, even gullible. I wonder how she got hold of 300 tablets in the first place?? And is it possible was taking them to sell, on instruction of her fiancé?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@georgegalloway @Kevin_Maguire Kevin, like your views on many/most things but afraid you're wrong on this. Laura Palmer may be stupid &amp; naive, doesn't mean it's a defence and should come home. The laws the law.

<|startoftext|>@redmysterio96 Indeed. that moment allowed the momentum to switch. Yes Young lad Jo-Go inexperience allowed first, but 2nd should have been saved two handed. Saves that, no pressure. Soon as it went in, Arsenal were up for it bigtime. Live on TV through it looked a screamer at first 🤦🏼‍♂️😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Mignolet with another shocker! Let Arsenal back into the game and invited the pressure. Klopp has to be ruthless, like he was with Lovren after spuds game.  Time for a change  #ARSLIV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What. A .Crazy. Game! Great for neutral, not for fans😂 Mad 4 mins especially 2nd goal, Migsy gotta save, straight at him. We should have buried that game 1st half. Mané lost shooting boots 🤬 2 great chances, Plus Mo and Bobby!! Even at 3-3,  could have nicked it #ARSLIV #LFC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@carolinejmolloy #ChrisGrayling is an ar*ehole.  In fact ar*eholes would be offended he's one of them now. #Tories have NOTHING left to deflect with, so they've now decided to blame Labour. Because that's original, isn't it..🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BriefcaseMike #DamianGreen  - misleading statements #theresamay et al - manipulating truth  Both = Lying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@louisesdad @PublicStandards Agreed. They'll try the good ol Tory  'Sweep it under the carpet'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@empireofthekop Clearly Suarez knows something we don't...🤔🤨😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@empireofthekop Agree. Couts out for £120m+, Lemar in for £80m+. Re-invest balance into a CB (VvD)  and maybe try for an out and out striker ( Aubameyang?) Let Studge leave. Lemar more than capable filling Couts role, 3yrs younger and under Klopp will only get better<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 Yes Owen 👍🏼 Nick Robinson has been sent out by Tory HQ front and centre to spin this around into a Theresa May positive. Fact is her right hand man, best mate and deputy PM lied to parliament. She hasn't got a leg to stand on. #Boris #Gove and #Davis are buzzin right now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@louisesdad Real issue is these people have no sense of shame. #DamianGreen actually thought he could get away with it, using the tried and tested 'no idea' routine! 😂Now that he has resigned due to lying to parliament, will he have the decency to step aside as an MP too? V much Doubt it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarolineLucas The latter, Times ten 😏 In fact he's actually thinking 'the decks are clearing here, I'm in with a shout ' 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If he's not good enough to be Deputy PM due to fact he gave misleading statements or HE LIED to parliament, then why still good enough for him to be an MP? He accepted his error meaning he DID lie to parliament therefore he should resign as an MP #ThursdayThoughts #Standards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ThursdayThoughts  Green was asked to resign from his post by PM. Plain English - he's sacked. Bigger question is why 'asked' to resign instead of PM categorically dismissing?🤔 severance pay or an honour thing🤨 #DamianGreen #Sacked #ToryTurmoil #TheresaMay #Weak&amp;Feeble<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@indykaila Therefore, we should make the most of him while we can, like we did with Suarez. If they offer and pay the amount we want and it's his wish to go, then cool. LFC will continue and we'll find another Couts. Maybe Woody will get his chance🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@indykaila Not sure about indykaila's info but respect. I get info from Barcelona itself (connections in business)  The 'vibe' is Couts will defo come, is it Jan or June, that's the only debating point. He's defo off<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WarmongerHodges Oakeshott on #bbcqt last night, an absolute joke. Condescending, rude and not a clue what goes on in Barnsley - typical Daily Fail writer.  Brexit or no brexit, her nose is firmly planted on level 2 of Theresa and Davis' arse, Soon to add Mogg<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 1st line - Ask most leavers &amp; they'll say that's EXACTLY what they wanted!! 😂 now we're getting it, you're crying?

<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage SEVEN FAILED ATTEMPTS at becoming an MP have seriously p*ssed him off!! 😂😂 Although the small matter of being a MEP for the last 18yrs, 'm sure that counts as a career politician, as well being the arse who jumped into the deep end without any armbands with Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Definition of Irony.  #Brexiteers voted out as 'parliament is sovereign &amp; we need to take back control of our decisions' Parliament voted Wed to have final say &amp; take back control, as it's Sovereign.

<|startoftext|>@11thEarl @afneil Lol Not last Thurs night on This Week he wasn't.  I like him, he's a funny guy, but to call him unbiased is not fair assumption. He is a Tory and he can't hide it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrizzKhan ....and Couts was half the player he is now before Klopp got hold of him.  Look at Bobby, virtually un-droppable since under Klopp. That's what he can do. Trust him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrizzKhan an opinion, fair doos. think Klopp would do for #Lemar what he did for #Couts ie improve him massively. Has ability no doubt but rather go for #Draxler play either wing, AM, take freekicks &amp; crucially, quicker than Couts. #Salah #Mane have shown us speed is the way forward<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@11thEarl @BBCNews Cheers but doubt it 😉😂 Got rejected for talking sense. Plus they've already got #ToryBots  @bbclaurak @AndrewMarr9  &amp; @afneil I'd have no chance!! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WHAT. AN. A-HOLE. He ACTUALLY THINKS doesn't have to be too clever when discussing deals that will affect GENERATIONS of people, here AND abroad 🤨😲😡 One of THE STUPIDEST comments heard from #Tory minister.  EVER.  #Brexit #BrexitShambles  #ToriesOut #DavisMustGo  https://t.co/rIXIRLUeEV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Word from #Germany   #TheresaMay #DavidDavis  telling porkies to British public re negotiations, saying one thing to #EU behind closed doors, another to us.Tell me something new!!🙄 Dirty #Tories ALWAYS lie 🤬 only interested in #Tory interests, NOT UK's #Brexit #BrexitShambles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@11thEarl Lol @toryboypierce cannot see the woods for the trees. Just another tory elitist toff who seems to think there's a light up Theresa May's arse, and he has to go to it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toryboypierce To hear a #Tory whinging and crying is just great 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bravo #AMC 👏🏼What a truly great episode, on so many levels.

<|startoftext|>absolute shocker, Can't believe it re #KeithChegwin so many childhood memories. Rest in peace fella #swapshop #<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KopKopHoora We all know what the main issue is (CB) and think that will be addressed in Jan, hopefully VVD.  Plus if get a proper striker someone like Auba who'll scare teams, and maybe a DM,  we'll be fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KopKopHoora And he's appointed BY LFC, ergo we trust the manager. Hey dude, you're entitled to your opinion, just think we should have won with what we did today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#LIVEVE 6 million quid a year for #FatSam buys you this Everton. Long balls into touch, two shots in 90mins and 'hope' for a nudge 👏🏼😂 Don't be too happy,  #Relegation is still a possibility<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KopKopHoora Chances we had, We should've won. Lovren had a great game apart from that little nudge, which Calvert made the most off. Yes Couts and bobby 'could' have started but maybe he sees the run of games and thought these lads should have don it,. And they should<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KopKopHoora Lol  I trust the players and If you're a fan, you trust the manager. Salah looked knackered to me so no surprise when bobby came on. Dom-Sol had few nibbles, ox played well, Robbo too, Mané was off it and was telling in his shot when a pass was easier. But kept on due to his pace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#LIVEVE LFC fans need to chill out! Yes we're gutted but we absolutely DOMINATED Everton like never before. THEY DID ZERO! that's all down Klopp tactics and team. We had so many chances, Mané wasted the game defining moment. when that happens, a Lovren mistake can happen 😡 YNWA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KopKopHoora Yes, it is a knee jerk reaction 😂 I'm as gutted as anyone but  We absolutely DOMINATED and should have took the chances. We didn't and that's what can happen<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AnythingLFC_ Meh...Steady nights work  😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@campbellclaret agreed, seems as if Media is actually scared to go after him in a big way 🤔 Any #Labour minister does something of this level of incompetency &amp; the wolves would be released and knives sharpened. What's worse is Labour don't seem to be capitalising as much as they should be<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's seems only time #Tory MPs are interested in what public are saying is when they're up for re-election, where they GROVEL &amp; BEG for votes.

<|startoftext|>So @DavidDavisMP can deflect, lie, misdirect and eventually play the dumb card and nothing will happen 🤔 Contempt of parliament means nothing it seems. It's clear #Tories have no interest in nations welfare, only interested in #Tory welfare #ToriesOut  #ThursdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Classic #Trump  how do you take spotlight away from #RussiaGate #TrumpRussia  etc ? That's right, turn it towards most volatile place on earth #Jerusalem and do something outrageous.

<|startoftext|>@CeliaLauer @jaketapper Even here in the UK, we STILL have some ethics! Seems the day DT turned up, that went right out the window 1st. Fear not, he can only BS for so long. It ALWAYS catches up with you. And in his case,  it'll be probably be something trivial, like with Capone 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CeliaLauer @jaketapper The issue was HRC and DT were both as bad as each other imho. #Sanders should have been the one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CeliaLauer @jaketapper Oh totally. I'm not American (a Brit) but I love America. cannot believe this has happened, and being allowed to continue to happen! Lol However fear not, Mueller has just started. He's got them all lined up, one by one 😉   Next up IMO? KUSH<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hey @Twitter pretty sure I'm not alone in wondering why is it ok for #POTUS to RT fake videos and incite hatred, and you're not doing anything about it? Surely there's a warning in there 🤔 #justsaying  #ThursdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan It's not just about Islamaphobes Piers, he's endorsing Nazis in suits.  As you know, he ain't dumb, But as long as he's got Stephen 'kkk' Miller in his team, we'll see more of this white supremacy stuff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrexitTory_ @piersmorgan It's in Egypt and a political thing between pro and anti mubarak supporters. Is it right? No not at all, but it's got jack to do with religion. However it's been manipulated into something it isn't by BF and now DT has spread it. THAT'S the definition of fake news right there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sajidjavid Actually I should have left a bigger gap, some (most) may want to add more than one word 😉😉😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sajidjavid Saj, sometimes you do come across as a TM puppy 😂 but on this point, regardless of political sides, you're right 👍🏼👏🏼 Trump's an ___________ (choose own word😉)<|endoftext|>

Not sure how any of this is relevant to UK?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrBrendanCox @minxymartin Well said Brendan. He's an A-hole, he doesn't even know the definition of the words Radical and Islamic and Terrorism,  These 3 words just don't sit together at all, they're contradictory. On other hand ' dirty sneaky racist man-child' do sit together in describing him 😉😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes wonder if I'm living in alternate reality, like in #BackToFuture2 Racist Trump is Potus &amp; tweeting like a teen, Dozy May is PM and has no control, UK wants out of EU without a plan, Mourinho is Man Utd manager.  What next??? 🤔🤨🤔🤨 #wednesdaythoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaketapper Actually Jake, don't. There is no way to explain this🤔😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaketapper Slightly confused. A guy gets accused by one person, network fires him. Not tried in court or anything, just took the word of employee. Cool.

<|startoftext|>@empireofthekop At present we can hold our own against most sides, but what city have is that extra thing we don't. Studge is great finisher but lost his edge. Bobby works his socks off &amp; is awesome in a different way, but we need a RAPID striker to put the fear into CBs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@empireofthekop Poss a keeper too. Imho we are potentially 4 players off (plus Keita) being a top top side. Eg. add drax Vvd Keita Auba to Sat's team and it's a different thing all together.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@empireofthekop Yes of course, as well as top CB, DM and a striker.  He'd be v good replacement for Couts, who will eventually leave (Jan or Summer) can play either wing or AM, most importantly at rapid pace. Imagine Mané, Drax and Salah behind striker - oof!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrizzKhan @empireofthekop @thisisanfield @TheRedmenTV  I'm gonna take a really wild guess that #Unsworth ain't getting the job full-time 😂😂😂 #southamptoneverton #LFC #YNWA<|endoftext|>
