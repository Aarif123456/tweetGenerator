<|startoftext|>@TheSundayGame Dublin have gone professional no fault of there own. It's up to the GAA to come up with a solution. Does any level headed Dublin supporter really believe that football is in a good place at the moment.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jerry2623 @aoifegracemoore @irishexaminer You seem to ignore what she did. She's is on a board that promotes Irish tourism, clearly she must have ran out of smart ideas decided to go to Spain during a Pandemic. You must be a hat tipper to people that see themselves on a pedestal. Why is she allowed to break the rules?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jerry2623 @aoifegracemoore @irishexaminer How is she so smart can l ask? If she broke the traveling regulations. Also her job is to endorse Irish tourism while on holiday in Spain during a Pandemic. She put people's health at risk not the smartest idea.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@starryboy14 Your out of touch .The GAA crowd are so cliquey and brainwashed you always back each other up.I was judged harshly and excluded by coaches and players, because l didn't have a certain skill level that ruined my confidence.
