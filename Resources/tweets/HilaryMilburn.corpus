<|startoftext|>@marksimonpowell @JoPlattLeigh @LucyMPowell A third of those who test positive are asymptomatic. This is why mass testing of kids is vital if they are to be in school properly. If they’re negative, then go to school. If positive, home and isolate and let the rest get on with it. Why didn’t Hull get the chance for this??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder 40 yrs ago, we were camping round N Spain &amp; Portugal. We were rather puzzled by the time on the town clock in the first place we stopped in Portugal.

<|startoftext|>@Samfr @DavidGauke It did say that they both carried epipens which would imply they have existing allergies. I’m assuming they agreed to be vaccinated knowing that reactions may well occur - I was asked about various allergies before I had my flu jab the other week.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StephenGarsid17 @BBCr4today May I suggest you look at recent posts by @mark_toshner who is involved in clinical vaccine trials.

<|startoftext|>@stevedudley_ @jonnybirder I’m in my 60s. I had measles badly as a kid because MMR wasn’t available then.

I don’t want C19 and will happily be in the queue for the jab.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FrankRGardner Brilliant programme, Frank, especially in your utter openness about your physical condition. I was going to say ‘utter frankness’ 🙄 Please keep on keeping on. You’re a true inspiration to so many. 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrittonatMarske There’s a novel by Kate Atkinson called ‘When will there be good news?’  I told my OH this morning that at the moment, it seems like the subtitle to my life....🤦🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cjspeechless @HelenReeley @LazyTrollop @ArabellaSock We took the challenge a couple of months ago. Blimey, what a jigsaw. Daylight is certainly beneficial to sort the white from the -err- nearly white 😳😂 I don’t know how long it took but probably well over 12 hours, on and off. #MarshOwl. Now need another one....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrkjduffy Kev - your photos from the rigs have been amazing and we Twitterati are privileged to have seen them, from the tiny Goldcrests to the SE Owls. It’s a shame that #AutumnWatch2020 didn’t do a feature on them to complement their pieces on migration. 🙄🦉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CatAmongPages It’s the wondrous @ANGELACHARDING . Check out her website and shop. The best advent calendars ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kathleennoona14 You’re very welcome. I’m a retired languages teacher and anything wordy is of interest. English place names at times are a killer too. My parents lived near a place called Meopham in Kent, which I eventually discovered wasn’t Mee-o-fam but Mepum 🤦🏼<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>An eloquent demolition job on our leader. Worth the read.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doing my head in 🇺🇸.  BBC News has Biden on 243, Times online 253 and the Guardian online 264. Fake News in there somewhere? Can we all sing from the same results hymn sheet please???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 With the number of fireworks going off round here over the last few nights, too many people seem to have forgotten. Though I think there were numerous pre-Lockdown firework gatherings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 Yes, I don’t disagree. I just think that Biden lacks the necessary charisma and attack. And you need to be an Attack Dog to face up to the Donald. 🤔🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Number10cat Am rather puzzled that the DUP see fit to vote on a purely English issue, or are they joining us in our Lockdown2? #Confused<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 I just so, so wish that the Democrats had found a younger, more vibrant candidate to represent them. And I write as an Oldie.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@trochytracker @jonnybirder Not sure I want to be the elderly person seen on the News being shoved inside their building and the door being nailed shut.

<|startoftext|>If you’re trying to avoid Amazon for books......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RSPBAireValley Thank you. Will do. Though whether I personally live quite close enough to either site to justify a visit is another matter; others do, so it helps them. I’ll just have to cite my #MentalHealth if necessary. 😷😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RSPBAireValley Could you please let us know if any changes have been made to visiting the 2 sites since your last information, in the light of Lockdown2? It’s all very confusing.......<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BTO_GBW @_BTO @BBCSpringwatch Between 12-15 #TreeSparrows most days in the garden near Kirkbymoorside. They take a lot of feeding 😮but are worth every penny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hudsonweather @GTWestYorkshire A fine pair of legs. Dave’s, that is. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder @Railraptor Freight capacity, I think, the argument being moving freight off the roads. But I’m no expert.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaptorPersScot @YoloBirder @sainsburys I don’t think, to be honest, the Estate provenance is a concern for many customers. What IS a concern is the likelihood of its containing Lead Shot. If this is the case, then surely a bigger warning is required, lead being poisonous to humans? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder This is Colin. Well, that’s what we called him. Or her. S/he then moved to the nearby cricket pitch and starred on the local news. What a star.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder Is it Colin the Collingham Hoopoe who kept lots of Yorkshire entertained recently? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeWParker @BorisJohnson Soya sauce Essential item in the Uk shopping trolley.  🙄 And this disregards the fact that most soy sauce bought here is made in the Netherlands. In the EU. So it will be more expensive without a deal. Own goal, whoever publicised this 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder Most people just have a Toilet Duck in their bathroom..... 😳😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_BTO @BTO_GBW A pair of both in the garden near Kirkbymoorside North Yorkshire.  The Marsh Tits are very brave and happy to feed even with humans nearby.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonathanMPomroy @Ryenats @YorksArboretum @nybirdnews @YorkBirding @HawfinchesUK Interesting that the Hornbeam mast is sparse. By contrast, I can’t remember crunching over so many acorns as I have this year. Zillions of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeraldLax1 Ooooooh! Nationally famous at last!! #Autumnwatch #Bitterns 🤗👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayrayner1 I have a rather delicious vision of Sarah Vine making up a packed lunch for Mr Gove. ‘Corned beef &amp; beetroot sarnies, a packet of Hula Hoops and a Mint Club, Michael. Oh and an easy-peel tangerine for later.  That OK? And don’t forget to bring the Tupperware box home!’ 🙄😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesManuell @36bs24ub @AphexGwyn @jayrayner1 If schools’ canteens can run pre-payment cashless till systems that can distinguish between payers and FSM pupils -where I worked a thumbprint was all that was required - then I’m sure the HoC restaurant could determine who’s an MP from who’s a junior civil servant or cleaner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayrayner1 Just to be clear for those who didn’t Google the front page of the Star the other day (which printed the Commons restaurant menu) MPs aren’t relieved of £65 for dinner. Several very appetising main courses apparently come in at £6.41 with the odd one approaching £12. #Subsidy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder This looks very like the bird I saw at the side of the M62 the other Sunday and was confused by. Not a usual Buzzard?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 And our Christmas Cake recipe too. The task has been passed from my Mum to my daughter (bypassing me!) who is making ours next weekend 👍 Delia’s recipes never fail. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder I have been to Aggie. The year I retired from teaching, I said I wanted to be anywhere but Wakey on the first Monday of term. So we went to the Scillies for 5 days. I’d rather like to go back 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder I should think so too Mr Birder. 🙄 😂👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder And again in English? 😂😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder The mind boggles. I’m sure Twitter’s photographers will come to your assistance 🤞🏻🤞🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder A Thing. One of your Things is usually (always!) worth the wait. 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@austinmorley402 @jonnybirder @_BTO I’d like to know if this was discussed with HRH prior to his acceptance of the position. He may well have changed his position re shooting over recent years. If so, that’s fine. If not, it begs big questions. It is an old photo. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisdysonHT @educationgovuk Out of interest, what provision is made for children who are ‘given’ a laptop for remote learning, but whose family home does not have internet access/wifi?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Harvest93573301 If you look at the Covid map for Leeds,  https://t.co/KZfj3TuldA it’s very obvious that the traditional student accommodation areas have a high number of cases. However, the numbers have dropped dramatically in those areas in the last week as the comparison figure shows<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave I don’t care if it’s a set up or not. It’s bloody funny 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bucktonbirder Sadly, yesterday wasn’t our day to see it. Blowing a gale from inland which nearly had me off me feet as we walked from Bempton. Any sensible bird (as per this one and dozens of others) was tucked well out of sight against the wind. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RSPB_OldMoor @Barnsleybsg Sadly I’m not supposed to visit as I live in a (currently) Tier2 area and we are asked not to travel in to a Tier3.  😦Fingers crossed St Aidan’s and Fairburn remain open 😳🤞🏻🦉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@STELUFC74 @Nigel_Farage Nothing for breakfast and lunch but dry toast? Every day? Just look at what you eat and what goes into it.  And what else you have to buy in a week. On this one occasion ever, I’m agreeing with Mr Farage. And I never thought I’d be writing that sentence, Nigel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 Good heavens. That’s got to be a parody account, surely? 😮 If not, it’s the most sensible thing he’s ever said, ever ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissRJRiley FYI 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnLawArt @mn_reeder All to do with greater transmission rates within families apparently. Neighbour’s son went to Uni last month and within a week everyone in his Hall of Res caught it, albeit mild version. I don’t think an hour at Adwick Washlands would have the same effect somehow 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@djonesbutchers . @Number10cat has provided a list of how MPs voted, for those who are interested.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the list of MPs who voted this evening to provide - or not - free school meals for children over the holidays. You may - or may not - be surprised to learn that they voted against.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That it should come to this is beyond belief. 🤦🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 @FlamboroughBird Thanks. I’ll let you know how I get on 😳<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@helenpidd @NParveenG My Northern daughter went to Durham and experienced none of this. Her friends were/still are a mixed bunch from various backgrounds.  Maybe she chose her College more wisely than some. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley That was what I was thinking, but I couldn’t find a pic of the acorns. I just can’t believe how many acorns there are this year. I keep getting them bouncing onto my head when I walk one particular path 😳😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>⁦@rob_yaxley⁩ Evening Mr Y. Could you do me a favour please and ID the tree? I’m assuming it’s a non-native Oak? From our local park. I’ve never seen them before. 🤔🌳  https://t.co/z7HgKi9DUJ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBFlyawayhome @ANGELACHARDING My late Gran was utterly bamboozled by New Money and used to ask why ‘They’ couldn’t just wait until all the old people had died off before introducing it. I never did manage to explain to her why this wasn’t ever going to happen..... 🤦🏼😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BW400CN @helenpidd @Conservatives I don’t think there’s anything « possible » about that. You’ve hit the nail on the head.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ANGELACHARDING I’m not surprised in the slightest. The Marsh Owl kept us busy for hour after hour. And a lovely picture develops as you work. Thank you! 👍😷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ANGELACHARDING Right. That’ll be on the Christmas list. The Marsh Owl was challenge enough, but this one looks mega 😳🤦🏼🙀The dining table will be out of action for weeks......😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyBurnhamGM @helenpidd The fact that the media are told first, before the elected Mayor(s) is totally unforgivable and shocking. This is rapidly turning into a North v South scenario. Johnson seems to be learning nothing. Quelle surprise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rdh_rob @spurnbirdobs It was a really good day, just being “normal” most of the time! I was thrilled seeing 18 Goldcrests feeding on the lawn opposite with Redwing zipping overhead. Time to appreciate the little things, literally. 😷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rdh_rob @spurnbirdobs Likewise! We had left the garden about 5mins before it was bagged. A bloke with a radio told us it was to be released at 1 so we scuttled back and stood in line. With masks on, everyone’s anonymous! Pugneys LOwl is there most days atm for me 👍<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JimAshton_ Why? Who? 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@s8mb @DavidGauke Huge difference btw cafes/restaurants/pubs. Some following all the guidelines. But friends went to pub last Fri- group of 12 blokes arrived. Waitress happily pushed 3 tables together so they could sit as a group. Manager told friends it was fine as they were ‘in a bubble’. 😩😷😤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 There really is no need to have it on a particular date, is there? Maybe look at putting it back a few weeks when matters hopefully should be looking better than they are now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Recordshotmyars @BirdGuides Blimey. We get a few of those Wood Warblers round here. Who knew? 😂🤦🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayrayner1 @PrueLeith Chickens coming home to roost so to speak. Just Chlorinated ones. 😩😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder You’re probably right. I was driving at 60 so had an eye on the road. It had a very pale head and front and grey wings. Not like the usual sitting Buzzards I see. The time of year makes it less likely to be a ✅🤦🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unless I’m very much mistaken, I’ve passed an #Osprey sitting atop a high shrub at the side of the M62 East near #NorthCave. Is this likely? Or did I have more gin than I realised last night? 😳🤪<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wilgils Morning Jan. If you DM me your email address, I have a little anti-Trump music video you’d like. It’s too long for Twitter 😷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 Assume Ms Riley knows about this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanCarter67 @jeanthorpeRR Fair enough. I assumed, wrongly 🤦🏼, that you’d made an official complaint. He obviously doesn’t feel that he has the verbal dexterity required to muster an argument so takes the easy way out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanCarter67 @jeanthorpeRR Looks like you’re complaining to the wrong person. He’s a NT Estate Manager and states his views are his own. I assume he’s not up for an argument. Better to target your questions at the higher echelons and await their standard answer 🤔🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 Err...... Stick to the Day Job, Sarah. The one you’re brilliant at 🙀😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaynesEspresso Just seen you on BBCNews. You are our cafe of choice when we come through to Leeds. Best coffee in the city. Sincerely hope that you can ride out this crisis. Good luck and best wishes. 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThrosThrosThros @ANGELACHARDING I must admit I buy a new one each year, save it in the Christmas decorations crate and bring it out the following year. Doesn’t matter that the windows are open. So they get dotted about the house 🙄😉Win win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jgsigsworth @helenpidd Once a French teacher, always a French teacher. Now tuck your shirt in! 🙄😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marksmith1986 Yes indeed they were when we were there around lunchtime. People just sat entranced by the bird. It was quite hypnotic watching it feeding, and the bird was totally unfazed by an audience who kept a sensible distance. #YorkshireHoopoe<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RoutledgeSteve Was your Missus suitably impressed, Steve?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoutledgeSteve 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoutledgeSteve Drive into C. From Harewood, look on your right for a load of cars parked road side and a little turning circle opp. From Wetherby just past Tesco. Pitch is right by roadside. Easy parking. 👍<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RoutledgeSteve  It’s here. Ridiculous. 10 metres from its public!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoutledgeSteve Once seen, never forgotten. Last seen by us in a little car park in NW Cyprus 😳 The bird with the best Latin name #UpupaEpops 🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoutledgeSteve We’re in Leeds then going to Harrogate so it seems the obvious thing to call in to Collingham en route. 🤞🤞Thanks 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can anyone point me at the location of the #Collingham #Hoopoe this morning please?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jgsigsworth @AlexGlendinning Hmm. That’s a bit beyond me, Graham. I’m assuming you mean it’s a good place to start? 🤔😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StansaidAirport It was worth the wait. Nice one. Missed your wit and repartee. 😉👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ossettbrewery Any ideas? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UoLperegrine @MoorlandMonitor Thanks for that. I do think that some form of industrial mowing is a better alternative if ‘regeneration’ is necessary.  Burning cannot continue, surely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Northern_Bobby A little advice. “Never argue with an idiot. They drag you down to their level and then beat you with experience.” Mark Twain. 🙄🤪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UoLperegrine I’d be interested in a similar study on air pollution in those areas. Driving past a NYorks valley where smoke is drifting thru like a blanket is a sobering sight. Still can’t believe it’s legal from an air quality aspect. @MoorlandMonitor<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@borobarrister 2/2. Understand as well that huge numbers were wiped out in bad storms over the Med at crucial times. That may account for the 3 we got, instead of the 20+ we usually see every year. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@borobarrister We’ve had hardly any. I despaired. Then we went to Wortley nr Penistone to cycle the TransPennine Trail, parked by a big riding stables. There were dozens &amp; dozens of Swallows, with many youngsters. The wires were heaving with them and they buzzed the yard and fields 👍🤗 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave @Barnsleybsg Panic not. I had a call from the lovely @GeraldLax1 giving me its then precise location 👍😉Trust it doesn’t beggar off in the next hour or so......🙀<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BrittonatMarske 👍No doubt they’d be happy to still have lead in their paint, petrol and plumbing. Think there was a reason why that no longer happens 🤔The ethos of Countryfile for me is too often encapsulated by the inevitable ‘smiling Hedgehog’ or similar on their calendar. Twee but unreal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrittonatMarske Not sure of your description of them being bad guys. Surely they’re the good guys, but it’s #Countryfile whitewashing the pig industry so to speak. They rarely show nature red in tooth and claw as the saying goes, but sanitise the countryside and food production.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@helenpidd Total inconsistency is not good. Passed 2 barbers this am. One with staff in visors, customers in masks, door open.

<|startoftext|>@patjack67 @LegoLostAtSea I had one as a kid. Very common toy in the 50/60s. Water whistle. It burbled rather than trilled, so not very convincing as bird song!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Well yes. Whenever we do Lake or Peak District fells, I always say, well at least there’ll be an ice cream van/Starbucks/McDo at the top 🤪like on Snowden.

<|startoftext|>@damian_money Signed. We see this so often on our regular trips up to North Yorkshire.  15 fires burning one afternoon last year, with smoke drifting for miles. How it can be allowed even as an air pollution problem alone is beyond me.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@archers1847 @rosschawkins @BBCr4today I don’t think for a second, that the job was advertised, short-list drawn up, interviews held. You don’t need any of rubbish when cronyism rules.

<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @WakeyBirders @MyWakefield Well the bridge is the tyres that have been there for ages, rearranged. The fishing doesn’t surprise me. I’m assuming it’s illegal?

<|startoftext|>@WildJustice_org @UKChange Is this cartridge being marketed thus in the U.K.? If so, surely it is an illegal advert/product here?

<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder But like a lot of academic subjects, it’s the brain-training that’s important. Makes you think differently/rationally/carefully and learn to concentrate on details.

<|startoftext|>⁦@simmonite_dave⁩ Several of these quite high on Bleaklow Moor above Glossop today. Could you ID pls? Taken before I crippled myself on OH’s 69th birthday 12 mile walk. He’s fit as a lop. I’m not 😩🤪  https://t.co/jnQVJY21Gl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder They’ve been here for the last few days, but there seems to be a bigger number of them. They’re not prospecting, just feeding. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder Couple of hundred Swift feeding over the rape fields below the Castle. No screamers though. Amazing sight 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Natures_Voice Pair of Spotted Flycatchers in our cottage garden in North York’s. Also Robin youngsters, Wren, Chaffinch, Tree and House Sparrows plus young, baby Bluetits, Great Tit, Song Thrush giving a snail a good thrashing, Blackbird and the usual Woodpigs. Not bad for an hour’s watching.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Cleckbirder Well, bog standard when you know exactly where you’ll see them. We’ve pulled over on an empty road to watch a group of them hopping and lurching around a dead sheep in a field, picking the bones. Totally oblivious of us. Not the prettiest 😳Nature’s dustbins!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder I can see our house on the third one if I squint a bit 😂👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cleckbirder What has the BOU said? I’ve seen them in Spain/France and they are spectacular. Friends in deepest Andalusia get bog standard vultures by the dozen wheeling over their local tip, and picking over the odd dead sheep.... 😳😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cleckbirder Worth the hike then?? 😳😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@fairburnjohng @RSPBAireValley It’s prob not a problem for many people, but lack of loos is preventing a lot of folk from planning a day out. A friend has Crohn’s and dare not step outside if they know they can’t access a loo in an ‘emergency’. Bolton Abbey had all theirs open a month ago, also RHS HarlowCarr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RSPBAireValley Any info when you might get the loos open please? The older one gets, the more difficult it is to commit to an afternoon, or longer,  out. Many of us visit both St Aidan’s and Fairburn, and facilities are shut at both. #CrossedLegs<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Dozens of #Swift and #HouseMartin feeding low over the rape fields behind our house. 👍 Even the odd #Swallow, which have been in woefully short supply this year. We’ve seen 3, whereas there are usually 20+ at their annual nesting place at the farm #Pugneys<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@fmlillibeth @paulwaugh If I understand it right, this is trying to work out who infected you, or where you picked it up, rather than (or as well as) who you might infect. That may well uncover a superspreader. It seems obvious really to do this, as Japan does. So why has it not been done earlier?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder How was the flight?? 😳😷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder May see you there. We’ve planned to go tomorrow as of last weekend, thinking Puffins would be the draw.... Might make parking interesting 😳<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder 🤦🏼Yet another family living in the EU voting for Brexit without understanding how it would very much affect them. Surely to god they would’ve researched the consequences of their vote better, rather than just doing the knee-jerk. But on reflection that requires common sense 🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BBCr4today The Prime Minister became Prime Minister without much of a clue about how to do the job. He still hasn’t much of a clue. David Frost should fit right in with his lack of experience for an important role. 🤦🏼<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HopkinsBRFC @gaviniorr How that cyclist is still alive after pulling a stunt like that beats me. I turned left off a main road last week to “meet” a group of lads all pulling wheelies on my side of the road. Good job I was quick on the brakes. They were clueless and a danger to all concerned. #immortal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wakeyweir86 @WakeyBirders Thanks Martin. I walked round the lake to the ‘gap’ opposite the little hide &amp; could see them at the far side of the Reserve Lake. I then walked round to the big hide but didn’t go in - there was a group of teens in there and I didn’t fancy confronting them by myself 🙄😳#Pugneys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wakeyweir86 @WakeyBirders Where were the Blk wits, Martin? We’ve been avoiding our usual Pugneys patch as it’s been so crowded, especially certain parts round the lake where the path is narrow. The one way system isn’t... 🤦🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@borobarrister @Markthebirder Thanks. Learn sthg new every day if you ask politely 👍 I assumed they were non-breeders. Still have 50+ here over the rape fields with some #HouseMartins. Don’t work too hard!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@borobarrister @Markthebirder Right. So that’s the why, which is good. But where? Why the East coast and not due South? I’m just confused here 🙄🤦🏼<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GlavesLiam @BBCSheffield @PHEngland You’ve obviously not seen the numerous pictures of litter dropped near an empty bin.  Or the pics of tents, chairs, (and a suitcase!) food, bottles etc left in remote Haweswater in the Lakes, where no litter bin should be because nobody should be camping there. #scumbags<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephBirdArt @jonnybirder And the #nox containers are turning up everywhere. OH cycles and regularly sees them in piles at the side of roads as well as in lay-bys. A growing problem in several ways. 😦<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephBirdArt @jonnybirder One prob is the lack of suitable bins as here. Either an industrial wheeled skip/bin, or what the annual Ryedale Show does. Stake open several builders’ bags which hold huge amounts. OR even better, get that deposit scheme finally sorted on cans and bottles - it’s been sidelined.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@flako1959 We’d gone in the vain hope of finding a PiedFly. One way system along the Strid so did the walk from Riverside car park to Bardon then thru the wood. No sign with us both looking. We were nearly at the top when I noticed a female with a full beak 1//2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jayrayner1 I’d be quite happy to give my details to the restaurant/café etc. in case they were needed for Tracing purposes. I can just imagine some folk, however, giving ridiculous names or wrong phone numbers to be awkward, thinking it’s an imposition or for ‘a laugh’.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IanMorrisJump Horses for courses. It may not be good idea for hill walking, when a map is a must have.

<|startoftext|>@birdsandbike @sconebirding Exactly what I was about to advise. We’re plagued with 4 cats belonging to neighbours, which treat our garden with contempt to put it politely.

I can’t find this information anywhere. Millions of voters are likely to be disenfranchised by today’s vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StansaidAirport ........😳😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Which day suits? The weather is on and off showers, and I’m spoken for on Friday, but apart from that... you’re the one with work commitments, so your shout.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder What’s about half way? Anglers?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder I could do with meeting up with you at some point to give you the Borage plants. And some pond weed if you want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Stand back and wait for occupants 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Was talking to a chap who was there when you found the Sanderling Stint. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning I stood on the mound to the left of the Obs and so could see the feet of the cattle further up. As they moved, a yellow bird flashed up, flew along with them and dropped back in. Case of right place etc 🙄👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning No Stint visible today, but Wood Sand, Sedgie and Yellow Wag ticks for me. Sad to see Crows predating the Avocet nests. Good to see 20+ House Martins scooping mud on the dried up flash #Adwick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Bluddy Hell. Priti Patel has been doing the maths again 🤦🏼😂😜<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MyWakefield Just an idea... Lots of places around the area are being abused at the moment, sadly. 😷😤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bobhogrunner @teesbirds1 @teesmouthbc @teeswildlife @nybirdnews @Natures_Voice Did they not offer to shift the dumped tyres? 🙄 Sadly, too many people are totally Nature-illiterate. They like a bit of fresh air - indeed they need it - but apart from that, what else is happening along their walk is immaterial, inconvenient and Not Their Problem Mate. Sad. 🤦🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please take a minute to read this and then retweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FullFact @fairburnjohng Thanks. This question has been raised at least twice at the #dailybriefing and the response has been a vague, “Oh, it’ll soon be obvious that they are genuine.”  Which I find worrying as it takes bottle for many people to challenge someone’s “authority”. #TestTrackAndTrace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder @WakefieldSwifts Large number of #Swifts with #HouseMartins very high over the fields below #SandalCastle at the moment. 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayrayner1 @russelltovey I hope you told Russell that the scene by the Thames where, as John Chivery, he proposed to, and was rejected by, Little Dorrit, remains one of the most heart-rending and poignant scenes on TV. Sublime acting. I wept buckets and that’s not my style! 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mn_reeder Dead swan?? This virus seems to have affected some “unaffected” people’s wits. It’s as if social responsibility has gone out the window when they leave the house and step into Nature. Litter, bbqs, places trashed, dogs uncontrolled- some BAD photos of late 😩😷<|endoftext|>

Litter is a perennial problem and it’s the same thing here - it’s about it being someone else’s job to tidy up after them and it drives me wild.<|endoftext|>

They would leave the place as a tip, and when I confronted them, the attitude was, ‘Well, it’s the cleaners’ job to tidy up. That’s why we have cleaners.’ This sense of entitlement from 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley One more day to go up here......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your opinion, Mr Hudson?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Is the car park on the road open? I assume so. Don’t like parking by the houses if I can avoid it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@loz_beaumont @MyWakefield It’s a safety thing not virus. Some local water bodies currently have blue green algae which is not good; all are far colder than people realise. So you’re right, but people ignore notices. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SBillcliffe @CroftonBirder @MyWakefield @Wintersett1 @WakeExpress I dread to think what state #Pugneys was like by last night. The place was rammed. Car park full and cars parked all along the verge on Asdale Rd. Bins available but not enough for the thousands who were there 😳😷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bucktonbirder @NYPRuralTF @BBCCountryfile A good piece on #Countryfile, Mark. A pity that the apologist for the game keepers stated that “sweeping statements” had been made, accusing them all, when in fact it was clearly laid at the door of a minority.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave @jonnybirder Yes. Doable. And safe for Delilah too. Plants in perforated square aquatic pots. I’ve got plenty pond weed if you want it. You can buy plants at garden centre; I bought perf. pots online 50p each (ish) or at garden centre too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickBenbow2 @sarahjolly1 I think it will very much depend on how much pressure the parents are under to return to their jobs. And when the Gov decides, possibly arbitrarily, that the 2 metre rule is redundant and 1 metre is fine..... 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave Thank you for that. We get a lot more moths in the little garden at Marton - a lot more insects full stop as we’re not next to a field repeatedly sprayed by the farmer. It’s very noticeable.  If only we could visit atm. Next, investigate moth traps. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 Some scary photos yesterday of seaside places - Durdle Door in particular. Scary because too many people seem to think it’s all over. Mr Cummings and sunshine have not been a good mix. 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave I’m going to have to get myself a moth trap I think. That Ermine is quite spectacularly beautiful. How on Earth do you begin to ID them, though, from a standing start of ignorance? 🤦🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mn_reeder 🙄Not just me then #pedant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Pugneys Covid-19 capital of #Wakefield. Avoid if possible as it was rammed today.  Too many people seem to think they’re immune, judging by the size of some groups. I’m staying well away for a while despite it being my local patch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UKrubbishwalks The quiet lanes round the top of our local Country Park are seriously littered with lager and cider cans. Far more than usual. You can see where the COVID parties are being held in the evenings by the amount of empties left each time. #PugneysCP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you’ve not come across Mr Spicer yet - and why is that? - then spend 5 minutes watching this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 “In my opinion” x3. More bottle than the rest of them put together.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley That’s what I thought, but it’s worth asking. The froglife site is very informative, but I particularly liked your photo of the dug area which shows the levels very clearly. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley Out of interest, what’s the benefit of underlay as a top layer? Does it hold soil in place better for planting or is it to protect the liner? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley Thank you for that. Worth it in the end! We could’ve had a pond-building competition a la Eurovision judging by the number of folk who took the Lockdown opportunity to dig up their gardens! @simmonite_dave<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder You’ll be needing another haircut soon at this rate!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BpsmithUk @jonnybirder The number 324 was deaths reported yesterday. We do not get a clear picture of daily deaths as some were deaths days or even weeks ago. The stats are very unclear, which doesn’t help matters. Some people - too many- seem to think it’s all over for some reason 😩😷Too much sun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watched a strange thing. Magpie on apex of garage roof, eating a very large frog. Body eaten, legs remaining. It’s then hopped down the roof and tucked the remains under some ivy growing over the roof, arranging the ivy carefully to conceal the frog, and flown off. No camera<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1   A better explanation than mine. Coronavirus excess deaths: UK has one of highest levels in Europe  https://t.co/YF0dXTflKF<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning I’ve seen people wild swimming/training before in the pub lake but not in the reserve (😂) lake. We saw the white thing (fridge?) and wondered how the hell someone got it that far and WHY?? Asked a ‘lady’ not to let her dog swim in the res lake yest and 😳🤦🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley I could do with an eye test🙄 I’ll bob down tomorrow. Just a 4 hour drive at best. 😷<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@south_birder That’s fine. Thank you for looking. If you have a partner etc with a suitable phone, you can both input your data and ask them to log in for you daily as there’s an easy facility for a second reporter. It takes 5 mins to set you up and literally 30 secs daily. 3 extra q’s weekly.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BBCr4today Do Gov ministers ever get out and about? There’s been groups of up to a dozen wandering around, and sitting in, our local Country Park for the last two or three weeks. Ever since ‘Alert’ became the slogan, things started to fall apart round here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 We went out and sang! One guitar, two ukes and about 30 neighbours, all suitably distanced. We’re quite a mixed bunch and it’s been a good opportunity to keep an eye on each other, as well as showing our appreciation for #Pinderfields Hospital. 😷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CliveMyrieBBC Thank you once again for a series of eloquent, poignant and incisive portraits of life in the C19 wards. Difficult but essential viewing. Deep respect, as before with your NZ and Sri Lanka reports. Stay safe. 😷#bbcnews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley That would be good. There’s no rush 😳😷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley Thank you. We have had a pre-formed pond for years which we’re thinking about changing into a free form one. Not yet obv while it’s full of tadpoles. Looks like I need to do some (a lot of) investigation 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley What do you mean by underlay? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayrayner1 Not quite sure how the #Telegraph readership will take that news, Jay. It’ll be because “the entire Durham Constabulary are a load of whinging remoaners”, no doubt. 😷So, what next- up before the beak on Zoom?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning That’s an interesting camping kettle! 🙄😉😩As they say, people can manage to carry heavy items to their picnic, but struggle to carry the empties back to the car/bin/home. Pathetic. No excuse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 I’m not claiming that’s right, just what I think it is. I’ll do some digging after my walk. Hope you’re well 😷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 I think it’s the number of excess deaths compared to the norm?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rosschawkins @BBCr4today I’m furious about DC and the PM. However, we all need to “take the moral high ground” and be better than them. WE need to be responsible, despite them. What a sad, reprehensible situation to be in. Oh for a morally responsible Gov.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_BTO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Natures_Voice @BBCSpringwatch We regularly see Red Kite over Sheepscar Junction, a major road junction just outside Leeds centre.  Our daughter often sees them drifting over her house in North Leeds. They are returning to being urban and city birds, as they were in the 1660s when Pepys was writing his diary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillyPlusOne Not forgetting Neville’s Cross. And a lot of us are Bloody Livid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayrayner1 No messing. She read the runes and realised what needed doing. Then did it pronto. If that had happened here......🤔🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WYP_CNewsome @UoLperegrine Thanks for your efforts. Why anyone would want to shoot such a magnificent bird beggars belief. Also v worrying that someone was in Brighouse with a loaded gun 😩😷<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rdh_rob Funnily enough, I went across to Swilly on Wednesday for the first time since March 17. And I felt so much better for seeing the place again, despite the place being much busier than usual.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>All together now.......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCSpringwatch @Natures_Voice Came across a small #Hedgehog on our walk this aft. By a popular path for dog walkers, in full sun. Looked rather sorry for itself so did my best- moved it down the banking into a crop field and into shade. 🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Catherine Hamlin obituary  https://t.co/OpcEczOkSr If you’ve had enough of the sorry state of politics atm, and want inspiration, then read this. What an utterly, utterly remarkable woman. Why have I never heard of her before now?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@labbieboy @RichSpecials @NYorksPolice @RichmondshireDC @RishiSunak If only there were a bin nearby.  Oh, wait........ 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Could’ve been even worse. They could’ve chucked it all in the river. The message by Police about not visiting beauty spots isn’t having much effect! Not surprising seeing as lots of folk seem to think Lockdown is ended. #SecondWave<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Still rubbish at distinguishing between Garden W and Blackcap. Tin eared!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning I think it’s an extension thereof, so to speak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @WakeyBirders Hear a Cettis making noise every time I walk near the sluice at top end of #Pugneys 👍Need a walk to CW. Was the Sedge near the screen?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning The second photo is quickly sorted. The first most certainly isn’t. Where exactly? 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Bloody typical 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlokSharma_RDG They were indeed answered in some detail, Mr Sharma. The fact that those details were ridiculous and barely credible did little to calm the anger felt - and still felt- by millions. I feel very sad to be “led” by an increasingly morally bankrupt government. 😷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Blimey. I’d have been thrilled! What were you expecting? A pair of Cranes? 🙄😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Mallards on your roof?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RishiSunak Yes he explained himself. However, he expressed no regret for his actions. No appreciation that many, many people have endured far, far worse than his family, while maintaining the rules that HE helped develop. Dom “Do as I say, not as I do” Cummings. #Shameful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayrayner1 They say there’s no such thing as Bad Publicity.  I suspect that the residents of #BarnardCastle might disagree 😷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andyhood75 That’s what we assumed. Not that we see any.  It’d obviously been there for quite some time; on a Fox run between gardens. Thanks.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PippaCrerar I’m rather hoping that @DurhamPolice are, as I write this, trawling through the ANPR cameras for the M1/A1 for the relevant days. Trust that the accusation of lying by No10 has got their dander up, as they say. Go to it, Durham Constabulary 👍😷<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@leedsbirder @UoLperegrine @UoL_Sus @LeedsNews So this also implies that some scrote has been wandering the town with some form of gun during lockdown. Friend had been following the birds and was thrilled to see them locally, often on the silo climbing wall. Beggars belief.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachelstevenson @helenpidd His wife’s sister lives in London apparently. She would’ve been their first call, surely. Look after yourself and your family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jgsigsworth Noooo! I taught French for years and until ‘it’ happened, used to teach grammar lessons to Y6 at a local Primary (KS2 SATs require quite detailed grammar knowledge 😳) during my volunteer day. I do know how to make it fun, really 🤪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley @norfolktreeally I can’t recall seeing so many green leaves on the ground before. Very strange.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@helenpidd Either No10 are lying by saying DC and family were NOT spoken to by the Police, or Durham Constabulary officers are lying by saying that they spoke to the family and advised them etc etc. They can’t both be right 😳😷Public confidence in the probity of No10 falling by the minute.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley  Just back from a walk round local woodland this aft. Been blowing a gale for 2 days and v v dry. Paths seriously littered with green leaves esp Sycamore and Oak. Assume it’s stressed trees trying to lighten the load?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Ooooh. That looks a bit of a bugger to complete - pink, grey scale and white. Good luck with that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this thread proves, once again, that the person with the most common sense in Downing Street is indeed Larry the Cat. A brilliant summary of the case against Dom ‘Do as I say, not as I do’ Cummings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayrayner1 I’m even more upset to discover that Rishi seems unaware that those two sentences should be separated by a semi-colon, not a ‘comma splice’. That’s him gone down in my estimation 🙄🙄🤦🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 I haven’t seen the Bullfinches in their usual area here at #Pugneys. Usually to be found in the trees and high hedgerow along the beck but neither sight nor sound in recent weeks 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@haywood_russ @dannyfardell1 @Wintersett1 @fairburnjohng @mn_reeder @JohnLawArt Hmm.

<|startoftext|>@WfldPeregrines @WakeyBirders I do wish they’d just stick to bringing pigeons back to the nest. Feral or Woodpigs - doesn’t matter. There’s loads of both in the fields behind our house. Not many Mipits though, if any. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning You’ve got our fledglings! They flew the nest early one morning and we never saw them again 🙄And after we’d watched them build the nest and fly in and out feeding, for what seemed like weeks. Typical.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Erm - forgive me for asking, but aren’t we supposed NOT to be in each other’s houses? Seems to me that half of us are doing the right thing, and the other half doing as they please ‘but what’s the harm?’  That second wave is on its way.😳😷🤦🏼 Not enough Lerts about for my liking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Pugneys Just a head’s up that there’s a clockwise One Way system in place around the main lake. Might not suit some, but it makes things easier at the narrow path near the hide, where there’s nowhere to step aside. Or just avoid the place altogether! 😷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@d4ws89 @SuffolkGazette Ummmm 🤔 We didn’t pick Boris or even vote for him. That was the 92k paid up members of the Conservative Party. And most of us don’t listen to him either.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Evening all who advised me on my #SwarovskiOptik query.

<|startoftext|>@Baltzersens Don’t beat yourselves up. Some of us would’ve waited forever for that brunch. Nobody expects perfection at the moment. 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 Don’t bother. It’ll seed itself and next year will pop up exactly where it wants to be. We had half a dozen - now scores of them, which have generously hopped next door too! 😳🤦🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayrayner1 Eat Asparagus! Lots of producers here in Yorkshire usually sell to restaurants, struggling due to lost markets. I used to think it was difficult. Put a layer in a frying pan, cover with boiling water,  simmer for 5 mins. Drain, serve with melted butter and eat with your fingers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wakeyweir86 @Barnsleybsg @WakeyBirders Hi Martin. Where’s Rabbit Ings please?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mn_reeder We are very short of Swallows here. They usually congregate at local farm buildings for nesting but the max I’ve seen so far is 3 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AddeyNick @BlokeDenaby We get all sorts growing beneath our bird feeders. Millet, various unidentifiable grains, carrots one year, and then last year, a rather vigorous plant that I had to double check on google..... hemp seeds in the mix, obviously 😳🤦🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wakeyweir86 @WakeyBirders Yes, I know. I don’t see enough Garden Warblers to recognise the difference between them and Blackcaps. I assume they’re all Blackcaps .....🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Baltzersens Saw our daughter for the first time in 8 weeks this afternoon, and she brought Cinnamon Buns, Croissants and Pains au chocolat (via George and Joseph).  A double treat!! 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrownHawker The poor Desert Wheatear at Whitby Winter 2018-19 ended up as early breakfast for a Kestrel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wakeyweir86 @WakeyBirders Where is this? Is it the old railway under Barnsley Road between Seckar and NMDam woods? I need to sort out my Blackcaps from Gardens 😳🤪 Was in Sekar Woods this aft. Yellowhammer on the heathland👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomnorris70_3 @Maternityatpht Well done Corrina! And thanks to @Maternityatpht for getting you through. And congrats to you too, Tom. I’ll be on the phone to G and M later. They’ll be “made up” as they say here. 💐🥂👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning We walked the Wetlands 1st week of Lockdown; it was virtually empty. The ‘farmer’ was mowing the top end around the lake side. We were totally baffled. It was benefiting nobody, certainly not the wildlife -just encourages people to walk along the lake edge and disturb the birds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WYP_CNewsome @jonnybirder I’m afraid my experience is that you can’t ask a dog owner to be responsible for their dog without getting a mouthful of abuse in return.  The rights of their dog are paramount.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning It was scarified late last year and we could see the patch looked different. Then the mad mowers were out, scalping everywhere but left that area. And suddenly, poppies and what look like cornflowers or similar have appeared. Maybe the whole central strip could be the same?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuffolkGazette @YoloBirder 😱😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder That’s what happens when there are fewer eyes in isolated places. Which equally, paradoxically, should help narrow down the culprits 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder Hmmmmm. Maybe things were different in 1990!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnLawArt @BirdwatchExtra @YWT_North That was the appeal I think<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Cf #Pugneys. Carpark open Loads of people this aft including a group of 15. - 7 adults, 8 kids- who surrounded us by the Pugneys bridge. Not one Lert among them 😤🤪😷Too many people being very unaware of their space.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been out in the car for my weekly shop. Serious amount of traffic on the roads around Wakey.  There must be a lot of Garden Centres open 😳😷PS Wakey residents- Hampsons on DenbyDale Road is still SHUT so don’t bother trying to turn in and block thd road. 🙄🤪<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@flako1959 @maltingsyork One thing that has been regularly said about the PM is that he doesn’t do detail and has a short attention span.

<|startoftext|>@MrMichaelSpicer And that’s just putting the bins out 😷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dozens of #HouseMartins, #SandMartins and #Swallows skimming over the main lake #Pugneys this afternoon.  Brisk northerly wind meant very few humans out and about for a change.  Physical Distancing mainly around 500 metres. 👍#StayAlert 😷 #NoMeNeither<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuffolkGazette Be alert. We always need more lerts. 🙄 #meaningless #waffle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chrisheppell1 @flako1959 I don’t think they’re suited to dry and sandy. Mine have been a bit wilty in this recent prolonged heat in our clay  soil in a shady border. They get the washing up water chucked on them as a treat. #Astrantia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder @Wintersett1 Our Swallows are very late arriving. Only 3 best number at Castle farm 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave @Mike_Rann @Wintersett1 The problem being that they were hand picked to Get Brexit Done. A narrow selection process that involved booting out the thinkers and questioners.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder Welcome back young man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leedsbirder @LeedsNews @WestYorksPolice Yes but were they 2 metres apart? Not exercise as I know it 🙄🙄🤪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning There’s a Cettis by Pugneys main lake. It seems to be in a tightish area from the scrub across the path from the Sluice to half way along that top bank parallel to the otter fence. I hear it every time, regardless of time of day 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning This was going to be my 200 year. I’d started well and we’d decided to do some long weekends in various U.K. locations to rack the numbers up. And then....😷Stalled on 119. Bugger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave Good job it didn’t cross paths with the visiting White-tailed Eagles 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @DarraghHudson I’ll keep my eyes open for it. I wonder if it’s the same one that occasionally takes up residence at the little lake in Thornes Park?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave Flamborough to Aberdeen in 2 days! Remarkable. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Was the Mandarin at the motorway end? @DarraghHudson saw it there a few days ago. And I’ll have to examine the RPs/LRPs to see which is which.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@flako1959 What do you want sending?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder I’ll donate as long as you promise NOT to wear your hat for a while..... 😂🤪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 What variety is the first one? I do occasional battle with vine weevils with mine. First inkling that they’re not growing properly, I tip them out to investigate. The record is 21 grubs in one pot. 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LevParikian Erm, could they not have put up another sign well before the roundabout? Are the big yellow arches not tall enough to be seen from miles around? I despair.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KayeHorsfield The sculptures aren’t free-standing. They are carved into the facade of the building so “sculpture” here gives the wrong impression.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrahamFAppleton @vismigKC @BirdTrack @DEBALMER Here in Wakefield we have 3 at the farm behind the house. One appeared a good fortnight ago, then 2 more last week. They nest in the old barns, usually in their dozens. We’re rather puzzled by the lack of numbers as yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 Sandwiches. The only answer! 🙄😷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 How would you cope in your little kitchen? A restricted menu I imagine 🤔😷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 I think many y6 would find Physical Distancing hard enough, never mind the tinies. And some of the more aware ones would get very wound up and tearful if another kid came too close, and get stressed. How do you stop 5 yo kids holding your hand, grabbing you, being tactile? 🤔🤔😷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley @glabra90 Yes, but there isn’t a bird called a Common NorthNorfolkSubsoilpiper 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glabra90 @rob_yaxley More likely to have builder’s sand. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@borobarrister Our Robins fledged early yesterday ... and have promptly disappeared, adults included. The adults appear to be three gardens down. And there’s a cat next door 😱😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PAABaxter @Bucktonbirder YWT used coir mats pre-populated with Marsh Marigolds on a section of the beck by #Pugneys last year. The beck flooded about 2 metres above usual level over winter. It’s now at normal and the MMs have survived and are flowering. Remarkable. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 Good idea. Ginger and rhubarb always go together. Or rhubarb and orange. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 I’m going to try this with rhubarb from down the garden 👍👍😋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Around 50 #Swift and assorted other Hirundines zipping around the main lake at #Pugneys this morning. One was so low and close, it nearly took my eye out 😳Fantastic to see them and their aerobatic display 👍 Grey Wagtail the only other notable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrembirding Tourist! Remind me? 😷😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our garden Robins are STILL feeding their chicks in the nest. We can’t see what’s happening as they’re deep in the ivy.  This has been going on for weeks! Convinced the parents have the nestlings in #Lockdown 😳😷How much longer??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WildHorizons_ @JimAshton_ Near where my daughter lives are some allotments. A tree surgeon (?) regularly dumps a huge pile of wood chippings on the wide verge nearby. Within a couple of days, they disappear, as local residents come along with shovel and sacks and take them for their gardens. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 That answers that one then. Short lived perennial makes sense. We have a gravel garden at the front and they seed themselves like crazy in there 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 I have one border that, until last year, had dozens of aquilegia of all colours. Then last year- only 2 or 3 appeared Lots of seedlings, but the parent plants had disappeared. Don’t know if they have a “life span”?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave I was only joking. I’ve never eaten rabbit in my life as I used to keep them when I was a kid. Akin to eating my pet cat I reckoned 😢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave Rabbit pie! 😱😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirdTrack It’s ok. We’ll just sit on the sofa and wait, rather like waiting for a car MOT      Time is a fluid concept these days 😂😷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 Rather like the green and purple (top LH pic). Very unusual 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>⁦@flako1959⁩ Indeed! A rather ....err .... promiscuous wee plant. Hardly any of mine were deliberate planting, Nora Barlow aside. The others seem to have happily inter-bred.

<|startoftext|>@wilgils I used to be a regular listener but gave up a year or so ago. The scripts got so lame and unlikely, with people disappearing without a trace or a word. No mention of Brexit from farmers? No mention of C19? Lala land. #Ambridge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fisermanian A tern. Or A for Arctic? 😂👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 Yes. Guess what got in the way of the lessons of Cygnus? Brexit. All hands to that pump and Cygnus forgotten. And PHE didn’t push hard enough for its recommendations to be sorted.  As for the haircut, hairdressers will suddenly become Key Workers shortly. The nation is desperate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959  https://t.co/r58OEl7qx2 Not a happy read. You have been warned 😩😷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SwaledaleBirds Darwinism in action, methinks. #westminsterbridge 😷😷🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @MyWakefield Panic not. Like Arnie, it’ll be back. you don’t get rid of dandelions by mowing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cathari18465929 @lewis_goodall We needed a #Jacintha. No messing with her. Swift lockdown, and a firm and decisive approach. She read the coming storm and didn’t hesitate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@borobarrister @RSPBEngland I saw and heard one last year at #BoltonAbbey along with Pied Flycatchers, Nuthatches, Treecreepers, Dippers, Common Sands, Mandarins etc. Our annual pilgrimage. Will we get there this year?? 😷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @MyWakefield You’ll be thrilled to know, Alex, that someone has had time to come round our estate, spraying the grass at the base of trees, and along the edges of the tarmac path between Pugneys and past Portobello.  UTTERLY unnecessary, especially in the light of the fly tipping going on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@borobarrister Well, we’ll be round and about in the garden in the next few days when they fledge - on cat and Magpie duty 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MyWakefield<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@borobarrister Our Robin pair have built their nest in the thick ivy on our garage. They disappear into the foliage but we can’t tell what’s happening - we’re sure they’re feeding babies as they’re constantly active. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lordjusticewolf @davidwalliams @MattHancock To NHS Charities. I’d quite like Prof Whitty to be present. Just not a politician.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SwaledaleBirds @NightSkyLantern Rather a mealy mouthed withdrawal. They aren’t acknowledging that folk are against sky lanterns for safety reasons, just that folk don’t want the lanterns associated with NHS. They’ll continue to personalise and sell them. Utterly ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SandraJ52547702  https://t.co/mwhURuhJng It’s basically a Government organisation (not party political) linked to DEFRA. It has a wide remit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder @fisermanian At the moment, I’m sharing my Daily Government Walk with non-birding husband who wouldn’t appreciate wandering for hours looking for a LWt. A targeted mission is another matter entirely 🙄😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@haveigotnews He’s raising it for NHS Charities. A bit different.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fisermanian Give us a clue!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 We’ve got Robins feeding chicks in the ivy and I’m out of mealworms. I’ve ordered a bag from Maltbys. Thanks for the nudge. 👍👍🐣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SwaledaleBirds A lot of small businesses sell via both sites. Do those sellers have access to Amazon packaging? I don’t know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SwaledaleBirds Mr Bezos is the mega winner from the Covid Crisis according to the papers. But he’s donated 0.1% of his fortune to helping those in need, so that’s ok.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well done to the Design Faculty at #HarrogateGrammar. 👍👍😷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MyDoncaster Take a look at the third photo. The big carrier bag says Christian Louboutin, ie shoe maker to the wealthy. You’d think a person who could afford to pay hundreds for his shoes could afford a skip. 🙄😩😩😷#Shocking #AntiSocial #Thoughtless<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @WakeyBirders Fly tipping. Quelle surprise. Tip closed for the duration 😷 and not many people about to see you dump your rubbish 😩😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 Aha. You can see what are either Emu or Ostrich from the M1 near Horbury Lagoons 🤔 He’s probably bigger than a cat!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 He’s obviously escaped from someone’s collection/garden. Is there a Horbury Facebook thing you could put him on? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 What you have there is a male Lady Amherst’s Pheasant. Someone will be missing it.....😳🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder Didn’t know this name. Just call it Yellow Dead Nettle here 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonquilLucy @BBCr4today @NHSProviders And then Brexit got in the way and became all-consuming 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wilgils I hope he has had plenty of time to reflect on the #NHS and its true value. I’m pleased that he specifically named the NZ and Portuguese nurses who kept vigil over him. Who knew that we rely on immigrants to help run ‘our NHS’?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was #Pugneys at 11:15 this morning on my Gov approved walk. The quietest Easter Sunday imaginable 😷  https://t.co/nZ4Df1xGOZ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If you’re missing the East Coast, catch up with tonight’s #Countryfile. Brid, and Bempton Gannets. Food for the soul. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SwaledaleBirds @flako1959 Well yes. But if you want an extendable thingy to reach cobwebs then there’s only one place to go. Apart from that, I use it for bird food that isn’t bird seed if you know what I mean. I’d be quite happy if plastic tat stayed in China, never mind reaching our shores and landfill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder There’s posh!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SwaledaleBirds @flako1959 Yes indeed. We were introduced to Yorkshire Trading by our daughter when she was at Durham. A real treasure trove! I get mealworms and bird food nuggets from the ones in Pickering or Malton. Don’t think it would count as an essential drive - are they even open?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SwaledaleBirds @flako1959 Darn Sarf? Wakefield? 😂No, sadly. And I didn’t fancy spending an age in our mega Asda poking around for seeds 😱😷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 I realised I was out of Courgette and Leek seeds last night and went onto the Sutton’s website. To be told that there was a wait for access as 290 people were in the queue before me....😳😳😷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave @CroftonBirder My god. I feel about 100 at the moment with the stress of this bloody plague. 😩😷<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mn_reeder Doing our best. Following instructions 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mn_reeder Good luck to both of you, but especially your Missis. And that pie looks spectacularly good!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Barnsley Road #Wakefield mid-afternoon today. A few cars on the move but I’ve never ever seen it like this. 😷  https://t.co/vWsnJRlNM2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 First Orange Tip here today too. Brimstones since last week. 🦋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First #Swallow of the year for me on the wires at Castle Farm. 👍 #Pugneys @WakeyBirders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fisermanian All CWetlands? So I can target my walk👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959  I’ve ordered one. It’ll probably arrive too late but who’s counting any more?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 I think you’d have to be a certain sort of person to engage in that sort of destruction. It would break my heart. #HS2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillAspin 😱😱😂😂Masterclass! I’d have done exactly the same 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brilliant 👍😱😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Deep joy. Our garden visitors are back, bolder than ever. Only to discover our tadpoles are self-isolating after last year’s pond trashing. Mrs Mallard has discovered an ornamental pond further down the garden so we’re all happy 🙄😂  https://t.co/EQYjDnR6Cn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 It’s our daughter’s birthday on Wed but she’s working from home on her own. It’ll be a FaceTime call from us and a zoom drinks party with friends I think. Hoping for a joint birthday proper get-together in mid-July for her and her Dad. She’s dealing with it better than me 😷😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCr4today Maybe they should also consider why some massive cheap n cheerful clothes warehouses are working full tilt? Are they really essential key industries? Some worrying statements from their staff re social distancing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@borobarrister Google “tree pollen video” and take your pick 😱😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave It’s driving us potty (very loud and unmusical) and the object of its attentions is utterly unimpressed;  just looks at it witheringly, if Magpies can do such a thing. 🙄😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@fisermanian 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any explanation? We have a Magpie calling incessantly for last few days, perched with wings flapping. Doesn’t appear to be a youngster - and too early surely? Lots of Magpies close by- counted 18 in one field yesterday.🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fisermanian Give us a clue, Ian? Pugneys or Wetlands?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley Right. So that bloody enormous Great Dane that nearly took me out this teatime on my quiet walk would be a good start 😱😷😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley Yes but what does one put on one’s Apocalist?  Is it like Room101 or the opposite? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley Right. Can you please explain to a old person what an #Apocalist is. Please. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillAspin The change of scenery is probably worth a pair of Smew in today’s world 😷🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StansaidAirport Indeed. I won’t name the hotel, but it was serious “throughput” territory. The “dining room” (ha!) was worse than any school canteen and the (alleged) sausages live in my memory as being an alien food product.  And it was heavingly busy, most people staying one night I think 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StansaidAirport And what about #Britannia hotel group? I’ve stayed in several very nice Best Westerns, both here and abroad, but the Britannia near Russell Square was a serious mistake. The worst hotel ever, booked through a Theatre break. 😩😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SoVeryBritish It would be interesting to analyse the results by age. The older generation were brought up on #saladcream as kids; mayonnaise was unheard of. It was a prerequisite for Saturday teatime in our house. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KitchenBee @iowtomatoes @eatlikeagirl After WW2, Mum moved to deepest Rutland with Dad’s job. She used to send (by train) boxes of tomatoes, given to her by neighbours, to her Mum in Newcastle, where they were virtually impossible to buy. 🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@flako1959 I’ve retweeted it 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 How many of these arrivals are returning Brits who will go straight into Lockdown? How many hop onto the tube or into a taxi? Number of NY arrivals particularly worrying.

<|startoftext|>@YCNature @DarrenNWoodhead This really needs producing as a print, Darren. It’s so unusual to see a range of garden birds all on one picture. Unless it’s on a jigsaw! 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Markthebirder I’m just hoping that there’s a few Puffins left at #Bempton by the time ‘this’ is over sufficiently for us to leave our neighbourhood. I was made up to see Sandmartins and a Blackcap this morning. It’s all relative. 😳😷<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FakeHeadteacher I taught for years and years before WALT and WILF were anything more than 2 blokes’ names. A quick intro at the start of the lesson and we were off.

<|startoftext|>@J_S_Snowden Sounds like scary stuff. However, I’m sure groups like yours do nothing before all safety measures are in place. The world needs people like you, Joe!

<|startoftext|>@J_S_Snowden I saw it and thought of you! I don’t understand any of your academic tweets, but they all sound amazing work. Are you involved in the Covid vaccine chase? Look after yourself. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 I have several clumps of these but have to keep a strict eye out for the dreaded scarlet Lily Beetle which chomp through the stalks in no time.

<|startoftext|>@flako1959 Sainsbury’s Ings Road Wakey. One in, one out. Collect your own trolley and clean the handle yourself if you have brought some hand san. None apparent.

<|startoftext|>@s_davis188 @flako1959 Scuse me! I’m old and I leap aside for cyclists and joggers/runners who seem to want to maintain a straight line regardless. And as for that bloody stupid woman with the out-of-control wet spaniel who had NO concept of personal space... and neither did the sodding dog .......😬😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 Been for our afternoon walk. We ‘danced around’ a couple of older ladies and so discussed with them, at a distance, whether the rule should be ‘walk on the left’ as a car drives, or ‘walk on the right facing the oncoming traffic’. I think this needs a National Regulation. 🤔🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bocephus7 @Peston @Jack_Blanchard_ We passed York Designer Outlet on Sunday, just before “lockdown” The car park was very busy. And no, they really don’t sell essentials. Loads of cars on our main road still; can’t believe they are all on essential business.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peston @rob_yaxley @Jack_Blanchard_ On my walk yesterday: Group of 5 lads out walking. 3 young men standing shoulder to shoulder discussing a road-mending job. 4/5 unloading building materials from a van, side by side. The hi-viz jackets obviously protecting the latter 2 groups. As if it isn’t happening. 😳😩🥱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@borobarrister 😂😂 Rather like me and my compulsive potting up of seedlings found in the garden and cuttings. Have decided to put a load at the end of the drive for people to take. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@borobarrister What are you planning to do with them all? Are they in waiting for the mass tree planting initiative when “it’s all over”?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 @WakeyBirders Thank you. There used to be a small flock of them in the local park when I was a kid. They used to chase us - terrifying when you’re little!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WYP_RPU @wakeyweir86 To be fair, this is our local walk as we live 5 minutes walk away. There were very few people walking/running/walking a dog yest aft and all very sensibly distanced. It seemed very quiet indeed and not at all threatening.  The van’s not helping though. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @WakeyBirders I’ll tell you when somebody tells me what it is! I suspect it’s an escaped ‘foreigner’ 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @WakeyBirders No. We went mid aft, walked from our house, via Pugneys, to far end of CW &amp; home. 5 miles. There were max 12 people doing the CW circuit so all very distant. Saw a pair of RPlover on the quiet building site ‘pool’, from the banking. CW quieter than Pugneys by far, tho P not busy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomnorris70_3 And don’t forget to give your Mum a call occasionally 😊😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYPRuralTF If it’s not acceptable to go for a walk in a group of 3, it can’t be acceptable for this to be happening in a National Lockdown especially in warm, dry, windy weather. Can you do anything? Utter disregard for the possible need for emergency services.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This 👇🏻on #CalderWetlands yesterday afternoon. I can’t remember the name. Advice please? ⁦@WakeyBirders⁩  https://t.co/7sQIC0Iknf<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Howardian_Hills We had a phone call to our landline yesterday, from a voice informing OH that his National Insurance Number had been compromised and they needed personal details to sort it out. 🙄Phone straight down. #ScamAware<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bucktonbirder Yes. That’s why we don’t have one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lophophanes @HugojWilson @Recordshotmyars @SIBirdClub Yes but bird seed would cause havoc with the keyboard 😳😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Here’s a question. Pair of Lapwing appear to be starting to nest in field by our house. What to do? Farmer has sprayed 3 times in 3 weeks. Worried nest will get squashed next visit. Any advice? 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @YoloBirder Right. There’s a challenge as long as the printer’s working....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @YoloBirder Now there’s a woman over familiar with Excel spreadsheets. Mine tomorrow will be a paper and pencil affair I’m afraid 😂🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wilgils I didn’t sleep much last night, Jan. Don’t think I’ll sleep much tonight either. I’ll still be up reading at 2am to silence my worries. ☹️🥱Difficult times. Look after yourself 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder @MagnusC16 Bedroom window birding it is then! 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 Any use?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MagnusC16 @YoloBirder Right. So they don’t have to be landed in the garden then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somebody needs to add some humour to this crappy situation. 😩😂#lockdownuk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justin_ng @McDonaldsUK Gloves give a false sense of security. They handle contaminated material with gloved hands and move on to the next customer. With contaminated gloves. No different to bare hands UNLESS the gloves are changed after every transaction. Which they won’t be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Threaten to come and stand right next to them if they start. 😳😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning We think we have Robins nesting in the ivy on the garage. Good job I didn’t clear it earlier in the year as I’d intended 🤔👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MindthegapMum @HalilMrT1 @DavidN_Cahn Open windows wherever possible. A draught through is better. Prevents fuggy, damp conditions which are a breeding ground for all sorts.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NYMMonitors Watching #Countryfile at #RSPB reserve near Lake Vyrnwy. There are farmers with tractors CUTTING heather to various lengths. Not burning it. So it can be done. Do we know any reason why this isn’t done on the NY Moors? Asking you rather than CA as you’ll make sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning I had the opposite- I managed to have a conversation with a chap about the whereabouts of a Pintail. He was on one side of the top fence, me on the other. Very effective! #StAidans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 If I come across any, I’ll let you know. Dried or fresh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder We’re doing a practice run. Will finalise Marton Mipits tonight ready for tomorrow 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 I’ll keep my eyes open for ideas 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder Right, my thick questions. You can only score once for a bird; am I right? So if our GSW appears 4 times on the nuts, it only counts once. And if there’s 5 Starlings, it’s Starling + another, not 5 x Starling. Just checking! 🤔😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jgsigsworth I think that magic money pot has already been emptied by Rishi yesterday. #priorities<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1  Could you pass this on to Liz S please? Might be of use. 🤔👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watch this 20 times and laugh out loud. You know you want to 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 Thought about that yesterday as OH was filling the car. You hold the pump handle for a good 2 mins. I splurged his hands with hand san when he finished and before he got back into the car, him being old! Older lady pump opposite was wearing gloves. 🤔👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HanbyAndrew @vismigKC They say there’s no such thing as Bad Publicity. I hope this is the exception.  Hats off to the locals who have rescued, with both accommodation and jobs, the evicted workers. #BritanniaHotels<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYMMonitors @Markthebirder @northyorkmoors Can’t locate precisely. Drove up through C Howard to Slingsby a couple of hours ago. Three burns ongoing on the moorland beyond, all considerable, with smoke drifting for miles. 😩😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simon_reeve Just wait until Boris tells us the Police will nail our front doors shut and run around catching people in an oversized fishing net, both seen on the News. And leave children to die, trapped in a flat with a dead relative. That’ll go down well. #China<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 What about Fiona the Flamingo, if I remember correctly?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 @HolkhamEstate #YorkshireArboretum is free for the duration to allow people to walk and exercise while keeping their distance. Holkham beach is fantastic, but that’s quite a parking fee!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NatalieNeill29 @BritanniaLtd It’s a big hotel chain. Britannia hotels. They seem to be independent looking hotels, but they’re not. The worst hotel I’ve ever stayed in (in London as part of a theatre break, random hotel) was a Britannia. They have ‘throughputs’ not customers or guests. I’m not surprised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 A Britannia group hotel, Sarah. The worst hotel I ever stayed in, in the U.K. was a Britannia in London. Never again. Not surprised by this at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder 🙄😩Right. I’ll replace it with A SPADE and see what happens 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder Perched on a shepherd’s crook shaped light hanger thing. Does that count?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Barnsleybsg On stretch of road running up the side of OldMoor mid afternoon, a very large raptor dead in the centre of road, on its back. Looked horribly like a Marsh Harrier but impossible to be certain. Apparently just happened as bird was undamaged, so to speak. A sorry sight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder Do we have to participate every day and is there a time limit per day? And OH says, how many points for a Robin perching artistically on a garden light, then hopping off to collect nesting material and disappearing with it into the ivy on the garage wall? Repeatedly. 🤔😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave @KevinGroocock We drove home from Barnsley this aft and passed a bloke wandering out of a Spar type shop with ....... a pack of 16 (16!!) loo rolls. I did briefly contemplate opening the car window and grabbing them..... then wondered why manufacturers are still producing 16-roll-packs 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jo_birding @FlamboroughBird Can you just post another picture of a Sunday trifle for us to drool (remotely, at a distance) over, please?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hudsonweather @BBCLookNorth @looknorthBBC But, and I’m sure the answer is ,”Of course!”, do they still fit? 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisGPackham @_BTO Trust you’re doing @YoloBirder ‘S equivalent of Fantasy Football but with Garden Birds 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder I’m sorry. A Woodpig is not worth 50p, never mind £5,000,000. 🙄🙄 Never having done FFootball, I’m thinking these rules need studying. I’m sure OH will explain.... 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hudsonweather @BBCLookNorth @looknorthBBC Bring out all those colourful jackets you used to wear. We need a bit (lot) of cheer. If they’re not still in the wardrobe, you could arrange to borrow Michael Portillo’s 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@haywood_russ Old Moor and Blacktoft both closed fully. St Aidan’s and Fairburn both open with free parking, but VC closed. Full list online.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave Rather like, when Trump appears on TV to pontificate, there’s always a row of random people squeezed in, shoulder to shoulder, behind him - for no apparent purpose. Giving the wrong message entirely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RSPB_OldMoor Adwick it is, then. Or Wombwell Ings, or Edderthorpe.... Thank goodness St Aidan’s and Fairburn are open.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SboroGottLad Good luck to you, Michael. Trust things work out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lardlikesdogs @sainsburys The Ings Road store always seems short staffed.  They really do need all hands on the proverbial to get the shelves stacked, and prioritise too. I know chocolate is important, but I’d rather someone was filling tinned goods instead. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lardlikesdogs @sainsburys They need to. I went into my local Sainsbury’s on Monday. Tinned food shelves were bare but there was a massive pallet - 6 feet high - full of packs of tins to be unpacked and put on shelves. And ONE very harassed and defeated looking lady wondering where on Earth to start.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Natures_Voice Morning! How about setting up a daily Big Garden Watch? Millions would take part as it’d pass an hour every day for the next 12 weeks! Only partly kidding 😱😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@flako1959 I’ve had an idea for a TV cookery show, on the lines of Ready, Steady, Cook. The chefs go to Sainsbury’s in Wakey and have 10 minutes to find enough ingredients to make a 3 course meal for 4. No ready meals allowed. That’ll tax their ingenuity 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BBCr4today Oh just use your Common Sense. Going for a walk is a good idea and is necessary for lots of older people. Find somewhere open and quiet and don’t stop to talk to people. Open air, breezy day, sunshine. Far better than sitting in 24/24. Mental wellbeing is as important as physical<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sturdyAlex I’m hoping that at the very least, the virus gives Boris a hefty dose of reality and the true meaning of responsibility. He’s probably thinking, “This isn’t the Premiership I was voted in for”. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WfldPeregrines @UoLperegrine Noooo! Pigeons please! We have very few Yellowhammer around Wakey. There’s hundreds of Woodpigs in the fields behind our house.  Sigh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally managed to confirm our mystery Mallow Tit (Marsh or Willow) is in fact a pair(🤗🤗) of #MarshTit.  Calling in the garden as I was pruning the Buddleia next to the bird feeder. #Marton #NYorks  Constantly feeding 👍so food obviously more important than my presence.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Can a younger person out there please tell me when the word ‘very’ was replaced with ‘super’? As in, this is a super tasty recipe. Or she’s super clever.  It irritates me in the same way as when I hear, “ Can I get a ...” in a bar/cafe/restaurant. Sorry. I’m old. 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrMichaelSpicer Next time you mention the MP Laura Trott, can you please add in brackets (No, not THAT Laura Trott,the lovely Olympic cyclist) please, as she’s not always referred to as Laura Kenny. Or we still think of her as Laura Trott 🤔😱<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 What time is kick off this evening please? #MacmillanDinner<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Rather like the folk on here who seem to think that dredging will sort every flooding problem every time. It’s a trifle more nuanced than that, I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning That’s the Wakey Express for you. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnLawArt @Wentworth_House The house is no longer in private hands and is run by a charitable trust. I understand that the renovations are being overseen by the National Trust. The Trust was awarded£7 million by the Gov in 2018 but much more needed. It is a amazingly beautiful building.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 If you’re not up to the challenge, and I know what flu does, do feel free to postpone till you’re better.  And don’t forget to “pass it on”. The challenge, not the flu! 😱<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JonathanBliss @chapiteaumt @UoLperegrine @marybeth_w86 @leedsbirder Nooo - that’s what pigeons are for!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bucktonbirder I assume these are the #RedKites in Wales at the site where the chap has been feeding them for years? Unsure where exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Did you see the pics I retweeted of the canal lock near Horbury Bridge? Frightening damage there. Caused by an overflowing rush of river floodwater from the Calder, at a bend, and smashing its way into the nearby canal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Well the second picture- I could cry. Good luck to the eventual  building. It’d better have bloody good drains. Have we learned NOTHING about building on or next to a flood plain? #PeelEstates.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley Address as before? It’s quite sharp if that’s ok 🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dannyfardell1 @simmonite_dave Entirely up to you. I’m treating it as things that mean something to me now. Or something I see or do regularly. Nothing spectacular required. The difficult thing is the No People!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the lock at the bottom end of Healey Road, Ossett, after the recent flooding on the Calder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 Absolutely shocking, Sarah. We had no idea this had happened 😱😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning No people! 😊<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @WakeyBirders Even better in close up! I can’t recall seeing a Stonechat so close to the farm before. They tend to be over at Calder Wetlands 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@susie_dent My OH used to work for a chap who used to say, ‘I hope you’re ficient. Cos I hates people who are unficient.’  It took him a while to persuade him that the words were efficient and inefficient.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@YorkshireTea Just continue being #YorkshireTea and a #NationalTreasure. I was waiting for a hotel lift t’other day &amp; a chap also waiting had a stack of boxes of your tea which, it turns out, he was taking back home to Switzerland cos it’s his favourite. Told him he had excellent taste 👍👍🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @RHSHarlowCarr Going to Harrogate (snow dependant) on Wednesday. I’ll have to call in at HC and go up to the bird hide. A reliable place for Nuthatch and Marsh Tit in the past. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeWParker Rather like I the KevinCostner Robin Hood film, where he landed near Dover, galloped past Hadrians Wall in Northumberland, and ended up at Aysgarth in the Yorkshire Dales, which was posing as Sherwood Forest #geography #pedant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yorkshirepost We have a small cottage that is all-electric (no gas in village) with electric wall heaters, but with a log burner. Power cuts are regular, either planned or unplanned. In winter, the log burner is a God send when this happens. We burn seasoned wood, however, a better choice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@damian_money We live 300 yards from a floodplain (Up a bit of a hill 😳) and watch the beck feeding the Calder flood every year, this year more so than we can remember in 30+ years.  We mess with floodplains at our own risk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmyJaneBeer @damian_money @johnredwood But you can’t argue against his saying not building on flood plains. That really needs enforcing and should be his number one point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave I’ll have a look. Hadn’t thought of online. 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave That sounds like a good haul!! Where do you source your seed? I get mine from Bata as if I buy a particular one, there’s a loyalty card with a sack free after 10. A cheeper option might help though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave You need to set up a Crowdfunding page to pay for the bird seed for that lot!! 😱 What are they in the main? Difficult to see individuals 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@archignat @flako1959 @CityofYork Some folk need to have things spelled out very clearly. “Oh, 60+ refers to age and not the number of trips I do a week?” someone will ask. It’s like getting on to a bus marked Leeds and asking if the bus goes to Leeds 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 @CityofYork All part of the huge disparity between spending on TfL and the rest of the country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whiterosegreen @jeanthorpeRR @LDV_NNR The flooding between Tadcaster and the A64 and surrounding area is spectacular too. No doubt someone will be applying to build on it shortly 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCMarkEaston Thank you for your piece on the #PrincesTrust work with underachieving school leavers. It’s a change to watch such a positive and inspirational article on the News. So pleased that the young lady whom you interviewed got her job. 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bucktonbirder Rogers of Pickering would put you on the right track.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder Yes, but how’s the skiing going? 😱😱😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LegoLostAtSea You can find shops using them to hold large fruit and also big Spanish onions. Sadly, quite common in supermarkets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley The mega lake between the brewery at Tadcaster and the A64 is spectacular. Sadly, nobody will be playing football on the sports field for a while 😳#flooding<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trawler1x1 @borobarrister There are several very tame ones in Regents Park in London. They’ll stand in your path and only shuffle off when you’re almost on top of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveCJjones This has now been noted and acted upon. What a pity nobody did a survey before doing what they obviously thought was the Right Thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WaterVole I sincerely hope that the saplings have not been ‘ripped up’. Surely someone can replant them in a more sensible place?  Or is this just lazy journalism?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willowbeachbum @imranahmadkhan No. There were problems with the disposal of the dredged material, but not with actual dredging from what I have read.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnLawArt Thanks John. I have no excuse now for not finding the place!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The additional offerings BTL are also wondrously amusing. 🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder We saw several Black Kites around Lake Lucerne and Nutcracker on a walk from Zermatt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder Black Kites and Nutcracker tomorrow 🤞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StonesGary @AlexGlendinning Local knowledge! Always useful. Thanks again, Gary. Can I just say this is where Twitter is brilliant. There are lots of kind, helpful and lovely people out there.  Pity everyone isn’t in that category. The world would be a much better place if they were. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning No wonder you couldn’t find it then! No excuse now. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StonesGary @AlexGlendinning Thanks Gary. I thought it was just past OM when I went looking for it and ended up half way along the main road, round numerous little roundabouts. Then I turned off, found the golf place and assumed I was v wrong so gave up. Wonderful what a little info does!! 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Have you picked up answers to me?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeithSaunders9 @Barnsleybsg Thank you Keith. On my To Do list now. I might even find the #Scaup 😳😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nico1ame @Barnsleybsg Thanks very much Nicola. The map helps. Difficult to drive and ‘spot’ safely when you don’t know the area.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nico1ame @Barnsleybsg Hmm. Not even sure where the visitors’ centre bit is 😳 I found a golf place last week but assumed I was wrong at that point!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Barnsleybsg Advice please. Where is the best place to park for Manvers Lake? I drove back from Adwick to Old Moor last week and couldn’t see anywhere safe to park. Am I ‘barking up the wrong tree?’ Or just being dozy. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What lies beneath: the nature park covering up a dirty secret  https://t.co/bVRUAKYtKZ A good news story for a change. Worth the read. 👍👍🐝🦉🐞🐍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Recordshotmyars Looks more like a plastic bag to me. Not a clue. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lardlikesdogs @leedsbirder @LeedsCC_News You might be surprised. I can’t remember which prog it was last year, but there was a small WVole population living in a ‘drain’ alongside an A road down south. Shocking. Full of rubbish etc but they were hanging on. Just wanted to scoop them up and move them somewhere clean.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leedsbirder Interesting to read the long list of places for which Leeds CC are responsible. Quite a mixed bag! I’ll fill it in as a visitor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealOenas @Duncbye Thank you to you, Oenas. It’s a massive area to get to know. Rather wet at the moment I imagine 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Duncbye @RealOenas Thanks Duncan. That’s very helpful 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Duncbye Duncan - where is the best place to park up for North Duffield Carrs? It’s an area I’m just getting to know. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @WakeyBirders Nor me. It’s not an easy walk in places due to the mud, but nowhere near as bad as Johnny Brown’s!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Pugneys Water level on main lake has dropped. Path btw lake &amp; playing field passable in wellies if you use the metal (contractors) path. Very muddy. Fields very flooded. Castle pond now renamed “Castle Inland Sea”. Farm bridge not advisable! ⁦@WakeyBirders⁩  https://t.co/sGsvN6RVmX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley Hope you manage to get it cleared. Just off th inspect the flooding here - it’s flood plain so not a problem. Just a LOT of extra water.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley So is that the insurers off the hook? Surely not!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley Out of interest, whose responsibility is it to move the tree out of the way? Mammoth job 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rawmarsh_Nature Where best to park for Manvers Lake please?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning There’s always Red Kites over the Showground on the way in to Harrogate. They float in quite low - when I went on a day out to the showground for a countryside day with Year 3-6s, they were fascinated by them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 Having lunch after the #VanGogh exhibition. Quite remarkable and the VR add on was certainly worth the extra £3. Thanks for the tip! Waters have receded a bit, but no doubt Storm Dennis will remedy that 😱😱💦💦 #York<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomnorris70_3 Though you might prefer for Joe to cook for you ?🤔😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomnorris70_3 If you want a home cooked meal next visit, give us a ring.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarristerSecret I’ve gone back through the previous incumbents of this post for the last 30 years. All are/were QCs. There are many ‘big names’ who have held the post. Are we in the position that not one of the current bunch of Tory MPs are also QCs? Are we really at barrel-scraping by PM Dom?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Baltzersens Well, about time too! Our favourite cafe in Harrogate is opening a bakery. Supporting independents is so important. Looking forward to more news 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Johnnyredtales @StansaidAirport Now you may scoff. We’ve booked a Ryanair for a flight in September because they’re the ONLY airline flying to Genoa from North of the M25. And to make matters worse, we’re flying from Stansted. We’re nice, middle class people. I promise we won’t climb on to the bag drop, honest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarristerSecret A not-insignificant %age of the population don’t think that people charged with certain crimes warrant a defence team.  These are the folk who will agree with the “meddling judges” trope. The independence of our judiciary needs loud support for all to hear and understand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 Pass 30?? I can’t even remember being 30 😳😳😂 #BlockAndTackleRequired<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And three more #Wainwrights tops to ID if anyone out there can help. Please RT #LakeDistrict  https://t.co/ci9FNFK2AU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Husband  completed the #Wainwrights last year and is organising his photos. However, he can’t ID these tops. Can anyone out there assist? #LakeDistrict  https://t.co/0W0KIfSXrg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 @107Richard @imranahmadkhan Just not good enough, Sarah. The Council, I mean, not you!! Known flood risk location pumps should be monitored regularly. It’s not the proverbial rocket science 🙄😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 @107Richard @imranahmadkhan “But not yet”. Very reassuring indeed. Should be a priority.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 We have tickets for the York Van Gogh “exhibition” on Friday. We’ll bring wellies 😳😳💦#NormalForYork<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shetlandnature @Recordshotmyars @NatureInShet @RareBirdAlertUK @BirdGuides @dunnjons @PromoteShetland @Shetnews @shetlandtimes The only time I’ve come across the word ‘peerie’ is in the Ann Cleeves Shetland novels. I had to go and look it up. It’s a lovely little word 😊😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Recordshotmyars We do indeed. We also love Kestrels 😊 But how nice that those correcting the OP did so politely and in a helpful manner, not aggressively or patronisingly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Pugneys sit. rep.  Main lake footpath breached at “dog beach” hence boat afloat 😳 &amp; playing field underwater. Path from farm buildings to bridge flooded. Wellies essential.  Floodplain doing its thing 👍👍⁦@WakeyBirders⁩  https://t.co/zvxbwutjJC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StansaidAirport I looked it up. If you go back to the origins of the word, it involved death too, to the mis-pronouncers. Ephraimites and Gileadites, 1370 BCE. Plus ça change and all that. Can we go back to the usual stuff now please? 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StormchaserUKEU @ColeraineMeteo If it was that bad at Brum, goodness only knows what Leeds Bradford was like. 😱😱🛫🛬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StansaidAirport A shibboleth if I’m not mistaken?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley 🙄 That’s where an elderly Defender wins every time. Up and over the banking, across the field, round the tree. No probs 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MiddleAgedCred @StansaidAirport And as my Dad used to say to my Mum, “Howay man, woman!”  No, me neither.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 Stay in. It’s not nice out there. Our garden is steadily flooding (lower than house) but it’s blowing a hoolie. So stay in. Unless you’re out of ale, that is 😱😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wintersett1 Aha. Been going in completely the wrong direction 🙄🙄 I’ll try again later this morning. Maybe third time lucky! Many thanks. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wintersett1 Do I park at Anglers or somewhere on the road? Haven’t found the Dam wall yet 🙄Got bogged down in muddy field nr boats first time then parked nr fishing sign yest and walked. Am I close? Think not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wintersett1 Dipped the LTD again yesterday 🙄though the bitter wind made standing around difficult. Any pointers please for best area to look? Very unsure of the res and its paths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StansaidAirport Right. Got that. But equally worried about personal safety while at your airport. Cows on planes, personnel being sliced by helicopter blades, ATC asleep at their radar, Gary forever running out of de-icer, over-enthusiastic searches at security .... hardly reassuring 😱😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StansaidAirport Right. A little worried. We’ve booked a few days away to Italy later in the year, and the only available flight is 1) Ryanair from 2) Stansted. On a scale of 1 to 10, how worried should we actually be?? 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 We watched 4 SEOs at RSPB St Aidan’s the other week from the path, with brilliant views. Several toggers but nobody out of order. It is possible! But some folk have to push boundaries. 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 For the sake of the birds, no, if this is what some folk get up to. They don’t deserve the photo opportunity if they can’t keep a respectable and respectful distance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Not good about the swan 😱I’ve only ever been ‘responsible’ for the death of one bird. I was in my car waiting at the lights on Barnsley Road and a Woodpigeon flew smack into the passenger window. Neck broken. Instant gonner. It wasn’t an experience I’d want to repeat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave Well yes.  Rather messy in the evening, but miraculously tidy by morning 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave When I was a kid, I lived next door to the sister of Elizabeth Beresford, who wrote the Wombles. Not many people know that 🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 😂😂👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 But not much from a Hungry Caterpillar 😩This could get silly 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 Peter Rabbit casserole. Maybe not. 😱🐰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s so reassuring to know that the country is in such safe and knowledgeable hands. I am aware that hands probably can’t be knowledgeable.  It’s a metaphor. I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @WakeyBirders We’ve had one over the garden twice today, and there was one in the top of the tree opposite the daughter’s house in Chapel A yesterday. #Sparrowhawk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder @WfldPeregrines @Fhickenbottom @Bucktonbirder I read it as a Penguin falcon before finding my reading glasses 🙄😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bucktonbirder Well they’ll keep you busy on your next train journey. Calculators not allowed, I assume? Look pretty standard to me, and far less complex than that Mr Turtle’s holiday conundrum 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StansaidAirport Or understands 🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sajidjavid @DominicRaab @trussliz Very environmentally on-message with the plastic water bottles and plastic “glasses”, and the non-reusable coffee/tea cups.

<|startoftext|>2 Little Egrets in field between Monks Cross York shopping centre and A64 roundabout.  #CommonAsMuck 😳😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ByDonkeys Thank you for all you’ve done. This one reduced me to tears, especially the final sentiment 🇪🇺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bucktonbirder @susanlilly Come on Mark. In the U.K., everything is compared, size-wise, either to Wales or to an Olympic Swimming Pool. Or a tennis court. You know this!!.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder And whatever we manage/fail to do to avert climate change, the planet will go on with, or eventually, without us. We may well be a mere blip in its existence 🌍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LegoLostAtSea You could open a museum with the amount you collect. When I walk Whitby beach with its big waves, there’s rarely any debris to speak of. The currents are obviously wrong. (Or right as stuff is dumped elsewhere 😩😩)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LegoLostAtSea I enjoy (!) looking at your beautifully arranged compositions, despite the provenance of the material. But the question is, what DO you do with the thousands of items you “collect”?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bruce_bwkm So your fridge can talk to your driverless car. Apparently. Though why it might want to is anyone’s guess. #5G<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrMichaelSpicer Our phone box has books AND a defibrillator 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 @Beakmoo There was the bloke on the telly who told Farage we’d be fine as we could go back to being the British Empire and trade with them, no problem, all sorted, easy. And no doubt he voted. Frightening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 @Beakmoo Just wondering if that’s the well-known British Kylie who’s providing the music, opposed to the little-known Aussie? 🤔😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 When would you like the cash? Silly question 🙄😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 Afternoon Sarah. Could the Milburns and Parsons please book a table for 4 for the Macmillan dinner? 😃🍷🍽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RSPB_OldMoor I’m afraid I really didn’t enjoy my visit this afternoon. Negotiating the mud in the car park was awful and there’s so much going on near the VC end that it was like birding on a building site. I’ll see you in a month’s time, I think. 😞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrationHarry @Hudsonweather @KeeleyDonovan Did you get dressed in the dark?? Owaine would’ve had 40 fits had he seen you in this ensemble. 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WildlifeInWakey That’s the one I meant - opposite Sainsbury’s. The Blackbirds ( we had 14 at one point) cleared next door’s big Rowan tree in October 🙄😩So no chance of anything interesting now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wintersett1 @StevieD131 @Fitzybirder @grayspeight @CroftonBirder @BeckyBailey101 @Barnsleybsg @BirdGuides Any sign of the LTD please?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WildlifeInWakey Yes, they hung around Sainsbury’s for quite a while last year. The big tree doesn’t look too promising however - very few red berries, sadly. Still, other trees available!! 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@passportwaiting Sent online application for husband’s Renewal passport a week ago. The new one arrived this morning. Excellent service. Thank you. 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder That’s far too sensible, Chris. It really isn’t a Party Political matter, rather, really, like transport, the NHS and the environment. Stuff that’s too important to be fought over as point-scoring, and in need of more than short-term planning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CraigCThomas1 Have made first contact with Wilddog. I’ll let you know how we get on! 🤔#Namibia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomnorris70_3 You need a 10 year old. They babble on about it all the time 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 Daughter’s friend set up a wormery in her Leeds office for food scraps. They sell the resulting “worm tea” fertiliser to staff for charity 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 Does school have a wormery or a compost heap for left over scraps and peelings?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning May later have damp trouble. Area prone to flooding.  No matter, Peel Estates will build anywhere 😩😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@invisiblehand11 @Dannythefink My late Mum was in the WAAF in Communications. After her death we found her photo album from various placing. We know she’d been sent to Belgium &amp; Germany as the war ended, but her final photo was captioned ‘On the way to Bergen Belsen’. We know no more. She never spoke of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 But you’d still prefer the peace and quiet! Me too really. Sod’s Law it was Brambling they were interrupting. I hope you gave a Master Class in Bird ID 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 @Natures_Voice @bolton_abbey Ask yourself which is more important. You’ve seen Bramblings before and probably don’t need another photo of them 🙄The kids, OTOH, need all the encouragement they can get. Suck it up, as they say 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirdwatchExtra Then it’s done rather more than “decimate” a colony, as decimate means to remove one in every 10. That’s me being a #pedant. Sorry. Sounds like the feral cat needs re-homing 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Before Christmas we had 14 (fourteen!) Blackbirds in the garden. Great seeing so many. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Recordshotmyars @BirdGuides @RareBirdAlertUK Apparently, mis-photo aside, the Sea Eagle in question is one of 6 youngsters released recently on the IoW. 2 have been clocked over London and one has been seen regularly with some Red Kites, feeding on carrion. It obviously self-identifies now as a Red Kite. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder @MattTheHairy Right. Away you go. Nothing to stop you now 😂😂😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder I was imagining a researcher from The One Show saying, “Now let me get this right. You’ll appear on the programme to promote the book, but only if you can be dressed in a gorilla costume?”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RSPBNews @Red67book @Mark_A_Eaton And not one mention in the article of the involvement of the serially anonymous Mr Yolo Birder. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuffolkGazette Isn’t he married to Lorraine Fisher aged 34?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well done ⁦@asda⁩ for this idea. Growing herbs sold in a brown paper bag, as a “plug plant” ie with no plastic pot. Remove from bag, pop into a glass or a beaker. Water and use. Take note ⁦@waitrose⁩ ⁦@tesconews⁩ ⁦@sainsburys⁩ ⁦@MorrisonsNews⁩  https://t.co/uPQgKcSerx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZacGoldsmith So much for voluntary restraint. This on Sunday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYMMonitors @damian_money @northyorkmoors @ScarboroCouncil It was bad this Sunday. We counted at least 8 separate fires and the smoke plumes were vast. From a car, you’re not directly affected, but I wouldn’t have wanted to be out walking anywhere near the direction of smoke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning I assume the Ring-necked is the one from Johnny Brown’s pond? The BN Grebe was ridiculously close to the path so really good views 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johndews12_john Thanks.  I realised as I left the car park and drove back that way, that this would’ve been a better route. I’ll know for next time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Black-necked Grebe and Ring-neck Duck both very visible at #Anglers this afternoon. So I thought I’d walk round the field edge to the Res in search of the LTD.  😱😱The mud was beyond unbelievable- I nearly lost me Christmas-present wellies. Suffice to say, I couldn’t find it. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevieD131 @Wintersett1 @CroftonBirder @Fitzybirder @grayspeight @BeckyBailey101 @Barnsleybsg @BirdGuides @bigpaddymartin Think I’d better get myself across. A bit quiet here at #Pugneys 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MalleyAndrew We drove from the A174 to Hutton via Castleton at 4pm. The fires were still actively burning in all directions. The smoke plumes stretched for miles. How is this still allowed? Massive air pollution never mind what’s happening on the ground. 😩😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Northern end of the North York’s Moors today. At least 8 fires creating massive smoke palls blowing across to the coast. I’m sure the Grouse will be pleased. #madness  https://t.co/Fct6PPUjLI<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder You’re most welcome. A little ray of sunshine in a rather depressing environmental world. Thank goodness for the good guys. 🦉🦆🐥🦋🕷🦎🐝🐞😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder Too late! she cried. However, the book and badges are on my list. Well done, young man. You should be very proud of yourself indeed. It’s not just a case of having a bright idea; it needs a determination to make it a reality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArjunDutta228<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArjunDutta228 May I suggest that they add @LegoLostAtSea to their Twitter account. They might then have a startling insight into the longevity of plastics and what happens when they reach the sea. Then fish and birds eat the plastic. And that’s not good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SebDance Thank you for your work. And the last thing we need is the Big Ben Bongs malarkey. It won’t bring us #Remainers into the Leave fold. That’s half the electorate who don’t want it 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Natures_Voice Can somebody please ask the Secretaryof State for the Environment what has happened to the Deposit Scheme for plastic bottles? Since Gove moved on, it appears to have died a death, sadly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CrimeLineLaw @BarristerSecret The Romans referred to it as Bread and Circuses, I believe. We call it keeping Daily Mail readers onside. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirdingClimate @martinRSPB I suspect that having children is even bigger. Population globally when I was born was 2.2 billion. Now 7.7 billion. But that gets barely a mention.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrmarksteel If you’re in West Yorkshire, I can offer 2.  Also a brilliant plumber. If you’re elsewhere, can’t help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LegoLostAtSea This is where @Twitter really needs an OMG button. 😳 or 😬or 😡 or 😟or 😩or 😱. Any of those will do, but you can’t “like” plastic pollution on that scale. No chance of beach cleaning zillions of nurdles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 We called in at Ellerton on the way home. Wind was already up and I could barely see any duck due to the choppy water 🙄😬 Anyway, we now know where it is and will call back next time, assuming Storm Brendon has passed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder Beggars belief, Yolo. Just when you think you’ve seen everything to do with ‘hunting’, something else appears. Maybe the phrase ‘Clay Pigeon Shooting’ got lost in translation, but I doubt it. I assume they’re cheaper than clays 😩😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LDV_NNR @Duncbye @YorkBirding Any idea of the current whereabouts of the 2 Bewicks?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jennyeclair I’d put that on my wall. Like your style 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder Oh, and a Nutcracker on a walk near Zermatt. I’ll dig out my records.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder Well we were in Interlaken a few years ago. Took the train up the Jungfraujoch and were very well entertained by the Alpine Choughs on the visitor centre balcony. Good view too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FlamboroughBird Thanks. That’s a better map than the one I found. I’ll save it on my phone! 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@penbee8 @TechnicallyRon Oh! How did you manage to get a photo of my (room that’s laughingly called) office?? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FlamboroughBird Evening. I’ve had a look on the map on your pinned tweet in an attempt to locate Cattlemere, but it’s not marked. Could you give me a clue please?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 My sort of photography 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 Heading there Monday. Time for it to paddle across 😳😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomnorris70_3 No indeed. I went into Leeds on one the other Sunday. They certainly rattle along🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomnorris70_3 Northern here in Yorkshire are finally replacing their Pacer trains. Buses on rails. Perhaps they could send them your way for some extra capacity?? 😩😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@indiaknight Trouble is, they want it both ways. Either they’re independent and make their own way, without the taxpayers paying massive security bills, or they take a lower profile but remain part of the Firm. They seem to want cake and eat it. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WildlifeInWakey Will take a look and report back. Thanks for the info! @AlexGlendinning for your info though you probably know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WildlifeInWakey A plethora. Lovely word 🤗🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@little_bittern Still struggling with a Tube Map jigsaw that was straightforward until the 150 white pieces came to be done. Nightmare. A case of keep calm and get repetitive strain injury as you try each piece one by one 🙄😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>⁦@little_bittern⁩ An Angela Harding Barn Owl. I had her RSPB calendar last year and this pic is on this year’s. I really love her work. 👍 Going to be an interesting one to complete, I think. 😱  https://t.co/2V1Mrx03he<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WildlifeInWakey Can’t believe I’ve never birded Thornes/Clarence. Where’s the best place for Tree Creeper? Save me wandering aimlessly in the wrong places 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@little_bittern Happy New Year to you Rob 😊I’ll send a pic of the one waiting for me....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuffolkGazette And has Lorraine Fisher, permanently aged 34, got a portrait in her attic?? 🤔😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 @YorkshireTea Most definitely. We’ve read the menu and made our choices already😂 Ian won’t need a ‘special trifle’ this year. And blush away. What you do for the kids at school is amazing. I’m in genuine awe of you 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you, @YorkshireTea for supporting @sarahjolly1 ‘s Macmillan dinner raffle. Sarah is a real star and an inspiration to so many children. 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simon_reeve Technically, we #pedants are of the opinion that the new decade starts in 2021. Regardless, we’re looking forward to more of your travel (with added sociology, crime, politics etc) programmes in 2020 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RSPB_OldMoor Apparently the word Humdudgeon is the 1700s equivalent for the dread of returning to work.  Or Ergophobia, a fear of work 🙄😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarristerSecret I’m not aware that he has much understanding of any word longer than one syllable. Or 2, when he’s calling someone “nasty”. I seriously cannot begin to understand the workings of his brain. Truly frightening. #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gaviniorr Even my non-birding husband was completely entranced by them. They put on a real display for the watchers #SEO 🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gaviniorr That’s my Tuesday visit, I think. Got to St Aidan’s too late this afternoon to visit both the hillside and Lemonroyd. I’ll let you know how I get on. 👍The SEOs put on quite a display, it must be said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @RSPBAireValley One of the pleasures of birding. Accommodating birds and good company 👍👍😊🦉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent hour spent this afternoon @RSPBAireValley in the company of @AlexGlendinning and 4 #SEOs 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @gaviniorr I was planning on a later ie afternoon walk with the possibility of seeing the SEOs 🤔🤔🤞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gaviniorr Thanks. Il call in on Sunday on my way to RSPB St Aidan’s 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gaviniorr @peter_maugham @SwillyIngsBG How does one access Lemonroyd STW? Park I the little car park by the “oil tanks” on Fleet Lane and walk back?  Is there a path round it? Difficult to tell on Google Sat view 🙄 Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarristerSecret @katebevan Could you please explain to folk the difference between moot and mute, as in “a moot point” please. I write as s/one who had to point out to a colleague that Pre Madonna was not actually how to spell Prima Donna 😳#pedant<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder If you’re struggling with locating that Woodpigeon, let me know. I’ll send up one of the 200+ from the field behind us 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Hmm. I’ve not seen that “view” on my iPad. I’ll have a look.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Alex, which site is this from please?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 Gosh, thank you very much for the detailed instructions. Worth calling in on our way from Wakey to North Yorkshire. Happy New Year to you and Wendy 👍🦉🦆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wendyredrobin @LDV_NNR @YorkBirding Not a spot I know. Off the A19? Are they on the river? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder It’d be rude not to 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wintersett1 @YoloBirder Carrion Crows. Then Woodpigs. Then Blackbirds. Then our Robin. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrkjduffy Happy New Year Kev. Your photos from the rigs were amazing in so many ways so it’s a shame that they will stop coming from other rig-birders. Pity the management can’t see the positive side! 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning 👍I stumbled in on 180. Memo to self. Must do better but I’m still not resorting to twitching. Local-ish only or bona fide holiday in Norfolk!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder Red carpet treatment! Don’t get that down Wakey 😳😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuffolkGazette The best bit is the name of the car. Perfect. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley I’ll let you know how I go on. I’m sure I’ve got nothing better to do than drive myself potty!! 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley That’s me told. I’d better knuckle down then 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley Easy option? Are you quite sure?? I’m trying to decide whether to flog on with the map and drive myself potty, or for the first time ever, give up 😳😳Did you have the patience?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>⁦@rob_yaxley⁩ Your next jigsaw. Am currently where you were, having been bought the Tube Map puzzle for Christmas. Just the 150+ white ones left to go 😩😂😡  https://t.co/8IN8WNN4m4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Red Kite over the Northern School of Dance in Chapeltown Leeds. #RedKite #UrbanBirds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wilgils Brilliant article. My parents died, 86 and 91, 8 yrs ago. They were not online and it would’ve been beyond Dad by then. I needed to take my iPad and a dongle to sort out “online only” problems. Design is for youth appeal, not for arthritic hands. And as for tiny printing 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 Went into one of those in Hebden Bridge by accident many years ago with Ian. The only female in the place. Silence ensued, followed by very disapproving looks. The quickest drink ever! No doubt it’s a gastro pub now or a Spoons 🙄😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley I’ll have a look. Thanks 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Barnsleybsg Had to look up Spinoletta Pipit. Water Pipit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley OK. So where’s the best place to buy a moth trap? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steverichards14 It’s easy to dismiss U.K. trains as a disgrace in a fit of anger. We booked seats on LNER Wakefield-KCross the other week. £38 each return. Train on time to the minute, clean and new.  Not every journey is a nightmare. Xmas week travel is never good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adamboultonSKY I’m very happy for non-politicians and non-civil servants to receive recognition for their efforts. They shouldn’t simply be an expectation for doing a certain job. And can we rename them please? Sadly, certain names overshadow the Good Guys every year. #NYHonours<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley Seriously thinking about getting one. Not as an accessory however.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarristerSecret Well done, but the sad thing is that you’re one place behind Diary of a Wimpy Kid, which to my mind is perhaps the most cynically money-spinning children’s book series of them all.  #allegedly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gavinesler Did they get you there on time? Did you book a ticket in advance with seat reservation? Did you not think that this is the busiest time of year on the trains? And before anyone says the Nationalise word, I’ll remind them that LNER is effectively run by the Government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StansaidAirport @JolyonMaugham I’m with you on that, Stan. I can’t believe the man - a very intelligent and media-aware chap - didn’t anticipate the Twitter storm his admission has provoked. Better to have kept his mouth well &amp;truly shut. I really didn’t need to know he was wearing wife’s kimono at the time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RevRichardColes Lots of people here who have fewer people around the Christmas table. When I lost my parents, I decided to feed other people instead and buy “places” for homeless folk at Crisis. It doesn’t bring them back, but it’s a positive step all round. 🤔🎄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JKCorden Now to me, James, that’s far, far, far more like family life as most of us know it than the depressing scream and shout, violence fest that is a Christmas ‘Stenders.  Your team nailed it. Well done and thank you for the laughs and giggles. And that ending...... 😳😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomnorris70_3 Yes, but never mind that! What was the answer?? 😳🎄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @WildlifeInWakey Me too. Go the long way home from Sainsbury’s to keep an eye on That Tree 🙄🎄🎄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley I’m with you on that one. OH is not a birder, but enjoys finding new walks. We’ve been out and about all over Yorkshire when interesting birds turn up. I’m not a twitcher however - just stay relatively local.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Subtle as ever, me 🙄😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 But not any random cheese, as our German friend serves it. Wensleydale please!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RSPBAireValley Pleased to see 7 Grey Partridge in the field next to our garden this morning. 12 in a different field the other day 👍#Pugneys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProfBrianCox Truly terrifying. This man is effectively the Leader of the Free World, as they say. Utter gobbledegook 😳😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shout out to our fantastic plumber, Rob, of RJW (Ryhill) for sorting out our ailing boiler this close to 🎄 Christmas. He’s an absolute star. 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorfolkBea Indeed, Bea. It’s called Taking Back Control. Though I’m not quite sure how, or by whom. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder @rob_yaxley @WFEcology 🙄🙄What a majestic pun 😂#Brains<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley @WFEcology No.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning It isn’t fine.  The other week it took me 25 mins to get from Pugneys roundabout to the motorway junction at tea time. The Red Kite roundabout needs peak-time traffic lights IMHO. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StansaidAirport Stop it. Otherwise I have no option but to block you. My eyes! 😱😫That is truly disturbingly dreadful. 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @WakeyBirders Well the good news is that, according to the architects’ vision, they’re planning on planting 6 trees in front of it.  🙄 #Marvellous. Has anyone from Highways England looked at the traffic chaos that is Calder Park at teatime BEFORE building this monstrosity?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TonyJuniper Can I also suggest hedge trees? In many hedges, there are mature trees every so many yards. In others, none. They take up little room and simply require the hedge cutter to raise the equipment when he reaches one. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhilWilliamson8 @TonyJuniper Your problem there, as per the North York’s Moors, which are effectively a treeless desert in most places, is the peat and bog, which are carbon sinks. And which don’t need digging up. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson_MP I won’t even mention the creature that is Dominic Cummings. When exactly was he elected? And by whom? Far more dangerous than Morgan and Goldsmith. There, I have mentioned him 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mick_turton Defeated by a bottle of Harrogate Water.  Well done #NorthYorkshire 😂😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AudeoisJohn @jeanthorpeRR @MalleyAndrew I assumed there was some nefarious purpose to it. And it appears I was right. How very depressing that some folk find it a good idea and rather acceptable 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jgsigsworth I think I’m flattered! Being a #pedant just comes naturally, I’m afraid. Latin A level and a degree in Languages sealed the deal 🙄😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jgsigsworth Yes. The Argos team have confirmed it. I thought it sensible to let folk know yet another scam was doing the rounds. The use of English was as much an alert. You’d think the scammers would at least proof read...".🙄😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mel_rowell Yes. The Agos Twitter team have confirmed its a phishing scam. The English used is barely literate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArgosHelpers I assumed as much. Just thought I’d make you folk aware. 🎄🎄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jamiesont I cried laughing at Teresa May being “delighted” at the victory. And JRMogg’s condolences at his colleagues having to represent Northerners. Utterly utterly brilliant. Thank you 😂😂👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SwindonWorld No, not at all. It’s about minority parties being represented. Nearly a million people voted Green, but the Greens won one seat. Tens of thousands voted Brexit Party, but they won no seats. They are unrepresented. It’s First Past the Post versus Proportional Représentation .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@M0kujin @howgilb @SebastianEPayne Tactical voting will have made a massive difference. That was something voters were urged to consider seriously in order to avoid a massive Tory majority. Sadly it failed, seat-wise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you’re feeling utterly discombobulated today, go and do something positive. Put something(s) in your local food bank collection. Why? You know why. 👍🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@InspMorley Re the Traitor and the Spy. It isn’t heavy at all. It’s a real thriller, even though you know the outcome.

<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @mel_rowell @WakeyBirders This has been an ongoing problem. Clearing a site, then not building, allowing scrub and wet areas to develop which in turn create habitats; wildlife moves in and then they start building again... marvellous. Cos we need more car showrooms or whatever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @mel_rowell @WakeyBirders When I wrote my objection to the Lodges, I cited both the loss of habitat on Calder Park and the increasingly heavy traffic caused by the ongoing development of the site. The Lodges would exacerbate both problems.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Our walk in BrettonCP made me consider the logistics of planting 30 million trees pa.  Assuming trees can be planted all year round, that’s 2500000/month. Planting on weekdays, 125000/day, 12500/hour on a 10 hr day.   208/minute and 3.5 trees per second. Hmm ⁦@BorisJohnson⁩  https://t.co/uIkxgnMstN<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@allenscobie @MilesKing10 2/2 one an industrial plantation of pines planted for pit props in the mines but never cut. No birdlife, nothing on the floor except pine needles.

<|startoftext|>@allenscobie @MilesKing10 But there are the wrong trees.  Visit a native deciduous woodland and note the biodiversity. Then visit a Forestry Commission non-native fir plantation - serried ranks of evergreens, dark and sterile. Few birds and mammals. We have 2 such woodlands near us 1/2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Gyropitus @afterglow2046 What he could do is ensure that people whose houses have flooded before can get some form of Government insurance that includes flood damage. Many people affected cannot buy normal insurance that includes flood damage, thus making their houses virtually unsaleable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidschneider Regardless of FoM, the Gov should be asking itself why we need to import doctors, nurses, teachers and scientists.

<|startoftext|>Just back from a couple of days in London. Offered a seat 4 times while standing on the tube. The initial reaction is to think, ‘Oy!

<|startoftext|>@LandEthics @SwaledaleBirds @RichardHRBenyon Stopping building on flood plains would help. Not good travelling through S Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on the train and seeing that  housing estates are being built in very wet areas. Utter madness.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WildlifeTrusts ‘In the wild’ is asking a lot. Outside for most schools will be in a town or suburbs with a local park being the closest to green space.

<|startoftext|>@PoetTaxiDriver @jonnybirder Let’s face it. 1) It was too big a decision to be boiled down to a simple Yes No choice. 2) Most of us didn’t/don’t have sufficient knowledge to make a reasoned choice 3) Too many in 2016 just wanted to give Cameron a kicking 4) We still don’t know what a Deal involves. #Brexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Markthebirder Can I make a suggestion? We did the walk last week with Andy Malley and would have been very happy to have made a donation to your 2 ‘good causes’ (sorry, Jean!) had the possibility arisen.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder IMHO Farage has been the most influence (and Machiavellian) politician this century. If he and UKIP hadn't 'posed a threat' to the Tory Party back then, the Referendum wouldn't have appeared in the Tory manifesto. He's a super-stirrer. 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bryn_ni @jayrayner1 I reported it. Then looked (😩) on the  https://t.co/tcg98KRxN0 twitter feed for reaction. Twitter have basically said it's within their guidelines so Leave have produced a Churchill V sign riposte to the likes of me. #Despair<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@damian_money Saturday’s wind blowing the ‘wrong way’ so our walk to Saltburn was quiet. 7 Curlew on rocks towards Saltburn and 3 Bar-tailed Godwit at Skinningrove. Small flock of birds in the stubble at Hunt Cliff but unable to ID clearly. May well have been the bunting. 🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@damian_money Walking from Skinningrove to Saltburn tomorrow as part of Cleveland Way. Taking bins as usual. Am I right that Huntcliff is outside Saltburn? Where to look? It’s a VERY long time since I was last in Saltburn! Any advice happily received 😊👍<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BarristerSecret Most people are completely unaware of the crumbling state of the judicial system. It’s largely unreported in the MSM. It is v wrong that courts are left empty, Mag Court buildings sold off, judges left ‘underemployed’, cases repeatedly deferred etc.  But this isn’t ‘newsworthy’🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Went for a flood review walk at 18:30 yesterday. Paddled back up the path to the farm and there were 2 Barn Owls in the usual place, watching the ducks etc on the flooded field 👍👍About 30 Swallows and the odd House Martin over the main lake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 Hi Sarah. I think it’s the plastic toys and instant bin-ables inside the crackers that’s the problem, not the crackers. If the kids enjoy the crackers, and they do, see if we can find crackers with just a paper hat and a joke. I’ll keep my eyes open.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spent day with Matt Smith, bird guide on Cyprus 10 days ago. Brilliant! This RFF (his photo) glided past at head height @ Phassouli Marsh.

<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder As I said, let’s stick to the fluffy kittens 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khobr1en100 @andrewpolitics @jonnybirder On average between 2014-2018 we “paid” £18 billion. Of that, 4.6 billion was in abatement ie we retained it as an adjustment. We then received £5.6 billion back in repayments to public and private sectors. I’m struggling with the word “tiny” here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder I think I’m on the verge of just retweeting pics of fluffy kittens and cute puppies in an attempt to retain some level of sanity. 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoutledgeSteve I was unsure. We have a regular grey squirrel which is very bold and comes right up to the house. We also see mice down the garden as we back on to fields. I’ll see if there’s anything online.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bucktonbirder Looks like a rather scary episode of Robot Wars 😳😳😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fetched wellies from their summer stay in the garage. Put them on. Took them straight off. Boots full of plum stones neatly opened by, I assume, a squirrel. 2 questions. How did it access the garage and why leave them in my wellies? 🤔😂#WorkOfArt  https://t.co/SobZ1Dyc66<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RightsPluralist It is. I was bought a guided tour as a gift. It's not far from us but largely unknown due to location. The subsidence damage done to parts by the opencast mining up to the front door is now very apparent sadly. It's a wondrous building.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoKingDevon @BBCCountryfile It rather makes a mockery of all the trails for the competition where they take someone out and about to take photos and encourage us to "get out there". Obviously out into our conservatory 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkAndrew12000 @RightsPluralist They don’t. You can visit but parts of the place are in a state. Nobody lives there as the previous owner, a property developer, hadn’t got the money needed. It’s a very misleading article.   https://t.co/pfnGTonhDx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mojos55 This is rather disingenuous.  The house is owned by the Wentworth Woodhouse Preservation Trust. The NT rejected it due to maintenance costs. It’s recent history is very chequered, passing from owner to owner. This is worth a read.   https://t.co/pfnGTonhDx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alantat @mojos55 It has nothing whatsoever to do with the Moggs today and not for a long while now. It’s a long story, literally. If you want the current state of the building, which is a hidden treasure, google it or read the Catherine Bailey book Black Diamonds.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tompeck @jonnybirder @michaelgove It’s like living in a parallel universe.

<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder Aha. I remember my late Ma asking me years ago what it was she had growing under the bird feeders and when I told her, she had visions of the nee-naws pulling up outside to arrest her. The plants hit the compost heap in a trice. 😂😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Right. Never mind how to pronounce “scone”, is it Plover as in pluvvah (like lover) or Plover as in plohhvah (like clover)? Always thought it was the former, but have heard the latter from 2 people in recent days. 🙄🙄🤔#confused #pedant<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mrchrisaddison My parents, both Tynesiders, supported #RNLI when alive &amp; I’ve continued to do so in their name.

<|startoftext|>@CABS_REPORTS We’re on #Cyprus at the moment and have been out and about walking and birding in some quite remote areas. Eyes and ears open for any illegal trapping. None so far. It’s a beautiful island that needs its tourist income.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustinL74850953 @jonnybirder Sadly, the #RNLI are saying that, while the media hoohaa has prompted a massive rise in donations, they’ve also been contacted by donors withdrawing their support. 2p in the pound it works out as going outside the U.K.  What a sorry story.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If you read nothing else this evening, read this. 😂😱😂😱👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayrayner1 @MarinaHyde “he cuts his hair with the bacon scissors”. I thought it was only my late Mum who had a pair of scissors specifically for de-rinding bacon 😂 And she’d NEVER have attempted to cut hair with them. Hysterical. 👍👍#BorisJohnsonPM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YCNature So sorry tomorrow’s trip is cancelled due to the choppy weather as I was really looking forward to seeing some lifers. Should’ve booked for last month when it looked really calm, but not possible.  That’s British weather!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayrayner1 I buy chicken from our local Farm Shop. It’s not cheap but that’s OK. We eat less meat but better quality meat and pay accordingly. I can tell you which farm it comes from. No way will I buy chicken shipped across the globe. Crazy 😩#FoodAccountability<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope nobody has shown Johnson the clip from LookNorth the other evening, where it came as a surprise to 2 young mums that Boris Johnson is our PM.  Priceless.  If I were tech savvy, I’d do a link, but I’m not, so I can’t 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CABS_REPORTS @Elisabeth_Borne Do you think it would be a good idea to invite her to see these methods in action? Maybe she might then see them as barbaric rather than “traditional” or part of French culture.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Number10cat I hope you’ve kept out of the way, Larry. I just have visions of him storming into No10 in fury and kicking the cat - er dog. #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guyverhofstadt Mr Verhofstadt- many of us in the U.K. would like to wake up and discover that #Brexit is a bad dream. It has been a disaster for this country, splitting the populace in two.  Most of us certainly do not agree with the Wartime imagery and do not view Europe as the enemy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScotsIndyDay @marnanel I’ll never be able to unsee that 😱😩😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_youhadonejob1 “So” when it’s used as a sentence opener instead of “well/er/um/right”.  😬😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hudsonweather I always wonder where on Earth you start to clear up after such an event. A massive logistics exercise,  ever mind the emotional side of losing so much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Nigel Farage is now officially redundant now that Johnson will be Leader of the "Conservative Brexit No Deal Party". Every black cloud has a silver lining. 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahwollaston @Jacob_Rees_Mogg He’s not big and he’s not clever. Poor show indeed. Ill mannered and condescending.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlsBoy Keep them coming Sandra. By god we need something to smile at, at the moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayrayner1 Having a) Spent an evening in Malton listening to you talk engagingly and entertainingly about Food and b) Watched BJ many times err umm ahh err waffling and err humm mm ahh piffling carpe um diem donchaknow on the telly, I think you know what you’re talking about. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crow_artist Hi. I still haven’t received my order dispatched last Wednesday. I’ve tried tracking it via Royal Mail but it’s giving me no helpful information. Any advice please? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProfBrianCox What is remarkable is that it’s the Mail which is finally admitting that a #NoDeal might be anything less than Sunshine And Roses. A pity that they didn’t do this earlier.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Philip Hammond MP currently on R4 quietly sticking it to Cummings and Johnson. Well done to his Constituency Party for readopting him last night, knowing it would upset BJ. #NoNoDeal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesTCobbler Do you think you could arrange a meeting with Mike Ashley and explain to him how it is possible to be an "ethical" leader? He might learn a few things 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StansaidAirport But yer gunna get one. Bring on Brenda from Bristol! 😱😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rees-Mogg calls doctor 'shameful' for raising no-deal drug concerns  https://t.co/1AlgLYdzmc @ByDonkeys Think this is one to hang to for when it hits the fan....🙄😳<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 Pleased to see they’re packed in biodegradable plastic bags too 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesMoir10 @rob_yaxley This really needs to be wallpaper. I’d buy it 🤗😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How a secret plan to close parliament sparked uproar across Britain  https://t.co/5TfC9QBvWD. Blimey. Talk about right and left hand not having a clue. Cummings the Puppeteer pulling everyone’s strings. Err - who elected him by the way??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlsBoy I think it's Esther McVey in disguise. Or Liz Truss 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Words fail me. Please don’t let any Brexiteer talk about Democracy here. It’s utter, utter bullying. When Johnson said Do or Die, this is what he (and Cummings) mean.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeanthorpeRR Those claws!! What a beautiful bird, which you rarely get to see so close. 😳🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrRemain @jonnybirder I’m even more concerned that Dominic Cummings seems to be in charge, not Boris. He makes Farage look like a pussycat. Frighteningly influential and powerful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gavinesler @jonnybirder I’m puzzled -  if/when Brexit happens, what is the point of the Brexit Party? And if there is no point, as it would be redundant, having somehow achieved its goal, what would be the point of Mr Farage?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How many of them have the honour/probity/principles/decency to step down after making statements such as this? Not Hancock, Javid, Gove, Rudd and the rest. They just pretend they never said it and back Johnson. Anything to keep their job. Utter hypocrites, the lot of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder But you see, Jonny, when you’ve got his sort of money and “career”, you’re pretty well immune to whatever a No Deal will throw at you. One day, he’ll get his come-uppance I trust. I don’t give him a minute on my telly. I find him unbearable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@borobarrister @tynesideswifts About a dozen #Swifts above #RSPBStAidans today along with Sandies, House Martins and 3 Whinchat 🤗🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 You’ve done a fine job this holiday on behalf of the Scottish Tourist Board, Sarah! We’ve passed the Falkirk Wheel many times, but I think I’ll suggest we stop next time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Natures_Voice @gaviniorr Absolutely shocking. But can you please not use "put to sleep"? It had to be "euthanised" which is the brutal reality owing to its catastrophic injuries. "Put to sleep" is for explaining to youngsters about elderly or ill much-loved family pets. This was a much darker deed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jacob ReesMogg on R4 Today states there is no one who voted Leave who is not in favour of No Deal. Is he right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirdingAndy @jonnybirder Done.  Gawd help us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stephenfry @wilgils You’re quite right, Stephen. If this had been reported as happening in some Third World country, our media would have condemned it as a coup. #DemocracyUnderThreat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@milogrind @Recordshotmyars Ooh. I thought it was a rather curious Fieldfare 🤔😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/eWpFuDS8HX Please sign if you are unwilling to allow Johnson to suspend Parliament. “A constitutional outrage”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Annie_DLV @jayrayner1 I helped put my MP in Parliament and certainly didn’t vote for a No Deal Brexit. Democracy is for all the people, not just some. We all need representing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crow_artist @Red67book I would’ve added the Raven but it’s out of stock sadly. 😟<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ByDonkeys @michaelgove Neighbours' daughter is married to a sheep farmer. They know a No Deal Brexit will lead to bankruptcy in a short time. Massive tariffs.  They're not sleeping much at night with the uncertainty. Talk about playing with peoples' lives 😩😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crow_artist @Red67book Well, your Gull get me looking at your website and that’s a Kingfisher pin and a Waxy card ordered. 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crow_artist @Red67book Haha! I’d really rather you didn’t as this one is quite beautiful. I was sorry that the #SundayTimes Travel section gave their letter prize this week to someone advocating culling the birds as ‘menaces’ in holiday resorts. Just stop feeding them human food 🙄😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@haveigotnews So veggie nuggets then. Not chicken. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crow_artist @Red67book This is indeed a beautiful portrait, tho some will be wondering where the chips are, as that’s what Herring Gulls are apparently known for 😳😉PS. It would make a fantastic print.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wef @gaviniorr We were in CR in Feb this year. Spent a night at an eco-lodge (no electric once the sun was down) high in the hills. A few years ago it was a cattle ranch.

<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley Ooh thanks for that. I don’t mind it on the drive paviors but I’ll keep an eye out on the gravel in the front. It’s already been inhabited by all sorts 😳<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @StansaidAirport A bit like the old Hedgehog flavour crisps which were, I think, the ‘sweepings’ of every other flavouring powder mixed together. No Hedgehogs were harmed etc etc. 🙄😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @StansaidAirport I'll look next time I'm in a supermarket. It was just a very odd advert. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StansaidAirport There was an ad last night on ITV for Kellogg's muesli which assured us it was "plant based". Just wondering which of their other cereals contain meat 🤔🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankRGardner A couple of colonies (30+) here where I live in Wakefield, Frank. One in the neighbours’ tall privet hedge and another one in the mixed hedge round the corner on the way to the farm.  And another in hedge nr the town centre where s/one puts seed on the pavement every day. 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StansaidAirport Not to worry, Donny. You'll all but own the UK shortly. 😩😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DamianADavis @haveigotnews That's not what it says. He was indeed elected as Leader of the Conservative and Unionist Party and ergo as PM. Elected as such by a tiny %age of the population. So laugh away 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bucktonbirder I think even Scottish politicians are acknowledging that the maximum 6 month sentence allowed (and therefore commuted) is seriously inadequate. About time they acted.  He was a one-man killing machine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WildSheffield Need the other half of the letter please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@haveigotnews I know how he feels. Naps - don’t knock ‘em 😴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YvetteCooperMP Watched an episode of ‘The Thick Of It’ last night, where the Minister and his team were told to stop making up policy on the hoof. Still going on, then 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wakeyweir86 @WakeyBirders Thanks for that. We’ve been down a couple of times and found it locked - and the door damaged. The main lake hide is double locked 😟😟Shakes head.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliemoores @CA_TBoner I’m not a Hunt Supporter and never have been. However, I should point out that he was elected by the public, as all in this post are across the country. It is not a post in the gift of a political party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@european4ever @CarolineLucas The first item on 10o’clock News BBC1 this evening, though Gove says they’ll just be a “few bumps in the road”. So that’s all right then. #NoDeal<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder 🙄Yes, but which ones?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GWandShows Is it just me who is finding these weekly trips to some random person(s) garden increasingly tedious? It just seems like cheap telly 🙄 Can you not come up with something either more inspiring or educational, please?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning It’s called Natural Selection, Alex 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Happy Birthday, old chap. So you’ve swapped your Swaros for......??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wilgils Glad to hear it. I did wonder! No, I've never heard that phrase, and I do "collect" such things as a linguist. 🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tom_c_norris 😂😂That’ll be the day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tom_c_norris Aha. We got ours when Ian retired and well before they hit JLewis. Saw one at Malvern Garden Show and jumped at it. There’s no point in our having a conservatory as the house faces the wrong way, so the MyPod down the garden is a substitute. Clever, eh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 @HorburyBridgeAc Brill idea!! 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tom_c_norris Went to Stonehaven the other weekend with your Ma and Pa. looks a v nice place. Just not sure I was old enough at 55 to be organised though!  Maybe at 75..... 🤔😳 See they’ve got a Pod like ours in the garden though. #TrendSetters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnnymacbirder @mhemingway25 Still there 19:15 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 I looked this up on the web - you need somewhere in the region of 14 million ring pulls according to one site. That’s a lot of collecting. 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bucktonbirder Such iconic birds. Everyone who visits rural Scotland wants to see Golden Eagles, birders and non-birders alike. This just beggars belief. How on Earth it can be dealt with, if at all, defeats me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whitleybaymanc @Recordshotmyars Mine, which I'm keeping to myself, were not much better. A dark lumpy shape which my OH remarked was possibly a dog. Or a rabbit. Sigh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WakeyBirders Survey open next Monday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SwillyIngsBG Sorry to hear that. At least lots of us got to see it, albeit at a distance. Lifer for me. I'm sure the Hospice will appreciate the money collected. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Femi_Sorry Utterly terrifying that a presenter of his influence is so utterly clueless. Gawd ‘elp us. What must be going through so many other minds - people who are confident they know what’s what, as he obviously does, yet who are totally confused? #Brexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@snowmantambo You should try the ‘train’ from Wakefield Kirkgate to Worksop.  On second thoughts, don’t. It’s one of those ‘buses on a train chassis’ jobs. Couldn’t believe it when we travelled on one to meet friends. 😳😩#NorthernPowerHouse<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BirstallBirder I was there twice today - the LB was “resting” first time. There was a large line of folk waiting patiently; everyone behaved themselves, I’m relieved to say.

<|startoftext|>@Ornid @YoloBirder Birding in southern Florida was interesting 🤔Went to one massive reserve run by Audubon and none of the volunteer wardens had a clue what the birds were. They were all lovely people but were asking to look at my book for IDs. Doesn't happen at #RSPB!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Simonmoodyphoto @ChrisGPackham @WildJustice_org @defra I’d be very happy for them all to have a go at shooting that sustainable species, the Clay Pigeon. Or are they just too whizzy and take too much skill to hit? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mickb246 @ChrisGPackham @WildJustice_org @defra My understanding is that the young birds are not bred in the U.K. but shipped across for release. So in that sense, they are very much non-native. I’d be happy to stand corrected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GlendajSharsted @ChrisGPackham @WildJustice_org @defra 2/2 If you drive Sutton Bank to Helmsley, at certain times of year, there are dead #Pheasant (road kill) literally every few yards.

<|startoftext|>@GlendajSharsted @ChrisGPackham @WildJustice_org @defra Last year we walked Helmsley to Rievaulx (NYorks) I counted 52 male #Pheasant in 2 small ajoining fields in the valley bottom before I gave up.

<|startoftext|>@HeckFood Sorry, but who wrote this? It really needed someone to cast their eye over it, if only to punctuate it correctly.

<|startoftext|>@Trolleywise @AsdaServiceTeam I’ve given directions on email. Hope this helps. It’s driving us locals nuts. @Asda Wakefield needs to look at the gap at the back of the store near the Recycling Area and sort it so trolleys can’t be pushed/carried through. 🤔😬<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Trolleywise @AsdaServiceTeam Will do. I’ll even meet you to show you! The trolleys are taken from the back entrance to Asda Wakefield, across 2 fields and dumped in the stream.

<|startoftext|>@AsdaServiceTeam @Trolleywise Emma - there are now 6 trolleys - 5 at the bridge and one in a hedge 100 metres down.

<|startoftext|>Here we go again ⁦@AsdaServiceTeam⁩ 😩 3 of the 4 trolleys dumped in the stream near your store in #Wakefield. PLEASE don't ask me to contact #Trolleywise as I don't think the Wakefield store uses them. This is what happens when you take the  £1 lock off your trolleys 😬😬  https://t.co/uvaf82mvMW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrittonatMarske Sorry. Wasting your time on #Boris. Mention "birds" to him and he'll instantly think of .... well, not the feathered variety. Sigh 🙄😩<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Maybe a Resident Twitter Expert will come to our aid @jonnybirder 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Just a guess. Size not apparent, but that bill.... 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Teenage Starling for me?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hendopolis @MESalisbury @keithmiles42 Why? The stopper has to be sufficiently effective to prevent leakage, so shouldn't be a problem either way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WfldPeregrines @jonnybirder @eddrewitt @JABBIRDART Why can’t they just stick to predating bluddy Woodpigeons? We need more Cuckoos and there’s over 100 Woodpigs in the fields behind #Pugneys, a mere wing flap away for a #Peregrine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@snowmantambo Looks like a job for you here.....#BrandenburgAirport 😱😱😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Ooh.  Which - presume bird - mag is it? Birdguides?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Before you think that #NorthYorks is all Grouse Moor Desert, this is what you get if you walk the #ClevelandWay Ravenscar - RobinHoodsBay. Orchids and butterflies included 👍👍☀️️  https://t.co/UIWvcuzA7p<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevieD131 No I’m not. I was trying to explain that they’re not being moved to be reared specifically to be shot as Grouse etc are. She seemed rather confused on that matter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good to see #HouseMartins nesting in #Ravenscar and #Grosmont this afternoon. A couple of very weather-beaten #PaintedLadies flitting around Grosmont too. #NorthYorkshire<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_BTO @BirdTrack @FrankRGardner Watching @FrankRGardner on his quest to see Birds of Paradise was utterly inspirational. What he went through to fulfil his dream, and the support he had from others, made for exceptional TV. Mega birding 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Biba_OD Not sure whether I agree with the process or not. However the purpose is to rear the chicks in an area where Driven Grouse Shooting is not an issue. The point is to keep them safe from being shot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ViperaDan @FileyBirdObs @BC_Yorkshire @nybirdnews @savebutterflies @insectmigration The #RedAdmirals are already here in the garden at #Marton 👍Along with several #PaintedLadies and #Tortoiseshells. No #Peacocks though 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanielBranch94 Having stood with a group earlier in the year watching a Sloth moving through trees and marvelling at its strange beauty, I'm rather saddened by the thought it might be "smashed" 😩<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Garden in #Marton alive with insects, bees, hover flies and butterflies. Numerous RedAdmirals, SmallTortoiseshell but best of all, several #PaintedLadies 👍#NoSpray #NoWeedkiller  https://t.co/cNYXUYBPbp<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder Wakey "centre" i.e. near the Cathedral is just depressing. So many empty units- parts are very run down and scruffy. I'm afraid we avoid it whenever possible. Last time I went late aft, I found it quite threatening 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was Boris Johnson’s boss: he is utterly unfit to be prime minister | Max Hastings  https://t.co/eCDxwyVY9V A most depressing read, written by a man who knows #Boris only too well. Gawd 'elp us 😩<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MrDominicBuxton @jonnybirder Y5/6 pupils are all expected to write in cursive (joined up) form these days, Nigel.

<|startoftext|>@BarristerSecret @jayrayner1 She was busy defending him big time this morning on R4. Another female guest who knew him was commenting on his temper. AP said she'd never encountered his temper but then admitted she'd met him only once. 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@borobarrister Erm, it was on the telly....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@borobarrister It was on Look North a few weeks ago! I even know where they are.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Number10cat Am interested how Security, which you would imagine would’ve been high for such a ‘Do’, failed to such an extent to allow a large group of protesters inside the building? If they’d done their job, none of this would’ve happened. A lot of people have explaining to do, I think. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@professormalb @FrankRGardner @parkbirdslondon Friends in rural Spain see them regularly and tell me the only bird that eats them is the Spotted Cuckoo. Otherwise they're bad news for inquisitive dogs in particular as they drop their spines and the dogs inhale them with unpleasant results.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankRGardner @AdelAljubeir I can only hope that something was lost in translation here. Normal??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder I can think of less comfortable places 😬😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@julie27716630 @herdyshepherd1 No they're not necessarily visible. If you watched the farmer on #Springwatch monitoring his #Curlew chicks, you can see how difficult it can be in long grass. It's a big problem when fields are cut for silage more than once.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Hardly surprising when you look at the number of plastic bottles etc in the #Pugneys beck - straight into the Calder, over the weir and away to the sea. Couldn’t give a stuff, some folk. Depressing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 Quite what our Dani thought the green stuff was that would just wash off doesn't bear thinking about 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 Shakes head. I think you're flogging the proverbial there. Rather like the enthusiastic replies I get from Asda about trolleys in the beck and would I contact Trolleywise to collect them even tho I tell them that Asda Wakey haven't a contract with them 🙄🙄😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WildlifeInWakey Well, no chance of a clear view of the plumage, sadly. I could see them in the scope, distantly, and then later passed one on the pylon next to the road at 40 mph (as a passenger - I wasn’t driving!) so that’s a no again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sigh 😳😟Says it all, really.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blimey. Worth a listen. Here speaks a man who speaks for me, in a rational, articulate and incisive voice. Well said, Lord H. 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WildlifeInWakey There were 2 #Peregrines sitting on the pylons by #OldMoor not an hour ago. We were speculating that they might be Wakey birds. How possible is that??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Forecast fine tomorrow. I've been round about 18:30 onwards when it's quiet at the top end. All sorts out 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jessphillips I think when people look back, Farage will prove to have been the most influential figure in early C21 politics. A man unelected to the U.K. Parliament yet with a huge hold over the key players. 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RSPBAireValley Your Grey Squirrels are cunning. On the squirrel-proof feeders on the platform, one had squeezed thru the bars and was curled round the central feeder, stuffing its face. The other spent a full 2 mins, hand thru the bars, scraping a fat ball until it was small enough to drop out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@campbellclaret @BorisJohnson The worse news is that #Boris will continue to flounder when, as will inevitably happen, he reaches No10. Truly frightening 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning The dirt path from the farm by Castle Pond was full of Whitethroat yesterday evening. I counted 7 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnLawArt Ah. But it wasn't Yorkshire Portions in our house ...... 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder Right. That's sold the book to me by itself #Redwing 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnLawArt My Gran was. 😩On the odd occasions when we visited and she cooked Sunday Dinner, if was all I could do to clean my plate, as was expected in those far-off days. Leathery meat, watery mash and sludgy greens. Terrible.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@probableroller @jonnybirder @jessphillips @haveigotnews @Stormvogel99 @StephBirdArt @TimMinogue I’m not sure, but I wish Boris would wear a bra. I’m sure he’d find life more comfortable 😩😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave @mhemingway25 That makes two of us. And, controversially, I’ll add Leonard Cohen as well. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Still having a little difficulty with the verb “singing” as far as a GRW is concerned. 🤔😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WfldPeregrines @eddrewitt Hmm! Not quite #ApexPredators yet, then 🙄😂, just picky eaters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Ooh. You’re famous! Just read the roundup for today’s OM sightings and your photos are all over. Well done! 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley Is this Pingicula?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning I’m lagging well behind your 170+, but all things considered, I’m not doing badly 🙄Should be able to get out more and further now 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @RSPB_OldMoor Where did you track them down to in the end?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@methoduk Any chance of being able to buy your cleaning sprays without the trigger? Could simply unscrew a new bottle and transfer the trigger. Or is that a problem?🤔🤔#LessPlastic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mel_rowell There were 2 nests right up by the pavement across the dam end. Both had Coot adult on eggs. Both nests were half plastic. It was the dog-poo bags that made me despair as there's a bin not 100m away 😩😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SeckarWoods #Yellowhammer singing away in open heathland area this afternoon 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicolaHanrahan I’ll email instructions later x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Newmillerdam this aft. The highlight - a pair of balletic Common Tern. The lowlight - 2 Coots' nests, one built largely of dog-poo bags and this one with added crisp packets and plastic straws. Well done #Wakey. Sigh. 🙄🙄😩  https://t.co/V7bJ8gs6sj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Hmm. Marginally better than the ones I managed the other evening in the drizzle  😳🙄😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MyWakefield Look, Wakey, if #Rotherham can get its act together, is it beyond us? Look at the savings too 🤔🤔@wakeynats @WakeExpress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ByDonkeys One for you I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leedsbirder @UoLperegrine @UoL_Sus Think I'm very with you on that one. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leedsbirder @UoLperegrine @UoL_Sus Don't think it'll catch on any time soon! And somehow, staying with the Salisbury flower names for the girls, Leeds Lupin, Lobelia and Larkspur somehow don't do them justice ..... 😱😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnLawArt @JamesMelville @jonnybirder Poor lass can't win. She's also accused of left wing bias by others. I must say that she was asking the question that I would've asked of Boris. And I spelled her name wrong 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leedsbirder @UoLperegrine @UoL_Sus Hmm. Wondering if, after the revelation of the Salisbury #Peregrines names, you fancy naming the Leeds youngsters. Not sure if Pansy and Petunia quite fit the bill 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesMelville @jonnybirder BBC’s Laura Kuhnesberg asked him a pertinent, though lengthy, question which evidently fried his brain. Instead of giving an honest answer, he took the piss out of her and evaded the question. Very disrespectful of her indeed. And made him look like a schoolyard bully. #Boris<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WathBirder @Barnsleybsg I got some good views (and rather record-shot photos) of the #Pugneys GRW this evening after the rain finally stopped. It was in fine voice and quite mobile around the reed bed. What a treat 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leedsbirder @UoLperegrine @ChurchLeeds @UoL_Sus @BBCSpringwatch @iNatureUK @LeedsNews Interesting that the Leeds #Peregrine crew are a fortnight ahead of the Salisbury chicks which are still bundles of fluff as per #Springwatch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry. GRW. Sausage fingers 🙄😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @StevieD131 @Wintersett1 @eddieandrassy Noisy b@gger. I could hear it this evening from the metal bridge across the beck, top end of #pugneys<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 😂Birder speak for an Oystercatcher! Definitely not spotty x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scores of #Swifts low over #Pugneys despite the wind and rain. #Swallows feeding on insects over path by South bank and #Sandies over reserve lake. Oh and a single Oyk on the playing field 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimAshton_ In a very different situation yesterday , I was stuck in a crawling line of traffic in the rain, passing Pugneys CP. We were all being entertained by scores of #Swifts  flying low, almost dive-bombing the cars. It certainly made the wait interesting! Magic birds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 @BirdGuides @RareBirdAlertUK A good use for the app. We have it on our phones for when we go walking, just in case #What3Words<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimAshton_ We inherited an old one in the garden. It's huge. I cut it right back once every 2 years to manage it and it grows 8-10 feet in no time. I'd be wary of leaving the one pictured next to the wall 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesMelville Oh gosh. That's just lovely to watch. Some kids just crave a hug. Wipes eyes. 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbclaurak Does NOBODY brief him properly beforehand so he doesn’t make such ridiculous pronouncements? Or do they do so, but he just ignores it all because he thinks he knows better? Or is he genuinely ignorant? #Trump #IrishBorder<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 😂😂👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wilgils As they pointed out in the paper, Trump just opens his mouth and spouts part-formed ideas. He’s now back-tracking, presumably after an aide has managed to explain to him in simple terms what the NHS actually is. He lives in LaLa Land. When is his term up? 2020?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarolineLucas Indeed. It was announced as a consultation months ago. Other EU countries have successful schemes. Why reinvent the wheel? Surely we can model our on theirs? Or is that too easy? Big Cola and Big Supermarkets putting their spikes in the wheel no doubt.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WYP_CNewsome A pity you couldn’t have noticed some slight defect on his car and taken your time to sloooooooowly check it out. We see far more deadhogs than #hedgehogs, sadly, all squished on the roads. They need every bit of help they’re given. 👍👍<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NicolaHanrahan Your Mum says you’ve got a newly fledged GSWoodie in the garden. I need to introduce you to #BirdTrack so you can log your sightings online. It’s very easy. 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SustEnvFarming 2/2 responsible know they are being scrutinised. I do wonder, however, what is going through the minds of those doing the mowing. Don’t they pause and think, “Hmm. Maybe this isn’t quite right”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SustEnvFarming I wrote to Highways Agency last year re early cutting of verges on M1 N of Leeds, when Cowslips etc were scalped while in full bloom.

<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave @whiterosegreen @Wintersett1 I was there last week. Confused by the Cutting Delayed etc signs, but the roundabout had been scalped. @RSPB_OldMoor Not a good look 🙄😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayrayner1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley We were 240 miles away. She eventually told me, but not until the neighbours on either side, both builders, had repaired the damage for free. They (the neighbours) were livid that elderly folk could be targeted so. Trouble was, our ‘you should’ve’ conversation was too late 😟<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley 3/3 basically threatened to do more damage if Mum didn’t pay them £500. She was terrified. One followed her into the house and she gave him £100 to leave. She rang the Police but by the time they arrived, they were long gone. Quite a scam around the SE. Ma was 80 at the time 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley 2/2 more frightening were the 2 blokes who turned up at the house offering to “mend” the porch tiles. Mum pointed out nothing was wrong and anyway they were going out. When they got back, there was concrete lumps on the drive which the blokes has hacked off. They returned, 2/3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley Both mine are gone, and had no IT access. Mum would be rung by chaps saying they noticed her computer was faulty and offering to repair it. She’d let them prattle on for a while then inform them she wa a little puzzled as she had no computer 🙄However 1/2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Young_Nudger Yes indeed. My local patch has loads of dog walkers.

<|startoftext|>@RuthTingay We've currently got 5 Drake Mallards sitting on our roof and a pair of Mallards in the garden. I'm too terrified to set foot out of the door. What can I do? When can I start shooting them? #IronyAlert. 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarnabyEdwards @OJSpenny At no point was anyone voting for a named person, only a Party. The order of MEPs in the pecking order was determined by the Party leader, I assume. So first on the list was elected if the Party only gained sufficient votes for one seat, and so on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 Would you like a Nepeta to go with them? #Bees<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kevin_Maguire Had a very depressing "conversation" with a young woman the other week. "I know nothing about Brexit. Don't even know what the word means. Not interested. Don't watch the News. Don't read a paper. Don't listen to radio news. Don't care." I didn't know where to start 😩😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you want a garden plant for #Bees then Nepeta aka Catnip is brilliant. Currently sitting listening to all sorts of bees buzzing. Cut it back when it's flowered and you'll get a second flowering. Tall or low-growing plants available 👍👍😊😊  https://t.co/H3Db1SGrqS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnLawArt I totally agree, dangerous as it might prove. If you can't be bothered to vote willingly, who do you vote for if obliged to by law? Loads of spoiled papers I imagine 😳or random crosses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnnymacbirder The saddest thing is that the turnout for Yorkshire and the Humber was only 33.5%. That’s shockingly low.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LettersDesk Or a self-deluded one 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elli_rivers @WildJustice_org Out of interest, who are you aiming the petition at? I forwarded the original article days ago to the main supermarkets and had no response whatsoever. It's not a UK Gov issue as it's not happening here. It's pressure from major olive oil buyers that's needed. 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well done @HighwaysYORKS for reining in the mowers. The verges on M1 North of Leeds are a wildflower meadow. Billions of flowers all left intact. Oxeye daisies have taken over from the Cowslips. Thank you 👍👍🌸🌸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@snowmantambo Shocking article in today's Grauniad. The whole thing needs proper regulation in so many ways. #Everest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@snowmantambo That's better! I'm glad you have a sense of humour 😳😳Gather you're being left the Bronze Behemoth to go on holiday in. Your Dad's pride and joy! Good luck with reverse parking it in a narrow spot 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@snowmantambo Well you'd better translate. That came thru as a row of question marks 🙄😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder Along with the 3 years you’ve spent closely reading Terms and Conditions 😳🙄😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 And as for your Little Tern shots, there were just 2 on the South Scrape when we were there. Both sat resolutely motionless, facing the opposite direction. So I have record shots of Little Tern backsides 🙄😳😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 We had a good day at #Minsmere 10 days ago. Little and Sandwich Terns, Cuckoo, loads of Med Gulls, Beardies, Hobbies, etc etc but dipped the Savi’s and the Dartford Warblers sadly. Always next time 🤔👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimAshton_ Do you have any spare seed? I’d like a bash at germinating some. I can DM my address if you do. What do you then do with the young trees? With recent talk of planting thousands of trees to mitigate global , I’d have thought the more the merrier, so to speak.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning You found them then? Is it the stony “beach” near the cafe?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevieD131 I retweeted this with comment to all the UK major supermarkets. Response? Nil. Nada. Nul. Rien. Zilch. Nothing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @RSPB_OldMoor Good to bump into you again. The Spotshank was right at the far end of the flash, then flew off to hang around nearer the path with the Greenshank. Then wandered off behind a little island and that was that. Lovely seeing all the wee Avocets though. #AdwickWashland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wintersett1 @BeckyBailey101 Am calling in later. Will try to track it down 😳😳#Fudge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nazirafzal It’s another form of National Self-flagellation. We’re 1 of the top 5 financial contributors to #Eurovision, but don’t understand whats required song-wise.Time to pull out of the whole thing, withdraw our money and retain a bit of National Dignity. Bit being the operative word.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeckyBailey101 Is it viewable from GRW viewpoint? Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 A good place for Hares, we find. Usually see 4 or 5  #Adwick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nicolawriting @StevieD131 @Tesco @sainsburys @LidlGB @AldiUK I retweeted this to all UK supermarkets as soon as I read it, and have had not one reply or acknowledgement. Disappointed but not surprised.  What did Waitrose have to say?  I'll repeat my tweet. 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bucktonbirder Erm- give us a clue....🤔😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMontyDon @Sven_Wair Many years ago, when peat-free compost became available, GW did trials using peat v peat-free alternatives. It’s such a long time ago, it would be worth repeating. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sven_Wair Not just us then. We’ve had a pair of Mallard in our garden for nearly a month now. When they get bored of eating my garden, they fly on to the roof. Then another 4 drakes turn up regularly, trash the pond and sit on the roof. Bluddy Duck Delinquents. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well I’m glad to read these manifestos. It’s all clear now. Or not. 😩😂😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevieD131 Or even yachts 🙄😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wintersett1 @Fitzybirder @CroftonBirder @StevieD131 @grayspeight @BeckyBailey101 @Barnsleybsg @BirdGuides Hi. Where to view it from? Same place as Chris suggested on his map for the GRW? 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MartinRadford10 @Barnsleybsg We go regularly. The Bolton end (where the water is) is a proper path but fenced in. If you park in the "main" road car park it's open at that point. However I've never seen dogs in the water. The birds are close in places but undisturbed. Worth the visit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Millions of birds vacuumed to death annually in Mediterranean  https://t.co/cTManTroYk Are any of the UK supermarkets aware of this practice? Can they bring their purchasing power to bear to have it phased out? @waitrose @sainsburys @asda @tesconews @MorrisonsNews @AldiUK @LidlGB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @MyWakefield At the risk of a cliche, Ride-on Mowers aka Boys’ Toys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @MyWakefield My thoughts exactly. He was in the central reservation when I passed. The mowers were busy on the verges. They’ve also scalped Pugneys, its “playing field” and bizarrely the huge unused field by the river. Not how I want my Council Tax spending please!! 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnTobytyke @Barnsleybsg @RSPB_OldMoor Right. I know where the Symphony "compound" is as I've driven past with OH on way to Darfield. Will investigate tomorrow afternoon. Thanks 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Barnsleybsg @JohnTobytyke @RSPB_OldMoor Sounds like wellies in order then 🙄 I'll have a look on a map for Park Springs. Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnTobytyke @RSPB_OldMoor @Barnsleybsg Not been to Edderthorpe yet. Where to park and where to access? Is it a "stand and look" or a circular walk? Any advice  gratefully received 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, @MyWakefield , this is worth a read. The mowers have been out again today, scalping verges from J39 M1 to #Pugneys. Every daisy, buttercup &amp; dandelion gone. Nature doesn't stand a chance in this Authority sadly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirdGuides Who even knew in the U.K. that this was happening?? Are the supermarkets and manufacturers aware? It’s horrific. The workers obviously know as they’re having to pick out the dead birds. Come on, EU; sort this out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Recordshotmyars Indeed. I can barely identify this as a bird, though as it’s flying, I assume that it is one. Seriously, I just wish my decent shots were as good as these “record shots”. Some people just set their bar wrong...... 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeborahMeaden Sadly, he's viewing it as a not-People's Referendum popularity contest and has no intention of formulating an actual manifesto.  I don't suppose he's given anything else a minute's thought. Who is bankrolling him btw? #Farage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@uffordparkhotel Yes, and it shows. Lots of mature trees on the golf course with proper ponds, not just water hazards. Bushes and gorse for wildlife to occupy. Very different to so many rather sterile courses. We enjoyed the perimeter walk too, with loads of birds in the trees around the edge 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well done ⁦@uffordparkhotel⁩ for putting up #Swift boxes - even though BlueTits have occupied one! Tawny Owls in the golf course trees and Egyptian Geese on the pond too 👍👍  https://t.co/Z24J74i6D5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder GRW heard at 15:30 this afternoon but too deep in the reed bed to see. Certainly set the RWs off when it cranked itself up 😳Thanks for the location map. Cettis a bonus too 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @WfldPeregrines 🙄🙄How did it manage to find that?? They're always deep in hedges when I hear them 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@haveigotnews Bonkers. But I assume it's because Mr F-word was on QT with reps of other parties, but Ms Allen would be unchallenged on HIGNFY, so to speak. Although Jonny Mercer might say Hislop will challenge forcefully if necessary 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mizaru33 OMG. OMD 😳🙄😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder They remind me of #Albufera, Mr Birder. I stood listening to one as I got off the bus at the reserve entrance this time last year 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right. Question Time switched straight off. I can’t bear to have Nigel Farage in the same room as me, even a digital version of the man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vicky_McClure Oh dear, Vicky. I've just sat and blubbed for an hour, watching you and your brilliant, brilliant choir. What an emotional hour. Thank you for being the architect of such a fantastic programme. You're an utter Treasure. #Dementia #MyDad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder Once heard, never forgotten. Akin to dropping a bag of spanners someone said. I tend to agree 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@birdman1066 @borobarrister @ChrisGPackham @Pauline_Latham @TonyJuniper @NaturalEngland @IoloWilliams2 Are we sure this isn’t an Art Installation?  😳🙄Rather like Christo wrapping the Reichstag? This is utterly barking and the sooner it stops/is stopped, the better. #Netting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @WakeyBirders Several over Asdale Road at lunchtime. Not good trying to count them and drive at the same time, so it’s “several” 😳😳#Swifts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J_S_Snowden Hi Joe! Daughter and Mr Holt on train together yesterday and she asked about the two of you on my behalf. Glad that you’re both doing well. Gather your Cambridge results were as I’d have expected for you both 🤗 Well done!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mn_reeder I may have to pick your brains when you’re back in the U.K.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leedsbirder @UoL_Sus @YorksWildlife @_BTO @UoLperegrine Leeds to Suffolk is quite a trek. I remember the incident where she sat on the wall, in the photo, with her own bodyguard. Such a shame to lose such a beautiful bird.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mn_reeder Did you visit ‘privately’ or with a guide?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 Australia! Or is it Austria?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaF1fan @plantmadman  https://t.co/4viWiotS0v<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alexander_Lees @BirdwatchExtra No, I realised that, but replied just in case. Sadly, the parakeets and parrots are very charismatic birds and I can easily see why people in CR keep/kept them. Much better seeing them flying wild, however, even if they are a bu55er to ID on the wing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaF1fan @plantmadman I'll look them up in my RHS book when I'm home and let you know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnLawArt @mn_reeder Where's the Willet? Not on my patch #Pugneys ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alexander_Lees @BirdwatchExtra Not that I'm aware of with my comment. It was purely anecdotal. However, several of the rescued parrots at #LasPumas rescue centre "spoke Spanish" and had obviously been household pets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirdwatchExtra We were in Costa Rica recently. Our guide told us that until recently it was the norm for most households to have a pet parrot. Some of the younger generation are starting to challenge that norm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whiterosegreen Although, on reflection, someone standing there with a megaphone, shouting, “Get out of there, you daft tw@t” might be more effective all round. #LittleTerns<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaF1fan @plantmadman They look like white bluebells (🙄) from here. I have several clumps in my garden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whiterosegreen Education needed. Could the local newspaper or local news do a feature? Bigger and more frequent notices? Sadly some folk are utterly care-less. #LittleTern<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you missed this, watch it on catch-up. An utterly inspiring but heart-breaking programme. #Dementia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mn_reeder Oh lucky man! Enjoy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CraigCThomas1 @FlamboroughBird We climbed Pen-y-ghent last year and came across a large group of youngsters at the summit. They were from a school near Tower Bridge in London. They were just sitting in silence, listening to the silence. It was a pleasure seeing their joy 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trevt49 @RSPBAireValley @RSPB_N_England You can access both reserves without going through reception, as you have to do at, say, Old Moor. So you don’t need to show your card, though I do.  But now, I’ll just leave my card on the dashboard for someone to check. Assuming someone will check..... 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirdLife_Malta And yet again, @VisitMalta @VisitMaltaUK , this is why I won't be visiting your island any time soon. Which is a real shame as I'd enjoy the history. #IllegalHunting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@morss_alex @YoloBirder @ChrisGPackham Yes, but never in the UK. In Mallorca, in 3 different nature reserves. Their song, once heard, is unforgettable. I just stood for ages, listening. #Nightingales<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Hmm. I've looked for both in the past ..... and failed. Dandelions don't count, methinks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gavinesler Matt Hancock MP still flogging that horse this morning on #Today R4. Unfortunately he couldn’t hear me shouting at the radio that there is quite possibly another interpretation 🙄🙄😡<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KeithSaunders9 @Barnsleybsg We’ve had a pair in our garden for 10 days now. They seem to have settled in permanently. They’ve trashed the pond, eaten the tadpoles, polished off the pond weed and spend the day under the bird feeder. It’s marvellous, living with Nature 😳😳😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Just done a quick recce of patch. 40+ #Swifts at top end of #Pugneys Main Lake 👍👍Whitethroat; Chiffchaff in pile of cut willows on Castle Pond, Wren, Kestrel on Farm Buildings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulsedd @CrimeGirI I sold mine 3 months ago for more than I paid for it 6 years ago. Always worried it would get nicked as many do, for parts or export. The new one isn’t going to help matters!! #Defender<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CrimeGirI Saw the press release pics yesterday. As an ex-Defender owner, I shook my head at everything. Can’t imagine the people who NEED a Defender to be thrilled by this Discovery lookalike. Wondering if the Defender Evoke will also be available 😱😩😡Just very wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MalleyAndrew I’m in Pickering at the weekend. I’ll pop along if that’s alright with you !! 😳😳😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WildlifeInWakey Our birdbox turned into a wasps' nest last year. Completely covered in "paper" with a hole underneath for access. I'll see if I can find the photo. Amazing insect engineering 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 Excellent day at @bolton_abbey yesterday. 8+ Pied Fly, WoodWarb heard, Mandarins, Common Sand, Dipper etc and loads of Sandies nesting in the Barden Bridge riverbank. Lovely weather too. Good call - thank you! 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OcelotNick @Bucktonbirder @bradinho8 @birderkettle @ExeterCouncil Every Council should employ a qualified Ecologist who should have an overview of the schedule for mowers and hedge hackers. Then stupidities like this and too many others wouldn't happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidVonHoney That's the case with garden birds but doesn't cover the likes of Curlew and Lapwing. In those cases, it's habitat loss and disruption and moorland burning that are 'not helping matters'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pauloleveller @jonnybirder @BirdGuides @grayspeight If it's as foggy as here near #Pugneys, I'm surprised you can see anything!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 Looks to be a fine day tomorrow so we’ll give it a go. Thank you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wendyredrobin @bolton_abbey @nybirdnews What’s the Pied Fly situation? Is it worth the drive up yet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder He'd be buggred at our surgery. 8/11 GPs would be off his list of acceptable medics. He'd have a very long wait....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder I’ve just looked at his Twitter output. He’s a very angry man. It must be hard work maintaining that level of outrage against the world. And not very good for the soul either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkAvery So that's what Mr Clarkson needs telling. Have you read his column?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkAvery Irony? His column reads that corvids etc can now no longer be shot at all.  I understood that licences can still be granted, or am I wrong? Not that I’m about to shoot any, just that I despise Fake News.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RSPBAireValley @SwillyIngsBG Could you encourage people to use the blank column for time seen please? If a bird was about at 8:30 and you’re arriving at 9:30, it gives you a better idea of your chances of finding it at that location, whereas if you turn up at 15:30......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkAvery Mark, can you please contact Jeremy Clarkson in his capacity as a farmer and as a journalist and explain to him properly what is happening re licences. His piece in this week’s STimes was big on entertaining writing but short on fact IMHO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@littleramstudio @M_Z_Harrison I think you have to be a small, thin person to get down the steps, open the door with difficulty and go inside. Not good design 🙄😩. But then again, it’s just all dreadful in so many ways.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@littleramstudio @M_Z_Harrison I had to look closely at the door. There's a couple of steps up into the non-garden 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@M_Z_Harrison I bet it's one of those fake trees that restaurants have in the middle of the room, that don't shed leaves in your dinner 😳😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder Yay.  About time that one got another airing 😂👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TedHastingsAC12 Mother of God, Ted!! What do you think you're doing to our collective blood pressure?? 😱😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChefTomKerridge A little puzzled by your Tagliatelle with sausage ragu in ST mag. 100g sausage meat - serves 4-6 people ?? Not in our house it wouldn't 😳. And if it makes 4 meatballs, that's 2 people with sausageless ragu 🤔And post-marathon, I'd need feeding properly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnLawArt @jonnybirder Well I'll either fit in well or lower the tone even further then!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TicesMeadow I was watching our newly arrived WTs and explained to a local regular dog walker who always enquires what there is to see, that WT were easy to see as they 'perch up'.

<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Usually a group of Turnstone around near the piers, often behind the kiosks opposite the Magpie.

<|startoftext|>@Springborn21 90 series maybe 😳 At least Hislop engages; some programmes, you struggle to remember if Merton had spoken at all. And having seen him in his one-man show, this disappoints me as he can be utterly brilliant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mcsuk @simon_reeve @DeborahMeaden This Bottle Deposit Scheme seems to be dragging its feet. Has Mr Gove quietly forgotten about it?? Or is Big Cola getting in his way?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bernoid Oh to have a fraction of your talent, Bernoid. On average, how long does each page take and do you ever think of publishing them? 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tomifonication I just think that if it needed a serious interrogation, then this was the wrong programme for it.  And while I’m at it, I wish Mr Merton would retrieve some of his erstwhile rapier wit; he’s rather too laid back these days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tomifonication Well in this case, yes. My opinion; sorry if you disagree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@haveigotnews @zoelyons @JohnnyMercerUK Sorry, Ian, but that was just awkward and uncomfortable watching. It was a “conversation” to have in private, not on HIGNFY. It didn’t make for good viewing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MelisssfMelissa @MonicaCollantin Indeed. I’m due to get my SP in early July, when I’ll be 65 and a half. I calculated how much I’ve “lost” since the SP age changed, compared to ex-colleagues who are a little older and who got theirs at 60. It runs into tens of thousand of ££. Feel like I’ve done my bit already!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martinroper5462 @RSPB_OldMoor @Natures_Voice We regularly see 3 or 4 #hares from the path, looking across the "lake". Great to see so many.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@costadeldeen I suspect so, as they're not a native plant. Native to central and Southern Europe and Americas. I do have one in my garden however. Could've been seed-transfer by bird I suppose?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @CroftonBirder And mine was same day 26 April at St Aidan's. Looking forward to seeing them again. An iconic bird. #Swifts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder I'm with you on that one. The look of bewilderment (well that's rather anthropomorphic of me) on his face was a revelation. However, he did seem to skip the wordy bits though so that's reassuring ..... 😳😳<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RSPBDoveStone Had the BBQ been left behind, unattended? Or were the picnickers still there? In either case, a large bucket of water over it (and them) would be in order. Cannot believe the wilful stupidity of some folk. 😳😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kevin_Maguire @Scotmaritime Admiral on R4 Today explaining it goes back centuries to the idea of a ship/boat protecting the lives of the sailors in a mother-like way. Hence She.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hwallop OH is currently not allowed alcohol due to meds so has been investigating 0-0.5%. St Peters Without, Nanny State (Brewdog) and Adnams Southwold (big M&amp;S only) are keeping him happy. M&amp;S have a growing range to try.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WildlifeInWakey Sure it wasn't an abandoned bicycle? 🙄😂#Gropper<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lepista I agree with the accommodation and think most MPs would travel unrecognised on pub transport. Do wonder if current climate wld allow for others to do so safely? Also think expenses are abused. Too often stuff is claimed when it should just be paid for. That's what salary is for!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lepista Struggling with the phrase "moral code of conduct" for too many of them 😳🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lepista It’s unbelievable that such loopholes exist to allow this to happen. But then again, I assume the MPs themselves set the rules. Quis custodiet custodes, as Boris would(n’t) say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CABS_REPORTS Thank you for your ongoing work. Stay safe and look after each other. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Garganey at AnglersCP eventually 👍Spotted by OH as I was busy scanning the wrong places 🙄⁦@Wintersett1⁩  https://t.co/di5qEwXTTY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlsBoy Well I suppose something that he writes has to be right occasionally, amid all the usual methane-producing stuff he usually spouts. Problem is spotting it. He must've used a researcher to Ghost that bit 🙄🙄🤔#BoJo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlsBoy  https://t.co/fJdDJeEo3o. Sadly, he's not too wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevieD131 @Wintersett1 @CroftonBirder @Fitzybirder Couldn't find it last time I came, partly because I don't know where to look. Which end is the shallows and assume CP is the "public" lake? Thanks 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SwaledaleBirds She was on R4 Today a few mins ago. She comes across as thoughtful, calm, gentle and very intelligent. She also discussed her Aspergers. As for her voice, she was easy to listen to, and her English is more fluent that that of many native speakers interviewed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Well that's a bit of a giveaway, Mr Birder 😳😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SwaledaleBirds Several Swallows mooching around Ryedale Openair Folk Museum in Hutton Le Hole on Saturday. Also Willow Wabs in their orchard. And could hear #Curlew burbling in the fields beyond 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davepullan The only down side being rice and beans every day for breakfast 🙄A very beautiful country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And we think that autocorrect is bad enough. 🙄The eccentric old lady on "The Durrells" has apparently lost her hair due to syphilis according to the subtitles. She actually said Erysipilas. 😳😳ooh err.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmm. Not what I was expecting under the feeders this afternoon. They've had a quick dip in the garden pond, all 6ft by 4ft of it. Am trapped in the house as I don't want to scare them off ..... 🙄🙄😂  https://t.co/6vcSMmWCaE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SwaledaleBirds @VoteAndyBrown Drove from Hutton Le Hole to Chimney Bank yesterday. Large area had been burned. One Lapwing, one grouse seen. Like a desert. Terrible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Number10cat Terrible news. We were there 2 years ago. It is a beautiful, stunning country and we were looked after wonderfully. What a tragedy for those lovely, lovely people. #SriLanka<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisNTwell There is lots about but parts of the moors have been badly burned. Pick your spots carefully!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisNTwell Drove from Hutton Le Hole to Rosedale Chimney Bank at lunchtime. Moorland had been extensively burned. It was like a desert. One Lapwing, one Red Grouse seen. #NorthYorkshire Glad there's some life left elsewhere. 😩<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning The Kes family have occupied that space for several years. Always rather a squash for 4 big chicks, I've thought. Maybe birdie common sense has prevailed and they've found a bigger nursery? 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Why am I not surprised. So many dog walkers around CW encourage their dog(s) to enter the water. The fences just aren't adequate. I despair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning The Kestrels seem to have moved to the other side of the farm buildings this year and a pair of Stock Doves have moved in to the space 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobinCSimpson Thoroughly enjoyed Much Ado this evening at the #LawrenceBatley in Huddersfield. Thank you for your fantastic performance as Benedict. Glad I wasn’t sitting in the second row....... 😳😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave @birdman1066 The trouble is, Countryfile et al just seem happy to do nicey nicey, when the nasty nasty facts are required 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayrayner1 Indeed. Any Y6 pupil will tell you that this is a "comma splice" and as such is grammatically incorrect. #SPAG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenGeoRae @Wintersett1 @ulverstonTC @AldiUK @marksandspencer Interestingly, our recently renovated #Aldi in Wakefield has a huge poster boasting of its environmental credentials. I'm surprised @AldiUK are happy to be so anti-nature in this regard??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MonsieurSharp I don't mind flippant!! I rather like the Thatcher note-I hope it's true as it's real living history. I think they'll be gathering masons from across Europe to do the restoration. I know the York fire resulted in several apprenticeships so every cloud etc etc 🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MonsieurSharp @William75537543 @NiceEtoile @thehistoryguy @DavidOlusoga The masons who were involved in rebuilding the damaged parts of York Minster did this. They left their marks and 'updated' some of the gargoyles. It was a recreation but a personal one in places.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A few of the literally thousands of #Cowslips decorating #WaltonColliery Nature Reserve yesterday. Never seen so many 🤗  https://t.co/naXnrMeqpN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SeckarWoods walk this morning yielded 5 Brambling, LongTailTits, Blue Tits, Great Tits, Chiffs, Chaffs, Willow Wabs, Wrens, GSWs, bluebells and a lot of peace and quiet once away from the road. 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Baghdaddi @DavidLammy The problem here is that 'The BBC' in threads such as these refers to one section of the BBC i.e. News and Current Affairs. It does not cover Drama, Entertainment, the Weather, Natural History etc etc. which most people watch and which have nothing to do with political bias.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mel_rowell Thanks Mel. I know Sandal Residents Assoc do a litter sweep but they just do Barnsley Road. I’ll have a word with someone on that group and see what I can do. Even 4/5 is better than 1. 🤔I’ll get back to you. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@raubrey Yes. Horticultural Grit. In bags smaller than the peat-size ones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@raubrey I use crushed egg shells or very sharp grit around my Hostas but will try begging coffee grounds from a local cafe 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@raubrey And if you Really Must use slug pellets, put them in a small plastic bottle, lay it on its side with the open neck touching the soil. Slugs can crawl in but birds etc can't access the pellets or the dead slugs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simongerman600 @Wintersett1 Oh my. Where on earth do you start with that? Even if it could be cleared, where would it be disposed of? And the next ride would bring more. Assume rubbish is dumped in local rivers to wash down to the sea?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RSPBAireValley The paths north of #Pugneys desperately need a litter pick. We do what we can, but it's a team job. Loads of washed-up plastic bottles stuck on inaccessible banks on beck,and litter dropped from #Asda. Just need a team!! 😩😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Spindlelegs @CroftonBirder Oh dear. Vine Weevil. That's your Hostas buggered. The grubs are expert at chewing through the roots of certain plants where root meets leaves/stem. Plant keels over. I'm afraid I dispatch VWs on sight. They've cost me a fortune in the past 😳😳😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hundreds of #Sandmartins over main lake. skimming surface. Magic. #Pugneys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley OMG. I'm 65 and don't do many of those yet. Except nap in the daytime, but only in winter on the rare occasions when the gas fire or central heating is on. Because in our house you just put another jumper on if it's cold 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnLawArt Yes, it was that one or the 'blue group'. 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Anything to do with a pair of LRPs?? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Bit like when we were camping in Somerset and noticed some Buzzard circling nearby. The campsite owner asked if we'd been watching 'The Tourist Eagles' 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnLawArt Thank you! A real mix of styles, unlike the other artist we were discussing. Not sure which my favourite is, but I’m tending towards the back view of the people in blue strolling on the beach. Or the sepia Stonechat. Or...... 🙄👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorfolkBea Glad to see the abseilers are in now. What a pity the council didn't follow the original advice from @RSPBintheEast in the first place and none of this would've been necessary. Have a virtual drink 🍹 on us, Bea, for your efforts. 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidTu32978822 It's not being developed. The sandy cliffs are eroding. The RSPB advised one way of action and was ignored. Hence all this mess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leedsbirder @MicklefieldLS25 So the hedge has been netted even though planning permission has not as yet - and possibly may not be - granted? That really should not be anywhere remotely legal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Richard70830401 @birdersagainst @glenmoore30 @UoLperegrine @NetsNot @Tesco And Waitrose, m’dear! 😉😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CooperJayKay Our big Asda has trolleys in shelters dotted around the car park, not next to the building. That’s to keep the rain off, I suppose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glenmoore30 @UoLperegrine @birdersagainst @NetsNot @Tesco The "retail operational risk team". Says it all, really. They can't possibly move trolleys or steer customers away from walking under nests for a few weeks of the year 🙄🙄 That would require a little lateral thinking and compassion for Nature which is incompatible with profit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martinRSPB Sadly, Martin, a lot of folk have NO relationship with nature. They'll walk their dog and feed the ducks (with bread) and that's about it. I think our national problem with litter and fly tipping is reflected in that lack of Care for the natural environment. It's 'not my problem'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevieD131 Had a good walk round Anglers. Sandies, Blackcap, Willow Warblers, Oyks and Wigeon all present and correct.  Not sure how best to access the Top Res or where the Hare Field is however! Pair of Yellowhammer and several TreeSparrow by the feeders 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevieD131 The Smew seems to be commuting between you and us. I'll catch up with it eventually 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevieD131 Right. Got our passports ready. Coming over to the other side for a walk and a bit of birding as a change from #Pugneys. Anything worth seeing?? 😳😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leedsbirder @SwillyIngsBG @RSPBAireValley Ooh no. Don't make me choose. Both calls make me 'shiver'. The Curlew is so plaintive and eerie, while the Lapwing reminds me of my late Dad messing with an oscilloscope (he was an elec engineer) with its swoops and zeeps noises.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leedsbirder @SwillyIngsBG @RSPBAireValley It's their "electric" call that I love. Sounds quite unlike any other bird.. #Lapwing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@badgerwatcher1 @Burforders @KFor_Karl Hmm. Maybe I'm not as generous as you. It's what it felt like. Thanks.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@costadeldeen I think my husband will stop watching SCD with me. He too admires Darcy for her intellect and charm, I'm sure 🙄,but we both agree that she's the classiest judge yet. Shame she's off elsewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorfolkBea Me too. Don't know how I found time to work these days 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorfolkBea Nothing is as knackering as teaching a Y11 class last thing on a Friday, holidays impending or not. I hope your kids appreciate you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RSPBintheEast A calm and measured response. Tend to find that Institutions respond better to that, but pull up the metaphorical drawbridge if people get arsey. Well done for keeping cool and authoritative. Good luck for a favourable outcome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dawson58Dawson I finally found the TB Goose this morning in with the Pinks, along with a pair of Wheatear and my first Willow Warbler of the year, all to the soundtrack of booming Bittern. Have decided St Aidan’s would be a lot easier to ‘cover’ if I could get my pushbike into my VW Up 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeanhoodauthor Don't worry. There are lots of other versions of it being retweeted by folk. I just despair at the lack of Care/Humanity/Awareness by Council workers. And others across other industries where this is going on.  ££££££ is all some folk understand. 😩😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeanhoodauthor I'll sign. The trouble with petitions at the moment is that Parliament seems to have little time for running the country for some reason and I suspect it'd get short shrift 🙄🙄😩#Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sven_Wair I just can't believe that North Norfolk, which is renown for its birdlife, reserves, birding holidays etc etc, has made this monumental blunder, for want of a better word. Do they have no one who is wildlife-aware on the Council??  Unbe-bloody-lievable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StonesGary Well I dipped on the Egyptian. Too busy talking to @JohnLawArt 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StonesGary @Barnsleybsg @JohnLawArt @RSPB_OldMoor OH drops me at OM while he visits his Dad in Darfield, then we go for a wander at Adwick. Lots to see at the moment. Can add PF Goose to your list. 👍Also good seeing so many hares on far side of water.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StonesGary @Barnsleybsg Was there a couple of hours ago and met the estimable @JohnLawArt who tracked down the LRP for me. First #Swallow of the year for me, flying over 👍👍#Adwick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorfolkBea Bea - what exactly is 'sandscaping'?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RSPBintheEast @YoloBirder @Stubuck1 @NorthNorfolkDC @Natures_Voice @NorfolkBea @patrick_barkham @donnaloubishop This netting "trend" is becoming depressingly familiar. We know that wildlife is struggling 4 space in many areas &amp; yet some people seem to have no connection whatsoever to the non-human world. If we all followed the simple message "Be Kind", then other solutions would be found.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anyone here use #Birdguides notification service? Am struggling with the location filter as I want more than one area and can't seem to do that. Anyone help me here?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Happy birding Mr Birder. At least you stand a better chance of getting back into the UK with the #Brexitshamblesflextension thingy. 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave @Recordshotmyars They'll be charging a fiver a time, which to be honest is a bargain 🙄😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarrenStarkey A Partridge in a Pear Tree sprang to kind as I was reading that list. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigpaddymartin @Donny_Birder Sorry 🙄 it's the pedant in me coming out. The loss of the funicular is causing problems for lots of folk, not just birders. It needs a lot spending on it, so who knows what will happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigpaddymartin @Donny_Birder Or even the funicular. 🤔 It's not just in need of repair; the company has gone into administration and it seems it'll be closed for months now. Think the only answer is to get your boots on 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jessphillips You'd have my vote for that alone, Jess. 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McKenzie6593 @simmonite_dave Oh the irony. "Skylarks". You couldn't make it up. Nuff said. 🙄😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder Busted. Women, eh? 🙄😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redshepherdess I believe the term is #Riggwelter. Hence the name of the beer. If you drink enough of it, you fall over.  Rather like what may happen with many drinks 😳🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you think all business people are in it for themselves, read this. Mr Timpson is an inspiration.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley ????😱<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@fairburnjohng I did Google whippets roaming etc. Guess what. Nothing. Nada. Niente. Zilch. There is no ancient permission. He's off his head on bu11sh1t. 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SwaledaleBirds Good! Will do later today. I read books set around early 1900s and Elms regularly get mentioned in descriptions of the countryside. A huge gap in the current landscape. ☹️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhitacreBespoke @NewtonWildsmith 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Do you not have any work to go to? You’re forever off birding!! 😂😂Fairburn, St Aidan’s, Blacktoft, Old Moor, Anglers, Duncombe......🙄👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SwaledaleBirds What are the chances of some tree experts (who no doubt have proper job titles) who could look at the DNA of these elms with a view to cloning disease-resistant elms? Elms are but a dim memory for people my age, sadly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fairburnjohng A licence to roam at will? Is this some mediaeval bylaw which has been kept a secret for centuries? I suppose he thinks it sounds better than, “I’m a crap dog owner. I can’t control my dog”. He’ll tell you he’s an animal lover, but actually couldn’t give a stuff about wildlife.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewtonWildsmith We have 2 -a white and a purple; the butterflies are happy with both. 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doctor_oxford Lost my cousin to this years ago, due to mis-diagnosis. Had early treatment myself 20 yrs ago. So pleased to see the vaccine is doing its job. Wish it had been around decades ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewtonWildsmith 2/2 And I read a 😂😂comment somewhere that Network Rail are the owners of the biggest Buddleia plantation on the planet. 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewtonWildsmith Agree. It’s a tremendously hardy shrub. I annually cut ours back to base and up they spring, full of blossom. Some folk don’t, as a)they don’t realise it can/should be done and b)what to do with the prunings in a city? But the butterflies etc love them whatever state they’re in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Emmabarnett My OH is with you on that one. I'm undecided, so we're a dog-free household. No doggy responsibilities or constraints on where we travel. 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder As you must regularly sing to your patient and resigned Missus "If you don't know me by now......". Good luck with that one 😳😳🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UnderwaterMedia @StevieD131 @BBCLookNorth @lillyspickup @PaulRTempoFM @plasticoceansuk @Seasaver I don't envy you. I live near the river.

<|startoftext|>@kitchenwriter @leedsbirder And so it begins #Brexitshambles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simon_reeve @LeedsTownHall We’re in there somewhere, up in the gods. Fantastic evening - thank you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarlBovisNature I would report it to the Police. However, I think I’m right in saying that once the Police are involved (assuming they become involved), the matter is out of the school’s hands and they will leave punishment or whatever to the Police. You need a meeting with the Head of Year asap<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simon_reeve<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simon_reeve @LeedsTownHall Thanks for a fascinating talk, Simon. Utterly inspirational on all counts.

<|startoftext|>@UB5simon @jonnybirder @LBC This is a genuine question from a non-Londoner. While Boris was Mayor, did he make any positive differences to the life of London’s residents?  And if he didn’t, why do people think he’d make an effective PM?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jessphillips And there really should be a semi-colon between the two ‘you’s. Any Y6 pupil could tell him that. Apart from that, I really don’t know how you put up with this level of inanity being levelled at you. It’s mindless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning House near us up for sale with a lovely Rowan at bottom of garden. All sorts feed on it. Suspect new owners will decide it's blocking the view. Am keeping an eye on situation and may have to ask them to "wait and see" before doing anything drastic 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@campbellclaret And these are the people who are being pandered to by MPs. Some awful scenes of intimidation last night. #BrexitShambles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@snowmantambo If you don't follow @ChrisMasonBBC then do so. He's your only hope. Though at times, he does admit to 'not having a foggiest' and suggesting that Mr Blobby (ask your Dad) has more of an idea........😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mark_vulture @martinRSPB @BirdLife_SA @BirdLife_CEO @BirdLife_News @plessis_morne @WWFSouthAfrica Ha.

<|startoftext|>@grangranwalker Assembled food in the main. Quick and easy with no leftovers at the end of the day. A very different style of offerings, with very few cooking skills required.  And not a lot of sandwich choice, considering what most eateries can offer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hilarybennmp Thank you from one Hilary to another more important one. Could you please persuade your leader to do likewise??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Fortunately, it seems to have hung around a certain area; we thought we’d be unlucky, but it appeared right in front of us, perched on a dead tree. A lovely bird. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Welcome back!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>GGS in Dalby Forest showing quite well late morning. I won't post my mediocre record shots - far better pics already on Twitter!  Many thanks to @jgsigsworth for his brilliant directions 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@snowmantambo @BotRevoke Have done 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@snowmantambo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@snowmantambo Three and a half million last time I looked 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Still well behind you, but going for the GGS tomorrow at Dalby 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@snowmantambo Our neighbours will be there too. Sadly we are otherwise engaged but there in spirit. Trust you've signed the petition. 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning I'm with you. Get confused between that causeway and the path by Astley.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wildwood_photos Is this netting malarkey a recent phenomenon? It's a very cynical and duplicitous way of getting around regulations. It needs knocking on the head ASAP. Just because an estate of houses is being built doesn't mean existing trees/hedges should be at risk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wildwood_photos So in other words, that hedgerow is destined for the chop, sadly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning The oil tank end?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StonesGary @Barnsleybsg Called in yesterday afternoon and had the place to ourselves. Calm and quiet. 3 Hares browsing far side of “lake” but I failed to find the #Shelduck. Another visit, methinks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ByDonkeys Farage currently spouting on R4 Today saying he will take over as leader of the Brexit party i.e. ukip. And that it doesn't matter how many are on the March as 20 million are on it in spirit. And that no-deal will be fantastic. I despair. 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Right. Get back to Calais or Boulogne and we'll get you a rowing boat from somewhere.....😱😱😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now stands at nearly 2 and a half million.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@archignat Thanks. An interesting read, but it helps if you get a really clear photo, trap one or hear it! When you do none of these, it's more over a challenge 🙄🙄😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Where did you find the Redpoll?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanDunt I just find it incredibly sad that Speaker Bercow should find it necessary to speak as he did. Our Parliament is just a disgraceful embarrassment at times. It fills me with despair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fairburnjohng Well, put it this way, John. Compared to me, you certainly are an expert. Current opinion is 3-0 Marsh Tit. I'll try for a better shot next time, hoping there is a next time! 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoutledgeSteve That's 2-0 then. #MallowTit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WildlifeInWakey Thanks. It was there while we were on holiday as daughter had sent me a friend's pic of it. I couldn't see it, but it could've been on the island out of sight. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not the best photo but the best I could do. Willow or Marsh? On feeder (obvs) in garden near Kirkbymoorside N Yorks.  https://t.co/gM1zmagPNf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WildlifeInWakey Is that Mandarin still around at Thornes? I went looking for it the other day and failed 🙄. Still find it a bit weird that there’s an aviary in the park.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KittiwakesTyne Thanks. I'll have  a read. So many #netting problems at the moment, either on buildings or hedges. And there's always a better, kinder solution. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KittiwakesTyne Netting free?? #Tyne<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First #Peacock butterfly of the year, enjoying the sun #Pugneys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RSPB_OldMoor Thank you. 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RSPB_OldMoor That’s all well and good, but can we have some confirmation as to what the new “offer” will be? Sandwiches, crisps and pre-packed cake as the new chiller suggests, or will there also be some proper hot food?  Just asking for several friends as well as me. 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mel_rowell @JoKingDevon Tend to agree. And there's so many unused and derelict buildings- factories and office blocks- which could be cleared for the land. Like the one near Wakey Double2 bridge. Can see it from our house. Empty for years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoKingDevon @mel_rowell I think I'd prefer a law to prevent Building Developers from grubbing up hedgerows, which is what I assume they end up doing post-netting. 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ByDonkeys @Nigel_Farage Local BBC News showed the March but no mention was made of numbers, or lack of.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jgsigsworth On this occasion, let’s assume I’ll pay the money.......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jgsigsworth Hoping to find the GGS at Dalby this weekend but not a clue where to start looking. Could you poss DM me some directions please Graham? It appears to be pretty site-specific?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley Came down the chimney or just curious visitors via an open window?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley ??? Why have you got Kitchen Jackdaws??😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#WillowTit feeding on mesh feeder behind new Reserve fence, back of #Pugneys 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning There was a Chiffie in the hedgerow by the non-tarmac path running next to the beck, top of Pugneys, day before yesterday.  Very vocal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PcAndyLong I'm not being funny, as I realise this is a seriously dangerous thing to do (and I wouldn't have done it), but how should he have dealt with it? Rung the AA? Contacted a Highway Patrol to close the carriageway? What did you suggest could've been done. #Scary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sneezysnooze @AnnielizzieSten @Kateblincoe @M_Z_Harrison @Tesco We were in a cafe bar in Kefalonia 2 yrs ago. The #Swallows were nesting inside the open-fronted building. People just ducked and watched the proceedings. Better than TV. Owner had cleared the area below the nests and worked round them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>⁦@YoloBirder⁩ Going through some old photos and came across this. Thought it might benefit from a caption, but I'm struggling for ideas 🙄🙄🤔  https://t.co/M9pBQfRBpV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PurpleChick820 Do you follow the wonderful @jeanthorpeRR ? She rehabilitates injured birds and other wildlife in Norton (Malton) NYorkshire. She sounds like your sort of woman. She's a miracle worker 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Natures_Voice Re #Tesco. @vivconnett suggested an in-store webcam to which I replied.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Natures_Voice @Tesco Thank you. As I've said else-thread, they could turn this into a win-win, positive publicity-all-round story. They just need someone with a bit of imagination and the authority to do it. Good luck! 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Long time since I watched any- but 25 yrs ago we used to sing the alternative words to Postman Pat who ran over his caaaaaat 😱😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PurpleChick820 Thanks. We have had our own major "disagreements" here in Yorkshire with YWT over building a Visitors Centre at Spurn. You may have come across that 😳😩so I know they have their "failings".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Natures_Voice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PurpleChick820 I’m not a Norfolk local. I was using an example of a possible organisation, not a specific one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 We were just saying this afternoon that you’ve been a bit quiet lately! Enjoy that amazing island.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vivconnett @birdersagainst @Tesco I'm sure a local group would happily supply. And both them, the birds, Tesco manager and a bunch of smiley kids would be on the front of the local paper, on local news.... a win win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1969Dalyboy @Kateblincoe @M_Z_Harrison 2/2. Use it as an opportunity to put the store in the news for a Good Reason instead of causing a Twitter storm. I hope you get a favourable response to yr request. Most people are reasonable IF they have it explained WHY a change has happened. Not 🚀science! 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1969Dalyboy @Kateblincoe @M_Z_Harrison I despair at the kneejerk reactions such as this Tesco. Manager terrified of Elf n Safety, that bird poo on the trolleys = major outrage by customers. It's as if there is no other way forward. Like hotels/pubs netting against Kittiwake. Just think laterally🙄1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kateblincoe @M_Z_Harrison Just think how differently this could've been done. Moved the trolleys and invited local Wildlife Trust to produce an information point, educating the shoppers as to why. A few would moan, but most people are interested in #Swallows when you talk about their migrations. 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kateblincoe @ChrisGPackham @HighAshFarm @M_Z_Harrison @nicolawriting @patrick_barkham Compare to city centre #Catania in Sicily. We were there last Spring and the air was alive with thousands and thousands of #Swifts, nesting in the baroque eaves. I've never seen so many. And was anyone bothered? No. #UrbanBirds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder @vizcomic Just don't put it in the dishwasher 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbclaurak Aaargh, Laura. We have tried to follow this Omnishambles as best we can and are failing. How on earth you are retaining your sanity is anybody's guess 😱😱#BrexitMayhem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarristerSecret Better not put them in the dishwasher then 😳🙄And I don’t exactly think that the importers of illegal machetes, swords, flick knives and so on would comply.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Steady on Jeremy. What with revelations about you planting hedges on your farm etc, people will begin to think you’re a decent human being! Seriously, any advert for doing a #2minutebeachclean is most welcome, whether in the UK or not. Every little helps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2minbeachclean<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCLookNorth It might have been better if you’d used a different word than “support”. I think it gives an erroneous impression of what is probably actually happening. This is not normal 8 year-old behaviour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Markthebirder Err, I’ll have to explain what a #Sanderling is to start with; no doubt there’s a YouTube clip of one out there to show them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsdavegreen @borobarrister And the fact that the Court System can’t cope is not one that is being reported. “We” would just assume, naively, that a hearing on a specific date would go ahead, not be postponed due to a lack of judiciary. What else isn’t being reported??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Markthebirder Oooh. A nice bit of #alliteration there. I think I’ll keep that one for when I revise it with the Y6s before their SATs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsdavegreen @borobarrister I have nothing to do with the judiciary. This sort of thing never comes to the notice of Joe Public as it’s not reported in the media. Unless you are “in the system” in one way or another, these scandalous statistics are “kept secret”. It’s revelations on Twitter that inform us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesMelville Please don't think that all "expats" are the same. Friends moved there 12 yrs ago to rural village. Integrated. Learnt Spanish, now fluent. Play full part in village life. V worried indeed by #Brexit and it's uncertainty. V stressed by their position. Feel very worried for them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave Ooer Missus. Nothing like a good seeing to by an electrician. So they say 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave Let us know when you move in and I’ll drop in for a cuppa when I come to Bempton/Flamborough. Has your electrician sorted your ring out yet?? 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dlsmithies Or it could be Jennifer Saunders playing a part....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WorcsBirding @TaylorWimpey @WorcsWT @worcscc @RSPBMidlands @DaveThroupEA @Hedgehogfriend3 @ChrisGPackham @MalvernHills_DC @EnvAgency @WestMidBirdClub I’d have thought that a proper #hedge would’ve cut down on noise from the road, and air pollution. And been a nicer view than passing vehicles. Barking decision by @TaylorWimpey.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boldboblet @RSPB_OldMoor Sounds as if it’s to be like Bempton cafe. Where the serving staff are not allowed to put the pots of soup into the microwave so you have to microwave your own. Soup and prepackaged sarnies with the added bag of crisps, and prepackaged biscuity cake things. A backward step IMHO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OilyMuggie @djhenshall @FI_Obs @AnnCleeves Thank you for that. Good to know. 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@djhenshall @FI_Obs Well. I’d been hoping to ‘do’ Shetland and Fair Isle this year and had hoped to visit the famous Obs. I’d be happy to contribute to a crowd-funder. Do we know if anyone is thinking of setting one up? @AnnCleeves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnnCleeves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 @HorburyBridgeAc 🤗🤗🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SurreyAmps @simmonite_dave Rather on the lines of a kid I taught. "I hate the Spanish" 'Why??' "Cos last year I was in Spain and one of them trod on my foot. I hate them." I did try and get him to see etc etc but a lost battle. He'll be of voting age now 😩😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nomadbirder @jonnybirder As someone said, and this applies to me, I know enough about birds to realise that I know very little. I'd see a "rare" and think, well it couldn't be an X ..... 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fisermanian Where the BTGodwit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HorburyBridgeAc Congratulations to the amazing @sarahjolly1 for her #Macmillan dinner last night. Fantastic food. Thanks as well to Mrs Stearne for her auction contributions 😱😱Great fun and laughs all round. A lovely evening. 👍👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevieD131 @Wintersett1 @CroftonBirder @Fitzybirder @grayspeight @BeckyBailey101 @Barnsleybsg Always a welcome sight. One of my favourite birds. Their call is other-worldly #Curlew<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CrimeLineLaw @borobarrister Is this down to lack of "manpower" or incompetence?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BiologistDan @simmonite_dave I was always of the opinion that Oregon was a Liberal state. Obviously I've been wrong. This is sickeningly sad. As ever, the Gun Lobby seem to get laws passed that other countries would not give the time of day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@transenv @EU_Commission @TimmermansEU @MAC_europa @MalmstromEU Friends told me that they never buy anything with #PalmOil in it. I said that that was nigh on impossible these days as it was everywhere, sadly. I didn't realise it was used for bio-fuel. I'd really prefer it if it wasn't. Other less harmful sources MUST be available, surely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave @LeagueScotland @RaptorPersScot @claudiabeamish @ReviveCoalition @scottishlabour 😂😂🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bikerjaney @wickedauntjane @simmonite_dave @RSPB_OldMoor @Barnsleybsg Well that's a real shame. A lot of non- birders eat there as a "drop-in" cafe. Compare to Potteric Carr which has a seriously good cafe and also attracts local office workers etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bucktonbirder @wickedauntjane @simmonite_dave @RSPB_OldMoor @Barnsleybsg Whatever happens, I’m hoping the food will still be cooked/prepared on the premises. And please bring back teapots (my endless plea). You can’t get a proper cuppa from a teabag in a mug. I’d pay extra quite happily for a decent cup of tea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YorkshireProse  https://t.co/o9Flzg8bwb One for you, if it hasn’t reached you already. Love the names people give to what we call the “Bizarre Bazar”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wickedauntjane @simmonite_dave @RSPB_OldMoor @Barnsleybsg I understood from their tweet that it would be closed for 10 days for a deep clean and refurb. What am I missing here??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>. #CostaRica Feb 2019. Well at least we saw one. #ResplendentQuetzal. Not an easy bird to fit into your camera lens from top to bottom 😳😳  https://t.co/0jiNfSEEDI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder Driving rain. Anything vaguely sensible is tucked well out of sight 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeicsPoliceRPU @leicspolice The multi coloured elastic bands rather give it the look of an art work. Maybe that's what the driver will tell you 🙄😂Good job!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheVideator @Barnsleybsg OH says to get thissen dahn to local scrappie. It'll be theear. Or at least I think that's what he said. 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @mel_rowell @RSPBAireValley Haha! I often forget to call in there. Several years ago, there was a rather tame Water rail mooching about the reedbed in full view of the duck feeding visitors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesTCobbler @borobarrister You'd never believe they are the same person. Well done to the Timpson "family" and every best wish to Roger. Keep up the fantastic work. 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cm_bagot @AnnCleeves I think it's often the parents conducting the background interview .....🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StansaidAirport @mgfkingslynn 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StansaidAirport @mgfkingslynn You’re not wrong there! And when you’re held captive for best part of 4 hours, it’s a case of pay up or starve!! Just get rid of those dollars, cos you’ll lose a shed-load in commission if you take them back. Only way to think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StansaidAirport @mgfkingslynn Ha. San Jose, Costa Rica. $5 US for a pain au chocolat, $10 US for a very average panini. And don’t get me started on the price of water or soft drinks. Crazy 😳😳Makes @StansaidAirport seem rather restrained, price-wise!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomCadwallender It was sad last night on local news - piece about young men being stabbed. Mum gave little daughter a helium balloon to release that would “go to Heaven so Daddy can see it”. Just very wrong messages all round there. Plant a tree in his name instead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder @TomCadwallender OH has found ashes urns at the top of several Lake District fells - ashes scattered &amp; plastic box/urn dropped and left. 😩I’m happy with leaving flowers that have been unwrapped and which will eventually wither &amp; break up, but to leave them in plastic wrapping ..😡Think, people!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeWantPlates @rosewal If this is in the U.K., I wonder what Food Standards would have to say. Barking 😩🙄😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.On #worldbookday19 my much loved elderly #Kindle has died. 😩😩 Can't live without one these days, so to Leeds tomorrow for a replacement 🙄👍  https://t.co/vcqqIZCQ7z<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnnCleeves @BrendaBlethyn @MauraWilding @kennydoughty I trust those clothes are all from charity shops! #Vera seems to rely on them for her coats at least 😳Good choice!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 Yes thanks. Your original only appeared this morning after I'd sent a reminder 🙄🙄Now have both!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 Don't forget to DM me your details!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WYP_RPU @jo_beekers Do you play "Pull-Over Bingo"? You pull a car over and then get a 'win' for every infringement? That must be a full house, surely? 😳😳👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Winnfrith1 @jayrayner1 Indeed. There is a farm shop up here in Yorkshire selling pork. The sign says "We sell owt bar t'squeak". ie The whole animal apart from its grunt. Which is how it should be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elisemalpais Yes, we collected lone flip-flops!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Butterfly_bros @JimAshton_ @Natures_Voice There is a short privet hedge next to a terrace of housing in a quiet backstreet in central Wakefield. Someone puts down loads of seed on the pavement every day. The hedge is rammed with sparrows. QED.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BiologistDan Experienced #PalmOil plantations first hand last week in #CostaRica. Massive areas of monoculture but highly profitable sadly. This #OrangUtan story should be broadcast by every media outlet to make public aware of the consequences of cheap food.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fairburnjohng Known as Flying Lollipops in our house. Love 'em. #LongTailTits<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elisemalpais @2minbeachclean Virtually all our #BeachClean plastic had been washed up, with straws, bottle lids and fishing line the most numerous items. #CostaRica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnnCleeves @RachycCharter My husband tells me that #Vera is my sartorial role model 🙄She can’t be, as although I have her hat, I’m missing a charity shop raincoat. Pleased to see she’s had a bit of a new haircut recently. 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>⁦@2minbeachclean⁩ Suggested to our group that they did a clean-up on our remote beach near Drakes Bay #CostaRica. First sweep...  https://t.co/XS5VFEXzo7<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wildlifeimages Hi Steve. Struggling to reach Richard B to let him know I've booked 2 (not 1) places for Whales and Seabirds Sept 7. (One a gift voucher) Emails keep bouncing back. Not in UK for 2 weeks so worried I'll lose second place. Can you help? 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlsBoy 😩😩😩😱😱😱😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OscarRomeo1268 @NYorksRPG @NypAnpr @NYPFirearmsUnit @NYPDogSection Amazing how often the offences mount up - rarely just the one for you to deal with. Result 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisGPackham I'm in 2 minds about this. Some students will join in organised events which is fine. Good political practical education . Others will simply go home which isn't fine. Many parents won't know what their kids are up to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CatrinNye My name being Hilary (one L) my husband delights in giving our names as Bill and Hillary. The baristas never get the reference, sadly. Still, it amuses him 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martinroper5462 @RSPBAireValley @Natures_Voice Yes I saw it last week but my photos on my bridge camera (windy too) don't compare. Was only kidding!! Fantastic little bird.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martinroper5462 @RSPBAireValley @Natures_Voice Gosh. Could you not have got it any closer?? 🙄😂👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wilgils 🙄🙄Pathetic.  They should be prepared to enter into debate etc with people who may disagree with them, not metaphorically stick their fingers in their ears and sing Lalala.  Another reason why I’m no longer prepared to give them my money #YWT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley Maybe your lad might know. It's obviously one of those jobs my ex-colleague Head was referring to when he told the kids that many would end up in jobs not yet invented.  I came across a "Cheese Influencer" the other day. No, me neither.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley Oh, that answers that one then. I did wonder how I, retired MFL teacher, might have links to a Bitcoin miner. Ummmm- what IS a Bitcoin miner??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OscarRomeo1268 The number of times we've followed caravans up #SuttonBank 🙄despite the warning signs and alt route. Maybe HGVs need an alt route too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RuthTingay And for those out of the loop, does he have a name? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley. Am on LinkedIn for no good reason. You I recognise. Him, however! I don't even understand what those words mean. Why should I know him?? #Algorhythms 🙄😩  https://t.co/5W7KMJaFOT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnnCleeves We’re rather spoiled, Ann. First a series of Vera (my fashion inspiration according to my husband) followed by Shetland. Trust there’s another book (either will do!) on the way. Thank you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RSPBAireValley @RSPB_N_England Rather in 2 minds about this. There is plenty of opportunity for this already at your sister site, Fairburn Ings - pond dipping, play area etc. I’d rather money were spent on a hide or 2 for your regular visitors.  But maybe we oldies aren’t the target audience. 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScreenjabberStu @jayrayner1 @YodelOnline Sadly, all too often, you don't get to choose. The sender decides and you take the consequences. I use Royal Mail whenever possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hudsonweather @looknorthBBC @peter_levy Take your pick between Ugglebarnby and The Land of Nod. Two of my favourite place names.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirdwatchExtra That is indeed a vast amount of money if it is actually just for one hide and one "Bittern Information Point". Someone is seriously taking the mickey if that is the case. I'm sure RSPB could provide much more for the same cash 😳😳🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FairburnBirder1 @RSPBAireValley @MyWakefield @SelbyDC Just the one? There were several dropped on the verge/chucked in the bushes when I walked from the oil depot, along the lane towards the river bridge. So depressing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TC1881_NYP @RyedalePolice @NYorksRPG As someone who regularly uses the A169, I thank you for that. It’s not a road to mess with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stooooman Thanks Stuart. A job for this evening then after I've made a banana and walnut loaf. No doubt too much choice!! 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StansaidAirport As in 'Can you guess which it is?' 😩😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stooooman Thank you. Can you recommend any? I'm not a user of the things normally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now then Twits. I listen a lot to audiobooks via my iPad. However there's no headphone access. Are there any wireless headphones out there that would allow me to do so on a plane? I'm not a gadget geek so any recommendations welcome. 🤔🤔🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPD_UK Morning. Can I just ask- what is the point of my giving specific instructions on where to leave my parcel (safe place) if the driver ignores them and delivers to a neighbour instead?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nazirafzal If nothing else transpires, the debate about elderly drivers needs airing. I faced great difficulty persuading my patently incapable Dad (88) to stop and his GP refused to help. All about independence.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NicolaHanrahan Looks like a rather nice hellebore and a Brenda Troyle named snowdrop. Looking good! 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlsBoy Hhhmmmmm. Same talking cat, same bear, same Sandra. Curious coincidence 🙄😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adriawildlife @BirdGuides I was there in June last year. Amazing place!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andyhislop1 Deep respect to you, young man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andyhislop1 @wanderlustwm @CBTHunting @rocketrod208 Good job you've got a big sofa!! You've got to love a rescue greyhound 👍❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicolaHanrahan Are these yours, Nikki? If so, very different to your usual style. 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andyhislop1 @wanderlustwm @CBTHunting @rocketrod208 Our friends in rural Spain took in a pointer, turfed out this way. She was in a shocking condition. Spanish hunting dogs are working dogs, not pets, and are viewed as expendable, not as friends. Villagers think they’re v strange for having the dog IN the house.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBTHunting Friends in deepest Spain took in a young pointer in a dreadful condition. She’s afraid of loud noises so her hunting owners turfed her out. Turned up at friends’ door, they fed her, paid for vet. She’s  been with them for 11 yrs now 👍👍Lucky Lucy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProfBrianCox 😂😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Where best to park? Going walking up round there Friday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fisermanian Where to head for, Ian? River or Wetland etc?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicolaHanrahan Bleppy. There’s a new word on me, Nikki. And don’t do your talents down - compared to 99.9% of the rest of us, who can’t draw/paint/design as well as you, you’re an inspiration. 🤗🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiploMog No use licking your lips, Palmerston- it's not edible 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rdh_rob @birderpete @clevelandbirds Looks like a mix of Blackbird and Redwing 😂😂It would have had me puzzled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can someone please tell me what "Vehicle Remarketing" is?  Is it just another way of saying "Second Hand Cars?" 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Well done you. I'm trailing on 87 after today's Barn Owl. Failed to find the Scoter yesterday 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Saw it on my way back from Aldi. Will have to start taking camera as well as binns shopping with me 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Barn Owl Castle Farm #Pugneys 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A rather different side to the contentious #JeremyClarkson  https://t.co/pACaC4gG7r<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @wakeyweir86 @WakeyBirders This is the Scoter I'm talking about. Not the fly-tipped TV 🙄🙄😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahjolly1 @HorburyBridgeAc @lizstearne Thanks Sarah 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HorburyBridgeAc  FAO Liz Stearne.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheVideator @Barnsleybsg I went to OM at midday and had the place to myself 🙄🙄I had hoped for a #Brambling on the feeders, but no joy. Now I know why. They’re all elsewhere. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Recordshotmyars Truly, embarrassingly, terrible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @wakeyweir86 @WakeyBirders Hopefully will be there tomorrow, Alex. I’ve just picked this up and it’s dark out there! No chance of a tick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuzieqnessCo1 Well yes! Rules are there to be broken! That's the general guide (which is why guide has a u in it ) 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuzieqnessCo1 G+A, O or U is a hard G.   G + E or I is a soft G.  Works in French too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayrayner1 We had a practice No-Deal Brexit supper the other night. Jacket potatoes (British) stuffed with onions (from garden) and corned beef (tinned, not EU, could be stockpiled) topped with Cheddar (UK) with mushy peas (British, likewise).  🙄🙄You have to laugh ......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fairburnjohng Saw the amazingly confiding #Beardies this aft. #StAidans Couldn’t believe how unphased they were by humans &amp; motor drives. Managed a few slightly-better-than-record-shots with my little camera, none worth posting! What a privilege to see them so close 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WildlifeInWakey @Xercise4Less @sainsburys Called in earlier and managed to see one only. Loads of Redwing etc. Still lots of berries left! #Waxwings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrittonatMarske @nybirdnews @Bucktonbirder @clevelandbirds Thank you. I have a pic of my own which I'll 'revisit'. I know the #Pugneys birds are Willows- often v vocal - but this one was on a N Yorks feeder. If necessary I'll post it on here 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nybirdnews @Bucktonbirder @clevelandbirds Cutting edge?? 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bucktonbirder @nybirdnews @clevelandbirds What's the giveaway clue? I'm hopeless at IDing Marsh and Willow Tits 🙄🙄😩#MallowTits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @fairburnjohng I'll borrow husband's Big Coat. Mine is warm, but his has been to the summit of Mont Blanc so it's super toastie. I'm sure he can do without for the afternoon 😳😩😂Not bothered it makes me look at little "MichelinMan". Comfort over style !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning In our own little way, we have Oddball and the Little Owls and Kestrels at St. Aidan's. Wildlife finding a home in an industrial landscape.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fairburnjohng Thanks for that, John. Hoping to go tomorrow......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Eye-opening little film on #Winterwatch about industrial #Teeside and its amazing wildlife. Well worth catching up if you missed it. If you’ve not visited, just do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisMasonBBC Called in to see a friend today who runs an independent DIY warehouse. He showed me his #Brexit file of letters from virtually ALL his suppliers, warning him of forthcoming price rises.  Marvellous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Some of the Canadas at Old Moor have very ruddy heads, caused by the same thing apparently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mel_rowell @mhemingway25 Usually call in to look at the book and for a heads up. Always helpful. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Bearing in mind the size of St Aidan's, where to head to for the Beardie?? And is the Whooper at Lindyke?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayrayner1 In our house, we don't know why he's walking around free. He should've been exiled to a remote island in the Atlantic. St Helena springs to mind  😡😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RogerQuimbly @borobarrister Which is basically what the older gentleman (?) said on BBC News @10 re poss food shortages. Fake News, Scaremongering and anyway it'll do us all good to go without for a while. Gobsmacking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave @PatHeath2 @Barnsleybsg @HuntSabs @syptweet @MoorlandMonitor @LeagueACS @PeakChief @peakdistrict @YorkshireWater Thank you!! I was wondering ... 😳😂👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wendyredrobin @RSPBAireValley Wendy-I'd be more than happy to have ANY Bearded Tit photos, full stop 😳😳🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatHeath2 @Barnsleybsg @HuntSabs @syptweet @MoorlandMonitor @LeagueACS @PeakChief @peakdistrict @YorkshireWater Um - North America? Autocorrect or am I missing something here?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder I’m wondering if she’s wondering if you’re ever going to get back to Yorkshire after your Mallorca holiday, or if you’ll be camping at the airport for weeks...... #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieRenison I spoke to a young(ish) woman last week who proudly told me she neither listened to, watched, or read The News. She wasn’t interested &amp; didn’t even know what Brexit meant. Or cared. So maybe Tariffs is just News Shorthand for all the stuff that will go wrong at “The Border”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikegalsworthy @BBCr4today He may well be a backbencher, but I'm always uneasy when he's 'quiet'. Wonder what he's plotting 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewLucas103 @BirdTrack @welshbirders I'll send you all of them from West Yorkshire. Common as proverbial. What can you swap?? 🤔🙄😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Recordshotmyars Come up to Wakefield and we’ll show you what “poor light” really looks like, Mr Photographer. Waxwings in the gloom. Didn’t even bother getting my camera out. 🙄🙄😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder @OFOCBrexit @Femi_Sorry OMG. I utterly, utterly despair. Just stick head in metaphorical sand, fingers in ears and sing Lalala. That’s the way to do it, apparently. We’ll rebuild (😳😳) and continue as normal. Unbe-bloody-lievable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Well if you will choose a windy morning!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder 😳😳🙄😩There'll be 40 of the buggers next year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave We saw one briefly the other late afternoon at #Pugneys. We were inspecting the Iceland and Glauc gulls, when the Bittern flew across low, infront of us. Even seeing one is a privilege, especially at Pugneys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave And are you monitoring #Bitterns again this year? The Lovely Gerald told me you'd spent 72 (?) days monitoring last year. That's commitment 😳👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RuthLee143 @ChrisGPackham Yes, we were watching it. That’s the problem with palm oil. Very versatile, very profitable, in so many varied products that it’s very difficult to avoid. “Big Palm Oil” certainly have turned the screws in too many countries. Quite frightening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave You mean “the lovely Gerald”. I’ve not seen him this year yet, as I’ve not managed to get to OM. I’ll try for next week, weather willing. 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisGPackham Sri Lanka, I understand, have replaced unprofitable rubber plantations with palm (oil) trees but have not allowed virgin forest/jungle to be used for this purpose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave I think you could argue either way, Mr Simmonite. As for the bottom of the barrel, this excuse sounds like it's way beyond that.  #pedant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder According to Radio4, you can count Red Kite as a flyover. Our friends in Stokenchurch off M40 have dozens over their garden every day.  You (well, not you) can stand at their bedroom window and the Kites just glide by at eye level. Ridiculous. 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning 👍👍😀Where were they?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder Nuthatch on peanuts. Only second sighting in 3 years 😳😳👍#Marton #BigGardenBirdWatch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @WildlifeInWakey @Xercise4Less @sainsburys They were seen flying to the other side of the railway line late afternoon yesterday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder They cost me a fortune in bird seed - there’s usually around 20 - but it’s worth every single penny. #TreeSparrows<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder Ooh. Currently have 5 TSs on the feeder here in #Marton #NorthYorkshire.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Just_Clive Roles. Not holes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @RSPBAireValley Dare I say better than Waxwings!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bucktonbirder 🙄🙄😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning They were right at the top of the tree in Sainsbury's side car park by the pelican crossing. Then flitting across into rowan outside gym with Redwing n Blackbirds. No light so mainly silhouettes. Worth a go tomorrow?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Not exactly good light either. No doubt you've got previous Waxwing photos taken against a blue sky. Good to see them in Wakey though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 I trust you got pics. Poor light though 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WildlifeInWakey @CudworthMick @WaxwingsUK Loads of berries on tree outside gym. They keep flitting across. Redwing, Mistle n Blackbirds too 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CudworthMick @WildlifeInWakey @WaxwingsUK Still in Sainsbury's side carpark  10:45<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CudworthMick @WildlifeInWakey @WaxwingsUK I suspect so. I don’t think big Sainsbury’s has trees?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WildlifeInWakey @WaxwingsUK I’ll be going to Horbury via the town centre then......  😳😳#WakeyWaxwings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FollowingFX @TC1881_NYP @NYorksRPG Really? If I read this right, she was being driven with a baby sitting on her knee, not in a baby seat where it should have been. I suspect she was happily complicit in the bloke’s behaviour, sadly. I hope Police gave her a severe bollocking at the very least (technical term!)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StansaidAirport Ooooh, you are awful. But I like you. As someone once said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeWantPlates @MarinaOLoughlin How the Hell do they clean Marmite remains off a wooden board? If they can’t, then a) it’s unhygienic and b) the board will be impregnated with it for evermore. Just spoon some into a chic little pot and be done with it. I blame #Masterchef for these trendy smears.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wilgils @jonnie_fisk None taken! Just didn't want to be responsible for Fake News 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wilgils @jonnie_fisk I shall delete tweet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayrayner1 Some very interesting forensic auditing to come, I imagine. #PatisserieValerie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StansaidAirport Badge of honour, mate. Badge of honour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder Kia Co'ot surely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nadiafo68846427 @YoloBirder If if wasn't, it is now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dannyfardell1 @simmonite_dave I didn't dare ask for fear of her response. I do wonder at times why the Pankhursts et al bothered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clevelandbirds If you use BTO BirdTrack and search the map for e.g. Red Kite, none are shown, for the birds' protection. Good enough argument for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisMasonBBC Hmm. Nearest one to us in in Leeds, apart from supplying Sainsbury's. As long as Bettys continues to trade in Yorkshire , we'll be fine. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dannyfardell1 @simmonite_dave And the sad thing is, she seemed rather proud of telling me she was happily clueless. No doubt when it hits her in a bad way, she'll have someone else to blame. 🙄😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that was depressing. Joked with youngish woman shelf-stacker in supermarket about empty shelves- was this a pic of no-deal Brexit. She happily informed me she neither knew nor cared what 'Brexit' even means, doesn't watch the news and isn't bothered. Marvellous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisMasonBBC @Telegraph Matt's skill has always been in deftly combining 2 unrelated threads. Brilliant. 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevieD131 I've done that. I'll see what happens, but the answer seems to be not much. I'll check it against my iPad feed, but they are usually never the same 🙄😳🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevieD131 Twitter of the phone!?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmm - my Twitter feed won't update. Notifications arriving but tweets the same as 24 hours ago. It's knickers seem to be in a twist. Any advice??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlsBoy I seriously imagine that he was intensely embarrassed by that. Utterly ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder A question on University Challenge this evening - I paraphrase here - highly persecuted raptor and a link to Northern Grouse Moors.  Answer Hen Harrier.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mancunianmedic Aha. First 20 mins free. We didn't pay a penny!! #thwarted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mancunianmedic 2 weeks ago, OH sent to hospital by GP for chest X-ray. From getting carpark ticket to getting back in car, less than 20minutes. Unbelievable!! #NHS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mancunianmedic Indeed. I found everyone who dealt with me made sure everything was crystal clear. 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mancunianmedic Can I say that I recently had a minor op in hospital and not one of the team, from the surgeon to the lovely lady who brought me a recovery cuppa, used any of these. Could it just be a Management problem?? 😳😳😩🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AskhamJohn @jonnybirder Sorry, can't help but don't be embarrassed at all. Do whatever it takes. Good luck to you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cdeblock @StansaidAirport Im not disputing that, just the fact that 37% of the people isn't The People, which implies a concensus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@exitthelemming Utterly terrifying. What an army.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fairburnjohng Advice. Only buy black socks, ever. Problem solved. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StansaidAirport No, Teresa. The people did not vote to Leave. 37% of the electorate did so. That's not 'The People' 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder @csdriver Any help for mobile users🤔🤔?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hudsonweather Sorry. Is it April 1st already?? 😩🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whitfieldbenson @fairburnjohng A man after my own gustatory habits!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fairburnjohng Jam before clotted cream, surely?? 😳😳 The answer, obviously, being jam first then cream. Strawberry jam at that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hudsonweather And then can we do Scowns or Scons please?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirdwatchExtra Probably not, because milk is now homogenised and the cream on full fat milk is incorporated within the milk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hudsonweather We were in Kent many years ago and asked for Scraps on our f&amp;c. The man looked at us in disgust and told us scraps were what he gave the cat. It was Bits we wanted. 🙄😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Assume you mean #BrexitChaos      Basically the government of this country has ground to a halt. No time for the stuff needed to be done for the good of the people. It's frightening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarolineLucas A second, informed referendum, now we know the facts and implications. And no No Deal at all costs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley  One for you, maybe? Mushroom magic: why the latest health fad might be on to something  https://t.co/E3GyT6luQI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PalmerstonFOCat Any of the above apart from the last one. It feels as if the country is already bubbling under in places. Maybe “It’s a Parliamentary Knockout” would be a better idea 😳😳#BrexitShambles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlsBoy Thank you for keeping us giggling is these rather uncertain times. More please. Then more more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlsBoy And even then, they were told, “Ha ha, very funny, but no it’s not gonna happen. Now go away and we’ll come up with something more sensible.” #Boaty #BrexitChaos<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FellowMarkW My late parents were terrified into paying up £200 to get rid of 3 men who 'offered' to mend damage to the garage roof that they had caused.

<|startoftext|>@PaulieTandoori We currently claim no benefits as we are not entitled to any, either of us. I'm seriously confused here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulieTandoori I’m very confused. OH and I both have work pensions from teaching. He receives State Pension. I am younger than him but am caught in the ‘age trap’ for a couple of more years.  We claim no benefits. Do I assume we are not affected here?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarristerSecret I’m struggling to imagine the Queen doing something similar if he graces us with his presence again.  #McDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@glaisdale1001 I thought it was. We stayed there several years ago for the novelty of being Milburns in the Milburn Arms. It's a pity that it remains closed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glaisdale1001 Is it David Ross who owns the closed Milburn Arms? We regularly visit the NYMoors and rarely see much beyond sheep, sheep, sheep and the odd grouse. On the surface, it seems to be pretty much a desert.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 We spent an interesting time in the Reserve hide yesterday, watching what I assume wasn't this bird, repeatedly dive bombing Coots and Pochard, and attacking an up-ended Swan's rear. Aggressive chap!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@birderpete @fisermanian The motorway end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmyGarciauk Hiya Amy. Re your starling murmuration - Twitchers are (usually) blokes who travel the length and breadth of the UK at short notice to “tick” a very rare bird. The rest of us are just Birders. We birders are the ones who appreciate a good murmuration!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ProbableBS Just tried that link and apparently you don’t exist 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulasykes1971 I was there when @jonnybirder flushed the Blyths. It was in a large ‘field’ of semi-industrial scrub, and had been popping up on occasions to perch on boulders. J walked the field slowly, the bird flew up &amp; hopped on to the raised edge of the scrub.  A lot of people left happy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@msabirder I judge myself an incompetent enthusiast. On my visits to Spurn, I do what I can myself, then ask a group of scope wielders 'what should I be looking for' and almost invariably I'm helped and guided. Only way to learn is bite the bullet and ask. #Spurn<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ridingtheroaduk @jayrayner1 I was surprised to see Carluccios gone in Harrogate (not in the same league I know) as it always seemed heavingly busy. I wonder about the burden of Business Rates in a town like Harrogate. Also think it's a daytime place, with little nightlife. People go elsewhere.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mancunianmedic @ChrisMasonBBC My OH is obviously a twin in his man-nerisms. Do you also take mugs into the kitchen and put them near the dishwasher?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mancunianmedic @ChrisMasonBBC Ooh. I didn’t realise I was married to you 😳😳Do you have a twin?? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnnymacbirder Big and brownish. I might be able to spot that one! 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Went to hang up the home-made bird feeders at #Pugneys and was rewarded by a Treecreeper and a Willow Tit in return 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelenC0X I take a Tupperware-style box/es with me when I food shop. I ask for meat/fish/bacon/samosas - whatever I’m buying “loose” to be put in the box/es and the barcode label gets stuck to the lid.  One shop always wraps the meat in paper first, but that’s fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kendallybrown @borobarrister Leave. Now. If you haven't fled already 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayrayner1 Ah, but can she write in an engaging manner- which was your response to me in #Malton when I asked you what was the main requirement of your enviable job?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vacapinta @jayrayner1 If you can write as good a piece of prose as Jay's review of the George Cinq, then I'll read you any day. Let me know when you start 🤔😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @WakeyBirders Seen!! 🤗🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leedsbirder @rob_yaxley It's not what you know; it's who you know. Not that I know Mr Yaxley, but I do know, via Twitter, that he's an ecologist extraordinaire and fervent fungologist. 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley @leedsbirder Thanks for replying- was worth the retweet if you can help. 🤔👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2minbeachclean @Morrisons At the rate it's running out, it's our future, never mind that of non-existent grandchildren 😳Surprised by #Morrisons as they purport to be more eco aware than other supermarkets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TC174_NYP @NYPCravenRTF And other folk are moaning about being back in the office. What a job you have. Can't help, I'm afraid. We passed by just after the road was reopened.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jayrayner1 And if you read more of the T&amp;Cs, they appear to have been lifted from a Social Media website. Utter comedy, apart from the £13,800,000 of OUR money 😩😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cpt_horatio @tom_watson @ormondroyd There are sections which appear to have been lifted from a Social Media site, referring to being over 16 and not registering multiple memberships. I'm not sure that a genuine Ferry Company's T&amp;C would read like this!? #Seabourne<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tom_watson @ormondroyd So, Mr Watson, what are HM's Opposition doing about this utter farce? Surely someone - you for example - has the political clout to draw a halt to this utter mis-spend of our money? #Seabourne<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atherbron Will do! Thanks for the info 🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dragon_rat @clevelandbirds @teesmouthbc @RSPBSaltholme Ooh. I looked up Mr Unwin’s book on Amazon 😳😳I think I’ll have to save up for it!! 🙄😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clevelandbirds Thanks to all of you who replied to my Dorman's Pool query. There are lots of lovely folk out there happy to share knowledge and help. I always say that birders are good uns 👍👍🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fosterian1971 @clevelandbirds Thank you! No excuse for going now 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Teacosybobcap @clevelandbirds Useful knowing it’s a not-really private road! You see the sign and wonder if you should be there 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AWbirding @clevelandbirds Thank you! Saltholme is on the to-do list for early 2019, so I’ll add Dormans to it. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joneszghost @clevelandbirds Thanks Mal. We ‘discovered’ South Gare the other week - what a fantastic place. Heavy industrial monster architecture plus an SSSI. Looking forward to moving further north next time. 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joneszghost @clevelandbirds Aha! Shouldn't be too difficult to persuade OH to accompany me then if the Transporter Bridge is involved! 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clevelandbirds As a relative newcomer to Cleveland birding, I’m getting to know the places to go. However, I can’t track down Dormans Pool. Can you help please?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatHeath2 @Barnsleybsg @peakdistrict @michaelgove @MoorlandMonitor @RSPBbirders There were several fires visible yesterday from the A171 between Guisborough and Whitby. Lots of drifting smoke. No pics as I was driving.  N Yorks Moors already positively desert-like in places, species-wise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wendyredrobin I love South Gare. The only thing missing, however, is a cafe and a loo for cold days like yesterday 😳Dipped the Snow Bunting, got the Twite, Purple Sand and Sanderlings, so not bad for a flying visit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zuriag @clevelandbirds @nybirdnews @teesmouthbc The little gaggle of Purple Sandpiper were very accommodating in the rocks before the beach. They seemed quite unbothered by the visitors. #SouthGare<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave @mhemingway25 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 I'll keep an ear out for it.  Difficult to miss when it lets rip!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Behind you on 166 🙄 Must try and visit #Norfolk next year, to bump up numbers. Still, Mull and the Treshnish Isles were well worth the visit! #2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AddeyNick @nybirdnews Thanks for confirming what it was! Also a RT Diver North Bay with 5 Porpoises. And 12 Purple Sand along the wall from the Teapot. A good end to the year 👍👍<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder When I lost my Ma &amp; Pa 7 yrs ago, I missed giving them Xmas dinner which I'd done for years. So I pay for 2 places at #Crisis at Xmas so 2 others get the benefit. Not a big deal, but it helps me and them 🤔🤔🎄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning A good one for NYDay. Start the year off in style. We're in Whitby NYD and I'll try to engineer a quick visit to South Gare 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2minbeachclean @petetong @GWR Out of interest, is it indoor or outdoor? If indoor, it's a heap of dead balloons to clear up. If outdoor, it's a wholly different story. I assume they're air-filled, not helium. Still a ridiculous stunt.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wakeyweir86 @WakeyBirders Aha! That'll be the group of 12+ which I saw by the Pelican crossing the other week. I was worried then that they didn't know the Green Cross code. Have been scanning for casualties ever since, but none to date 😳😳😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jk_rowling Just listened to the Confrontation between Robin and Matthew on Lethal White audiobook. Gosh. Had to stop what I was doing and stood in the kitchen, willing her on. Magnificent writing. Thank you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@batanball @simmonite_dave The people who "count" won't be reading this, sadly. And if they do, they'll pooh pooh it and brush it under the carpet. It has been a deceitful campaign by Leave from the off. Good luck to you and your employees- you'll need it. #Brexmageddon<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@marksandspencer Thank you for your prompt reply. The coffee capsule plastic bags just seem so unnecessary and it's frustrating coming across excess packaging, especially from a reputable company as yourselves. Dare I say - every little helps 😳🙄😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>⁦@marksandspencer⁩ Sorry, M&amp;S. Won't be buying your coffee capsules again. 10 in a sealed box is fine. Putting them in 2 plastic bags is ridiculous.

<|startoftext|>@LansdellMum Hi. Read your bio notes on your account. Hope your daughter isn't called Hercule! Got me guessing now 🤔🤔🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder You may well joke. I once drove to Birmingham and 'realised' I'd left the iron plugged in at home. Rang key-holding neighbour in utter panic, to be told it was all tidied away with ironing board in the utility room. 🙄🙄😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bucktonbirder Hmm. I regularly sit with a little group when one asks why their answer isn't "acceptable" and sometimes it's not easy to explain! All brains are different and thought processes too.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DarrenNWoodhead @BirdLife_Malta @ChrisGPackham @BirdGuides @RSPBbirders @RareBirdAlertUK @BirdLife_News Well done Darren. What a fantastic way to use your talent. Your generosity of spirit is tremendous. I'm afraid all I can do is keep letting #Malta know why I won't be visiting the island until their "culture" changes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Some cracking comments here. 😀All I can say is thank god for the British sense of humour and irony.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bucktonbirder I spend time teaching y5 and 6 pupils to deal with KS2 Reading comprehensions. The required answers are generally non-negotiable. I assume there was a bit about the shape in the text 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @Wildlifepics1 If you're dog walking next to a hedge, far better to 'stick and flick' than leave a plastic tree decoration for years to come. 😩😩😡<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tommcnorris Are you back in Scotland for Christmas?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Andymartin1175 @nickmurftweets @leecaluan @PhelpsieSarah I think the division(S) caused by Brexit - in/out, young/old - will take a lot of healing. Years and years of recriminations to come. Many families already bitterly divided. When reality bites, things will only get more divided. Not the way for a successful country to go, sadly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tommcnorris Is if Glencoe ski lift that's gone bankrupt? Or is it the Cairngorms one?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leecaluan @Andymartin1175 @PhelpsieSarah @nickmurftweets No, it's OK. Unfortunately we oldies tend to get categorised as Leavers by the Media and it sticks. I'd've preferred 2 stay in &amp; work from within to make changes. As u say, 2 years without a clear vision has got us worse than nowhere, while a lot of important stuff is sidelined.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leecaluan @Andymartin1175 @PhelpsieSarah @nickmurftweets Interesting analysis. Don't forget it was us oldies who voted to take us IN to Europe in the first place. We're not all pink- faced, rabid Leavers.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm on the verge of switching off TV news, radio news and Twitter until it's all over 🙄🙄😩. #Brexit overload was bad enough. Now this as well. Think I'll stick my fingers in my ears and sing La La La.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulasherriff This is exactly the sort of problem which should be being debated, and which #Brexit has utterly sidelined. So many people affected on a daily basis. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McKenzie6593 I'm just struggling with the word 'conservation' in this context. I think autocorrect inadvertently replaced 'burning heather' and 'draining peat' with it 🙄🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyOceanRescue I'd be even happier if the kids who buy packets of Walkers on their way home from school didn't just drop the empty packets. I get fed up of picking them up and binning them. The packets, that is, not the kids. 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@biggesttwitch Hi. Cheeky query. Have a trekking hol booked to CRica in March with (non-birding) friends but am struggling to find suitable long sleeve shirts at this time of year. Any suggestions for where to look? Thanks 🙂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnTobytyke @Barnsleybsg @wheatearlp @mick_turton Absolutely marvellous 🙄😩A large expanse of habitat ignored by, and irrelevant to, planners. And untouched 'brownfield' sites are often a haven for wildlife. I despair. If it's near a transport corridor, just build on it. See J39 M1 near where I live. Utterly tarmac-ed. 😡😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Protect_Wldlife @simmonite_dave The whole thing looks like a throwback to the Seventies.  If you want a circus, pay to see humans perform at Cirque du Soleil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnTobytyke @Barnsleybsg @wheatearlp @mick_turton I assume an environmental audit was done as part of the planning process? Though no doubt lorry parks beat bird habitat for most folk. 😡😡😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whitburnbirds @jonnybirder @itvtynetees Whitby, Scarborough have spent money on big enclosed bins near chippies, &amp; posters which both remind folk that 'Our food isn't their food' &amp; explain why they shouldn't feed the gulls.

<|startoftext|>@angusbirdnews @simmonite_dave Oooh! My doggie does so love chasing the seagulls! Don't you, my little sweetheart poochy poo! Such fun!! 😡😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bucktonbirder @RSPBbirders Good luck. It's all the wrong way round. Rather like the Donald wanting to arm teachers to prevent school shootings, rather than enact gun control.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2minbeachclean My daughter works for a large, well known company. Earlier this year, their Purchaser audited their single use plastics, then got everyone (12000) a metal water bottle and set up water chillers across every office. No 'paper' coffee cups either.

<|startoftext|>@jahanlon2 @jonnybirder We stayed 3 nights at Cinnamon Lodge. 3 different kingfishers, shikra, monkeys, mega lizards, a vast wetland and a host of birds in the grounds and the massive organic garden. Quite unbelievable - can I go back please? 😀😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Protect_Wldlife @simmonite_dave I'm struggling with the word 'hunters' here. I don't imagine that they tracked it down themselves.

<|startoftext|>@RaptorPersScot @simmonite_dave Sadly, those responsible will a) wear gloves and b) make double sure of disposing of the avian evidence. 😡😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder @jahanlon2 We saw the Orange and blue version last year in SL, in the vegetable garden, of all places, of the hotel we were staying in. A woman appeared and said she'd seen a Bird of Paradise, which rather confused me to begin with.....<|endoftext|>

The no. of pheasants released last year was, apparently, 35 million 😳😳That's 1 for every 2 humans in the UK. No wonder I see dozens of road-kill pheasants in N Yorks.

<|startoftext|>@ChrisMasonBBC When you read tweets, you realise that @bbclaurak is both a Tory stooge and a rabid Labour apologist. At the same time. No doubt you get the same 🙄🙄😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayneChisholm @haveigotnews He was on Today R4 is morning, explaining why. It is not that he opposes them, but that they are 'nodded through' without due consideration and proper wording. The bill will be fully discussed early in the NYear, with proper time given.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@haveigotnews Fake news. I hold no candle for the man, but he is blocking these bills because of poor Parliamentary procedure. Bills need discussing, not going through 'on a nod' and his doing this ensures that they will have more time to be properly discussed (and worded) early in the NYear.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@waitrose I'm sure you do. I always feel welcome in a #Waitrose. It just seems like another cynical (!?) marketing ploy. Rather like rebranding Pre-Christmas Sales as Black Friday. It's a 'tradition' being foisted on us by shops.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoKingDevon I'm a 'late' birder, taking it up seriously on early retirement. I suppose being older, I'm not intimidated; if I'm not sure, I'll just ask 'what am I looking for' or 'anything of interest?' and I usually get the works. Sometimes a wader masterclass if I'm lucky 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoKingDevon Can I just say that the regular gents at #OldMoor are invariably happy to ID, point out, explain, teach, all in the nicest possible way. They are 'sharers' and pleased to do so. They've taught me a lot 🤗🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnSimpsonNews The UAE's vision of 'justice' is very different to ours. People are criticising Hunt, but in reality, he is up against the Emirati machine. A 4 minute, unrepresented, untranslated trial means the academic didn't stand a chance. How to retaliate? #Durham<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley I've just read this. 😩😩I must say I'm glad that we took our daughter, then age 9, on that road trip in 1996. It was all very empty then, maybe because Social Media hadn't been invented 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@simon_reeve I'm assuming that this is from #Rockstar, which was being lauded on the TV recently as a local success. I can't quite get my head round what it must be like to have an imagination that comes up with this as 'entertainment' for youngsters. 🤔🤔😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2minbeachclean I assume a lot of the onus must be on manufacturers to come up with alternative packaging. Yoghurt, sauces, pre-cooked rice, margarine - just wander the aisles to see what's in plastic. I can only assume it'll still end up incinerated as fuel for energy, as it's oil based.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EcoverUK It doesn't worry me. The bottle sits on the kitchen windowsill. Says more about what we call 'room temperature' in our house oop North!! It's the same phenomenon as olive oil, I assume, which goes cloudy in a fridge, then clears if warmed slightly. #Ecover<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DarrenNWoodhead The difficulty is if there's nowhere obvious to hand the camera in. I left my camera on a picnic bench in Greece, realised 5 miles up the road and drove back.

<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Sometimes Eider sheltering in the harbour. #Whitby<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WYP_WKBikeCops @Wintersett1 Out of interest, the other week we were overtaken by 2 "supercars" on the A1 south. Both turned off to Leeds. Neither had a rear number plate. Is that legal?? No red and white temporary plate, nothing. And nowhere really to put one for that matter! Just curious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GKTFO @jonnybirder You really don't need to understand the conversation....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder @rob_yaxley Thank you, young man. I will indeed look that up, now I know what to look for. Didn't think that googling 'spoony pom' would get me far!! 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley For the ignorant, what's a spoony Pom? I know what a Pom is btw 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Number10cat I love a cat that can use a semi-colon correctly 🤔😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wathingsmecca @Wintersett1 I like the little face at the window, peering in. The one at the rear of the pic, not the star bird 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2minbeachclean Our council warns not to put metallic wrapping paper in the recycling bin for this reason. It needs to either not be bought 🙄or put in household waste. Our council will then incinerate it. I check wrapping paper is actual paper; we're also fond of IKEA brown paper 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EcoNerdier @2minbeachclean The compostable cups/cutlery can only break down in a commercial composter e.g. One run by a council. The heat from a domestic heap/bin is insufficient. Not all councils collect food waste for composting and that is the problem 🤔🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StansaidAirport You flattering old smoothie you. 🙄🙄😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StansaidAirport Or like me, just look in the mirror 😩😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This to complain about RoyalMail rubber bands being dropped/littered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ASPaton @Wintersett1 Sadly, this is legal. Open season currently for Game Bird shooting, including Snipe. Jack Snipe are protected. Grey Partridge may also be shot, despite being red-listed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveDunnHQ @jahanlon2 I couldn't possibly comment! But she certainly seems to have a rather warped view of life. I thought it bad enough seeing pics of Giraffe and Zebra as 'trophies', but Sheep?? 🐏🐏🐐🐐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveDunnHQ @jahanlon2 It gets better/worse. Yesterday, she posted a photo of herself posing beside....... a sheep that she had bravely shot in the face of great personal danger, no doubt. Who on God's earth shoots sheep?? The woman isn't the full shilling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ianrobinson271 I'm glad it waited for you!! With you all the way, metaphorically speaking. Birding brought me out of a difficult place too. Keep looking forward 👍👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Recordshotmyars 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂Gives up at this point. Not as much patience as you 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder 3/3 And while I'm here, so much habitat and open land lost nearby along DenbyDaleRoad to Peel Estates mega development, and that was GreenBelt. So council need to balance matters. We'll see what happens now 🤔🤔🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder 2/2 empty shops etc in Wakey and I'm sure brownfield sites south-side if he cares to do a cursory search. As for public support, read the planning website. My objection was one of many, both on GreenBelt and traffic grounds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder I could write an essay on this. Woodhead (presumably) had the field rough ploughed 3/4 yrs ago which was then left to rewild so it appears "messy" (i.e. Good habitat, Grey Partridge etc). It's behind a very busy area which is already under traffic stress. There are numerous 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daraobriain Well this woman has certainly set Twitter aflame today. I'm beginning to assume it's a really bad-taste self-publicity stunt that she's dreamt up. Hunting sheep and wild goat? If it wasn't for the vainglorious photos, I'd think it was a joke. Get her off #Islay ASAP please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ASPaton @simmonite_dave Whaaat?? Is that even legal?? Since when did people hunt and shoot goats on Islay?? I'm literally gobsmacked and furious 😩😩😡😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley Euw. I'd rather not. There's something about a scuttling cockroach 😱😱that doesn't endear them to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankRGardner @SharonSutton8 I think what surprises me most is that you appear to have been invited to an event at this building, yet nobody thought through how to effect your access.

<|startoftext|>@FrankRGardner Well here's another 60-something who would have felt privileged to have assisted you. The way you get around the globe, lots of folk must think the same, fortunately 👍👍<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MoorlandMonitor Several sites burned Saturday North Yorks Moors for second week in a row. No photos, sorry. Clearly visible from Sutton Bank.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimBirchWild @Wintersett1 @DerbysWildlife @peakdistrict @uknationalparks @RuthGeorgeMP More burning yesterday at several sites on the North Yorks Moors. Standing near Sutton Bank VC looking north, we could see that the smoke was drifting low, East, for miles and miles. The smoke #pollution must have been horrendous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@birdingprof I hope you resisted the temptation to accidentally kick over his scope as you left 😱😱🤔😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@birdingprof I think it says more that this is the first time it's happened. In the relatively short time I've been 'proper birding, I've invariably found other birders to be Sharers and many are genuinely pleased to help and answer my questions 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jgsigsworth Did the Cleveland Way bit from Rievaulx to Sutton Bank this aft. Beautiful countryside and views, the only downside being the pheasant/partridge war zone in the woods. Plenty of escapees fortunately 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robinlemare @MRewilding @GeorgeMonbiot Well I'll disagree with that. Just stood and watched a tractor part-ploughing grassland that was badly flooded earlier in the year, being followed by a massive flock of gulls. They usually appear when he ploughs, along with crows, woodies and lapwing on occasions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ExplorerJust Just think how handy it would be if oranges had, say, their own covering. Like peel, say. Sort of thickish, orangey coloured, that you could take off with your fingers or a knife. #drowninginplastic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeWantPlates I'm sorry. All totally unacceptable. A chilled balloon glass, ice, something fruity and a good wallop of gin is all that is needed. Anything like the photos would've gone straight back. Possibly thrown at the barman😩😩🍸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohonSchepe @Wintersett1 If you want something for the pot, keep chickens or shoot rabbits, to be blunt. I can't imagine there's much on a robin. A sorry, sorry excuse for hunting. I'd rather feed my garden robins than eat them 🙄😩😩#CABS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StephBirdArt @simmonite_dave 2/2. It's a Peacock replied boyfriend. I thought everyone knew what peacocks look like, but she didn't. I was shocked at her ignorance, so not knowing that Wildcats aren't wild cats doesn't amaze me at all. 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephBirdArt @simmonite_dave Don't know why you're surprised. "We" are increasingly divorced from nature. Stopped off in Kirkleatham other week for a coffee in Museum garden.

<|startoftext|>@flako1959 Erm, if I remember rightly, there's a funicular 🙄 The little road from the top was very tree-lined. Have you found the amazing dancing musical fountains in the park? Can also recommend the Thermal baths if you want a bit of a relax. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jgsigsworth We have the best pair of Posties ever. I'll have to ask them what they think about this.  I'm sure they aren't paid one percent of what this bloke is getting. #RoyalMail<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning I was at the E end of Pugneys this morning and could see in the distance a large flock of what I think were Winter Thrushes. They were too far to ID and very mobile, dipping below tall trees. Couldn't get close enough i.e. I'd have had to run 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveOrmerod @simmonite_dave I despair. I really do. I don't 'like' spiders but never squish them, ever. We get horse-size ones in the bath (slight Exaggeration) but they get the glass and card treatment and then put in the garden, probably to return to the bath.....🙄🙄Kids need spider education, really.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveOrmerod @simmonite_dave Or even *Spiders* 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ThomasPride @Wintersett1 If I remember rightly, if one serves on a jury, one is obliged to say if one has a connection to the accused etc. to ensure probity and fairness. Is it to much to ask that the judge should also have such an obligation? 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley And I assume you know why M Macron has only one egg for breakfast?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarraghHudson Rather reminiscent of patch birding at #Pugneys! 😂😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RSPBbirders @RSPBNews @martinRSPB Thank you. It's one of those contrary things. The criminal deed has been done but it would have been a shame to destroy them. I do hope he ( I assume it is a he) has them confiscated. What a very, very sad hobby. Shakes head.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mn_reeder Very sad indeed. Presumably it hit a window?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trolleywise @AsdaServiceTeam Miraculously both trolleys have gone. I assume someone has pulled them out and returned them. However there are a couple more further down. I'll get back to TWise tomorrow with location 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AsdaServiceTeam @Trolleywise Hi Liam. This is an ongoing problem with stray trolleys. Before I bother @trolleywise, can you confirm that Asda Wakefield is using them now, because they weren't a wee while ago. Thanks<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@simon_reeve Oh dear, Simon. You've hit a nerve there 🙄We birders were hoping you might also have touched on that other Maltese 'cultural tradition' of illegal bird 'hunting' aka target practice. Plenty of proof out there, sadly.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WildlifeInWakey No I've not heard Tawnies but regularly hear the Little Owl out hunting at night. Have been told there's (been) a #Tawny nearby but never seen or heard. Have heard them Bretton Park though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2minbeachclean This drives me potty (🙄) In rural areas, people poop-scoop then leave the plastic bag. If the bags were compostable, they could chuck the bag and contents into the nearest bramble patch and nature would take its course. Would that help? 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BoothsCountry I was planning on cooking it at the weekend, was checking through the ingredients and read the method. Glad you clarified, but I'd have probably used a lower temp anyway 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@robertgriffiths @cathgem2000 @lizbonnin @RSPBScotland @mcsuk @FidraTweets @ScotWildlife @GPUKoceans @HWDT_org @FoEScot @sascampaigns @2minbeachclean @KSBScotland 2/2 And if you've been watching the tsunami reports on the chaos there, 4 days with no gov assistance to towns affected, you'll know that they don't seem to have a very organised gov. Sadly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robertgriffiths @cathgem2000 @lizbonnin @RSPBScotland @mcsuk @FidraTweets @ScotWildlife @GPUKoceans @HWDT_org @FoEScot @sascampaigns @2minbeachclean @KSBScotland The big manufacturers are quick to flood (literally) countries with their products, with no regard to what happens to leftover packaging. Indonesia is not alone here. They should be funding assistance from profits in setting up effective waste collection and recycling plants. 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gary1165 @the_ecologist Thank you. But does that mean that there are 'pheasant farms' for the rest? There seems to be a huge number of wild birds where I live.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@defsdoor And I have had no response from @MandS_UK despite the fact that it seems to contradict their much publicised Plan A packaging advertising #DrowingInPlastic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gary1165 @the_ecologist This is a genuine question. Where do the pheasant and grouse chicks (if that is the correct word) come from? I'm assuming that not all breed naturally from free birds, or am I wrong?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@defsdoor 3/3. Apparently, food manufacturers use black plastic packaging because 'we' ie consumers prefer it as makes the food look more appetising. Can you remember ever being asked?? It's an utter nonsense. #DrowingInPlastic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@defsdoor 2/3 I'm not dismissing the problem. I tweeted M&amp;S last week re this. They are using black plastic trays which are not recyclable as the black pigment is not 'read' by the recycling infrared system. If they used grey/silver/blue etc, it would.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@defsdoor According to info from our local recycling company, such material (usually plastic) is incinerated as it is basically the same as burning oil. The energy produced is then used in different ways, depending on the company running the incinerator.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2minbeachclean @lizbonnin @BBCEarth It rather puts our problems in perspective, sadly. And I'm certainly not trying to minimise our problems. 😩😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tommcnorris Steady on! You'll be starting a bird list at this rate! 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grahambwfc @k_ingham @WeWantPlates If it's a 45 then that's a very small burger. And as anyone who ever watched Blue Peter knows, if you heat records, they buckle. So how do you wash them properly? #StickyFingers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeanthorpeRR Not a statement many people get to write!! 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeanthorpeRR Just watch yourself on that beak, Jean! It'll have your eye out 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grayspeight @Barnsleybsg @Wintersett1 @BirdGuides 🤔🤔How many? In garden (near Sandal Castle) half an hour ago and looked up to see 2 big birds soaring/gliding over, long legs, long straight wings. Have never seen Cranes in the air before. I know when I'm seeing something that I don't know!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SachaCrowley71 @RSPBbirders If he does and is caught, sentence will be reviewed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RSPBbirders Conditional discharge requires defendant to stay out of trouble. If he reoffends then sentencing will change. Hope someone's keeping a close eye on him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QueenofSpain @wilgils We've just been watching this on the News. Very difficult viewing. And we decided that, judging on his performance, he wasn't the man for the job<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2minbeachclean One disincentive of 'drink- in' as opposed to takeaway hot drinks is the VAT difference. Maybe that is something that needs to be discussed. And do we know if #Pret is still serving drink-in coffee in takeaway cups?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Aha! I must have missed you again! My Grey Phal record shot is of a little blobby bird the same colour as the water. The Goldies were a pleasant surprise though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pwookey As a Woman, I rather object to your calling her a Woman. Another epithet is needed. 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave I must admit, I find the bicycle rather at odds with the rifle 😳😳 Having said that, it's scary to see such a sight when you're quietly birding on an RSPB reserve.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4 Grey Partridge and 1 RLPartridge on field near Farm, where the muck stack was. They weren't in a hurry to move 👍#Pugneys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lornamedia Bless him. You're a lucky lady 🙂🙂🍜🎂🍰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Am about to go on a patch walk. Any advice for the Whinchat? Me seeing it, I mean, not for the bird, obviously 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2minbeachclean Yet more organisations happily believing that balloons are biodegradable. If that means that they burst into little pieces at altitude (which fall to earth and are mistaken for food) and hang around for several years, then yes they're biodegradable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder You'll not be allowed to leave Mallorca. Ever. Get the school places sorted now and Learn Spanish. A couple of tents would be good. 😱😱😂<|endoftext|>

Might make for interesting viewing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theipaper Afternoon. Could someone please tell Jeff Robson that last night's #Bodyguard was 'wire-taut' and not "wire-taught'. Where's the sub-ed when you need one? 🙄#Pedant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LynnCroweSHU @BBCNews At the very least, I'd thought it would have warranted a mention on #Countryfile that night, though I'm aware it's filmed in advance. Not impossible to do however.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder But like some blokes I know 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@annanderson2012 @docrussjackson @dillydolly4 @TechnicallyRon 😱😱😱😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarraghHudson With a Cetti's, you only need to hear it call once, it's so distinctive! Spent a while looking for the Bittern the other day, as per Ian Bev, but no joy. Several non-regulars were also arriving, having had an alert on RBN 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dan_Gornall Not sure who's watching whom?! Rather like getting close to the Puffins on the Treshnish Isles - they're almost hypnotic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrewp538 @2minbeachclean Well yes, but surely Freepost costs them? Just think if we all did this😱😱 They'd soon find an alternative. Like cellophane. Non-oil based packaging.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarraghHudson Details please? I heard it twice earlier in the year, in bushes between Main and Reserve, near the hide.  Where is it now? #Pugneys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juliatetley @TC1552_NYP Yes, ours was a corroded wire under the bonnet somewhere. At least it was "only" the woo-woo alarm and not the ear-breaking "armed" alarm that you get if you accidentally lock the vehicle then switch on the ignition. Try that one in a mult-storey 😱😱#Defender<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Several parked cars in stubble field near #Marton. Half a dozen blokes in field. Shooting? Hare coursing? 😳😳No- Detectorists!! 🙄😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@docrussjackson @dillydolly4 @TechnicallyRon Oh dear. There's something I'll never be able to unsee 😱😱😩😩😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jessphillips On you go then, Jess. What's stopping you? 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CerayeSand @YoloBirder I think the shooting industry is fightened by #Packham's general popularity and 'niceness' for want of a better word. They see his access to the media as a threat and so attempt to belittle him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Walked a section of the #ClevelandWay yesterday from #Filey to #Scarborough accompanied by #Swallows and #HouseMartins all the way until outskirts of Scarborough. Hundreds of them 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TC1552_NYP Happened to us. Defender alarm developed a fault and set itself off at 5am. Could not stop it. Had to wait till 8 for garage to open. Drove thru town with alarm woo-wooing. And neighbours slept thru it 😱😱😩😩Embarrassing!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder They suffer from Selective Hearing. They ignore everything else and focus in on factors which are not favourable to them, then trash the lot. It's a sad state of affairs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CABS_REPORTS @BirdLife_Malta This is all depressingly familiar. And this is why, @VisitMalta @VisitMaltaUK I won't be visiting your island for a holiday. How many times have I tweeted this? Too many. #IllegalHunting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Co-op to replace single-use carrier bags with compostables  https://t.co/6XYZHjqdsD The best non-plastic option. #Whitby store trialled them earlier and they're brilliant. Put your peelings in them then onto the compost heap #Coop #PlasticPollution<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lawt_d @BillAspin @Lancswildlife @peakdistrict A very damning article. Must've been like shooting fish in a barrel, they soar so slowly. Utterly barbaric and depressing #RedKite<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobGMacfarlane @ChrisGPackham Elms. Who last saw an Elm?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fileybirder I think you're probably right. I just can't help myself sometimes! 🙄I know what I (don't) see when I'm out there, as you're no doubt aware yourself #NYMoors<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@land_guardian @jim_eatwell @GeorgeMonbiot @Fileybirder I'm not disputing the Dales; I'm referring to the NY Moors, East of the A1. I do see birds there, I must admit, but for such a massive area, should see far, far more. Raptors in particular are sadly lacking. Yet I see Red Kites over the A64 and over my daughter's house in Leeds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@land_guardian @GeorgeMonbiot @Fileybirder Not when I'm in the passenger seat 🙄 I can look where I like. And when we drive along the A64 from Leeds to Malton, I see all sorts both in the air and in the fields. I am a birder. I know what I'm (not) seeing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamieMc10396965 @stella_plage Yes it does. What I think people are querying is whether the EHIC card will be valid for U.K. citizens in the event of a No Deal #Brexit when anything could happen. We just don't know and neither do the people who should 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skylarkwarrior @HenmanAnthony Sadly, round here, the motor vehicle is the most important predator of Hedgehogs. Rarely seen alive, regularly seen squashed at the road side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeMonbiot @Fileybirder We regularly visit/walk/drive the North Yorks Moors. Last Saturday, from Hutton-le-Hole to A171. Steady 16 mile drive. Apart from sheep, total wildlife spotted was one Red Grouse and one Kestrel. And the odd Gull flying over. Marvellous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fisermanian Where did you find the Cetti's? Still between Main and Reserve lakes or has it moved much?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StackingCats They've had them since Y1 and they're now Y6. Robust and get chucked around the playground on occasions and survive. The bottles, that is, not the kids. I don't think the metal ones were around then and are rather pricey by comparison 🙄🙄😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 @spurnbirdobs Doh. I see your name and instantly think #Pugneys. Then I get to the end. Spurn.  🙄🙄😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StackingCats The Primary School where I volunteer provides a plastic water bottle per child. They keep them in the classroom, fill from the tap as required, take them out at break and tidy away at end of day. Simple but effective 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2minbeachclean @Pret So sounds like a management decision. And meanwhile, they're banging on about their green credentials and how they are an ethical company. I assume someone thinks it's cheaper to do this?? 😩😩Hypocrisy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2minbeachclean Me. I think it's ridiculous. You'll know the tweet doing the rounds about 'high tech' throwaway plastic teaspoons v steel wash-up ones. This, I think, is worse. I hate drinking coffee out of 'paper' cups and this is totally avoidable. Is it just one outlet? @Pret<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave You and me alike, then, though I'm afraid I resort to colouring mine 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LoopydeeScott @Number10cat What is missing here, I now realise, is a pair of ski poles. She's actually Langlauf skiing. 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2minbeachclean @Pret Have you suddenly lost the ability to do a bit of washing up?  This is utterly ridiculous and should not be happening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fisermanian That's good news! No Spotted Crake as well, I suppose? 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarinaOLoughlin A friend has a professional decorators' warehouse. He says that grey in all its 50 shades is THE colour of choice at the moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley And some excellent cake awaits too 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley @BSBIbotany It looks like one in my garden i.e. Nursery bought ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimonBruni @simmonite_dave I have said before that we voted on a pig in a poke. Blind. Uninformed. Ignorant. Unknowing. Call it what you will. Now the whole mess is becoming clear, and omnishambles is approaching, we need to look at the facts and reconsider. #Lemmings #Abyss #Ref2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamieMc10396965 @stella_plage No, they would have treated him regardless but then required a hefty payment. The question is, with #Brexit, will EHIC reciprocal agreement cease, and if so, how would an uninsured person cope with payment?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What an unbelievably fantastic array of photos. A very talented bunch of people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RSPB_OldMoor Can you please bring back the good old tea pot? Tea is just so much better made in a proper pot, rather than a teabag dunked in a mug 😟😟 I know it was probably a diktat from Head Office to ditch the pots 🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PalmerstonFOCat Gladstone disappeared? Fake Mews 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alpro I was more questioning the sources of water in coastal Spain, where water is 'moved' from further inland to irrigate almond trees. This affects friends of ours who live in rural Spain.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave I drive all the way to Redcar South Gare for the Pom Skua and who do I end up chatting to? The lovely Gerald! What a gent 🤗🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthSiderUK Thanks for the advice re South Gare. Pom Skua, a couple of Roseate Tern, 2 Whimbrel, Wheatear and a Little Egret tucked in on a pool opp the steel works. Definitely worth the drive! What an interesting place 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthSiderUK Well here I am watching it posing for its public, mooching off the side of the breakwater. Thanks!! #PomSkua<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthSiderUK Ooh thank you! I was looking at the area on satellite view and wondered where to start 😳😳My only idea was to watch out for long lenses and scopes 🙄I'll let you know how we get on! 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_emmactidxo @simmonite_dave Stone. Scone. They rhyme. Unless you're my Barnsley husband who pronounces it Ston. So he says Scon. But he also calls bread buns Tea Cakes. And I tell him Tea Cakes have dried fruit in them. And then we argue about that yet again. You'll never win, whichever way you say it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthSiderUK I'm assuming as well it's being well fed if it's hanging around? We don't know South Gare - any advice?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jgsigsworth The 52 Pheasant in 2 adjacent fields were easier to ID !! Yellow Wags in with the sheep near Helmsley were a bonus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jgsigsworth The 3 were giving it the nasal 'nee nee' call. The bridge pair were very mobile and silent. They confused me as the light was poor as it was drizzly. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justclearuk @2minbeachclean No. it's the 'wrong' plastic. Plus it's contaminated with metal bits and tape.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthSiderUK @nybirdnews @clevelandbirds Trust it's still there in the morning. 😳😳 #PomSkua #SouthGare<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jgsigsworth Walked Helmsley to Rievaulx and back this morning. 3 Willow Tit in little valley by stone steps &amp; 2 more at Rievaulx bridge. First 3 were calling so def WT, other 2 silent but matt-black heads. Is my assumption correct?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PopnMatters @itvnews As per the President of Tanzania who helpfully declared that Birth Control is unnecessary and not a good idea.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@2minbeachclean I suspect a lot will be incinerated as they are oil-based, where it is an option 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2minbeachclean Interesting, but who is going to buy one at that price? There must be millions of #VHS cassettes hanging around UK houses gathering dust. Councils need to advertise an 'amnesty' week and they could do us all a favour!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2minbeachclean There's a difficult one. I had no joy disposing of some via charity shops or recycling. Try Freecycle or EBay but be prepared for landfill (may be incinerated)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirdwatchExtra The SL Wetlands are amazing. Our hotel last year  #CinnamonLodge has a massive wetland attached to its grounds, owned by the Gov but maintained and protected by the hotel. Win win. Full of remarkable little birds and waders. #SriLanka<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tommcnorris Hampshire?? 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnnyboy7169 @davelee1968 No, Sunday Times. It certainly would be laugh a minute with #Boris in charge. A bit like with #Trump, when you wake up before the news every day and wonder, 'Hmm. What's he done now that will bring us closer to chaos?'<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@givemetap Order #G3211. Hi. Still waiting for my bottle, ordered 15 August and which was apparently going to be posted last Monday.

<|startoftext|>@ChrisCameron57 @WestMidBirdClub @CABS_REPORTS @VisitMaltaUK @VisitMalta We've visited many European countries and islands over the years and I'd like to add #Malta to the list but not while this goes on.

<|startoftext|>Still waiting, @givemetap 😟😟<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DancingTheMind @simmonite_dave I've said this before but I'll repeat myself. Ref1 was voting on a pig in a poke. We hadn't a clue as to the magnitude of the decision. The cat is now out of the bag and we need to reappraise the situation. Urgently #Brexit #Ref2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@givemetap Well I'm still waiting for my water bottle which I ordered on 15 August. You were very quick to take my money but this is getting ridiculous. If it was dispatched on Monday, as you said, it must be walking here. 🙄🙄😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobGMacfarlane I came across 'thole' when reading the late Reginald Hill's Dalziel and Pasco novels. Used by Dalziel, a Yorkshireman via Scotland. I had to look it up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BTCare Also, can I use the BT mobile assist box with a Plusnet router/hub?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BTCare Mine was wifi calling compatible under EE but not now as my elderly iPhone won't accept the necessary upgrade for BTMobile to run it, sadly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BTCare Morning! Do BT do a mobile signal booster box? I'm with BTmobile in a rural area with poor signal. Openreach guy says EE does a box you plug into the router (ours is Plusnet) Is there the equivalent BTMobile one? Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StansaidAirport Though having said all that, it's still in the middle of nowhere. You have to really want to go there. You can't just be 'passing through by accident' 😳😳#Hull<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StansaidAirport I'm only half laughing. We went to #Hull the other week and were genuinely pleasantly surprised. Town centre spotless, excellent FREE museums and galleries and some good cafes. I'd go again! 😳😳<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_BTO Will do. 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikewatsonfoto @BillAspin The poor #Whitby Desert Wheatear survived a bad winter for weeks on mealworms but they proved his undoing. Sitting target, sadly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_BTO Sadly I'm not near a 'square' for this one, but will listen out for Tawnies. A neighbour has one roosting in his woodshed we think, judging by the pellets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArchieRaven @simmonite_dave @MaltaGov @maltatoday @VisitMalta @VisitMaltaUK @VisitMalta I'm another one who will not visit your island for this reason. I'd enjoy the history, food, beaches and countryside but this is part of your 'culture' that is unforgivable 😟😟So along with many, many others, I go elsewhere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_BTO It was your Winter Thrushes survey that got me out and about every day after a very difficult time in my life. I saw a newspaper article and thought I could do that. And it got me into birding and a much better place. 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@givemetap Order #G3211 Ordered bottle 15 days ago. Very slick ordering process BUT have had no update on my order. Very disappointing delivery service. How much longer?? 😩😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BN Grebe still #Pugneys Main Lake in SE corner. Visible from little hide 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BTCare It's not a fault. There's just no signal as Marton is in the middle of North Yorkshire where phone signals are notoriously poor. Your signal map says it all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Grebe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stewchat @BBCBreakfast @O2 Next to no signal in Marton nr Pickering for BT mobile or EE. Vodaphond is a bit better but iffy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FightingGran @marcuschown @simmonite_dave Sorry, but Panama is FAR too warm and comfortable 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2minbeachclean And the sad thing is that all these initiatives are because so many people can't be arsed to dispose of rubbish/litter in a sensible and responsible manner. 🙄🙄🚯🚯<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jgsigsworth Aha. I hadn't realised that's the first stage of the #ClevelandWay. That might be the start of a do-it-in-stages project for us now that OH has completed all the Wainwrights in the Lakes. He can't sit still 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@givemetap Still no news about the dispatch of my bottle, ordered 11 days ago 😟😟<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobGMacfarlane This was my first bird book. It's still on my bookshelf, along with the notes and dates I added. And I don't normally write in books. 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jgsigsworth I'd not thought of that one! I'll check out the bus timetable 👍Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gazatkinsonpics @nybirdnews Walked from Helmsley to Rievaulx yesterday. Not one Swift, but numerous Swallows (many of them juveniles) around, plus a White-tailed Eagle by the looks of it - which somewhat startled me till I remembered Duncombe Park 😳😳🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tykebirder @simmonite_dave @IoloWilliams2 @NatResWales I'll hazard a guess at rather fewer than the large number of #Pheasants I see as roadkill when travelling around North Yorkshire.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@givemetap Hi. It's #G3211 if that helps. Thanks for getting back to me. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley @Norwichbirder Sounds right. They looked rather like the ones you see on French markets but much bigger. The very specific habitat / height they were growing at was interesting. Thanks, both of you 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@givemetap Hi. Am getting rather impatient here waiting for news of my order. Ordered a 500ml bottle last Wednesday and still no notification of shipping. Have you forgotten me? 😟😟<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorfolkITguy @mickybooble @jayrayner1 It was a question I always asked about the USA and decided that they got the leaders who had enough $$ to buy office.

<|startoftext|>@phil11936 @jonnybirder This is an utterly brilliant thread. I'd rather DB was more concerned about misleading food labelling e.g. Chicken n mushroom pot noodles which contain no proper chicken or mushrooms yet which sound healthy. #PretendFood<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley @Norwichbirder They seemed to start flat, then the older ones were crinkly and developed a trumpet shape. They seemed very height/ terrain specific.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeEvansBirding @jeanthorpeRR @Natures_Voice @_BTO @MarkAvery I can't begin to imagine why such licenses might be needed. Most of those mentioned are very mobile. Is it nests that are removed? Utterly baffled.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tweetato1 @BellaLack @BlackLabrador10 The problem is that the stuff is in so many types of product, not just food items. It shouldn't be labelled as Vegetable Oil but sometimes is, so is difficult to spot. And sadly, it's highly profitable #PalmOil<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WilboRose @YoloBirder @TheBirdfair He's far more handsome than I'd ever imagined. 😳😳<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mn_reeder "Yes, but sadly the birds don't like to see him". Anthropomorphism and dog ownership seem to go hand in hand 🙄🙄😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave That Datura plant is now uprooted. The Wiki info was rather scary!! OH was driving fortunately so I didn't crash. They were on a low banking that forms part of the verge with a crop field on the other side of the hedge. Never seen them there before!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Currently c12 Grey Partridge watching the traffic going by from the verge opposite Asda on Asdale Road. Quite a surreal sight #PartridgeFamily #Wakefield<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2minbeachclean I reckon that anything that's septic tank friendly is the better option. And Ecover is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carl_thompson70 Just make sure your beer glass is out of reach when you do. You'll splutter your beer everywhere otherwise. 😩😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carl_thompson70 Well trust me. If you ever need a giggle, Google the outfits- the hats in particular- worn by the pair. To think they had endless money to spend 😳🙄🙄😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RSPBbirders @Stewchat Well it's all in the name of Conservation, you know. Just not wildlife conservation 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carl_thompson70 Oh come on. If you remember the outfits she and Beatrice wore for William's wedding, it would be worth it for the comedy viewing alone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simon_reeve 😳😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ipaperviews @stephenkb Some of us ARE very worried about #Brexit but we don't know at this stage what we can do about any of it. It's like watching the proverbial car crash in very slow motion and being powerless to intervene. #Madness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@becclestown @2minbeachclean We run a holiday home and stress to our guests exactly what does and doesn't get flushed. And the consequences if it doesn't happen! So far...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2minbeachclean @becclestown If everyone without a septic tank  acted as if they had one, what goes down drains would be less 'toxic'. Gentler cleaners, no bleach, no wet wipes, no fat and oil - it's not difficult to manage like this. It's second nature to some of us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder Maybe. A silent auction requires a sheet of paper. Name, phone no and bid by first person. Next people interested bid higher by adding their name etc to the list.   Might be a good idea for the holiday prize?  I bought an artwork like that a few years ago. You inform winner 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder Hope you've got your ticket quandary sorted?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NaturalEnglund @Fileybirder They're all very skilled in the use of meaningless, obfuscatory jargon. It makes it all seem very nice and professional. 🙄🙄😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder @Wintersett1 Looks to me that he's the 'grain collector' for a combine harvester, judging by the trailer. It isn't a flaying machine.  🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder @JohnLawArt @Wintersett1 Just don't go spraying it anywhere! Like local crop fields. I think you can get little pots with a sponge on, like shoe-polish things, but a wash up sponge is good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder @JohnLawArt @Wintersett1 2/2 So she waited for it to do its worst and still, 2 years on, gets mini plants popping up. I'm afraid she has found that a sponge dipped in Roundup ( wear gloves) and dabbed on the new leaves is the only thing that hits it. It is stinky when pulled. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder @JohnLawArt @Wintersett1 I was about to say Houttunia. There was a patch of it in my daughter's garden when she moved in. She redesigned the garden and wanted it out. We dug and dug for weeks to get every scrap out - the roots are friable and every tiny broken bit makes a new plant. 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bluebellpond Was your brown envelope not fat enough? #Allegedly #joke 🙄🙄Planning is one of the great mysteries of our age. Very un-transparent IMHO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeWantPlates @ruthreed01 It must be incredibly windy in that restaurant if that's what it takes to keep the bill from flying away 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bluebellpond Why are they trying to close you down? Who have you upset?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyedalePolice Well, when you drive round the mean streets of Ryedale, you never quite know what's round the corner 😳 That's what makes the place so interesting. Tractor rally? Vintage cars? Horse and traps? Combine harvesters? Cycling road races? NY has them all 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ceeste45 I can think of many better ways of spending that money!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@corrie_corfield No wonder the poor model looks totally fed up. So would I if I looked that ridiculous wearing something so hugely expensive 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vegware Thank you! I'll give it a read 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simon_reeve 😩😩😩😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder Yes. Having run bog-standard school fete tombolas, I know you don't want your best stuff disappearing early doors on Friday (as happens according to Sod's Law). Silent auctions are easy to organise or do a sealed bid auction?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder How many tickets are you planning? What proportion are winners? How much do you hope to make? Answer them and you'll find your price. Or do a silent auction or a Dutch auction (I think it's called) for the Big Prizes if you think that would be more profitable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RosenTheUnready @1seanmiller @JamesMelville It is my understanding that much of the meat sold by the main supermarkets is halal but not marked as such. I am happy to be corrected if this is not the case. The headline is a very clumsy way of reporting the fact. And no, I'm most definitely not a Daily Fail reader.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisGPackham @BillAspin Was up on the NY Moors above #RosedaleAbbey on Saturday and it was teeming with grouse - 12 visible just from the path alone. Had a word with them to get down the valley, but not sure if they were listening. Like fish in a barrel, sadly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DerbyBarrister @borobarrister What an inspirational story. Good luck to you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder I'm afraid I do have a container of Roundup in the garage as it's the only thing that deals with bindweed which invades the garden from the field. It's the plant from Hell 🙄😳Sponge it onto the leaves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wakeyweir86 @WakeyBirders I'll keep an eye open along there.  I don't think I've heard one and they're pretty distinctive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wakeyweir86 @WakeyBirders A nice haul. Where was the Nuthatch? The Little Owl is back at the farm and there are Grey Partridge knocking about in the stubble, adults and young.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HilaryChamber17 @YoloBirder @DurhamBirdClub @durhamwildlife From one Hilary to another - not many of us out here 😳 I'm very sorry to read this. There's a Little Owl in old farm buildings near our house, and I look out for him every time I pass. When he's there, in his usual window, my heart lifts 🌞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@9stan @jonnybirder Unbe-bluddy-lievable. Ghost hunt? It's what the National Trust do in historic houses, not a wildlife trust. You really couldn't make it up 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Teacosybobcap @JimAshton_ @Butterfly_bros 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimAshton_ Thanks. We'll try and save as much water as possible to return to the pond. Duckweed is the work of the devil 😡😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimAshton_ @Butterfly_bros Advice please. We have a pre-formed pond that has been in action for years but which has never been cleaned out. It's filling up with dead leaves etc and I'm battling duckweed. When should I bite the bullet and empty/clean it out?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Rook at this mess: French park trains crows to pick up litter  https://t.co/ThigDOkQOy 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArabellaSock We saw this around Westminster the other w/end. No bins (security) so bottles, cups etc placed on ledges, tables, seats and stuffed into the big bridge defences. And they were there all weekend, only collected by the council on the Monday morning. Not a good look.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peston Coming back from Manc Airport last month. Elderly couple had got on wrong train. Guard was endlessly patient checking how best to get them to their destination. They would have been in a real mess without professional help and knowledge 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gubmom4 @hullsands @CountrysideBen With the current state of the landscape, and having had a 15 acre crop fire very near our house, I don't think anything burning being let loose is in anyone's interests. 😳I'm for tree planting and you can tie message tags to branches 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave @docmartin2mc Thanks! I'll give it a try. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@docmartin2mc @simmonite_dave I'll find a sound file and take a listen. Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ruskin147 @borobarrister My favourite presenter and interviewer. A brilliant listener with, at times, a wicked sense of humour. I'll miss that unmistakable voice. #EddieMair<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rowe_tc @Stewchat There's always one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@docmartin2mc @simmonite_dave Can I just ask how you know what one sounds like?  A genuine question. I've never even seen one, never mind seen enough to recognise the call !😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CleanerSeasProj @2minbeachclean @hmtreasury @michaelgove @vegware @TIPACorp @DefraGovUK @WRAP_UK @circulareconomy @IcelandRichard My understanding of this, following queries to our local 'tip' is that such items can be composted with collected food waste as some (not our) councils facilitate. Ordinary compost heaps are not hot enough. It's a problem as you say that needs a long term solution 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rowe_tc @ronniegraham4 @Stewchat Yes I did. Understood. Just be easier if nobody ever held guns 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stewchat @rowe_tc Pleased to hear that. You just never know how some people's minds work! 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rowe_tc @Stewchat No, to a large extent I agree. But then we can go down the old line about any use of taxes. I don't have school-age children but my taxes/council tax fund schools etc etc. I don't like the possibility of (more) unlicensed guns washing around.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rowe_tc @Stewchat I have no interest in shotguns and shooting so am playing Devils Advocate. If the licence fee is raised to several hundred pounds, would ppl simply not apply for a licence, just as some ppl drive untaxed / uninsured cars?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2minbeachclean I never fail to be amazed - and highly irritated - by the number of people who manage to drop litter a matter of feet from a bin. It's as tho the bins are invisible.  Rather like putting dirty cups and plates on top of the dishwasher but never quite managing to open the door....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeanthorpeRR Always a joy to see a Red Kite. Thank you - yet again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2minbeachclean @LewisHamilton @ChloeGreen5 Thank you both for taking time to clear up a shocking load of #plastic, to film the clean-up and tweet it to all your followers and more across the planet. It shows that nobody is too grand or famous to do the right thing, no matter how unpleasant that might be. Good on you. 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2minbeachclean Interesting spelling mistake there by the OP - it's actually spelled 'thoughtless'. 🙄 The rest of the activity comprises releasing the balloon, running after it until it lands, then picking it up and popping it into a bin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@msimpsonian @JohnLawArt concurs and has sent me a Wiki link. Interesting stuff, this Thornapple or Jimson weed, 2 of its many names! 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnLawArt Ooh blimey. I think I'll remove it (while wearing gloves!) after reading that lot! @simmonite_dave suggests putting some in my tea 😳😳 but I don't fancy being in an 'altered mental state' for several days!! Next question - compost heap or garden bin ?!?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnLawArt Thank you John. I'll have a read and decide what to do with the plant afterwards! Still a mystery as to where it's come from 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@msimpsonian Right. I'll look it up. But not a clue how it got into my Yorkshire veg plot!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave Well yes. However, before going that far, I'd quite like to know what on earth it is, never mind how it got there!! 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThatTimWalker @BBCr4today He did correct himself immediately but you forgot to mention that. If I got up at 3 am on a regular basis, my brain might not be 100% all the time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've found this growing in the veg patch among the outdoor tomatoes. Large creamy flower and spiky 'fruit' Can anyone ID please?? 😳😳  https://t.co/QMiP5F4yFW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mn_reeder 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Finney62 @2minbeachclean @Surfdome @LessPlasticUK While in Italy last month, we paid a Tourist Tax, just over £1 a night each. Maybe the UK needs to do the same to fund daily cleaning services of such areas. Westminster was heaving with tourists and litter when we visited and it stayed there all weekend 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@richardosman Now here's a question. What happens to all the part-used mini toiletries and soap that are left behind in hotels? Not everyone takes them home. If they're binned, surely there's a better answer?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 I think the folk who name moths are the same bunch who sit all day dreaming up names for paint shades. Some moth names are so enigmatic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eElaineGround @ukhousemartins @_BTO @RobPople When we bought our cottage, the thing that finally sold it to me was the number of birds visiting the feeders. It might well have been the same for your neighbour!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eElaineGround @ukhousemartins @_BTO @RobPople So report him! Sorry for the knee-jerk reaction- easy for me to say, but you have to live next door to him, not me. I'd have been livid.

<|startoftext|>@TimAllwood @RoutledgeSteve They may be doing that, as their renewables plan shows, but I'm not so keen on the international and environmental havoc they're wreaking with their Belt and Road initiative. Sri Lanka alone will rue the day they invited them in.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@louiseatkinson Tomatoes. @sainsburys now use cardboard punnets, albeit in plastic bag. @asda toms are all in unrecyclable plastic punnets in plastic bag. Our @Asda has virtually no loose fruit and veg available and it's all in plastic.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KeepBritainTidy We went to #RyedaleShow last Tues. along with thousands of others. Builders' bags staked open all around the Showground for rubbish. The place was virtually litter-free at the end. Such a straightforward option. Could be paired for rubbish v recycling 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OneHappyRower @2minbeachclean @BBCNews @2minlitterpick @KeepBritainTidy I didn't even know it existed. Or even if I have it on my elderly iPhone 😳😳Aha! I've found it 🚯🚯🚯🚯🚯🚯🙄🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2minbeachclean Am I right to assume that these are straws that are designed to dissolve in the drink as they are flavoured, or do they have a flavoured coating? Whatever, they are totally unnecessary.  Barking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Liz_beth1 When my parents died, I was given the opportunity to write on a card that was tied to a tree in the garden of the funeral home. That was infinitely preferable to releasing a pointless balloon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChithamKatie @2minbeachclean @RoyalMail Yes. We only find single ones. I must admit to being puzzled why they chuck away a load. Surely they're expected to return them to the Sorting Office for later use? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChithamKatie @2minbeachclean @RoyalMail If our posties drop a rubber band, I pass it back to them when I next see them. It's never a problem. Or I keep them to use myself. Try popping them in a bag and posting them in the post box if you don't see your postie.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Wildwood_photos @donnarainey4 @MailOnline @zimmer_donna @Erith_Marshes Our big @asda did the same, removing the coin oojah rather than changing them when the £1 coin changed.

<|startoftext|>@leedsbirder @UoLperegrine @UoL_Sus We passed the Parky building at 09:30 yesterday and 2 of the youngsters were peering down at us from the flat roof. What a sight!! 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@9stan If you decide to challenge it and need a little crowd funding, I think you should let the Twitter community know 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CA_TBoner If one of them were my husband, it'd have been, 'For Gods sake, get changed. You're not going out looking like that!' 🙄🙄😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArabellaSock @2minbeachclean Yes, I thought that too. It SOUNDS like a quick process, but we leaf composters know otherwise. I think the kind term is 'disingenuous'. They rather glossed over the shortage of Helium too ....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@andyhood75 Can you explain why the wheat on the edge of the crop remains green, while wheat further in ripens? It's been puzzling us on our walk around the patch. 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LeedsCC_Help @eatcakeypig @CPRE @Natures_Voice @alexsobel IF?? Have your contractors no idea of where House Martins nest?

<|startoftext|>@gdf1973 @2minbeachclean @Amanita_virosa1 @ZilchUK @sleebubee @dillon_thoms Can I say that not all Primary Schools feel the need for this sentimental balloon claptrap. The school where I volunteer has a Leavers' Assembly and the Y6s prepare and cook a meal/buffet  for parents as a thank you for their support. Far better IMHO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LlangattockPick @2minbeachclean We keep a little stretch of road clear on our walks. Pick up loads of 'energy drink' cans, chucked from cars by people who don't have the energy to put the can in the recycling bin when they get home 🙄🙄😩<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@perilsofbirding This isn't new. It's being happening for at least a couple of years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2minbeachclean No doubt some emotional babble about making memories for their precious children as they 'graduate' from Primary School. No doubt they also wrote a Hope for the Future on the card. Hope it wasn't for a better world.  Sorry for my cynicism but I'm probably not wrong. 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmoneyResists @SecNielsen I would dispute your word 'incredible'. It's all too believable because we've watched these events on our TV screens. I think 'heartbreaking' and 'well-crafted' would be more apposite.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BirdGuides @simmonite_dave @9stan @YorksWildlife It is a very sad affair when an individual is penalised for holding a charity to its obligations. YWT managers failed to adhere to building agreements; he pointed this out and is now banned for 'harassment'. 2800 objectors to the VC. Will we all be banned?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Elizabe33948220 @2minbeachclean It needs adding that apparently the parents had organised it, so a wider audience needed for a bit of environmental education. But don't balloons look pretty ? ( their reaction, not mine!) 🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@midsussexwrp @KeepBritainTidy @Eshcon @ManCityCouncil @CityReuseDepot 2/2 And I'd go so far as imposing a Tourist Tax, as we've just paid in Italy, to help pay for it. St James's Park was 95% tourists last week. London could finance its cleanup several times over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@midsussexwrp @KeepBritainTidy @Eshcon @ManCityCouncil @CityReuseDepot NO bins around Westminster. (Security) Loads of litter left over the weekend with nowhere to bin it. Therefore they need a 24/7 cleanup not just Mon-Fri. Add in a container deposit scheme ASAP as per Norway.  Well that's my opinion. 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@midsussexwrp @KeepBritainTidy @Eshcon @ManCityCouncil @CityReuseDepot We saw a lot of this around Westminster last weekend. The area was thronging with tourists so it wasn't just care-less locals either leaving lunch 'wrappings' or stuffing rubbish into the safety barriers on bridges. It was a sorry sight 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CavendishLucy A tweet of mine from last week. Seen in St James's Park. They've also left swathes unmown 👍  https://t.co/yXaDewrh3p<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Was that you on your bike this morning? I was on my way to a meeting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2/2. Not happening at the moment, obviously, or I'd have phoned. But worrying nonetheless as it's pretty inaccessible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WYFRS Are you aware of the grass fires in the field between Wakefield Asda and Pugneys CP? There have been several over recent weeks but have become much more extensive in last couple of days. Photos available if needed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Right. I thought I recognised you this lunchtime by Calder Park, but obviously not you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder @CroftonBirder @MyWakefield I saw one a couple of years ago below the castle when I was on a wander with young Daragh. Since then, sadly, nothing, despite keeping my ears open.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Were you wearing navy blue today? 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder @MyWakefield Grey Partridge steady here. Spooked a Mum and 7 juveniles the other day when checking on the 3 Kestrel juv's. They've even returned to the scraggy field behind Asda. No sign of Yellowhammer though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder @MyWakefield I'll send you photos later today for your advice if that's ok?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder @MyWakefield There have been lots at times feeding over Asdale Road in particular, but nowhere near numbers of previous years. They haven't hung around either. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder Before you put up the boxes, did you have prospecting Swifts? We seem to have had none over the house so how to attract them? Play calls and if so, how? We used to have HMs nesting years ago but nothing now.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GranthamEcology @southkesteven @LincolnshireCC @GranthamMatters Quite frankly, I'm appalled that the town in which I was born has the effrontery not to mow roadside verges to within an inch of their lives and thus allow such scenes to occur.

<|startoftext|>@ceeste45 When you've decided, and I think it's a Holly Blue, it's the same as the one in our garden in Sandal this afternoon, and a couple I saw in the field behind Asda yesterday. Don't usually see Blues round here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarraghHudson You've been very quiet lately! What are you up to?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RSPB_OldMoor What an organised way of reporting sightings! Impressed 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pwookey Some of his other stuff is as offensive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spurnbirdobs @wilgils But will you be serving scones, carrot cake and a nice lemon drizzle? 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Just another reason for not reading this rag. As the Times pointed out, Trump didn't get the full works. No Charles, William, Kate, Harry who all refused to meet him. No speech to MPs in the HoC. It's just a horrid excuse for a paper but folk continue to buy it 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Overheard in Asda on the salad aisle. 'Oh no! They haven't got any of those ready-cooked hard-boiled eggs! What am I gonna do now? '  Ermmmm......<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SedatedFMS @Pwookey @simmonite_dave I know there's no easy answer. Deposit scheme for drinks containers can't come soon enough.

<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder @andyhood75 @spurnbirdobs @RareBirdAlertUK Yes, probably. That or their wives saying, 'Off you go for the day, luv, and give me a bit o' peace and quiet' 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andyhood75 @spurnbirdobs @RareBirdAlertUK Twitching is a predominately male activity. Discuss. Got to be a PhD thesis there, surely. 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EileensWonders @riddlededum @Pwookey @simmonite_dave There was a massive number of cans/bottles. I understand why no bins in the high security area around Westminster but if that's the case, they need 24/7 collections as in many European cities. It looked embarrassingly uncared for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Tern also on Reserve lake at #Pugneys with 4 Little Egret 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @WakeyBirders @wakeynats There's a surprise. Most folk don't give a proverbial about the bird life. Their dog is way more important 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BiologistDan . @simon_reeve covered this in his BBC series on the Indian Ocean. If it reappears on iPlayer, it's worth watching.

<|startoftext|>@benclunie @donnarainey4 Worth pulling up if you have horses. Otherwise....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@riddlededum @Pwookey @simmonite_dave Might make it easier for others to clear up. In central London last weekend - hot weather, no bins, cans and bottles stuffed into all the protective barriers on the bridges. But then not cleared away till Monday. Not a good look 😳😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pwookey @simmonite_dave Shocking, but where are the bins? They need some big wheelie bins like we see in Spain and Italy. No excuse them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_mhaley4 @jonnybirder Can I suggest, as a retired teacher, that he approaches it with circumspection. He should find a school he'd be happy to work in and ask to shadow for a week at least. A friend gave up his IT job to teach Maths and hated it. Not what he'd expected at all.

<|startoftext|>@missmagpirate Yes. Ours had a definite pale grey underside rather than buff. And a beautiful blue.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Mark13434035 @HughsWaronWaste @StarbucksUK Only if they all use Vegware. It needs composting at a higher heat than domestic compost so needs to go to a specialist compost site. If they all used it, things would be easier.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@The_RHS Thank you. Have you also considered that some members would be quite happy not to receive a magazine? I'm afraid I rarely read mine properly and would be prepared to pay a smaller subscription for Garden Access only.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donnarainey4 @wildfullstop You're probably right. Instructed and trained by people without the proper qualifications. Goggles, gloves and boots required. Understanding not required. Now get out there and kill those weeds. People like tidy. 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KenChurcher In that case, all I can suggest is either put them in the household bin (not much goes to landfill - it gets incinerated) or save them up for someone who does have a compost bin. I'm surprised yr Council doesn't give food waste bins to flats with no access to composting bins🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wildfullstop @donnarainey4 It's akin to handing me the keys to a 5 star hotel and saying, you've stayed in a B and B before. Get on and run this. And no I'm not going to train you. Just get on and do what you think is best. You'll be fine. 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KenChurcher Your block of flats needs some sort of compost bin! Is there a nearby public garden where one could be sited? Just wondering. Some people would use it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wildfullstop @donnarainey4 Council workers are given sprayers and instructions. They carry them out mindlessly. No thought to, or understanding for, the environment. And the instructions come from people who most certainly can't be trained ecologists. It's madness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wilgils He's the ultimate Loose Cannon.  He seems to be missing the switch most of us have in our brain, which tells us when something is appropriate or not. Pity the Queen no longer has a Corgi which could savage his ankles. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fr_AWilkes @martinRSPB @Natures_Voice @The_RHS Are there any plans to do this with The Garden magazine? It's a no-brainer.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WildlifeInWakey @BBCSpringwatch Rather like my daughter, they go instinctively towards the most expensive stuff 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder And Magpies and Crows. So that's alright then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donnarainey4 Winging its way to you... 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donnarainey4 If you DM me your email address I'll forward you a copy of my email to Highways England re their mowing protocols.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elizset @schtinkhousen @mcsuk If you have 5 minutes, watch the final 5 mins of this evening's BBC1 10pm News. You'll see what happens to plastics in some Asian countries. The beach shown in Mumbai is heartbreaking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@schtinkhousen @elizset @mcsuk Ah. It says 'managed' not recycled. According to the info officer at our local 'tip', the awkward plastics are sent to  a nearby power station as fuel. That's managing it I suppose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elizset @schtinkhousen @mcsuk You don't know, I don't know. It's a problem for the planet. And there's too many vested interests producing gas and oil to make yet more plastic cos it makes them and their shareholders £££$$$€€€$$$$<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lil_Richardjohn @donnarainey4 I'm not anti- mow. I'm against flowering plants being cut before they've finished providing nectar for insects, and before seeding. It's all about timing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@schtinkhousen @elizset @mcsuk  https://t.co/BtXjPzVjuk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@schtinkhousen @elizset @mcsuk Compared to some other countries, we do have proper recycling facilities. We don't simply chuck stuff either into landfill or into the nearest river. Some escapes, but v little by comparison. So it is dealt with, though whether it's ideal is a matter of conjecture.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenWhisker Mrs Milburn here from school. Mr M and I were wondering what you were doing, post-Oxford?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elizset @schtinkhousen @mcsuk The 5 rivers which sweep plastic waste into the oceans are in Asia. We supply them with plastic but not the wherewithal to build recycling facilities. And China has the know how but isn't doing the biz. It needs to get its sh!t together.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RareBirdAlertUK @Team4Nature300 @ravenmaster1 @scotgp @natalieben @gordonjbuchanan @ShetlandWild @nature_scot @Protect_Wldlife @onekindtweet We were really pleased to hear the 'cronk' of a pair of Raven while climbing Ben More on Mull last weekend. Fantastic birds which then had a pop at a Sea Eagle. Spectacular! Leave them be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RSPBAireValley It was so good to see a familiar 'patch' on TV. Good to see it from the air too. Even non-birding OH was impressed especially by the historical references. Looking forward to seeing Oddball tonight 🤗🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donnarainey4 I'll be polite. I always find it helps. I'll let you know how I get on 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donnarainey4 Tweeted query re mowing policy to Highways this evening. See very prompt reply. Will be emailing tomorrow 🤔🙂  https://t.co/P8CcVyaA4J<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HighwaysYORKS Gosh. Wasn't expecting a reply so quickly! I'll email tomorrow. Thank you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HighwaysYORKS Hi. What is your policy on grass-cutting along the M1/A1 link? Some stretches have been left blooming beautifully; others have been totally scalped by the 'robot' mowers. Could they not be left until after seeding? The Cowslips were chopped far too early, sadly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donnarainey4 Safe enough apparently for grass cutting teams to go in with their mega robot mowers, but no doubt too dangerous to allow a botanist to poke around! But the Ox-eyes are billowing, buttercups aplenty and poppies too. They really don't need strimming #MotorwayMeadows<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donnarainey4 Some of the motorway verges (some!!) on the M1/A1 link are covered in Wildflowers. I wonder what a botanist would find, given the opportunity to have a close examination. When you think how many acres are left uncultivated -they could be treasure troves. #MotorwayMeadows<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehappypear @waitrose Yay! More plastic packaging.  How about rethinking that aspect? Hummus has always been dairy free BTW.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CABS_REPORTS Thank you for doing all this. I'd like to think we in the UK were looking out for our birds to the best of our ability, but there's a long way to go. Stay safe. #IllegalHunting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LevingeJulie @mikegalsworthy @Wintersett1 There was so little genuine, in-depth info given, pre Ref. Cameron barely got out of bed with it, convinced Remain would win. And Labour hardly roused themselves either. The level of debate was poor, but no-one really knew what was coming. We do now. Too late.  ?? #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PCPink1995 Trust his beloved car goes to the squasher. 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@borobarrister Miss Willmott, C19 gardener, used to secretly sprinkle Eryngium Giganteum seed in friends' gardens. Plant now known as Miss Willmott's Ghost. Maybe you have friends with very large gardens? Or just Sheffield otherwise 😳🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Naturanotitia @ceeste45 Watch till the end. That's the way to do it!! Well done, Mum. 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@footballforfans @mikegalsworthy @Wintersett1 For such a monumental decision, the info given beforehand was utterly inadequate. The Establishment never thought it would happen, so didn't dig deep enough into the implications. I feel we voted blindfold, not by our own fault. I'm for Ref2 because of the above.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RSPB_OldMoor Are you interested? A little 'weight' might help 🤔  https://t.co/7949vSocLt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can anyone ID these eggs please? Nest found accidentally by a friend on Lunga (off Mull) By his description, the 2 birds 'leading him away'  were probably either Twite or Linnet. He took pic and left the birds to it. Nest quite low down.  https://t.co/tkXdbw3U4Q<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikegalsworthy @Wintersett1 I'm of the opinion the we voted for a pig in a poke. We didn't understand the ramifications of our decision; neither side provided the full facts. It's only now that the issues are becoming clearer. We need a second vote. Knowledge is power. #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gannetrocks @Wintersett1 @SteelySeabirder @davehPars @ForthEstuary Following all your hot, dry weather then heavy rain, it could well be plant based. The air in N Yorks was thick with pollen and fluffy tree seeds yesterday. I've seen it lying like snow some days.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@donnarainey4 I totally agree. There seems to be no thought or understanding in some Councils about the ramifications of verge cutting for biodiversity. Maybe @michaelgove can give this his consideration?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ukhousemartins HMs sighted over Marton near Kirkbymoorside yesterday evening with Swifts. No sign of occupied nests nearby. Will put a note on village notice board requesting nesting information 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobGMacfarlane We planted a Hawthorn hedge last year and included Hazels and Dog Roses. Still waiting for the flowers oop North 🌺🌺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donnarainey4 The #M1 link to the A1 is a case in point. Some sections of embankment are in full bloom - oxeyes, b'cups, the lot. Others have been 100% scalped, with others mown on lower section, using massive 'robot' mowers. Team out today. Utterly pointless and infuriating. Why??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@remain_central @simmonite_dave I do feel that the UK went into the Referendum blindfold. Major issues and problems which were never discussed are coming to light. We now know better what is ahead. We are better informed. Time for a rethink IMHO. #PigInAPoke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillOddie It seems to depend where you live. Swifts in Keswick, other villages along A66, Kirkbymoorside, Wakefield. Swallows likewise. Just not lots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Attenboroughs_D You don't need to see the bloke's head to know what his expression is 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WildlifeInWakey There are Swallows nesting at Castle Farm as per usual, but numbers down I think. Also see Swifts over Asdale Rd mid afternoon regularly. Couple of dozen usually. Not hundreds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@digitalocean I haven't a clue what any of this means. Blocked<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@waitrose Lemon or raspberries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder @RoutledgeSteve @Twitter So I wonder if they're moving from individual email ads to blanket tweets? I'll ask my data-savvy daughter when I see her tomorrow evening 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder @RoutledgeSteve @Twitter All I know is I should be getting a lot fewer emails from companies I can't even remember signing up for. But I've removed over 20 Twitter ads today alone. 😡😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Seasaver @Nike Sadly, a lost football there I think, rather than pollution. Fish it out and pass it on to some kids to play with.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RoutledgeSteve @Twitter Not just me then! Have gone for ages with just the odd ad then suddenly I'm deleting loads 🤔🤔🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BroadlandPolice @RareBirdAlertUK So what do you do with the eggs now? I know they should be disposed of, but it seems a shame to destroy such little pieces of perfection. And sadly, not one egg per species, but a clutch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DickKingSmith We had a cat that did this whenever she sat on someone's knee. My Dad used to call it 'plodging'. 🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peta @ceeste45 £££££ $$$$$$$ €€€€€€€ That's why they do it. The fur should just be combed out, but that doesn't produce enough. Just avoid #Angora products. If you want exotic wool, go for Alpaca instead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley  https://t.co/fZb7KRzxXg Should've done this earlier, sorry. Gov response is lower down the page.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley Totally agree. Fast food places need to realise they can sell burgers to kids without an added #balloon as a start. The resulting images of wildlife need more public exposure. Cue #Countryfile and other popular programmes. They need to show the nasty side as well as the cute.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley Just had automated reply from Govt re balloon petition. As they are not in the top 10/20 of Marine/Inland litter and cause relatively few incidents, no need to amend 2013 law. So no action. I paraphrase.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomCee54 @BakerBoySOG @CJBridge @RSPBintheEast @ukrbbp Come and see what a transformation has been made of the Dearne Valley around Barnsley and Rotherham. Massive changes. Look at the Bittern numbers here. #OldMoor #Adwick #Broomhill<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Sadly, I'm not surprised. There's little there to suggest it's (partially) a Nature Reserve. Dogs, canoes - what next??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoutledgeSteve @SittingByTheSea I've reacted to the ones with whom I need to retain contact. Otherwise it's cleared out a lot off dross from my emails 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mn_reeder @ChrisGPackham @missmagpirate If the trees were really in need of felling, then maybe a notice explaining why, or outlining proposals, would have been a good idea. The Council knows itself to be in the firing line re its trees. This just adds grist to the proverbial mill. 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@borobarrister @BirdwatchExtra National Trust is now sending their magazine in a potato-starch bag, not plastic. If you cut the bag open carefully, it makes a good veg-peelings compost bag. They tell you to compost it, not throw it in the bin. At least they're doing that bit right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisGPackham @missmagpirate Chris- you've hit the parody Gove Twitter account. You need @michaelgove instead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisGPackham @missmagpirate This just beggars belief. The trees were not lifting road or pavement, nor damaging buildings. They provided shade, oxygen, reduced CO2, and looked good. Local Gov is run by environmental illiterates and vandals #Sheffield #Labour #Amey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GlasgowAlbum @Bird_Crime Sri Lanka is replacing rubber plantations with Palm. They are not expanding or deforesting. As latecomers, they have taken a strict line on this. They know that tourism, their major earner, is at stake. #PalmOil<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Can I make a plea that if you book a B&amp;B this summer, you do so directly with them, rather than via a Booking app. The 15% commission they pay is a large chunk of their profit. Many are struggling to stay in business. Pick up the phone instead 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cristo_burton That's good to know. Some shocking stuff going on out there re forced labour. Always good to check.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@andysims4049 @PatchBirding @Lincsbirding @lincsbirders @LincsNaturalist We've driven from Keswick to near Helmsley i.e. across U.K.  Screaming Swifts in Keswick + Swallows feeding over fields. Sandies too. Swifts over places on A66. Screaming Swifts and Swallows here in NYorks. No sign of HMs yet though....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cristo_burton Just a little concerned that they're working those hours in the light of last week's report on forced labour, where Romanians topped the list as being worst affected 🤔🤔Not saying you're doing the forcing, obviously, but there's a lot going on.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JimAshton_ I really can't say why, Jim, as in this case surely they'd save ££ by not strimming. A team of blokes with 2 massive radio-controlled mowers. The grass etc on the banking isn't an obstruction to vision or safe driving 🤔🤔🙄🙄<|endoftext|>

Marvellous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrotherBikini In what way did we pay for Ms Markle's dress? Just wondering. My understanding is that Her Maj is paying for the wedding, and Police security, as ever, is paid for by the taxpayer. The Dress is no doubt an 'arrangement' between the designer and the bride.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MickgCunningham @Bucktonbirder Needs saying though. It can be very frustrating especially if you're trying to decide where to spend your day/morning most profitably 🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MickgCunningham I have emailed several reserves about poor sightings-updates. I have been told that some post a regular sightings list on Twitter, but it's not always the case.

<|startoftext|>@LadyNaturalist @StevieD131 @IndyCar @INFishWildlife @OhioDivWildlife @IMS @mbalter @GCBL @NPR @ohioseagrant @scifri @FinsUnited Also needs mentioning is the fact that Helium is an increasingly scarce resource, needed far more for medical purposes than for frivolous balloons.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@borobarrister @JonathanMPomroy I'll have a look to see what we can do. Your house is doubtless bigger than our wee cottage. The House Sparrows do nest under the tiles on the roof where the protective oojahs are missing 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@borobarrister @JonathanMPomroy Can either of you suggest best height or orientation for the Sparrow boxes please?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonathanMPomroy Right. I'll investigate. There's all sorts nesting at our neighbour Bill's place. He has a warren of open sided workshops/barns/wood stores. Tawny Owl apparently roosting too, judging by the pellets. Deep joy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonathanMPomroy Quick advice then - where best to source swift boxes?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Barnsleybsg Bitterns in Barnsley! Who'd 'a thought it! My Barnsley-lad OH is well chuffed that the scrappy area he played on as a kid is now such a fantastic reserve. Well done to all concerned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hudsonweather Commented to OH that there were some on the car windscreen, which is unusual. Stand back for a Blue Tit frenzy, cos they love 'em.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonathanMPomroy Could do with DM-ing you for advice re Tree Sparrow boxes. We have a colony of a dozen or so at the cottage in Marton and would be only too happy to put up boxes.<|endoftext|>

The elder further down is done every 2 years to keep it as a hedge. It looks grim but the farmer knows what he's doing fortunately. He proper pruned the big trees about 8 wks ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ottocrat @Wintersett1 Then they need a new system. We ring at 8:30. The triage nurse either offers advice or an appointment that day at one of 2 surgeries. Have never had to wait longer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NationalGallery @carl_thompson70 If I thought that paying big money for a ticket would give me uninterrupted views, I'd go. However, other London major art exhibitions have resembled a scrum. You sell far too many tickets to make it a pleasant experience. 😕😕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mn_reeder @MikePennington2 @mick_turton I'd kill for a garden that big 😳😳😳<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@INethercoat @Wintersett1 @networkrail We travelled by train between Wakefield and Liverpool this week.

<|startoftext|>@Clickbeetle85 @simmonite_dave I won't say exactly what I think but it's along the lines of if you live in a city, you may not think along wildlife lines.  Surely a flowering cherry, which is currently in flower, would be a better memorial? But it's not instant. 🙄🙄.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VanDutchmanXXX @OpinionYP @yorkshirepost @Wintersett1 Err no. We Brits seem to be "litter blind". We don't need anyone else to show us how to drop litter. 🙄😳<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@yorkshirepost @Wintersett1 The A64 is shocking for the amount of litter among the verges. There are at least 2 front ends of cars in the grass that have been there for weeks. Lay-bys with no bins but tons of rubbish. Yorkshire roads are indeed a sea of plastic, bottles, cans and other cr@p. Dispiriting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Treespers42 @simmonite_dave School where I volunteer had 6 eggs provided 3 yrs ago, with suitable incubator &amp; 'accommodation'.

<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @Wintersett1 I have asked our local Councillor to investigate as I can't find any application for planning permission online. Correct me please if there is one. I emailed him last week but have heard nothing as yet. I'll keep you posted, Alex.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikerendle Ravens are rarely seen hereabouts. I see more when I go to Mallorca. The thought of 'disposing' of them for the benefit of grouse shooters is unbelievable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CartoonRalph @Inglorious_book @jeanthorpeRR @nature_scot @birdersagainst @BirdGuides @britishbirds @BC_Scotland @BTO_Scotland @JonnyEcology @PlantlifeScot @ScotWildlife @theSNP @scotgov @scotgp It is, and Ravens are often included under the same.

<|startoftext|>@mick_turton @simmonite_dave They seem to have had a slip of Autocorrect. It says 'waders' by mistake, when they really meant 'grouse'. 🙄🙄.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2minbeachclean @McDonalds So, to be clear. When #Asda eg say they will massively reduce plastic use, to what are they referring? Their own brand items? Their fruit n veg wrappers? Plastic used in transport? Certainly not every item they stock, I imagine🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SwillyBirder Was it you whom I asked to confirm my 'sighting'? I was so pleased I was right!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 I came across a pair of Grey Partridge on the field edge the other day when it was really hot, but nothing else of note. I'll try again then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 So now that the Wheatear field has been bulldozered, where's the next best place to look? And are the Yellow Wags hanging around the car park as last year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Was very pleased to see Osprey over St Aidans this morning. And even more pleased that I'd ID-ed it correctly when it was only a distant blob 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/grlohaqXf5. Well done to #Balterzens in Harrogate on a brave stand. Let's hope customers support them rather than going elsewhere. It's got to be the future 🤔👍#PointlessPlastic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tascosa1 @BiologistDan The sad thing is that most non-First World countries don't have waste facilities beyond rubbish tips. We in the West make stuff, export it and give not a thought about the packaging that results. Wind and water does this rest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YorkshireTea It's not the online shopping I was commenting on - I do it myself. It was yet another plastic unnecessary that I was despairing of. 🙄#PointlessPlastic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tascosa1 @BiologistDan You could clear it up today and it would soon revert to this state because of its position in the ocean's currents. It's how it is because of where it is, sadly.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@amias @OregonJOBS2 @strlen It does say native plant seed, so I'm assuming it's not necessarily tree seed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoutledgeSteve Can I just say he's more used to Barnsley and Worksop Town (it's a long story) so the bright lights of Anfield were a bit of a treat 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoutledgeSteve He was with a friend who's the Liv fan &amp; who had a spare ticket. I went along to Liv and spent the evening with friend's missus. The chaps thought it all seemed quite unthreatening and were very shocked to discover how close they'd been to the sudden violence. Scary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimAshton_ I always look out for the chalky embankments at the side of A1 North of Leeds this time of year. Covered in #Cowslips. Assume the seed is dispersed by vehicle slip streams? 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobGMacfarlane It's the same thing when I come across a word I've not met before. Suddenly that word pops up again a day or 2 later. Very odd 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoutledgeSteve My OH was at the game and was outside the pub where the Liv fan was attacked minutes after. It appears to be the Roma fans who were 'tooled up'. I had been in the centre an hour earlier and had to jump into shop when a large group of Roma fans swept thru. Quite frightening.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 What's this about an Alpine Swift??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning I struggle to see why manufacturers try to mimic meat products. Surely it's highly processed, which is something many people, including me, try to avoid wherever possible. And even more so if you're veggie, either for the good of your health or to avoid animal slaughter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very sad to read about the death of Matt Campbell during the #LondonMarathon. We watched him cook on #ProfessionalMasterchef and were impressed with his skills, imagination and ideas. Not just that, but he seemed a thoroughly Good Bloke. 😟<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoutledgeSteve Good luck with that. #Wakefield finds every excuse not to act. Ongoing battle for last year with fly tipping next to #Pugneys. It's been going round 3 different agencies with no action. Just growing 😡😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nadiafo68846427 @YoloBirder Yes I understand yr point. More the labelling I was querying. There's difference I know btw flavoured/flavouring. But this is called Gammon &amp; patently it isn't. Maybe 'You wouldn't believe it's not Gammon ' is required 🙄🙄Surprised Trading Standards haven't jumped on it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobGMacfarlane One so far, sitting on the phone wire by the farm where they nest in the old buildings. #Wakefield. Lots of Sandies though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaelgove I disagree.  The whole pre-Brexit debate, both sides, was, in retrospect, pathetically lacking in information to allow for a proper informed vote.  Most voters hadn't a clue about what the CU is, never mind understanding the implications of leaving it. 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder @RoutledgeSteve Signed, young man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@titianlocks @BirdLife_Malta @VisitMalta Well you know why that would be. Much more fun to shoot them, apparently.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's in English on iplayer. Eve learned Welsh to play the part; each scene was filmed in English then again in Welsh ( or viceversa). #KeepingFaith<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you enjoy watching a good thriller on TV, may I recommend #KeepingFaith on BBC iplayer. 8 episodes of cracking drama with Eve Myles. Originally on Welsh SC4 and for some reason not on BBC1/2. We've been hooked to it. Best thing we've seen in ages 👍👍<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Sven_Wair @rob_yaxley @idontbakecakes @michaelgove Not generally a problem as the trees are usually at the side of the path.... 😱😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley @idontbakecakes @michaelgove If there are, the concept has not, as yet, reached Wakefield. Some (too many!) dog owners love their dog but don't want the responsibility of clearing up properly after them. #Revolting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@idontbakecakes @rob_yaxley @michaelgove What do you mean "Then there'd just be...". There already is!! I did a 2 hour litterpick last Fri and there were dozens of bags in the undergrowth and on trees. This despite fact there are dog bins 200 yards away. Those bags will be there 4ever. #PLasticpollution<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@borobarrister We climbed Whernside a fortnight ago with #Curlew calls accompanying us. Several individuals mobile in the surrounding moorland. Beautiful noise 🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley The next thing @michaelgove needs to implement is to require dogpoo bags to be made from potato-starch degradable material. There must be millions of poobags littering countryside and towns alike. 😡😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wilgils I'm still struggling with the 1.3 million figure. Value for money??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scubacyclist Me too. And bloody funny looks you get too! 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scubacyclist Pop down to Scarborough Marine Drive for the #Peregrine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AsdaServiceTeam Thank you. I've just walked down to the beck and the trolleys have been collected 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirdLife_Malta And I'll say it again, @VisitMalta. Here's why my family won't be booking a holiday in Malta. #IllegalSpringHunting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AsdaServiceTeam Thank you Kathy. I'll have a walk down later. The decision not to replace the pound coin slots on the trolleys has meant that numerous trolleys are taken offsite. They are regularly dumped in the stream and nobody will fish them out. It's a real problem 🙄😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AsdaServiceTeam I'll enjoy my day. The store manager will do nothing to help. He did nothing last year bar pass my letter on. He needs to engage #Trolleywise ASAP. The trolleys roam far and wide, sadly. Sorry to be cynical but it's past experience 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AsdaServiceTeam @Trolleywise No they can't. As far as I know Asda Wakefield is not signed up to Trolleywise. We went thru this endlessly last year. Currently SIX trolleys around the Country Park area. The trolley collectors need to fetch them. I took one back yesterday myself 😡😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AsdaServiceTeam Hi. Have tried ringing store but no option for customer service. Please advise Wakefield store 2 trolleys on path by. beck. Cross field behind recycling then cross next then trolleys straight ahead 50yds past bridge. Also 3 in stream 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder @JohonSchepe @Wintersett1 @mhemingway25 @DarraghHudson As @jonnybirder used to say, I'd need a passport. May well have to apply for one ! #Pugneys #Wintersett<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lakeslandlord I think I may have to call in to your establishment next time we're up walking in the Lakes. OH completing his Wainwrights shortly so might be an excuse 🤔🎂🍰🍸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder It's worse than my phone pic can show. That whole area gone. The little Snipe pond is still there, I think, but surrounded by spoil heaps. I could've cried. 😢😢What an utter mess and wipeout.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeamEveMyles Heard your interview on #WomansHour and decided to watch. OH and I now totally hooked; best thing we've seen in ages. Final episode tomorrow night 😳😳 Roll on series 2. Fantastic telly. Thank you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave Peel Estates are draconian. If you use the road through their commercial estate and stop for any reason, there's a £100 fine. So if OH drops me off so I can visit the Wetland, I get out at Pugneys and take my life in my hands to cross the dual carriageway. 🙄#CCTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ceeste45 @Wintersett1 Well sadly, that token area is all that's going to remain, Carl. I assume you've picked up the hoo-ha about the shooting range next to #Pugneys? That'll do wonders for wildlife.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning Peel? Are you expecting a response? Let me know if you get one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning I thought you must by other tweets. The big car showroom is horrendous and at night it's serious light pollution too. Won't be many Blyth's Pipits around there now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wintersett1 It's far worse than it looks on the photo. A huge devastated area. As I stood there, a pair of Grey Partridge flew from the hedge at one side. Better not be breeding there 😥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning I could cry when I see this. It's not that long ago that the whole area was fields and horses. And now every square metre will be buildings, carparks and roads. The price to pay for being next to M1 J39 I suppose 😥😥<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jcq1113 @Wintersett1 @RoyalMail I agree. That's why I suggested posting them in the box. The postie will have to collect them then. I must admit, the food and drink waste litter round here is a far bigger problem all round, beyond all help really. At least I can pick up every odd band I see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimAshton_ We have a little place near Kirkbymoorside but sadly not up there today as friends are in. Otherwise I'd have called in to say hello. We get FAR more butterflies up there than in Wakefield.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jcq1113 @Wintersett1 @RoyalMail Just pick them up and reuse them yourself or hand them back to your postie. Or post them in the nearest postbox. That might be a polite reminder rather than confrontational. We love our 2 posties and would be happy to have a word with them if it happened here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankRGardner I've no idea Frank. But is there any way that Twitter can silence Trump? His kneejerk tweets reveal clearly his lack of perception, thought, imagination, clarity, diplomacy, foresight, gravitas. He terrifies the Bejesus out of me. His grandstanding with Putin is truly frightening<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeMonbiot @Steveredwolf As Churchill said, 'Jaw jaw is better than War war'. Or words to that effect. Could someone explain that to May, Trump, Putin, Macron, Assad ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mn_reeder @bethreeder_ "Passed"??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steveredwolf My thoughts exactly. I walked home this aft past so many discarded wrappers, crisp bags, 'paper' cups, cans, bottles etc. For the manufacturers, it's 'out of sight, out of mind'. As long as they sell the stuff, it's 'bugger the consequences'. Nearly all plastic, obviously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonny09Jonny Well that's one #TurtleDove that won't reach the UK. Remind me why I won't be booking a holiday in #Malta? @VisitMalta<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steveredwolf I despair. I really do. As a nation - and I say this with confidence because I drive all over the country and see all the cr@p thrown out of cars- we are Litter-Blind and totally Care-less . 😡😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder And as for birding, we #Pugneys birders might as well hang up the bins for good. #Buggered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder Their website gives Asdale Rd next to Pugneys. Take a look. Main road, heavy traffic, huge Asda, big school, busy country park, nature reserve. What a place to set this up. It's madness. Never mind the noise we won't be able to block out from our house 😡😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder I've just picked up this info about a shooting range next to #Pugneys. I'm beyond livid. Seems like a done deal according to the website. Have emailed local councillors but not holding breath. Nothing on WMDC Planning website that I can find 😡😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WakeExpress What?? Don't local residents get chance of an opinion?? First thing we knew!?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And no, that isn't a shark's fin rapidly approaching the bridge, just the corner of a wooden table that's been dumped @MyWakefield<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that was another lovely walk this morning @MyWakefield. Really lifted my spirits 😡😡Yet more #FlyTipping in the usual place. Beck by Portobello. Enough garbage to fill a truck. #Infuriating  https://t.co/zPVo9urfAY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The sooner there's a Deposit Scheme for plastic bottles, the better. This lot stranded along beck at #Pugneys after flooding. Far too muddy to climb down to clear. Next stop R Calder and the North Sea 🙄🙄 #PlasticPollution #Despair  https://t.co/ZGLpOEYsid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2minbeachclean My daughter works for a large corp with several big offices. The Manc office has removed disposable water cups and given each employee a logo-ed water bottle   She went to a joint meeting in London last week and now they all want it doing. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobGMacfarlane That's me then. Always bring a stone or pebble home from every holiday visit. Wish I could remember where they're all from! #lithophile<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulTomlinsonn @MickgCunningham Presumably it's a potential casualty of the planners' mega Oxbridge conurbation. What does Mr Gove have to say about this? Maybe he needs inviting to see the site. @michaelgove @RSPBNews #Otmoor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave @davidhunt100 I tried to tell him that his feeding the gulls encouraged them to target humans and he shrugged. So I suggested that young kids wouldn't find them as easy to deal with. So he walked off. Tw@t. Pardon my language.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_BTO @BirdTrack Be honest- where would you rather be? Southern Spain or here? Was in Sicily last year in June, with literally thousands of #ScreamingSwifts in every town we visited. Did wonder why any bothered moving further north 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidhunt100 @simmonite_dave If humans were more thoughtful about their rubbish, and dropping takeaway food leftovers, then Herring gulls would stop seeing us as 'providers'. Asked a bloke in Scarboro to stop feeding chips to a gull. He refused and said it didn't do any harm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@haveigotnews It reminds me of my late Ma after FB had been in general use for a while. "Hilary, what's a face book?" When I told her she'd need a computer to get one, she lost interest 🙄#sensible<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FrankRGardner Isn't it reassuring that Donald uses such restrained and considered language that reflects his thought processes. 🤔🤔😱😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Protect_Wldlife @simmonite_dave Please read up about Sri Lankan palm oil. POil doesn't just come from Indonesia. SL is replacing existing rubber and coconut plantations with PO as it is more financially viable. However, no forest or jungle has been or will be cut - only existing land is repurposed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HughHarrop @ShetIslandsCll @KIMOUKandFFL @ScottishSeas @2minbeachclean @LessPlasticUK @Fishing4Litter @Oceanwarrior @SeabirdCentre @TheSeabirdGroup @klondyker @NaeStrawAtAw These need to be available near or on every beach in the UK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder I wouldn't have known what it was. It looks like what it is - a plastic bottle with a stick through the middle. I'd have probably thought it was rubbish and fished it out. Could do with an explanatory label attached 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YorkshireTea Tearesa might do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waitrose Thank you! I should've put my head round the kitchen door but they were very busy 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pigeon_Kill Now that would improve viewing figures. Or even more so if it were Farage et al providing lion fodder 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pigeon_Kill Bread and Circuses. That's what the Roman Emperors knew kept their citizens happy 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyedalePolice Please don't let certain media outlets deter you from tweeting. It's the best way for your 'constituents' to see what you're dealing with on a daily basis 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley He's the sort of farmer that you want every farmer to be. Talking to him about the effects and benefits of Spring sowing was fascinating. Improved soil structure, weeds, insects, birds, small mammals, owls, raptors. Obvious really. Circle of Life 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeWantPlates @tanner_ism STOP. IT. NOW.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_BTO @MarkCocker2 @_AndyClements The book had an excellent write up in this week's Sunday Times. A scary read, I think, though. Not a good prognosis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley Did a bread making course at #SideOvenBakery nr Driffield last week. Organic farm growing wheat, spelt and iron corn. Tim leaves the sowing until spring. Winter weeds+stubble=more birds. Inspiring set up. Just needs some sunshine now! #CarrHouseFarm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waitrose One for you to investigate pls. Leeds Meanwood cafe sells Middle Eastern Wild Rice salad, also available in store. But what is the delicious dressing? Is it also available to buy off the shelf?? 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirdwatchExtra I had to go to Mallorca to hear #Nightingales. Wonder when the last time was that one was heard singing in Berkeley Square as per the song?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pigeon_Kill @YoloBirder Love the reason given by the bloke for not catching it 🙂😂😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Waitrose to remove all disposable coffee cups from shops this year  https://t.co/tSPIrGCJHA Another step in the right direction. My #keepcup lives in my handbag so I'll be OK #smug 🙂🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeanthorpeRR How did she die? I was watching a Peregrine perched on the cliff side on Marine Drive in January. Several passers by asked for a look through the bins too and were thrilled by the unexpected sight. Sad to see this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmmaJESD @FrankRGardner On the news this morning. They've taken her to a safe house. Not going to publicise that and have the Sun reporters following her 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisGPackham @Wintersett1  https://t.co/vHbWE98B3o An interesting read. Sri Lanka is replacing rubber and coconut plantations with POil but in a sustainable and care-ful manner. If the stuff is here to stay, this is how it should be done 🤔No virgin jungle allowed to be cut.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Duncbye @YorkBirding Noooooo!!! 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkAvery @RaptorPersScot How very convenient 🙄🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Duncbye @YorkBirding @LDV_NNR Oo er! That sounds rather odd. Never been told off by a farmer for "looking in his field". Makes you wonder what he's up to!?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ianbennell75 @9stan I'll drive you. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wilgils An interesting read on several levels. If you're a Spurn visitor, why would you not want to get your shoes dirty? What are you being led to expect? A totter down a tarmac path in stilettos with a cinnamon latte for afters? #Spurn #YWT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Staggered up Whernside this morning, accompanied by a load of Skylarks, numerous Mipits and several Curlew. 🤗🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bighouseburning @ChrisGPackham Go to Jersey Zoo set up by the late Gerald Durrell. Visit the Lemurs which live in the woodland, totally free. They know where they are fed and the warm shelter sheds so stick around. Amazing. The Orang Utan 'enclosure' is state of the art. Rather that than being butchered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wilgils @9stan It's difficult to deal with angry dog-owners by yourself. Hopefully there's other birders around to back you up 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wilgils @9stan You'll have a job on. Better start a dog crèche too as that message may not be getting through. 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wilgils @9stan So they're encouraging more visitors, who may indeed never have visited before so won't understand the complexity of the place, to wander off down the spit and are offering no guidance. How very responsible. #Spurn #spurnbirds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@9stan @wilgils Have they employed any Rangers i.e. with pay involved or are they relying on volunteers??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sedgywarbler @RoutledgeSteve @McDonaldsUK No balloons for sale in either #JohnLewis or MarksandSpencer 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyedalePolice Come on, then; put us out of our misery - how DID it end up like that?? 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bluebellpond @simmonite_dave Quick word to Sandra, please. 'which will be on sale', not 'and will be on sale' 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyedalePolice Gives a whole new meaning to 'Fallen off the back of a lorry' 😱😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wilgils No problem. My guess is YWT will set up a zip line to transport new visitors across the breach. They could charge a fiver a time. What fun! 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbcpaddy More power to your elbow, Paddy. It'll be interesting to see how the Big Beasts react to your #plastic trial 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Thought that single Swallow would have turned round and left it for a couple of weeks 🙄🙄 I'd prefer southern Spain or suchlike with our current weather.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley There's a couple of Shovelers on the flooded field near us. If I get my bins and lean out of the bedroom window, will that count as a garden tick?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGlendinning @Wintersett1 @Barnsleybsg @wakeyweir86 A small number over #Pugneys lunchtime. Pleased to see them. Willow Tits and a very insistent GWoodie too 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ruthpeacey Ah. That's where you're wrong. They don't get brought home. They get used outdoors and thrown out of the car window or dropped. 🙄😳#Despair<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Willow Tit in bush next to yellow Digger working the drainage problem. #Pugneys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Hope you've got your wellies on this morning! #Pugneys. Green Woodie still calling 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 My late Mum and Dad used to live quite near to Lodge Hill. It's one of the few build able areas around Medway towns not built on. Prime target, sadly, in an already very built up area. 😡😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder @wakeyweir86 Wakes also doesn't have a dedicated nature reserve. Pugneys isn't. It's a public amenity which happens to get birds, occasionally interesting ones. CWetland is a sop to the office and commercial park. Correct me if I'm wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder @wakeyweir86 Some of the most knowledgeable and regular are not on Twitter. That doesn't mean they're not out there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scottish gamekeeper banned over alleged goshawk persecution  https://t.co/uN5WWx149g  How come the gamekeeper involved gets to remain anonymous? 🤔🤔 Pardon my naïveté.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ceeste45 @AdrianEvansEA Tell me about it. Here in #Wakefield it doesn't seem cool for some folk to use a bin full stop. 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wakeyweir86 Yes. Quick answer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ceeste45 @AdrianEvansEA Surely it takes more effort to dump them there than keeping them in a bag in the car for your next supermarket visit? Nearly all supermarkets have a collection point for batteries 🙄😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wilgils @RichardAENorth @martinhall1624 @TheAA_UK I suspect he was referring to the YWT version of #Spurn 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Flaminhaystack @Benfogle I watched the start of the video and couldn't believe what I was seeing. I felt utterly sickened and quite incredulous. 😩😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IdleBirder @BBCCountryfile My OH was teaching a lesson about Easter and the question of chocolate eggs, bunnies etc arose. A 13 yr old lad said, seriously, "Sir, I'm confused. So lambs don't lay eggs?"  The whole class was confused by that question 😱😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley Well no, actually, which is counter intuitive. I think most folk end up hiring a skip if it's a big job. Most fly tipping is white goods which is mad, as local council will collect on request 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MyWakefield Hi. Me again. This is from a clothes bank at Asda on the other side of the fence. It's on private land. Whose job to clear it away? The landowner is a local property developer. 🤔🤔  https://t.co/3o6KZqgxY9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley This happens in Yorkshire. If you have plasterboard etc it has to be paid for. It counts as industrial waste.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoutledgeSteve @StevieD131 @WildSpurn Some near us at #Pugneys have been flailed and are a terrible mess. The field near Asda however has been properly done and hedge trees pruned too. What a difference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IdleBirder Nothing whatsoever. Just the same pagan crossover as at Xmas. Easter comes from Eostre and has the same root as oestrogen. Fertility and new life. And as you'll know, rabbits lay eggs 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lizardschwartz Even better, kids from well known public school were sharing hotel and were invited to join the "blessing", including their staff who were livid when they realised they'd been conned 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another AFool from Stan. In Italy, leading a Ski trip. Easter Sun as today. Hotel owner in on it. He said he was a part time priest &amp; tradition was to bless skis on E Sunday. Kids stood solemnly with skis while blessing pronounced by 'priest'. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In memory of Stan. Best April Fooler ever. Many years ago, produced 'a letter from the Education Dept' saying they had run out of money for exercise books. Had 200 Y7s sitting for 15 mins ruling 1 cm margins in books, to save paper. Uproar when they realised they'd been had 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crymble47 @SteelySeabirder Repercussions 😳😳Do you mean what I think you mean? That's not good.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nocraigs @rob_yaxley It needs composting at a high heat, preferably in with cooked food waste, according to #Vegware website. Some Councils can do this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fanatic80s @traceydawn2 I remember seeing him in The Deerhunter. It's the only time I can recall an entire cinema emptying onto the street in Leeds in utter and complete silence, such was the impact of the film. #ChristopherWalken<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crymble47 @SteelySeabirder I'm not disagreeing, more playing Devil's advocate. I know how much cyclists and birders mean to the Mallorcan tourist economy. However, I think the Maltese would need a lot more than the odd hotel or restaurant full to persuade them. So it's Catch22 as it stands 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillAspin I don't think mine would match yours. He's an infrequent visitor and tends to flit in and out of the garden, usually when I am without camera.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillAspin Thanks for the excellent pic Bill. I get one of those in our garden occasionally but I've never managed to photograph it. Ours looks identical to yours. Neither one nor t'other.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jdhallphd Tell your daughter that if she requires corroboration, she just needs to pop into your local #Asda and see what happens when they leave trays of primroses out all day every day without water. Maybe she could explain to them why the plants are all crispy. 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllHallowsNight @Lionheart0075 @ceeste45 @Protect_Wldlife @Animal_Watch @peteswildlife @_AnimalAdvocate @RobRobbEdwards @BornFreeFDN @WorldAnimalNews @Animals1st @The_Animal_Team @MinaANDMaya You're probably right. But the experts agreed that TH removed the fittest, fastest, strongest animals, leaving a weaker, slower herd. Animal predators tend to go for weakest and oldest, leaving a stronger herd 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wilgils It's a pity that dogs can't read, as obviously those owners can't. 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crymble47 @SteelySeabirder I know what you mean, but the hotels and restaurants may not see it that way, sadly. Sri Lanka OTOH understands that their wildlife is the draw, protects it and promotes it, in their need to build tourism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crymble47 @SteelySeabirder Did that make sense?? 😳🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crymble47 @SteelySeabirder I have resisted going to Malta because of its execrable stance on Spring Hunting. I'd gladly go if that changed. Maybe if more birders went and that had a strong effect on tourism income, pressure might be put on Gov. However, I think they generate enough tourists already 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@northantsbirder @GPCbirding Why do men use an essential part of the female anatomy to describe horrid men? That one always puzzles me 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lionheart0075 @ceeste45 @Protect_Wldlife @Animal_Watch @peteswildlife @_AnimalAdvocate @RobRobbEdwards @BornFreeFDN @WorldAnimalNews @Animals1st @The_Animal_Team @MinaANDMaya On a different tack, interesting prog on R4 on Trophy Hunting. The TH'ers target healthy, prime animals, removing them from the gene pool. This negates the survival of the fittest, so leading eventually to a 'survival of the mediocre' and a downward spiral of the herd.🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimAshton_ Could do with some advice re logistics. Could you pls follow me so I can DM you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@missmagpirate Well it could be worse. Soliciting has another connotation too 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Do they publish their accounts anywhere? I'll ask daughter who is an auditor. She may well be able to say if your first question is answerable. As a charity there should be transparency 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder @Wintersett1 I honestly never realised that there were so many shooting magazines 😱😱😳🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wakeyweir86 About flamin' time!! 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Seasaver @Greenpeace Can I be really ignorant please and ask why the hell krill is trawled?? I only know it as whale etc food 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wakeyweir86 Well that kept me amused for a couple of minutes, deciphering this lot. There was a very loud Green Woodie at the top end of #Pugneys this morning, and a couple of Chiffies 🙂 Pleased to see that the Sandies are back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@salthepoet @sj_unwin @SAVEDORETREES @RobGMacfarlane @WildSheffield @robbiecowen @pfiennes @GillfieldWood @Ecclesallwoods @TotleyLibrary Whew you're safe then - hopefully 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@salthepoet @sj_unwin @SAVEDORETREES @RobGMacfarlane @WildSheffield @robbiecowen @pfiennes @GillfieldWood @Ecclesallwoods @TotleyLibrary I'd keep those photos to yourself before #Amey spot there's big trees in them and turn up with chainsaws #Sheffield<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WeWantPlates No it's not cos you're old. You're just normal and understand gravity. Runny sauce runs off slate onto table. That's why plates have rims of some description. Pity some kitchen staff don't understand this 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 They may have been around but I haven't - exam Invigilation every day for a fortnight and NYorks at weekends. I've finished now so can get out more. Will go in search of  sandies this teatime. Over the main lake?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Good! I've never heard one as close to the house before. Year tick too. First chiffie on Monday. 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Very loud, repeated bird 'laugh' by the farm bridge. I'm assuming a Green Woodie. Have you heard it or am I very wrong? 🤔😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stuntmanonvespa @WYP_RPU I think it's the fact he had no hands on the wheel, on the M1, in wet weather, in heavy traffic that might have been the deciding factors 🤔🤔Wouldn't want his anywhere near me 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tommcnorris Hi. When do your Mum and Dad get back from their travels? I've not heard from Marguerite for a few days x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobGMacfarlane Got to get it right first time. I'm all for it happening ASAP as there are SO MANY cans and bottles dropped around my semi urban patch by locals. Hope it's effective in making them think twice and return the things. #BottleDepositScheme<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@artweaverbell @WordsFromWez Easier just to stop giving the damn things out in the first place. Some end up in very out of the way places where wildlife get to them before humans can pick up. Plus, the helium can be put to better, medical, uses as it's in limited supply. 🤔🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TVsSimonKing I'm sure you're aware that a large number of past visitors to the area were, and still are, angered by YWT's decision to build the DC on prime habitat. We were also dismayed by your decision to endorse their choice by opening the place. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cleckbirder Sorry I couldn't be more helpful. We were in Kefalonia 2 yrs ago and I ended up using past birding reports from the web as a guide to what was likely where. Couldn't find anyone local available. Not a huge amount seen, with Turtle Doves being our favourites. 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cleckbirder Yes.  It's hot. Very hot. Take a hat! Can't help with a guide though, sorry.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AdamNFletcher @Wintersett1 @KeepBritainTidy @MyWakefield @yorkshirepost I followed an old Kia Sorento past Asda yesterday. After he'd cut me up to get into the traffic, he wound the window down &amp; chucked an empty can out. He also had only one brake light. How I wished I was in an unmarked police car. 😡😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justsandiesmith And have you spotted it? I 'read'  the book twice as an audiobook as I really enjoyed the complicated plot and needed a second listening. However, it isn't as easy to flick through the pages!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnthonyHorowitz @justsandiesmith Right. Need to get the book out again 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnthonyHorowitz @justsandiesmith Oh dear. I've read it twice and missed it, I assume. Give us a clue?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@choughchough @jgsigsworth @WoodlandTrust @Campaign4TREES @SaveUKTrees @Protect_Wldlife The saddest thing is that the woodland will be sacrificed for only 5 houses. And very expensive ones at that. Not for locals needing affordable homes I assume.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sophiemerrick1 @HughsWaronWaste @sainsburys @noplasticshopUK Two "benefits". One, it gives them a quick swipe bar code. And two, you have to buy a predetermined number of carrots.

<|startoftext|>@WestsideFireman @Wintersett1 I do wonder, at times, how we Brits manage, with 99% of the population not owning a gun, and those that do owning a shotgun for hunting, kept under lock and key and licensed by the Police.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FrankRGardner Just listening to you on R4 discussing this. I'm amazed you still have a sense of humour! Keep up the pressure 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HedgeComber @SteelySeabirder And I thought it was bad enough that I have to keep a weight on top of my bird seed bin because I've found mice (both dead and alive) in it. 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@9stan The grand opening appears to have been very much a lads' thing. How very diverse..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wilgils Well at least the community will have somewhere to pop out to for a nice latte and fruit scone, Jan, with the benefit of toilets too. I'm sure they're thrilled at the prospect. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfcyprus @GeorgiaLocock @Natures_Voice @ChrisGPackham @ComdJFC_UK @ruthpeacey @DefenceHQ @GavinWilliamson More of the same please. The birds thank you 🙂🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Good luck! I hope it keeps moving north. I had to brake rather suddenly this morning when a Grey Partridge crossed the road where you usually park. Don't often see that!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tommcnorris Well that's what the daughter earns per hour working for the opposition. 🙄🙄 There will actually be a team working full time on it, plus Managers, Senior Managers and Partners.

<|startoftext|>@kwid79 @rob_yaxley @BritBotArtists Price please? This'd go down well at the Primary School where I volunteer. I did a lesson on seed dispersal the other week at request of class teacher. Not the best time of year for examples 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@9stan @RoutledgeSteve @BBCPaulMurphy @MarkAvery @TVsSimonKing @ChrisGPackham @WildlifeTrusts I'll disagree. The biggest loser is the habitat, sadly. No bringing that back. People will visit who never knew the place pre-VC, for a nice day out and a tea cake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteelySeabirder Apparently not. It's everywhere. It is almost beyond help now. Impossible to clear up especially along major roads and motorways. We are a very dirty and litter-blind country. I despair 😩<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnLawArt Life's too short to hate. Especially dead people. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnLawArt It was a charity evening, raising money to provide a local Alzheimer's nurse. I have watched and enjoyed all his travel programmes. He was a very good speaker and I didn't let my politics get in the way of a good cause.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leedsbirder @YoloBirder Saw and heard one in Sri Lanka last year 🙂🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnLawArt You may think that. We went to an evening with him a couple of years ago, talking politics and travel, and he didn't seem particularly fond 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder I thought you'd be the one to ask. I've been working all week so haven't managed to get out. They might be there this weekend though 😳 Hope you're well 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder What's a 'doozy'? And while I'm here, d'you have earlier records for Beardies at CW? Or are these a first? 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stuheritage I'd normally agree. But on a visit to Holkham Hall, a young lad sat at the 'public' grand piano and played a piece he'd written for his GCSE Music. We all stood, spellbound. It was magic. 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Treespers42 @simmonite_dave @YorkshireTea @tetleyuk @38_degrees If you look at the #YorkshireTea twitter feed, you'll see that they're already working on it. 👍<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wilgils @RoutledgeSteve Oh the irony. Read the right hand side about avoiding disturbing birds and wildlife. Pity they failed to take their own advice. 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@apusbatesi @JoKingDevon Oh I get a quick response from the Twitter team. Then the fun starts as it's passed on to housing, or highways, or amenities and they in turn deny responsibility and nothing happens. Very dispiriting. Not giving up though 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicolaHanrahan I'm working all this week but could pop them round next week some time.  Have you had time to look at the cottage details if you fancy a visit? X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Really frustrating. I'm working all week plus volunteering so I'm stuck. Which end of CW or are they mobile?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoKingDevon 2/2. More locally, I've reported fly tipping on several occasions to our Council.  Nothing gets cleared away. Instead, different depts argue about whose land it's on, and whose responsibility. I could post pics to make you cry. It makes me livid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoKingDevon I regularly drive the A64 from A1 to Malton. Long sections are rammed with litter and rubbish. Lay-bys with no bins but piles of litter. There's been the front end of a car on the verge for weeks. Yet you'd take your life in your hands to clear it. 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lizardschwartz Have you got access to a qualified nutritionist via the Hospital?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicolaHanrahan I've got a couple of Hellebores going spare. Can you use them for your garden?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lizardschwartz Oh dear. Has she not noticed that parents with, say, dark hair have one child with dark hair and one with fair hair? Like mine did? #genetics<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley Oof! Glad it got to you in one piece. I hope it meets expectations and trust you won't find the jar half finished in the back of your fridge in 2023 🙄🙄 #DamsonJam #NotHartleys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VinnymanOne Now turn the bag over and see what it tells you about Goldfinches, assuming it's the same #Aldi UK bag as I was given.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ianbennell75 That sounds seriously unappetising. I can see that they try to introduce healthy foods, but you eat first with your eyes and that sounds and looks like brown slop. I love curries but I'd have passed on that too 😳🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lizardschwartz Can he drink stuff and keep it down Amy? Have they offered you the services of a nutritionist? May I ask for suggestions from a friend who used to be 'in' intravenous feeding and who might know what might help?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 And I'm in North Yorkshire! Typical 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrotherBikini @carl_thompson70 Of't committee, to be pedantic. However, this IS Harrogate and not Barnsley. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tommcnorris @McDonaldsUK You're probably right. Tho I must say my opinion of her food appreciation plummeted recently when she described the freeze-dried food they'd taken on their NZ  trail as "surprisingly good". I'd have had to be literally starving to write that 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tommcnorris @McDonaldsUK For heaven's sake! Eat proper food!! What would your Mother say?? 🙄x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Suzerock @Number10cat Since Sept 2017 I think. Last year we were in the Emirates for Int Women's Day. One of the big airlines sent an aircraft in staffed totally with women inc pilot and copilot. It had a mixed reception 🙄🙄🤗Way to go!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley @Sven_Wair 🙄🙄How many years do you plan on leaving it in the fridge?? Just eat it. 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley @Sven_Wair It's on its way second class so should arrive Monday 🤔🤔#NotHartleys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 I set off to work at 7:45. Got to school at 9 after a horrendous drive, only to be sent home. The Fieldfare were a bit of consolation 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now nearer 70 #Fieldfare #Pugneys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 At least 40 #Fieldfare appeared in gold beyond our garden. Up from farm track 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley @Sven_Wair Jar ready and waiting for an address. And yes, Tiptree nearly comes close. 🤔😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 If you go on the Yorkshire Tea twitter feed, they explain where they are with their developments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley I'm sorry. There's no such thing as Best with Hartley's. DM me your office address and I'll send you a jar of my Proper Damson Jam. It's so yummy, some folk eat it straight from the jar. 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Year 2s were thrilled when a 'Baby Chicken' turned up in the school garden this aft and started grubbing for worms right in front of them. They now know what a Juvenile Thrush looks like 🙄🤗. No camera, sadly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donnarainey4 Indeed. I do local litter picking but that problem is literally a step too far. I've contacted various agencies to highlight the matter but have been roundly ignored, sadly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Number10cat I think I'm right in saying that when he visited before,  Her Maj herself drove him round the estate in her Landie to remind him that women can drive..... Who says she doesn't have a GSOH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KrissyPeterssen @WeWantPlates So pleased to realise that this is not an English breakfast. 😳😳 However, some of our UK offerings come close #WeWantPlates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donnarainey4 The little beck near us is partly blocked by tree debris in several places, each one gathering dozens of plastic bottles and cans. Next stop the river Calder and then the sea. The bank is too slippy to risk clearing attempts 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lizardschwartz Look up the number of US states that have no lower age for marriage with the parents' consent. That's even more scary 😳😳<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder @Barnsleybsg @dannyfardell1 OH dropped me at the OM Tavern and I'd located the YBW within 5 minutes and the Firecrest 5 mins later. You should manage to do it in half that time 🙄🙄😉 The advice I was given - and it was spot on - was to look for other birders. So I did. #Wombwell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lizardschwartz He appears to me to be a man in a permanent state of anger. Must be quite wearing really.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArgyleLoz @tim_rigby No, sadly. There is no moral duty to pay tax. There are just badly drawn tax laws, full of loopholes which successive Governments have failed to address. You can legally avoid tax if the law is to your advantage.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChrisGPackham @simmonite_dave Interestingly in Sri Lanka, they have started replacing rubber trees with palm oil trees. Not cutting back virgin forest but replacing existing old and uneconomic plantations. A more sustainable method.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fizzychicken @ChrisGPackham A lot of this is due to illegal logging for hard woods.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley What? Why? Not a Tracey Eminent installation then?? 😳😳🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichardBowler1 @Recordshotmyars No, we don't really have a problem. It's just jealousy really 😳😳A record shot for me, with my Canon bridge camera, may look like a distant blob, but I KNOW that it's a Ring Ouzel 200 yards away. Now that's a record shot 🙂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@stevejamesPCC Well that's life, but it's been a real treat ( an expensive one in your case!) to 'host' #Fieldfare 🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lizardschwartz There are so many nice people on Twitter. He's just not one of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevejamesPCC We've got one #Fieldfare in the garden and a couple have flown over. Can't imagine trying to feed 70+ 😱😱 At least we've got Asda round the corner for endless apples...🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Barnsleybsg Thanks for your advice earlier. I never fail to be chuffed by the help and advice given by so many #Yorkshire birders who are invariably happy to 'share'. As a latecomer to birding, I find it very heartening. Never to old to learn. 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Aldi bird food bag is a fount of birding knowledge 🙂  https://t.co/E5sKmUXqkx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Given a bag of #Aldi suet nibbles for the garden birds. Looking forward to seeing these 🤔🤔  https://t.co/rIdbWWajkn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Barnsleybsg There were indeed. Saw both YBW pootling about by the hedge and then a very mobile Firecrest within 10 mins 🤗Thanks for advice! 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Barnsleybsg Being dropped off at OM Tavern shortly. Where's the best place to look for the Firecrest and YBW please?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tykebirder @simmonite_dave @AnglingTrust He's only done that because there isn't a handy bin within easy reach of his seat   🙄🙄 #litterlout<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doctor_oxford We get a £200 annual winter heating allowance, as all people above a certain age do. It is not means tested as to do so often precludes people from claiming. It would be good if there were an easy way of handing it on to elderly folk in more need.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RSPBbirders Sandal, Wakefield 2 in garden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Clairey2112 @simmonite_dave @_BTO @Britnatureguide @iNatureUK @Natures_Voice We had one today. I can't believe how aggressive it is. The usual blackbirds, sparrows, thrush and Woodpigeon have been sent packing. Despite that, it's a real treat to 'host' it #Fieldfare<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Yes they were, moving between the middle lake and motorway lake depending on the position of various Labradors etc  🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wilgils @IdleBirder 'I may disagree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it'.  Not a line that #YWT seem willing to take, Jan. More a case of 'We don't like being criticised so we'll block you'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 I'll call in later and see if they're still there. You never know. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Where the Shelduck?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder I've got a very aggressive Fieldfare that certainly isn't up for sharing his apples. Thrush, Blackbird and Woodpigs all seen off. Even the crows are keeping their distance!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirdTrack Look what's in my garden 🤗🤗First ever to my knowledge in 30 years #Fieldfare. Those apples 🍎 have paid off. Aggressive little bugger though!!  https://t.co/lhMAfPSBSD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lizardschwartz Nil desperandum then. The blanket of snow may have saved them. Just look for the little green shoots later! ❄️🌾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First sustainable Lego pieces to go on sale  https://t.co/F8mbE6SXXH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a solitary Fieldfare in the garden, single-handedly bullying every other bird away from the apples and seed. Beautiful bird though 🙂#Pugneys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lizardschwartz Depends if you went for hardy English or namby pamby French lavender which prefers Provence. 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tommcnorris Trust you and Corrina are ok, not forgetting Mallaig and Frank of course 😳😳x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder @jrmjones Not a word I use daily but sometimes only one specific word will do. The situation with the raptors is almost laughable - how can the land owners remain in 'ignorance' and deny any wrongdoing? How much longer can it be attributed to mere coincidence? Shakes head. 🙁🙁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jrmjones Because, I think, once they acknowledge that it's happening on 'their watch', then they will, perforce,  have to be seen to do something about it. Far easier to shut eyes and ears and sing 'La la la, can't hear you!'  Cynical? Me? #DGS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Howardian_Hills @BBCr4today Many years ago we had an elderly #Skoka as second car. It was deeply, deeply uncool but very cheap. When we had Big Snow, it was the only car off the estate due to having the engine in the boot 🙄🙂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lizardschwartz @Tesco I put loose tomatoes and other small stuff in paper mushroom bags and put anything else - onions, baking potatoes etc - straight into the trolley.

<|startoftext|>@mrkjduffy @DurhamBirdClub Last year, we left the house for a walk, to see Mum Mallard walking her brood down the street then turn right at the bottom, heading for #Pugneys. Goodness knows where she'd nested 🤔😳She was very determined!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobGMacfarlane I know this well. It was a frequent feature of my life before I retired. I used to tell myself that I could do nothing about any of it until I got to work so it was senseless to lie there worrying 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abe56Gaelle Can I politely correct you? I like learnING ... and .. How DO YOU pronounce it? Or How is it pronounced? Good luck with learning English. 🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley Waiting till Friday before commenting. Depends where you live methinks. Not much snow overnight here, but very cold indeed #Pugneys<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rrhgrant @RobGMacfarlane Neither now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobGMacfarlane This is what happens when a Council embraces PFI. It's all about the cheapest option and caring for the trees isn't the cheapest option.  Compare with Harrogate and their numerous mature trees and green public spaces.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@davidjcraven @wilgils Several hundred people DID get engaged in objecting to the new VC, yet something really horrible DID happen: the new VC which devastated the wildlife meadow. It has done irreparable damage to both #Spurn and the #YWT.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@carl_thompson70 We were talking to 4 USA adults recently who were aghast that we didn't have a gun at home and had never even handled a gun. How do you defend your home? they asked. Who from? I replied. Guns breed guns. #USA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JackieMorrisArt Well Jackie. I bought a copy signed by you from the bookshop in #Grasmere. We like it so much, I've bought one to give to the Primary school where I volunteer. I'd better warn them !! 🙄🙄😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Danford2013 @TomCadwallender Yes indeed. My efforts are strictly on local paths; the worst is the mile btw Asda and housing estate. I've counted 100+ cans which are my first target 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jgsigsworth @nybirdnews @AddeyNick @bluechaffinch1 Got to see the Ring Ouzel and Hawfinches at Brompton at the weekend. 🙂🙂 Where best for Goshawk and Brambling would you suggest please? #NorthYorks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@craftsmandave @TheTweetOfGod 'Your' is a possessive adjective; the one you want is 'you're' which is a contraction of you + are. Now go away and practise your grammar. 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@snettsbirder @SteelySeabirder I'm looking forward to seeing that Woodpecker on our garden feeder. What a dog's breakfast of a poster. 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Danford2013 @TomCadwallender Well, we can twin with the A64 and have a litter competition. Horrendous amount on some stretches. My local patch also matches the one in the pic so I've bought a litter picker- no use my moaning about it; I'm going to do something about it. 😱😱<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mick_turton @grahamhowie @9stan @thameswater @NaturalEngland I was thinking of Spurn as I was reading this. No doubt some QUANGO would be congratulating itself that these folk were out there walking, running, enjoying the fresh air... and buying coffee n cakes. Sod the birds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wathingsmecca Hope it's really well lit, to guide the birds in. 🙄🙄If it's good enough for #YWT.....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lizardschwartz 2 friends have adopted greyhounds. One is fine. The other is terrified of new people and also has intermittent major 'stomach problems' when scared. Love and care are helping, but they're in it for the long haul. Experience needed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lawabiding_NI I've tried a different track - flattery. Gosh! HM nests! They've chosen your house after flying 000's of miles to find a nest site! Amazing! They often don't realise and, once engaged, are happy to have been "chosen" 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Lost Words campaign delivers nature ‘spellbook’ to Scottish schools  https://t.co/dxKzK03jOT And that's Twitter at its best. 🤗🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MigrationMatt Ah, but you have to light the way to the tea and cakes, the coach park, the play area and dog walkers facilities. Sod the birds. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lizardschwartz @mrkjduffy I'm just obsessed with his photos of owls taking pit stops on oil rigs 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RareBirdAlertUK I bang on about this, sorry. To me, Hunting is the word that should be reserved for killing for legitimate food use. As a meat-eater, I have to condone it. But this isn't hunting, it's Target Practice for fun, and as such, the only legitimate target is a Clay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RareBirdAlertUK Yet again posts like this make the 'Like' button the wrong response. Really need a 😡. Some men - and sadly the 'hunters' out there probably are all men- are despicable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DjohnstoneDavid Somebody was watching you, I can only assume? I know they're all replaceable, but the photos aren't and your peace of mind isn't. Commiserations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bluebellpond That's the magic of Twitter. Lots of us are now aware of it and demanding a response. Mr S says it was a contractor's error, now corrected. We want to know why the lights are there at all or why they are of that style. To be continued, I think #YWT #DarkSkies #Spurn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WriterJuneHur Interested by your use of the word 'patron' which is repeated elsewhere on replies. Not a term a U.K. librarian would use 🤔#Language<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@9stan Thank you for that, Martin. I do think that YWT's method of working seems to be influenced by the caring and wildlife friendly approach demonstrated by Mr Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wilgils @9stan 'Discovery Centre' 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wilgils Well that's a tiny positive in this unholy project.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@9stan @wilgils Thank you for that, Martin. It always helps when someone knows more than the average. Good luck with your formal complaint. Lots of folk are behind you #KnowledgeIsPower<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wilgils Is this Simon King the wildlife camera man?  He off the TV? He of Springwatch etc?  He's just gone seriously down in my estimation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wilgils Jan - following the carpark lighting fiasco, would you mind checking to see if the contractors have in fact 'switched the timer on' and the lights are off - and report back to us all please? I'm happy to take it further if it's still a problem. #Spurn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobStoneman @HanbyAndrew @NSpurnbirder @wilgils @YorksWildlife Thanks for your prompt reply. It is to be hoped that the timer's now switched on, though I think we're all still wondering why a daytime carpark needs lights at all. And if you'd asked for down lighters, you've been done over 😳😳 #YWT #Spurn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RareBirdAlertUK @Team4Nature300 @Protect_Wldlife @LeagueACS @NYPRuralTF @northyorkscc @RaptorPersScot @Julia_Mulligan @Gameandwildlife @BASCnews @BeefyBotham And the tragedy is that #NorthYorkshire is a beautiful county. We just don't need the tiny minority who see such acts of cruelty as acceptable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobStoneman @NSpurnbirder @wilgils @YorksWildlife This is not a 24/7 supermarket you're lighting here. The reserve closes at dusk. Therefore nobody is there to need the lights. The lack of 'empathy' for, or appreciation of, a dark skies reserve is breathtaking. #Spurn #YWT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GlenOrioleglen @wilgils We all know who is 'responsible'. They're just not very responsible, if you understand my meaning. #YWT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wilgils Is it there in the application by #YWT that light pollution would be avoided? The Planning Officer, or whoever, needs to see this. It's wrong on so many levels. And utterly unnecessary. I dread to think what else they have up their sleeve.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@missmagpirate Well you could try, I suppose, but rhubarb goes squishy when cooked, and I suspect the time taken might not be well spent. Only one way to find out......!! 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bluebellpond As I said to another post-er, what is the point of lighting up an empty space? If it's a carpark, and it's empty because it's closed, then it's all very wrong for so many reasons. #Spurn #LightPollution #YWT. Disgraceful lack of awareness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisGPackham Yup, that was my reaction exactly. Was expecting the Tracey brothers to step out!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Lukesteele4 As I've said before, that's target practice, not hunting. Go and shoot clays instead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senilesid I'm in no way defending Branson but why are you not calling out #Stagecoach as well ? They are by far the major owners. And as for passengers with bags on seats refusing to help...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Andrew_Adonis The East Coast mainline ran very well as a nationalised entity. Clean trains, on time, friendly staff. What more do you need?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@9stan There is no need for those lights whatsoever. What are they lighting? An empty space. Ridiculous. #YWT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bugboybaker Beat that. 😳😳😡😡  https://t.co/yGBxV2MI90<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bugboybaker @dartmoornpa Hedges need to be cut back regularly to do their job and do regrow quickly. However, the flail machine leaves a real eyesore - and hedge-sore behind. Other machinery is available. I'll find a pic of young willows near me... 😱<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley An interesting little village.  We stopped at the post office-cafe a couple of years ago and asked about the ginormous red-brick Hall we'd passed as we came into the village, thinking it was open to the public, to be told it's a second home 😳😳<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mortimerSeth So I should've said, "You mean he pays tax?" I suspect he's up there with the other Big Names, allegedly, as Hislop might add, and pays out as little as possible.  A very insidious presence, methinks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mortimerSeth @ThePoke @Claudiacc @BestoftheMail @ThomasPride @parislees @barneyfarmer @IsabelHardman @ZoeParamour @DanielJHannan @alicevjones Tax returns? You mean he pays UK tax? I didn't realise #Branson 🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sainsburys 2/2. I haven't got a bar code and would need to drive into town to get one. You only sell one variety of loose veggie samosa on your Deli. I'll take a photo next time! 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sainsburys Re Veg samosas. Bought them Wakefield Ings Road store. This is not a store problem but a recipe problem. They are the same every week and I only buy them because, even falling apart, they're much better than other supermarket ones 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sainsburys 2/2 I buy them from the Wakefield store and have done so for a long time, but they seem to have got more of a problem. They arrive packed in a box, so I imagine the same ones go nationwide?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sainsburys Hi Gordon. No, it's the loose veg samosas sold on the Deli. The lamb &amp;chicken ones hold together well; the veg ones often fall apart when handled. The Deli staff find them difficult to serve as they're very fragile and 'limp'. They need looking at by your recipe developers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Woody172 @WrightRainEnv @mcsuk We seem to cope with households recycling but view takeaway packaging- cups n bottles- differently. What's your thoughts on cups? All bio or coated? Do we need more recycling plants that can deal with them? Confusing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paul230156 What's the best route to Danby Beacon from Pickering direction? It appears to be in the middle of nowhere....🤔🤔Thanks if you can help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Woody172 @WrightRainEnv @mcsuk The problem with coffee shops having recycling facilities is that people are highly unlikely to return the cups when empty - they've taken the cup away and will just bin it (or drop it). What do you suggest as the best answer?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ceeste45 @PeterPr73 I've seen it twice and on both occasions, the weather has been less than clement. Blowing a gale, rainy, icy - the poor chap needs all the help he can get. A young lady from a local wildlife place has brought mealworms for him.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sainsburys Hi. Could you please do a quality check on your loose veggie samosas? Unlike the chicken and lamb ones which hold together well, the veggie ones fall apart as they're being bagged up, then again when you come to cook them. Not good considering the price.  Tasty though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 @johnnymacbirder Thanks. 1 week or 2?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BaristaBuggy @mcsuk If they use fully biodegradable cups, which are out there, the tax should not apply. There's an incentive al round @MaryCreaghMP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mcsuk 2/2. They have created this market for takeaway drinks but take no responsibility for the outcome ( as per Coca Cola etc). Buy a keep cup if you do regularly buy takeaways and remember to take it with you. Train yourself! So not an easy answer #responsibility<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrightRainEnv @mcsuk I'm rather conflicted. I rarely buy takeaway coffee as I'm retired and when I have a coffee 'out' it's a sit down do.

<|startoftext|>@MickgCunningham My Mum also suffered from it, another non-smoker, drank little and never overweight. It's incredibly painful; look after yourself and stay well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirdTrack Thank you! Will check. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shefstevewilson @Hudsonweather Technically, but the Star makes it sound as if it were the city centre so affected. High Bradfield is usually the windiest outpost in Yorkshire. And has an excellent brewery too 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SboroGottLad Yes, and the shots aren't too shabby, considering I was hanging over the sea wall 🙄😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SboroGottLad Was it you who helped me find the #PurpleSandpipers on the sea wall? I think I've nearly recovered from taking the photos. Very inelegant but effective! Thanks again. And ignore this tweet if it wasn't....👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fairburnjohng When we were practically living in Medway hospital for a week when my parents were in ICU concurrently (long and v sad story) the Almoner offered us free parking. It was a great help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CatsInFrance @B_Strawbridge Or it'll end up being shipped to India, which will just pile it into plastic mountains...😱😱 Out of sight, out of mind.  #CocaCola and other big plastic users should be obliged to develop proper recycling and reusing systems. Pigs flying🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shroommuse @jeanhoodauthor @B_Strawbridge You can refill some #Ecover products - check your local Health Food store. No need for poly packing pellets as compostable cellulose ones are available and do the same job. #plasticpollution<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shroommuse @B_Strawbridge Non-plastic handled cotton buds are available from most supermarkets now. Look out for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WillboneScott @BritanniaLtd @northyorkscc @TheScarboroNews @RSPBNews @Bempton_Cliffs @GrahamScott14 @AndrewHuyton @midgleybirder @ChrisGPackham Will, have you had any response from @BritanniaLtd re the dead birds? Or is their CustomerService Dept still recovering from the festivities? 🙄 #Kittiwakes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirdTrack Happy 2018. How long does it take for records entered  via App to appear on the web based version please? Or don't they? 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dovey1974 @_robsheldon @Natures_Voice @martinRSPB @LessPlasticUK @aplastic_planet @mcsuk @kevnjcox @MarkAvery @jazzy_jeff44 @TurnTidePlastic @BirdwatchExtra I use #Ecover washing up liquid and take the bottle for refilling at local Health Food shop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_robsheldon @Natures_Voice @martinRSPB @LessPlasticUK @aplastic_planet @mcsuk @kevnjcox @MarkAvery @jazzy_jeff44 @TurnTidePlastic @BirdwatchExtra The irony was not lost on me.

<|startoftext|>@Jonny09Jonny My surprise bird of NYDay, perched on the cliffs at Scarborough 👍The bird, that is, not me. #Peregrine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@derekbtimages @StansaidAirport 🙄🙄😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WildlifeTrusts A fat Woodpigeon on the lawn when I opened the curtains. A porpoise and grey seal later in the day at #Scarborough off Marine Drive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mostlyscarce I think many of us might take issue with your use of the word 'decent'. There would be dancing round the patch at #Pugneys #InlandNorth with that list 🙄🙄#PWC2018<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@derekbtimages @StansaidAirport Ah, but you're confusing Stansted with Stansaid. The world's most dysfunctional airport 😱😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonny09Jonny @countrywalking You're having a year off in 2018 or have you run out of road so to speak?  Walking in Africa is a very different proposition 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@countrywalking @Jonny09Jonny I'm aiming at walking 1000 miles this year, minimum. OH has 2500 mile cycle target. Keeping us #oldies #active. #fitbit #garmin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley Went to Whitby for the Desert Wheatear then walked to Sandsend. Today was Scarboro and Purple Sands with added Peregrine and 15500 steps 👍#Fatbit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jake_Gearty New neighbour's were freaked out by the weird noises they heard at night. They were happier to know it was just the local Little Owl sitting on their roof, calling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobTemple101 Some of us heat it up in a thing called a 'kettle' and pour it over dried leaves. This results in 'tea' which is a little less bland.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fileybirder Thanks! We're in Scarboro on Marine Dr near Scalby Mills. Young birder Michael pointed 5 out at base of sea wall. I had to sprawl across 5 ft wide wall and hang over edge for photo 😳😳Filey might be more elegant!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fileybirder Happy New Year to you. Can I ask where is/are the best place(s) in NYorks for Purple Sand please?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley Happy New Year to you too. Gave the #Fatbit a thrashing yesterday with 21,652 steps around Whitby. Not sure about today but Scarborough is calling 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First bird of 2018. A bluddy fat Woodpigeon hoovering up the birdseed 🙄Things can only get better....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder I don't think I fall into either category, but HNY to you and yours 🎉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StansaidAirport I rest my case 😱🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bentleybirdman1 Nice to meet you this lunchtime. Lovely pics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WillboneScott @simmonite_dave @BritanniaLtd @northyorkscc @TheScarboroNews @RSPBNews @Bempton_Cliffs @GrahamScott14 @AndrewHuyton @midgleybirder @ChrisGPackham Having once made the error of staying in a #Britannia hotel in London, I'm not surprised by the lack of care here. #Scarborough BC need to be aware of this. Ditto #NYPolice Wildlife Officer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mn_reeder But you'll stay on Twitter though?? 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StansaidAirport PS. Do you EVER get visits from Health and Safety?? The attrition rate amongst #Stansaid staff is rather worrying. A little training also would not go amiss 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StansaidAirport No, thank you! Your comments invariably make me smile; keep em coming. Especially loved yesterday's car park pic. 👍👍😄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarraghHudson Couldn't believe how busy Whitby was. It'll probably be worse tomorrow! I'll look out for you round the patch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarraghHudson Sorry I missed you! We hung around for about 30 mins then walked across to Sandsend and back. RPs and Oycs in fields and Turnstone by harbour. A god day. Knees now knackered however 🙄😳How's college? Happy 2018 to you 🎉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarraghHudson Hi Darren! Long time etc! Yes. Late morning. V easy to find. Little road to side of Abbey; look for birders on path btwn 2 fields. Bird was on wall then came to about 5 yards away. Still there mid aft. Remarkable! 🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet another pic of the #DesertWheatear -sorry!- but what a lovely little bird to end the year on. #Whitby #NorthYorkshire #Lifer  https://t.co/jhO68MmlXn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave Of course it was still there! Despite very windy weather #DesertWheatear 👍👍#Whitby  https://t.co/quUbHZwxo9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CraigCThomas1 @_BBRC But will it be there today? #WindyWhitby Have I left it too late? We'll see 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@birdersagainst @RaptorPersScot I'm puzzled by the location of this shot kestrel. It's several miles from the Nat Park and in open farmland outside Malton. It's on a quite busy junction. I've told Jean Thorpe I'll keep a close eye out when on that bit of road, as I use it quite regularly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WildeAboutBirds Did you read the article yest in the DT by Baroness Mallalieu on Hunting with Hounds? I read it with a rising sense of disbelief. The comments BTL were a revelation too. Very depressing read 😕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrimOopNorth Sandal Castle awaiting the snow.  https://t.co/QBk97olk56<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mn_reeder From the Latin.  It's the comparative form of 'bad'. The superlative form gives us the word 'pessimist'. #Linguist #Apologies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mn_reeder @RoutledgeSteve @nybirdnews Assumed by the fact it's always used pejoratively that it stood for something as an acronym. But couldn't work the word tw@t into it effectively 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mn_reeder @RoutledgeSteve @nybirdnews Do enlighten me- why 'tog'? I think I may regret the question 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonny09Jonny I could be a vegetarian quite easily, but I'm afraid I couldn't live without cheese. Proper cheese of any description.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maw @Andrew_Adonis I felt that the Remain camp never thought it was ever going to happen and never took it as a serious threat. More info about what Brexit would mean came out AFTER the ref. Cameron should have said it was 'advisory', not a mandate to leave. #Crazy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StonesGary Hmm.  Some bot picking up words such as Bird and Tit and then misconstruing them for some reason maybe😂.  I used the phrase 'not fit for purpose' and suddenly had several Gyms following me 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahdal_gulls Difficult, but go with your gut feeling and bear in mind safety of all concerned. Could you live with yourself if it went pear shaped? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Andrew_Adonis What a great pity that the Remain camp did not do a better, stronger and more hard hitting job in the run-up to the Referendum. Totally under-prepared and woolly. #Despair #Omnishambles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshual951 @YorksWildlife I've read the full article and am rather conflicted by it. Not sure it's always a good idea to let people know exactly where to go to find (and take home??) some of our rarest plants. Not everyone just takes pics. #Orchids<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobTemple101 I was wondering if anyone out there had a recipe for Christmas Pudding curry. #Leftovers 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatchBirding Yes it has, thank you. Am now sitting at a not too shabby 17th in Inland North, though there's plenty of time to be soundly overtaken. 🙄🙄#PWC2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshual951 @YorksWildlife Is he actually advocating that we can nip out and dig them up? If not, his words are poorly chosen as that's how it reads 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrimOopNorth  https://t.co/cxo3KgGp2Q<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McKenzie6593 Hmm. You've crossed a line there.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnie_fisk You know what they say, what's mine is mine and what's yours is mine too....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Missed them. Was just watching the opening of the latest Star Wars film in Leeds 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoutledgeSteve @traceydawn2 I was thinking of setting up a Twit account called Its grim etc for people to post lovely pics of the North. 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nybirdnews @andyhood75 @RareBirdAlertUK If it could just hang around for the weekend.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoutledgeSteve @traceydawn2 It's grim oop North 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rothiemoon We were all set to climb Scafell the other week to complete husband's Wainwrights. Group of us had convened but reports of Storm Brian's 86mph winds made us think again. Didn't want to be foolhardy just to tick a list. It'll get done in 2018! #SafetyFirst<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeanthorpeRR We're regularly passing through Amotherby and to date I've never seen or heard anyone shooting. I'll be more alert from now on, Jean.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jjstruthersuk What a wonderfully stylish photo!  I trust the other guests were all suitably impressed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatchBirding Hi. How long after submitting lists does the website take to update? And when is your 2017 deadline? Thanks 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder @Barnsleybsg @wakeynats @grayspeight @Fitzybirder Blimey!  That's a lot of Brambling. I'm usually disappointed by NMDam woods as they seem strangely devoid of bird life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@choudychouds I'm not claiming that it will. But you seemed to be implying that she was unaware of the situation. Or maybe I've just misinterpreted your post.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donnarainey4 @ZilchUK @KeepNIBeautiful @CausewayCouncil Thanks for posting the before and afters. I've just come back from a walk that is also done by ppl between Asda, a school and housing estate with no bins provided. It's just a trail of litter. This has made me even more determined to do a regular clean 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@choudychouds If I remember rightly, Her Maj was on the scene at Grenfell well before anyone from the Gov or Council. She met both survivors and Emergency workers, so I think she is aware of it. And no, I'm not a raving royalist; I just watch the news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@asda You've installed a milkshake machine in #Wakefield store. I now follow a trail of blue plastic straws on my walk home. Can you at least provide paper straws? Plastic ones are used for 5 mins, last a lifetime. #PlasticPollution<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickgas1 @nybirdnews ??? I saw something resembling this in Sri Lanka. What's it doing over here??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/5BMpUyWl2r. @michaelgove Companies like Shell, Exxon and Ineos are profiting from plastics. They should be required to fund recycling plants to clear up their products. #PlasticPollution<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley Each to his/her own, I suppose. Though I do wonder about the brain which thought - hmm, I've got a really good idea about some camper van bird houses....🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley Ready to have my life controlled. Xmas present from daughter #Fatbutt 😳😱  https://t.co/wVuukUAoth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley  https://t.co/SPXkPS1wKD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley Glad you found a stylish bird table- it does look rather more engineered than the usual wood n slate ones. 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder @rob_yaxley @Jonny09Jonny @costadeldeen @YoloBirder @Jake_Gearty @sconebirding @Sven_Wair @Malc15 But would you drink it now? Tho a snowball usually needs a maraschino cherry 🍒 another of your #5aday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley @Jonny09Jonny @costadeldeen @YoloBirder @jonnybirder @Jake_Gearty @sconebirding @Sven_Wair @Malc15 Does anyone actually buy advocaat (that disgusting yellow stuff, however you spell it)? The advert says that it isn't Xmas without it...... 🤔🤔🤔😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeanthorpeRR Happy Christmas, Jean. I'd like to think that you'll have a quiet 2018 but I suspect those Owls and raptors will keep coming, sadly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 @BigSkell What are the chances of that Smew turning up again before the new year?? #Pugneys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@moneyandmedia @BBCTheArchers Ooh! Can I have the recipe for that please? It sounds really ........ different 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigSkell @mhemingway25 I#happy Christmas 🎄 I'll need to walk off Christmas dinner!!  Here's hoping for a Mega New Year 🤔🤔🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcesherwood Bah humbug! 🎄🎄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley Would make a rather splendid Christmas card, methinks 🎄🎄🤗🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carriejoyhouse The message is spot on. Ullapool in Scotland have gone Straw Free #NaeStrawAtAw . Now if only someone can lose that apostrophe....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave @Barnsleybsg Thanks. Was driving up to Brewery in works van and couldn't stop easily. The light was v difficult - sun v low and dazzling. Saw 2 big flocks of Fieldfare tho which was a bonus. 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Barnsleybsg Went up to High Bradfield yest morning- Grouse on tops. Saw 2 that looked Black - is that likely or was it the light??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Recordshotmyars 😂😂😂👍👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CraigBennett3 Now to work out how to store it for frosty, windless nights. 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikes_garden @RevRichardColes Had the misfortune of being offered Stilton with strawberries and champagne today. Not separately, but as a flavoured cheese. Pink and disgustingly bad 😱😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephBirdArt Yes please. Good idea 🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@djfindus No I won't retweet as for some reason I dislike an essential part of the female anatomy being applied to a seriously deranged and objectionable male 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GordonMcKee_ Some of us are old enough to remember when you could go to the Post Office and get a paper one-year passport. And school kids could travel on a Collective Passport 🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@traceydawn2 I'm glad I didn't have to make the #Masterchef decision. 3 fantastic chefs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DyanaGeek @Soosanssmallads @BBCTheArchers I think in this case, it's the scriptwriters doing the "goodie goodie" girl (Lily) and the "out of control" boy (Freddy) egged on by the "left to do her own thing" girlfriend (Nolly) trope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimAshton_ There's loads. They are nearly all House Sparrows, but pretend to be Hedge Sparrows (🙄) as they prefer a neighbour's thick privet hedge, or the elder and hazel hedge on the farm track. We now also have a few Tree Sparrows after an 11 yr gap 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimAshton_ @stevedudley_ @BoyWonderBirder We don't get many sparrows in the garden as we are next to a Country Park and they feed there. The cold weather brought lots in, with 3 Reedies too. Rather a surprise!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder You've been rather quiet of late?🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LincsRuralCrime Just hope you didn't escort them to North Yorks. There's enough #WildlifeCrime there already. Well done, regardless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoutledgeSteve They're probably learning how to make scones, coffee, tea and cake 🙄🙄#Spurn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlsBoy The body language of the pair of them says it all 😱😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Protect_Wldlife @ceeste45 This is where Twitter needs a different response button. I doubt that thousands actually Like this photo. Enraged, bewildered, disgusted, yes, but not liking it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Soosanssmallads @BBCTheArchers That young man is not going to end well. And Miss South Africa is looking at early deportation for aiding and abetting 😳😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McKenzie6593 Alder, cherry, not ash as that has black buds so elder?? And ivy. Nul points?? 🌿🍃🌳🌲<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@holli_day hi. The daughter would like to know where your #Strike brown coat was from please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sconebirding @GyrCrakes @_BTO Those claws look like something from a mini Terminator 😱😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeShute @Telegraph We rarely see them in the garden. They are currently feeding on thistledown in a nearby field.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jgsigsworth @RoutledgeSteve Should've gone to Specsavers. Would make a good advert 🤔🤔😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcesherwood His 'Man Drawer' and 'Loft' musings are v funny because we have that very drawer and I never go in the loft. Worth a listen. 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JMAGarrett @simmonite_dave @avonwt @BBCEarth @BrisParksForum @AFONature @BirdgirlUK @bristolnatchan @WildlifeTrusts @bristolgreen @Natures_Voice The tree owner will doubtless say that there are plenty of other branches available as perches. I'm more concerned about damage caused to the tree. There again, better this than felling a 'nuisance' tree as per #Sheffield.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcesherwood But, not it. No glasses to hand 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcesherwood It's not just me then. I used to enjoy his stand-up routines it can't bear his current reincarnation 😡😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sven_Wair @rob_yaxley Yes, that struck me too. However this is obviously FAR more mathematical and scientific. Very impressed 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillAspin @RoutledgeSteve I must admit it wasn't a good look for a pair of very expensive bins. I hope mine last better but I've not had them long.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HuntSabs @simmonite_dave What is 'aggravated trespass'? Police round here want info on Hare Coursers and are prepared to crush vehicles used.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillAspin @RoutledgeSteve They look like a new pair of bins. Was it done under guarantee or did they charge you? #Swaros<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley Right. Today's walk gave 2 rats on a mega pile of manure in the field, 7 robins, 3 shopping trolleys and 14 magpies. I'll leave you to work out the score.  🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lidlkim I don't think I can bear the thought of Wor Ruth screeching 'A bee-beeee??' in her cod Geordie accent.  I think I'll just rely on catch up for a few days 🙄🙄😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DerwentBirder Deffo Man Flu then 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaMJournalist @rob_yaxley @DefraGovUK Not a good look for North Yorkshire.  Maybe it's because we have a lot of grouse moors.... 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DerwentBirder It's only flu if you pass the £20 test. S'one puts a £20 note at the bedroom door. If you get up to pick it up, it's yours. And if you can face getting up, you haven't got flu. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@devoncountysabs If that's your Defender, I'd blur the Reg before posting photo. Rather tempting to some.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlsBoy Rather like me trying to clarify my email address in a shop and the girl writing it down as hmilburnthatswithoneL. ...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Mereite @B_Strawbridge @Tesco @waitrose @Morrisons @asda It's psychological. OH worked for a local farm shop. Provable fact that lots of customers will pick up a pack of 4 apples if one's available yet might hand pick just one or 2. Sales proved it. Weird.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clarkzip @B_Strawbridge @ColinMoat1 @Tesco @waitrose @Morrisons @asda Shops brainwash customers into totally unnecessary 'hygiene'. If it's wrapped, it's clean and safe. Totally barmy. Just pop it into a paper bag and wash/peel it. It drives me potty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B_Strawbridge @Red_eyed_Video @Loppylugs1951 @dunnjons @Tesco @waitrose @Morrisons @asda Cucumbers are wrapped due to length of storage. They shrivel if left 'open' to air and therefore get chucked and wasted. Swedes also shrivel but again it's if kept a long time. It's supermarket systems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomCadwallender Saw loads of them in SL earlier in the year. One of our hotels had 4 (four!!) different types of Kingfisher in the grounds. Unbelievably good. Can I go back please? 😉<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BiodiversitySoS I asked Gethin what was used instead of lead, as I genuinely did not know. So the list of metals was down to my query. As I said to him, as a meat eater, how can I condemn people hunting for food? Otherwise I'm the hypocrite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GethinJones123 @BiodiversitySoS @ChrisGPackham You're replying to the wrong person there Gethin. First I'm aware that most recreational fishermen return their catch. Second, I eat chicken. Therefore how can I condemn duck caught for food? The Food bit being crucial.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GethinJones123 @BiodiversitySoS @ChrisGPackham Out of interest, Gethin, what should legally be used if not lead? Genuine question, politely asked.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@johnlewisretail Our pans which we bought 18 months ago (JL own brand) and don't often use are looking rather shabby 😳  https://t.co/7xX3Q6qvYq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimAshton_ I'm often dismayed by what GW choose to show. A shade garden? Ooh good. Ah- it's actually a bloke with 10 acres and a woodland, not a wee patch overlooked on 3 sides that's had wonders worked. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lizardschwartz Keep calm and carry on. Don't worry until you have something definite to worry about. Hope it all works out well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimAshton_ I tried suggesting to #RHS that they do some wildlife and car friendly tiny front gardens at their shows. So many city people have a paved carpark space with nothing else. No response 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimAshton_ @ceeste45 @Team4Nature300 @NearbyWild @Britnatureguide @NatureUK @WildlifeTrusts @Natures_Voice @BTO_GBW @urbanbirder @WildAbtGardens @McKenzie6593 I keep emailing #GardenersWorld and nattering them to do a mini series about transforming little gardens for wildlife. They keep ignoring me. Such an easy series to make with potentially dramatic results.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peediepuss @ceeste45 According to comments in the Telegraph below an article about plastic in the seas, it's all Fake News and Project Fear. It isn't happening. Apparently Sir David is wrong. Shakes head in utter disbelief. 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RossAhmed @MacNavin1 @damian_money I bought a different make earlier in the year and hung one feeder over the edge of a flower bed. We ended up with a marvellous crop of carrots in Autumn.....😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoutledgeSteve We've had over 20 again today, with a family of Reed Buntings too. They're happier with seed scattered on the lawn rather than in feeders. Bucktons for me, from #BATA in Kirkbymoorside 🤗<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BirdGuides @BirdwatchExtra Now that's the sort of news that will upset the general public enough for them to take notice. Penguins and Puffins are sufficiently cute.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Benfogle @WordsFromWez @Tesco @sainsburys @waitrose @LidlUK @Walmart @marksandspencer @AldiUK Paper straws exist. Compostable carrier bags and drink cups exist. Paper cotton buds exist. Paper bags exist. Cellophane exists. Glass bottles and Alu cans exist. Plastic versions don't need to. #Change #plasticpollution<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HughHarrop @Oceanwarrior @ScottishSeas @GreenpeaceUK @foe_us @SaveScotsSeas @SeabirdCentre @BBCScotWeather @BirdWatchingMag @aplastic_planet I've asked #Sainsburys, #Waitrose, #Tesco, #Asda about using compostable carrier bags (as per Whitby #Coop). My suggestion has been registered. Action needed instead. Also paper bags for fruit n veg, not plastic. Just DO IT!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArapChumo @HughHarrop @Oceanwarrior @ScottishSeas @GreenpeaceUK @foe_us @SaveScotsSeas @SeabirdCentre @BBCScotWeather @BirdWatchingMag @aplastic_planet Sadly, modern life revolves around plastics. Most food packaging, most non-food bottles, everyday items packaged in the stuff. Everything we take for granted has links to plastics. And yet alternatives are out there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It must be cold. 20+ Sparrows and 3 Reed Buntings scrabbling for bird seed on the lawn. Usually only 1 or2 spuggies at best 😳#Pugneys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamiraAhmedUK Why did you begin your tweet with the word 'So'?  It really is an irritating modern verbal tic, alien to us oldies. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley No snow here of any colour or description 🙄🙄. Yet. #Wakey #Pugneys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WfldPeregrines @Fileybirder I'd appreciate them more if they rounded up the magpies and woodpigs which are hoovering up the birdseed in our garden #WakeyPeregrines<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_BTO @mattthesparrow As a positive, we have a very small colony here at #Pugneys for the first time in 11 years. #TreeSparrow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BTO_GBW @BirdTrack We had our first #CoalTit of the year last week. There were well over a dozen on the feeders at #YorkshireArboretum when we went Hawfinch-ing in November.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jojoetaylor23 @The_Balmoral Was in John Lewis restaurant in Cambridge and the young woman 'seating' people referred to a group of elderly ladies as 'You guys'. No. Stop it. It's just wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigSkell @mhemingway25 no!!  I've not seen one so close to here but it'll only be a matter of time before they're regular. I think Wintersett see them occasionally. Lucky man!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dannigilroy An Eider as dreamed up by Disney, I think 🤔🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamyt123 @Recordshotmyars @CBCSightings By the looks of that, more likely to be #Nessie than anything vaguely bird-like.......😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Recordshotmyars Indeed. There's no such thing as perfect light at this time of year - or at most times of year in the UK come to think of it. Which is my excuse for my truly cr@p photos. 😳🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anniecheflife @WeWantPlates @Nick_Whittaker YOU might put them in the dishwasher but the one in the original post looked like it had done years of service without even a wipe 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BTO_GBW @BirdTrack We've had only one in the garden. However, walking from the house to the back of the Country Park (half mile) I've counted over a dozen in the hedges #Robins<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wildwood_photos It is indeed an awful photo. It's so utterly awful that I only wish I'd taken it myself 🙄🙄🙄You should see MY Yorkshire Arboretum Hawfinch blurs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeWantPlates @Nick_Whittaker I'm quite happy to use a wooden bread board and even wooded chopping boards at home; I'm not convinced about them being used in a multi multi user environment.  I bet they just get a quick wipe in the kitchen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterStefanovi2 @andyhood75 That has a certain ring of logic to it 😳😳. A very twisted logic, however. If I'd not done my job as dramatically as he hasn't done his, I'd have been given the push. He, on the other hand, will wriggle out of it #WeaselWords<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dunnjons @SteelySeabirder @BBCScotWeather Looks a little choppy out there. Have you got the washing in?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Worth a listen. R4 Inside Science (16:30 today; find it on iPlayer) about research into effects of Trophy Hunting on populations and subsequent ability of a herd to adapt following genetic loss of Alpha males.  Survival of the mediocre, not fittest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrBrendanCox What was equally shocking was the Mayor of Jerusalem saying that DT is a man who understands the Middle East. He understands nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlsBoy I trust that's BoJo in the 'flying suit'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley Rather more tasteful. Is a potential disaster, ie self-assembly? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@campbellclaret I'll disagree. At least #DadsArmy was funny and they more or less understood what they were supposed to be doing. #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarilynBlancheM @jounwin The LIN as Lan, the G as a the g sound in Engineer but soft, and the ERIE as Eree. Lanzheree sort of does it. It comes from Linge - linen in French. You can google it and hear it pronounced.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlsBoy @jounwin And Seccetry for Secretary. And Pacific for specific. Both heard on the Beeb in the last couple of days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley Well, it's given you a benchmark of sorts to work against. By comparison, wood and slate ski chalets are pretty acceptable 😳😳<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Fileybirder @YWTLivingSeas @YCNature @VisitYNT @FlamboroughBird @NorthSeaWT It's the thought that counts. Those bs and ps can be a real bugger to get right 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can anyone recommend a lightweight scope tripod pls? The old one is getting rather wearisome to lug around. 😳😳🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley To be clear, that's the Long Tailed Parrot billed Tit, not you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CABS_REPORTS @Fileybirder There is something deeply sad about a robin in this state- our traditional Xmas card, winter bird. Truly shocking. Keep up the good work and stay safe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley Just very, very wrong. And a little disturbing 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EYbirder @RoutledgeSteve @mcsuk I'm working on getting our local Farm Shop to swap from foam plastic produce trays to pulped card. Samples arriving tomorrow. Wish me luck 🤔🤔😳#NoBrainer #PlasticPollution<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley Yes, but just think of all that lovely mining that can now take place. The man is an utter cultural vandal with no sense of awe, history, beauty or "place".  Must be marvellous to be him. Shakes head in despair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WildlifeTrusts @Fileybirder A certain well known Scandinavian store does rolls of brown paper for gift wrapping - and other colours may be available too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcesherwood I trust there are plenty folk out there keeping a close eye on him. One foot out of place....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MyWakefield Does this constitute Fly Tipping or 'Litter'? Whatever, it's unacceptable and needs clearing if possible! #Pugneys #Portobello  https://t.co/lrVpObwhC9<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@birdingetc @MarkAvery @RaptorPersScot @_robsheldon I can't believe a) the number of birds in that photo and b) the fact that they took the time to arrange them meticulously, like an art installation. Unbelievable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leicester_llama We've lost 3 in the area. 'Ours' will def close early next year if they can't sell it -it's a house extension and no one wants house plus PO 😕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leicester_llama Oh, and be glad you've even got a Post Office. We're about to lose ours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leicester_llama My ever busy daughter says that all retirees (me included) should be BANNED from shops at the weekend as we can shop during the week 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShotShy @Recordshotmyars No, obviously the Jay was very badly blurred but the GSW photo bombed the picture. 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirdTrack Mine were our local Little Owl catching a bit of winter sun and a tiny Goldfinch 'working' an oak tree. Expected the Owl but not the wee un. #Pugneys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nataliefee  https://t.co/OXWt4fwku5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sue_lees @coopukfood @RefillBath Indeed. If you buy them from a 'chain' baker, they'll probably be in a recyclable foil 'cup' and then be popped into a paper bag. You just have to be trusted not to sit on them 🙄🙄 #PlasticPollution #MincePies<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AnnieMai8 @jonnybirder @BenGoldsmith @Team4Nature300 Worth contacting local Food Standards. They don't like 'anonymous' food items being sold. Some form of contact is required. #ReindeerFood<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BBCRadio4 Hi. Could someone please tell me what the intro and closing music is for the radio drama "Rogue Male" on iPlayer pls? Think it was also used for radio Crime drama Insp.Julie Enfield "The Net and the Canal"?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Thaily @CABS_REPORTS As I've said before, this isn't hunting- it's target practice. None of these was destined for the pot.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WfldPeregrines @cameronlee1959 Yes, I've seen the Peregrines over Pugneys and CalderWetlands. Just not many waders though!! Too many dogs in the water.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Stooooman @BirdTrack I do that. It's not him, but a local group for our little patch.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Stooooman @BirdTrack I might be able to read the spreadsheets more easily on the laptop screen. Want to provide data for the local Bird Report and don't keep paper records 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkAvery Can you give a rough idea of the number of game birds released annually in the UK for shooting please? 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stooooman @BirdTrack Right. I'll move from the iPad to the laptop then. I assumed it'd be possible, but I'd have spent hours looking. Always ask politely and someone will know the answer!! Many thanks 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimothyOcealla2 @Bird_Crime @BillAspin 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimothyOcealla2 @Bird_Crime @BillAspin I wasn't. I was asking how many game birds are released annually for target practice.  Trying to get an accurate figure 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirdTrack Is there any way I can access all my records for my patch for 2016, rather than just a First Date Seen for each species?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bird_Crime @BillAspin Have you got your zeros right? Are we talking in the UK? Cos that's 40 million game birds 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley If that doesn't exist somewhere on the planet, it jolly well should do. #Kingpecker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bird_Crime @BillAspin As a genuine question, how many actually are released? Does anyone know? Grouse, Pheasant and RLPartridge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DerwentBirder You've brought her up 'proper'. Good lass 🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LincsRuralCrime @BillAspin So what happens to the vehicle if/when it's located?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guardiannews @SteelySeabirder 36 million birds disappearing in the Med every year. 36 million!! I can't begin to imagine what that looks like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrishilder @simmonite_dave Appalling.  I remember the absolute pleasure and joy of watching an #Osprey at #RSPB FairburnIngs and feeling very privileged to see one on our neck of the woods. What has happened to this one is diabolical.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@slidinsam @SteelySeabirder It was hard to tell. Obv it had been knocked around but at v least had disintegrated in parts- so the little bits end up...,, ?? 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wildwood_photos @ceeste45 Translates roughly as- Brazilian fishermen pull their net from the sea and Boom! There are more #PlasticBags than fish on the net. It's estimated that by 2050 there'll be more plastic than fish in the sea - or will it happen sooner?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@brucecothinks @WeWantPlates Too big for a plate!!  At least it's sensibly presented and on clean paper. And no fries in a trolley or coleslaw in a shoe 😱😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lincsbirders @RoutledgeSteve @birdersagainst @PC_Rural It speaks of someone who shouldn't have been let anywhere near a gun. IF you are going to hunt, then you should do so as humanely as possible. And that is nowhere near. And I speak as someone who has never held a gun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fhickenbottom @StevieD131 It looks remarkably like a pork scratching 😱😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProbableBS Me again sorry. Any chance of a V neck Hawfinch tee shirt option please? 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoutledgeSteve What app/gizmo are you using? I'm looking for an accurate pedometer. OH and I do same walk and check distance on our iPhones' Health app. Can vary by 30% 😳🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProbableBS Article about the Hawfinch irruption this morning on R4 Today. Also explained the Latin name - seed cracker - but no mention of #YorkshireArboretum sadly as a place to see them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gov considering tax on single use plastic food containers/trays. #WetherbyWhaler use cardboard ones for their fishnchips and they're brill. Paper bags too. It can be done👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@badukemi @A_48er @tisILeclerc @sturdyAlex @jgraddon I do remember paying taxes for nearly 40 years while I was working. Or doesn't that count? And a lot of youngsters failed to turn out and vote Remain. Don't blame us oldies for everything, please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder @jonnybirder So probably the only birds now to be found there will be pigeons and seagulls 🙄😉😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder @jonnybirder It's developed by Peel Estates who have proposed the controversial plans for Liverpool Dock area which is jeopardising its World Heritage Status. And if you stop anywhere on their industrial park road which abuts CalderWetlands you get £100 fine. Marvellous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder @jonnybirder Yes. Now a mega ArnoldClark showroom. Hundreds of cars and the place lit up like Blackpool. Drove past last night for first time since it opened. Could have wept.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Remember where you found your Blyth's Pipit? Well look at the place now. #LightPollution #CarShowroom  😳  https://t.co/OH0RoxqnUQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Forgot to address it to you 🙄  https://t.co/im3BHilWun<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Saw your car at end of lane when I went out. I'm still looking for Fieldfare. Wondering what's Norwegian in your tweet that needs translating??😳😳🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CABS_REPORTS And there is one reason why I won't be visiting #Malta on holiday @VisitMalta<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankRGardner Bee-eaters. My favourite birds. The ones in Sri Lanka sit and pose for pictures. Wonderful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankRGardner Watched the amazing #BirdsofParadise prog with you and Benedict Allen - trust he's rescued safe and well. We need more like him!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andyhood75 The man has no idea. He is without a clue. He has no moral compass. If a gun is involved, the activity is sacrosanct #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder @MyWakefield @MaureenCumming @wakeynats @jon_trickett @Wintersett1 Do you think they have any idea?? Will it cost more money?? 🙄🙄Have they been informed an alternative is possible? #Swifts #Wildlife #Environment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Well I'll get there in the morning hopefully! Think I've ticked all them. Pleased Barn Owl still present. Loads of Chiffs in #Cyprus in the 🌞🌞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RareBirdAlertUK Rather surprised that great swathes of North Yorkshire aren't on the map. Farm shops and pubs sell/serve game at this time of year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ORachaelO Can I make a suggestion? If you've no longer got a parent at Xmas, buy Xmas dinner for a homeless person via #Crisis in their name. It helps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ORachaelO I sat in a quiet corner of M&amp;S and cried the Christmas after I lost my Mum and Dad. Not just me then 🙁🙁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley I'm unsure whether it's Gullfinch or inventabird that Twitter is offering to translate from Swedish 🙄😳🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@durosekevin @andyhood75 Can you spell "Remembrance", @mariacaulfield? I buy a poppy every year and invariably lose it 5 minutes later.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DJRBirder @jonnybirder We do a 2 min daily beach clean when we're on holiday. Reactions vary from "Thanks" to puzzled looks. #BluePlanet #PlasticPollution #GetOnWithIt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RSPBMinsmere @RareBirdAlertUK I'd suggest entering it for the #Countryfile Calendar. But on the other hand, neither of them is laughing 😱#TooGruesome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProbableBS I'll wait then! 🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProbableBS Yes please to a v neck if possible. Dare I also say that I preferred the original design. No pleasing some folk 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VictoriaCoren @missmagpirate Indeed. They require brevity and tailoring. Rather like a haiku. I'm sticking to 140 regardless. Say NO to 280!! 😡😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CABS_REPORTS @simmonite_dave The things that some humans do in the pursuit of pleasure is beyond words at times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@createdsummer @RaptorPersScot Clot indeed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LushTimesEN @mn_reeder @CABS_REPORTS @SpnlOrg Genuine question. Can I ask what level of education is going on in the country as to the effects of such indiscriminate hunting? Is it being highlighted nationally? #Lebanon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DominicCouzens @Recordshotmyars Nearly as good as the Turn on the Information Board courtesy of WMDC at #CalderWetlands. I need to get down there with my indelible pen 😡 #pedant #GetItRight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoutledgeSteve @jonnybirder There's no answer to that! 😱😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoutledgeSteve @jonnybirder I know. I was winding @jonnybirder up for a change 😉😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@missmagpirate Q. What's brown and sticky? A.  A stick. Just thought I'd mention that oldie but goodie 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jake_Gearty @Recordshotmyars Is this one of those Magic Eye pictures??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder This is me you're talking to. I'll just say 'Redshank' to you 🙄🙄I'll have a close look at the next 20 I see. What are the possibilities? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder I did read up about what may/should be about in this area and GSP were mentioned. Every Stonechat on the planet is here, crested lark, blk redstart etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Well not Pugneys that's for sure 🙄🙄Paphos in Cyprus. Still some interesting birds around that haven't been trapped and eaten 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Greater Sand Plover? Best I could do at a distance without breaking a leg on rocks 🙄  https://t.co/dNmwYLUWaK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Not sure if I can legitimately tick this (very much live) pelican🤔🙄espec as it wouldn't let me past 😱  https://t.co/6mgx4G0Qob<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ornid Do what my OH did and take up cycling. Far less of a strain. Except on the wallet 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RuthTingay @jeanthorpeRR Can I just say it makes me embarrassed and sad to be connected to the county #Yorkshire<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBC @rdh_rob @bbc5live What's the possibility it's been dumped by cruise ships? A strange sight to see so much plastic tableware 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackSnipe222 Please sort out that Hanging Clause. Hawfinch don't do Art while looking out of the window.  #Pedantry 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhysicusUK Wrong. Fake News The family haven't lived there in many years. It's now owned by a restoration Trust. Google it. It's a fantastic building in desperate need of TLC #Rotherham<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RSPBArne Just stop it now. 140 is enough for anybody. 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@housesinmunich Ian thought you'd like this. X  https://t.co/zvoot0F4Tg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carolanlockett @Rachael_Swindon @jonnybirder Not at all. I find the young man's situation truly shocking. And it's not just him. I despair it can be handled so badly and wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carolanlockett @Rachael_Swindon @jonnybirder I wasn't. You misunderstand. I was saying that very under qualified people seem to be doing the job and that I would seem to fit that bill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HanbyAndrew @RoutledgeSteve I could cry. Better than another car showroom as per #CalderWetlands is all I can say. Barbarism. Sod the cakes #Spurn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carolanlockett @Rachael_Swindon @jonnybirder Says it all. I can clean a graze and put on a plaster. Can I apply??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IHateCilantro @TheTweetOfGod No, if the writer doesn't know his apostrophe usage, which is Grammar. So God is right. Phew.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirdwatchExtra Sacrificing irreplaceable habitat to profit for USA millionaires. If this gets the go ahead, Scotland should be ashamed of itself. #golf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mark__Lawrence I can't begin to imagine why anyone would steal specialised medical equipment. Hope it turns up discarded somewhere. Good luck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Any sign of Fieldfare around the patch? I don't think I saw one last winter 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Waitrose @Natures_Voice Worth a look?? #PlasticFree  https://t.co/h1TSGlfK5j<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AttenboroughNR @BillAspin Right. Take one down to #Costa, #CaffeNero, #Starbucks and every bluddy petrol/service station you can find and show them the future. 😳😳👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frankieboyle Unless of course you read the #DailyMail or believe Christopher Booker, in which case it's all Fake News promoted by Sir David and the BBC 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rachael_Swindon @jonnybirder I think it says more about the quality of some of the assessors. Would it be unreasonable to expect them to be fully medically qualified?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SBOmad Just that most of us avoid tax by saving in an ISA, not by having our money channelled to the Cayman Islands 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SBOmad I think many agree. They'd avoid paying tax if possible. Don't equate paying tax with funding hospitals, schools, public services etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rob_yaxley @MJLbirder Absolutely 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Recordshotmyars Can't, I assume 🤔😉😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 @YorksArboretum Glad you get to see them. There were dozens yesterday, but the weather in the morning was rather grey. Well that's my excuse for my photos 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leedsbirder @simmonite_dave @YorksArboretum They kept coming in yesterday from mid morning 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jw4926 @jonnybirder @RaptorPersScot I agree. I was commenting more on his ignorance of the term.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jw4926 @jonnybirder @RaptorPersScot I suspect he thinks Magpies and Crows are Birds of Prey. I had 15 Magpies in the field behind us last week and they do like baby birds. 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 @nybirdnews @YorksArboretum We were there about 10:30 after the rain eased off and it was pretty dreich as the Scots would say. At least the sun came out later 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nybirdnews @flako1959 @YorksArboretum That's early enough for me.... 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 @nybirdnews @YorksArboretum Some of us were there early doors! #Hawfinches #YorkshireArboretum<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At last! An article on this evening's BBC News re #BalloonReleases and the damage they cause. More publicity please 🎈🎈🎈🐠🐳🐬🐄🐎🐑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@missmagpirate @historylvrsclub @ChrisGPackham He probably saw it as his last meal ever. And that egg yolk is ENORMOUS 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leedsbirder @YorksArboretum @HawfinchesUK It was very gloomy there this morning and when it did brighten up, the sun was behind them. At least that's my excuse for some cr@p photos 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoutledgeSteve 😱😱😳😳🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Hawfinch lifer at last. Lots of them here at Castle Howard Arboretum. Deep joy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoutledgeSteve Dry and vaguely light here at #YorkshireArboretum. Several #Hawfinch feeding on hornbeams. Totally off patch but a #lifer so who cares 🤗🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LettersDesk If matters progress as they are, it may be the case that Harvey Weinstein has accidentally brought down the Government 🤔🤔😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulEele @biggesttwitch That is definitely a bird designed and produced by Disney. Unbelievably beautiful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NathanielDargue @nybirdnews @SBOmad @YorkBirding @YorksArboretum @BirdGuides @RareBirdAlertUK Will be there in the morning as soon as the rain passes over. Thanks for the annotated map. 👍👍Fingers crossed they're still hungry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jgsigsworth I'll just look out for a load of blokes with bins and scopes and head in their direction 🤔 Fingers crossed.  I've never ever seen one. 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder Mr Little Owl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillAspin @jonnybirder No. Not one. There will be this weekend as I'm up in NYorkshire. Hopefully will track one or more down (off patch) at #YorkshireArboretum 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YorksArboretum @jonnybirder @HawfinchesUK @nybirdnews Please tell them to hang around until tomorrow when I can get there. They are under no circumstances to leave. 😱😳 #Hawfinchinvasion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Protect_Wldlife @ceeste45 Just think. He could've taken a load of photos to share and left the creature for others to enjoy. Words fail me. #SnowLeopard<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My favourite card ever 😂😂  https://t.co/1VCb0rycpY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lizardschwartz And my advice is to keep talking to people and get yourself out for walks whenever possible. Nature is kind to the soul.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder @BirdGuides OH rode thru Badsworth last week and said how 'nice' it is. Big houses with big gardens. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder @BirdGuides I see they're sticking to the posh addresses then 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonburkeUK @simmonite_dave Very difficult, expensive and disruptive to remove stumps and to replace. Suspect they'll just be left. A sorry sight indeed 🙁@sheffcouncil<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RareBirdAlertUK @simmonite_dave Grey Partridge for me 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fidhw @ProbableBS Mine lives on the kitchen wall #TalkingPoint<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevieD131 @YoloBirder Apparently it's low level. I despair. #Litter #Unnecessary #ChokeHazard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MickgCunningham It's a variety of Miscanthus grass. I have smaller varieties in the garden. Chop it to ground level and it regrows. Tough as old boots<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Recordshotmyars One for your adjudication methinks. #RecordShot????  https://t.co/umWxSLsZOu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 @jonnybirder Good job it wasn't my sighting. I'd have said, Thats different, and then not had a clue. And then not believed it when I'd done a poss ID 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 7 with Mistle being harassed by magpie. Long time no see. Used to be hundreds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Have you picked up the Golden Plover below Castle? With solitary Lapwing on its 3rd day 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 👍👍👍The covey of 6 seem not to have noticed its different! Thanks #PatchTick #Pugneys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Or rather Castle no-pond field. 🙄 Thanks for the heads up 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillAspin Did you say HAWFINCH, you lucky man? 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnnymacbirder Numerous Redwing here at #Pugneys on the hawthorn bushes; I'll follow your advice, though I just know......🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder Just a totally gobsmackingly amazing hour of TV. Deep respect to the camera operators especially the surfing dolphin footage. Scary!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Finally found the Pintail on res lake. If you see the RLP, let me know where pls! Epic fail 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnnEllis6 Have read several articles about the #BF clearing the area. Some locals very angry and aggressive. Not an easy job. Birds=money<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnnEllis6 @bfcyprus @ChrisGPackham @Natures_Voice They plant bushes to hide mist nets to trap birds. These irrigate the bushes. It's a massive area to monitor. 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NCambsHuntSabs @simmonite_dave There are some things I would rather unsee. This is one of them. Charming. 😳😳<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Rowanyaxley And I think Twitter knows the answer to No3. #Inventabird<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Lophophanes @YoloBirder I've never ever seen one, ever ever. And if one flew overhead, I'd miss it 🙄🙄 #Hawfinches<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andyhood75 @FlamboroughBird @YWTLivingSeas @waderquest Several along the Whitby - RH Bay coastal path on Monday, including a couple coming in off the sea #Curlew<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@whitfieldbenson Would it not be better just to talk to the store manager or have you tried that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tesconews Chris - I'll gladly DM you with details but you need to follow me if I'm to do so. I'm following you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MickgCunningham 2/2 until his 66th then changed as it rocketed up. Found one on MoneySupermarket. Not sure who; will ask the #oldgimmer when he comes in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MickgCunningham 1/2 As a nearly old gimmer (aka Saga Totty according to my dear husband), the cut off seems to be your 66th birthday. We used Great Cover<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HughsWaronWaste Had a positive response from #Sainsburys who say they are considering it. Fingers crossed 🙂🤔  https://t.co/jEQCc07zGg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sainsburys 2/2 and thank you for your reply. Sadly, @tesconews have ignored it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sainsburys Yes it does. Anything to reduce the use of #plasticwaste is to be commended. I hope Sainsburys leads the way on this. It needs urgent action<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder @BirdGuides I'm going to come and stand in your garden. I've never knowingly seen a #Hawfinch 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_BTO One was rather noisy about 1pm yesterday. I must admit I did a double take as it was an odd time #Tawnies #NorthYorkshire<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sainsburys Thank you Liz. This is just a positive step beyond dreaded one use bags. Surely it's the way to go? The big guys need to lead the way here 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Any further news on CM's insect bites? Did she go to the GP?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Garwolin @CABS_REPORTS @simmonite_dave They're considered a delicacy in our garden too -to watch though, not to eat. Happy to have seen 15 on Whitby Coastal Path yesterday #robins<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CABS_REPORTS @simmonite_dave Thank you. Wish they'd eat 'polenta senza uccelli'. On the same lines as the dreaded Ambelopoulia I assume.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CABS_REPORTS @simmonite_dave Genuine question from the mystified. What was the trapper doing with the dead robins? Too small for food, so?? Beyond belief😳😳<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder @carly86marie @spurnbirdobs Have you any more idea? Odd that there are 2 bites thru her jeans. Seems more like an insect has been trapped inside + allergic reaction?1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeWantPlates @Trowners How on earth could you wash that properly for next time?  Food Standards would have a fit 😱😳🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheTrisReid @Jonny09Jonny Indeed. Walked up from Boot &amp; the gusts were nearly blowing us over even at low level. Lashing rain swept in so we stayed low #SafetyFirst<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonny09Jonny @TheTrisReid #StormBrian beat us. 😱🙄 Common sense demanded we postpone Scafell for another day. Serious winds and rain. Low level walk instead #CreamTea<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheTrisReid @Jonny09Jonny You might think that- i couldn't possibly comment, as the man said. With tomorrow's weather ... 😱😱😱🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Would be good to see a little colony developing round here #TreeSparrow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RebelBM666 Not possible. Just look around your home, car, workplace and see what is made of #plastic. Not just bottles. It's a massive problem.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@simon_reeve Watching your conversation with Tatiana who said, 'There's politics and then there's us'. What a brilliant summary. #Russia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder Me too, and it was you who pointed me in the direction of the Uni waxwings when I was in the Toon last winter. 🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder You sounded very serious and grown up on the radio 🤔 How many "takes" were required?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder "Birdwatching's irreverent Tweeter" 🤔 according to BBC Radio4. What a monicker! #TweetOfTheDay #Redwing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Sit down and cuddle your daughter. And realise what a lucky man you are.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lizardschwartz Nearly tripping over a Frog-mouthed Owl when walking the base of Uluru. Sorry for the name dropping.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonny09Jonny @BridgedaleSocks I've got to stagger up Scafell on Saturday 😱😱 as OH has kept it as his final Wainwright; I've told him I'm NOT carrying the champagne 🙄😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mn_reeder @Gone_Birding Apparently dust from Portuguese forest fires are causing the red sun, according to weather guru #PaulHudson @Hudsonweather<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jo_birding @simmonite_dave Cut them down or grubbed them out?  I've cut our hawthorn right back to encourage it to thicken up. Needs to be done now nesting is over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stoptheshoot @simmonite_dave I wish someone could invent a system for shooting non- living things made of, say, clay. No, wait.... 🤔🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@9stan @YorksWildlife Martin- dong you realise that birds keep office hours? Who could possibly want to be there after 5pm??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LettersDesk And in pockets of rarely worn coats and jackets #RoundPounds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder If only #Warblers stuck to those rules 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Recordshotmyars If that's a #RecordShot, god help the rest of us 🙄🙄😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrBanham @mn_reeder Unbelievable. Literally jaw dropping. How many Goldfinches are being released? Well done and thanks to the Guardian Civil #Spain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder I'll. be listening on catch-up. 05:58 is a little too early even for your dulcet tones😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Recordshotmyars Is there any standing room left on #StAgnes?? 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Only teasing but well done!! 🤗🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 @MalleyAndrew This year?? 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Red_eyed_Video @wildlifebcn #Pugneys oak trees have had a bumper acorn year. There are 4 Jays collecting them non stop. And squirrels too 🙄Sloe bushes look good as well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AgainstHunting I agree re gun ownership. However, I'd rather fewer people, not more, knew this guy's whereabouts. Some would find his hoard very tempting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeWantPlates @pollianicus Utterly, utterly ridiculous. Broken glass and food most certainly do not go together. Food Standards should stop this ridiculosity. 🙄😱😡😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AgainstHunting I'm a little concerned that you have made this man's address even more public and therefore his guns more accessible to criminals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Barn Owl still at back of farm this evening   Perched half way up chimney,18:30. Showed well 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Memeulous @jonnybirder And they say they want to give the vote to 16 year olds. Truly terrifying 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder That's pretty grim.... 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeanthorpeRR Jean, could you please follow me so I can DM you? Thanks 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LDV_NNR @nybirdnews @RosewoodFarms @YorkBirding @iNatureUK We have up to 25 in the fields on patch in a good year. I'd rather it was no longer legal to shoot them, however. Numbers are not strong 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackLabrador10 @ceeste45 Sadly, these robins were snared in Italy. This sort of thing happens across the Med, not just Malta and Cyprus. How to change this mindset??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bfpjohn @CABS_REPORTS @SuffolkNature Yes. They are caught for a trad dish called Ambelpoulia. Very pop with certain tourists especially Russians apparently who pay big money 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirdLife_Malta @simmonite_dave Wanton target practice. If it moves, shoot it and bugger the consequences. Visit Malta? Not while this sort of thing goes on. Shame.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Trying to work out what the farmer is doing there. No pond at the moment! Willow scrub partly grubbed up 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Still searching for that RLP with no joy however. Was it on ploughed fields?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Barn Owl has moved. Just flown into top'arrow slit' window end of long building (from tarmac path  )<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CABS_REPORTS @simmonite_dave Words utterly fail me. Who on God's earth would trap and kill robins? Unbelievable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Barn Owl in same window 18:45 tonight. Then swept down and away 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder It's taken me ages to work out your hashtag here 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TicesBirder When we did that 15 yrs ago, we nearly trod on a Frog-mouthed Owl, as I believe it was called. Resting in the shade. #Uluru<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CllrTim @mn_reeder Seriously, I don't know who Mrs May's stylist is, but that person must be a Labour supporter. That jacket is criminally dreadful 😱😱<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Fileybirder Saw someone yest lunchtime on a mega motortrike near the Country Park who looked like your photo. No helmet which is how I could see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fileybirder Evening Mr P. Do you happen to ride an interesting motorbike around Filey?  🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SBOmad @yoavperlman I hope this is not fake news. Lock him up. And take his Landrover off him too. He's not fit to own one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Reign_86_ @BillAspin @afneil 2/2 believe our no gun attitude and can't believe we're 'safe' without one. It's madness. But how was the hotel to spot what he was doing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Reign_86_ @BillAspin @afneil Yes I did. I've talked to Americans - nice ladies- about their 'need' to have a gun and the fact I've never even held a gun. They can't 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Reign_86_ @BillAspin @afneil I must say my bags have never been checked in any hotel I've stayed in. It just doesn't happen. How can they?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder @KerrieDoodles They're probably just ridiculously easy to shoot. As I said, not hunting, just target practice 😡😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder And as a Landie owner, I'm most upset that he uses one to display his utter bellendery as you put it. That's rather reserved, methinks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder I really think this article was written and submitted for a bet. That, or a desperate lack of bird news that month #Sandwiches<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisGPackham Target practice. Not hunting. And not worth blobbing out his face as it's out there already. Vile, vile man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bethreeder_ It'll give you time to take your Dad birding at Morecambe bay if you're at Lancaster. 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrianLee50 @Fitzybirder @CroftonBirder If you want a creepy read, the Hitch film is based on The Birds by Daphne Du Maurier. Worth the read. #scary<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@makinthemost A bloody good cup of tea. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bethreeder_ Erm, they expect you to grab the reading list and go live in the Library. What are you 'reading' as they say on University Challenge?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder @spurnbirdobs The thing is, you need almost as much for one night as for a week 🙄. It gets easier.......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dozens of #Swifts feeding low over the field at the bottom of the garden. Sparrows cleaning up greenfly  in border #BedroomBirdwatching<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Richardpboon @JohnLawArt @mick_turton If I am, I won't be best pleased. I was very polite. 🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@YorksWildlife In what way does this advice relate to #Spurn please?  https://t.co/dIBA2u87fv<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>When I said yesterday that #Prague is a Sparrow-free place, I was wrong. I saw one (1) this morning. Loads of hirundines by the river though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder Look at her profile. She's a PR consultant 🙄🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Unlikely. Acc to Audubon, it's mainly E &amp; Central &amp; a rare winter visitor on W Coast. Plus it's blue, not black. And she won't have a pic 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right, Twitter. Daughter is in N California and has seen 'a blackbirdy thing with a blue head and a mohican'. Any ideas?? 🤔🤔🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Prague. A Sparrow-free city. Millions of pigeons everywhere. 😱 Screaming Swifts, and Sand Martins on the river, so not all bad.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Fileybirder Are there any copies of the 2015 report still available please?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@estwebber @BillAspin A cracking line #DennisSkinner. Probably exactly what her Maj was thinking too. I suspect they all need a touch of humour at the moment.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Trolleywise @AsdaServiceTeam We seem to be going round in circles, Asda. It's been a month now. What do u suggest?  Shall I drag the trolleys out myself &amp; dump in store?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"May you live in interesting times" Chinese proverb. Hold tight, things are going to get very interesting 😱😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, who's going to be the next Tory leader? #chopchop #exitpolls<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@missmagpirate So all in all, that's turned a bad day into a good day. Or at least a better one. 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AsdaServiceTeam @Trolleywise Are u saying that @Trolleywise are now contracted to #Wakefield store? Because 3 weeks ago they told me that they were not and couldn't help<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickc909 @JamesGoyder @OwenJones84 @kevinmitchell50 We grannies understand it's our civic duty 2 vote. Who I vote for is my concern only, but please don't paint us oldies as all racist #insult<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2/2 @asda that it would receive his prompt attention. That was last Thursday. What more can I do? Poor publicity and poor customer relations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Asda I'm still here, waiting for the 2 trolleys in the stream to be removed. My local Councillor was promised by Dep Manager #Wakefield 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_BTO I've heard more wrens this year than ever, even in the local Aldi car park. Lots in suitable nesting places.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mn_reeder The only thing I can say is that if the paper is unusually difficult, the marks to grade outcome is usually more generous. Don't panic yet!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@David_Ruston22 @RoutledgeSteve Not what I said at all. I was simply saying that many Syrians live in terror of them. Look at the footage of Raqqua. They don't want more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@David_Ruston22 @RoutledgeSteve You think your average Syrian would want them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mn_reeder @theresa_may I do think you're on to something there. Except she's not quite nailed the Twitter thing yet. And her husband isn't as scary as Melania 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mn_reeder @theresa_may Interesting that the word Conservative/s does not appear. Have we suddenly changed to voting for a Prime Minister &amp; not our constituency MP?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Duncbye @YorkBirding Still not heard a cuckoo here at #Pugneys this year 😕😕<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@missmagpirate No I don't think so. You just have to bite the bullet and get rid, sadly, or you're in for problems, trust me. I speak from experience 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 I'll have to come up some time and take a look how it's done.  The pink one is exquisite 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@missmagpirate Find jam jar. Half fill with water. Add half an inch veg oil. Find little stick. Knock LB into jar. Put lid on. Better than squishing them😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@missmagpirate You need to get rid of them. ASAP. They lay eggs, the eggs are tiny then turn into a revolting huge grey sticky mass under the leaves 😱😱<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@milly883 @MalleyAndrew Yes, a guy posted yesterday that he'd lost it. He described the camera and location. I'll try and find the tweet and reply again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AsdaServiceTeam Aisling, if you manage to get someone to remove the trolleys, you'll be a miracle worker. Good luck and thanks.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AsdaServiceTeam Hi Clare. I've been in store and reported it on Sat but nothing's happened again. Across field behind store then follow path to bridge.  🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And, @Asda, here's the new one further downstream. And no, Trolleywise can't help. #Wakefield #Community #Eyesores  https://t.co/knUOfSaZYo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Asda here's the trolley that's been in the stream for 2 weeks now. Despite several requests to move it, still there😡  https://t.co/FoocFMA7J2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wilki31 @Hudsonweather Fahrenheit is more evocative for hot weather. - oooh! In the 80s!! - but Celsius does the cold end- ergh, minus 5! Keep them both!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guardianeco Because she had influential friends in the Antique Ivory trade. Who are, no doubt, Tory Party donors. QED<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HughHarrop Ah, but it's tradition. Like Spring Hunting of songbirds in the Mediterranean. So that makes it acceptable. Apparently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@missmagpirate I'm old. What's deathhawking? If you don't like it, will it take forever to grow out? Just asking 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alanshearer MOTD2 'Could HAVE and should HAVE' please, not OF. Get it right! #Grammar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GusTheFox @YoloBirder So the Antiques Trade has special influence. Wonder how much money she's donated to the Tory Party. Shame on them both #IvoryTrade<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WYP_WakefieldR Hi. How can I persuade Asda to retrieve 'liberated' trolleys please? I'm fed up of asking nicely #eyesore #BigLitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mn_reeder And a bottle of strategically placed Hendos to boot. Yum 🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AsdaServiceTeam @Trolleywise No they can't. We've been here before. They're not contracted to Wakefield store. It needs someone to walk 5 mins &amp; collect it #infuriating<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Asda Me again. Trolley still in beck 18:00 yesterday despite reporting in store. Plus these 2 in field behind store🙄  https://t.co/nphwqwq5Jy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StevieD131 @WakeExpress And a PCSO would have slapped her with a £50 fine. The general public sadly seem quite immune to litter, if #Pugneys is anything to go by 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gazpic @JohnLawArt @ChrisGPackham @MarkAvery @charliemoores Hurry up and get that tea room built!  And the coach park! Can't wait!! 😡😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevieD131 @WakeExpress And the sad thing is, we're supposed to be impressed. Long distance litter. Fortunately picked up by a human, not an animal. #Balloons<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AsdaServiceTeam Thanks Beth. I've been in and reported it to Customer Services. Hopefully that'll get it sorted - till the next one, inevitably. #trolleys<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gazpic @jonnybirder @spurnbirdobs By the looks of today's flood of criticism, YWT will be blocking most birders in the North.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JonScoff @calvindenni @SBOmad @LabourEoin @bbckamal @Telegraph Trouble is, 'Margaret from Ken' has her letter read by 480,000, so she's pretty influential in that respect. Sadly many will agree with her<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonScoff @calvindenni @SBOmad @LabourEoin @bbckamal You obviously don't read @Telegraph letters where Laura is vilified, for want of a better word.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@calvindenni @SBOmad @LabourEoin @JonScoff @bbckamal All a matter of opinion. Laura Kuhnessberg has been accused of being the official opposition to the Tory party. The BBC can't win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder 2/2 round back of fish lake. More suitable for a prison!! Plus your Blyths wasteland cleared for a car showroom. I could cry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Yes. All literally hacked away incl tree top left which is an utter mess. Not even properly sawn down. Whose land? Mega fence going up 1/2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PottericBirder @mick_turton @Gone_Birding @spurnbirdobs I question the legality of the situation. No different to rail track maintenance Co who were on #LookNorth last week for doing the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LettersDesk Someone has to do the job and she's pretty clued up and able. Can she now please discover who turned Mrs May into a robot? #laurakuenssberg<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Trolleywise Thank you for getting back to me re #AsdaWakefield.  Judging by the number of wandering trolleys, they need to sign you up 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirdGuides We have 6+ local cats that wander our garden at all times of day and night. And crap on the lawn/veg beds. And chase birds 😱🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillAspin Sorted. Thanks. At least I don't get the withering look from you. Or if I do, I can't see it 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillAspin Hmm. I'll look for that wee button then and click it 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillAspin No- Twitter update 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillAspin Twitter photos sorted. Daughter took phone, found update needed, updated, handed phone back with withering look. #Shame<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NicolaHanrahan Haven't forgotten about the cattery. Asked John who was asking his wife (boss). Don't see him often but I'll prompt him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicolaHanrahan Couldn't see it properly on your stand photo and thought it was a decorated bird box 🙄 Sorry! X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicolaHanrahan Nikki can you send me a close up pic of your bird box if you still have it please?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ceeste45 Feel like some interfering old biddy but am absolutely bloody fizzing. Will contact local policing team next if nothing happens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ceeste45 Here's today's offering. Trolleys plus 2 boxes 🍻 cans/bottles from @asda Have contacted local councillor 🙄  https://t.co/OgL7MPDxny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trolleywise Hi I've reported 2 dumped trolleys to Asda. D'you collect in Wakefield area? I have location details<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ceeste45 Looks like we're both doing trolley battles with #Asda. They've taken the 'pound slot' off the Wakey ones so they're free to roam😠<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@asda Your trolleys STILL in the stream near #Asda Wakefield They need removing please @MyWakefield  https://t.co/yYJG124U9Y<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnnymacbirder Drive a Defender and you always have a bug splattered windscreen. It's the angle 😳🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillAspin 10.1.1. iPhone 5 I think. One day photos, none the next apart from yours! It has been on holiday where I turn data roaming off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ceeste45 @AsdaServiceTeam Worse since they've removed the 'pound chains' so they're free. Keep finding them in the field too #trolleys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.Can anyone tell me why my iPhone is suddenly not displaying photos, just a grey box? 😠🤔 How do I remedy it??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leicester_llama @missmagpirate What I assumed but it's a bu66er if you're paying full whack and can't have a shower.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AsdaServiceTeam In the past, i've called into store to tell them and they've sent someone down. It's a 2 min walk. #Wakefield #AsdaleRoad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Imagine being called Dingy.  What a sad name indeed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@missmagpirate So the next step is withholding rent? What can you legally do? Your dog could slobber him to death I suppose 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@missmagpirate What's gone wrong? No hot water?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@AsdaServiceTeam 2 trolleys in stream by bridge near #Wakefield store.  Could someone retrieve please?  https://t.co/pwgvV05bW8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 'Felled' bird on Pole 17 looks like an Oyk. No scope with me as on way to work #CalderWetlands<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mn_reeder It is a bit of cutting of nose to spite face ie other YWT places deprived of cash, but how else to make a principled stand?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gazpic @mn_reeder I would agree, but for some, money is the be all and end all. They're never getting another penny from me, sadly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirdwatchExtra @robnitm Love the 'Liver Sosage' label. Don't think I'd want to eat it though....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gazpic @mn_reeder I'd be interested to know how many people have not renewed their membership since the Spurn debacle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@missmagpirate I pick up the cans n bottles left by the 'party scrotes' by a bridge on patch. Stops them being chucked into the stream 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@missmagpirate Bite the bullet. Grab a heavy duty bin bag and a rake. The grass'll soon grow once the cr@p has been moved. #SocialConscience<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChrisGPackham Good luck Chris. You look suitably (🙄) smart for what is an unjust situation. Remind them of the effects on Tourism too 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillAspin Looking forward to seeing you on #Strictly in 2018, Bill, then maybe #BakeOff. The world, as they say, is your lobster 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 @jonnybirder Thanks Mick ! Sorted 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Morning. Sorry to bother you but do u have yr hand drawn map of Pugneys electronically to hand?  If so, could you pls tweet it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisGPackham Don't panic! Boris Johnson will be along soon to rescue you! Seriously, it's a disgrace, but not unexpected #Don'tVisitMalta<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fairburnjohng @RSPBAireValley I enjoyed hearing the Booming Bittern on the Coal Tips trail - what a privilege ! 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fisermanian Exactly where it was 2 yrs ago 👍. Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fisermanian Any clue to where you found the gropper? #Pugneys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flako1959 I'm an apostrophe nut &amp; ex-MFL teacher. I long to reach for the tippex when I see Panini's. It's simple: 1 panino, 2 panini. 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnTobytyke Thank you. There's not much mud at Pugneys so we are rather short on waders, sadly. They all seem to prefer elsewhere!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnTobytyke 2/2 on Friday and was alongside the resident Redshank. I thought that was what it was but your pic helps. Didn't stay long 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnTobytyke I'm not good at waders (as @jonnybirder will tell you) Is that the greenshank? The 'same' bird dropped in to #Pugneys on 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fairburnjohng @mn_reeder Now send it over to #Pugneys please! We need a 3 pointer over here 🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillAspin Well, Bill. I must admit that #Brockholes came across very well on #Countryfile. But where were you??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisGPackham @YoloBirder @VisitMalta @ruthpeacey @mooresounds Good luck, Chris and stay safe! I hope they treat you properly.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BillAspin I must admit I've never watched #JeremyKyle. Am I missing much?? 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ceeste45 @BillAspin And keep nagging. They'll just hope you forget and Go Away 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simon_reeve I bet your Missus was thrilled when you told her what this prog would entail 😱🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillAspin @ceeste45 Yeah, but it's a laff, innit! Our #Asda need CCTV at field/beck access if they're to catch them. Bluddy hopeless task🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ceeste45 When I've let Asda know abt trollers in beck they've sent lads down 2retrieve them. Suggest you do similar with direct tweet @Asda<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ceeste45 Asda Wakefield have removed their trolley chains so they're free. Not intending to replace apparently. So they end up at #Pugneys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RSPBDoveStone With no idea of their impact on others and no sense of stewardship, for want of a better word. Very sad. #Litter #Disturbance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FatPaulScholes1 ' Can you tell what it is yet?' As the now disgraced Rolf used to say....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jonny09Jonny @merseabirder @YoloBirder @Sven_Wair Indeed. Perfectly understandable. Though a dead goat might have had the same effect...RIP<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ecology_digest @Natures_Voice Have RSPB officially taken over? Will they open hide(s) or provide map as it's a huge site? Long time coming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonny09Jonny @YoloBirder @Sven_Wair Yes I missed it, whatever IT is. Pending further investigation? The mind boggles 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder @Sven_Wair @Jonny09Jonny I was hoping he'd just given us up for Lent 😳 #Inventabird<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sven_Wair What has happened to Mr Y? He's gone quiet 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCr4today He's doing what I only dream of. Worst include a GG sign advertising cres's and Xma's trees &amp; a local pub &amp; its Hygine rating😠<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Frogspawn in garden pond! Good surprise 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Right. Now do a 'What's landed in my garden' list. I might have a better chance. 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stewchat Know wot u mean. We have a tiny cottage in NYorks on v boring farmland, but I'm patching it to see what's there. More thn expected<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simon_reeve Caught up with Turkey last night. Excellent as p u. Pity such a massive country only warrants a 2 parter. Loved the TG comment!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder @Jonny09Jonny I suspect he'd had a beer or 2 when he got into the challenge 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stewchat 🙄🙄🙄🙄😠<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StansaidAirport And none of those fancy croissant things for in-flight breakfast ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stewchat Right, so you're far more likely to have a Bonxie flying over than we are here at Pugneys! 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Peg?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stewchat @jonnybirder Obviously not #InlandNorth then...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Yes. I think a Super Soaker might be in order...Might save my knuckles - hammering on the window 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder I'm too embarrassed to reply. I'll just say - neighbours' cats. Lots of the buggers. Constant battle 😡🙄😤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tommcnorris You didn't take the train??  🙄🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 @BigSkell Counted 5 chiffies on my walk from our house to Asda #Pugneys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CurlewCountry Pair of #Curlew feeding in a field next to the A64 E of York yesterday morning, unnoticed by most, I suspect!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder I need to keep a close eye on the feeders to see if it's still around #hybrid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Trying 2 remember. I think there was but not as extensive as a HS. The chestnut was more in evidence. It stood out as different<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder 2/2 and not as 'bright' as a regular Tree Sparrow. It definitely wasn't a bog standard male HS but puzzled me somewhat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder I am of the (albeit inexperienced) opinion that the Tree Sparrow in my garden last year was a hybrid. Paler cheek patches 🤔🤔1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@missmagpirate  https://t.co/EooS6L3x5c<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@missmagpirate Yes, do. You can't miss em. But if they fall off they land on their back which is black, and 'disappear'. Cunning devils 😱🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@missmagpirate Mine too. Also of Lily Beetle. Sadly you need to squash the scarlet blighters or they'll wreck the lot 😱😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeoffCarrEco @Wintersett1 Same destruction across the NYMoors today. Shocking. #Burning Heather #Pollution<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nicholson_gary Couldn't have put it better myself. Shocking to see the extent of the smoke drift from numerous fires. Not good at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisnick42 What you call a flying visit. #Whoopers #Pugneys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nicholson_gary @StevieD131 Several fires visible this aft frm Kirkbymoorside. Smoke drifting east for miles. But it's for a good cause, eh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StansaidAirport What an utterly, utterly depressing photo. Especially as they were discussing women's health provision. #Appalling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cleckbirder Hope you have some responses. It does help having specific pointers. Not much in the way of July bird reports 🙄#Lanzarote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cleckbirder  https://t.co/t62MvTXPWk. This might be of use? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnLawArt If you can get your hands on @simonbarneswild article in Sun Times mag this week - it makes very depressing reading #Sheffield<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 2 years ago, I could hear the #Pugneys yaffle from our garden 🤗 #Calderwetlands a bit too far though...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DarraghHudson Picked up 3 or 4 at #Pugneys this morning. My first here but one at Rievaulx NYorks last Friday. #Spring<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder @wakeynats @Wintersett1 Despite the Hotel being named after him. Just not as well known as he should be #LittleOwl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder @wakeynats @Wintersett1 Not good. Wonder what the Hall/hotel has to say about it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RSPB_OldMoor I've heard it called many things, but never that 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder @carly86marie Now, now, As she'll no doubt tell you, what's mine is yours, and what yours is yours ... No, wait.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder Not at all. It's not really like coming over to the #DarkSide! 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroftonBirder Ventured over our way, then? Did you remember your passport? 😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillAspin Light cloud, dry, bit of sun over here in N Yorks. Just saying 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@martinRSPB What a depressing read. As long as every little bird is worth €2 to trappers, it will continue en masse. #OrganisedCrime #Cyprus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MyWakefield 3/3 Most of the heap is fencing (wire n posts) ripped out from the CP Nature Reserve boundary. Prob 30 metre stretch. 😡😡<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnLawArt And again, please? #Pugneys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@la39240105 Read the article. It's local Cypriot poachers who flood a 100 sq mile base to trap the birds. It's money-driven.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MarkAvery It also demonstrates a chronic inability to punctuate, as any 7 year old could tell you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wilgils I hope the owners demand a meeting to explain that decision in the light of the VC #Spurn<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Hudsonweather We used to like your colourful jackets era. Can you 'do a Portillo' and go back to them please? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder God knows who they got to do the graphics. It's sounds a v unpleasant restaurant all round 😱😱#juggedhare<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder This doing the rounds again. Barking. Didn't even realise that GPlover is allegedly edible. 😱 And as for the blackbird-teal 🤔😳🙁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PetsAlertUK @ceeste45 And when they're caught, I trust Her Maj will lock them in the Tower for treason, as they're her swans 😳😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeithSaunders9 @Barnsleybsg @RSPB_OldMoor Not good news.  What will happen to the land, dare I ask?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Waxies reported by a chap called John Wilcox. Gone when I got there🙄🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisnick42 Saw you by #Pugneys entrance. No sign waxies on DDRd by 10am. Not on office estate by CWet either. Any joy? 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@missmagpirate And many of the fabrics - and mugs, teatowels etc  - are drawn by folk with a vivid imagination and no access to real life!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@missmagpirate Indeed!  Get googling, girl!! And when you find out where..... Let me know! 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@missmagpirate A cool £145 from Eton Shirts 😱🙄😳<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@robert_yaxley Walked back from Asda yest across fields. Path starts behind their recycling skips. Puzzled by large pink plastic object 1/2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@missmagpirate It's the way the Red Kite is hanging around over some rather large sheep 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnseeviour @Wintersett1 Which is a worrying situation. It has certain implications. #Spurn<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder What a work of beauty. The binding, box, endpapers themselves are a work of art. You shld be v proud. Good luck with the auction<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Winterwatch Some fantastic bird footage this evening - waders, waxwing &amp; starling. Now could u mention shooting declining woodcock please?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarraghHudson not too local then. I'll look it up on BirdGuides<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PatchBirding Thanks. Emailed the other evening with more details. Will keep an eye out 👍<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 As I thought. I know where it is, but not the name. Thanks 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Right. Now where's Broad Cut?  I'll know it, just not as Broad Cut.....🙄🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WildlifeInWakey Good morning! Give me a wave if you see me at #Pugneys or CWetlands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigSkell 2/2 keep an eye on Twitter and see if there are any within striking distance. I'm still hopeful! 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigSkell No, not for a long time. I saw some in Newcastle in Nov and at Old Moor the year before, but none here. Best thing is to keep 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's what I like about #waxwings. They're not fussy. Sainsburys, Morrisons, Tesco, Costa coffee, taxi ranks... Any car park with berries 🤗<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HughsWaronWaste @waitrose RSPB using #Vegware for cups and cake wrappers. Wrappers cellulose not plastic, cups compostable. So if they can🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirdPieman What a charmer. Assume, stereotypically, that the dog walker was a lady! Then again.... 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MickgCunningham It'll be a housing estate this time next week.  Despair indeed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirdPieman 👍👍👍🤗🤗🤗Best buy him a pie and a pint then!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fileybirder Weather willing, will come and say hello on Wednesday. If there's a YBW, please hang on to it until I get there!! 😳😳🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirdPieman I'll take that as a No then.....😬😬😤😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirdPieman And have they returned it to you?? 😱🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@missmagpirate There's a question. And isn't a crustless quiche a frittata? 🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Mon Dieu. Is there no end to your birding talents? Google agrees with you. I'll get back to her so she can add to her list 🤗🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnymacbirder Hi can you ID these pls? They were keeping a friend company in AbuDhabi. Not a clue!! #AskAnExpert  https://t.co/YxUtq01hGV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahdal_moths Dare I say, as a 60 something, that I suspect many of them have been encouraged to 'get out for the day' by their OHs?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mviser @tommcnorris Well on the basis of that ad, I'd say they've got the wrong woman standing #Michelle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never mind all this exotic dunnock malarkey, have just had a Tree Sparrow in the garden, first one ever #PatchTick #PWC2016 #Pugneys 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatchBirding Happy to say we have at least 25 Grey Partridge here at #Pugneys. The farmer must be doing something right 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@missmagpirate Interesting. I was always outdoors as a kid, though it was a horse thing, not birding. Think there's a PhD to be written here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Agree with you on the discomfort angle. After a certain age, a cafe and nice loo is more of a prerequisite...😳🤔#hedges<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is twitching a predominantly male activity? Discuss...  https://t.co/Nn1oXpi0VF<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DarraghHudson Well it looks OK to me. Was it sufficient? Not an easy task 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarraghHudson Dare I ask how you got on with your tree test?  Answer on DM if you prefer!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaxHellicar1 We were all v well behaved in a nice line on Thurs, until this bloke arrived &amp; set up his scope between us &amp; the bird #plonker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder I don't think I'd have put it any better myself. I always say, keep the F word for when you REALLY need it. And you really did😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Tis always the way. The minute you decide to leave and go home, something interesting is just deciding to land...😳😳🙄😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillAspin Joy in little things, Bill. I was happy to see 2 Song Thrushes in the garden yesterday. #InlandNorth #Pugneys<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@richmowil My problem, as an incompetent, is that I'd see it and assume it was a run of the mill Chiffchaff. How to tell the difference? 🙄🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Sven_Wair @darth_stephanie sure you're happy with that every time? How many UKIP MPs would that have given last election?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@missmagpirate 8 of these, finally jammed jam. #success  https://t.co/c2rsyFAMzd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darth_stephanie @Sven_Wair Yes, I realise that. I was simply commenting that there didn't seem much enthusiasm for a change in the system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarolineLucas @Sven_Wair Did we not have a referendum on this in 2011 where it was rejected by 70% of voters? #PR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right. I'm old. Would someone please explain #PokemonGO to me in 140 characters or fewer? It seems to have passed me by #bewildered<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@missmagpirate Fingers crossed!  I'm currently re-jamming my unjammed strawberry jam 🙄😱 #JamUpYourSleeve #GetItRight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulEele @YoloBirder @missmagpirate  This is one for you, missmag. Get your needles out! Knitted chips too, I hope #KnittedSeagull 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirdPieman Does playing it make your face go all blurry? If so, I'll avoid it, thank you #PokemonGOuk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kevinjholmes @ByrneLuc I did say that I thought 'extermination' was hyperbole. Sometimes words are misused, you know. I didn't write it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrkjduffy Well I might as well get something extra from my #RHS membership. Glad to help. Just keep posting your rig bird photos!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wilgils One would hope that public opinion would hold sway. Why is YWT so desperate to build on that site when others are available? #Spurn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevinjholmes @ChrisGPackham I will grant you that extermination is hyperbole. But many people find the numbers of hare shot to be shocking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrkjduffy AmElanchier, sorry. Not AmAlanchier #getitright<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisGPackham Ooh, I see you're being an 'extremist' again today.  Keep it up, if this is what extremism is. #BanDrivenGrouseShooting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevinjholmes @ChrisGPackham There have been numerous photos of piles of dead hares, pickup trucks filled with them, posted on Twitter.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@missmagpirate Sounds like a character from a 1950s children's book! Very Swallows and Amazons or Pippi Longstocking. I can't remember mine!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mockeree @robert_yaxley The way things are, nothing would surprise me at the moment 🙄😳😱🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDearneValley @ChrisGPackham @MarkAvery Interesting to see CGP described as an 'extremist' and driven grouse shooting as 'sustainable'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrkjduffy There's often dried up dropped fruit around tree base. That'll be better than nothing. Shows if there's seeds or stones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrkjduffy And if I get nowhere with RHS I'll ask at Rodgers in Pickering #mystery<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrkjduffy When you go again, get photos of the whole tree, leaves and fruit close up instead of the bird! Might be a better starting place<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrkjduffy OK. Will send the photos off to to #RHS, being a member. What colour is the blossom? Will let you know if I get a result!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrkjduffy Is it in your garden? Can you get a better pic of the fruit? Looks cherry-like apart from the base of the fruit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wintersett1 That's the one - thank you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BirdTrack 2/2 Visits pg &amp; which I can't delete. All others hv uploaded as normal. Advice? Also how to edit an uploaded visit to add a bird?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirdTrack Have been using Global app while in Poland &amp; Greece. However, have 2 records which have uploaded but which remain on the 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NivenJ1 So in effect, he's saying that he wished he'd had first thoughts, never mind second. So do a lot of people #Brexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DarraghHudson You must be the most UK-travelled student I've come across. With the most patient/ helpful Mum 🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarraghHudson Where are you? Not #Pugneys, that's for sure!!😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ARgNUT86 A tad patronising, don't you think?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Back home after 4 weeks away. Don't know what's a bigger tangly mess - the country or my garden. At least I can sort my garden 😳😓 #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jon_trickett Had Corbyn swallowed his hubris and stood on a platform with Cameron et al pre-Ref, the current mess might not be happening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sconebirding The problem being that one side would call on its supporters not to vote, so ensuring  less than 75% turnout. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnthonyBentley7 @YoloBirder Why can't the RSPB get stuck in here then? Isn't it their main remit? #Terns<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonny09Jonny Sat on balcony here in Greece the other evening and heard frogs. Which was odd, until we realised it was a nightjar. Magic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sconebirding Just leave your desk, go outside and do some birding. Best de-stresser on the planet. #Brexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SimonCrockford @YoloBirder I'm 62, apparently, or so I'm lead to believe, though the head says otherwise.  Is that an honest answer?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seems my comment about Samantha booking Pickfords was prescient. Who now? #CamoronResigns<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notsotweets @YoloBirder To put that in context, the EU spends that every year to relocate to Strasbourg for 4 days a month #waste<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder Hang on. Some of your faithful followers are Old People. Don't paint us all with the same brush.😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Am wondering if Samantha is already on the phone to Pickfords.  #Brexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Sven_Wair Sadly, #Wakefield Council hasn't got the message. Millions of daisies got a haircut this morning courtesy of the mower man 😬<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Dr_XYZ @TheBMA @Jeremy_Hunt As a teacher, I've said for years that we shld be training far more Drs than we are. More med schools needed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KarmenuVella You must be aware that Turtle Doves in UK are 97% down on 1970 figures. For every 100 we should have, we have 3. Shocking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@damian_money I agree totally. I've tweeted b4 that we need to convert the Maltese et al to clay pigeon shooting. The only things to shoot!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The good news. First ever Lesser Redpoll in the garden #pwc2016 The bad news. Mink spotted on beck #Pugneys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@damian_money The diff being that pheasants are raised specifically for shooting. TDoves are shot on their way to breed, which is madness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisGPackham I can understand people killing birds for food. I can't understand shooting breeding birds for sport #Malta #wheredovesdie<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Sven_Wair @BBCNews I concur completely. One side says something and it's immediately ridiculed by the other as untrue. Who to believe?? 😬🤔😡<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wilgils The scary words are 'projected visitor numbers' &amp; 'improved visitor offer'. Let's just turn #Spurn into Skegness2 &amp; be done with it<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DarraghHudson  Trek! As in Star Trek<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 I'll be out tomorrow after that SEO.  Police building area first? The siskins seem small beer by comparison!! #pugneys<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnTobytyke Hi. Can you give me directions to Edderthorpe from OM or its grid ref pls? Thanks :-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haggewoods Didn't realise where the woodland is. Pass nearby when on Riccall to York cycle path. Will look out for it next visit :-)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Toooo late! I'm in Scotland for NY so it won't make a 2015 list. Maybe Sunday I'll see it if it hangs about :-D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulNCov @YoloBirder I think we're level pegging with the hat-nest box and bird-boot. To think that someone thought them a good idea :-D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robert_yaxley Ring NHS Direct &amp; they may tell you. They told me what jabs I needed for Mali, not Bali. Good job I got a second opinion :-D<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Very impressive goldfinch photos indeed. Wish mine turned out half as well! No need for #Pugneys to be closed today? #Wellies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wintersett1 That's not good! You need a cuppa after a brisk walk or cycling to Anglers. Cheap and cheerful, friendly service. #SaveTheCafe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulNCov @YoloBirder Suggest you a) pass it to Charity shop or b) wrap it as a secret Santa Xmas 2016. Or bite the bullet and put it up ;-)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 That's because they're all in my garden. Seriously, there are also Dunnock in the hedge by the farm buildings #TheMissing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 But did you find any chaffinch?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MickgCunningham 'Not a sniff of owt with 'em'. How very #Inlandbirdingissh*t as @BirdPieman once said :-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MickgCunningham Don't park in #Pugneys. Go over r'bt, turn in at pub and park on yellow pavement opp offices. Then risk life crossing road!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cocoandghosty3h Much as I agree, it's Tax Avoidance by the wealthy, which is legal. Gov's over the years have failed to close loopholes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCLookNorth @Hudsonweather Bring back the colourful jackets! And a tie. And stop saying 'goodbye from myself'. It's 'from ME' #GETITRIGHT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fisermanian He's obviously doing the Grand Tour de Pugneys. Reserve lake next #GND<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robert_yaxley Nil desperandum. You have my empathy. House moves (or fails) are serious stress but things work out in the end. #secateurs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder Yeah, cos some of us refuse to use slug pellets as they don't mix well with garden birds :-( #frosty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@littlebrownjob @RSPB_OldMoor Me too. That waxwing has brought happiness to a lot of people! It didn't seem bothered by the attention :-)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CleyBirds @Zoothera_nixoni Are these doggers or Peter Kaye comedy doggers ie dog walkers? The difference is important.... ;-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wintersett1 Aargh! Called in just now on way back from work. Could barely see 10 yards - foggy. No sign of #GND  :-( #muddy #tomorrow??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25  Love the #Pugneys partridges. I counted 20 in 2 coveys the other day. Will keep an eye out for the missing chaffinch :-)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Ey oop! You've been v quiet since that greenpecker. Can you whistle summat up to #Pugneys? It's a bit soul destroying on patch!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robert_yaxley Checked out snapdragons. Linaria marrocana sounds far more impressive #botany<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdHutchings Dare I ask if you are the Ed H who wrote the eminently sensible letter to a national newspaper re gull culling? #dirtystreets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatchBirding Too embarrassed to fill in this month's form. Dire! #PWC2015<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robert_yaxley Was puzzled as they were tiny and in a wildflower meadow. Thought they were a different 'variety' so to speak #numpty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robert_yaxley If in doubt, ask an expert. Can you name me this little wild flower please? #botanist  http://t.co/taC34EVwi9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spent 5 hours at #RHSWisley, one of UK's top gardens. Butterfly count 2. WTF?? Am I missing something? (Apart from butterflies) #puzzled<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RSPB_OldMoor Amazing to think that Old Moor has gone from colliery wasteland to haven for bitterns little and large. Hope for us all :-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robert_yaxley Currently on M1 where verges are full of flowers. Is anyone surveying them? #C21meadows<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VagueBirdAlert Possible gull sighted Leeds #Waitrose.  Unidentified #unidentifiable  http://t.co/tZ0KJIlMYD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hudsonweather Right. Let's get this sorted. To sign off, it's 'from Harry and ME' not I or myself. I shout at the TV every time! #MeMeMe xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Yaffle audible from garden :-)) #Pugneys 98 and counting!! #PWC15 #deepjoy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder  Am on 97 sp on #PWC15 .  Just 3 to go for the magic 100. Keep seeing new stuff off-patch! #frustration #pugneys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Will check on your artwork map to see if it's where I think it is #abouttimetoo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Pleased to hear there is activity out there! Country Park or wetlands? Last one I heard was at Wentworth Castle #yaffle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robert_yaxley #Dovestep2 badges arrived in this morning's post. Thank you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder I'd have been happy this winter with a boring normal waxwing ;-) #pugneys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TY very much #WakefieldCouncil for scalping the verges #bees #clover #StopIt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder  @robert_yaxley Mr Birder, you'll just have to buy one like the rest of us. No favouritism, please ;-) #Dovestep2 #badge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Probably on its way to #pugneys  ;-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder All 4 young kestrels now out and about. Waiting patiently on barn roof for food, being rather puzzled by woodpigs #fingersX :-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robert_yaxley @jonny09jonny Or even 'proof read their articles' #drivesmenuts #pedant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robert_yaxley @Jonny09Jonny Always amazes me that 'professional' journos don't bother to proff reed there articals.  Bustards in text. :-(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder 4 young kestrels + adults this eve. 3 away but this chap unwilling to leave ledge below nest #uknowwhere  http://t.co/h7s4tz4NqX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Red kite wheeling over Chapeltown Road  Leeds. Not what I was expecting to see!! #WelcometoLeeds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder That's what I thought, but @YoloBirder assured me that by buying one, I'm guaranteed mega success. That's if I can believe him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Hang on, how come yours has arrived?? I've only bought one with the guarantee that wearing it means I overtake you in #PWC2015<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder That barn owl. Couldn't you have brought it back to #pugneys ;-) ? #pwc15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Know what ya mean. Same old same old. Not exactly a walk of discovery! Depressing reading other #PWC tweets:-( Keep smiling :-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder OH heard cuckoo from garden other day - logged it on #BirdTrack. Will listen out again. Have you found that Savvi's yet?? ;-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonny09Jonny Maybe you should be spending some of the money teaching the Maltese how to shoot clays for fun instead #justathought<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder Google 'Mitchell Webb Homeopathy A&amp;E' and watch on YouTube. Utterly brilliant. #barking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robert_yaxley Re Briza Maxima grass. Just don't plant any in your garden. You'll be pulling it up by the barrow load in 2 yrs time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 ID on this please in the garden this tea time? #pugneys nearly  http://t.co/AHph20pk7l<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder Rather like Napoleon's instruction to Josephine on his return from battle. Ne te lave pas- don't get washed.  #ooer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder Assuming we're buying the t shirts for ourselves of course! #ooer #trust #wrenhenvenn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_BBRC @jonnybirder Good job as I listed it for #pugneys #PWC15 ! ;-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder Now. What to do about oldies like me who don't do Tshirts. Any chance of button badges? Even Mr Packham might wear 1 discretely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder You could always take a stall at CLA Gamefair at Harewood House in August? Might make for some interesting publicity.  ;-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoloBirder Think we need to see you modelling one #wrendiagram #hendiagram<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder and here's one with its head above water for a change. Curlew sandpiper?? #not as vague  http://t.co/evvJ3XeX59<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Here's your starter for 10. Name that wader.... SE Sicily last week.  http://t.co/1ZBED81cPC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder very few previous sightings from here to go on. Next to nothing on web. V frustrating!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Struggling to ID subalpine warbler here. Flitting in lemon tree in deserted orchard. No chance of photo :-( so #vague!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Tell Arctic Tern to hang on til I get home tomorrow. Still being a rare birder in Sicily. ie not many of us about! #BirdTrack<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VagueBirdAlert Probably this Great Big Warbler #somewhereinSpain  http://t.co/E4NJC6Y95N<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Is whinchat still @ WHouse? Might try for better photo later. 4 whims interesting. One addition or a different group? #pugneys<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Yes, the pale one. No pics as had called in on way home from volunteering. Followed it to slipway and assumed it was a grey wag<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Saw this by the slipway; being #gormless thought it was grey wag. Tell me it's s'thing more interesting, pls! #pugneys #PWC15<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RSPB_OldMoor Y'hammer hang round cows as the animals kick up insects etc which r rich pickings. Often see several round  Koniks at B'toft.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirdGuides Buzzards are known as Tourist Eagles in some parts of the country. Anything to keep the visitors happy :-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Pleased there's one around. Saw a pair this time last year over Castle pond so you never know :-) #Pugneys #PWC2015<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Well you get a big blue heron and a Hudwit on your awaydays. I'm still chasing such things as curlew sands! ;-) #lifelist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Defected to Blacktoft today. Mont harrier, curlew sand, greenshank, ruff amid th'avocets. Worth getting blown about #BirdTrack<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder If it had had an ounce of decency it would've turned up a few days ago so you'd have seen it on way back from Scillies ;-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonny09Jonny Well done gentlemen. Quel succes! Onwards and upwards.  BTW, French for blisters is les cloques. Have donated, my privilege.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder According to Bird Guides, there were 3 on Scilly Tues. Or cld have been put up in France by 3 scary blokes on bikes ;-) #NoFear<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Amazing!! Now tell me that you scoped them from #Pugneys ;-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder With your luck they'll be sitting around waiting for you #Pugneys #NoFear<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder What does that take #Pugneys species count to this year? Well done! #PWC2015<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Thanks for the shout. Got a do-able record shot then lined up a better one later and camera died. Typical! #pugneys #PWC15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder got them I hope. Where you now? #Pugneys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder setting off in 5 mins. Do ya know if they're still there?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Hope the weather's suiting you #rain #wind #cold #Pugneys #notMexico<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonny09Jonny Hi. Your French homework has been sent to you and your co-steppers. No excuses for not doing it. Your dog will not eat it :-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisnick42 Will have to get up earlier! Main lake I presume? Thanks for the tip #Pugneys #PWC2015<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonite_dave Smew seems to commute btw river, Cawoods, main and reserve.  Still struggling to find the sandies, to my disgust :-(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarraghHudson Look at  http://t.co/M2Q6fmpprz for a start. Also look at map of Skye on #BirdTrack to see where sightings are clustered :-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First blackcap of the year #Pugneys #spring #PWC2015 tick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some seriously competitive birding on #thearchers again this eve. Is Ambridge on #PWC15? I think we should be told :-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisnick42 @jonnybirder Good job too.  There'd be Hell to pay if a mega flitted through while himself was on his #MexicanPatch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Barnsleybsg @RSPB_OldMoor Please send the avocets over to #Pugneys.  It's not that far! #PWC2015<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Where are you picking up the grey wag (as per #BirdTrack ) pls? I found c70 pied wags on Fri aft by main lake but grey??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Lovely smew pics from #Pugneys.  He was on reserve lake yest aft hiding among the goldeneyes.  Gorgeous little chap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Thank you! That's another tick for this year, even tho not on patch. I see goldplvr in fields nr house but grey are new to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatchBirding What a shame @jonnybirder is off patch at the moment.... #PWC15 #MexicanPatch ;-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BernardEmson @RSPB_OldMoor @Barnsleybsg silent birds but local cockerel started up instead.  Coincidence?? #Eclipse2015<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder And today's offering is ...? Certainly more colourful than the last one :-) #MexicanPatch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonny09Jonny @robert_yaxley I'll DM my email address which might make things easier (and longer) #AllezLesAnglais #DoveStep2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robert_yaxley @Jonny09Jonny I taught French for 35 yrs. where shall I start?? Serious or silly? #AllezLesAnglais!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Rather underwhelming compared to yesterday's ridiculously named Plain Chachalaca (looked up spelling as you do) #MexicanPatch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonny09Jonny Only seen TDs twice. Pair at Blacktoft RSPB and pair in Croatia. Beautiful birds. V much worth your efforts :-) #DoveStep2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonny09Jonny Have been following your progress from afar.  Will you be selling the badges by post? Or will @jonnybirder get me one?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pair of kestrels visiting last year's nest hole at farm this aft #Pugneys #BirdTrack #spring<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Good job it quietens down. Might leave you some time for drinking ;-) #MexicanPatch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Yay. I saw one of them in Florida.  Hope you're having fun identifying them all. #MexicanPatch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Can you persuade #PWC15 to let you have a Mexico patch? You might win that one too ;-)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Found it on map. Not where I thought! Will go and investigate. A new and unknown part of #pugneys patch #PWC2015 Thanks :-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Hope you see the range of birds we did in Florida last March. Still trying to identify some- even reserve rangers were clueless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Need to refer to your #pugneys hand-drawn map.  Only stuff on Island was one redshank and gulls. Snipe in reed bed far side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder 2 weeks to catch you up?? 2 months more like! #PWC2015 Where is Wadhouse Marsh? New one to me. Will keep ears open for chiffs!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder As ever, right place, right time. Always makes me wonder what goes past when you're not looking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Well done. Saw buckets of Egyptns in Norfolk last week. Not a pretty bird, sadly! #pugneys. Did ya sent it past my window?? :-)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder @PatchBirding @Forestoptics Congratulations! Now find us something mega this year, please #Pugneys #PWC15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Hmm. North Norfolk Coast next w/end.  Lots of ticks but #notmypatch! Will have to do 2 visits a day to #Pugneys to keep up...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Jolly good! Saw several yesterday, but in the Lakes, along with treecreeper #notmypatch:-(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Sorry, but don't think it'll qualify as Birdguides Photo of the Week ;-(  Good record though! #Pugneys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder went back and found him in field by farm feeding near manure heap. Pinkfoot I think? #Pugneys  http://t.co/58kLjZkTH9<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 No wonder top 7 places for passing your driving test are in the Scottish Highlands :-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Phil_Lowe_  one of my favourite photos of all time, I think! Hope the penguins appreciate them, especially the paperback cover orange one!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder I gather it's worth buying a certain birding mag this month?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Starling murmuration this evening. Best free show in Wakey #Pugneys  http://t.co/BFprH3w1ZS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 parrot had quite an audience this morning when I saw him. Pleased he's survived the weather, crows and jays #Pugneysparrot<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Phil_Lowe_ @QualityLindsey  Don't push your luck! Trust you returned with an impressive orchid in a pot .....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Phil_Lowe_ what a cutie! (The yellowhammer, that is)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Oh Misery! Out for the day. Watched the starling murmuration #Pugneys as we got back. Then read the bittern tweet. Tomorrow....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Morrissey should've done a bit of research first- Minkewhale, puffin, fermented shark, horse all on menus. They'll eat owt!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greenhairstreak hi. Can you ID the 2 chiffchaff please? I'm no expert so need all the help I can get #EnthusiasticIncompetent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dgibsonbird OOH! 1.97miles from back bedroom window to Cathedral as peregrine flies. Don't think my scope's up to it though! #NiceOne<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 Aha. I saw it last yr in same place, on various occasions but haven't done so this year. Will keep eyes open for it. Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Phil_Lowe_ Rather cryptic, that Phil :-/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25  Hi. Re your Birdtrack list today, where was the goldcrest please? Happy to see the parrot (nul points) seems to be thriving!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder 84!!! What have I missed that isn't a gull I can't recognise?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Almost embarrassed to tell you (though not bad for me!) 57 ssp seen, 64 points. Go on, tell me yours! #MakeMeCry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RSPB_OldMoor that robin outside Family Hide again. Takes posing to a new level.  #whatacutie  http://t.co/KZkchySmLo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RSPB_OldMoor not forgetting buckets of bullfinches. Lovely to see all the yellowhammer and reed bunting. Don't know what you're feeding em!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RSPB_OldMoor never seen as many little birds in 1 place as TSFarm. Yhammer Reedbunts Redwing Greenf Goldf Treesp SThrush Chaff Wren Robin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarraghHudson Hi! Think you'll need big snow for school to close! Are you following @jonnybirder ? He might help with finding LSwoodpeckers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisnick42 All help gratefully received! #enthusiastic incompetent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Phil_Lowe_ Saw WRail at Fairburn while ago. In the reeds by the car park. Sound today like a pig squealing, really loud. Quite freaky!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Loud squealy noises from 'interesting pond' late this aft. Water rail? Or wishful thinking?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder @chrisnick42 must've just missed you. Got him at last :-) thanks Chris!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks to birder for pointing out drake smew main lake #Pugneys 16:30. Went back round for good view &amp; cr@p photo. One more tick #PWC2015<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Will have to catch the bugger first!  Red kites feed in friends back garden in Stokenchurch so might be easier...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder We used to get one regularly in the garden ground feeding with housesparrows. Not seen one for a while but GSW now a regular<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Nice one! Whereabouts? Currently in Oxfordshire, 48+red kites yesterday plus one Cettis Warbler #notonmypatch:-(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Phil_Lowe_  per IB? I don't get it :-( ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenMangan I bet his mother is thrilled :-0 #whywouldyou?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Phil_Lowe_ #Fairburn Ings today. Kingfisher,tree sparrow,little egret, female smew, willowtit, shelduck,oystercatcher all 2015 ticks. :-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarrenStarkey Thanks. Confirmed it was what I thought it was. Seen from BD Hide; smew at far side near road. :-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarrenStarkey @Phil_Lowe_ A good tick for me. Pity it's not on my patch! #PWC15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YorksWildlife @YWTPottericCarr Hi. What time is good for the starling murmuration #megaflocks please?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fairburnings have just batted 7, yes 7, magpies off my bird feeders.  Sigh. Will have to drive over to #fairburnings for a different view<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder what've you done now? Not the lovely LEvans surely?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhemingway25 I've been chasing it for days now. Every time I get there it's flitted. Cawood, river, main lake... I'll get it eventually!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Have found an excellent video by #BTO explaining the difference. Going for Marsh tit with added weight of habitat. Not easy!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder how to distinguish btw marsh tit and willowtit? 2 at Harlow Carr woodland on bird feeders, mid morning, both silent #notaclue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sconebirding Now that's what I call showing off. I'm luck when I get the very occasional GSWoodpecker.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Phil_Lowe_ thanks. Your local patch?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Phil_Lowe_ where did you go to find the mandarin? V pretty chap!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GreenpeaceUK next stop UK. Then ban styrofoam packaging and replace with plant based foam chips which dissolve on the compost heap<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder what time is good for smew? Think I go too early<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder tail-less looks v sorry. Is peregrine likely to be cathedral bird? Still smew chasing/missing. Work+dentist 2day so no patch:-(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder @PatchBirding @birdguides_news Excellent article re #pugneys Mr B. Tho' now I know what I've missed, it's not a happy read!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder hi again. Unsure of PWC procedure. Should I have done anything bar sign up as yet?? Am keeping a record of my pitiful sightings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder that'll be LittleOwl on my profile pic from the farm I think? Not seen it this year last sighting was on rugby floodlight Dec.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The_Orcadian pics of ferry v scary. Sick bags at the ready!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder brave man to be out this aft #Pugneys. Went up to ScoutDike Res and could barely open car door against the wind. Ridiculous!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder some interesting studies being done on birds feeding at SW ingesting high levels of hormones and depressants. Not good!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Chiffchaff still around?  At least I'll know I'm not hearing things if I do hear them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder gone by the time I got there at 10:50 :-(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Phil_Lowe_ if you turn up one tea time, wear the hat so we can recognise you #Pugneys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Phil_Lowe_ hi Pugneys is my patch (I'm an enthusiastic incompetent) Usually people there at tea time + scopes around car park who'll help<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sconebirding a famous bird watcher but one who has time to reply to my 'odd' questions on #BTO. Scary looking bird though! #fame at last<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder hi email for Pugneys bird report is hbmilburn@gmail.com No smew this aft on river/lake sadly.  Thanks<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Many thanks to @jonnybirder for his gull tutorial #Pugneys this aft.  5 to add to #birdtrack and #PWC15 :-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OssettNST Good luck for tomorrow! Will yr first move be to redecorate Heads Office? ;-) Trust Parto hasn't been ringing you with tips...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Thanks.  Usually find that birders are happy to help the ignorant if asked nicely! Wish I'd started proper birding years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnybirder Hi need Casp pointing out as I know nothing re gulls. Live nearby. When good time/day 2 ask 4 help? Advice gratefully received<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LeeEvansBirding Makes my @BirdTrack 122 species seem rather sad!  Must do better in 2015. Would be interested to see your lists for ideas.<|endoftext|>
