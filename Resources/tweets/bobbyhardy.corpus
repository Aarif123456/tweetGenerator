<|startoftext|>(BULLY).  Black women are not DOGS, NASTY, ANGRY OR MONSTERS.  I was created by a black woman, and I have a black daughter.  Biden is running for president not Kamala. The federal government sued the Trump family and won.  Until you have lived as a minority in a country where<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>his father put out the word at all of their buildings not to rent to BLACK FOLK.  However I tried to give him a chance, against the wishes of my family, because I believe in forgiveness.  He blew it.

<|startoftext|>A friend sent me this on messenger.

<|startoftext|>However, I was tired of the negativity, and here we are.   We need to bring down the heat in America.  Trump said #KamalaHarris the socialist "will never be our first woman president, because we're not gonna take it.  Especially from a female." Mouth drop!  Since this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The way #DonaldJTrump speaks about #women is amazing to me.  Christians don't act like that, at least the one's I know .  I understand why the #WhiteEvangelicals are leaving him in groves "We gave him a chance and he failed".  I feel the same way, because I gave him a chance.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Loan $6500 and the finance charges were $7500.  These banks prey on #Seniors and @OneMain is no different. Life insurance on the loan was paid in full to One Main. I dispute and challenge the finance charges.  The attitude I received was unbelievable and disrespectful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's absolutely #hateful, #deceitful and down right wrong for institutions to take advantage of #seniorcitizens.  My mom took out a loan, that I didn't know about for $6500 in 2014 and the loan had an #APR of 35.99%.  Which means that the #finance charges were more than the loan.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BlessThisMessTV looks like it's going to be a funny #series with @daxshepard @lakebell and @PamGrier on @DisneyABCTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NOTE: called #FOX at 3:50PM and after the 40 minute wait I left my number to get a call back &amp; noticed after a meeting that they did not call back at 6:14pm however I was not available.  Just sad that all @Foxrentcar is concerned about is renting cars not #customer concerns<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Learn to take the heat!  H=Hear the customer out! E=Empathize A=Apologize and T=Take responsibility.  Simple, but the best approach to customer service #carrental #Fox #lax #airport #customerservice #Airlines @Priceline is the company that I got the @foxrentcar through.  https://t.co/De7DKfKoAv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and @foxrentcar is the hardest company to reach on the phone.  After waiting for an hour of listening to theres more than 10 callers ahead of you for 40 minutes is unacceptable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>clearly smell the tobacco when taking a long road trip with the windows closed.  The guy @fox says you should have bought it back, however I didn't smell it until I was on my way to San Bernardino and I didn't want to wait in line for another hour.  Such poor customer service.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>up the car again.  Thirdly the car was suppose to be a non #smoking car however I get on the freeway headed to my destination and I started smelling the #Tobacco and I'm a non smoker.  I mention it when turning in the car that it should not be listed as non smoking when you can<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Since @foxrentcar won't settle this privately I figure we would do this publicly.  First I rented a car from @foxrentcar in November and had to wait an hour in line to pick up the car.  Secondly I rented a car on March 10th from @foxrentcar and had to wait in line an hour to pick<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheView again put a bad taste in my mouth watching the disrespect and inconsiderate Meghan. @ABCNetwork I thought that this was an opinion show?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How can @TheView allow that snotty, disrespectful panelists Meghan be so one sided. @JoyVBehar should be allowed her opinion without rushing to a commercial because Meghan doesn't want to talk about a topic.  Joy deserves better than that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So today @VeteransHealth @VAVetBenefits @DeptVetAffairs they told me that I won't have #cataract #surgery until #Feburary 9 and I have cataracts in both eyes, which means I can't see, and have no help and a 10% connection at ($133.18) month from the @VAVetBenefits #FAIL #SAD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So basically the @Arkansasgov stole our family home while my dad was a WARD of the state and a #Vietnam #veteran #Schizophrenia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The state of #Arkansas said they couldn't reach a family member before they #stole his #property, and they gave the family nothing.  The house had been owned since 1967. I faught, but they won @BillClinton was Governor, I don't remember the land commission officer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My dad became a ward or the state of #Arkansas in 1986 for #Schizophrenia died 6 years later. @DeptVetAffairs called a week later to say dad was in the morgue.  After getting papers in order I found out the family home was auctioned off<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MeghanMcCain will defend this administration because their #Republicans, forget they have no integrity.  @ananavarro rock's. Why defend foolishness @TheView<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will be watching on @ABCNetwork  #Westcoast @jimmykimmel you da man!  Thank you for all you do.  Let @judgeroymooreAL have it.  He's really a poor excuse of a christian.

<|startoftext|>#45 is giving an #Oscar deserving #performance HE's playing #crazy &amp; #insane so that he gets off easy, now that @BobSMueller is closing in. He's very #sane &amp; knows how to play the game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You learn a lot at VA GROUPS.  It's eye opening listening to other #veterans tell their story.  It's amazing the difference made between veterans.  Conditions and percentage rates discussed.  You really learn a lot. #discrimination is alive a well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/RxnMWJ8udW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VAVetBenefits I have spoken to other @veterans with the same condition receiving a higher percentage, with less complications.  They are not having #cataractsurgery I am. Sad to be treated unfairly because President Obama got involved.  when I said to the VET I get 10% even they were shocked.  https://t.co/Yp4ehCKB07<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just a couple of photos of what I have been dealing with.  #weekcapillaries I wake up in the morning with this.  Just a few of the side effects.  I'm 56 and didn't do for mefdical help at the VA until I was 52 and they are slow to help.  Noone should have to deal with pain daily  https://t.co/64MqIfsrWT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I remember my #psychologist said I should be happy for the 10%, because normally they deny #veterans the first time, so I should be happy.  WAHT? IT'S A KNOWN FACT. How are you going to compare a #physical injury to a #Mental injury  I requested a new doctor.  @VAVetBenefits<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is how #America treats #Veterans downright shameful  https://t.co/aNWvzdmYzu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>however, they were not pleased that I contacted president Obama, so I was only given 10% as punishment.  I have had a ruff 4years. with sensitivity to light, draining, pain, migraines and swollen eyes very noticeable, however @VAVetBenefits treated me unfairly #sad #FAIL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm literally looking through frosted glass due to #chronicuveitis &amp; #macularedema given 10% connection in 2016,I will have cataract surgery on December 1 come to find out the eye doctor the VA sent me too told them that the degeneration of my eyesight was severe. @VAVetBenefits<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MYPEOPLE the red states!  What?  @TheView @ABCNetwork Why take up for this #lunatic in the @WhiteHouse @MeghanMcCain needs to learn to take the HEAT.  Hear others out, #Empathize, #Apologize and Take responsible.  @joybauer stand strong<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My dad never received the benefits he deserved from @VAVetBenefits and he died at 49 years old, and I will not let that happen to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's appalling @DeptVetAffairs @VAVetBenefits will not give you the percentage you deserve unless there's an #Attorney fighting for you.  #Shameful. #greed &amp; approving friends claims and leaving others in the cold<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#cataract surgery due to the inflammation and edema that @VAVetBenefits says I only deserved 10% for, now at 56 I need #cataract surgery #sad @DeptVetAffairs #mistreatment of #power, all because I ask President @BarackObama, vowing to help me with no help at all  https://t.co/hidG31CuSG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So disappointed in @VAVetBenefits &amp; @DeptVetAffairs . Because I wrote @BarackObama regarding my situation, I only received 10% in 2016 for #Chronicuveitis &amp; #macularedema today I can't see and was told yesterday at the #Va that I will have #cataract surgery on Dec 1st. #sad<|endoftext|>
