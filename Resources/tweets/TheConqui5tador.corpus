<|startoftext|>@stoolpresidente @TMZ @Vindog56 RIP @TMZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TexasGOP @foxandfriends @AllenWest Lol absolute cowards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden  https://t.co/vIZL6HneOC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaelmalice Even if a monopoly were to exist in the market that doesn’t really mean it’s a bad thing. @ThomasEWoods wrote a really good piece about that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lukewearechange  https://t.co/HNmdPRnaUY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AP4Liberty Is this their way of telling the world they exterminated all the Uighurs?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luck_russell @michaelmalice He made that face a few times lastnight lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NonEssentialCC @michaelmalice I was a libertarian before but the more I listen the closer to “anarchistic” I become.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NonEssentialCC @michaelmalice I agree 100%, too many people don’t take personal responsibility for their own safety seriously and it’s partly resulted in the police state. Alex was arguing on IRL that blaming the cops was a cop out and it’s not at all. Individuals are solely responsible for their own actions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaelmalice Why blame the cops? The law just or unjust 100% relies on someone there to enforce it. Not the other way around.... with out the cops it wouldn’t matter what the law says.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Timcast @realDonaldTrump @officialmcafee as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AP4Liberty I don’t think it would happen either. But, I am concerned where it goes from here. I’m not sure how we can figure out a way to bridge the schism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AP4Liberty A GOP TX rep will introduce a Bill to look into seceding. Half the states sued the other half. Half the states said the other are guilty of sedition. There’s 75million people who feel like the courts at all levels and government are ignoring their calls about impropriety<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AP4Liberty “This decision will have far reaching ramifications for the future of our constitutional republic. Perhaps law-abiding states should bond together and form a Union of states that will abide by the constitution.” Doesn’t explicitly state secession but seems to be hinting at it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AP4Liberty What are your thoughts on the Texas GOP statement?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaelmalice Whether it’s “policing”, roads or national defense. We are conditioned to view these systems in terms of a government monopoly. But, just because we can’t imagine how it would work without the government doesn’t mean it won’t. The market will provide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaelmalice Never thought I’d see Alex defending cops... that was weird.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beinlibertarian  https://t.co/nYycf7VcW9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TexasGOP @AllenWest @TXlege @Lukewearechange strong words near the end. Would love to hear your thoughts on IRL tonight<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AP4Liberty @tonylovasco @justinamash What was Norquists alternative?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AP4Liberty @tonylovasco @justinamash It’s not the best way to govern for sure but in our current system it seems the most pragmatic. You likely won’t get enough house members to go along with the spending cuts I’d like to see. So the options are ear mark or let the budget pass with a giant slush fund for the pres.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AP4Liberty @tonylovasco @justinamash I don’t think a pass is required. The Constitution says the Legislature is in charge of the purse which is a check on the executive. They should eat mark every single dime. Even if the budget will pass... cause you can still vote no on the final budget :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tonylovasco @AP4Liberty @justinamash The earmarks were just so they could designate where each penny was going correct? If the budget was going to pass regardless at least earmark the funds so the President can’t just spend it wherever they wanted was the thought process ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AP4Liberty So that’s why my Great Grandma left Denmark.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@alijillTN @QuestFanning Watching the libertarian civil war unfold during this election opened my eyes a lot to the schism between big (L) libertarians and small (l). I would imagine most big (L) like Amash more while small (l) prefer Massie. I'm with you and prefer Massie over Amash.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alijillTN @QuestFanning Well to be fair one suffers from TDS and the other still maintains objectivity. Party affiliation is of little consequence...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamCrigler "Official Sources". Literally the only official sources are the Electoral College or *possibly* house delegations.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TulsiGabbard had the second best performance. I think she did serious damage to @KamalaHarris. The fact @KamalaHarris avoided eye contact and did not engage her the rest of the night was telling. The rest of the field had a neutral night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewYang had the best night. He avoided a lot of the language that will help him to build a winning coalition in the general. @TulsiGabbard does herself a disservice using that language ie. saying Trump supports Al Qaeda.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chasebrice7 thanks for making the playoffs possible again! You the man! Chase “4th &amp; 6” Brice will live forever in Clemson lore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkPacker Murray for Heisman. Oklahoman would have 3 losses or more if not for him alone. He’s meant more to his teams success than Tua. Especially when you factor in the OKs defense.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MarkPacker @ESPN_ReceDavis @JonVilma51 @4pm @ESPNUonSiriusXM I got ya in the computer. Totally agree with the bowl locations. As a Clemson fan that ticked me off and our travel isn’t as bad as Georgia’s or Oklahoma’s. That was non sense. Some minor changes would improve the CFP system immensely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkPacker @ESPN_ReceDavis @JonVilma51 @4pm @ESPNUonSiriusXM Can you wait until 3:33 CST? I’d be very appreciative lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkPacker @ESPNUonSiriusXM 30 days of salt. I’m ready for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theACC you need to call down to the refs in this Clemson/SC game before someone gets hurt. Ridiculous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkPacker live look at the playoff committee right now lol. #chaos  https://t.co/A5Ma4RmqVn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClemsonFB where can I get a replica purple jersey?! I need this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkPacker Let’s Go?! Don’t have a dog in the fight but I love good games!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“It will work itself out,” @MarkPacker ain’t that the truth. This Auburn game is nuts?! And our Clemson offense is have some issues!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkPacker could you see 2 loss Iowa State hit #10 tonight? I’m thinking yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkPacker Best game of the year so far. IMO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkPacker Lot more too it obviously but I’m limited by characters on twitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkPacker if I can’t get through on the lines today can you answer if you think... next Tuesday a 1 loss Clemson could get the 4 spot?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GregMcElroy I don’t have the number to call in this morning but one thing not mentioned on the show is that the committee takes into consideration injuries and home/away for losses. I think thats why Clemson may be 4 or 5 if they win this weekend. Plus brand...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wishing I could be at @SumnerGunSupply letting freedom ring. Alas, I’ll have to wait until the weekend. #adulting #mysafespace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkPacker Totally agree. Tough sledding when the D is on the field that long. Penalties were a killer and so was the kicking game. Just got to regroup and come out swinging. We aren’t out of it yet and #9 is still a stud! #LetsGoTigers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkPacker That ones on Dabo. Terrible coaching and Bryant shouldn’t have been in the game at all. Honestly, Johnson should have come in the game. Much better passer than Cooper and he can hand the ball of to the trio of back just as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkPacker our boys need to get going! Good thing #9 is a bad man! Let’s Go Tigers!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkPacker as a fellow Clemson fan what do you think about #9? Seems like the real deal to me! #FreeTravis<|endoftext|>
