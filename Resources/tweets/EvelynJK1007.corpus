I’m sure they have children at home. I seriously doubt if  they’re capable of raising children.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wendyrance I’ve never known anyone to wear sunglasses to look or appear to be “cool”.  But again I’ve never asked anyone why they wear sunglasses either.

<|startoftext|>@LauraDiBella15 @JeffreyGuterman Yes indeed mine too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've always been perplexed that Senator Joe Manchin from the great State of West Virginia is involved in the Democratic party.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>David Bossie: Trump adviser gets coronavirus, sources say - CNNPolitics  https://t.co/qCrTTP1Vt3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I miss him #GoodTrouble<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Calvin09734608 Barr was/is a good pick to be Trump’s fixer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Melissa_VA_757 I’m not going to concern myself with 2024. Trump has the attention span of a gnat. His fat ass is still parked in the Oval Office so we’re not done with him yet. I’m more concerned with Trump’s attempt at a coup right now.  Think about that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Katy00008281 @jacobsoboroff @brguest20 Yes 666 is the mark of the beast. To be honest I think Trump is something far more worse than the devil himself. May God be with us all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willthink4food2 For #PeteButtigieg  I would to see him be in charge of the Department of Veterans Affairs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/5e9AdN8JoJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSnotty He’s going to do as much damage and destruction as possible. And more<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@49_carpenter @CraigCheryl @MaryLTrump Yep<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiannaMaria @NonaDay97577029 @MaryLTrump He doesn’t give a shit about Covid.  Trump will do a lot of damage in the way out.  If he even gets out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NonaDay97577029 @MaryLTrump I wouldn’t know why he didn’t do anything or accomplish anything the entire time he was there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSnotty  https://t.co/NvTAJBqSas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I could get used to this Joe Biden guy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC It's so refreshing to have a normal President speaking in a normal manner.  Not once did Biden talk about how smart he is, how rich he is or that his people are the best.  This is just awesome--and it's only going to get better. #PresidentElectBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@godz_metal Imagine that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@godz_metal Do not listen to Trump--especially what he says about Covid.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@egheitasean Ho Hum<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dukewindsor388 I wouldn’t care if he up and left the White House today.  This nightmare needs to end. Get the hell out of our lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Acosta @MollyM12658847 Trump advisers days are numbered so they my as well be truthful.  They’ll move on and find other jobs.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden @DouglasEmhoff Praise the Lord<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickwtyler I haven’t been looking for her.  I don’t care<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dukewindsor388 I just want the Trump’s out of DC. And that might take some doing getting him to leave the Oval Office. But that’s why we have trespassing laws.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@funder @realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SelfPub101 @MaryLTrump Mary’s book is great read.  I read it upon release. You should read it yourself. It’s excellent<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MaryLTrump He must not be sleeping much. He was on Twitter at 2:30 am.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickwtyler He has no basis to take this to the Supreme Court. As far as it will get will be recounts a couple of States. But he will never concede.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CincyRadiohead @870South 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marknevertrump @thomaskaine5 Yes--He won the last election with the help of Russia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsJeffTiedrich TRUMP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thomaskaine5 He has verbally abused us all, many of us have lost family members because of his incompetency.  Many Americans will be losing their healthcare over his jealousy of Obama. Trump is not suited to be President at all and I don't give a damn how many votes he got.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thomaskaine5 HELLO NO!!!! Has he even left yet??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dr Jill Biden will be a great First Lady 💙💙💙<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Patsgirl777 Trump will NOT concede<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atdavidhoffman Oh you changed your profile pic--cute as can be.  Your husband is hot!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it official?? What's happening??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@UncleSnotty That some train wreck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Embarrassing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaryLTrump This is embarrassing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaryLTrump He’s saying people are calling him and sending him things because they understand?? They who?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSnotty He’s always complaining that someone has done him wrong. This is complete bullshit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dukewindsor388 He might be in prison in 2024<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yeahokisee @thomaskaine5 He won’t go back to New York and live because he lost NY.  He’ll go Mar-a-Lago—he won Florida.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Acosta I don't care where he's at<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffreyGuterman @atrupar I hope they're in Biden's favor.  Trump says he's going to challenge and have an investigation and he will win<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robotwrestler @atrupar that would be awesome<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@eugenegu Violence is Trump's middle name<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thomaskaine5 I"m not worried about what Trump is going to do in 4 years.  His attention span is that of a child so--<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CallMeDavid2020 I'm at work and trying to find out what the vote count is in PA right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan Oh you know it--I hope the White House photographer is near by.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thomaskaine5 Trump turned our country into a toilet. From Kidnapping children to making hate and racism fashionable.  And violence is much acceptable with little to no consequences.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Irishman727 First I heard about this.  Where are you getting this at?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DanielKurle Oh hell no honey they won’t be hauling ass until January...if we’re all lucky<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SurvivingMyWay Trump supporters are not typical Republicans that would follow, support and vote for Bush or Romney. I doubt if many Trumpets follow politics. I think they like the roughness of how he talks and they believe his lies.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@investor_hilda you have Bitcoin in your bio—not interested.  No need to follow me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's extremely frustrating for me to understand how Trump is even competitive in this election. Actually it's rather frightening. He's the most incompetent President we've every had. He's a major threat to America,this is a basic fact  How can anyone support someone so malicious?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stonecold2050 Perfect comparison though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stonecold2050 Have you given any thoughts about Trump complaining and taking it to the Supreme Court and the SC pushing him on through as the winner?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kenster13 @Scaramucci Mooch probably has election anxiety like I do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scaramucci It isn’t that this President and Administration doesn’t grasp the “magnitude” of COVID and other problems that American families are facing right now.  It’s that they don’t care. There’s a difference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSnotty I like The Waltons<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSnotty It’s hard though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Covid is on the rise and so are Trump’s poll numbers. He doesn’t give a shit about the pandemic or human life. What’s happening?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mstone1104 I understand what you are saying<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Trump has these rallies all day long but yet he doesn’t speak about his platform or his vision for our country.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dukewindsor388 We the American people deserve better. It’s unreal why half the country is wanting to keep this guy in office. This election shouldn’t be close at all.  Our country has lost so much decency.  I want Biden to win by a landslide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dukewindsor388 No it’s not you. He continues to say “we’re turning the corner on COVID.”  I sure hope Biden wins by a landslide<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CBSNews I actually listen to Dr. Fauci and I trust him. He is a highly intelligent doctor who relies on scientific facts &amp; bases his recommendations accordingly along with past experiences. Science has been a subject in our education system for decades. Science is a wonderful asset<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBSNews Absolutely ridiculous that a 79 year old man has to have armed body guards because he’s doing his job.  His poor family..  his kids must be so worried.  It’s awful.  I feel so ashamed of what people have become.<|endoftext|>

He likes to put on a show.  He's a showman and a poor one at that. On election day I'll be a nervous wreck--I'll probably be breathing into a paper bag<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Ohio early voting starts today!!  Let's do this #Ohio #VoteBlue  #BidenHarrisLandslide<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan You better believe it needs to go higher.  It's still too close. Vote early!! No matter where you live vote early!! #BidenHarrisLandslide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsJeffTiedrich Trump has the nerve to cut healthcare for millions in the middle of a pandemic.  #VoteHimOut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReportsDaNews Psychotic Deplorable Ass<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Graftacus Karen Pence looks old<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jpierni @KathyHoldshope I’ve never been a fan of #KatieCouric<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@liza943truelove @thehill So obvious he’s a sick old man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@otheranthony @thehill I noticed his difficulty breathing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill What’s damn side show!  This entire White House is a sick side show—right down to that press secretary #kayleighmcenany<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RickLarango Oh yeah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ladyred1956 @ReportsDaNews He sure did<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan I watched Joe Biden too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SnakeBadAss  https://t.co/FN6kzxJFZn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piyushmittal @kayleighmcenany @JJ00923527 @realDonaldTrump I noticed that too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParZevil I made vegetable soup. Slow cooked in the crock pot all day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReportsDaNews I wonder how much Trump weighs?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReportsDaNews Oh you know it. I expect him to be holding rallies by the weekend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyVBehar I feel exactly the same.  It’s frightening as hell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrRobDavidson @slskc Thank you doctor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TG22110 Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robandfred Maybe we shouldn’t cuss in front of little Fred though??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LepapillonBlu I know I know it’s frightening. It really is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InTheNoosphere Please don’t insult my Lucy  https://t.co/LncMnh9jPh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ConscienceIsIt He wants to show everyone he’s still strong enough to be President. I don’t know. He’s insane and has respect for no one. Including his own staff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MysterySolvent He has make up lines for Christ sakes. He’s dangerously insane<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He has no regard for his own staff. Shedding the virus all over the place. Assuming his supporters thinks he’s really cool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He’s a fucking asshole. I hope to Christ he loses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has anyone heard if the White House has been disinfected and sanitized?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So he just tweeted he’s ready to go back on the campaign trail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lezleemac I don’t care if he’s sick or healthy. Trump’s not getting my vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dstiddypop43  https://t.co/viVH2zOvU3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't believe Trump is still President and allowed to run for re-election.  It’s beyond my comprehension.    It’s also difficult to believe that he has supporters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now Trump will be our Covid expert. He knows more than his doctors<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No matter the subject or situation. Trump spins chaos, confusion and turmoil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ava He is senseless.  He really is and this is all we will hear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rcn400 We won't really know until someone from the inside quits and writes a tell all book.  Might not be until he's out of office<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joncoopertweets @kayleighmcenany Sit down girl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@democraticbear I can't believe Trump is still President and allowed to run for re-election.  I also can't believe he has supporters.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JosephMoscato1 @rickwtyler @realDonaldTrump I'm sorry about you and your family.  Families parting ways over politics shouldn't happen at all.

<|startoftext|>@MittRomney Help us sir. Please help us all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepAdamSchiff on @maddow now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackHeavner @FPWellman @JoJoFromJerz What did he actually say??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YpsiLouise @FPWellman @kurteichenwald Exactly!! That’s what I said<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@winetipper @FPWellman No his Supreme Court will push him through<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FPWellman @DCR20 Apparently his words didn’t shake any Republican Senators.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@music4ever77 He can’t overtake this country alone the Republicans are allowing him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LucyPesk Go for it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acnewsitics And the Republicans are allowing this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@music4ever77 There’s no sense in putting the American people through this turmoil<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LucyPesk Everyone is losing followers today lady.  All of us<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thomaskaine5 @maddow Who’s on??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@music4ever77 I’m worried sick. I’ve been on edge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Um—Trump doesn’t seem to care about the votes he’s staying anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@music4ever77 I see evil<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sannbailey I cut them off a long time ago.  That’s why I gave up Facebook too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dezyning_mom @thomaskaine5 Oh I don’t give a shit what it’s called. I still need to keep my healthcare lady<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rcn400 Never!! And I’ll never forgive them for allowing Trump to get this far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@escura1 Well I actually listened and trusted the doctors. Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LottieResister @ddale8 Ok<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanielleCandela @ddale8 Well yes. Dictators are usually insane. Seriously<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LottieResister @ddale8 The GOP Senate did not impeach him last time. What makes you think they would now??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IleneMann20 @ddale8 @IanMcPHE7T2 Ditto. Many of us<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeniseS49718134 @HartmanForPA @atrupar Outside of voting what do you suggest?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkThebigranch @HartmanForPA @GMcFerren He can tie it up forever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HartmanForPA @andymoonsun @BrennanCenter Not going to be a landslide. I’m hearing so many things. If Trump wins Florida he won the election. And the Supreme Court will push him through. I’m hearing lots of things<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickLodz @HartmanForPA @atrupar You mean just like they did William Barr?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Twitter must be doing a bot clean up today  🚫BOTS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MadaGeetha @rayleengale I have no clue if there are more of us or not. He cheats. And if he loses I’m hearing the Supreme Court can push him through. Votes and numbers don’t matter much so it seems<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MadaGeetha @rayleengale You and me both<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rayleengale I’m hearing if Trump doesn’t concede the Supreme Court will push him through. Nothing we can do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSnotty Mine too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NEWMERICA92 @realDonaldTrump Personally I don’t. But I look for him to get re-elected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSnotty Thank you. You’re awesome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is it 2020 just keep getting worse?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRickyDavila 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSnotty I’m sitting worried I offended you. OMG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Melissa_VA_757 I’m losing followers right and left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSnotty Oh no no I didn’t mean anything like that at all.  He just always seems to be with you is what I meant. No no no<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@roper_93 You are correct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSnotty Is he closer to you than your wife?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffreyGuterman I need to finish frosting my carrot cake<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSnotty I got mine a couple weeks ago at Sam’s Club Pharmacy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDavidJW Hahahahaha😂😂😂😂😂😂😂  You’re simple<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RosannaPhillip I am doing mail voting but I hand delivered my completed Request for Ballot to the Board of Elections drop off box (they have cameras on it).  I understand not everyone can do this. Personally I'm not interested in electronic voting or USPS. I feel great about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Massive genetic study shows coronavirus mutating and potentially evolving amid rapid U.S. spread  https://t.co/WOOdLlSyZT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What happen to the White House Coronavirus Task Force that was headed up by Pence, Faucci and Birx??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSnotty Many people have posted the past few weeks that their followers were gone. That’s all I know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thomaskaine5 I’ve been struggling. It certainly doesn’t look good for the American people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSnotty He's such a racist hateful person<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patschurman @Morning_Joe Oh no I would say they show up on their own free will<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MusingDave @DorothyAshford3 @Morning_Joe I don't see this ending anytime soon--I expect him to  re-elected.  Either with or without cheating<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DorothyAshford3 @Morning_Joe Or---some of his supporters actually agree with his hate and racist bullshit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexnazaryan She’s such a fraud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@David26426457 @funder  https://t.co/tw9mDD1FHJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@funder I'm convinced this racist mob family can do whatever they want and get away with it.  But I don't know why.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@roadrunner1941 I want to believe that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSnotty I’ll go with you but I’ll have to squat. I’m a squatter. Turn you head please<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RickLarango You better believe--one dangerous person<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmyAThatcher What in the actual hell is happening in our country?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CAnxiolytic How in the hell can you endorse this book? Or any book---we all know by now that you don't read.  Or maybe you can't read.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSnotty GOP Healthcare plan in the making?? No I do not. Trump doesn’t know shit about health insurance coverage. MAGA zero!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bullpin451 Sad and depressing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hpy4evrmor @LottieResister @kylegriffin1 That’s exactly what I’ve been saying all along.  #CNN and #MSNBC spend all day preaching the polls. And Trump knows good and well he’s going to win. He doesn’t care how he wins and how many COVID deaths—meaningless to that man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>200,000 dead and he holds a huge rally and made nasty racist comments of two female members of Congress and his crowd cheered. What kind of people are they?Racism is ignorant to me. ThIs bunch has no respect for their fellow man at all. I’m outraged<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bullpin451 This is exactly what I think is going to happen. I’ve said it all along.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PalmerReport Best list ever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ConscienceIsIt So true<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesKosur Scary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RickLarango Yes indeed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@roadrunner1941 Trump cheats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Petefarnham I’ve never had anxiety over an election before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSnotty @politicususa I hope this is factual. I’m really getting seriously worried<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Worked all day and now I’m home. I don’t even have the damn news on. The same depressing news day after day. Trump stirring up shit and more people dying of COVID. I feel like I’m living in a deep dark black hell hole created by Trump and there’s no way out.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@UncleSnotty I just sent an email to my Ohio Republican Senator about Health Insurance.  Looking forward to hearing back from him.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@UncleSnotty Ain’t scared<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@txquila1 @realDonaldTrump What difference does it make if he did or didn’t?  Not going to change my feelings about him. I hate the SOB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@funder #BidenHarris<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSnotty I would think a 70 plus year old man would have a bit more maturity to him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSnotty But I still see his flags and signs in yards. Nice homes too. And farmlands.  I can only assume these people are getting big returns in the stock market .  Hell if I know!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahgirlwonder Following his rants<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@varindersingh24 It's bad shit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 It would hurt the stock market and economy. #Numbers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSnotty Have a good Monday 😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rogerasalways If they have no profile pic, account is new, few followers—it sets off a red flag for me. So no<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KopoSale Where do I carry my cosmetic bag??  Not interested<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Susan78English @UncleSnotty @politicususa It really doesn’t sound right.  Let Trump and #MoscowMitch do what they do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bottles97251382 @stayceespeaks Well that’s you and I’m me. Don’t let what I do bother you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cryborg I never watch him. I don’t like the way he looks or his voice<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@annacabey1 I’m so sorry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmyAThatcher Trump is a sociopath—bigly<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Stef07134097 I’m right here honey.  You are not alone.  Just look at all of us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSnotty Does he have a loud bark?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSnotty We save the twist ties<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSnotty Is that dinner?? Your O says the cow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thomaskaine5 Why do so many people have his signs and flags in their yards?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mdnij34 I won’t<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSnotty Eggs and hand on garlic toast??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NZdrama_llama @FuturehopeMs Can you believe he actually brags about how many lives he has saved though?  He’s totally nuts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 @ldylkngb Children have we not learned anything from 2016 about political polls?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Can Trump cancel the election by Executive Order?? Anyone know??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mdnij34 Executive Orders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSnotty I had Sonic yesterday. Two ladies brought the food out to my car wearing no masks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YanaarL @haaohaoo And when I drive around and see Trump signs and huge flags—and on nice homes too and real nice farmland.  I start to question my damn self. Like many be In missing something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YanaarL @haaohaoo I see Trump signs/flags everywhere. Can’t understand why so many cherish him in such a high regard. He didn’t protect anyone Covid19. He didn’t protect our troops from Russian bounties. He hasn’t brought our country, our nation together. He keeps us divided us. We need leadership<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Paul_VanDerMeer I hope so.  OMG I hope that’s the way it goes. Biden signs are few and far between<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSnotty Never been to one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidmweissman #2020 is depressing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nixw20 I notice you pop up in my newsfeed often. I wouldn’t mind giving you a big follow. I actually like your tweets to be honest. I’m a little over 2000 followers and I’m totally happy with that. I’m on Twitter because it’s better than Facebook and I’m a news junkie #BidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MysterySolvent Jared looks like he’s had more botox injections<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PegLulu2 No need for you to feel embarrassed.  The idiot should feel embarrassed   Here’s a hug for you.   Take care of yourself  https://t.co/LBCl9f7c7Z<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FLOTUS OMG  0k I need to take my meatloaf out of the oven<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atdavidhoffman I hope you and your husband are feeling alright.  Been thinking of you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dywebs I’ve always enjoyed displaying political signs in my yard. But it’s not politics as usual anymore. I’m fearful of property damage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I done some traveling today. Trump signs 20 to 1 of Biden. I was out in rural area. Nice homes too. South central Ohio  #Depressing<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Calvin09734608 😂😂😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LamontFrazier4 You're not concerned that a foreign country will help Trump cheat and win?  And yest I'm going to vote just like I always do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sandyan57549867 @BillKristol @RVAT2020 And I still say that Trump will win---with the help of cheating by a foreign country<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sandyan57549867 @BillKristol @RVAT2020 And he still is---every single day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillKristol @RVAT2020 Trump doesn't just hate his supporters, Latinos,  BLM, etc.  Trump doesn't like anyone that is beneath him. Trump likes his well to do equals--people with money like Epstein and Roger Stone.  If you are not rich and can do something for him he doesn't have any interest in you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSnotty No it isn’t.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Phillip2020Vote @realDonaldTrump Good Morning!! I’m so ready for fall and enjoying the cooler temperatures we’ve been having here in Ohio. I’m ready for the holidays despite this pandemic—I’m ready for Autumn and all its colors.  https://t.co/GSd9TaM3um<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump This is exactly how I feel  https://t.co/OQYq5MmJ6p<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jacobsoboroff @3rdHourTODAY @nbc You’re awesome Jacob.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaureennKelly I certainly do.  I mask up while walking my dog.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mean_Bitch_Dem Sounds good. I look forward to hearing from you😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A scrapped plan to ship masks to Americans. A standoff with Amazon amid pressure from Trump. New documents detail …  https://t.co/fXNejiFmyp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To the people that have Trump signs in their yard. What the hell are you bragging about? What are you proud of? You’re living in the same country I am. We’re living in a pandemic. I feel that my life is on hold Our President isn’t an educated man at all.He put our lives in danger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RickLarango You and me both. Everyday I feel like I’m holding my breath. I feel that my life is on hold. I kid you not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RickLarango Happy Thursday friend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@magpiebutts Good Morning Miss Maggie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSnotty I think these cooler temps feel great.  I have the windows up. I love autumn, my favorite time of the year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good Morning Everyone Happy Thursday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonWheeze I’m so sorry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stumpycat1145 @TurbidCanuck @CDCDirector Many others have done the same and are now serving prison time.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@luis21428816 Wow look nothing like your profile pic at all.  Totally<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@varindersingh24 Literally within the past 5 minutes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @ABC The monkey in your small head is getting louder  https://t.co/N2IdPKn6Aw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atdavidhoffman Oh I'm so very sorry to hear this.  How are you both feeling?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/Mo5GOLEzsq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevTra57 Take care of yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevTra57 Bahahahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevTra57 I gotta get back to work. Nice talking with you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevTra57 Real pretty to take drives in the fall around here.  Appalachian regions are scenic. West Virginia is beautiful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevTra57 He's sounds disgusting and most disturbing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevTra57 Ross County is red as can be.  I always enjoyed putting political yard signs out but not this time.  This isn't normal political differences.  Trump really isn't even a Republican to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevTra57 Wow you're good! You know right where I'm at Chillicothe aka Pillicothe to some<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevTra57 Not any violence to speak of.  A lot of pick up trucks with loud mufflers (red neck) with Trump flags.  I do look for a Trump caravan/parade of trucks to happen around here though.  A lot of cities and town will be seeing those.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevTra57 I'm in Ross County, Ohio (Appalachian region)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevTra57 Oh I'm going to vote just like I always have. But I fear the worse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/rOvOQCRjpj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevTra57 I'm in Ohio---more Trump signs than Biden.  But many Biden supporters are fearful to put up a Biden sign due to property damage.  We feel intimidated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevTra57 He certainly has--I'm still predicting he will get re-elected.  No one has bothered to stop Putin/Russian from fingering in our election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmsKateB @PatriciaRork It's apparent Trump thrives on drama.  It actually energizes him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevTra57 I get you--I really do especially the lack of not having many places to go and things to do.  He has literally stopped us from living.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSnotty Best of luck friend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSnotty  https://t.co/KqMadPz13V<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ASqwatch @HSlaughter1979 It’s terrible that I and others I know feel intimidated to put a #BidenHarris sign in my yard. I’ve always had political signs in my yard—I enjoy it. But this is not politics as usual. It’s not normal. Trump is a tyrant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ASqwatch @HSlaughter1979 I’m in southern Ohio. Biden signs are few and far between. But some people are fearful of putting them up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hotdiggityDR @HSlaughter1979 Oh you’re not kidding. He’s overwhelmingly. There’s always something going on and it’s always a big deal.  Voting by mail and the post office. If it wasn’t that it would be something else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_SJPeace_ Love this!! I love cats. All cats💙<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump takes a toll on me. The lies, corruption, his voice, constant bragging, tweeting and talking about the damn stock market, mocking people, his rallies, his damn kids. He doesn’t know what he’s doing-he’s not suited to be President. He’s good for nothing and no one.I’m fed up<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thehill Well I think Pelosi has given up on everything though.  I don't see her on news programs much anymore.  Not a whole lot more she can do with this administration.  That's how I see it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MysterySolvent An elderly overweight broad with a goofy hairstyle. Why does she color her hair yellow?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Why is Trump still President?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Christo52048542 @gtconway3d @60Minutes He's a journalist that does his job. He has interviewed many Presidents over the years. And let's just say Woodard is rich/well to do--he has earned his living honestly.  I have no problems with others being "rich" as long as they've done it honestly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@varindersingh24 Do you feel like your 11 years old??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chickiebabe2u If you are so worried and concern why did you even bother inviting them?? Damned if I would<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GregMolidor Trump doesn't give a shit who lives and who dies.  The American people are not his first priority.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSNBC Autocrats/Dictators don't pay attention to their own Government administrations or leaders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WOsrin No because he is tested at an ongoing basis.  And just because he catches it doesn't mean he will become ill.  Many people don't become ill with Covid-19.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@UncleSnotty Thanks friend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@funder @realDonaldTrump Wishful thinking--sounds good but wishful thinking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/5aZThpYjnr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@antoni Thank you Antoni.  You are correct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSnotty His speech must have been amazing.  I'm at work sorry I missed it.  I needed to hear it too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffreyGuterman I remember well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DearAuntCrabby @JoeBiden Makes me feel a little better.  Yesterday felt like we were living in hell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PalmerReport Thanks for the update Palmer.  I'm at work--I'll see the highlights when I get home<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrBiden These guys are so real and down to earth🧚🏽💙<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pantomath__ I don't have much negativity on here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProjectLincoln You don't have to convince me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bookworm_monk Maybe--If you are comfortable you can send me a private message.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bookworm_monk I'm sorry--silent??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thomaskaine5 Because that's what evil with mental illness does<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beachaholic823  Love your hair<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bookworm_monk I like reading.  I have a Kindle and I enjoy political memoirs, I'm boring I guess.  I can understand monks would enjoy reading---when they're not praying. There's a group of monks online that make and sell fruit cakes during the holiday season<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JTHVerhovek @JoeBiden Joe has always been active in a gym and taking care of himself throughout his life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmyAThatcher @DCR20 This is just the beginning.  These #TrumpCaravans will be a shit storm in many cities across our country until election day.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CNNPolitics Why in the hell would anyone want to live in Trump's violence?  Who are the people that do and what are the wanting?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 Covid-19 is not an issue for this administration. Trump divorced himself from this issue months ago. He would rather not bring it up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill So why the hell is he bothering to go?  He was asked not to show up--he was asked by the Governor yesterday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bookworm_monk Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bookworm_monk I absolutely love this. Thank you for sharing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump LIES AND LIES<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@UncleSnotty Do you think it’s sort of like drinking the kool aid??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSnotty I guess for the Dems to have a platform, a vision and not to promote violence is weak and wrong. Trump has himself in place now I guess<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSnotty And it’s ok for the President to promote violence on Twitter??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSnotty 😂😂😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LinderAr @Morning_Joe Yes and he preaches daily he’s doing a great job, he’s the best thing that has happened to us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Morning_Joe Trump will do anything to stay in power. He will stop at nothing. He doesn’t have a platform, he has no vision—just Trump and continued violence. #Autocrat<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dginkle @ChiVoltage66 @AngryCanuck70 I'm good but thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kokomothegreat This is not ok.  Does some people find this acceptable?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kokomothegreat They don't even try to hide their dirty racism. What has our country become?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CRO68433431 @StevijoPayne Thank you. And this make perfect sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atdavidhoffman With all of what we have been told--with what we know why is Trump still President??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@metztlion @StevijoPayne So true<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thomaskaine5 This is criminal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Makes no sense to me why Trump has faith in this MyPillow guy and listens to him but not an educated man like  Dr. Fauci<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan @solusnan1 Good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PalmerReport So what can be done about it now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm certainly not going to--Not interested<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Spockout1 Fire him today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSnotty @politicususa He can say one thing and do the opposite.  If he was hired by Trump--I don't trust him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump He's not right in the head---I don't know I can't figure it out.  He's bizarre for sure.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChiVoltage66 @MTC_CO Adorable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I wasn't angry under the #Obama administration.  I got up every morning went to work and came home--no big deal.  My life was freaking normal. You make life a struggle.  Trying to cut off my healthcare is a hardship and causes me anxiety. You are a terrible person Mr. Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sarah_Yael_Gold He's irrelevant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump And you are losing your Senate seat<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I'm voting for #BidenHarris--I want a team that has integrity and class. I don’t want someone sitting in the oval office who allows Russia to put bounties on American Soldiers.

<|startoftext|>@thomaskaine5 It seems that Christians love and support Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Road_2_Ft_Worth @EileenPMcLaugh2 And some people are still not believing him. Trump considers Global warming a hoax.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PalmerReport Like I said--I'm not paying attention to polls.  All of us should just vote #2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN I'm staying away from what the polls are showing.  #2016 is a bad memory for me<|endoftext|>
