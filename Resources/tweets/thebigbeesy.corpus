<|startoftext|>Our newest episode podcast released yesterday!  https://t.co/keDE1C9MtZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😷😳  https://t.co/e0rKYnV4Sg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sambacon25 @mrrippel @realDonaldTrump @EricTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr There is also state law vs federal law, state law can say whatever you want about counting votes late but federal law says electors must be chosen on November 4th. This cannot be argued in state court but will be in front of the Supreme Court. Context is also important.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sambacon25 @mrrippel @realDonaldTrump @EricTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr It’s the states responsibility to produce results on the same day according to federal law to not allow room for fraud. Just because states are ill prepared to tabulate the results on that day or choose to ignore the law does not invalidate what congress has already decided.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@makeBTCdaily Awesome article!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrrippel @realDonaldTrump @EricTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Supreme Court will vote 5/4 to only count votes on Election Day for the Presidential portion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congress ruled that Presidential elections must be held for one day only all the way back in 1845 to keep fraud from running rampant due to the invention of the Telegraph. @realDonaldTrump @EricTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr #Trump #ElectionDay  https://t.co/LS2OtxudRK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealPLU That is out of context with out the rest of the article<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Supreme Court will side with Federal law and toss all late votes for both sides thus Trump wins presidency and you can blame your state for that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Asianwhale88 I would think that most people believe aliens exist. It’s just amazing all the crazy shit that is going on right now ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Asianwhale88 I did watch that interview last year. Would make sense. However I think if aliens are here and it was preflood it is linked to what we call demons and the fallen ones from the ancient texts that exist. I honestly believe they are in Antarctica and in the earth still living today<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealPLU @PeteButtigieg Lol I have no vote for any of these candidates even though i do believe no one stands a chance against Trump, I also would have to counter that our constitution was sacrificed along time ago,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LKfighter I would like to hear about what they have done other then make Trump a priority for 3 years. But you are spot on.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Internxt @starrddust “Storage Materials” refers to any User Content provided or otherwise processed via our Services for storage on the Storage Platform.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Internxt @starrddust (a) The Services include areas that allow users to create, post, upload, share or store content, including, but not limited to, photos, videos, sound, text, graphics, code, items or other information and materials, including Storage Materials (collectively, “User Content”).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Internxt @starrddust So just to be sure what just happened, you just removed the entire section "d", from the terms and conditions? Was just trying to see the changes, and also what storage materials ARE you able to scan?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Internxt @starrddust Well I appreciate the response, says alot about your team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@starrddust @Internxt I may be wrong hoping for some clarification, it does say "other then storage materials" clarification of that would be great. @Internxt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Twitter when are you going to launch a enhanced video gallery for each profile and give @youtube a run for their money. They f*ck their creators over 150%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@starrddust @Internxt maybe @Internxt is saying they cant scan items?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@starrddust @Internxt I may be reading it wrong though  https://t.co/nK9gNYldba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@starrddust @Internxt This looked promising however in their terms they claim to have end to end encryption however they also say they can screen your files. This makes me wonder how they are able to screen encrypted files.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abhanja I haven't tried anywhere at all at this point, was looking to source ideas from the community first.<|endoftext|>
