<|startoftext|>@HillaryClinton You're right for once. It wasn't close. He beat biden. Just like he beat you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deesnider Not as bad as democrats though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redpainter1 I'll never understand democrats period. Or how they voted for a blatant pedophile<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@goldiehawn Kurt Russell is the greatest actor, possibly ever. Big Trouble in Little China is easily the greatest movie of all time. Please tell him this. Also, the family and I loved #ChristmasChronicles2. Great job!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealSkipBayless Good shit Skip. For real. Nice job<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TooBigForYou12 No. Because she was born a woman. Soooooooo....she'll always be a woman. Because that's how genetics and biology work<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeJFenton @SavageBoston Video evidence will hold up. It's video.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeJFenton @SavageBoston Have you not been watching any of the news channels? They have evidence. Have you not seen the video of the lady bringing out the bins of ballots that were all for Biden? The ballots she scanned multiple times?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamalaHarris @JoeBiden  https://t.co/NRPTnJHOm0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheCinemaTicket The answer is Predator. It's the only right answer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iheartmindy  https://t.co/oVAkCIpJo2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RexChapman @JoyTaylorTalks As they should. Maybe if the shit sucking democrats didn't rig the election in the first place, we wouldn't have this problem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston Because the election was illegal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deesnider Trump? You mean the guy who is gonna be president for the next four years? Not looking good for your boy biden. If it goes to the Supreme Court, biden stands zero chance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therecount No they're not. Stop spewing your bullshit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BLABBERMOUTHNET Are they transgender now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyCaller  https://t.co/XHN3qKDxqP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ANewEnglandGuy @BostonStrong_34 Agreed. Definitely needs to be dealt with. I do like the idea of Kluber though, if its a short and cheap deal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ANewEnglandGuy @BostonStrong_34 I'd rather have him, save the money you'd spend on Springer or Ozuna and spend it on pitching<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dbl11s2 @kschwarb12 @RedSox He hit 39 homers last year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dbl11s2 @kschwarb12 @RedSox Naaaaaah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OverTheMonster Nah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kschwarb12 Has Boston @redsox written all over him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BostonStrong_34 Everybody saying shit about pitching, just calm your tits, ok? We all know they need pitching. Obviously. But one of their outfielders is also a free agent. Which means they have a hole in the OF. It needs to be filled. And he's cheaper than Springer or Ozuna<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ANewEnglandGuy @BostonStrong_34 Just saying. He's a left fielder. He'd be a lot cheaper than Springer or Ozuna, and has a better bat than JBJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TooBigForYou12 Biden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BostonStrong_34 He'd hit bombs at Fenway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ANewEnglandGuy @BostonStrong_34 JD DH's. You put Schwarber in left<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BostonStrong_34 Waste of 1.25 mil<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jared_Carrabis Cool. They need a real closer now though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisCotillo They better get an actual closer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BostonStrong_34 You spelled Rosario and Schwarber wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston @JakeGeico Please. Dont hurt me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonHeyman @Ken_Rosenthal @BNightengale Hey @RedSox<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jared_Carrabis Chances of Schwarber, Mazara, or Eddie Money (Rosario) to Boston?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston Well so are democrats, so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@choptopmoseley Kinda like biden on stages, with underage kids<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sonsoftexas Can't wait til you guys come back to the Chicagoland area. Mark told me on Instagram we could have a beer, and I'm holding his ass to it!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BostonStrong_34 Bauer, Lester, and yates or colome. Get it done<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pasha21k @BostonStrong_34 @JLester34 Henry kinda pushed him out the door though. Shouldn't have low balled him in the first place. I think he'd come back to be honest. Even after the bullshit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pasha21k @BostonStrong_34 @JLester34 He said he was open to coming back and finishing where it started. Plus, money talks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsdorothysucka Absolutely! Can't wait to hear the new stuff. Take care of yourself and be safe!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BostonStrong_34 Give me @JLester34. They need durability. Ol Jonny is the definition<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsdorothysucka How's your life going with all the crazy shit happening in the world?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alex_vincent @realDonaldTrump @OANN And there has literally been pollsters come out and say they saw fraud in bidens favor. In multiple states. Why do you think he barely campaigned? He knew he didn't have to. The fix was in long before the election was even close to happening<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alex_vincent @realDonaldTrump @OANN Dude. Are you seriously trying to tell me 80M people voted for Biden? The guy who sniffs and gropes underage kids and can't form a complete sentence? Who had how many votes randomly show up int the middle of the night in Michigan? No. Sorry. There is no way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alex_vincent @realDonaldTrump @OANN Here you go buddy  https://t.co/QONtM3ZNQJ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@marcmaron Hahahahaha so you think right wingers are bigger "babies" than leftists, huh? Why? Because your side cheated a presidential election and we're pissed about it? The left didn't stop crying about 2016 until Nov 3rd, 2020....pal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is for everyone claiming there's no evidence of fraud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A wise man once said...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like how all the libs are crying about #MelaniaHatesChristmas or whatever, but still won't comment on Biden groping and sniffing underage kids<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GerryCallahan Colbert when he sees the traitor  https://t.co/AfuduJrau9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vivie_love816 @jennajameson I said nothing about you. I also said nothing about accepting gay people or not. Accepting them is fine. Treating them more important than straight people is bullshit. Theyre not anymore special. Dems like to act like they are. Yet they're all about equality?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vivie_love816 @jennajameson Do you not understand what happened in Pennsylvania either? Dems are scumbags. Their way of thinking is beyond fucked up. The way they want to control everyone is pathetic. They think there's more than 2 genders. And they want to raise taxes. Keep going?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vivie_love816 @jennajameson How can you seriously say the election isn't rigged? So 138K votes just fall out of the sky in the middle of the night, in Michigan, and every single one is for Biden? Really?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GLFOP @GerryCallahan Don't tell this to democrats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/QI1whpwE5q<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vivie_love816 @jennajameson Not to mention all the deaths that the Clinton's and Obama are responsible for. Ever hear of Benghazi?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vivie_love816 @jennajameson You people are criminals. You rigged a presidential election<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mari_love816 @jennajameson Nobody hates you. We hate democratic ideology. These people are trying to do a "Great Reset" right in front us, and liberals hatred for Trump has them blind. We don't like biden because he openly sexually assaulted multiple underage girls. In public.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalbertSwan Have you not seen the videos of Biden groping and smelling little kids?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MMortemm Democrats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BauerOutage @AgentRachelLuba C'mon now. Let's make it happen  https://t.co/SVh1SummJt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Democrats are literally fucking insane people. In. Sane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xanderberkeley @TonyTodd54 Yeah. A fair election would have been nice. But you libs couldn't do that, because you would have lost in a landslide. You people also voted for a guy who openly gropes and sniffs children. What about your terrorists in antifa, beating people in the streets?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CSimmsQB @packers @Chiefs @Seahawks @AZCardinals @BuffaloBills @HoustonTexans @Ravens @Chargers @Bengals @Titans This list is ass<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston You people voted for Biden. I dont wanna hear shit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston @CMSepeda27 Democrats aren't doing it right now, cause they've currently accomplished their goal of rigging the election. If you cant open your blind eyes and see that it was CLEARLY rigged, you're part of the problem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kinky_horror Haha I do actually!! I had "Dig" by Mudvayne, as my song forever. Still love that song today.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FB_ARCH1 @AgentRachelLuba @Jared_Carrabis Well yeah. We completely agree, except he won't go to the Mets. Other than that, we're on the same page<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoyTaylorTalks No words on the couple that were attacked though, huh? Guess you didn't see the woman being harassed and attacked while pushing a stroller either? You know....a strolller....with a baby in it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KaitlinOlson Did you get cheated?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan Imagine being so dumb and naive, that you actually think the election wasn't rigged<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MichaelKeaton You do realize you voted for a pedophile, right? Like you hate Trump, ok, whatever. But you literally saw the videos of Biden inappropriately touching young girls and still thought, "Yeah. I'm gonna vote for that." #MoralCompass<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanRather Dude. They cheated.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StephenKing @HorrorDaddysRUs Then show your kids biden and explain to them, he's a pedophile<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GerryCallahan Meth is a nasty fucking drug<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sebastianbach @JoeBiden "Winning" more votes. Hahahaha you moron<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston Transparent? Like 138K votes magically appearing overnight in Michigan? Pretty fucking transparent when it comes to voter fraud, yeah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston Have you seen Biden? He can't form a sentence, doesn't know where he is half the time. Oh. And likes to force himself on young girls. Can't forget that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston Biden is embarrassing to everyone<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@therecount @AshleyRParker @PressSec Yeah. She's got something to back it up, jackass. How about Michigan and Pennsylvania? Potentially Nevada? I think that's enough evidence to "back it up."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RBReich @choptopmoseley Trumps a disgrace? You mean the same Trump who, statistically is one of the most successful presidents we've ever had? Meanwhile your sorry ass votes for this guy  https://t.co/xnVXtOfR4M<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@donliedusadied @UncleSamsNation You voted for a pedophile buddy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshgad @JoyTaylorTalks @MiamiDolphins Miami? Real?  https://t.co/Hrg471Z1wA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JLPtalk Good one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BLABBERMOUTHNET Bullied for being a rock God? Is this a thing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JLPtalk The only thing biden gets behind are minors  https://t.co/Q0vPaWLCF8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GingerRoelofs @iheartmindy Ah yes. Russia dealings, crack smoking, and the raping of underage Chinese girls<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iheartmindy Never forget  https://t.co/BjxkvKx9UV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@philthatremains  https://t.co/2RXBonnxuN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chaim89 @megynkelly Did they go to the Supreme Court yet? No? Ok cool, so there's no loss right now. Gotcha.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Loudwire @MrTommyLand @MikePortnoy @TheBrentSmith Libwire<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandyScottESPN Oh didn't you hear? They think biden actually "won", so that means the election is over, which means COVID is over<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrBJP18 @educardinal @MikePortnoy @hrlf An innuendo? Are you blind? Do you not have YouTube or Google? You can literally go on either and look up MULTIPLE videos of Biden being inappropriate with young girls. But yeah, let's vote for him because "orange man bad". Jesus Christ, you people, I swear<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@educardinal @MikePortnoy @hrlf Fucking hell, THANK YOU!! These people are clueless as to who they are trying to put in office  https://t.co/cmVMnMJaHi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikePortnoy @hrlf Well not everyone is a millionaire rockstar. Us little people have to care about taxes. You used the word compassion in your tweet. Doesn't sound like you care about the little people very much as long as you got yours. Sounds like a typical democrat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikePortnoy You forgot pedophilia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@c0reysc0tt @prattprattpratt Always<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankJCurtin @TomCaron In 2016 the dems were, "Oh this election is rigged, Trump got help from Russia, blah, blah, blah" But the right says that it was rigged in 2020 and we're out of our minds, theres no fixing going on here. But the evidence clearly shows otherwise. So ridiculous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankJCurtin @TomCaron And the 6K votes that were all Trump and then magically there was a "glitch" in the system and then all turned into Biden votes? Give me a break. Oh, and dead people can vote now? It's abundantly clear voter fraud went down<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankJCurtin @TomCaron I want to know how 138K, A) show up in the middle of the night, and the pollsters were like, "oops, didn't see these" and B) How is it even statistically possible to have all 138 be for Biden? Not a one for Trump? Not one. Cmon on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleSamsNation Whats up with the website guys? I'm hoping for some cheating Joe, or fuck democrat t-shirts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@genesimmons Imagine flipping a coin 138K times and having it come up heads every time. Crazy huh? Oh. Hi Michigan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GerryCallahan Probably not. But he's just another Hollywood lackey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Allen_843 @AxshonJ @sutterink Thanks bot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MMortemm Haha it's true. Little bitches.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peter_king  https://t.co/LNBQSjnrcN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MMortemm Hahaha absolutely!! Loved that show by the way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankJCurtin @TomCaron Ah yes. Facts. Democrats hate those.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@illtones @JoyTaylorTalks Hahahaha ok. That's actually hilarious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyTaylorTalks It worked out so well last time too  https://t.co/IJrMAOv9b3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @TheDemocrats. How'd it work out last time?  https://t.co/lO4jrR7qml<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatsyFo85409877 @TomCaron No I'm good. Thanks though, bot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealSpider1 Easy to "win" when it's voter fraud. Tell me Spider, how do dead people vote?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhilNWang @OfficialKat But it's not. And that's the funniest part about it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliesheen Not shocked you support Biden. After all, he likes underage girls and you liked underaged Corey Haim<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MickJagger Mick. Democrats elected a pedophile for christ sakes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoubleVsays @NathanWiley_ @marcmaron We'll just have to wait and see I guess<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sutterink You people voted for a pedophile<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SethMacFarlane Big difference between this and Bush/Gore buddy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@c0reysc0tt @prattprattpratt Well considering he hasn't officially won yet and it's more than likely gonna go to the Supreme Court...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston I have 3 kids. It's weird as fuck. Watch some other videos. Like the ones with him and 7 year old girls on stage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jason_blum @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris Plot twist- it's gonna go to the Supreme Court<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston He doesnt like BBC. He likes underage girls<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This country is full of beta's. The same men who voted Biden, are the same dudes who like to watch other guys fuck their wives #BetaCucks #TrumpWon #YouVotedForAPedo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden You cant even lead your son away from Russia and you wanna lead an entire country?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcmaron Joe isn't president<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sebastianbach @JoeBiden Supreme Court is going to say otherwise numb nuts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdwardNorton @KamalaHarris  https://t.co/b5Di9fRbn5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReeseW Democrats? I know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Loudwire @JoeBiden Libwire<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BLABBERMOUTHNET Supreme Court will say otherwise, but keep celebrating dipshits<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelKeaton Walk off? You mean cheated their balls off?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@buzz_liteyear @edhelms Nothing anyone can do about it at this point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@buzz_liteyear @edhelms We'll see I guess<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@buzz_liteyear @edhelms Supreme Court probably gonna say otherwise buddy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThatKevinSmith @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris On their historic cheating scandal*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edhelms Congrats on the big cheating scandal thats not over yet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston Hey Philadelphia. You cheated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomCaron Too bad they cheated and it'll be going to the courts. It's funny watching democrats get excited over nothing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elizabethgyoung Says the sexual predator. No wonder he likes biden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieleecurtis @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris Does the P stand for pedophile....since that what biden is?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston It's gonna be hilarious when the Supreme Court demands a recount<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scott_Ian Yeah! Let's vote for a guy who molests little kids. Fucking sick pieces of shit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JSB_TV Those pieces of shit voted for a guy who molests little kids<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston Yeah, he hasn't won shit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BostonStrong_34 No he's not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyTaylorTalks You think it's bad now? Just wait and see how it is if that democrat actually gets in office<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kirkmin What a goddamn tool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darrenrovell @ClayTravis Losing? How is Trump losing when the election is clearly rigged and Biden isn't winning shit. Not without voter fraud. Democrats are more nervous right now than Republicans. Dipshits can't even cheat right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmeshiaCross But it was cool for Biden to call them bastards? Got it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WEARETHEENDBAND @Loudwire And they wonder why some people are so anti government<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston Sure. If Tyree cheated and didn't catch it fair and square<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Loudwire Just change your name to libwire already. My God.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jennajameson @chrisricewriter Do it. You got my vote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WEARETHEENDBAND @Loudwire Absolutely. If you win fairly, fine. But to me, the voter fraud is becoming more and more obvious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MMortemm Hahahaha man mayo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Get em king<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Loudwire What's gonna be hilarious, is when it comes out as voter fraud and the democrats didn't win shit. And the best part is, those dipshits think it's actually gonna stick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DevernePersonal @MMortemm So we're just cool with some guy who gropes and sniffs small children now, huh? Please don't ever have children<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edhelms Well. He's getting cheated out of being re-elected, soooooo. He's probably pissed. And rightfully so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustisMarlin @ColinCowherd @mullinsnova I'm cool with anyone talking about social injustice or any type of problems in this country. Athletes or not. That's their American right. But let's be real. Colin totally voted for Biden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden @TonyTodd54 Keep cheating, Joe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@batemanjason Hahahahahaha. Maybe when 138K votes fall from the sky like Michigan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustisMarlin @ColinCowherd @mullinsnova Stereotype much buddy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Luis58541500 @ColinCowherd @mullinsnova The guy that cut ties with Epstein? Apparently you haven't seen the videos of biden smelling and groping little girls. Wanna try again?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ColinCowherd @mullinsnova Hahahaha better than Boston? The city of champs? This coming from the guy who did a 20 min segment about a QB wearing his hat backwards. I'm sure you voted Biden too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MMortemm As soon as Trump gets his recount, it will be over. By a large margin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BLABBERMOUTHNET Baseless huh? So 138K Biden votes showing up in the middle of the night in Michigan is baseless? Holy fuck. These "rockers" have partied much too hard in their prime. The prime many of them are way past.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston But we're cool with pedophiles, who do business with Russia, and also have a son who is in with Russia as well. I guess the laptop with him raping underage Chinese girls is cool with you too? Oh. And the crack. Crack is cool too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston Are you that naive? I mean most democrats are. But Jesus Christ. Wake up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkDuaneMorton If they recount, Trump wins easily. So yes. Please recount<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FreddyInSpace You really think he's out?  https://t.co/uxmNyT4FUX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Perrault You must be talking about the piece of shit who sniffs and gropes little kids<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madisongesiotto The fix is in. It has been<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thereallisaann @timmytank05 How does one get a follow?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyTaylorTalks Oh they just don't wanna be cheated out of a win, because biden randomly had 140K votes show up in the middle of the night in Michigan. But you know, yeah. Same difference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Demand recounts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mapdanda @judgeyourself99 @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Probably the funniest shit I'll hear all day. So thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@judgeyourself99 @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Big difference between losing and being cheated out of a win<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrTommyLand You know when you were quiet? When your son dropped your ass<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods Michigan 2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GlennHowerton I suppose this includes the 138K that apparently fell from the sky in Michigan last night too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyTaylorTalks Or maybe he's right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kinky_horror @JillSchoelen Wait. Are you really a red sox fan?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ColinCowherd And no one taught Michigan how to count<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleBlazer No. Absolutely terrible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BostonStrong_34 Biden didn't do shit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FreddyInSpace Hahahahahahahahaha. "Legitimate" he says<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bradmiska What the fuck does Trump have to do with CNN?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FreddyInSpace Those extra 138K votes sure did help<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JLPtalk @realDonaldTrump Big if<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KayaJones It's over Kaya. This country is fucked<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RubeyRoo @PauleyTeeks @DonaldJTrumpJr Where's Hunter and his crack pipe?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeTakei @LangenkampH Well considering the left clearly rigged this election, don't get your hopes up. Pal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@savorytoday11 @KayaJones Really hope you're right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KayaJones Democrats are not gonna let him win. Period. Even though he clearly should<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston @realDonaldTrump Thats actually not how it works at all. 138K votes don't just magically appear over not, in one state, and all for one candidate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Don't let this happen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston There's a difference between fraud and having 138K votes magically show up and all go for one candidate. Use your head.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BostonStrong_34 Dems rigged this election. And everyone knew it was coming<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Quiggling @iheartmindy @DonaldJTrumpJr @PatriotPartyNV I just dont want Biden or Harris in the oval office. America will be in a bad spot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iheartmindy @DonaldJTrumpJr @PatriotPartyNV I unfortunately don't think Trump is gonna win. He had a very good chance last night. This morning? Not so much. We're all fucked. People who voted for Biden are just too stupid to see it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkRuffalo @realDonaldTrump So 138K votes in Michigan were all for Biden? No. Statistically impossible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Don't let them get away with it!! We want four more!! #MAGA2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jennajameson The electoral? 209-118. And it's not like most states are done. Nevada hasn't even started their results and he's about to win Arizona<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jennajameson I don't like bidens lead right now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madisongesiotto I dont like biden having this lead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gehrig38 What percentage do you give Trump to win this thing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joerussotweets @ChrisP11488 @MickGarrisPM  https://t.co/CUKhw7ijWD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joerussotweets @ChrisP11488 @MickGarrisPM That's it? That's all you have? My God, you liberals don't even try<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joerussotweets @ChrisP11488 @MickGarrisPM Yeah. Truth. What a motherfucker it can be<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joerussotweets @MickGarrisPM Maybe they're not cool with a guy who sniffs and gropes little children and can't form a complete sentence. Oh. And did you hear about him, his pedophile, crack smoking son, and Russia?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BostonStrong_34 No<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madisongesiotto I dont like that Trump is still losing the electoral though. Not great.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MichaelKeaton Can you imagine 4 more years of Biden publicly sniffling and groping little kids, with no repercussions?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BLABBERMOUTHNET The truth is, his own son knocked his ass out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BLABBERMOUTHNET  https://t.co/lpi6LixHwE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BLABBERMOUTHNET I am. His name is Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrTommyLand Oh look. News no one gives a fuck about<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston Never gonna happen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jemelehill @DAVIDprice24 Keep crying. Shits hilarious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanTown22 @Hodgebone @pack1980 @mlbtraderumors I completely agree. I'd much rather have Betts. But they have the money to offer Springer if they want. They clearly need another big bat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanTown22 @Hodgebone @pack1980 @mlbtraderumors They offered Betts over 300 mil<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JLester34 Sooooo Boston?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jared_Carrabis Jbj to Houston. Springer to Boston.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WEEI And thats why they've been elite for 20 years<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BauerOutage Disagree. And I don't wanna hear about 3rd time through the order bullshit either<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods They're asking for it. I'd happily give it to them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Loudwire Hahahahaha look at all the libs crying. Fucking hilarious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@akaDafni @MikeReiss Yeah I know. It's a pipe dream<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealSkipBayless I absolutely agree with this as a Pats fan. Belichick's ego is writing checks his ass can't cash. Brady was the winning formula. Not Bill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Patriots Absolutely fucking pathetic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dustinkensrue There is no such thing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Patriots Who is in at WR? I'm 6'4, 250. Want me to come play TE?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston Trade Gilmore and  multiple draft picks and Keene or Asiasi to San Francisco for Jimmy and Kittle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeReiss Doesn't even matter at this point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Patriots You guys gonna force Belichick to make a move for WR and TE, or we just gonna keep sucking the rest of the season? #SincerelyPatsNation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WEEI Should have let belichick walk, not brady<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston This is 99% on Belichick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston Yaaaaay. 3 points<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NivThis @MikeReiss Fuck that. I'd rather not win another game this season than have that POS on the team<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeReiss Trade draft picks, gilmore and whoever else to San Fran for Jimmy G and Kittle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Perrault Is Red Sox baseball almost back?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_ChrisCurtis @LouMerloni Fuck. That.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston He's not the answer. He's just not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WEEI This team fucking sucks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeReiss I was honestly excited for Cam. Really pumped. But he clearly is not it. I know he doesn't have receivers, and that's on belichick. He's too stubborn and it's costing his team. At this point, I'd either tank or try to get Jimmy G back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WEEI L incoming. Again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston This team sucks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KenDKM Is McGreevy's gonna re-open man?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sebastianbach @JoeBiden I love how you tweet literally the same shit numerous times a day, like it's gonna make a difference. It's gonna be so hilarious when Trump wins again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonSGress @deesnider Well if you mean being or voting Democrat, then no<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonSGress @deesnider Oh man. You got me. Moron.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@devildriver @evilriver @officialfye Killer album guys!! Really digging it!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ImDanaDeLorenzo As a Republican, I really like this. Just as I appreciated Biden tweeting out his well wishes. I had COVID in August, and it sucks for sure. Political views aside, let's just all get along and love each other<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Get well Mr. President. We love you, and our country needs you now more than ever #MAGA2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jerryjeudy Jordan didn't tweet this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HexSpar @philthatremains It's suspicious. The guy has been traveling all over the country for how long, been around how many people. This shit has been in the US since March, and he just gets it now? It doesn't matter. As long as he wins, and survives, I don't care<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@philthatremains Oh. He's gonna be fine. Funny how he got it right after the first debate and a month away from people voting<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden @sebastianbach He's actually denounced it multiple times. Maybe people in your corner should do their research before they whisper in your ear<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johncusack #MAGA2020LandslideVictory<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MMortemm He's a typical Hollywood asshole. Stopped following him like 2 years ago. It's pathetic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBCSBulls @bradmiska And some people think the guy who is 3-6 is better  https://t.co/m5qRg4S5Es<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mindykaling Trump literally said call them what you want and I'll denounce them. Then Biden said proud boys. So Trump then replied, "Proud boys stand down, stand by".... which means stop....don't fucking move. He literally denounced them. My God. Are peoples ears broken?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robreiner We? As in Republicans? Because Trump manhandled Biden #youreamoron<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenKing Decent man?! Hahahaha the fucking guy gropes and sniffs children. Then again, you're "in" with Hollywood, so you saying this doesn't surprise me<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ThatEricAlper Pretty much anything @CoreyTaylorRock did on the Iowa album<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyTaylorTalks As he shouldn't. If you can go to target, you can go vote in person. The idea of mail in ballots is bullshit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyTaylorTalks Democrats still crying about 2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston Biden refused to acknowledge that antifa is an organization<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@philthatremains I had it in August. It definitely sucked. But I don't think the country needs to be shut down for it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston Trump is the best #MAGA2020Landslide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston Maybe cause he's not hopped up on Adderall like Biden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnKerry Well. At least he knows what it's like to be president<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sebastianbach @JoeBiden I'm glad you feel that way, because I doubt he forms a complete sentence tonight. Also, do you care to comment on the declassified documents that were released today, stating Hillary set up the Trump/Russia hoax? No? Didn't think so.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@maxkellerman Right wingers, huh? Hilarious. I think you're mistaking them for those p*ssies in antifa, who are being bussed in by democrats, to loot and riot and run their Marxist organization. Just like most your sporting arguments, you're wrong on this too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jessicamreyes  https://t.co/ss5mGWrU5U<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoyTaylorTalks Bout time!! #throwtheirsorryassesinjail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston McDaniels is ass. All he calls is running plays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elizabethgyoung Gotta just take the FG goal there. No reason to get ballsy yet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SainttWolf @SavageBoston That I agree with. Cam needs time to mesh with these guys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BostonStrong_34 This game. Cause it's over<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SainttWolf @SavageBoston It's hard to bet against belichick. But Seattle is a better team, period. And I'm a pats fan. But thats just the truth. And with a new QB, and new plays...Seattle should win<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealSkipBayless How many times you gonna tweet the same shit, but worded differently?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston Pats had very little chance of winning this game to begin with<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SweetFeet_White Thoughts and prayers man. So sorry for your loss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyTaylorTalks You are. When it's not true. #truthhurts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyTaylorTalks Like kap? With that piece of trash che on his shirt, and pigs on his socks, with cop hats on?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@datduck11 @InaneGeek @Jared_Carrabis Easy on pabst<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sebastianbach @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris Because China is to blame for corona. Not Trump. #Idiot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkDuaneMorton @philthatremains Absolutely bro. All love on my end as well. Keep making the kick ass jams and I'll keep on listening 🤘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkDuaneMorton @philthatremains And I respect people who have different views than mine. Thats what makes us human. And I also know Trump doesn't always say the best thing or he tweets too much. I jus wish he wasnt bashed so much. He is the president after all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkDuaneMorton @philthatremains Look man. I dont wanna come off as a dick. I really don't. And I am a really big fan of yours. Truly. I love Ether. It's fantastic. And I wholeheartedly accept your apology. So thank you. The cool thing is, not everyone will have the same opinion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkDuaneMorton @philthatremains No one is talking about riding dicks. Just have some class and show some fucking respect. Like him or not. He's still YOUR president, whether you wanna own it or not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkDuaneMorton @philthatremains You got some real balls saying that shit to a veteran. My buddies were dying while you were out with your band, touring all over the world, figuring out how to get your singer out of a foreign prison. (Which btw wasn't his fault)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkDuaneMorton @philthatremains I didnt like Obama. But I didn't use my platform to bash his every move and call him names like a "bitch ass". And your platform has a larger audience than mine. But I dont know who the hell you think you are telling me maybe I shouldn't have served<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkDuaneMorton @philthatremains No one ever said, "Hey Mark. You're not American." I said if you dont support the president and the way the country is, then go. You're not a prisoner here. Trump is going to win again come Nov. So if you cant handle it, than I'm real sorry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkDuaneMorton @philthatremains Well I know one of us served in Marines and one didn't. So if you really wanna go there...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkDuaneMorton @philthatremains I hear Mexico is a nice country for Americans who are anti our president. #RedWave<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BillsAfterDark @RealSkipBayless People underestimate the celtics every year. Yet, they've been to East finals 3 times in 4 years. It's always Philly or Toronto or Milwaukee that get the love. People been sleeping on Boston too long<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@David28259105 @joedadd34781215 @RealSkipBayless It went 7 games cause of that lucky ass 3 Toronto hit at the buzzer. Dont get it twisted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joedadd34781215 @David28259105 @RealSkipBayless They dont need hall of famers. Did you not see their defense most of the Toronto series?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillsAfterDark @RealSkipBayless Celtics are better than Milwaukee. Clearly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyTaylorTalks Dolphins are a bunch of punk bitches<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@middlebrooks Because he's right, so he's lost?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheHerd @ColinCowherd Oh Jesus christ. As per usual, you're wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tocu98 @aarong723 @TomCaron Yes. Obviously I know whites kill whites. And Mexicans. And Asians. And African Americans. No race is superior to another. But let's not pretend that blacks don't kill each other in these ghetto ass cities, where gangs and drugs run rampant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelKeaton Jacob Blake had a warrant for raping a 15 year old. Rittenhouse killed a woman beater and a pedophile. Spare me the tears.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bennyjohnson @kate_awakening Have you ever heard a more tone deaf voice?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bennyjohnson @GerryCallahan And they wonder why their bitch asses are getting shot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frightrags Already ordered the hoodie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston It's also weird people are upset about a woman beater and pedophile being killed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aarong723 @TomCaron I agree 100% that there are police who are assholes and should be in jail themselves. But people need to stop pretending, black on black crime isn't a thing. The hate and killing need to stop, but it has to be a 2 way street. They need to stop it too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SethMacFarlane Let me guess. You feel bad for Jacob Blake too? Yeah. Let's feel bad for the pedophile. Makes sense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdwardNorton Yeah, it's a real shame he put down a woman beater and a pedophile. Fucking tragic. Jesus christ, get a grip<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@The_Warlock_86 @The19thHolePub @LundgaardK @TomCaron Can you not read?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomCaron I love Jim Rice and the Red Sox. But does he realize that it's not just blue lives killing black lives? What about the black lives that kill black lives?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShannonSharpe Yeah. Jacob Blake is a pos, convicted pedophile, who should have gotten more than 7 rounds. Kyle Rittenhouse protected himself against antifa thugs and showed people what happens when you play stupid games. You win the ultimate stupid prize<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ACLU @sebastianbach For what? For saying the truth? Don't jump and abuse people in the streets and you won't get shot. Simple rules.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AliceAldcroft 1, 3, 5. Any other answer is wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mens_Corner_ That man is a goddamn national treasure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SupGirl I'm not gonna lie. This is pretty fucking hilarious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@horrorfan2020 @Sweaving @Handlebrody @TylerGillett @BettinelliOlpin This is great!! I remember my return of the jedi vhs in the same cbs fox cover!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JR_Leonard88 @FieldYates And I'm also not saying there aren't cops out there that need to either be fired or put in jail themselves for abusing their power. Because there certainly are asshole cops out there, who have no business having a badge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JR_Leonard88 @FieldYates Oh I'm not saying the assumption of guilt isn't different. It sometimes no doubt is. All I'm saying is, when a cop says freeze, or stop, or slowly take your hands out of your pocket, then you just do it. And do it in a civilized fashion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JR_Leonard88 @FieldYates White has nothing to do with it. Just fucking listen and act civilized. My God. Where's the issue in that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JR_Leonard88 @FieldYates Can black people not hear now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JR_Leonard88 @FieldYates It's pretty cut and dry. Listen to cops. Don't reach for your pockets. Don't run to your car. Don't resist. Don't get shot. It's a very simple concept<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JR_Leonard88 @FieldYates Only black people are looting and rioting now? Did I say that? News to me?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JR_Leonard88 @FieldYates I dont give a shit if he wasnt a cop. It was a racist hate crime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JR_Leonard88 @FieldYates But no one major media outlet barely even spoke about that kid dying. Like I said, if races were reversed, it'd be front page news, and dont say different. As far as cops go, yeah some are definitely shit bags and need to be punished. But not all of them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JR_Leonard88 @FieldYates Where am I seeing this? I'm not. I'm not seeing any riots or looting or burning of business for a white kid who was murdered by a black man. Thats the point. I'm glad I'm not seeing that, because thats not the way you protest. Those people are animals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JR_Leonard88 @FieldYates Were a white guy that kid a black kid, thered be even more looting and more violence. People can't have it both ways. The shit needs to stop on both sides, but people can't just speak out when it's white on black. That's bullshit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JR_Leonard88 @FieldYates All that dude had to do was comply. You comply, you dont get shot. Especially nowadays with all this shit going on. You think cops are gonna feel safe with somebody going into their car after they tell them to stop? Really? And as far as the kid dying, if it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JR_Leonard88 @FieldYates Whatever you say<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hahahaha awesome<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston @neteamen22 Democrats are insane. Biden is a pedophile and he's their choice. Granted, Trump doesnt have the best way with words all the time, but Democrats are beyond salvageable. They're the ones who are truly insane<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ARKWalton @kenjeong So get the fuck out? Problem solved for you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ARKWalton @kenjeong Well. I saw Trump beat that bitch in 2016 for starters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ARKWalton @kenjeong See? That's what great about America. You can have your opinion and I can have mine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ARKWalton @kenjeong Ok keyboard warrior<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ARKWalton @kenjeong Cause he's a liberal and I'm not? So I'm smarter than him now? Also, just so you know, since you apparently know everything. A president has no choice when to go in a bunker. It's the secret services call<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ARKWalton @kenjeong Who the fuck ever said that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ARKWalton @kenjeong Per body here in Illinois. 100K deaths is bullshit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ARKWalton @kenjeong I'm sure that it is a real virus, that has damaging results to people with prior health conditions. That I believe. But 100K? No. If a guy goes to the hospital for a car crash and coughs before he dies, they mark it a corona death. Hospital are getting 14K<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ARKWalton @kenjeong Corona is a hoax. It's a man made virus from a Chinese lab. Trump had the economy booming before it hit, and the Democrats are so worried about getting him out of office, they'll do anything. Even kill Americans. Cause they dont give a shit about any of us<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ARKWalton @kenjeong So with all these protests and rioting, the numbers have gone up? Is that why CNN just had an article yesterday that NYC has seen no deaths and the corona numbers are down? Have you seen NYC in the past week?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ARKWalton @kenjeong It's not over 100K deaths. Not related to Corona anyways. Unemployment is high because of the hoax that is Corona. I agree the cops and racism both need to be put in check. But if you guys think Biden is the answer....I can't help you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kenjeong If by insane, you mean GOAT? Get ready for the next four years, pal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Loudwire @MotleyCrue @MrTommyLand Dudes a 57 year old white guy, who still colors his hair and facial hair, who also gets knocked out by his son. He's a joke<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@STR8Homah @philthatremains A judgment? Have you listened to nickelback before? Do you know who Metallica is? I mean, look, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, by all means. I just dont understand it I guess<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@philthatremains Not starting shit. Just honestly saying. Nickelback is a joke. Metallica are not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@philthatremains And I'd say it in person too. Nickelback is the kind of band that makes soccer moms wet. Metallica is the biggest hard rock band of all time. Not really sure how they compare<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ajgomesta @KristenClarkeJD @rolandsmartin @Patriots He got busted, got put in cuffs, Kraft found out why and kicked him off the roster. Pretty simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ajgomesta @KristenClarkeJD @rolandsmartin @Patriots Yeah, I'll clarify for you. He got arrested. They released him. What part aren't you comprehending? You think the front office or anyone on that team could control what he did off the field?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JuddApatow Coming from a Hollywood liberal? Insane? That's hilarious  https://t.co/40UzHN5Gz7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeReiss @animedpet @jesailer But if they think stidham is only a year or two away, why waste a pick on a QB this year?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarunaASMRtist I believe you 100%. Shit, there's some law enforcement and people in government agencies that are directly involved with it. Man, it's just a sick, sick world<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarunaASMRtist It definitely makes you hug your children a bit more tighter. It definitely makes me, as a father, be a bit more protective for sure. Hollywood is the worst. Apparently, this is all going to be exposed and we're all going to be shocked at the names involved<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarunaASMRtist Unfortunately, it's absolutely real. These people are sick, twisted fucks, who need to be exposed. They need to be taken down<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradleyWhitford @realDonaldTrump Doesn't it ever get tiresome crying and complaining all the time? Jesus christ, you liberals have been doing it since 2016. If you think Trump is happy or doesnt have compassion for the families, then you probably think Epstein killed himself too. Pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeReiss @patriotbomber Do you think they get hurts, love, or herbert?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sonsoftexas I am! Fucking love your band!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pgammo All I hear is you crying. Constantly. My God. Get over it. People like you are the same people who think Epstein actually killed himself<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LZZYHALE Hanging in there. How are you? Hope all is well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedSox The only correct answer is all. 04 broke the curse. 07 was second in only a few years. 13 because of the marathon and the beards. And 18 because of the 108 regular season wins. Phenomenal team. They're all so special. Boston is the absolute best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheHerd @getnickwright Honest question. No joke. How does nick wright have a job doing what he does? On national television? The guy is absolutely clueless. He's just a miniature rob parker or max kellerman. Sorry troll<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston He'll be better than Hoyer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston @Rooney013 There's absolutely no way in hell Belichick and Kraft lose Brady, then go into next season with Hoyer as their starting quarterback. Are you serious? They signed him to help Stidham learn the playbook and get accustomed to the running the offense #NewEra<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BradleyWhitford He's still getting re-elected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeReiss @caplannfl Cool. He'll be great as a tight end or wide receiver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kinky_horror I'm definitely pulling for him. I love that dude too much not to. Buuuuut I'm still a Pat's fan first and foremost<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kinky_horror I could have thrown up last night. Been watching Brady play in that uniform since the beginning. #Tampa #Gross<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston I hate my life, my stomach aches, the bile is building up. I fucking cried in the shower tonight. Cried.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston They have no quarterback. No receiving core. And no tight ends. Belichick is fucked. No more super bowl titles for a very, very, long time<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TomBrady Fucking kill me. Kill me now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston The patriots are making me nauseous by not adding any offensive weapons, and by not showing any interest publicly, or at least minimal publicly, about bringing back the greatest quarterback ever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston Be nice if he resigned his QB and got some guys on offense first<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RapSheet Jesus christ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Patriots Do something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KVN_03 Don't hit @TomBrady too hard when he resigns!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TomBrady The world is nuts right now. You busy? I was thinking maybe you could resign with the @Patriots soon. My anxiety level is already pretty high between Corona &amp; work. Help me out dude. Ease my mind a bit. Help me breathe. Ok, thanks bro. Appreciate it<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MrJonnyConCarne @MMnotine @LouMerloni Because he's not getting 420 mil from any team<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrJonnyConCarne @MMnotine @LouMerloni Yes. He absolutely would<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouMerloni Ok. So the dipshits in the front office need to make it happen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MMnotine @LouMerloni If he got paid between 375-390 million over 10 years....he's not saying no<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BostonStrong_34 I think we can all agree this front office is dumb as hell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouMerloni Why the hell is the front office still fucking around with this shit? Chaim screwed up. Bite the bullet, look foolish, whatever. At this point, JUST. KEEP. MOOKIE. MY GOD. Cut the years and raise the AAV<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cfad111 @stack1975 @MrMattson43 @benjah_min @LouMerloni Agreed. When you're the boston red sox, you dont have an opener. Then again, you should open the checkbook and sign mookie too. So who knows?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@klajoie316 @LouMerloni May or lux, not both, but one of them, would have been doable. And if not, then boston should have hung up right then<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stack1975 @cfad111 @MrMattson43 @benjah_min @LouMerloni They definitely need another starter if they lose price<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelChavis11 Wishing the front office pulls this bullshit trade off the table #KeepMookie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Perrault Pull. The. Trade. #FuckThis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scotty_Gee @alexspeier @ChrisCotillo @Ken_Rosenthal True. I dont know why I do that. You think I'd learn by now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrMattson43 @cfad111 @benjah_min @stack1975 @LouMerloni With who? There's no pitchers that are free agents that are better than price. The only one I'd even consider signing is colin mchugh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexspeier @ChrisCotillo @Ken_Rosenthal Just saw it's "not a certainty" it gets done. What in the actual fuck is going on? I'm so sick of this "trade." It's been a shit show from the start. Just pull the goddamn thing off the table already.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrMattson43 @stack1975 @LouMerloni But what do you do when JD is gone? They haven't locked devers up. Benny is very hit or miss. Verdugo seems to have a back issue. Mookie is the better option. He's the 2nd best player not named Trout. I agree with price though. I'm for getting rid of that $<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stack1975 @MrMattson43 @LouMerloni  https://t.co/ArS16zZ2y1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrMattson43 @stack1975 @LouMerloni Yeah, I get what you're saying. But mookie is better than harper<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jared_Carrabis @BostonStrong_34 Cancel. This. Motherfuckin. Trade.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stack1975 @LouMerloni Mookie Betts not being on the team doesnt make them better<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouMerloni Boston should have never done this without may or lux<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KevinStadnik @LouMerloni Pretty much what I was thinking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouMerloni Chances Boston resigns mookie this upcoming winter?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston But than a Yankees uniform<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BostonStrong_34  https://t.co/UqrE7hkUm2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jennajameson Keep doing you!! Happiness is all that matters!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mike_Dyer13 Yeah I agree somewhat. I feel he could have done better than what he has though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OverTheMonster @Mike_Dyer13 They are not gonna keep mookie after 2020. That's become clear. Trade him now and get major league ready talent and some prospects to replenish the farm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OverTheMonster @Mike_Dyer13 Not a fan of bloom. He hasn't done shit. Martin Perez? Ryder Jones? Austin Brice? Jeffrey Springs? Gonna trade mookie? Not gonna trade mookie? Christ man, do something worth a shit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MensHealthMag "Yeaaaaah. Like, drugs will do that."  https://t.co/xwk3k69seY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ByRobertMurray Bloom is really killing it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pack_sox @KevinStadnik @BostonStrong_34 Trout shouldn't have gotten that much either. These guys play a sport for christ's sake. One guy is worth almost half a billion dollars? No fucking way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevinStadnik @pack_sox @BostonStrong_34 420 million is ridiculous. Anyone with common sense knows that. Hence, why the sox front office didnt up their offer. I'd be happy with Springer. Him in center, benny in left and verdugo in right. Pretty damn good outfield<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJohnDennis That guy looks like a member of the sax players band, in the lost boys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pack_sox @KevinStadnik @BostonStrong_34 Because no athlete is worth that amount of years and money. They shouldn't offer top dollar. It'll handicap the team for years. You trade him now, get verdugo, and this upcoming winter, you sign Springer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pack_sox @KevinStadnik @BostonStrong_34 Because he's a very good player. But he certainly isn't worth 12 years and 420 million. If he wont stay for 10 and 300, then fine. But you trade him now so you actually get something in return. He obviously doesn't wanna be there for the long haul, so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston Unless it was in a super bowl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pack_sox @KevinStadnik @BostonStrong_34 I would think. I'm hoping for it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevinStadnik @BostonStrong_34 Get some prospects while you can. And if they can get verdugo, great. Kids got a shit ton of potential<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevinStadnik @BostonStrong_34 Screw that. Let him go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisCotillo Great. Now trade mookie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BostonStrong_34 When the fuck is this mookie trade happening<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Halestorm Hoping to see you guys at rock usa!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SurvivingGrady They need to announce this goddamn trade already and get it over with. It's ridiculous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Perrault Get it over with. Jesus christ. Stop dragging it out. I'm over it. Bye mookie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@barstoolsports I hate the chiefs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston Trade him now. I have no issue not giving him 12 years and 420 million<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dodgers Hurry up and give @RedSox verdugo, ferguson and downs for mookie. Announce it already. My God.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daxshepard @arnettwill @ArmchairExpPod I listened. Great episode. I used to live in Joliet. It's an awful shit hole.....but let's go to prison is a fucking hilarious movie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliciaETaylor I need to see @CoreyTaylorRock do this shit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MensHealthMag You forgot @TomBrady's hulu commercial<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheTweetOfGod  https://t.co/t0rHNf0Xmg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lana @DeenyMarie Staying right where he belongs!! #LFG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GerryCallahan How? This season is over. He's ready for week 1 of the 2020 season. What's the issue?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jemelehill Cool story....  https://t.co/GSrxnbVShP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DieLikeARichBoy @bradmiska I'm not bitter at all. The team I root for wasnt in it. But clearly you know nothing about the nfl and betting and Vegas, if you think that shit isn't rigged. I suppose you missed the blatant late hit on garoppolo too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bradmiska Refs won it. As they usually do, seeing as the NFL is in bed with vegas and vegas had kc winning it. Pretty pathetic actually. NFL is a joke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lana But it is. C'mon now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston Good. I'm ready for it. Give me verdugo and some prospects. Mookie doesn't wanna be in Boston for 10 years and 300 million? Bye. Get the fuck out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RapSheet Terrible game<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FieldYates  https://t.co/J4ObxYfM8b<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RMcElhenney Refs were the biggest part<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WTP_BDiehards Sadly, probably not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ColinCowherd I guess the refs missed the blatant late hit on Jimmy, huh? #Rigged<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NFLonFOX @nfl is really trying hard to let the chiefs win this thing #RiggedAsHell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMikeWilbon  https://t.co/VJXBmkgKku<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BostonStrong_34 Give me the dodgers offer<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jay_jaffe So this is you pretty much every other year?  https://t.co/JnToBNc0H2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jay_jaffe You sound fun<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peta @NFL @FOXSports Steak is delicious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@barstoolsports Best free agent signing.....until they re-sign @TomBrady<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanAshcroft_ You're pretty hard up for material, eh champ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LZZYHALE Sorry. I would love to be there, but I'm on my way to band practice 🤘🍻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stephenasmith @KattWilliams Apparently he's never seen @maxkellerman, nick wright or rob parker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lana Take care of yourself out there, Lana. Much love.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lana I completely agree. It doesnt matter how much money you have, or how many cars you have, or how big your house is. We all finish the same way in the end. Hopefully this helps people realize we need a little more love and compassion in the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lana It's really cool of you to reach out with such kind words. I think the death of Kobe kind of made a lot of people step back, me included, and say "Wow. Some things just aren't worth stressing about. Life really is too short." Again, thanks for the kind words<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BetteMidler Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bsports1997 @Jared_Carrabis Paying mookie 420 million over the next 12 years will handicap the team. You can't honestly tell me you think that's a good deal for the team in the long run<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@espn Kobe- As a @celtics fan, I loved you growing up. I even had your yellow #8 jersey, and those ugly ass Kobe 2 moon shoes haha. I couldnt help myself. I had to have your stuff. I loved and still love me some celtics, but there was something about you. #RIPMamba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NFLonFOX Any of the six @TomBrady has won<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SurvivingGrady  https://t.co/cTKkIr0oIu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomBrady Never leave New England bro<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bsports1997 @Jared_Carrabis Again. No athlete is worth 300 mil. Not ever. They play a kid's game for a living. While they are full of talent, and us as fans appreciate what they do...it's not worth that kind of money. They're not curing cancer or diabetes or aids or fighting in wars<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jared_Carrabis I love mookie. But he's not worth 300 million. No athlete is. Ever. Period.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mookiebetts I love you bro. Thanks for memories<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevinStadnik @LouMerloni He's a great player. But he's not Mike Trout<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevinStadnik @LouMerloni 10 years and 300 mil is beyond an adequate offer. Wake up. He wants to test free agency and see if he can get more. He wants to go to the highest bidder. They've been trying to sign him for 3 seasons. What are you not understanding?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouMerloni Just trade him already. He doesn't wanna be in Boston. It's becoming tiresome and I'm sick of hearing about it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jared_Carrabis Just make the damn trade already. Sick of hearing about it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I never get sick of @theofficenbc. Ever. Legit. Like never, ever. #comedygold<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FTFonFS1 @getnickwright Stop speaking. You're embarrassing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsjohnnybetts @ppnortonjr @SavageBoston Boston doesn't need Bryant. At all. Plus, he's overrated. He's defense is declining, he's injury prone, and he couldnt hit a breaking ball if you had a gun to his head. No thanks. Trade mookie, get the prospects now and sign Springer next winter<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoshuaR67635938 @BriBurkheiser @barstoolsports @AdelTWL If you think the nfl isn't rigged, then I'd hate to see your IQ test.

<|startoftext|>@coverme77 @TomCaron Brady will sign for league minimum before he let's his 20 year career in New England end with a goddamn pick 6<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@barstoolsports You really think Brady isnt coming back to the pats?! Hahahaha idiots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Patriots Kraft needs to be resigning @TomBrady tomorrow. He wasn't ever the issue. He threw for 4K yards with a bunch of scrubs and a rookie this season. Get him some guys to throw to. He's still playing at a high level. Still the best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston Disgusting. What a way to end.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@factsguy5 @RealSkipBayless Do you know how football works? Brady is a quarterback. That means he can't throw it and catch it himself. Just go on YouTube and type in "the quarterback position." Hopefully this helps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@f_fjay @SavageBoston I hope I'm wrong. I really hope I am. But it doesnt look like it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@f_fjay @SavageBoston I'm sorry. Did you not see the defense not only tonight, but the past 4 or so weeks? They've slacked. Hard. Do you even watch pats games? I guess you didnt see them run the same 3 plays at the goal line and only come away with 3 either<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BostonStrong_34 Game OVER<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston This game is......OVER<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BostonStrong_34 That's why they're losing<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoyTaylorTalks As a Pat's fan, I can realistically say, I'd be shocked I'd they win this one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BostonStrong_34 Defense is gonna cost the game<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nyylewis13 @JoezMcfLy Especially for it being 100+ mph<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nyylewis13 @JoezMcfLy True. But devers smacked the shit out of that ball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nyylewis13 @JoezMcfLy Film yourself doing it and tag me in it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomBrady Best. Ever. #LFG #NeverADoubt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoezMcfLy Yeeeeeah. But we all know he at least can<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DougKyed Well sanu cant catch apparently, so take him off the list<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoezMcfLy Nah. We have devers to hit bombs off of chapman<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenKing Yeah, that's not happening. It's cute liberals think it will though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonOrsillo God, I loved that team<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSlyStallone I need expendables 4 Sly!! Happy new year to you and the family!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ant_Writer @HamillHimself Jesus christ. Let dudes be dudes. It's ok to be a straight male. Buy a pickup, buy some guns, eat a steak, drink whiskey, build something, watch Eastwood movies, smoke a cigar, talk about hot chicks with your boys. Holy christ. It's ok.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmerleJustin Thank you sir!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealSkipBayless @undisputed  https://t.co/kesYHJObQq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@satavvibes @JoyTaylorTalks I'm rolling with them until Brady and Bill are gone. Then I'll have my suspicions. Miami gives them fits every single year. Unfortunately for us pats fans, today was not the day to lose to them. But it happened. Just gotta get ready for next week now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shipcity207 @JoyTaylorTalks This is true. By their standards, absolutely. But most NFL teams would kill to finish 12-4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thereallisaann @BovadaOfficial Happiness is when the pats dont choke away a fucking second seed. #Goddamnit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HenriKurs Not me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElitheSensei @SportsCenter No. Sorry that lebron winning that award is hilarious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston He's not going anywhere. He's not the problem. O line is hit or miss. Defense has been suspect lately. And god knows he has no one to throw to. He threw for 4k yards to a bunch of nobodies. He's not the problem. Relax.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dmonz21 @JoyTaylorTalks Last year? When they won the super bowl?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HenriKurs I didn't say they're going far. Not once. But you're wrong in that he wont be playing in new england next season. If they get him some goddamn receivers, he'll be fine. Guy threw for 4,000 yards this season to a bunch of nobodies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@evergreenLayne @marcmaron @WTFpod Hell yeah!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouMerloni Season is over. They may win next week, but that's it. They fucked up by releasing AB. Funny how he signed and all the shit came out, then he got cut and it all went away<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@satavvibes @JoyTaylorTalks I think it's alittle premature to start "doubting" the Pat's organization as a whole though. People can start doubting when Brady and Belichick are gone. I will say, bill completely mismanaged the clock today though. Kinda fucked them in the 1st half<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@satavvibes @JoyTaylorTalks Ravens sadly are taking the AFC anyways. Too young, too fast, actually have guys that lamar can throw the ball to. That always helps. Brady doesn't have that this year. And they had kc beat, but that td was called back, even though harry was clearly in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrittMcHenry Pat's weren't doing anything this year anyways. They're offense is atrocious. And I'm a Pat's fan, but that's the just the truth. They should have beaten the chiefs, but the ravens are better than them. Younger, faster, has receivers, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyTaylorTalks Dolphins definitely didnt quit. My hats off to them on that. But New England just played a very, very sloppy game. I do love you though. Happy holidays!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston 4. The whole fucking season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyTaylorTalks After one game? Really?  https://t.co/bWdbYQknfm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BleacherReport Pat's weren't doing this post season anyways. And I'm a Pat's fan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Patriots I love you, but you should be ashamed of yourselves right now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@giseleofficial @TomBrady I wish the organization would have given him some receivers for Christmas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston Belichick is an idiot for that clock management<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TedyBruschi @MiamiDolphins Pat's are pathetic this year. Period. Worst team Brady has had<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Perrault They dont deserve anything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston Over<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston Offense hasn't been trying all year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WEEI They're losing then too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Perrault They're not winning next week either<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston Losing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Perrault This team is straight ass. One and done come playoffs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcmaron @WTFpod You should get Jerry Cantrell or Robert Englund<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston This team is shit. This season is shit. Regardless if it's 2 seed or 3 seed, they're still gonna be one and done. That's what happens when you have no offense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattdolloff @985TheSportsHub #3 seed  https://t.co/g8rmBcBLRg<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EricBabich @ChrisSembower I didnt even say shit about a painting buddy. Read the conversation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisSembower Hey. I was just having a conversation about football and New England. A painting isn't going to ruin my night<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisSembower I mean, it doesnt bother me any. Brady and Co has beaten Mahomes and the boys twice before. Once in route to a super bowl. So, I'm good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisSembower Regular season wins are absolutely fine to celebrate. They dictate byes and seedings. Obviously you know that. But I do think teams should act like they've been there before. Like the old saying goes, "it dont mean a thing w/out the ring"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisSembower If they're true fans, they'll stick with the team. That's what real fans do. Doesn't matter who's the coach and who's the quarterback<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisSembower Clearly whoever the pair is, is not going to be better than Bill and Tom. But who's to say that "our world is gonna get small"? I think Pats fans will be the judge of that when that time comes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisSembower Oh? Is that true? So you apparently know what the rest of us don't? You must know who is gonna replace Belichick and Brady one day.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LouMerloni Yeah I see what you're saying. Is price getting traded you think?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston More importantly, who's on 1st? And by the way, the eovaldi signing was a huge mistake<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouMerloni Marco Hernandez? Lin?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@keeptheasp @ChrisCotillo Perfect analogy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RedSox So is anything gonna get done before these meetings end, or?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ajrivas @ChrisCotillo Yeah. It's annoying. Gotta spend to win<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jared_Carrabis Maybe you could tweet him and tell him either shit or get off the pot. Get under the tax or start signing some goddamn relievers. Maybe a starter.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hmmmmm. Well @NFL? You have a response? Yeah, probably not. #pathetic #andpeoplesaythepatscheat #yeahok<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BostonStrong_34 Sox waited too long. They're not concerned about winning in 2020. Clearly.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RedSox Anything Chris Sale, guys? Please. #GiftOfSox<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly. People are jealous as hell of the @Patriots and of @TomBrady. It's comical. After all the BS, and all the hating, don't think the boys aren't coming for #7 still. I'm talking to people like @maxkellerman<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jared_Carrabis I love how cole going to the yankees is a guaranteed world series win. Oh, wait a minute...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@passorfailwhat Without a doubt. It's a Christmas movie for sure. So is Die Hard 2. I think people overlook that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@getnickwright The @Patriots live rent free in your head, little man. It's hilarious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ColinCowherd TB12 needs help<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bradmiska You're wrong  https://t.co/C1upGRxo39<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brittanylynne8 Last time I looked, @Patriots still have a better record. Even with that loss the refs gave them last night<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brittanylynne8 Yeah. Your bf cant hold Brady's jock. If he lives in the real world, he'd even agree<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MichaelHelsel @sterling_short @josht3312 @ESPNNFL @Chiefs Are the Pat's not the 2 seed? Do you know something I dont jackass?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelHelsel @sterling_short @josht3312 @ESPNNFL @Chiefs Guess what? Pat's still got a better record<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sterling_short @MichaelHelsel @josht3312 @ESPNNFL @Chiefs He could have made it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@diannaESPN Funny how this came out today. Probably to try and take peoples minds off last nights bullshit officiating. It's just like regular media. Release one thing to take American minds off another. So, is all media scum bags, or? I'm guessing so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WEEI Hahahaha ok. Jerk offs. Try playing without the refs in your pocket next time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaShanneStokes @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/WEimUSdob9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RapSheet Investigate the fucking refs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston @diannaESPN Is the @nfl gonna investigate the bullshit refs from last night? Motherfuckers cost the pats a win. Not the time of the year to be pulling that shit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Perrault Should be @UnderArmour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomBrady You guys got screwed yesterday. Plain and simple. But as they say, "paybacks a bitch". #ComingFor7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sterling_short @MichaelHelsel @josht3312 @ESPNNFL @Chiefs Kelce? You mean the guy that fumbled, and the refs blew it dead?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelHelsel @sterling_short @josht3312 @ESPNNFL @Chiefs  https://t.co/FhPHuViFyn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WEEI Actually they should have won by 2 touchdowns, but ok<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston Probably lose that one too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KFCBarstool @TonyTodd54 How's your marriage?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MichaelHelsel @josht3312 @ESPNNFL @Chiefs Really? Did you watch the game?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ESPNNFL @Chiefs Too bad KC didnt get 2 tds taken off the board. Must be nice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WandyRied @ZAINRXJA @BleacherReport @brgridiron Do you even watch football?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BleacherReport @brgridiron Struggling? Did you dipshits watch the game? Do you know what refs are?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Patriots Yeah, I'm good. Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GerryCallahan Yep. So basically the Pat's are gonna lose<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyTaylorTalks Pat's are trying, but the refs wont let it happen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston Dont worry, they won't. This team just doesnt have "it" this year. And by "it", I mean any receivers. Except Jules<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HenriKurs Oh stfu<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AGuerreroTB12 @TomBrady @TheJasonKennedy @TB12sports Please keep helping TB12 the way you do. I definitely wanna see him play (on the patriots) until he's 45 #BESTEVER<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jared_Carrabis  https://t.co/zvdBOZTjQJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thereallisaann Do you think the @Patriots can still get to the super bowl? Do you think they're gonna get Brady any help?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SnoopDogg Damn bro. I'd be happy with 100 bucks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PMarizzle I mean....to a certain extent. I dont think people should go out and murder. But he made some good points. He just wanted to be loved. We all know that feeling  https://t.co/elzkKwQSXe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AB84 Come back to foxboro<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BostonStrong_34 Still no first baseman<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FS1 @WhitlockJason Your show sucks. They're still 10-2. And you all know how they play come January. Keep waiting and wishing though big boy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston And for nothing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Patriots Anytime you guys wanna bring back @AB84. We're all waiting. Funny how he was released, then all the sexual assault allegations stopped. 🤔. Resign this man, or #7 isn't happening this season. Simple as that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@espn What's hilarious is, it's the same old shit from you. The New England hate is always alive and well at espn. Let me know when they dont make playoffs. Again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BostonStrong_34 Go where? This game is still over<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Patriots Still losing guys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Patriots @Edelman11 @TomBrady Too little too late<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WEEI This team fucking blows. Worst 10-1 team ever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Patriots Get some real receivers for Tom. Then I'll believe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BostonStrong_34 Tom's the only one worth a fuck. Him and jules<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston They're not keeping the 1 seed. And with this team, they're not winning in Baltimore. And they're not gonna add anyone. So basically, this season is done<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston This team isn't doing shit this year<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ViktorGuil @espn @Patriots But they didn't win all 4. And Brady and the pats have always been the better team. Jackson is a great, young QB. But Baltimore wont win in New England, in January<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@espn What's hilarious is, you think the @Patriots are scared of the ravens. Pat's own the nfl. Baltimore doesn't stand a chance in Foxboro in January<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@elizabethgyoung I just can't believe how terrible they look offensively<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Perrault This offense is pathetic. They dont deserve to win<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Patriots Get. @TomBrady. Some. F'N. Receivers. NOW.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealSkipBayless That's cause @BumpNrunGilm0re is the best back in the game<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Michael_Fabiano Yeah, no<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KayceSmith They look awful offensively. Atrocious really<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston Points left off the board. Not a great first half offensively. Not really a shock these days though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SavageBoston Bring back @AB84<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BallizLyfe387 @RealSkipBayless @ShannonSharpe @TomBrady What does lebron have to do with brady?

<|startoftext|>@Wb76548 @RealSkipBayless @ShannonSharpe @TomBrady Yeah, hes not having his best year, but shannon consistently finds ways to rip on the guy. And I wouldnt say hes average. Even in a down year, hes still better than 98% of NFL quarterbacks. Shannon is salty as hell. He's pissed his career didnt last that long<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@starwars @EW @JohnBoyega Let me get that 2nd cover all day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealSkipBayless @ShannonSharpe is a @TomBrady hater. Always has been. He doesn't like him. Period. Shannon shouldn't even be allowed to utter the name of greatness from his mouth. They're 9-1 and TB12 is still king #comingfor7  https://t.co/VamntZqL0H<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elizabethgyoung I just find it funny that as soon as the Pat's cut him, all the rape news went away. The only thing ever mentioned about him was when he tweeted out some dumb shit. If innocent, the Pat's look like they could use him right about now, that's for sure<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FS1 @ShannonSharpe Yeah, I'll still take @TomBrady<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MrTommyLand Liberals make me laugh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact that #ImpeachTheMF is trending, regardless of your political beliefs, is absolutely pathetic and absurd. America should be ashamed. Especially if you're a liberal, who bashes Trump for "name calling" and "bullying."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TwitterMoments @TonyTodd54 Go ahead. Nothing is gonna happen. #keepcryingliberals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nflnetwork @ChicagoBears @KyleBrandt @gmfb  https://t.co/JOimHMrJ9u<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FS1 @ClayTravis Nobody is @TomBrady except Brady. Don't ever compare the two. Pure blasphemy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thereallisaann @SiriusXMFantasy Kenny Golladay fucked me. I lost cause of that bum<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WEEI We're on to Michael Crabtree<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dodo This woman is an angel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GerryCallahan Absolutely disgusting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ItsRachelHolt Finally! Something good in this world! #thatsmile<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NESN Does anyone care what Jemele thinks? No? Yeah, I didn't think so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohhhh boy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FirstTake Stay off the weed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MatthewBerryTMR George Kittle is getting dropped<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matt_mullin Keep hating. We love it!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WEEI It's time for gostkowski to go<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AB84 You'll live. Try not having money in the bank<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thereallisaann @BovadaOfficial @cofieldandco @ESPNLasVegas How many points do the pats beat the jets by sunday?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thereallisaann @BovadaOfficial George Kittle or Darren Waller this weekend, Lisa? Kittle has killed me to start the season, but he's projected higher<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bspeed24 @SamDosty_5 @PeteAbe @tonylapp They, like us fans, knew without Sale and bullpen help, they weren't going anywhere but home come October<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bspeed24 @SamDosty_5 @PeteAbe @tonylapp Look. I just wanted to see a little more fight, that's all. To me, they look like they're just waiting for the season to end, so they can get a little time off before they start their winter workouts. I mean, let's be honest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_ChrisCurtis @MutWEEI Good. Go to @UnderArmour. They're better anyways<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteAbe @tonylapp You may wanna get your eyes checked. Cause it's abundantly clear by just watching. Apparently you can't see that well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamDosty_5 @bspeed24 @PeteAbe @tonylapp Oh I completely agree. But does no one think that's a problem?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FS1 @getnickwright  https://t.co/Kf9Oy3LxEi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bspeed24 @PeteAbe @tonylapp Well yeah, jbj isnt gonna just stand there and watch  a ball go over his head. They look lifeless at the plate and the pitching is awful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thereallisaann What are your thoughts about starting George Kittle this weekend over Darren Waller? Yes or no? Kittle has really been pissing me off. But he's projected higher Sunday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteAbe @tonylapp Give me a break. Wake up. These guys get paid millions of dollars to play a game. They knew good and well that without their ace, they had no shot of catching up in the wild card race. These guys have looked dead the past month. Way too inconsistent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteAbe @tonylapp Yes they did. They realized, like all of us, with no Sale, a taxed pen, and already being behind in the standings, they had no real shot of doing anything. They need to be concerned about keeping mookie right now. This season was over by early August<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@undisputed @RealSkipBayless Damn right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealSkipBayless @undisputed Wow. Are you guys serious with this garbage?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jennajameson Unbelievable. Rich really do get richer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobZombie Going in an hour!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Flyguy2stackz @MarketBasket @ProcterGamble @SweetFeet_White Got you in my lineup this weekend bro!! Kill it for me!! #PatsNation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LZZYHALE @godsmack_music @Monster_Truck_ @SullyErna I wanna hop on a tour with you guys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MatthewBerryTMR Nick Chubb or Sony Michel in my flex position this weekend? Matt Ryan or Russell Wilson?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RapSheet  https://t.co/7y40UfGnej<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chrisgronkowski Morning Chris! Have a great day man!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ColinCowherd  https://t.co/1r6wKTZ1Yw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealSkipBayless @undisputed Somebody drug test @ShannonSharpe. Did he forget about a God named @TomBrady?<|endoftext|>
