<|startoftext|>@IanBartholome13 I’m more shocked how Aliya can get knocked out by a tin of money, kicked in the ribs and still climb on the roof without a mark on her or no sign of concussion 🤔  I said to my son if I saw Jeff in the street he’d scare the life out of me  my sons reply- Proves he’s a good actor<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So Shane Ritchie’s son Shane Jnr thinks it ok to come on Twitter slagging off other celebrities in the castle, but anyone dare say anything about his dad and he doesn’t like it  I pointed this out to him so he blocked me 🤣 What a condescending, arrogant little prick he is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RJWood86 @iamshanenolan Haha he’s completely proved our point Becky  he’s blocked me 🤣 He can give it but can’t take it 🙄 x<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@susannareid100 Even more sad that people are going on protests today without showing an ounce of respect for our veterans x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Colpodifulmine7 @celebliverpool @LivEchonews 🤣🤣🤣👏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@easyretireiii @MrD_ESC @KatrinasWeb My guess would be of Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LivEchonews Omg can’t believe the comments on here 🤦‍♀️  Next you’ll all be saying “ I’m not racist but......<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@monkey_limping @SandraWeeden @SallyPresto Well yesterday wasn’t the weekend and I walked past one of the testing  stations on my way to work and the only people that was there was the army<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Us scousers are so proud of you @MarcusRashford  Thank You! 💙<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What annoys me is the name calling when someone has a different opinion over covid  People getting called sheep and nobheads  If you want a test get one if you don’t then don’t  Don’t worry what ‘Betty from Bristol’ or ‘Tom off Twitter’ is doing just worry about ya self<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllattBarbara @Stacey2018x @ChristianHay8 @SkyNews Sending ballot papers in dead people’s names ??? Can’t wait to see the evidence of this 🤦‍♀️  Just typical of something Trump and his minions would come out with 🤦‍♀️🤣🤣 He’s an embarrassment and he’s turned your country into a laughing stock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndiaWilloughby How can anyone take Trumps court threats seriously when he already said he was gonna do this weeks ago before voting even began!  He’s just a spoilt brat who can’t accept not getting his own way  Would love to see his evidence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JLivingstonSe1 @IndiaWilloughby I agree with you about Biden  but I think he’s the best of a bad pair  Trump is absolutely vile<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@freakyzulu @IndiaWilloughby I third that 👍 x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SSSmith3421 @Stacey2018x @ChristianHay8 @SkyNews Where’s the evidence? 🤷‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@suexsue73 @KarenSquires18 @Stacey2018x @ChristianHay8 @SkyNews Exactly this 👏   He needs to accept he’s lost, move on and stop embarrassing himself!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllattBarbara @Stacey2018x @ChristianHay8 @SkyNews Who told you that ? Trump ? 😆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“I WON BY LOTS”  Waaaaaah  😆  https://t.co/t0UcMZfs5b<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SouthernMrsOwen  https://t.co/DODH8ZAnS9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The president’s men had a witness.....    oh please 🤦‍♀️  Wonder how much they paid her for that little saga 🤷‍♀️  Embarrassing!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And all this time I thought Boris was a 🤡  but all this carry on in America make him look half normal!! 🤷‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Swift4Neil @LivEchonews Yes it is  but this one brought all this on herself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AgentMRM @LivEchonews 🤣🤣🤣👏👏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eduardocafo @ladyharley883 @piersmorgan My standards must be on the floor  I think he’s hilarious 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just about sums him up 🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ccole_99 Nice to see you back Cameron  Hope your doing ok xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember growing up and there was always that one spoilt kid who always got their own way, got everything they wanted and if things didn’t go their way they’d throw a tantrum and start stamping their feet ?    Yes #Trump that kid is you!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When your happy you enjoy the music,                                                               When your sad you understand the lyrics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funny how it’s only the places that aren’t voting for Trump that are voting fraudulently 😏😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Haha Teresa May with a cap on 😆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@efleforte @IndiaWilloughby Eileen I 100% agree with everything you say 👏 xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NikoLaimic @IndiaWilloughby It’s kind of dangerous too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndiaWilloughby Really don’t know how people think he’s funny!  There’s nothing funny about a homophobic racist who wouldn’t know how to tell the truth if his life depended on it  He’s a dangerous manipulating narcissist!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Janela_X So she’s offensive for calling Ben Bradley our on his disgusting tweet?  If your ok with that tweet your just as disgusting as he is!!  Seems like you’d be happy to see underprivileged kids go without!!  Your the offensive one!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Danielfoy11 @Janela_X But they don’t get money they get vouchers,  nice try tho 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mitchjt91 @Janela_X Exactly!!  Ive just read her tweet 3 times to try and find the offensive bit! 🤷‍♀️ I think she’s spot on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Supported labour all my life but don’t, and never will trust @Keir_Starmer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When someone says “I’m not racist but”........      That’s when you know they’re racist!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Definition of Twitter...    Perfect platform for gobshites to troll and insult people all they want because they know they’d never have the balls to say it to ya face 🤷‍♀️🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Marjoleinnnn Happy Birthday Marj  Enjoy your day 🎉🎉🎉🎂🍷 xx<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CaroleBarber20 @piersmorgan @MarcusRashford Why doesn’t Boris and his pals all donate a week of theres ?  Maybe if they did their job Marcus Rashford wouldn’t have to do it for them!!  And while we’re on the subject, how much have you donated Carole??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WatchedToffee @oxoking @piersmorgan @MarcusRashford Ooh the irony 🤦‍♀️  Steve’s made himself look a complete twat!! 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TimDownie1 @FelicityBuchan It’s like being back in the Thatcher days!  She took away free school milk, now this lot are putting the final nail in the coffin!!  Just remember, kids of today are the voters of the future.... something to think about @FelicityBuchan<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Today we got the news my husband is cancer free! 🙏❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dan9700 We’ll have to agree to disagree   Trump is nothing but a vile corrupt lying homophobic racist!!  Not saying Biden is much better but in my opinion he’s the best of a bad bunch!!  Sorry Daniel 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As usual it’s turning into the Trump show!!  Aren’t the mute buttons working ? #USElections<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scousebird77 @TheVampsband Aww brilliant Charlotte x<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@blueeyedbaby34 It’s all madness!!! I work in a secondary school and all we’ve got in at the minute is year 8 and 9  all the other years have been sent home to isolate!  There’s more staff in than kids 🤦‍♀️ Hope your little one is ok x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LivEchonews Although I’m happy the gyms are getting opened back up  I don’t think this fella should get his fine back as he shouldn’t of been open when he was<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@terrymcallister @LivEchonews 🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkHar87157675 @KBainbridge79 @Walter__2020 @LivEchonews Oh right so because YOU don’t fall in any of  those categories let’s open everything back up!!  So long as your ok lets just put a middle finger up to the vulnerable and crack on  Your attitude is beyond selfish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaysoyham Unfortunately there will always be trolls  who’s only enjoyment in life is bringing others down, must make them feel better about themselves xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Andyjohno88 @LivEchonews I suppose that depends on what gym you go to<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndiaWilloughby Agree  It’s nothing but a shit show x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@calconnor66 @bigm1718 @LivEchonews That’s true<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigm1718 @calconnor66 @LivEchonews To be fair Maria you have got a point!!  A lot of labour supporters in Liverpool did vote Tory because of Corbyn and put us all in this shit storm we’re in now  Personally I thought corbyn was a legend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cappadiszle @piersmorgan This is heartbreaking 😔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyBurnhamGM   What a legend! 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got to say @PaddyMcGuinness really suits his hair grey  Looks well better<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Put ‘The Greatest Showman’ on for the kids, they lost interest an hour ago while I’m still sitting engrossed!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DickTur00245076 @Dad_will_fix_it @LivEchonews Exactly!  Then probably blame the NHS for it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@twinski Thank you 😘  Yes we are, He had to have a biopsy on Wednesday to see how bad it is  just waiting on the results now which is a nightmare! x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DickTur00245076 @Dad_will_fix_it @LivEchonews My hubby got the all clear in jan but got told he had to keep having treatment for 3 yrs or it would return as it was highly aggressive They stopped his treatment in March till sept due to lockdown, he got told last week after a scan the cancers back!! Then you see these twats!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Toffeewolfie @LivEchonews Exactly!!  Why did the police stand there and allow this to go ahead ?  But they’ll pull you up if you come out of Tesco without a mask on 🤷‍♀️ ( they did it to my daughter but she’s  exempt)  Doesn’t make sense!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoyAndrew6 @Swift4Neil @LivEchonews Exact this 👆  well said Roy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@patashley56 @LivEchonews Bad shout that pat, where do ya think ya are, the match? Was the whole of Liverpool at this rally? No thought not!! Cos apart from these few gobshites no one in the city condones their selfish actions!! So run along and come back when you know what ya talking about<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LivEchonews Condolences to all the family 🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dan9700 Condolences to the poor teachers family,  This is heartbreaking, not to mention barbaric!!  RIP sir x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndiaWilloughby No it’s not right India, it’s disgusting!  People should concentrate more  on their own lives and leave others to live theirs in peace!  Your a beautiful woman and don’t let anyone tell you different!! Xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmHUAL Try sudocrem x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Severia75766425 @LivEchonews 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👏👏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wotwitwotwotwow @GreenH11 @parkdupark @spencermorgan93 I totally agree, I don’t know why they didn’t use those nightingale hubs they created all over the country for covid patients and use the hospitals as normal  And thank you, he’s just got to wait for his results now🤞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillKazno1 @GreenH11 @parkdupark @spencermorgan93 He had to go for a covid test on Sunday as his appointment was Wednesday ( yesterday)  they phoned him Tuesday to say it was negative and he was ok to go in the next day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoonieCFC Hope everything goes well for your dad Manon and it’s not bad news🤞 Sending love positive thoughts xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaggymccann197 @LivEchonews Definitely  The way I see it is because Liverpool is a predominantly labour city the gov are using us as their Guinea pigs cos they know come elections they’ve got nothing to lose anyway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PlasFron @LivEchonews Perhaps,  if the students hadn’t have run amok last night we wouldn’t be having this conversation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaggymccann197 @LivEchonews Been saying this,   It’s getting like the thatcher days all over again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amos04422340 @GreenH11 @parkdupark @spencermorgan93 Thank you Amos 👏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bellaspaniel @Davidbody4 @piersmorgan The media love to stir up a bit of scouse bashing, never been any different x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thepublocal @GreenH11 @parkdupark @spencermorgan93 No offence taken  just don’t understand why your lost!  I’m lost at why you think medical staff would be lied to about how many covid patients they have 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeniRoberts8 @Davidbody4 @piersmorgan You’ve hit the nail on the head 👏  They were students<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bellaspaniel @Davidbody4 @piersmorgan They were students  my lad does security in town, this was concert square he said there wasn’t a scouse accent amongst them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan My son does night security in town   This was just one small area ( concert square) the rest of town was relatively empty  He said they were out of town students as there wasn’t a scouse accent amongst them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GreenH11 @parkdupark @spencermorgan93 I think the problem here is you don’t want to believe anything other than what you want to believe  your making every excuse in the book,  even accusing medical staff of being in on some sort of conspiracy 🤦‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GreenH11 @parkdupark @spencermorgan93 Can’t see any reason why they’d be given false information,  and as they work there on a daily basis they’re  obviously seeing for themselves what’s going on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GreenH11 @parkdupark @spencermorgan93 My husband was at Aintree hospital today to have a biopsy for suspected cancer  He was kept in a bubble after surgery then sent home as soon as,  The nurses told him the hospitals full of covid patients so they  want other patients in and out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@callumw89 True words 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LivEchonews @LivEchonews making out this was happening in the whole of city centre  It was Concert Square, one small area of town!!  I’m not saying it was right but stop trying to escalate it into something it wasn’t  My lad works nights in town and he said everywhere else was quiet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@moonmelon1 @LivEchonews Wouldn’t even be arsed trying to explain anything to this fella  It would be like talking to a monkey  Oh wait....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@celebliverpool @LivEchonews It looked more like a rat to me  Looked too big to be a mouse<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@johnjonesgggg @piersmorgan Exactly this 👏👏👏  Been saying this for days<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@watson17242 @FussCreativeUK @piersmorgan The fact that he used the trip to test his ability to drive after suffering loss of vision with his wife and child in the car is incompetence on its own!!  Why would anyone put their family’s lives in danger like that, he’s lucky he didn’t kill them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarnettLD @piersmorgan Maybe because cancer isn’t contagious,  neither is being an alcoholic or crashing your car!!  It’s seems to me so long as your ok and those close to you  you couldn’t care less about the effects your actions could be potentially having on anyone else  So selfish!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MICHELLEJDUDA I was just gonna say  it A to Z  Then it starts aa to zz  glad you got your money back and got the ones you wanted  We fell for that years ago at an X factor tour  thought aa was front row and ended up needing binoculars 🤣 xx<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Joannew31 @GaryBarlow Defo  miss my boys and miss you girls 😊 xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joannew31 @GaryBarlow Oh Joanne this is getting exciting now 😊  Just hope he doesn’t announce a tour before pay day 🤦‍♀️🤣🤣 xxx<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IndiaWilloughby Wow!!!!  Any need for the nastiness!!!  Another attention seeking keyboard crank who wouldn’t say shit to your face xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bekijo1 @juniordrblog @andyjenk1 Think I’ve told you before I saw you at Delemere forest sitting outside the cafe with Emma and Lisa  Me and my mates were on another table I would have come over then but I’d had a bit of an argument with Lisa at fusion so felt a bit awkward 🤦‍♀️🤣🤣 xxx<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@callumw89 Oops sorry   I was talking to me mate Aaron and posted on yours by mistake as his tweet was underneath yours 🤦‍♀️  Feel a right twat now 🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@votelabourgets1 @flowesaunders68 @lucyallan @BorisJohnson 👏👏👏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fieact1 @hjco17 @flowesaunders68 @lucyallan @BorisJohnson So what about the cancer patients who’ve had their life saving treatment cancelled ?  My husband being one of them!!  He’s now potentially been handed a death sentence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mars1Lisa @lucyallan @BorisJohnson Totally agree  between him and Hancock I can’t decide who’s the bigger embarrassment!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lucyallan @BorisJohnson You disagree that the collective health of the nation is at risk ??  What about the cancer sufferers who are having their treatment put on hold/cancelled ?  I’d say their health is very much at risk!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@callumw89 Hope your ok Aaron xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christine6257 @BorisJohnson He’s embarrassing 🤦‍♀️ xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndiaWilloughby To be fair India  this has been doing the rounds for a couple of years now  Saw it loads on Facebook   Still funny tho 🤦‍♀️🤣🤣  #Shameless xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bekijo1 @juniordrblog @andyjenk1 The problem with me mum is she’s not an attention seeker she’s just dead gabby🤣  She gabs to anyone and everyone who cares to listen so she’s probably had them up the wall  🤦‍♀️🤣 but that’s a typical pensioner, they should know that xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bekijo1 @willintyne @pleased2bme @juniordrblog @andyjenk1 Realising I was standing behind her  I said what was that love?  She shit herself when she turned round seen me  I absolutely wiped the floor with her xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bekijo1 @willintyne @pleased2bme @juniordrblog @andyjenk1 I remember when my mum was in there having a knee replacement a few years ago  On the day she was going home I overheard one of the nurses at the nurses station saying Thank god that attention seeking arl witch is going home  the other nurse said who  then she said Pat  not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bekijo1 @willintyne @pleased2bme @juniordrblog @andyjenk1 I know what you mean Bek  I used to be a domestic in Aintree Hospital  The majority were lovely but there was the small minority who spoke to me and looked at me like I’d fell off their shoe  I noticed the higher up the ladder they were the worse their attitude towards me was xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bekijo1 @willintyne @pleased2bme @juniordrblog @andyjenk1 It’s fine Bek  I tried to comment back to her but she’s blocked me for whatever reason 🤷‍♀️🙄  Obviously she doesn’t like being proved wrong little miss know all xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willintyne @Bekijo1 @pleased2bme @juniordrblog @andyjenk1 I’m heartbroken for you and your wife  this is such sad news It’s just the most horrible time  Sending you positive thoughts and I really hope all goes well 🙏 xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willintyne @Bekijo1 @pleased2bme @juniordrblog @andyjenk1 Then they’d know more and phone him straight away on the same day They still haven’t phoned, he’s tried phoning them but can’t get through so he’s left in limbo with a potential death sentence hanging over him  We’re in the North West<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willintyne @Bekijo1 @pleased2bme @juniordrblog @andyjenk1 He went for a scan 2 weeks ago to be told it’s returned, he was waiting for an appt to go in for surgery and got a phone call Friday to say it looks like they’re closing the theatres so his treatment would not go ahead they said they were holding a meeting Monday ( yesterday )<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willintyne @Bekijo1 @pleased2bme @juniordrblog @andyjenk1 My husband got diagnosed with bladder cancer last year, early this year he got the all clear but got told he had to have treatment for 3 years as it was highly aggressive and would return, they stopped his treatment in March due to Covid so he had no treatment for 6 months<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nick4125 @Johnnysmalls78 @Cattnipper @piersmorgan Not really no!!  My husband has just had his cancer treatment cancelled due to all this going on so I’ve got more important things to worry about!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoannaLemarine1 @thebandit33 @jc_coates @piersmorgan Sorry for your loss 🙏 xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bekijo1 😘😘😘😘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bekijo1 I’ll message you as soon as we know anything x And thank you so much for caring 😘😘 xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bekijo1 We’re just really scared what their decision is gonna be, if they say they’re not treating him then they’ll just be handing him a death  sentence, he’s not holding his breath tho he said he could tell by her voice on the phone that it  wasn’t the looking hopeful 😢😢 xxxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bekijo1 Common sense would have been to use the  nightingale and the old g mex for the Covid patients as they were fully equipped ready to use but never got used  And use the hospitals as normal Just don’t understand why they didn’t do this, it doesn’t make sense to me xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bekijo1 It’s awful  My daughter said if they stop his treatment she’s gonna contact the Liverpool Echo for him and all the others going through the same thing as it seems to be happening across the board and it needs to be highlighted it’s so wrong 😢 xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bekijo1 Hi Beki x  Nobody phoned him 😢  So if no one phones in the morning he’s gonna phone them, so we should know more then! can’t believe they’ve just left him dangling  His head is battered 😢Thank you so much for messaging me to ask about him  I really appreciate it 😘😘 xxxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@medusainsummer @Adrian_Baggott @piersmorgan @GMB Totally agree x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeBotherd @Rob15456267 @piersmorgan @WestwoodLee 🤣🤣🤣👏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adrian_Baggott @piersmorgan @GMB Serious question that I’d love to know the answer to  Who’s to blame for all the cancer patients getting their treatment stopped and potentially left to die is it NHS or the government? Can someone please enlighten me?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikebatson5d @Political_JJ That’s so true x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scousericey Heartbreaking  RIP Jacob 🙏🙏🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikebatson5d @Political_JJ Thank you so much, and same to you all  ❤️ It’s absolutely disgusting the way so many people are getting neglected  It’s inhumane and immoral when it all could have been avoided 😢 xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikebatson5d @Political_JJ So sorry to read this, my husbands cancer has just returned due to treatment getting cancelled  Now they’re saying they’re closing the theatres in our hospital so his life saving operation is about to be cancelled<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christine6257 @BorisJohnson Me too 😢  I had 7 concerts postponed this year till next year,  the way things are going I can see them all getting cancelled completely x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@callumw89 Sounds like she likes you and she’s trying to get you jealous 🤷‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Johnnysmalls78 @Cattnipper @piersmorgan I totally get what your saying and I can only imagine how scary it would be bring the army in but  if it’s the only way to get some people to listen instead of doing what they like and not taking this serious then so be it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bekijo1 @DesmondSwayne 😘😘😘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bekijo1 @DesmondSwayne Aww thank you Beki  I’ll let you know on here what they say  I’ve got you on Facebook ( Michelle Gavan ) but he doesn’t want me putting anything on there cos I’ve got a lot of his family on there and he doesn’t want to worry them just yet xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndiaWilloughby Thank you India x  Just feel like he’s been handed a death sentence xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bekijo1 @DesmondSwayne We’ll know more Monday when they phone him back  They phoned him today to explain the situation and said they were having a meeting Monday morning on what to do but he my hubby said he could tell by her voice they’ve already made a decision xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bekijo1 @DesmondSwayne He was meant to go for a biopsy next week to see how bad it is but they’ve cancelled  we feel like he’s been given a death sentence 😭 xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bekijo1 @DesmondSwayne Thanks Beki He got the all clear earlier in the year but due to it being highly aggressive they said he still had to have treatment for 3 years to stop it returning!  They cancelled his treatment for 6 months due to lockdown Now it’s returned and they’re closing the theatres 😢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bekijo1 @DesmondSwayne I’ve lost faith in all of it after the news we’ve had today  Thanks to this new lockdown they’re closing the theatres in our local hospital, my hubby has Grade 3 highly aggressive cancer and without his treatment which they’ve postponed he will die 😢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@msm4rsh As if 2020 could be that Pure and Simple 😜<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndiaWilloughby Theatres so his treatment will get postponed  How can they do this?  This is immoral  and surely illegal  without treatment my husband will die as its grade 3 highly aggressive  so to neglect cancer patients is potentially murder xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndiaWilloughby And where does that leave the cancer patients ?  My hubby’s just been told his bladder cancer has returned, secondary  Waiting to go in for a biopsy to see how bad it is and has been told today by the hospital that they’re having a meeting on Monday to decide wether to close the<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Had 6 gigs to attend this year 3 of which have been postponed, no doubt the other 3 will be also   I am disappointed, not so much about the gigs but about the whole situation in general!!  Waiting till next year is fine, it won’t kill me, whereas attending them now easily could<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@claudinecollins @piersmorgan @RishiSunak @GMB Seriously??  @piersmorgan is the only one fighting our corner and saying it how it is, not like the other bunch of clowns hiding behind a smokescreen ( or in a fridge )  We’re all sick of the constant lies and cover ups<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@smp5719 @JJBergkamp10 @piersmorgan Yeah and.. I get what your doing digging up old news to make @piersmorgan look like the racist but 2 wrongs don’t make a right does it   And don’t ever put me in the same sentence as that vile piece of shit @KTHopkins  I’d sooner gauge me own eyeballs out than applaud that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smp5719 @JJBergkamp10 @piersmorgan This was from January<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We’re getting a new puppy in a few weeks, a girl  Half sharpei and half french bulldog   The problem is we can’t come up with a name for her that we all agree on   Any suggestions? X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@suecanadine @ACanadine 💔💔💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scousericey It was similar outside the Royal ( Liverpool ) last night too  All the nhs workers/ nurses standing shoulder to shoulder clapping  then they’ll go back in to their own wards probably all in different parts of the hospital 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MICHELLEJDUDA @LettiMcTweet Was the same here outside The Liverpool Royal Hospital   Hundreds all standing outside clapping 🙄  Police too!!  Probably the same police who’d stop us in the street for going the shop xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkBorkowski @ElaineD32375493 @piersmorgan @piersmorgan for PM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BertieSrn50337 @GOVUK My husband has bladder cancer, he was due his next round of treatment next week which has now been cancelled and no new date has been given 😔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>People in the supermarket pushing a trolley round wearing latex gloves, then picking food up still wearing said gloves that have been all over the handle of the trolley  Can you see were I’m going with this.....  🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sainsburys I am a regular customer at your Rice Lane L,pool store I arrived tonight at 7.35pm to find the doors locked and the guard refused me entry Opening times clearly states 8am to 8pm so to be refused entry 25mins early is false advertisement I’m annoyed to say the least<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bekijo1 @GaryBarlow Seen his true colours a couple of years ago after the way he spoke to one of my friends xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bekijo1 @GaryBarlow Beki I saw that last night   Shocked Is an understatement 😳   Seems certain people think they’re bigger than they actually are xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rachelwills76 @ChristyG_Journo @IndiaWilloughby Exactly!!    Wonder do they realise if the little girl gets it and has to be admitted to hospital she’ll be completely on her own   Some people aren’t fit to breed<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@killen_killer @scousebird77 @piersmorgan @GMB Listen  I can’t stand the man  but it wasn’t him personally who hacked the phone   Read up on it  he’s guilty by association for working for that awful paper at the time  but that still doesn’t justify calling her retarded  she’s far from it !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lovely reading about the girl giving birth at anfield last night whilst watching Pink  She’s named her baby Dolly Pink after her idol  Personally I’d have gone for Alicia Pink as Alicia is Pinks name but each to there own<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@killen_killer @scousebird77 @piersmorgan @GMB So because she has a different opinion to you that makes her retarded ???  She mightn’t agree with you but she’d never resort to personal insults as she respects other people’s opinions so that comment says more about the type of person you are than her !! Vile thing to say !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoonieCFC Don’t know what’s happened but just ignore them manon  there’ll always be jealous dickheads around xx<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bekijo1 I used to ignore her but one day she said something on the lines of all gays should be shot  That’s when I kicked off. My Ryan has trouble dealing with the fact that he’s gay anyway so the last thing I wanna see is some dickhead wishing death on him  Shes  obsessed with it xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bekijo1 I had murder with her on here last year over her homophobic rants then she blocked me. As the mother of a gay son some of the shite she come out with was beyond hurtful  I actually think she needs help,  her thought process isn’t normal  Vile nasty bitch 😡 xx<|endoftext|>

But then I got on it she was mates with Alison Brown so that says it all 🙄. Alison had blocked me cos I’d had murder with her over her homophobic rants 😂xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emmalou25 @KellyBarlow98 Oh Emma she’s nuts. She started having a go at me about 2 years ago. I didn’t know who she was but liked something she put,  sorriest thing I did  She started asking me do I follow Natasha I said yes so she started giving me loads. I just said oh fuck off weirdo and blocked her x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m all for schools teaching kids about LBGT and equality but not at 4 They’re babies for Gods sake, there’s no reason for them to know about any relationships at that age  Let them be innocent kids for as long as you can, They grow up too quick as it is x<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MICHELLEJDUDA This is so true. My hubby found out this morning he’s got a tumour on the bladder 😢. We’re still in shock  Sorry about your friends love. That’s no age 😢 xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndiaWilloughby I was more of a Spandau girl x. Was obsessed with Martin Kemp x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LivEchonews So she’s heartbroken cos she’s not allowed back but not fazed by seeing a decapitated head in a bin  Says it all really<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some of the stuff @jackwhitehall was saying to the artists was actually making me cringe 🤦‍♀️. #BRITs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bekijo1 @Pink @BRITs She was amazing as always. #legend xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndiaWilloughby @Martina Just ignore the trolls India. Hope you had a great night at the #Brits xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blessbabe I was. Love him 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Obviously gutted @takethat didn’t win The outstanding Contribution to Music Award. But couldn’t be happier that the amazing @Pink won it  What a legend. #welldeserved. #superstar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaWardle3 @EvaaRashid Don’t think so hun x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jenkins_shell @kazwilliams75 They’re just pure scum 😡 xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jenkins_shell @kazwilliams75 So sorry that this has happened to you Hun . No one thinks your stupid, these scammers are very clever and make it look legit.  It could happen to any one of us. Have you contacted them ? X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When something seems too good to be true  It usually is..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarbaraLadmore Oh dear 🤦‍♀️😆. Happy Birthday Barbara xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m going to see Take That with @Topic_UK and @johnsmithstadia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustLukeyA Hope so 🙏. Had withdrawals in January 😆 xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustLukeyA @bbuk Do you think another channel will pick it up in the future Luke ? X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True story 👌🏽  https://t.co/3KDBdhlJJa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@val_griffiths29 @dfromthep @Specsavers Well said Val. Just another typical monkey see monkey do jumping on the band wagon without knowing the facts!!  If you want to make yourself look interesting then give us some up to date constructive news instead of scraping the barrel 😴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LivEchonews She deserves sympathy???  She doesn’t deserve anything. Why should we give her sympathy we never sent her there,  that was her own doing. Let her get on with it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@susuejones The sad part is, the final editing wasn’t down to the fans who are in it but they’re the ones who are getting made to feel shit because they got chosen and get shown more than once xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shouldn’t we all just be happy for each other? That’s what fandoms are supposed to be about,  If it’s like this now what’s it gonna be like when the tour starts 🙄. I wait with baited breath 🤦‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What’s with all the negativity in the fandom at the minute ? Does it really matter that much that the same few were chosen for the video ? No it doesn’t, it’s just a video for God’s sake  And it doesn’t seem fair that other fans are putting the dampener on their achievement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnnableKerry @Specsavers @GaryBarlow Exactly this 👏.  If your paying someone to represent you in any way you will trust what they tell you as they’re meant to know what they’re doing  I’d have done the exact same thing xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blessbabe Well done love xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoonieCFC @takethat Sorry to hear this manon. It’s not like you  Maybe you’ll feel different nearer the time xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LivEchonews The fact that she said she saw a beheaded head in a bin and wasn’t fazed by it shows what type of person she still is. She’s an extremist not a victim. Leave her were she belongs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndiaWilloughby Have a great time India x. Hope it goes well xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ccole_99 Aww gutted. Only just got in from work so missed out 😦 xx<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Worst thing for any parent is to see their grown up child hurting. Wish I could take his pain away and tell him it’ll all be ok. Feel so helpless 😢😢💔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheMalonesGB My kids are shocked when I tell them we used to go the park on our own when we were kids  Jam butties, bottle of cream soda and a fishing net and jam jar 😂. Wouldn’t dream of letting kids go to same park on their own nowadays  Sad times 😢 xxx<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ccole_99 Fortunately small minded vile little bigots are a minority,  the majority of people are accepting to the gay community and see you as a person and not a label As the saying goes Those that mind don’t matter and those that matter don’t mind  Just keep being you  Love you xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shellieGBlawson @takethat @Joannew31 @Silverbuttons11  https://t.co/wv0NLvc6JY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JXplain @SamanthaMesse10 So you’re calling Lewis a bully in the tweet  then saying “defo all bullied at school “ like that’s a good thing.  Which is it ?  You don’t like bully’s ? You like bully’s ? Aah I get it. You are the bully 🤷‍♀️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@andyldeegan @LivEchonews But don’t you think it’s good that they’re pre warning people about this disgusting place ?  I mean who wants to stay in filth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ccole_99 Aww how cute is this ❤️ xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ccole_99 Lovely pic Cameron x.  Your hair looks like it’s really grown xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeproudLGBTQ22 @HousingFirstUK Glad to hear it.  Disgusting behaviour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@velomonsoon Shallow minds unfortunately 😔 x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Danielfoy11 @LukeKempner If I don’t rate someone I just scroll on. But you took the time to tweet him ? 🤷🏻‍♀️. What’s the point  I doubt very much he’s bothered what you think 🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fbbuk19 So sorry for your sad loss Aaron. Hope your ok mate   Sending love and hugs to you and your family x. RIP Anne xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joannewhitley78 Aww I can imagine  and the first Anniversary’s are always the worst aren’t they.  Hopefully he’ll be occupied with his new stuff and it might take his mind off it a bit xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joannewhitley78 Aww bless him.😢 xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christine6257 Haven’t even got Celeb Big Brother to look forward to in January 😭😭😭 xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anya_J_Anderson @topsymarie @lucy_PTN @MrsSMoz @MrsHeber @Rylan I find when my anxiety kicks in the last thing I want to do is clean   It affects my energy levels and makes me feel drained  But I guess it affects us all in different ways xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rylan @AnnieTT30 What is Zoflora ??  Are you being serious 😂😂. Ya put it in your mop bucket and clean ya floors.😂 xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ccole_99 Made up Harry won. Got all emoshe 😢 xxx<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan And the fact they only got 10 years is an insult to the poor baby’s memory   Fly high with the angels Stanley xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MacHouse_AH It was always the best grotto in town x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Can you blame her. After the way she got trash talked by trump. She wouldn’t have even got a nod off me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seeing @takethat and @robbiewilliams perform together on #xfactor was such a beautiful and emotional sight. It’s a tho he’s never left.❤️  Love how strong the bond is between you guys @GaryBarlow @OfficialMarkO @HowardDonald xxx<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JustLukeyA @eBay Didn’t Zoe get this ?  Has she put it on e bay ? X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ahfodtour2016 @danleeburke @JacobWright800 @bertiebenbow @TheFrankHindle @piersmorgan No proof he did it. But the girls mum has come forward and said it wasn’t Jamal it was a group of girls<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KellyBarlow98 Happy belated Birthday Kelly 🎉🎉🎈🎂. Sorry it’s late xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@poppyculcher Haha. I’d forgot about that xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, according to this idiot, if you kiss your kids on the lips your a weirdo.  Says more about him as a person than all the parents who make sure their kids feel loved and wanted.  Obviously never got shown any affection as a kid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GpH1511 @poppyculcher @KimCashel @iamlewisdean Well said Poppy. My Ryan swears by meditation xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamlewisdean Have a look on google Lewis. That’s how I found a local meditation class for my son xxx. Sending love to you x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>❤️❤️❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Nothing weird about showing your kids affection and letting them know they’re loved. So if you think it’s weird to kiss your child on the lips, it says more about you than David Beckham<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GpH1511 It is Harry. The school needs to step in and put a stop to it x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@poppyculcher Poppy this has made me cry  Those poor kids,  The disturbing part is, these racists are children xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kaylazoe @takethat Ooooh I’m going into town on Saturday. Hope it’s still on 😊 xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeamGaryB_x Report the account Hun xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@badlandsbutera_ @J_B_smithh @MoKhanRS That reminds me of when I was out one night with a top on from Sainsbury’s and some girl said ooh did you get that top from River Island ?  I’m like yep 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarbaraLadmore Aww best feeling ever.  I had my 4 grandsons yesterday aged from 9 weeks to 8  They keep us on our toes but love it when they’re here xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustLukeyA Aww they’re beautiful Luke xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ccole_99 Cameron just block them love xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acaciaxaaliyah_ I like Ayda. But my god does she need to shout so much when she talks ? 🙉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrMarkByron @den_sidebottom @IndiaWilloughby @davearnold64 God knows Mark 🤷🏻‍♀️ I might be wrong but I think he’s only got as far as he has because Louis Tomlinson took him under his wing  and got him help for his problem. The classic sob story x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@den_sidebottom @IndiaWilloughby @davearnold64 @MrMarkByron Haha I agree. He’s an idiot. And the way he says im doing this for Liverpool. No mate your embarrassing Liverpool 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndiaWilloughby Fair enough. I apologise for my rant x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davearnold64 @IndiaWilloughby Don’t agree with what India said,  being from Liverpool. But it’s hardly racist  Were the same race as the rest of the Uk 😂. I think she just has a problem with northerners ,  particularly scousers by the sound of it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndiaWilloughby India I really like you and I’ve always supported you but I do find your comment offensive Why ban all Liverpool contestants ?  I’m from Liverpool and haven’t voted for Anthony, he is a pain in the arse but that doesn’t mean any future contestants will be the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can’t believe the tweets I’m reading about Scarlett Lee  Why do people feel the need to be so vile about someone’s weight. Scarlett is a beautiful girl with an amazing voice and really doesn’t deserve all this hate Does it make you feel better about your own sad lives #xfactor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamlewisdean She had to listen to it ???  Did someone have a gun to her head forcing her ?? Just block her Lewis ya don’t need this negativity on your timeline xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angelcakepics I used to live in St Oswald Gardens<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamlewisdean Love your way of thinking Lewis. You really do inspire me ❤️ xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamlewisdean Looking forward to reading it Lewis xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndiaWilloughby Enjoy 😊 xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ccole_99 Doubt she’d have much time to go on social media given she’s a full time carer to her son who has additional needs, he’s her priority. Love @BBUKZoeJones tho and hope she’s doing well xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/Ztute0g9Wg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markydays I did wonder this.  They formed in 1990 which makes it 29 years next year 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fbbuk19 @Proud2Served @Bjessie100Linda @iamlewisdean Best way to deal with them. They say things for a reaction and stupid me always bites.🤦‍♀️.  Gonna have to learn to zip it 😂😂🤐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dad_triple @ccole_99 He’s so sweet the way he has so much time for his followers  x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@poppyculcher Will do love. Hang one while I follow you x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fbbuk19 @Proud2Served @Bjessie100Linda @iamlewisdean I know @iamlewisdean said for us not to respond to trolls but some people just wind me up to the point I can’t keep my gob shut 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Proud2Served @fbbuk19 @Bjessie100Linda @iamlewisdean Not as hilarious as the fact you’ve bothered to take the time to reply to a fan page considering your not even a fan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Maria_M80 @bexterragga I’m not sure wether there’s an online shop. Hope you manage to find some xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Maria_M80 @bexterragga They’ve got long sleeve fleece pjs in primark x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamlewisdean Sorry Lewis. One of them was me   I tell you and Cameron to block then I end Up retaliating to some dickhead 🙄. Need to practice what I preach xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@poppyculcher @zeal76151618 @kt_pepper @dsd310580 Thanks for the heads up poppy 👍. Another sad twat with too much time on their hands x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dsd310580 @DavidMackayy @92shaunna @iamlewisdean @ccole_99 Aww sorry to hear that  Hopefully they’ll come around in time. One of my other sons is a bit like that with my gay son. He’s ok with him but can’t look him in the eye when he talks to him and I can tell he feels uncomfortable around him  Sad really that people are like that x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zeal76151618 @poppyculcher @iamlewisdean @kt_pepper @dsd310580 @ccole_99 Zeal are you actually serious ?  Lewis doesn’t talk about Akeem he said he’s fake but he actually likes the guy, that’s just his honest opinion. Lewis has moved on with his life unlike Akeem and his family and fans who are still stuck in a hateful bubble  They need to move on too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidMackayy @dsd310580 @92shaunna @SoulfulSausages @iamlewisdean @ccole_99 Dave you’ll probably find people surprise you. My son is gay and was scared to come out as all his mates are straight, he thought they’d start feeling uncomfortable around him. He couldn’t of been more wrong. They all hugged him and said “we already knew and it changes nothing”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ccole_99 Just keep being you Cameron. Your a lovely genuine lad. Some people’s lives are that sad and shitty, the only way they can feel better about themselves is by making others feel like shit. Just block them mate  and rise above it.  Sending lots of love xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fitbitch1989 @Cirah_TV @ccole_99 Probably sick of people’s snide remarks on twitter 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KWETribute @ccole_99 Great advice 👍 x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ccole_99 Yeh Shat ap Heather. You’re chatting shit 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamlewisdean Aww Lewis so sorry to read this 😢. Just remember how many of us love you and support you every step of the way ❤️.  You give others the best advice but sometimes you need people to be there to help you x. Hope you overcome these feelings and feel better soon   Love you mate xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobJonesRSJ @iamlewisdean @ccole_99 Fab pic. You lucky man 😃 x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamlewisdean Anyone who takes the time to go on your twitter with the sole purpose of writing something shitty are just trying to compensate their own shitty sad lives xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustLukeyA Looking very smart xx.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElaineD32375493 @Mrs_V_6047 @ccole_99 👍😂😂😂😂 x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mrs_V_6047 @ElaineD32375493 @ccole_99 I’m a Michelle and agree with everything yous say  can I stick with yous too 😂😂😂 xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ccole_99 They’re snakes mate. Fake phoney snakes.  Just rise above it and just keep being you  Your a lovely genuine lad and I love how you’ve kept your dignity through it all. And this is why YOU were the winner and not any of them  Sending big hugs to you and @iamlewisdean  Love ya both<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealEmpy @ccole_99 @iamlewisdean @kieran_armitage Fab pics  Love how you’ve become friends with Lewis and Cameron xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamlewisdean That’s obvious. They know how loyal @ccole_99 is to you so they wouldn’t be able to go on their usual bitchfest with Cameron in the group. Nothing but a bunch of old women   🐍🐍🐍🐀🐀🐀. xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamlewisdean @ccole_99 Hilarious. 😂. You two should have your own show 😂😂😂 xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamlewisdean @ccole_99 Love you 2 and your strong bond ❤️. That’s one thing B.B. can never take away from you xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The_JamesJordan Plus  it would of been hard to keep in tune with all those dance moves going on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The_JamesJordan Wasn’t great. But at least she didn’t mime and try and be something she’s not, like a lot of them do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sxphie_blxnt Exactly this 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 x.  I think he looks 🔥.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyLewisF @fbbuk19 @iamlewisdean @ccole_99 Love this ❤️❤️ xx<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GaryBarlow @OfficialMarkO @HowardDonald @ccole_99 @iamlewisdean 👈(my inspiration)  ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fbbuk19 @iamlewisdean @The_JonFrost Oh God, one of them 🙄🙄. But on a brighter note look what happened to Akeem.  Everyone finally saw him for the snake ( or slink haha) that he really was  x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fbbuk19 @iamlewisdean @The_JonFrost Aww right  . So he’s a sneaky little twat then !!  🤔 x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fbbuk19 @iamlewisdean @The_JonFrost If this person goes out of his way to purposely be shitty to you it just proves he’s the one living a shitty sad life. Says more about him than you.  I know it must be hard but try and be the bigger person.  Is there a teacher or lecturer you can talk to ? X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whitefrank95 @Louis_Tomlinson Haha. We heard that. 🤦‍♀️🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClaireButler8 @VickyHassall @OfficialMarkO No words ..  just wow 😍😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JessOwen_TT Me too. I’m a bit partial to a man with a pony tail 😍 And when that man looks like Mark well what can I say... ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow  Dalton you just smashed it. Amazing 🌟. #XFactor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamlewisdean @fbbuk19 @The_JonFrost Aww Aaron you know we’re all here for you. We’re all here for each other  I’ve spoke to you a few times and I’ve told you about what my son is going through and you listened to me and I appreciate that as I got a lot of my chest. Mate your worth a lot more than you realise xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanR1002 Should of removed her immediately through the door on her right 😆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My God. If Olly Murs was a bar of chocolate he’d of ate himself by now 🙄.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ccole_99 @iamlewisdean Never read such a load of shit 🙄  @iamlewisdean  you were one of the most genuine, real people ever to go in there.  Unlike some you never thought before you spoke you said it as it is. Which is why we love you. You and @ccole_99 2 of the best most real housemates ever. 😘😘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree. I’m a scouser and love Manchester and it’s people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharlieB121 @EvaaRashid @GaryBarlow Really ??  What a dickhead   He’ll never be half the man GB is or in the same league xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharlieB121 @EvaaRashid @GaryBarlow What did he say ? X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #ChildrenInNeed really puts things into perspective.  We complain about trivial unimportant things while these poor kids are going through so much and still have smiles on their faces and being so brave even when they’re in pain   Life can be so cruel 😢😢.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamlewisdean @TheSun Make sure they’ve printed exactly what you’ve said as the sun has a habit of twisting things and telling lies xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Den_Manning @suerowleytweets Wow. This person seriously needs help 😳  https://t.co/v1vRfYG2U6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamlewisdean @ccole_99 😂😂😂😂😢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealEmpy True words 👏🏼 xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ccole_99 You got your perm then ?   Looking good, let’s see it all xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ksnewberry @longislandmikeo @invisibleman_17 Doesn’t matter if it was staged. It still got the point across<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndiaWilloughby Omg she was so annoying.  Talk about love the sound of your own voice xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theteggy @EstherMcVey1 The trash took itself out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EstherMcVey1 Best news I’ve heard all week<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Denise_fergus @channel5_tv @caravan__media I watched it and was absolutely disgusted that they were trying to justify their actions. No excuse in the world can justify what those 2 done to your beautiful baby  There are plenty of 10 year olds who have bad abusive upbringings but wouldn’t dream of doing anything like this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMalonesGB @3TimesABaby Aww he’s so cute xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamlewisdean Love yous two ❤️. Just hate the fact I haven’t got insta 😔 xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ashleighconnerx @iamlewisdean Thank you 😘. I will do x.  Have you tried holistic therapy ?  I was wondering if that was any good xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ashleighconnerx @iamlewisdean I worry so much for my 26 year old son. He’s really struggling with anxiety and depression He’s been to countless drs, councillors, meditation etc but nothing seems to help. I’m terrified things are gonna get to point he can’t go on anymore 😢. I’m at a loss what to do next 😢😢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMalonesGB We’re in the process of toilet training my 2 year old grandson. He’s brilliant going for a wee but when it comes to a poo he refuses point blank  He hides under the table and either does it in his undies or leaves us a present 💩🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Elaine_clarke 🙌🏼🙌🏼😃😃 xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamlewisdean @ccole_99 Omg 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fbbuk19 Yayyyy 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼. So happy for you  Stay positive xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamlewisdean Lewis what was that book called that you recommended. Want to get it for my son he’s suffers with anxiety and he’s been struggling lately 😢. xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bekijo1 @GaryBarlow @Saxes1 Mike help. My zips broke !! 🤭🤭🤭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ccole_99 Have you watched the jail task yet Cameron ?  That was the funniest task of the series 😂. Hilarious 🤣🤣🤣 xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ccole_99 Baby bao bao 💗 😂😂😂 xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MLH3102 @piersmorgan 😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wbuxtonofficial @piersmorgan 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Considering I can’t stand Olly Murs I feel like I’m a member in all his fandoms the amount of times he’s been popping up in all my news feeds this past week 🙄. #goaway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VibeTickets The best boy band ever who are about to celebrate 30 years in the business with a tour next year  Lost 2 members along the way but still manage to put on the most spectacular shows as a 3 piece x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamlewisdean Looking forward to this xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ccole_99 This is why I won’t put my faves Take That on when I’m eating 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Sad but true 😢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fbbuk19 @iamlewisdean @ccole_99 @FbbukO Aww love this xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan That was so funny 😂. Your face 😂.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB Think this fella is sixpence short of a shilling. The funniest part was @piersmorgan nearly having a meltdown when this fruit cake said d**k 🤦‍♀️😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ccole_99 @iamlewisdean So proud of you @ccole_99 for the way you came out and embraced it. My son came out to me 3 years ago ( even tho I knew) age 23 and still finds it hard to accept himself for who he is   I’ll always be proud of him and your an inspiration to lads just like him x love you mate xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamanthaE151617 💔💔💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gracedavies @TheXFactor @michaelbuble Thought he retired 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And that’s a fact 👍😃😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMalonesGB Never liked him. He grates on my nerves xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamlewisdean Happy Birthday handsome.  Sending love and best wishes and hope your having a good one. Just keep being you xxx.  https://t.co/u3mtf9ae66<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So are they trying to tell us we’re thick 🤔😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fbbuk19 Hope your feeling better Aaron. Did you go to meditation? X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just be yourself 💋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True words 👌🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamlewisdean Happy Birthday Lewis x. Hope you’ve had a good night xxx  https://t.co/wTzKNVeV91<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We will remember x  https://t.co/X5m3EKxeYR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tinafos02171706 Me to the dog every time 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ccole_99 Thanks for the follow back Cameron. Really appreciate it 👍 xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ccole_99 @iamlewisdean Aww miss watching the bond between you 2.  @iamlewisdean any chance of a follow back ? xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Marjoleinnnn You never paid her did you ? 😳. Especially if she’s basically admitted it x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicoleWills95 @loosewomen After just hearing his last sentence “ My kids phone me to go out to dinner I’d never phone my father to go out to dinner cos he was a Plummer   I loved him but he was a Plummer “ so yes i agree I think he did meant it.  The more he speaks the more vile  I think he is 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really hope Rod Stewart was joking on @loosewomen when he corrected the presenter for introducing him as Rod and not Sir Rod and made her introduce him again with his proper title  If not, he’s a conceited prick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watching that woman on @GMB screaming in the faces of the doctor and the other guest cos they have a different opinion to her regarding child vaccinations. They don’t agree with you so get over it and stop embarrassing yourself on national tv #shameful 🤦‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fbbuk19 Aww good to hear.  Wishing you well and stay positive xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeatriceMArtist @iamlewisdean Me too 😍😂😂😂 x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamlewisdean Wow 😍. xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fbbuk19 Never apologise for how you feel.  Talking about your struggles is the best thing you can do and there’s a lot of people who will be able to relate to you on here. Have you tried Meditation?  My son finds it helps a lot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbuk @My5_tv  https://t.co/B4ICyhicCL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamlewisdean Feeling like shit 😢. Been off work for 2 weeks with a water infection. 2 lots of antibiotics later and it still won’t do one 😡. Pissing me off now ( no pun intended ha) xx. Enough about me. Hope your  ok xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Testing_1212 @Aisleyne1 @bbuk 😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@helenw18_helen @IndiaWilloughby My son said the same<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndiaWilloughby I still don’t understand why C5 have axed it if it’s been it’s highest rating show. Doesn’t make sense 🤔 xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamlewisdean I really need to get on insta. But haven’t got a clue how to set it up and how it works 🙈. Any of you guys run me through it ?  ( I’m not thick  just shit at stuff like this ) 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndiaWilloughby @slinehan1 Agree. Couldn’t believe how soon they brought Cian and Zoe out.  About  5 minutes into it 🤔 xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ali_gator_ @bbuk @TheBandMusical @takethat And the arms had to be done  it’s the law 😄✋🤚👏🏼 xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So who else was doing the arms to never forget at the end of #BBBots  #gbarmy  #thatters. #TT30<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@onsophssofa @iamlewisdean @FbbukO Love love love Lewis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YESSSSS. @iamlewisdean your little bro did it  😄👏🏼👏🏼.  Well done and well deserved @ccole_99  #bbukwinner18. #bbuk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ali_gator_ @bbuk It was all over for me when Lewis got kicked out 😢. Hope Cameron wins now tho xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamlewisdean Lewis how do you stay so controlled. All this shit I’m reading is pissing me right off and it doesn’t even involve me   Wish some people would get a fuckin grip xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeproudLGBTQ22 @bbuk Why would you not like someone just because they’re on benefits ?  ( and no I’m not on benefits I work full time ) just think it’s a shallow statement to make. She has a son with additional needs so she’s his full time carer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealEmpy @brian_belo @ChristyG_Journo @bbuk Hope so 🙏🏼. x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealEmpy @brian_belo @ChristyG_Journo @bbuk Mike do you think another channel will take it over ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ValerieUKuk @iamlewisdean That’s what I was thinking. Cos he talks about the book in that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorthLdnGuy @iamlewisdean I totally agree with you. I always have and always will be proud of him. He worked hard and he did earn it   It’s how he sees it tho  he feels like he’s been left with all this debt for nothing  Every time he’s applied for a job in media he got all the “not enough experience crap<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fbbuk19 Aww that’s lovely. Be proud mate xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillyT402 @iamlewisdean To be fair. And I’m not defending Akeem cos I can’t stand him but I doubt this has been done by his friends or family. I think it’s more likely some random freak show weirdo who watches the show  Whoever it is needs serious help<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorthLdnGuy @iamlewisdean My son has a degree in Media professional with television but found it impossible to get a job in that field after finishing uni. He now has a completely different occupation and says his degree means nothing All he got out of it was a load of student loan  debt to pay back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amanda578879 @iamlewisdean Same as my son. And still paying back his student loans for something that’s somewhat irrelevant to him now 😔.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seamusastewart @jacbarella @iamlewisdean I thought that was real until you pointed out the pic 🤦‍♀️.  Gotta agree with you on this one  There’s no way that can be real with a 2017 date and a B.B. background on the pic  And there’s no way he could of updated it either  Don’t think they’d even started auditions in 2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@findingyeri @iamlewisdean Haha. That’s spot on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Roadtripxx @iamlewisdean And not a tear in his eyes 🙄.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tazman1983 @iamlewisdean 😂😂😂😂.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@topaz87 @iamlewisdean That was hilarious.😂. Lewis completely owned Kevin 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KellyBarlow98 Exactly. Not one of us are perfect so no ones got the right to slag if someone else’s appearance  I could understand this if we were still teenagers, but grown women !!!  Unbelievable!! Xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KellyBarlow98 Or You’re a bit over weight   They’d be traumatised. Don’t they realise hurt feelings can work both ways ?   I personally hope he keeps his hair long. I’ve got a thing for men with a pony tail 😜  xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KellyBarlow98 How dare people tell him to get a shave and a hair cut  do they own him all of a sudden? . I’m fuming at this so called fandom  Grown women who are obviously all oil paintings. Imagine if one of them posted a pic of themselves and he replied Oh I don’t like your hairstyle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamlewisdean  Don’t put up with all the negative crap. If anyone tries to give you shit just block them. Try not to let them get to you mate xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rubb3rsoul1972 @TheMalonesGB That’s were my son first discovered them Glastonbury. He’s only 26 so didn’t really know much of their music but thought they were amazing. So when they announced the tour he jumped at the chance to come with me x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMalonesGB Yes they were. Forgot how many amazing songs they actually had. We went to echo arena Liverpool to see them xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMalonesGB I went to see ELO last Tuesday and have had Mr Blue Sky suck in my head ever since xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamlewisdean Think @iamlewisdean knows what he’s talking about a lot more than the viewers. He lived with him 24/7.  We see an edited version for 45 minutes a night 🤷🏻‍♀️.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@8___Tristan___8 @Fiona_Davies @Jadellox @iamlewisdean Interesting 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JMcbriarty @bernflastu @CallumTAndrews @iamlewisdean Me neither. I’d have liked Brooke in the final 2 with Cameron. Wouldn’t have minded which one won x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidRo10134165 @iamlewisdean It was embarrassing to watch 🤦‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bernflastu @CallumTAndrews @iamlewisdean I agree. I’ve been saying for weeks he thinks he’s won it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lindsayrankine @iamlewisdean Says it all 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lindireed @iamlewisdean It did on #BBBOTS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bernflastu @CallumTAndrews @iamlewisdean Thought he was gonna have a meltdown tonight when Emma said there was a second eviction .  And the bit were he was talking to himself in the bath ( for our benefit)  was so cringe 🤦‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that’s the most I’ve heard Sian talk all series. Just shows how chatty you can be when you haven’t got a ciggy hanging out your mouth #bbuk #BBBOTS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GillSteps Well done.😊 x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reardon_paul @iamlewisdean It means he had 0 before he went on big brother he’s got over 14 thousand now 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fiona_Davies @Jadellox @iamlewisdean Thanks Fiona<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KittyKatPK @bbuk @channel5_tv Just hope another channel buys it 🙏🏼. ( even tho I said I wasn’t watching it any more after Lewis hot kicked out ). But I’m too addicted not to 😄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbuk @channel5_tv Wonder wether another Channel will buy it 🤔.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KittyKatPK @bbuk @channel5_tv Really ?  Didn’t know that 😲<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cathhayes2 @iamlewisdean @bbuk Thank you. X. Sorry about your daughter  Yes it is heartbreaking seeing them suffering  and there’s nothing you can say or do that will make them feel better. My son is 26 and has suffered with anxiety and depression since he was 16 but this years been his toughest 😢 x.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RitaBruceEFC @iamlewisdean Me neither. Wouldn’t have it near the house<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fiona_Davies @Jadellox @iamlewisdean Have you got the link please Fiona ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maximusmom22 @iamlewisdean @girlsmeg So you believe a newspaper that’s renowned for the lies it tells over what Lewis has actually told us.? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cathhayes2 @iamlewisdean @bbuk Exactly. I think a lot of us could see ourselves or someone close to us ( in my case my son ) in him which is why we could relate to him. He was talking about counselling last night and mentioned holistic therapy being good which is one my son hasn’t tried  I’m gonna book him in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cathhayes2 @iamlewisdean @bbuk This is why I love him. He’s an open book  says what he thinks  but sometimes speaks before he thinks 🙈. But he’s real   Watched his instagram last night  couldn’t drag myself away from my phone. Talks a lot of sense x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cathhayes2 @iamlewisdean @bbuk And I’m actually gutted @iamlewisdean went. Love him. But my point is you can’t pick and choose what your offended by just cos it affects you  ( not you personally you in general )<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cathhayes2 @iamlewisdean @bbuk Thing is. Channel 5 is owned by Viacom whos executives are mainly Jewish which is probably why they wanted him out   But it’s a shame they didn’t show the same respect for the black community when Rodrigo twice used the N word  But I agree with everything you say @cathhayes2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamlewisdean Oh I’m not on insta 😭😭😭.xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealEmpy @winner_lewis @iamlewisdean @FbbukO Aww gutted. Didn’t know nothing about this and missed out 😔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@A_n_R__ @iamlewisdean Well said Hun x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarbaraLadmore just been catching up on last nights BBBOTS and I’m literally crying with laughing 😂😂 You were hilarious. I told you a few days ago you were a legend   #sitonlewis’sface. 😂. Gonna miss your banter  Barbara. #BBBOTS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DakotaLula Says it all when last night show was mainly flashbacks to actual good bits<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@karenpenf @iamlewisdean To be fair I reckon he’s not allowed to say anything yet with B.B. still being in air. Maybe he’s had to sign something to keep quiet? I think once B.B. is over he’ll tell us ( hopefully)   Just my opinion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maureenleonard1 @iamlewisdean Maybe there’s a claws were he’s not allowed to tell us yet with B.B. still being on air. They could potentially sue him ?   I think if he could tell us he would. Lewis is as real and genuine as they come x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brownsandra1962 @iamlewisdean That’s so heartbreaking for you and your family  As if you haven’t been through enough losing your brother and nephews the last thing you need is tabloid shit 😢. So sorry for your loss hun xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tremendous_tv She’s got it all worked out in her head 💰😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@summeryves @Berriicrazii @iamlewisdean I hope he wins too.  I’ve had it on but spent most of the time with my head in my phone it was that boring<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Akeem is trying so hard to win he’s starting to come across as desperate. It cringe to watch 🤦‍♀️ #bbuk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So in less than a week big brother has gone from one of the best series in years to one of the most boring series in years  How is that even possible 🤔. Oh wait..  you kicked @iamlewisdean out   Not such a clever move then 🙄. #bbuk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slinehan1 Spot on 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watched a video on fb were Wetherspoons refused to serve an old war veteran. This is beyond disgusting and Wetherspoons should hang their heads in shame   This poor old man fought for his country and should be getting looked after not treated like this. My blood is boiling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FbbukO @AaronNeely2017 Would love him to come to my hometown of Liverpool 😊. #needAselfie  ❤️xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@delon03 @bbuk I like your comment up until you say Cian to win. Noooo. He grated on my nerves. Cameron or Brooke for me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LatinKrazyUK @bbuk He already thinks he’s won 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slinehan1 @bbuk @iamlewisdean It’s boring now 😴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FbbukO Enjoy xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Arlene80222919 @Indigo353643711 @iamlewisdean Me too. Or Sian she’s even worse  #TwoPillowsForTwoFaces  😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Indigo353643711 @iamlewisdean Haha. Yes the same Akeem who nearly has a meltdown when called 2 faced. Then runs off to the garden and what’s the first thing he does ?  Starts being 2 faced 🙈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamlewisdean @FbbukO Love this.  I totally get you Lewis and have supported you from day 1 as my 26 year old son suffers from anxiety and watching you is like watching him your like 2 of the same person  ( same rants too😂) it was lovely knowing he’s not on his own  Your an inspiration to me and him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FbbukO Thank you @iamlewisdean for making #bbuk worth watching   Can’t even be arsed watching this final week. I don’t know what you said but judging by that video you’ve meant no malice by it ( didn’t think you did anyway ). Anyway hope this isn’t the last we see of you  Love you mate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is that really Sarah Brightman on #ThisMorning ?  Looks completely different I’d have never have recognised her<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@suebeloo @christine6257 @GaryBarlow @OfficialMarkO @HowardDonald Katie sure is one lucky girl 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealEmpy @FbbukO @iamlewisdean Good luck Mike  Hope you can make this happen.🤞. We deserve it but Lewis deserves it more x. #ThePeoplesWinner<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ILoveRobz Haha. I was the same. He liked mine and retweeted it. Nearly passed out 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@failinqwifi @fbbuk19 @iamlewisdean I agree. I had it on last night but just couldn’t get into it anymore. The sparks gone now. Lewis is fascinating, entertaining and that laugh 😂 loved his laugh.  Just hope Cameron can win it for him now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeAuchterlonie @yipadeedoodah @AndyWestTV @TheSun I agree. The @TheSun wouldn’t know the truth if it jumped out at them  vile rag. I’m not believing anything  unless it comes from @iamlewisdean or one of his sources , that’s when I’ll take it as fact . But it’s pointless everyone speculating  = Chinese whispers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamlewisdean Devastated you’ve gone Lewis. Don’t care who wins now as you’ll always be the winner in my eyes.  Absolutely gutted for you.  Take her mate xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pureshoressaint @BettyBadonk @tlelse @HenrieVIII @GeoffBrewer @GMB My 26 year old son suffers  with anxiety and goes off into the occasional explosive rant  but NEVER has anything racist ever come out of his mouth and it never would , because he wasn’t brought up to be racist. So sorry , no excuse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanRoberts__ @slinehan1 Rodrigo said the N word twice and only got away with a warning    I agree with you can’t have been worse than that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brudoc969 @4misspinkypink4 @fbbuk19 @bbuk Yeh. I agree with you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LadyBFG @BarbaraLadmore @Hani_C @Tasha88922264 @RealEmpy I agree. I totally get him. As I’ve said before my son suffers with the same form of anxiety and it’s been like watching my son on there They’re like 2 of the same person<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@4misspinkypink4 @fbbuk19 @bbuk IF this is true which I doubt cos the sun wouldn’t know the truth if it jumped out at them but if it is it doesn’t even make sense. Why throw him out for getting his words mixed up  It’s not like he’s made any derogatory comments towards Jewish people or what they went through<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LadyBFG @Tasha88922264 @RealEmpy @BarbaraLadmore Exactly. Your mother is right 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mazzarox13 @RealitySnapsUK We’ll just have to agree to disagree on that one 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@perftronnie @fbbuk19 Me too 😔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Exhale117 It wasn’t actually the producers that wanted rid of him , it was channel 5. The producers fought hard to keep him in but C5 was having none of it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmilyGA12 @fbbuk19 I’ve always said it was fixed for Helen wood to win from the start.  No one can be that vile and dislikable and still go on to win<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on guys.  If we can’t vote  @iamlewisdean as our winner then vote for the next best thing  #Camerontowin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How lovely is this  Actually brought a tear to my eyes  #BFF. #beautifulbond. #teamlewis. #camerontowin. @FbbukO   #bbuk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarbaraLadmore @FbbukO They kicked him out so the least the voting public deserve is an explanation as to why !!  Plus it will put an end to the kangaroo court and the endless Chinese whispers and rumours that’s going round<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AuntCunt @BarbaraLadmore It was a conversation between him Brooke and Cameron that he said something  Tomasz wasn’t in the conversation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. Lewis has really been put through a kangaroo court tonight. Never realised there were so many judges and jury members on twitter  Yes we all know he’s said something he shouldn’t  but none of us know what, so why jump to your own conclusions  Just wait till Sunday #bbuk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lovelybubs @ej09 @bbuk Was gonna say the same.😂. Always looks like he needs a good scrub 😷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chards_Mariee @slinehan1 @bbuk I remember her saying that. I was like ugggh. 😷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fabinsanity @slinehan1 They told us why that first girl Ellis was removed. Due to racist tweets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrsafrica @Jan28Daniels @bbuk It’s no use making assumptions now. All will be revealed on Sunday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My workmates 😂😂😂🙈🙈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FbbukO Hope your feeling ok Lewis. We love you and you’ll always be the winner in our eyes   Take care mate xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KingwankaTeddy @gurlbuhbye @LadyDetectives1 @bbuk Doubt it’s that but we’ll hopefully find out Sunday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KingwankaTeddy @gurlbuhbye @LadyDetectives1 @bbuk Won’t be true. The conversation was between him Brooke and Cameron   Nothing to do with any of the others<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeffsy1981 @LadyDetectives1 @bbuk What did he say ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@megg_princess @LadyDetectives1 @bbuk No. 😂  no one knows yet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Missy_Nat99 @HolzMatty @LadyDetectives1 @bbuk His family have heard about the racial Chinese whispers and have made a statement saying it had nothing to do with racism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slinehan1 @DegenerateMma @LadyDetectives1 @bbuk Plus it was a conversation between him Brooke and Cameron. Nothing to do with Akeem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LynMadeleine @__chxrll According to his family the producers fought to keep him in. It was the station that wanted him out   I’m not watching it no more either. I’ll watch Sunday to see do they tell us why he got thrown out but that’s it   Done with it now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UtdMattlaa91 @Ginjarella @ProtectorGlenn @__chxrll @fbbuk19 FFS calm down mate. Your gonna burst a blood vessel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UtdMattlaa91 @Ginjarella @ProtectorGlenn @__chxrll @fbbuk19 His own family have tweeted and said it’s nothing to do with racism.  And what’s with the name calling cos I have a different opinion than you. So fuckin rude<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ginjarella @UtdMattlaa91 @ProtectorGlenn @__chxrll @fbbuk19 Love how people jump to conclusions without knowing fuck all 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealitySnapsUK Doesn’t matter who wins now. The real winner got kicked out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slinehan1 @bbuk 😢😢😢😢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hey_Judexx I haven’t watched it tonight yet  but he does know she’s Claytons mother  she was already in it before nick left<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sneakyboo @tremendous_tv @slinehan1 Exactly. If they’re gonna remove him surely we’ve got a right to know why<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbuk Favourite memory ? Errrm 🤔.  Oh yes  the moment he was evicted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sarajon21 @FbbukO @ccole_99 Ive always said it was a fix for Helen wood to win.  Once she got the pass to the final she was a vile nasty bully right  through the show but still won 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lozza_1977 @DebMcVicar66 @bbuk Well we’ll wait till Sunday then we can say wether it was clearly justified or not. And according to the family #bbuk producers fought to keep him in  it was channel 5 who wanted him out apparently<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FbbukO Please let Lewis know we love him and he’s always had so much support   Absolutely gutted he’s gone. Can’t even be arsed watching it now 😢 x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lozza_1977 @DebMcVicar66 @bbuk What did he do ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrys_alissa @bbuk @FbbukO @HealthyPlace Thank you.  Yes I agree  in my eyes #bbuk have exploited him which is so sad to watch, and a few of the HM need educating too.  My son doesn’t like Lewis but I think that’s because he can also see a lot of himself in him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bekijo1 @Channel4 That’s disgusting journalism. How hurtful for the family seeing that 😢 xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrys_alissa @bbuk @FbbukO @HealthyPlace I’ve supported Lewis from day 1 as my son who’s 2 years younger suffers from the same form of anxiety and it’s like watching a mirror image. He can be hard to live with at times too but I just bite my tongue count to 10 and just be patient and be there for him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bekijo1 @Channel4 I thought his son was in remission ?? X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lindsayrankine @fbbuk19 @bbuk Can’t be arsed with it anymore 😖<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly this 👇. We’ve got a right to know #bbuk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fbbuk19 Two pillows for two faces was hilarious 😂.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jan28Daniels @mrsafrica @bbuk Doubt he’s anti gay. Look how good he was with Cameron when he came out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PoetryLiterally @JasonOrangeLove @TTFansUnited @TakeThatAlways @TakeThatFanBase @takethatOZfans @take Brilliant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jan28Daniels @bbuk Yes I agree. And Tomasz just knocks me sick. And he always looks like he needs a good scrub. Vile<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbuk Good job this is the last one. You’ve just lost yourselves so many viewers now.    Well done #bigbrother  you’ve shot yourselves in the foot this time 👏🏼👏🏼. #bringlewisback  #teamlewis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThemanJordo @gemmaprice1988 @bbuk So because she’s got a different opinion to you  you insult her.?  How rude<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jan28Daniels @bbuk Can’t be any worse than that ken doll creature saying the N word twice and getting away with a warning.  You’ve thrown him out #bigbrother so the least you can do is tell us what he’s done<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cirah_TV And me   Gutted 😢 xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbuk So what did he say that was so bad ???   I won’t be watching anymore now. He’s the only one that stopped me getting bored of it weeks ago<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarbaraLadmore @Tasha88922264 @rubydoodledoo @RealEmpy @LadyBFG Love the banter between you and Rylan 😂. So funny x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BuntyFudge @fbbuk19 @Jo_RW_lambert @emmyfeline @FbbukO @bbuk Yes I saw that too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tasha88922264 @RealEmpy @LadyBFG @BarbaraLadmore I replied to the girl. Why am I a pervert cos I support Lewis. She said cos you wanna jump on his d**k.  Haha I’m old enough to be his mother 🙄.  And with the mouth on her it’s not me who’s the pervert<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarbaraLadmore @Tasha88922264 @rubydoodledoo @RealEmpy @LadyBFG Oh Barbara I’ve only just realised that it’s you. 😄. Aww i love you. Your a legend  😂 x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealEmpy @Tasha88922264 @rubydoodledoo @LadyBFG @BarbaraLadmore Thought that was you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tasha88922264 @RealEmpy @LadyBFG @BarbaraLadmore I agree with all these comments over the insults Really no need to insult someone just cos they have a different opinion. I’m team Lewis and have been called a dumb cunt  been told I’m the reason the show’s been axed 😂. And been called a pervert 🤔. Sad people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealEmpy @Tasha88922264 @rubydoodledoo @LadyBFG @BarbaraLadmore Mike were you on bots last night. Sitting on the end ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulG_Lon @Mimi__Morrison @bbuk That’s how I react each night when Tomasz starts his perv talk to be fair   But I am team Lewis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulG_Lon @Mimi__Morrison @bbuk  https://t.co/XsxMivp8ft<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulG_Lon @Mimi__Morrison @bbuk  https://t.co/Ret5TajxJk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MCJCarter90 Lewis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TriMay Her opinion is as irrelevant as her    She’s a horror !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@officialchris30 @bbuk Preferably Tomasz.  He knocks me sick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffLynnesELO Donovan looks like he’s ready for his bed 😄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@annamarie4679 @slinehan1 @FbbukO If it wasn’t for Lewis I’d have lost interest weeks ago<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lilmisswestie @FbbukO @NicolaMcLean @lizziecundy Who even are they ???  Pair of no marks !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sharon_cun @FbbukO Baggy broads ??  More like old bag broads !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does #bbbots always seem to get Lewis haters on the panel.  Should be a more of a mixed panel #bbuk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FbbukO He was brilliant 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best episode of the series 😂😂. #bbuk. #savebigbrother<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilTSuperFan @bbuk 🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whitefrank95 @bbuk Hilarious 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmHUAL Really ???  😱. That’s bad x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustLukeyA What a tit 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Definitely the best task of the series. So funny 😂. #bbuk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@0bsidianSn0w @bbuk I think what’s made it so good this year is they’ve got ordinary housemates with ordinary jobs in and not the usual wannabes who already have a bit of media history  and half of them already have agents<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t you just love it when the spelling police pop up with a spelling mistake while they’re trying to belittle you over your spelling mistake 🤦‍♀️😂😂😂.  Well that shut you up 🤣.  #priceless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JessOwen_TT I agree. People getting involved in an old grudge that wasn’t even there’s to begin with. So childish and boring 🙄. Hope your ok  So sorry about what happened , it really does put things into perspective xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melhick24_h @galfor @mrsheppie @StaceyW87896840 @bbuk They do all bitch. No ones disputing that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stefan9925 @galfor @mrsheppie @StaceyW87896840 @bbuk Do you mean misuse 😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeniferlwrence @galfor @mrsheppie @StaceyW87896840 @bbuk Well I can tell by your tweets you don’t exactly like him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeniferlwrence @galfor @mrsheppie @StaceyW87896840 @bbuk Well that works both ways doesn’t it.  You hate Lewis for doing the exact same as Sian  so we must both be hypocrites<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeniferlwrence @galfor @mrsheppie @StaceyW87896840 @bbuk To be fair, they all do it. The difference with Lewis is whatever he says behind the backs  he’d say to their face  Nothing to do with being sexist. I like Brooke and Zoe  just can’t take to Sian<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbuk She had no intention of not saving herself  just wanted to try and make herself look good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@galfor @mrsheppie @StaceyW87896840 @bbuk Well there’s nothing genuine about waiting till someone walks out the room or garden then start bitching about them, which she does constantly Why not say it to their face while they’re still there And that stupid smirk she does is so annoying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@galfor @mrsheppie @StaceyW87896840 @bbuk Genuine 😂😂. She’s the worst 2 faced back stabber in there 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fbbuk19 The vile sex pest needs to go<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blaze12121 🙈🙈😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffLynnesELO  Thank you all for an amazing night at Echo Arena Liverpool. Enjoyed every minute x  https://t.co/YbWMeKBXAZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@icequeenie @bbuk Then when Akeem mention it to Lewis  Lewis said are you asking me or telling me. Akeem says asking   Not so brave to his face is he 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bekijo1 😱😱😂😂😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blaze12121 Haha. He knocks me sick. Yes he does look like he needs a good scrub   Dirty perv.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glowxquotes @slinehan1 @bbuk So did I 🙈🙈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shellieGBlawson @Joannew31 @takethat @Silverbuttons11  https://t.co/azOUXvzNdv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bexterragga This was disgusting. That poor lady having to put up with some small minded bigot shouting his mouth off  It’s 2018 not the 1950s ffs  And as for @Ryanair   Shame on you !!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slinehan1 @bbuk Tomasz is knocking me sick carrying on like a perv.  It’s sexual harassment at its best<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is Tomasz allowed to get away with his constant sexual harassment towards Akeem   If that was a man doing it to a woman they’d be dragged to the diary room and given a warning #BBUK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tasha88922264 To all the haters.  https://t.co/o2fE1t65Wc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So it seems the more favours ya do for people the more ya get taken advantage of. And as soon as ya ask them for a favour ya get fucked off. Time to stop being a soft shite now!!!  Ya live and learn 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slinehan1 It’s a 🐍🐍🐍. Haha x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fbbuk19 Waited till  Lewis had walked out the garden and into the house then starts bitching about him. Why didn’t she just say it to his face the little snake<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. Exactly this 👇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#teamlewis. #lewistowin. #bbuk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ILoveRobz Spot on 👏🏼👏🏼. Well said<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Richie_EXP @zoe_ay @DanielleJavaid @bbuk @channel5_tv I thought eggs were a dairy product too 🤔. I’ll have to google that now 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheGayKingdom1 @bbuk  https://t.co/MieyfKpcSD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GigglingGinge @slinehan1 @bbuk Yes. I noticed that too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it’s hilarious how people get all offended and start name calling when someone has a different opinion to them   Just because you don’t like a housemate that someone else does you call them a cunt 🤔. How old are you. 10 ?? 🤣🤣🤣🤣. #bbuk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheGayKingdom1 @bbuk Why ?  Because my opinion is different from yours ? 🙄😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheGayKingdom1 @bbuk No I’ll stop watching it when he gets evicted  #teamlewis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blessbabe Yeh. That pisses me right off too. X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryBarlow this is my friend @joannewhitley78 cake for her birthday yesterday.  What would top it would be a belated happy birthday message xxx  https://t.co/IwIeU219ZL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joannewhitley78 @GaryBarlow Fab night @joannewhitley78  xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbuk Why are people saying it’s a fix that Lewis stayed. He won the game changer fair and square  that’s why he wasn’t evicted  Nothing fixed about it 🤷🏻‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbuk Hussain and Thomasz   #LewisToWin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FbbukO  https://t.co/CrCL3KfBuB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tatey61 Well said. 👏🏼👏🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the words of #LewisF. That’s to everyone who nominated me 🖕🖕     #LewisToWin   #BBUK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbuk Yessss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sam_mellodew @seamusastewart @donkydonks @Aisleyne1 It’s called. Don’t get mad get even.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Aisleyne1 But he didn’t actually ask anyone to do his dirty work. Zoe took it upon herself to get involved. He knew Hussain was only trying to get a reaction from him and he didn’t rise to the bait   that doesn’t make him a pussy being one step ahead  Hussain just looked like a soft twat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SLSK_2000 @Xtrapromo Exactly.  Lewis was in a no win situation  He never rose to the bait so gets called a coward.  If he’d have retaliated he’d of got called aggressive and possibly ended up getting a warning or at worse removed from the house   I think he made the right decision<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GetHussainOut.   #LewisToWin. #VoteLewis.  #BBUK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BigBrother why call Zoe to the diary room and tell Hussain to go to the bedroom ?  Shouldn’t that have been the other way round ?  Hussain was the one trying to instigate a fight. #BBUK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amandyat @bbuk @Hannahagboola_ @OfficialDebra @Rylan @jackjoeglenny @thejudijames Exactly. Lewis knew Hussain was only doing it to get a reaction from him. And he was wise enough not to give him it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ILoveRobz @slinehan1 Exactly this.  The night Hussain went in the house Lewis said  Don’t think he likes me I’ve tried to talk to him a few times and he ignored me.  And now Hussain’s trying to turn the tables that Lewis had the problem with him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That surely wasn’t Akeem being 2 faced with Hussain was it ?? 🤔. Well who’d of thought 🤷🏻‍♀️😏 #BBUK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well done Lewis for not rising to that vile snake Hussain.  Glad you didn’t give him the reaction he was looking for  #truecolours. #vile.  #lewistowin. #BBUK   @OFbbuk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THOUGHT FOR THE DAY                          Never argue with an idiot  🤦‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fbbuk19 @OFbbuk @bbuk I’ve just blocked one of the keyboard warriors for her vile and disgusting mouth  I can totally relate to Lewis as my son suffers with anxiety and I can see so many similarities between the 2 of them. Lewis has my vote and support  #votelewis. #lewistowin. #BBUK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OFbbuk @bbuk Done 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RogerSmith0909 @slinehan1 Haha yeh true 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RogerSmith0909 @slinehan1 Anyone remember the cartoon years ago. Johnny Bravo.  That’s who Lewis g is reminding me of🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shadyladytreez @MyVPoint @slinehan1  https://t.co/6AR2QQK15z<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shadyladytreez @MyVPoint @slinehan1 But that still doesn’t justify calling them perverts. You have your opinion on Lewis as others have theres and that’s fine having a different of opinion.  But to call people perverts just because they have a different opinion than you  is just rude and totally uncalled for<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shadyladytreez @MyVPoint @slinehan1 Ami missing something here ?  Why does liking Lewis make you a pervert 🤔.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@0bsidianSn0w @slinehan1 I thought this the other night when Ben Jardine was talking about her and had to look at the paper in front of him to see what her name was and pronounced it  See Ann  I thought then you’ve never even watched this series but your on here giving an opinion 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OFbbuk @bbuk Lewis has my vote 👍. #lewistowin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Akawhingy 😂😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbuk What gives Hussain the right to tell Isabella who she can or can’t cuddle with   Mind your own business you vile human 😡. #BBUK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OfficialMarkO @takethat 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jennibean85 I think he’s fit 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexmatealex Lewis won’t say anything behind your back that he won’t say to your face<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheWomanHolmes @AaronNeely2017 Probably fuming cos he doesn’t fancy her<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SOUP_SJT @AaronNeely2017 Well said 👏🏼👏🏼 xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AaronNeely2017 @OFbbuk Count me in 👍 x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you try your best to see past someone’s nastiness and hypocritical speeches, when you try and give them the benefit of the doubt   Then in the end you realise everyone was right and they’re  nothing but a hypocritical little horror #snake. 🐍🐍🐍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slinehan1 I can’t bare Sian<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slinehan1 @OFbbuk And has a meltdown when he gets called 2 faced.  Oh the irony<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@takethat Cry   Why Can’t I Wake Up With You   And I know it won’t happen but I’d love to hear Superstar   My fave song off the wonderland album xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HowardDonald @Gracefllness 🙈🙈😂😂😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cirah_TV Well now he knows how Zoe felt when he pushed her nose out for isabella<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rmayemsinger @KellyBarlow98 Haha. Brilliant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@takethat We’ll always be there for you guys ❤️. #bringonthetour. #TT30. xxx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbuk Hussain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HappyWindl Yes I agree they are all 2 faced. But I think it’s hypocritical to moan about being called 2 faced while your actually being 2 faced<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Akeem talking about Lewis to Hussain saying he’s fuming cos Lewis called him 2 faced...While he’s being 2 faced talking about Lewis 🙄. #hypocrite.  #BigBrother  #bbuk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaznay1961 @OFbbuk @jennibean85 @bbuk Lewis is more intelligent than the lot of them. None of them have got a brain cell between them.  Sians that self absorbed she’s doesn’t see what’s going on around her and don’t get me started on Hussain ......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fact True fact<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnnieTT91 @GBThaTTer72 @GaryBarlow No , I’m not feeling it either 😟 x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@craftymua @1982loula @GaryBarlow Aww cute. Bless her 😊 x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slinehan1 @AaronNeely2017 Akeem pissed me off the way he kept shouting “Your over sensitive “.  Of course he is, it’s one of the symptoms of his anxiety<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t know who is the dullest,Akeem or his brother Cory  #BBBOTS  #bigbrother<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amandyat @bbuk Just said the same. 🐍🐍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well done Lewis 👏🏼👏🏼. #lewistowin. #bbuk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cameron completely owned Hussain haha.  #Wounded  Cameron 1. Hussain 0   #bbuk. #bigbrotheruk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Mishafan1 Manchester , Huddersfield And Anfield 😊. Can’t wait x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mishafan1 Are you going the tour Helen x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Certain people putting posts up about #WorldMentalHealthAwarenessDay  Where were you when my son was at his lowest ?  Not one of you came near!!  Oh the irony. And you call yourselves friends   Get off the bandwagon you gang of jokes he’s found out who his real friends are<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AaronNeely2017 @OFbbuk @cathhayes2 @bbuk @dickndom @BBBots @Rylan Your not alone. Listening to Lewis is like a mirror image of listening to my son.  The same rants, the same anxiety and over analysing everything.  He’s  made me feel better knowing my sons not alone. #lewistowin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickDiPalma @OFbbuk @bbuk Totally agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbuk Pointless argument<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DollyDazzle @bbuk And big brother is allowing it to go on again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbuk When you suffer with anxiety you do over think and over analyse things.  He’s not doing it deliberately it’s just one of the symptoms. And the last thing he needs is some dick coming in winding him up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbuk Lewis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbuk Tomasz thinks he’s got a new mate in Hussain  He hasn’t realised Hussain has latched onto him cos he knows Tomasz is also playing a game so he needs to keep on top of what he’s thinking and planning  As the saying goes. Keep your friends close and your enemies closer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomsTARDlS Total respect to Cameron 🌈   People are just so bad minded and have to turn every positive into a negative.  So proud of him tonight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blessbabe @bbuk Total respect to him.  He reminded me of my son who came out to me 3 years ago ( even tho I already knew )  It was the hardest thing he’s ever done. He cried then I cried and give him a big hug and told him I was proud of him.  He’s my best mate x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbuk Total respect 🌈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonBrockMusic @shellnchris1965 @GaryBarlow And he was right xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OfficialScarLee @Barlowsurprise @lorraine Well done on getting through to the live shows. Thoroughly deserved x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sal_MSA @bbuk @channel5_tv I do agree with you up to a point  Lewis G was irritating but did make me giggle with his wind ups but Hussain just irritates the life out of me and I can’t wait to see the back of him   I might change my mind if the housemates put him in his place<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goodielfc4life @bbuk @channel5_tv I realised it was a fix the year Helen Wood got the pass straight to the final, then won.  There’s no way the public would have picked her as the winner. She was a vile bully<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@suerowleytweets @EvaaRashid @takethat Hahaha. This was my son this morning  have a meltdown trying for his Glastonbury tickets. Thank god he god them cos I think I’d have left town 🙈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_elliefrancesca I agree   I preferred the other girl.  She smashed Somebody Else’s Guy. Can’t believe she never got through<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbuk Well if he wants to win he’s going the wrong way about it.  No one likes a cocky arrogant prick who thinks he’s better than everyone else But I’m not surprised he had shades on in the house, his dress  sense must of been hurting his eyes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbuk If Isaac hadn’t been evicted we definitely would have saw fireworks between him and Hussain as he’s even more obnoxious than Isaac<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hussain is irritating before he’s even walked in the door. Get over yourself you fool. Your not all that  #BBUK #bigbrotheruk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isaacs face when Emma called his name was priceless   #wounded.  #BBUK  #bigbrotheruk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbuk Dont like him.  Disrespectful bully<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbuk Love the fact he finally had the courage to come out but I think he should have told his family first before telling the whole nation. ( even tho they obviously must of known anyway isn’t the point )<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lewis spitting his dummy out cos he can’t sit in first class on an aeroplane that’s not even a real aeroplane #getagrip  #spoiltarse   #BBUK #big brother<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bekijo1 I’ve met a lot of the usual girls at concerts and queues and they’ve all been lovely ( except for one who was vile towards me but I won’t name her on social media that wouldn’t be fair ).  I just live in hope my time will come  I’d probably go to bits if it did 🤣🙈xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is there only one Corrie tonight ? Or was there one on before bgt 🤔x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bekijo1 Oh Bek it just winds me up all this “same face”  https://t.co/Iqo7V387vQ theory is if it bothers you that much go join them and if you can’t don’t moan it’s not there fault just live and let live  One selfie would do me then I’d be happy for life 😂 xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bekijo1 I’ve never met them but that’s no ones fault but my own.because I can’t get to places due to work family etc.  If I could I would so I’d never hold a grudge against anyone who does. I help with campaigns and really happy for anyone who has there moment  Don’t get the negativity x<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@suebeloo Yeh he does have a good understanding group of friends.  He had to come home from work today because he was so upset. He made some excuse to his boss about family problems so he let  him go. He phoned his best friend Suzy and she was at ours within half an hour and sat with him x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@suebeloo No Hun. They didn’t share the same circle of friends.  We live in Liverpool  and Tom ( my sons gay ) lives in Manchester and that was a part of the problem , the distance. But he’s my sons first boyfriend so it’s hit him hard xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@suebeloo Aww bless her. Glad she come out the other side and found happiness xxx<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Wayziewoo @ALISONGBARMY @SouthernMrsOwen Same with me. My youngest son is gay and I tried to educate her that it’s not a mental illness and not a choice and she blocked me like I was the one in the wrong 🤔. I worry more about how much of an obsession it is with her   It’s that obsession that’s not normal  #inthecloset?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you get blocked by a homophobic twat for telling her a few home truths 😂😂👏🏼👏🏼.  Either the truth hurts or someone needs to come out the closet 🤔.  #obsessed  #ignorant  #vile<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ALISONGBARMY Just to clarify being gay is NOT a mental illness and it’s not a choice. I’ve had someone very close to me sobbing on my shoulder asking me why he was born like  this and saying  he hates being gay and hates himself for being this way but can’t help the way he is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ALISONGBARMY Shit. I missed it. It’s not normally on on a Thursday  I’ll have to watch it on catch up.<|endoftext|>
