<|startoftext|>@da1daOnlySela @DBShinigami @djdickout @kayleighmcenany there's a huge difference between asking a child to put a coat on, which is natural, versus having them put on a mask that can cover their entire face. It's not sized nor rated for them to use and it's unnatural. Many Pediatricians are shouting about this as a form of abuse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JIMBOMXN Also, a lot of assumed covid 19 cases were counted without testing. Comorbidities were also altered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JIMBOMXN We will never know the accurate number of deaths tied to covid 19, itself. In the States we had massive medical error by the use of ventilators. when the lungs can ventilate they don't need a ventilator it was an oxygen issue and this came to me from several medical doctors.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TigerlillySusan @Annlyn85501308 @taekicks @RealBridgeypooh @united When you consider over 4 billion dollars was paid out in the vaccine injury and compensation courts, that should stun you.

<|startoftext|>@Kevin_McKernan @JamesCasciano4 You don't have to be a doctor. I just mean more of a science version of it. I never finished my PhD in Public Health Research, either. I managed to get four degrees without debt and I wasn't about to go into debt lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone RT this. I've been asking this for months and they never reply. This is a serious legal question. @delta cleared me to fly without a mask.

<|startoftext|>@JamesCasciano4 @Kevin_McKernan A colleague and I were thinking about joining our own version of the frontline doctors. I know the frontline doctors! We're trying to come up with frontline IH and OHS personnel if you're ever interested, let me know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesCasciano4 @Kevin_McKernan Isn't is just insanity! This is the issue at hand. The use of masks and respirators isn't new and some people think it's a new topic and new science. They don't realize there is a profession that specializes in this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KJ_freedom13 @kayleighmcenany I'm not really sure what you mean by that, would you mind elaborating so I can respond better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SdotKdot756 It's more of  admitting I could have handled it better, because when I am disappointed in myself, I feel acknowledging it shows personal growth. I just need to remind myself I know what I do for a living and I know what my credentials are, and it's pointless to respond deniers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kayleighmcenany there are many studies on this and if you go on the world Health organization site it tells you not to work out in masks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmilyPetro22 @CopelandCole3 @kayleighmcenany Yes people do cardio in masks. It's required here. You can't work out at the gym without wearing them, in Michigan. We've had student athletes fall out so, they had to dial back a little bit on the mask issue and come up with alternatives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frogfromroc Also, I'm so sorry that your son missed soccer season.  I know that is a huge mental health escape for many children and teens. I also pulled my girls from their sports and they were not upset about it because they did not want to wear masks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frogfromroc I put together a paper on it that  I co write with a colleague that we give to attorneys, Icould email it to you, If you would like to message me your email. It's unsafe and even the WHO says children shouldn't even be jumping in masks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I apologise for allowing myself to debate against an adhominem attack w/ a nurse. She called me a fraud &amp; crook,  took me in a little sarcastic direction I should not have entertained. I get tired masks/respirators being new to some, when it's been 18yrs for me. I'll do better‚ô•Ô∏è<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Quinnwhite1234 @nicky_1936 @kayleighmcenany I know you can't present a time when you had to deal with discrimination or injury illness related to a mask mandate, because it's never occurred in the history of ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Quinnwhite1234 @nicky_1936 @kayleighmcenany If you've never dealt with cases related to the failure or use of incorrect PPE, then you have no leg to stand o.  I don't care if you're an attorney. If you don't specialize in this field, then please stay in your lane. Getting tired of people spreading disinformation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KJ_freedom13 @kayleighmcenany When you have doctors who are having their medical licenses taken away because they won't force their staff to wear masks you can imagine the fear for people in my career field that work for hospitals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KJ_freedom13 @kayleighmcenany I get the phone calls and emails when the bad things happen, as I am one of the few people in my career field that's not afraid of getting fired, to help.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Quinnwhite1234 @nicky_1936 @kayleighmcenany I guess an analogy to kind of understand the whole subject matter expert thing better is someone may drive a car for 30 years, but that doesn't mean they understand all the components of the car and how it's made and serviced.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Quinnwhite1234 @nicky_1936 @kayleighmcenany Well in the world of science, opinion is not fact. I don't mean that in a rudely. Here's a screenshot from an Apple from a occupational safety and health professional saying the same thing.  https://t.co/nch7Qd0gec<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DanielCPage @kayleighmcenany Do you need another professional from my field to say it.   https://t.co/kDe6GpR6uQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SdotKdot756 @taekicks @Freedum_DUH You're my favorite late night Twitter buddy haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KJ_freedom13 @kayleighmcenany or think that working in a sterile and controlled healthcare environment is the same thing as telling a construction worker they need to wear a mask in 85 degree heat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taekicks It wasn't censored, my phone froze as I was trying to hit post. I had a call come in as I was trying to hit save. I'll do it again tomorrow, but I'll condense it. I will also do it better because I know what I want to cover and don't want to cover. Shorter! Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DLlamafarm @AllieBsn @EforEnlightened @kayleighmcenany it really does suck and I probably could have handled myself better and I will fully admit that, but I get really upset when someone calls me a fraud in a crook when all I do is actually donate my time to help people for free. I ran out of Indica gummies lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flutina @kayleighmcenany Also, not all medical professionals get cleared to wear a mask as not everyone can tolerate doing so. also if you're referring to surgical masks those are masks and not respirators but they are only for bacteria and not viruses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flutina @kayleighmcenany Please understand that doctors are medically cleared to wear their N95s and 99s. They work in climate controlled environments and have engineering controls in place to help them breath better through ASHRAE standards. They're also acclimatized.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My live didn't save! I'll condense it in the morning, wait, maybe after my Bears game haha.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Freedum_DUH She blocked me so she did me a favor, I guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieBsn blocked me. I just went live to explain to her what I do  and she doesn't want to hear it. Notice she won't admit she doesn't understand masks and respirators on the level that I do. Even when I reach out to have a peaceful resolution with her. I tried. üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CopelandCole3 @AcerIhr @jamie_reinhold @kayleighmcenany Doctors and nurses are not credentialed to say such a thing and I'm about to explain that on video, live.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieBsn @Scorpio_KlNG @kayleighmcenany @RodinRealLife @OSHA_DOL I'm involved in several lawsuits against OSHA because they are guilty of revisionism and violating their own 1910.132. In addition to 1910.134. many of my colleagues work for OSHA and are trying to find other jobs so they can leave because they can't believe what OSHA is doing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GigiBowman @AllieBsn @Scorpio_KlNG @kayleighmcenany @TheRealDeanRyan @richardursomd You know I've dealt with my fair share of trolls over the years except in this situation I'm dealing with a healthcare provider who's actually harming other people by spreading disinformation and calling me a crook.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RodinRealLife @AllieBsn @Scorpio_KlNG @kayleighmcenany I normally don't but I normally don't have nurses arguing with me on Twitter calling me a crook and a fraud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Prosper78662542 @kayleighmcenany PPE is always viewed as a last resort so if all other control options don't control the hazard you would need something called the papr or a capr. The TV shows Grey's Anatomy and The Good Doctor, both show their staff wearing them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RodinRealLife @AllieBsn @Scorpio_KlNG @kayleighmcenany I'm about to on video<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieBsn @EforEnlightened @kayleighmcenany well I decided I'm going to go live so tune in because I'm going to talk about you and I'm going to do it in my PJs right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieBsn @EforEnlightened @kayleighmcenany Okay so now I have a health care worker calling an expert in the field of occupational safety and health who is a senior industrial hygienist, a crook. Now I need to politely ask you to tread lightly because you're walking into some legal territory. @RestoreFreedomK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieBsn @EforEnlightened @kayleighmcenany I'm not throwing around acronyms like OSHA and talking about joint commission.  I'm credentialed in getting hospitals accredited through the joint commission. Please go find an industrial hygienist or an OSH or ESH person in your hospital, they can explain it to you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieBsn @BarryMcCock6_9 @kayleighmcenany  https://t.co/2igJazteca<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieBsn @BarryMcCock6_9 @kayleighmcenany I think the issue here is you don't understand my profession. If you did understand my profession you would understand what I'm saying and why I don't need to work for the government to do my job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieBsn @BarryMcCock6_9 @kayleighmcenany You think all industrial hygienists are OHS professionals work for OSHA. I work for the federal government for 12 years. do you know that probably 95% of people my profession don't work for the government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhispersAngel I think the issue is people think talking about the limitations of masks and what proper Controls need to be in place, to protect against a virus, is medical advice. While my career field is a form of preventive health, we protect healthcare workers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RodinRealLife @AllieBsn @Scorpio_KlNG @kayleighmcenany Trust me, Nate and I are lying in bed right now because people do this all the time when they can't respond arguing the science and they just go after you personally. I just can't sleep the past couple days so Twitter has been my go-to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RodinRealLife @AllieBsn @Scorpio_KlNG @kayleighmcenany But hot rod, apparently I'm not who I say I am so that means you and I never worked together. That means you were never my boss at one time. Everything is make believe.ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieBsn @kayleighmcenany You're putting scientist on the front lines in air quotes. I have 100% disability rating through the VA because of what I dealt with during my time in the military. I've worked on the front lines for many years dealing with infectious diseases you may have never even heard of.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieBsn @kayleighmcenany Run own consulting business now. That's how many people in my field operate. I use to work as an embedded employee in VA Hospitals and large companies in Chicago, but because of having a second child, I decided to drop make a change so I could relocate to my home state.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieBsn @Scorpio_KlNG @kayleighmcenany I've managed OSHA's respiratory protection program for over 75,000 people and tested well over 10,000 masks and respirators, that's not a lie.  @RodinRealLife Please get a load of this nurse who says I'm not an industrial hygienist and I'm lying about who I am. Whoa lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieBsn @Scorpio_KlNG @kayleighmcenany Would someone with no credentials be speaking alongside the frontline doctors at an event?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieBsn @Scorpio_KlNG @kayleighmcenany I had to screenshot this one because you just stated I have no credentials. That is epic. Okay now I have to recruit some people on this thread. @TheRealDeanRyan @GigiBowman @richardursomd   Did you guys hear that, I have no credentials.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieBsn @kayleighmcenany Do you realize all your arguments are your own assumptions. I never said I worked for OSHA nor the joint commission. You're required to follow OSHA standards in your job so should everyone assume that you work for OSHA?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieBsn @kayleighmcenany Are you at work right now I'm just curious I don't really know anyone else that's usually up at 3:00 a.m. other than me. Just curious since the hospital should be overflowing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieBsn @Scorpio_KlNG @kayleighmcenany Why are you sharing a link to a physics girl that has nothing to do with me. You really are trying to discredit me but you don't take away my degrees or certifications. You're actually disrespecting my experience amd my credentials.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieBsn @Scorpio_KlNG @kayleighmcenany When did I ever say I worked for OSHA. I was once offered a job with OSHA, I declined it. I spent 9 years on active duty and I've worked in my field for 18 years. You don't have to work for OSHA to be an industrial hygienist. Yes, I helped with joint commission accreditation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieBsn @kayleighmcenany Ad hominem attacks usually occur when people can't fight back with actual evidence or science or intellectual response.I don't know why you can't just admit you're not an expert when it comes to occupational safety and health or industrial hygiene.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieBsn @kayleighmcenany Why are you saying I'm not an expert. Do you realize how disrespectful to my profession that is. how on Earth am I credentialed as an expert witness in court and why have I donated so many hours towards helping people in court.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieBsn @kayleighmcenany Don't worry I don't mean that is up I'm going to share it on Facebook I think that's wrong for people to share private information like that. I just want to teach you who runs your respiratory protection program so maybe you can sit down and talk with them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieBsn @kayleighmcenany Nice try though .That's an old website where someone pretends to be me. It's old news from like seven or eight years ago. I did find your employer, by the way, so I'm going to find out who he runs your respiratory protection program.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieBsn @kayleighmcenany Nope, that is not me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Prosper78662542 @kayleighmcenany I don't need to buy my own plane because Delta allows me to fly without a mask because I have a well-documented disability that does not allow me to wear one. Also, my heart goes out to anyone that has died from this illness but these masks can't stop the virus. Per NIOSH ratings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteJMcGill @CaptainYesz @justin_hart @kayleighmcenany  https://t.co/R8l4z3tqta  This explains it best and it's an easy read.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteJMcGill @CaptainYesz @justin_hart @kayleighmcenany required by OSHA &amp; then I review it for any indicators that I feel an occ health doc  needs to review for either an interview or a full physical. Sometimes, pulmonary function testing too, depending on what they're wearing it for and under what tasks and climate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erin841984 @united Thank you. I try to be peaceful &amp; kind, but sometimes people anger me when they go after children &amp; I get really tired of HCWs who are not credentialed in occupational safety and health that give advice &amp; try to tell me that I'm incorrect, when it's my career field &amp; I train HCWs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erin841984 @united I would never encourage anyone to lie about a disability, but you have an honest &amp; legal right to say you have health reasons not to wear them. Those health reasons are they not rated to protect you against the virus &amp; they can decrease oxygen &amp; spread bacteria. They're facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erin841984 @united I have an ADA Title III protected disability so I don't have to wear one. I wear a lanyard that says I am a legally protected disabled veteran and I can't mask and please don't ask. I am very calm if anyone has an issue. I don't usually have any issues....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteJMcGill @CaptainYesz @justin_hart @kayleighmcenany If you would like to see an example of this questionnaire just look up 29 CFR 1910.134 appendix C.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteJMcGill @CaptainYesz @justin_hart @kayleighmcenany Yes they have to fill out a medical questionnaire for me and have a medical clearance to see if they can even wear a respirator that long. They also have other controls in place to help them wear them, like proper climate controls under ASHRAE standards. They do get headaches.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1HOTTOY @SashGirlVegas @CaptainYesz @justin_hart @kayleighmcenany I believe this because I have a lot of attorneys calling me to act as an expert witness in cases where employees were forced to wear masks and were not trained on when to change them out, and they did contract bacterial pneumonia. Recently, a four-year-old girl almost died .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieBsn @kayleighmcenany Don't wear a mask because it makes you touch your face more and causes cross-contamination and self-contamination and don't work for Covid. The hierarchy of safety and controls should be followed. You have negative and positive pressure rooms designed to deal with this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieBsn @EforEnlightened @kayleighmcenany I don't know why you're calling me stupid. You don't even know what my degrees are in and you don't know my credentials. I spent nine years on active duty training for pandemics and health hazards and how to control them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EforEnlightened @AllieBsn @kayleighmcenany The substance is literally the entire OSHA standard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieBsn @kayleighmcenany I'm a voluntaryist, not a Republican.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blodgetbridge I don't give medical advice, I give preventive health information related to ensuring people have a right to a safe &amp; healtful work environment that the average lay person is understanding the limitations of specific PPE as that is my career field. I've tested over 10K masks.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@blodgetbridge @kayleighmcenany You should care about my profession because I am qualified to tell people not to wear masks because it gives an illusion of protection. They're not rated to stop a virus in either direction. It's also dangerous to not train people on them and they house so much bacteria.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blodgetbridge @kayleighmcenany I actually am credentialed. I'm even credentialed as an expert witness in court to talk about this. HCWs should be using proper engineering and admin controls. When working in direct contact with infectious disease patients, weae PAPR's and CAPR's. My profession acts as the SMEs<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AllieBsn @wizard2416 @kayleighmcenany I've worked in infection control units. I sat on infection control committees and trained those doctors on what to wear and when.

<|startoftext|>@CopelandCole3 @AcerIhr @jamie_reinhold @kayleighmcenany How many of those people were masks and died and had no comorbidities. fraction that you can't produce these numbers therefore you cannot have any calculated outcomes. What we do know is no one is wearing masks that are rated to protect against this virus. Per NIOSH.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/Sns887MxIS  A colleague of mine recently posted:   Remember, Doctors treat you and OSH Professionals protect you.

<|startoftext|>@AllieBsn @kayleighmcenany I'm not saying do nothing.

<|startoftext|>@Scorpio_KlNG @AllieBsn @kayleighmcenany Why is my profession in air quotes?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieBsn @kayleighmcenany I would love to follow you around in a non-stalker way so I could point out how many times you probably touch your mask and don't change it out. Which if you did in a healthcare setting, I could write you up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieBsn @kayleighmcenany It's funny when I was training people on how masks don't work alongside a medical doctor who he was bringing up the good point that not a single person has ever seen what a virus looks like. The point is the fire on and micron sizes so small you don't catch it on film.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieBsn @kayleighmcenany I'm still waiting for you to tell me who manages the respiratory protection program in the healthcare facility that you work at. I'm laughing out loud right now laying next to my husband who's a public health specialist. The fact you don't know about my profession haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieBsn @kayleighmcenany If people would understand the difference between micron sizes and particulates in aerosols like an industrial hygienist does, then maybe people would realize nurses are not credentialed to speak out about the usage and limitations associated with PPE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieBsn @wizard2416 @kayleighmcenany only large droplets can be stopped by these masks and infectious disease wards you do not wear anything but CAPRS and PAPRs I know because I manage this program in hospitals. Show me where NIOSH certified these masks for this hazard. Please stay in your lane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CopelandCole3 @LilithAssyria @kayleighmcenany This whole thing was filmed by the highwire, so when the video is released, I can send it your way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CopelandCole3 @LilithAssyria @kayleighmcenany What am I apparently lying about could you please elaborate so I can properly respond. The facts are I flew Delta with a mask metal exemption through their clear to fly program. I went with another colleague and a pediatrician to educate a private school about masks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieBsn @jamie_reinhold @kayleighmcenany Out of those 300,000 deaths how many of those people were wearing masks? Bacterial pneumonia is just so trendy huh. Strep throat is just so adorable. could you show me your respiratory protection trading slides that you use to train healthcare workers. I'll wait.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CopelandCole3 @jamie_reinhold @kayleighmcenany You should tell that to the people in Michigan who have gotten bacterial pneumonia from prolonged mass wearing and their medical doctors have informed them to stop wearing masks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CopelandCole3 @jamie_reinhold @kayleighmcenany You mean like this giant document or all of the RCT studies that show cross-contaminations and self-contamination and it's why OSHA law has always required health care workers to be trained on how to use them.  https://t.co/Fx7qPtFNId<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CopelandCole3 @CaptainYesz @justin_hart @kayleighmcenany They are, ask anyone in my career field. I have friends who are on their way into my career field &amp; can't even find basic citations that we've all used for decades. An example would be all the citations/ studies that we used to exclude pregnant HCWs from wearing respirators.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieBsn @BarryMcCock6_9 @kayleighmcenany He failed to mention he had to have a medical clearance to wear that, training and fit testing and he's working in an environment that's covered by ASHRAE standards.

<|startoftext|>Best thread on Masks 101:  Masks are being worn incorrectly.  Masks are not NIOSH certified to protect against viral transmission.  NIOSH certification requires that each type of mask be tested for transmission of different sized particles, including viruses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Old Navy is selling masks and this is on the back of the package. I obviously know all about mask and respirators, as it's my profession, but the irony of this is actually comical. Especially after what @united just did.  https://t.co/gK59XOcwjm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PoetryPatriot @RichardGrenell @united I actually test masks for a living and I've been in this game for 18 years. I took a picture of the back of a package of masks sold at @OldNavy Unless a device is certified by NIOSH, it will not do anything to protect you except spread bacteria.  https://t.co/ovCbHW5KR4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@legitbossprint @ViktoriiaUAH @united Please don't reproduce because you obviously are a fan of child abuse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anyone fully understand that pre-covid if a parent was doing this to their child and trying to force a mask on their face like this, they could be turned in for a child abuse. They can't make their child cover their face she was resisting it. My heart goes out to them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SoooTiffancy @united You just pointed out something very important. I am actually an expert on masks and the engineering controls through the ventilation are enough to control this hazard and the masks are not even rated to protect against the virus in either direction. They spread bacteria.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JD1982 @PaulStetson13 @donnahartyyz @elizfulop Someone doesn't have kids. I can't even keep a hair tie on my 5-year-old.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulStetson13 @firefire100 @donnahartyyz @elizfulop Incorrect, you can't spread something you have no symptoms for. Please explain any other time in history where we accuse people with no symptoms of spreading illnesses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulStetson13 @donnahartyyz @elizfulop Do you hear yourself, you're implying people need to train their children to cover their mouths and faces so they don't get in trouble. Sounds like a training camp for child abduction and molestation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donnahartyyz @elizfulop Highly incorrect. These rules violate so many laws and science. How is it I can fly Delta with my disability and not wear a mask. No on freaks out or kicks me off because Delta is aware and cleared me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wheeler4Nevada @UnitedAirlines I'm doing the same. I just need to figure out how to cash out or be compensated for all my miles. I spend a lot of my card too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@united can you explain why you're violating ADA Title III &amp; the Air Carriers Access Act. I am a Premier United member &amp; have not been able to fly because you disrespect &amp; violate my disability rights as a veteran. I can't even use my miles. I had no issue with Delta this week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieBsn @PinkieCLC @kayleighmcenany I am not a Republican and I don't think covid is a hoax. I personally think it's a blood issue and more likely resembles a bio weapon. Btw that was my wartime job in the AF CBRNE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaptainYesz @justin_hart @kayleighmcenany There are so many studies about oxygen content being impacted by mask wearing. A lot of neurologists have written studies on it and sadly Google is scrubbing all the data that I used to use everyday in my career field and can now only access through school research portals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kevin_McKernan Thank you for acknowledging my personal ideologies of freedom so many people don't know what voluntarianism is. Anytime I speak out about masks people assume I'm a Republican. Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kevin_McKernan I also just got back from Florida where I was with that same colleague and a well-known pediatrician to educate parents and teachers at a private school about the dangers associated with masks and their inability to protect against this virus. The highwire also filmed it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kevin_McKernan Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kevin_McKernan I am senior industrial hygienist of 18 years, I study aerosols and particulates. These masks are absolutely not capable of stopping this virus in either direction and they have no NIOSH certifications. Thank you for this thread, because it's opening eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LilithAssyria @kayleighmcenany Also I gave a presentation along with a colleague and a pediatrician about the dangers of wearing masks. During our presentation, a total of 9-10 people removed their masks that were religious mask wears. We presented facts and not our opinion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LilithAssyria @kayleighmcenany I wondered why I couldn't message you. Yes, @Delta cleared me to fly. I offered to wear my mouth shield, which I can tolerate, but I did not have to wear a mask.  No one said a word to me. It was an excellent experience that I had so much anxiety about and I'm glad it worked out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elizfulop Please reach out to me if you plan to take legal action, I will donate my time as an expert witness. I've tested well over 10,000 masks and respirators, over the past 18 years, as a senior industrial hygienist. Children should absolutely never be in masks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elizfulop If you take legal action, I will donate my time, for free, as an expert witness as to how masks are completely abusive and uncalled for. They are not rated to stop this virus. They should never be put on children. I've been in this career field for 18 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieBsn @kayleighmcenany Who do you think selects and orders all of your PPE and tests and implements all the engineering and admin controls.   Who do you think OSHA and the Joint Commission goes to first, when they show up on site.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieBsn @kayleighmcenany I'm a Scientist on the front lines making sure you all work safely and train you. I'm no fucking idiot. Why don't you ask your medical director who manages your respiratory protection program.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhispersAngel They were literally  asked to assault their own child.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nicoleanneliz @jgoneal @AnthonySabatini I worked in an occupational safety and health profession for 18 years, 12 of it was for the federal government.

<|startoftext|>@Stofka @Judgement84 Also, last I checked pants and shoes don't restrict oxygen content by up to 20%.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stofka @Judgement84 Can you please show me a single NIOSH rating on any of these masks that certify it as able to stop a virus in either direction. People who know masks do not do this aren't dicks. They just realize they are useless and spread bacteria.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@elbour @charliekirk11 The fact that you're asking me to get information about what masks can do to the human body, by people who are not credentialed to do so, ends this discussion. Industrial Hygienist are the SMEs on this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaredmcomber @charliekirk11 Yes, through fomite transmission.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 Because they can cause self and cross contamination and foster an environment full of bacteria. It lowers oxygen content and impedes proper gaseous exchanges which causes domino effect. They are not rated by NIOSH to stop this virus in other direction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gregkellyusa These masks are not rated by NIOSH. They give the illusion of  Protection. Their self and cross contamination they can cause is a major issue. I've been testing masks and studying aerosols as an Industrial Hygienist for 18yrs. Also a Veteran.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NYSpawts @BillNye The video where he talks about the mask trapping the virus....

<|startoftext|>@yesimthat1guy @BillNye It's because ASP/CSP are safety pros. They deal w/ physical hazards like slip, trips, &amp; falls. Industrial Hygienists deal w/ health hazards.

Do you know who trains doctors and tells them what types of controls they must put into place and what mask or respirator to wear. This is highly incorrect! Do not don a mask for covid-19. Shirkey, this is just plain wrong!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> https://t.co/SWuFqy9Cse  My discussion with my friend and co-host Sean Stone @WatchingSean   Have you considered the spiritual aspect of what is going on with Covid 19 and masks. We dive deep and discuss different angles of what many are overlooking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IlluminatiEyes My indica edible is about to kick in, so I'm going to screenshot this so I remember it in the morning to get back to you haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IlluminatiEyes It's not that simple I mean I'm talking about 30 years of research and18 years of experience but.... let me think of the best one-stop shop for you, until then, look up BMJ open mask studies because those are some that were done during the H1N1 outbreak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IlluminatiEyes @ROHIRRIM_RONIN You really have to look into how the studies are done because there's actually guidelines on how you test the limitations and the efficacy of masks and respirators. It really is as simple as saying if it's not rated to protect you against a virus by NIOSH It's no bueno<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IlluminatiEyes I get it, I mean a lot of people don't even know about my career field and have never heard about it, but masks and respirators has been a part of my job since 2002. When the media is saying one thing, I completely get why the public is confused.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IceQueen1960 @teuta4u1 @FoxNews Saving lives is the whole purpose of my profession. They don't reduce numbers they increase the numbers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimDohe48826526 @ChuckUFarly2169 @pfschuyler Maybe you should research my career field. Our whole entire job is to study and implement health-related controls, including masks and respirators. Even the OSHA law defines us as the subject matter experts on the issue. You're not familiar with my job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IlluminatiEyes Just follow me, it's my profession. #Unmaskamerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scrowder @therealroseanne @Timcast Hmmm, interesting what I stumbled upon. Let's take special note of the April numbers, ya know, when @GovWhitmer put covid positive patients in nursing homes. Why are business failing? Suicides? All of this fear porn! #MasksDontWork  https://t.co/pVyk6XAsw1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MandieCrain @Timcast @scrowder Which part. I'm in between Grand Rapids and Holland.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@queenalmamarie I hope you all had a wonderful Thanksgiving and enjoyed family. Strength and mental health is a strength in our immune function.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Drewcifer__ @zakksnave @Timcast @scrowder I don't even understand what you just said. This is my field of specialty. You can't even wash the masks at home unless you're doing it with a medical grade temperature and cleaner. The average person is not laundering these mass correctly nor are they changing them out correctly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxNews If you consult with an industrial hygienist, oh wait, I am one... you would learn at these masks do nothing but cause self and cross-contamination and are not rated to protect against this virus and have no NIOSH approval to do so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@teuta4u1 @FoxNews I am a subject matter expert in respiratory protection which includes masks and respirators They are causing more of the spread and they are not rated to protect against the virus That's why people need to take them off immediately ask any industrial hygienist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Drewcifer__ @zakksnave @Timcast @scrowder That analogy is irrelevant when you're applying it to the fact that more people that were masks are sicker because that's actually true masks can cause respiratory infections because of the amount of bacteria they house.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Drewcifer__ @Timcast @scrowder I am telling people not to wear a mask because they are not ready to protect them against the virus and they house millions of bacteria on the inside and outside of the mask and people are not trained on how to wash them or wear them or when they dispose or change them out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scrowder @GovWhitmer  is citing EPIDEMIOLOGISTS about masks. Newsflash! It is Industrial Hygienists you need to cite. Please go to any large company that has an OSHA written respiratory protection program and tell me if an epidemiologist manages it, you won't! She's a dumbass ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckUFarly2169 @TimDohe48826526 @pfschuyler I would really like all these people that don't understand that industrial hygienists are the subject matter experts here, to go to any large employer and ask for their written respiratory protection program and see who manages it. IHs and (EHS folks with extra training).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimDohe48826526 @ChuckUFarly2169 @pfschuyler I'm not trying to be rude, but it's evident that you don't understand who are the subject matter experts and health-related PPE, it's industrial hygienists... No epidemiologists!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@frogsinspace I heard one Dem testify that he thinks this is all BS and that people are confused because the room was hot that day at TCF and they went in looking for fraud, so they view it all as fraud. Apparently, it's not fraud, it's just human errors. Lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afrokarma @CarlosSimancas Even if I got tested I wouldn't know if I had it now or a year ago because the PCR tests are not capable of finding out if you are actively infected. With a 99% recovery rate I'm not worried about it. Everyone that I know that has had it, has said it's easier than the flu.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afrokarma @CarlosSimancas They change out their masks every 2 hours and are trained on their use. I manage their programs.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AmericanGentile @MdTeryn Yes, N95, which is the point I was making. Any "device" that is used to stop small particulates must be fit tested and NIOSH approved to do so. Cloth, ear loop and surgical masks are not for to the face.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MdTeryn The risk of self and cross contamination is very high. The public is not trained on change out nor on fit factors and protection factors. Aside from the drop in O2 and impeding proper gaseous exchanges, these masks are not even rated by NIOSH.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Kanganator @DerLader @carriecoon You may want to look up who the SMEs are in healh related PPE.

<|startoftext|>@waynespar @carriecoon Well we all know, well most people should know, that the PCR tests are only 50% reliable because you can't tell if it's active or historical. Just watch the NFL players who test positive one day and negative the next.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@K18352817 This is not a study of the efficacy of masks and respirators against the micron size of covid-19. NIOSH approves PPE for certain use. This involves so many parameters. I will see if I can type of those parameters into a screen shot so I can fit it in a tweet.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GoodCitizenGa1 @nypost are you aware of how much fraud was uncovered here Michigan and how many affidavits from employees and poll watchers, on both sides of the aisle, witnessed fraud. The right thing to do is refuse to certify until there's an investigation.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Joffan7 @MaMoMVPY @davey1233 @berlingske I'm a subject matter expert regarding masks and respirators and non NIOSH rated devices do not act as Protection against this virus. I've been saying this since March.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If you need another reference from an additional subject matter expert in PPE, I highly recommend watching TL Peters explain why masks do not work against Covid-19.   https://t.co/PiWcEkEW58<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DalJeanis @MediaGL1 I linked so many studies and videos in the thread. The easiest one to understand regarding differences in facial coverings and what they can and cannot do it by a friend of mine who teaches... https://t.co/PiWcEkEW58<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DalJeanis @MediaGL1 With all the respect, you kind of have to understand what it's like to have 18 years of knowledge and experience and science at your fingertips and being in the field actually implementing this PPE and studying it and then being asked to put it into twitter size characters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ztobitcoin @LiquorElixir No, it proves my point. In fact go buy the supplies yourself. We did particulate/toxicology aerosol studies throughout my career. Why do you think surgical masks are not rated to protect against a virus for HCWs &amp; OSHA law? ACGIH, NIOSH....  https://t.co/eAlTkKpXO8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiquorElixir @ztobitcoin The people who test masks aren't the people who put our that article. To test the limitations &amp; give masks/respirators protection factors it's an extensive process. I can spend prob 5 mins &amp; tie that article to a mask benefactor. Been happening slot lately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/vuYoW2u5uY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiquorElixir @ztobitcoin Surgical masks protect from large droplets like spit, not against a virus. They are used to stop the spread of bacterial infections around open wounds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DalJeanis @MediaGL1 No mask is safer because the masks does nothing but cause self and cross contamination and false sense of security. Not wearing one doesn't further the spread through fomite transmission. It allows for proper gaseous exchanges and proper immune function.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DalJeanis @MediaGL1 It shows cloth masks filter around 0%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DalJeanis @MediaGL1 There is mounting evidence that exists since 1979. I can. Link all the data in tweets. There is a reason 29 CFR 1910.134 exists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ztobitcoin @LiquorElixir Think running sand through a strainer mixed with jello. Yes, sand can attach to the jello, but much of the sand will still run right through the strainer, as a fast rate of movement. I'm just trying to give you a visual.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LiquorElixir @ztobitcoin I read the whole study, it does not reveal cloth masks nor surgical masks as being able to stop this virus in either direction. This is why masks and respirators MUST be NIOSH approved. People must be trained on their use and limitations. Huge false sense of security.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@k3k3tz @grrosegr A virus can attach to larger size particulates.

<|startoftext|>@Nubiantrojan As a Gator fan, I'd rather draft Trask.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wrestlinggirl48 @Svg_Snowman @NFLonFOX I don't think Trubisky sucks. He has us undefeated and he can escape the pocket and run when needed. Foles always acts like a scared statue. I was angry when they signed himz before he even played.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RussellDuren Sorry, I've been a die hard fan for 30yrs and I'm angry at my Govenor and this loss of wins and individual liberty is really holding anger in my head lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wrestlinggirl48 @Svg_Snowman @NFLonFOX Trubisky isn't the issue, the okay calling was.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wrestlinggirl48 @Svg_Snowman @NFLonFOX We have a bye week and then GB. They better being Mitch back and I hope we win and then fire everyone that put Foles on our team. I knew he was awful even before he even put the jersey on.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EazzyDuzzzIT @themessageman07 @NFLonFOX Yeah we were fucked the second Foles was our starter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheJalenReport We were undefeated and doing fine until Foles room over. Many, many Bears fans can't stand him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@THEMAYLEMAN Only Foles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawindycityP I just need to not type because it's going to come out wrong, but I've been rooting for Tyler Bray to start.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I never celebrate an injury, so don't take this wrong, but Foles down may be the only way to save our season where we were on track to the SB. Can't stand Foles as our starter. I hope he heals, but I also hope he is bumped down to 3rd string QB.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JocelynBenson Wow, you are so incredibly blind. How in the hell do you deny poll watchers were denied access, we had dead voters, software "glitches" and a whooooole bunch of affidavits. You're just gonna ignore all those?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ch47fixer The airborne particulates are what cause the spread. They stay airborne in ambient air.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_birgetta_ The masks themselves are not designed nor rated to stop the virus because of the micron size of covid-19. Even if they were rated to stop the virus, training is required because of the whole touching and fomite transmission issue.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rlayton27 You're exactly right and that's an aspect that as industrial hygienist, I study. Major kudos and props to the doctors who come forward and admit that they know industrial hygienists and EHS personnel are the ones that train them on their PPE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RussellDuren Non credentialed hahahaha epic. What type of safety stuff do you do? Construction? One of my M.S. is OSH. I did Construction and General Safety, but IH is my main gig.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ztobitcoin Surgical masks are for large droplets, spit and a temporary barrier for splashes. For viruses and airborne particulates, I put HCWs in either N95s or PAPRs, depending on their exposures and engineering and admin controls in place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For all those following this thread I'm about to upload a podcast I did with another PPE expert and it's a good one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GobeDavy Actually, they can increase viral load because they don't allow you to exhale gaseous waste. This is why there's a mask change out and respirator change out in healthcare settings they can only wear them for so long before they can cause self-contamination.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BasedHobbit @FairwayFever @NoomDynamite Right!  It seems the days of civil discussions and debates no longer exist I usually get called a few names lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FinancialHe Sure have. All done over the past 18yrs. I'm a Senior Industrial Hygienist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billy_libert @grrosegr Ear loop masks, cloth masks and surgical masks are not designed nor rated to stop the spread of this virus. We don't even need respiratory Protection as citizens. This is a virus that has a 99.97% recovery rate. Just utilized universal precautions and eat healthy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peacock_matt23 @jimcramer Nothing fake about it. The use of what PPE to wear for viruses has been around since 1979. This data isn't new.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesTodaroMD  https://t.co/igcrRh1USa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesTodaroMD  https://t.co/PiWcEkEW58<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesTodaroMD you can find information that exposes masks on my timeline. I am a Sr. Industrial Hygienist. I. Sure you're familiar with my profession as we train HCWs on controls.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/vuYoW2u5uY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThomasEWoods  this goes right along with your recent email about virus mitigation efforts not working. Hmmmmm. I explain why...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mallon_khan This isn't about freedom issues, it's science. Certain countries use masks ever since H1N1 and some now even wear them as a form of fashion. They don't stop this virus. Many in China already wore masks if they worked why the outbreak? This is my field of expertise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mallon_khan I want to make sure I'm understanding you correctly are you trying to come from the angle that people that don't wear masks don't care about other people?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Judgement84 imagine being in this career field for almost 20 years and wondering where the hell OSHA is and why they're being weaponized It's just like the EPA allowing oil spills and not doing a damn thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oliver1953 If you fear this virus just please remember it has a 99.97% recovery rate. You can boost your immune system by eating a cleaner diet and you can avoid large gatherings without the government telling you and just wash your hands and stay hydrated and increase vitamin A,C,D &amp; zinc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oliver1953 Anaya's approved respirator would be the N95 but in order to use an N95 you have to be clean shaven have a medical clearance and be fit tested. Even in 95s still can allow the small micron size of the specific virus to go through them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@quenjpg @StoneyBitson I have provided the alternative The alternative is not to wear one and just wash your hands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mallon_khan No actually you don't need anything because you're not working in close contact with infectious disease patients and let's not forget that this virus has a 99.97% recovery rate. Airplanes have really good filtration systems built in As an engineering control.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pangyre @grrosegr The ACGIH Even came out and said even if you knew how to put your mask on right the second you touch it or take it off wrong, you are causing self and cross contamination.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MediaGL1 While this whole masks issue and their capabilities and limitations seem new to some, it's been an issue in my field for   30 years. Cloth masks cannot and do not stop the spread of this virus, it actually increases the spread.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindleyART I would start by searching bmj open mask studies. Look into how NIOSH certifies PPE AND 29CFR 1910.134<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me and Tammy Clark   https://t.co/igcrRh1USa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is TL Peters...   https://t.co/PiWcEkEW58<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, the only other professionals in my field not scared to call out these dangerous recommendations... It seems to only be those who also work for themselves or have their own businesses. We don't fear being fired for telling the truth. I will link two interviews...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MediaGL1 Unless you're wearing a respirator that has a NIOSH rating to protect you against a virus, no your cloth mask/ear loop mask are not going to stop the virus. While it may trap a chunk of phlegm, the airborne particulates will stay ambient. Don't cough inside the masks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoomDynamite No, because the particulates go straight through the masks. This is all part of the 10K tests I have conducted and it's why NIOSH approves certain PPE for certain situations and they have both Fit Factors and Protection Factors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobbieVdg Hahaha look at this  https://t.co/vfoEIVb2IC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oliver1953 Absofreakinlutely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LibertarianCarG And actually if someone is ill they shouldn't be wearing it because they can increase their viral load and prolong the time in which they would be able to fight off the infection, because they would just be causing further self-contamination.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mallon_khan That's what healthcare workers working around infectious disease patients. They should be wearing PAPR's or supplied air respirators. This is a Snapchat I took #GreysAnatomy has it right.  https://t.co/GAqUtm15WF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoomDynamite Think metal spaghetti strainer: It is going to allow the noodles to stay inside it, but the water is still passing through. This is exactly how large droplets are able to be stopped by facial covering, but the smaller particulates, which are more airborne, still go right through<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MJ2070 I would encourage people to change their diets to strengthen their immune systems, to wash their hands &amp; be mindful of touching their face &amp; surfaces in between hand washes. You can't escape a virus no matter what you do We have to learn to live w/ this and it has a 1% death rate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MJ2070 The first thing I would do is I would say do not attempt to use your own homemade masks or masks not rated to protect you against a virus. That alone, is causing self/cross contamination and is the biggest issue in spreading a virus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MJ2070 Being serious here: it's like people coming on TV, saying to practice safe sex, cover their penis &amp; then you have people using saran wrap as a condom. We all know you have to be trained on how to put a condom on &amp; how to properly take it off &amp; be made of proper material....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MJ2070 First, we have to clarify that this is not a pandemic. We're dealing with a RNA mutating virus that has a less than 1% death rate. We should be implementing training on the heiarchy of safety and controls.     Engineering and admin controls should be utilized...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BuckJudo @VeritasSola last night the director of our Health and Human services touched his mask seven times while standing at the podium, and then touched the podium and the mic. I cannot with these people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoomDynamite Surgeons wear masks to stop large droplets and splatter. They are to aid in preventing bacterial infections.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grrosegr They don't stop the virus in either direction, meaning you can still inhale and exhale the virus because the micron size is way too small, goes right through the material, and that's why anyone wearing any form of PPE against a virus needs to have a NIOSH rating attached to it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AutomatedUtopia N95s are actually not masks, they are actually respirators governed under 29 CFR 1910.134  In infectious disease wards, I actually put HCWs in something called supplied air or power to air purifying respirators.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BuckJudo @VeritasSola I recently saw a guy drop his ear loop mask on the ground walking into a grocery store. He picked it up off the ground then wore inside out.  All of the contaminants on the outside of the mask were just completely inhaled via self-contamination.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mallon_khan Surgeons wear those masks, not NIOSH rated against a virus to stop large droplets from contaminating the surgical setting. When they are around infectious disease patients they wear PAPRs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neonfog Please explain, but please explain after you look up who are the subject matter experts when it comes to health related PPE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joeymrtnz A bitch? You mean a Scientist that specializes in  Health related PPE and is also disabled?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FYI masks DO NOT WORK. This is my field of experience as a Sr. Industrial Hygienist. I've tested over 10K masks/respirators. These mandates are not involving feedback from people in my career field. Non NIOSH rated facial coverings do nothing but cause self &amp; cross contamination.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Costco As a disabed Vet, I have a med exemption for all facial coverings. As a PPE expert, you need to know shields/masks do nothing to protect against a virus in either direction.

<|startoftext|>@Indy_De_tweets @ChicagoBears Of course I know about our O Line! I don't care about the opponents pass rush. When the QB has the ability to sprint out of the pocket, you let him. We currently have a guy I can outrun and I am a fully disabled veteran.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What more will it take to drop Foles? I knew since the day he was the starter we would tank.   I've been a @ChicagoBears  fan for 30 yrs. I'm not down with this support all Bears mindset. We have a QB and coach who refuse to admit the mistake of starting Foles!!  #TitanUp #Bears<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawindycityP Are more fans actually going to start to admit Foles needs to go. At this point, put in Bray. Foles needs to go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawindycityP I don't think the whole team sucks. I think certain individuals do and I also think that the communication is awful between the team because the caliber of players we have is good. There is a disconnect between the play calling and other issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawindycityP I still can't get over the play where Foles actually ran it but had Patterson wide open and unmanned.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WordFragments @MattFinnFNC I'm not sure if you saw everything I posted but the video is from a Texas attorney who was there and the one who filmed it. There are many attorneys in Michigan who documented fraud.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Quackarazzi @AlexBerenson These masks are not NIOSH rated and cannot stop this virus in either direction. Once again, experts on Health related PPE are Industrial Hygienists, NO OTHER CAREER FIELD! Per OSHA and the courts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Quackarazzi @AlexBerenson Who do you think trains Infectious diseases doctors and nurses, IHs do!

<|startoftext|>@Quackarazzi @AlexBerenson Health care workers are not subject matter experts when it comes to health related PPE, industrial hygienists are and I've been one for 18 years.

<|startoftext|>@jcxrew @DawindycityP Leaders sacrifice, they don't run sideways and scared when there is a straight route to gain atleast 4 yrds. I'm 38 and have been a Bears fan since age 8. I've never seen this, not even with Cutler.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawindycityP #startmitch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawindycityP Yes he would have. Foles is a scared little bitch. I have no nicer nor professional way to say it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JJStankevitz Remember when we had a quarterback who could leave the pocket and run it himself if needed.... Oh yeah that's right he's standing on the sidelines, while chicken legs is making huge mistakes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some of us have known it wasn't Mitch this whole time, it was the damn calls and lack of protection. #putmitchin #trubisky #chicagobears<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawindycityP Yuuuup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawindycityP We need this win and we can't watch him break down. Even if you put Mitch in for just a couple snaps, to get him clear his head. I don't care if we break protocol. We have two QBs that are pretty much on the same level, but one has legs and can break out of the pocket.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawindycityP Put in Mitch put in Mitch put in Mitch put in Mitch put in Mitch!   we're usually a second half team and now we're going backwards and it's his f****** fault.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawindycityP So no foul on the other player who finger fucked Miller's face?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spartan_sports9 More nervous than a missed period after prom.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@zooropean Exactly, it was a dirty call by Nagy to circumvent the GM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zooropean Nagy and Foles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawindycityP So........ At what point will people realize Foles sucks ass. Please cut him. I've been sying this since the day he started.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zooropean yep because I've been a bears fan since I could f****** walk and I see a s***** quarterback when I see a s***** quarterback and Nick Foles is not our hero<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the Chicago Bears do not fucking put @Mtrubisky10 back in over Nick Foles I am going to lose my shit. How stupid do you have to be to not see the issue here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawindycityP Yes our O line could step upbut the overthrown balls by foles and the fear in his eyes is not a leadership role, Truisky would have ran that shit. I'm done making excuses for this weiner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fall3nWarrior23 Exactly, at least he can run the ball and he doesn't overthrow it like a f****** moron<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fall3nWarrior23 He's not and I've been livid since the day he was the starter.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DawindycityP I know you're disagree with me I don't f****** care I've been a bears fan since I was 8 years old. We need to f****** put Trubisky back out and Nick Foles needs to go. Nagy must be high!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where are the #bears fans still defending Nagy and Foles. You can't throw the ball 2 fucking yards. Put Trubisky in now or can Folws and Nagy. I'm fucking tired of this shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've been a bears fan since I was 8 years old. I do not care what anyone says, I still cannot fathom why we put in Foles in over Trubisky.

<|startoftext|>@slammy99 @theweel1 @scrowder Who is my team, The Chicago Bears? I'm not a Democrat nor Republican. it's because I don't align with the political party that I'm able to speak without bias and only utilize the science that's existed since 1979.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slammy99 @scrowder I spent nine years on active duty and I fully understand what tyranny is and what our governor has done in our state is 100% tyrannical.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@raginggamer84 @votebluealways @scrowder I trained virologists and healthcare workers on which PPE to use &amp; when.

Not Drs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnRob69887811 @scrowder I can't speak for sociopaths. I think it's the mental idea that wearing a mask will protect you and others. The issue:  compare it to gloves. There are so many different types of gloves to be worn around different hazards w/ different breakthrough times. Lack of real information<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scrowder I live in MI under Whitmer's tyranny. When you spoke at our capital in Lansing, I was down in Austin, Texas at their Constitutional Rights Summit I spoke out about masks, alongside the Frontline Doctors.

<|startoftext|>@votebluealways @scrowder actually, I've tested well over 10,000 masks and managed the respiratory protection program for over 76,000 people and have 18 years experience. üòä<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scrowder I'm listening to the show this morning and I'm screaming I wish you could hear me because I am a PPE expert and specialize in respiratory protection and I've been exposing masks since last February!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LarryMayer Such BS. He had them at 2-0 and the defense didn't show up until the second half and how many balls were dropped by the WRs. He ran for 45yrds. This is a stupid decision!!!! Foles folds as a starter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KROPPTOP @stevenpo1989 Mitch will be back. Foles folds as a starter, he is a finisher.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So now Foles is the starting QB now. They just blamed Trubisky for the defense slacking in the first half of games and dropped balls and being 2-0. Such disrespect to Mitch.

<|startoftext|>@Joelhatcher77 @Yippie371 @BadSportsRefs I'm a die-hard football fan I've been watching football since I was 7 years old. I understand what a pile up looks like when trying to determine who has possession of the ball. This situation was different. He was on his back with no players over his face.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yippie371 @Joelhatcher77 @BadSportsRefs And I also would have stood with my own convictions. It's one thing for a player to be on you, this is football, but 2 referees over you? Nope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joelhatcher77 @BadSportsRefs Cool story but you don't know what he saw from his position with his helmet on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaskedEmbiid  https://t.co/pdxwrUP6OO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joelhatcher77 @BadSportsRefs The ref shouldn't have been over him anyway. I would have been like get the f*** off me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BadSportsRefs Yes this was a complete horrible call<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Telegraph it is not true and why don't you actually interview a PPE expert because we would tell you that these masks are not rated to protect against a virus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Telegraph Hmm, how interesting seeing how these masks are not rated to protect against a virus in either direction and this has been known for many years in healthcare. It could, however, cause further infections based on improper training and improper wearing of masks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarfuryFlames @MrHodl And it's highly disrespectful and harmful.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lacjr1977 Yes they charged one officer, the shooter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kudos to @RandPaul Fauci is a fraud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Patzfan5112 @knighthawk1966 @CaliSquid @TomPelissero @RapSheet @MikeGarafolo Amen. They are not rated to stop a virus from either direction. This is my field of expertise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndersenPickard @DaveyRohan @TomPelissero @RapSheet @MikeGarafolo It is optics. Imagine people who are not experts in PPE thinking they are right about these masks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@icepuck2 @wakacaraca @TomPelissero @RapSheet @MikeGarafolo Nor people around the wearer. They don't stop a virus. I have 18 yrs experience in health and safety controls, specifically respiratory protection.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Razzmattazz1976 @grabowsky_k @Ryderx90 @katherineefoley I don't think you understand who selects, tests and implements health and safety controls. It's not virologists. I also have a Public Health background. These masks have no NIOSH rating to stop a virus either way. Fact! You're confused who is credentialed on PPE limitations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IgnorantSpot @grabowsky_k @Ryderx90 @katherineefoley I'll link you to a podcast I am doing to talk about masks with another PPE expert. We film it today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grabowsky_k @Ryderx90 @katherineefoley Sr. IH here 18yrs. I train HCWs on PPE, cross contamination, pathogen prevention, sat on infectious disease boards, managed the RPP for over 76K ppl. These masks are not rated for a virus, unless N95/PAPR. You're not a court credentialed PPE expert. Sit down  #MasksOff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PlanetFitness I did. They said it was Corporate Policy that there are zero mask exemptions. Try being a veteran who survived a gang rape w/ her face covered w/ permanent damage, that she can't work out to help combat PTSD because she can't cover her face. I'm also a Sr Industrial Hygienist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PlanetFitness I had to suspend my membership today, I will eventually cancel. Why are you not following the law &amp; letting those of us with medical exemptions, to enter. There is no offered reasonable accommodation. Documented disability since 2010. Veteran here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayDizzyD @OLRiveraUSMC @BoJack39 There needs to be more accountability for bad calls. When we get replays on tv, and it's clear to us...they need to be reviewed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am a PPE expert, yes Belichick is wearing his mask upside down. It's fine because these masks are not even rated to stop a virus, either direction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidhey77 Well, I actually am a mask expert and yes, he is wearing it upside down lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RadeeohRich Yes<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@elemental Don't wear a mask without medical clearance and ensure the mask is NIOSH rated to protect against a virus and be clean shaven. These are N95s and PAPRs. Not cloth masks, not ear loop or surgical masks. Impromper masks are harmful to the wearer. (SME on masks here)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@squatchland @darth12e @DBAKevlar @RNordog @nypost As a subject matter expert on masks, NO. Once again, these masks Are not rated for this virus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@squatchland @darth12e @DBAKevlar @RNordog @nypost Incorrect. I'm credentialed to speak about masks and respirators in court. These masks are not rated to stop or prevent the spread of this virus. These masks worn improperly and the wrong type are leading to further spread.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@haikurendevous @AF_D00Mr @nypost Cloth masks don't protect the wearer or people by the user that donned the mask. It must be NIOSH rated so either an N95, 99 or PAPR.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PatrickTooSoon @RNordog @nypost I would like to see how not wanting to wear something that doesn't work against a virus is harmful to others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vinzsko1 @RNordog @nypost If delusional is having 4 degrees in this field and a court credentialed expert on masks... I'm super delusional haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RNordog @nypost It's called fighting for freedom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nypost I support this. As a PPE expert these masks do not stop Covid. I am a Sr. Industrial Hygienist. I've tested well over 10K masks. Take them off!

<|startoftext|>@Mlark4Smith @djf510 Yes they have. As an Industrial Hygienist, I have seen it in infectious disease wards where prolonged mask use occured and I switched the staff to PAPRs.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Kevinisinmaine @ptsd_grl @dad7x7 @jesscacaroline @Allegiant @united I'm not a Republican. I am a Voluntaryist and former Libertarian. The masks do not prevent the spread of a virus. I have 18yrs in the field as an SME on masks and Respirators. I have 4 degrees.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kevinisinmaine @ptsd_grl @dad7x7 @jesscacaroline @Allegiant @united I'm not a Republican, but I have the right to fly via the ACAA and I can't drive the 36 hours round trip in a vehicle because of a lower limb issue with my knee locking and maltracking when seated for a long time.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ptsd_grl @dad7x7 @jesscacaroline @Allegiant @united My PTSD is from being raped by two cops while on active duty, where I was forcefully sodomized and cut with resulting nerve damage and inability to cover my nose or mouth.

<|startoftext|>@dad7x7 @jesscacaroline @Allegiant I think if just one single airline made masks a choice, they'd get all the business. I have hundreds of thousands of @united miles, but they are descriminating against me as a disabled veteran with PTSD that cannot don a mask. Documented disability since the early 2000s. It hurts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Belgarion_Riva @imlaurenshelton @Wildheart_Baby @Siwgth @JimMFelton @mchooyah @Delta The science is the same. I have 18yrs in this field. You think PTSD is some one size fits all medical condition. Try being raped, mouth and nose covered, cut and permanent damage to your body. PTSD is from an array of diff traumas. Mocking it is ignorant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Belgarion_Riva @Wildheart_Baby The Law is for respirators, FFPDs and nuisance/dust masks and the science is the same. I don't care who works for you or what you do, if you're not an IH or an Occ Doc you're not credentialed in medical conditions that exempt mask and respirator use.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jgoneal Yes! This data is on point and what I've been studying for 18yrs. This is so refreshing to see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SportsJerk @WrongHIPAA @HorianaNee @Delta @united Another what? You're calling me a Karen because I am a subject matter on PPE and also am a disabled veteran with severe PTSD? Be kind, it's help humanity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SportsJerk @WrongHIPAA @HorianaNee @Delta @united It's the Michigan Supreme Court that went over the direct threat issue.   It's obvious you're not versed in ADA law. Nor the ACAA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Delta @kevin_dorff I have to fly soon, I want to make sure your med professionals realize PTSD is a medical exemption, if your PTSD is triggered from trauma when your face was covering or in combat in a mask. I have it documented as a disabled veteran.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Das2eas @Delta They allow medical exemptions. You speak to a medical professional on a phone at the airport. If the med professional is credentialed in PPE, PTSD is a well known medical exemption from respirators in the workplace, it applies to any facial covering.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imlaurenshelton @lee946 @mchooyah @Delta Lauren I am a Sr. Industrial Hygienist and spent 9 yrs on active duty. I have PTSD and cannot don a mask. I also have coordinated mask exemptions since 2002. PTSD is a major reason people become disqualified in the workplace. You're correct.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Belgarion_Riva @imlaurenshelton @Wildheart_Baby @Siwgth @JimMFelton @mchooyah @Delta Just look up OSHA 29. CFR 1910.134 app C. PTSD is a major reason I have had to exempt employees from wearing masks and respirators... For 18yrs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Khanjae4 @codeofvets @Darlajeanv @Delta Do you know how many different traumas cause PTSD. Many people who were assaulted and had their mouth gagged or covered or hoods over their head cannot cover their nose and mouths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SportsJerk @WrongHIPAA @HorianaNee @Delta @united Learn about ADA reasonable accommodations and what constitutes a direct threat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SportsJerk @WrongHIPAA @HorianaNee @Delta @united I am correct. I suggest you look up Constitutional Attorney Katherine Henry. She had gone over this many times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrongHIPAA @Tamtrum3 @realsled @Karaoketershi @James78141017 I can't don a mask. I have several medical issues that exempt me. I am very familiar with what medical issues allow exemptions. I'm a Sr. Industrial Hygienist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tamtrum3 @WrongHIPAA @realsled @Karaoketershi @James78141017 When did you ask? Show the tweet where you asked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrongHIPAA @realsled @Tamtrum3 @Karaoketershi @James78141017 Or you could look it up. Hold the presses, a troll account doesn't know how to research.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Graced767 @Jacksonhack77 Your account is fake and these hackers are scam artists and want prepayment via cash app. You're whole account pushes supports for these scammers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reedmom54 Yes, because masks can impact dead air space and increase heart rate by an average of 20%. There are so many aspects to risk associated with masks, it's why the Thoracic Society also is involved in OSHA's RPP laws.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TomValdosta @StormWatcher65 @RichDuszak @Delta There are many reasons for exemptions. I have an exemption and I have also coordinated exemptions for 18yrs in workplaces. I see the tests and reasons for exemptions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@philo187 @USATODAY Do you know how descriminatory that is. I have a mask exemption and you think so should be hauled like luggage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a valid medical exemption, I am just nervous the med professional doesn't understand what issues exempt the use of a mask.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone received the "clearance to fly" through @Delta ? I read it requires a phone consult w/ a med professional.

<|startoftext|>@old4dis @gmfb @KirkCousins8 Thank you. I have 18 years of experience here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mcumming13 I have so much respect for EMS and Fire. I've worked closely with FDs with emergency response with HazMat issues and testing your SCBA and suits for leaks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ksbw Wow, did you even think to consult an actual expert in masks, which is an Industrial Hygienist. The worst part about this article is the image in which the person has facial hair. ü§¶<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mcumming13 Wow, the best part of that article is the guy's facial hair. You're not supposed to don a mask with facial hair!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fuxachechunk @gmfb @KirkCousins8 A PAPR is what is rated as protection against this virus.  Cloth masks, ear loop masks and other non NIOSH rated facial coverings do nothing, other than help stop large debris/large phlegm from projecting. These become soiled and disturb proper gaseous exchanges.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am a huge fan of the show, this is meant to educate, not be political. Again, Industrial Hygienists train healthcare workers in masks, respirators and other PPE. Most IHs are against the masks, they require training, NIOSH ratings and health exams and are not for prolonged use.  https://t.co/Gjt3cqX6d8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gmfb re: @KirkCousins8 I keep hearing you all say, "the doctors say". Please understand doctors are not the experts on masks and PPE and pathogen prevention. It's Industrial Hygienists, which I am. Masks are not rated to protect against a virus and can cause harm to individuals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Francine_Locke @HarvardChanSPH @j_g_allen @GovWhitmer Anyone else from an IH or EHS field also cringing at how mishandled this whole issue had been. Seems the media only talks to doctors, ignoring the SMEs on identifying and controling health hazards. I'm shocked masks are being recommended for untrained personnel. Improper wear!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EricTopol @mccabe_caitlin If the Governors actually knew what they were doing, they would have had an Industrial Hygienist on their team this whole time.

<|startoftext|>#TrumpCancelsFootball  This is just stupid haha. You know who has increased the spread... States that mandate masks. I have yet to see @realDonaldTrump  mandate masks. Masks can increase the spread due to improper use and using masks not rated against a virus.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LarissaMVLopez @ABCFactCheck What you can do is continue to tell me that I'm incorrect but when you hold 4 degrees in this field, then you can speak out and argue with me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LarissaMVLopez @ABCFactCheck Cloth coverings and ear loop masks haven't even greater risk of health hazards because they are not rated to be worn the way that they are. There is no NIOSH ratings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LarissaMVLopez @ABCFactCheck You should also look up 29 CFR 1910.134 appendix C.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LarissaMVLopez @ABCFactCheck I didn't crop out anything I did a screenshot. I pretty much know everything there is to know about masks and respirators and SCBAs. The same science applies to cloth coverings, N95s, elastomeric masks, and FFDS, dust masks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LarissaMVLopez @ABCFactCheck  https://t.co/iAKbbRu5DO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LarissaMVLopez @ABCFactCheck Furthermore, these masks that people are wearing are not ready to protect against a virus and are completely pointless and do lower immune function and interfere with proper gaseous exchanges.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LarissaMVLopez @ABCFactCheck You're talking to someone who specializes in respiratory protection and masks. Prolonged masks use can call an array of problems. The number one reason people are exempt from wearing them in the workplace is from PTSD and claustrophobia. I coordinate exemptions.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@united I'm not sure why this account won't reply with who my attorney needs to speak with. Can you pass on to your higher ups this is a violation of the Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA), which applies to all US carriers operating anywhere in the world. Also the ADA.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Allegiant @united Thank you so very much! Ironically, aim traveling to speak about the health risks associated with masks and how they are not rated against a virus. 18yrs testing masks, 9 yrs of it while on active duty. ü•∞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Allegiant are you still honoring medical mask exemptions? @united  has chosen to violate disability rights which are well documented through VA records. I'm a high level member w/ United &amp; they are disrespecting disabled ppl. I'm also a Sr. Industrial Hygienist aka PPE expert.  https://t.co/l3RDZFpMPz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@united I'm hoping to be given information on who my attorney needs to contact. My disability rights are being violated here and I also have high status with United so this is so disturbing I can't even use my miles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@united So what you're saying is United airlines is going to discriminate against a disabled veteran with ADA protected rights against having to cover my face and mouth? I have a bunch of United airline miles and using United credit card.  Who should my attorney contact?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@united I don't need assistance for my disability, but my disability does not allow me to cover my nose and mouth, it's documented in my Veteran's disability records. I read mask exemptions are accepted, but with approval.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@united is there a specific number to call to get my medical exemption against donning a mask annotated and approved? I saw online people need to call before their flight. I don't even want to book until I know my disability is annotated. Thanks for any info.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now the left is offended by a hair style. No group or culture gets to trademark a hair style and bash anyone who wears it.  It's all about intent and I highly doubt @Adele was trying to mock African culture.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Unless you'd get a pap smear or colonoscopy from a plumber, please stop getting mask information from the media &amp; doctors! Mask safety, usage, limitations, ratings, medical requirements and hazards of use are tied to those of use who are Industrial Hygienists &amp; EHS Specialists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABCFactCheck I like how you're calling information from those of us that have tested well over 10,000 masks, senior industrial hygienists, that it's  disinformation. I have seen so many people faint and have panic attacks during just fit tests, not even wearing masks for more than 3 hrs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeWeatherfo11 @k_helca @kirstiealley @Lukewearechange @UN I had the ordering forms and chemical procurement! Nothing you tweet changes what the judges saw. Stay in your lane, when you approve chemicals for use in the AF... Get back to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joeynolfi When you get degrees in Industrial Hygeine, gain 18 yrs experience in the field, and test over 10K masks...  Then share your views on masks. Until then, I have the credentials above. Masks are not meant to be worn how they are being pushed and not rated against this virus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tracybeanz I saw the photos from @GigiBowman . We love you so much!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeWeatherfo11 @k_helca @kirstiealley @Lukewearechange @UN I find it quite interesting you think you know about every single aircraft because you were a flight engineer.

<|startoftext|>@PaulyG103 As a military veteran and a police accountability activist. I am sending my deepest thoughts your way.

<|startoftext|>I don't care who sleeps with who, as long as they're an adult and it's consensual. Why is this issue, I won't  even name, trending. I really feel like the left is trying hard to tie this to Trump. Smh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LilDarrelMathew @timk519 @scrowder Exactly!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JWOLFFH As an anti-liberal even I need to say that this is accurate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HotInEER Are you assuming I'm a liberal I feel like that's your issue, because I absolutely am not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HotInEER I guess my purple hearted army veteran spouse is also a disgrace to the uniform because we have the same ideology on the lack of constitutionality of police.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@parryetriposte @scrowder I believe anybody has the right to shoot someone if it's an immediate threat to their life in the form of self-defense. If you are the initiator of the violence, you are not granted self defense. Also seven shots....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@timk519 @scrowder I don't talk to police officers they are the pure antithesis of the constitution which I took an oath to.

<|startoftext|>@scrowder I am a fan of yours but I'm also a huge follower of holding police accountable to their oaths and I cannot see a situation where shooting someone in the back seven times is just. It is not the jobs of cops to act as judge, jury, and executioner.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JodiPyle2 @DebbieTrainor @GovWhitmer I'm a Scientist. I specialize in Respiratory Protection/Pathogen Prevention/PPE.

Drs are not SMEs here  https://t.co/It1DJp4d17<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Justsayn9 @DebbieTrainor @GovWhitmer Surgical suites have set air qaulity, humidity and temp to ensure proper gaseous exchanges.

<|startoftext|>@GovWhitmer Every single press conference you do, you improperly don and doff the mask. You put cross contamination on display.

<|startoftext|>@TravisAllen02 @RepThomasMassie Surgical masks are not rated to protect against this virus. I've tested well over 10K masks over the past 18yrs and am an SME on PPE and Respiratory Protection.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@emilykmil @JennaEllisEsq @RepThomasMassie Except if this was really about health and safety, these Govenors would actually have EHS Experts on their teams.

<|startoftext|>@ted1thomsongmai It's my own schedule that makes it hard. I have my hand in a million things trying to fight the tyranny here in Michigan. Blake is a good guy. I will try and do more. I was actually worn our yesterday, I'm normally was more hyper lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zixianna @borzou Literally all of this is incorrect! All of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yankeenviron Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@achrisvet @nanoc22_reynold @borzou And don't wear them more than once.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@achrisvet @nanoc22_reynold @borzou This meme... When a mask is soiler and worn more than once it's loses its integrity. Droplets and humidity inside the masks kick back carbon dioxide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Full interview can be found here.   https://t.co/3G1IZ8anIe  Why masks should not be mandated, the truth about this debate.   #MaskUpMichigan  https://t.co/npdnauis0W<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnbstrempler @borzou I'm not full of shit. In 18 yrs in this field only maybe 3 women were cleared to wear a respirator for emergency use. Not shift or daily use.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stephii100 @L_A_Baker @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump This video is not correct. That is not how to test oxygen for mask use. You have to test inside the masks. I've done over 10K of these tests to clear employees for mask use, many fail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@L_A_Baker @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump They do decrease oxygen. I'm sorry people are so hateful. I've tested people in makes for 18 yrs. It most certainly can decrease oxygen, that's why, in the workplace, employees have to be medically cleared to wear a mask or respirator.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cherlynhyde24 I'm not either. I'm a Voluntaryist. I use to be a Libertarian.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jrevkin This is not Representative of testing for inhaled oxygen. You need to test inside the mask, there are IDLH readings. Nurses and doctors don't test masks and respirators on people, my career field does and I've don't well over 10K tests.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nanoc22_reynold @borzou I'm doing two media interviews about this tomorrow. To dispell these false information from people who are not SMEs on masks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@s_gaudelli @borzou I don't suck at my own job but thank you for your compliments and kind thoughts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nanoc22_reynold @borzou Yes you can it only takes three to five minutes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ed_ruthazer @QueenBe74558749 @borzou the laws and science is based on direct readings at the source. This is why in healthcare settings, most pregnant women are excluded from wearing an n95. Breathing through N95 mask materials have been shown to impede gaseous exchange and impose an additional hazard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PureNRK @juliairzyk They have to show you are an immediate and direct threat, not assumed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PureNRK @juliairzyk You have to have a documented disability, which I do. 100% disabled veteran.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GigiBowman @CBS12 Amen! He isn't wrong and my profession agrees with you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QueenBe74558749 @borzou Next time read my tweets better. I have 4 degrees in preventive medicine and I know what I am talking about because I test masks on people and coordinate their approval or disapproval of wearing a mask or respirator.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QueenBe74558749 @borzou I know a pulse oximeter measures 02 levels! What I said was it is not what you use to test 02 levels inside a mask! When you get a fit test for a mask the measurement of oxygen is measured inside the mask.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlueIrishAngel The real meaning of the thin blue line is to cover up and protect your brothers and sisters at all costs, which means to also lie and stack evidence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhilHynes1 @LeonHendrix I'm not wrong, but you go ahead and think what you want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gramsci33 @borzou Adrenaline! Also, respiratory issues are not all triggered by the same thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlaskanGunNut @borzou I am being honest. Honest with 18 yrs of experience in my field of study.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RenoChazz Exactly. Karen's are normally racist or nosey women. A Karen is not a person who calls out harassment for a disability. I have a disability that exempts me from wearing a mask and I, luckily, have yet to have an issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gramsci33 @borzou If she has a respiratory issue, she shouldn't wear a mask.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LetsGoTigers21 Headed to bed and will absolutely explain in detail tomorrow, thanks for the question. .... But... #gocubsgo lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Helvis87 How am I a Karen? Please explain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She's not a Karen and she is not wrong. People with respiratory issues and conditions almost always are denied approval to be able to wear a mask or respirator, in the workplace. The science still applies to the general public. 18 yrs testing masks here!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikemajlak @eugenegu Well as an Occupational and Environmental Toxicologist we are the ones who tests people in masks and select which makes is used for what and when and people with respiratory issues are almost ALWAYS EXEMPT from wearing one based on 29CFR 1910.134 part D.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@L_A_Baker @JoeBiden Thanks @L_A_Baker as the type of Scientist who tests mask and understands their medical requirements, usage and limitations. They should never be mandated!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@borzou Applies to masks and respirators.  https://t.co/eGiUqAAtmW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do not listen to this! People w/ respiratory issues should not be the ones in masks. Standing &amp; using a pulse oximeter is not how you test. You have to perform certain movements and test the air inside the mask. Holy hell! I've done probably over 10K tests on masks/respirators.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@borzou People with breathing problems are the ones who should NOT be wearing a mask. Look up 29 CFR 1910.134 part D. This is my profession and you are spreading dangerous misinformation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@borzou All these people just standing there and using a pulse oximeter are doing IT WRONG!!!!! OXYGEN DOES DROP. I've probably tested over 10k masks on people. I've seen people pass out wearing them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@borzou This is totally invalid. To perform a test you have to perform certain exercises, bends and use an LEL type meter or qauntitative fit testing machine to test O2 levels. I know this because I do these tests!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@color_confused @LeonHendrix I also had a stroke in my 20s, which also exempt me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@color_confused @LeonHendrix I also happen to be in a profession that sets up and clears people for mask use in the workplace. There are many, many medical issues that exempt mask use, that has nothing to do with being "sensative". I also know the limitations of masks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@color_confused @LeonHendrix Sensitive? I was held down, mouth covered, cut, raped and abused while on active duty. I can't handle even being cuddled, barely handle a dentist appointment, and cannot cover my mouth! I have PTSD &amp; it's a protected disability and I could no longer wear a respirator or gas mask.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom Don't be selfish, stop making blanket mandates. Many people cannot and should not wear masks or face coverings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom Don't be a tyrant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juliairzyk It's obvious you just used this tweet to promote your book.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juliairzyk I'm not spreading misinformation. Illegal orders are being spread throughout this country. You're causing shame on people w/ disabilities even in this post. You think a business should turn me away, a 100% disabled vet, who can't cover her face. üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juliairzyk Most businesses are not accommodating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juliairzyk You're not correct! Look up the case with Karl the barber here in Michigan. The state had to show he was a direct and immediate threat. Also, see how the mask mandates are illegal. A business would have to show someone has covid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhilHynes1 @LeonHendrix I also cover Public Health issues in my field.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@color_confused @LeonHendrix I can't cover my face, medical reasoning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@color_confused @LeonHendrix Why would I need to stay home?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juliairzyk You are incorrect and you know it. The business has to show your disability and inability to wear a mask causes an immediate or direct threat to their business, not a presumed or assumed threat. I help employers accommodate ADA requests,.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeonHendrix I don't wear one and cannot wear one. I am tired of people offering me masks and pushing them on me. I cannot wear one because of a medical issue and also I am a SME on PPE and they are not going to stop the spread.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovWhitmer Nope and do we sue you when we have adverse health reactions and denial of service because we can't wear one? Are you even willing to sit down with me? I am an SME on PPE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steph_Solace @GovWhitmer And also end the drug wars and policing for profit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovWhitmer Detroit is a shit hole... and I live in MI.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom The science shows that homemade masks and ear loop masks do not protect against this virus. Also, mask use is not for everyone and should not exceed 4 hours. Maybe consult an SME on this issue... Oh yeah, that's me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom Are you going to provide a written health risk assessment to show why you ignored the heiarchy of safety and controls, went straight to what should be the last resort, PPE.

<|startoftext|>@DJSHIRE Incorrect. Whether or not privately owned, the previous cited safety issues are managed by the state. The state just turned their heads.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crunchylizzy @realannapaulina @KennethCityPD Exactly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realannapaulina @KennethCityPD Sadly I just followed you and now I am second guessing it. I am an AF veteran of 9 yrs. Nothing says,  violate an Oath, like our police. Their thin blue line is so corrupt. Support  https://t.co/xViSIP2DX2 not just "the blue". Police need to remember unlawful orders are tyranny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeAnna4Congress @HillaryClinton And no respect for veterans. I absolutely do not appreciate Clinton calling me a Domestic Terrorist, when I served 9 yrs on active duty and have an Oath to uphold.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HillaryClinton You got it wrong and many of us are veterans upholding our Oaths, not violating them. Also, the Capitol was not stormed! Storming doesn't involved leaving your signs outside and getting your temperature taken and walking in.  https://t.co/wjvCA7Bopk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A person who uses unlawful violence &amp; intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.@GovWhitmer is utilizing Unconstitutional rule to control/ intimidate MI Citizens in the  persuit of VP. ‚òùÔ∏èWebster's definition of a terrorist.

<|startoftext|>@KailLowry @rileybabe143 I agree. A parent not showing up doesn't mean love is absent. This rhetoric leads to parental alienation if the absent parent tries to be more involved, later.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoeySalads It boasts fear and ends up with control. Just like an abusive and toxic relationship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meijer There are several employees who are being told by HR they have to take unpaid leave. Their medical issue that would exempt them from having to wear a mask should have been found in the medical evals that are required. You must show how it presents and undue hardship to not pay em<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meijer To show why the heiarchy of safety and controls concluded only PPE will work. Feel free to DM me and someone can call me I have 18yr experience as a Sr Industrial Hygienist and Safety Specialist aka Occupational and Environmental Toxicology.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meijer No PPE can be mandated in the workplace that does not meet NIOSH standards. It must have a protection factor to reduce the hazards and a risk assessment must be completed to show.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meijer Sure. CFR 1910.134 and 1910.132. if you are claiming there is a respiratory hazard you must have PPE that is NIOSH Approved. That respiratory protection requires a medical eval, training and an initial fit test. Ear loop and homemade masks are not in accordance with this law.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovWhitmer You left out Virologists and Industrial Hygienists. Industrial Hygienists should have been Key!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovWhitmer I take note you did not include OSHA or Public Health Specialists. I know Epidemiology is a specialty within Public health, but you failed at utilizing a multidisciplinary approach.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrnakulbhai @HuffPostPol @GovWhitmer Why not? What is the issue. They were detailed security for the Rally Speakers. The cops have guns.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TechSavyTim @donaldt70077802 @HuffPostPol @GovWhitmer I am not talking about Trump.  I never voted for him and I am not a Republican. She is breaking the law and that is why she is being sued but the state legislature.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TechSavyTim @donaldt70077802 @HuffPostPol @GovWhitmer She is by definition a tyrant and a domestic terrorist. I don't write the definitions. I am a military veteran and highly educated. I am absolutely not a Republican. I am a Voluntaryist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TechSavyTim @HuffPostPol @GovWhitmer If they were wearing bullet proof vests it's because they want attention. There are armed people at the Capitol everyday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TechSavyTim @HuffPostPol @GovWhitmer I am a veteran of 9 yrs on active duty. I spoke at the capital as a scientist, the Michigan Liberty Militia was our detailed security. None of them are racist. They protected 2 black men on stage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OdinSkoll @Bananer_Man @jforjustin I'm not embarassed. Vaccines do not get the gold standard of safety testing like you are assuming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tannannepugmom @HuffPostPol @GovWhitmer Saying we are racists and had swastikas, she wants ppl to think it's  a pro Trumprl rally when half the people aren't even Republican.  Here is the swastika lol  https://t.co/iApT3tRZPg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 She is so hateful, it's mind-blowing  https://t.co/Y4Hcr5WEui<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HuffPostPol @GovWhitmer needs to be recalled. She is so full of lies/hate it is unbelievable. As a veteran, I have never felt this much tyranny. No one intimidated anybody. The Militia &amp; police have a good relationship. They are made aware of all the Rallys/Protests, which are very peaceful.  https://t.co/CEpxJAmsvB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OdinSkoll @Bananer_Man @jforjustin Actually in court, Toxicologists are SMEs on health hazards. The definition of Toxicology is below. For 18 yrs I study what impacts human health/the environment. MDs do not study toxicants nor toxins in vaccines. #themoreyouknowüåà  https://t.co/X8miF6tUIR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeithBroome02 @rock_city_girl @MIRSnews So do I, for the same reason she does... Which is why I understand why someone putting their hands on you, violently can trigger a response and panic attack which she had and left by ambulance and had to have scans and x-rays because of how they pulled her right arm and shoulder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeithBroome02 @rock_city_girl @MIRSnews If you are attacked and fight back that is self defense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bananer_Man @OdinSkoll @jforjustin I am a veteran of 9 yes on active duty. Calling me a retard is uncalled for. I am highly versed in vaccine hazards because I am an Occupational and Environmental Toxicologist. You don't have to be mean because we disagree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meijer How can I reach corporate? You are in direct violation of OSHA Law and your employees are contacting me because you are not following OSHA Law and citing the CDC. Where are your Industrial Hygeinists and why are they not internally informing you of this violation. I am a Sr IH.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rolandsmartin your coverage of the Rally in Lansing was very hateful. We are not white terrorists. I am a Veteran &amp; Scientist and spoke at the rally. You calling me a white thug is beyond wrong and misguided. Additionally, I didn't vote for Trump, but you labeled us all that way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LesvillanyiLes What is necessary for you. She has PTSD from previous sexual and domestic assault. This is called fight or flight mode.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LesvillanyiLes Self defense is a real thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeithBroome02 @rock_city_girl @MIRSnews She did... Watch her whole fb live. The MSP knew who she was and that's why she asked for them because she was being harassed and then boom... Assaulted and that's why an MSP stopped them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bananer_Man @jforjustin Maybe know what it takes to become a Toxicologist. I did dual enrollment in HS and graduated HS with most of my Gen Ed's done. I didn't attend medical school.

<|startoftext|>@justmellonie76 Do you hear yourself, complaining about not being able to do this or that.... That was the whole point of the protest. Many cancer patients are told their treatment is suspended and people cannot travel freely, which is a Constitutional Right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justmellonie76 You don't own the city. We are all Michigan residents and no one violated your rights but the Govenor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nefcon4 @DevsBee The woman who was assaulted is a doctor and she had media credentials and a day pass and the red coats assaulted her.  Brian saw him next day and was yelling at him for this.  https://t.co/5UVwdZKQ2O<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justmellonie76 He wasn't yelling at the Michigan State Police. Who should be locked up is Whitmer, for violating our Constitutional Rights.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Paul_Q @stonecold2050 And he wasn't screaming at the cop, he is yelling in between them at the man who assaulted a doctor the day prior.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Paul_Q @stonecold2050 There was a red coat (capital Sargeant at Arms) standing by the door. The doors were suppose to be open. Brian recognized the red coat as the man who assaulted this female doctor the day prior, who ended up in ambulance, that day.  https://t.co/2hZldTtY3T<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nefcon4 I am a veteran, I know what I stand for and why I protest.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Nefcon4 @AveryDausson He is not a triggered ass. If you watch the video everyone was shouting for the red coats to open the doors so the legislature could hear us say to vote No, which they did vote no.

Can you not Google? A quick Google will show you you're wrong and irresponsible. Taking note of your name to send to OSHA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CraigHunter85 @MichaelArther @AnnieMapp_ @abc3340 @willainsworthAL In my state masks are required for all workplaces right now. I know what I'm talking about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CraigHunter85 @MichaelArther @AnnieMapp_ @abc3340 @willainsworthAL Ha! Destroy me in court. How many court cases have you been summoned to to testify as an SME on OSHA Law. My husband is an EHS Engineer and wants to know who your employer because you need retraining. One of my Master's in Occ Safety and Health. FYI, IHs write the regs lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CraigHunter85 @MichaelArther @AnnieMapp_ @abc3340 @willainsworthAL I have almost 10 more yrs in this than you. What you are referring to is a nuisance mask than only requires initial and annual training. Maybe resign or go back to school.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CraigHunter85 @MichaelArther @AnnieMapp_ @abc3340 @willainsworthAL It is not a loose fitting mask it is a respirator<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CraigHunter85 @MichaelArther @AnnieMapp_ @abc3340 @willainsworthAL OSHA even came out and waived annual fit testing for N95s, but an employee still needs the initial fit test.  https://t.co/XmtNyT7FKY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CraigHunter85 @MichaelArther @AnnieMapp_ @abc3340 @willainsworthAL Yes it does!  https://t.co/tEAgwP5NCN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CraigHunter85 @MichaelArther @AnnieMapp_ @abc3340 @willainsworthAL How long have you been in your field? Yes you do absolutely did test for N95, old school way was saccharin, then banana oil and now  the qauntitative fit test attachment where you pierce the front of the mask to connect it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CraigHunter85 @MichaelArther @AnnieMapp_ @abc3340 @willainsworthAL I been a Sr IH for 18 yrs and I have fit tested people in N95s countless times. Anyone being mandated to wear one must follow 1910.134 and 132.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CraigHunter85 @MichaelArther @AnnieMapp_ @abc3340 @willainsworthAL N95 requires a fit test, med eval and training.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SayHeading @sheLLbeLL_xo I am screaming from the rooftops trying to find out where in the hell all the EHS and IHs are. I am a Sr IH.... I am livid over these violations and the messages I am getting where employees are being fired or suspended because they know they can't wear a mask due to med issues<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickyri73854795 @NIOSH @amazon @FoxNews @OANN This is what I sent to OSHA  https://t.co/H04taDuRwM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickyri73854795 @NIOSH @amazon @FoxNews @OANN Omg thank you. I've been looking for anyone else in my field speaking out about this. I am a Sr IH. You should see what people are messaging me. They are being admonished/ suspended for having med reactions to these so nothing masks. Where in the heck are all the other EHS folks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlockA_126 @PublixHelps Except they MUST be NIOSH approved and the minimum mask for NIOSH approval is an N95 after that is a half face respirator like a 3m 6000S or a PAPR. So many employees are out of compliance m providing an ear loop or cloth mask is not compliant with OSHA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SafetymanDavis @safetyabby @roguebug Correct is must be NIOSH approved. 1910.134 is not the only standard here. 1910.132 is the PPE standard.   I'm here for any further questions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@roguebug No this is not a respirator. A respirator is NIOSH approved and is tight fitting to wear air does not escape in or out through all 4 sides.  This is my field of study if you have more questions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Halfasstroknot Thank you. I've been working hard to fight this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EvelynNiessner @Nguyen_T_Cuong @PiperK @JudgeJeanine Don't tell a veteran they disregarded their countrymen, when the whole reason I went was for my countrymen, to stand up against unconstitutional orders.

<|startoftext|>@batman497 @KCBergsma @arlenparsa @marcorubio @SenRubioPress So all our employers are now who funded us?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@arlenparsa @marcorubio @SenRubioPress You're painting a group of an estimated 100K with this.

<|startoftext|>Anyone who wants an N95 mask and can procure one, has the right to. The mindset only healthcare workers should have them is like saying only cops can have bullet proof vests when there is an active shooter around. This mindset reminds me of death panels and rationed care.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tracybeanz I went to London in early October. 10 days after a lady coughed on me in a crosswalk, I was so ill.

<|startoftext|>@AMOwensby @RepThomasMassie But they do provide protection, just different protection factors. They should be prioritized for emergency responders/healthcare personnel, but many people already have them on hand, and need to understand their limitations and usage, but they are WAY better than a nuisance mask<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AMOwensby @AriellePruitt7 @RepThomasMassie There is major contradicting info. 6 ft apart is fine, but it can stay around for 3 to 4 hours. Which is it? Cross contamination isn't selective. They need to clarify the risk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AMOwensby @RepThomasMassie Massie is correct. If someone has N95s already on hand, to tell them it won't work for them is incorrect. It is the best thing they have. Media should just be honest &amp; explain who needs it more and that it is required by 29 CFR 1910.134  I am the person who manages this program!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AMOwensby @RepThomasMassie Hi, Occ &amp; Env Toxicologist here. Managed IH program for hospitals for over 15 yrs. Yes, N95 masks require fit tests/clean shaven w/trng. However, to say they won't provide any protection is wrong. People can google how to wear them. Fit tests are only required in the workplace...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@westcoastdefens A whole bunch of people who make over 100K are not salary. They are hourly or commissioned based. My spouse is salary and will get 70% pay of his workplace closes. That's almost 2k less a month. Also, depending on location, that plays a big part.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/5xFmCOXXJg  #flushot #vaccine #COVID19 #CoronaVirusUpdate #Quarantine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think about it... someone who makes over 100K tends to have higher mortgages and auto payments. If they lost income over this covid/tanking economy issue they deserve more of their stolen income back. Giving more to those who lost less, is beyond disgusting.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>A one time explanation of where she needs to report in the event a drill or emergency occurs, if by chance she is in the bathroom at the time of the drill. She's 15! Not a bad teen.

<|startoftext|>What is the distraction here? She has a previous class in a diff bldg and has 7 mins to get to class. So she isn't late, she reports to class. The teacher already knows she has to go. The bigger distraction is shaming my daughter in front of the entire class....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In 2020, my 15 yr old gets threatened w/ detention because she needs to urinate. Apparently, her need to use a toilet everyday causes a distraction &amp; she should drink less H2O.

<|startoftext|>@IndustrySkeptic @suckitloser69 @Mel_Batoste @MarAnnSum @cbc021089 @freepsports @MarvinJonesJr It's not the best. Saying that clearly shows you're unaware of what the FDA keeps quiet.

<|startoftext|>@suckitloser69 @brennal0307 @IndustrySkeptic @cbc021089 @freepsports @MarvinJonesJr And you are more likely to catch it from the vaccine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mel_Batoste @MarAnnSum @IndustrySkeptic @suckitloser69 @cbc021089 @freepsports @MarvinJonesJr Or that they contain neurotoxins and carcinogens and animal dna?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IndustrySkeptic @brennal0307 @suckitloser69 @cbc021089 @freepsports @MarvinJonesJr Nothing is one size fits all. I personally would not choose to use that type of toxin.

<|startoftext|>@bassregenerator @Jessesgang @wsavalexb They don't need the same motive. Federal employees take an oath. They violate the constitutional rights and also sexually assault travelers. They put their hands inside pants and grope breasts and buttocks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Liberaltarian3 @wsavalexb The TSA has yet to catch a terrorist. When you sacrifice liberty for security, you deserve neither. As both a sexual assault survivor and a military veteran, they are unconstitutional and their "pat downs" are sexual assault if done in the streets.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AidanJa59325758 @10News I think my 15 plus yrs in my field has equipped me with the knowledge to know not having a vaccine doesn't cause an illness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@memelargestboy @10News Basic hygiene, plumbing and universal precautions caused the decline before a vaccine was introduced. I won't argue with you because this is basic public health information and it's long been proven.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kwuser21 @10News Non tainted cannabis that is vaped helps so many people. When you can provide a safety and efficacy study on ALL vaccine toxins and toxicants, and their synergistic toxicity vs one size fits all benefits.... wait... you cant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IntuitiveVegan @10News Right!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkyC12000 @10News It is a health issue. The amount of people with adverse events tied to vaccines insanely outweighs the health issues with vaping. I don't vaccinate because I've been studying them for well over a decade in my field.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realiwasframed @abytw @DoGoodBeGoodNow @DeesKnits_ @FromBenC @SenatorGalgiani @HollyJMitchell The facts you think aluminum, formaldehyde, and polysorbate 80 have no toxicity when injected, you should stay in your lane, as you don't undunderstand basic toxicology.

<|startoftext|>@Kabehr1401 you don't get it, you're reaching far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CherylTague yes, and when I hear Hillary speak my stomach turns, what she has done to Bill's victims is horrible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hillary trying to have an opinion on Trump's locker room banter when her husband is a man whore and rapist. Ha! #debate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kaa_wren @ThomJeff7 @PrisonPlanet deny rape culture? I was raped by two men in 2002. I have PTSD &amp; scars. Didn't make me a feminist though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RicksRant @ghostbusters224 gasp, I'm offended. Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kaa_wren @Zujabes I haven't heard Trump's accuser, just a Jane Doe. If his is proven, I'd blast him too.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Az99tm @PrisonPlanet women talk worse shit, I guarantee it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zujabes I know Bill isn't running, but his wife who enables &amp; defends him is, which means I dare her to say something about Trumps audio<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThomJeff7 @PrisonPlanet I am aware of the Trump rape claim, when they come out as a non Jane Doe I will listen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FilmBUFF82 right! Haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marybleuz205 and I am not even a Trump follower, I just have to call out the media bias and Hillary is a corrupt thundercunt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KissFromAjrose @Jakersmom1982 I don't care if people cheat, whatever is consensual isn't my business.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThomJeff7 @PrisonPlanet waiting on woman to come forward not as a jane doe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wikileaks/Guccifer dump emails showing Hillary lied under oath, armed oppostion &amp; defrauded people through her foundation. Then #TrumpTapes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marybleuz205 @PrisonPlanet I fully agree, hell... I could be a writer for cards against humanity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@burrovago what he said and does, I survived being raped by two men, I don't  are what sexual wording Trump uses, Hillary defends rapists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bill Clinton rapes &amp; dems aren't appalled. Trump says "fuck" and "pussy" like many people, including me &amp; media shits themselves #TrumpTapes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RogerJStoneJr Do you think the Trump campaign will address these wiki and Guccifer dumps?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SensiblySecular weather modification is something we have been doing for decades, it is just not supposed to be used in warfare.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SensiblySecular conspiracy shit. You're talking to a military whistle-blower on the topic ma'am.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@redredrattler huh? I'm not understanding<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@redredrattler attempting to have civil discussion here. I am asking what good ones. Ppl can be good, but not the profession.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alpha6Phinsider @shaynalamour1 Alpha, she blocked me. Ha! Statist gonna state, haters gonna hate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaynalamour1 I did, I said formerly Chicago, now Michigan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redredrattler what good ones? You have to take emotion out of what I'm saying. Cops exist to generate revenue, that's not respectable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaynalamour1 @Rolandito2500 @Alpha6Phinsider he died.... he died, he's dead, was s murdered. Had no weapon. Again, his life didn't matter?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaynalamour1 @Rolandito2500 @Alpha6Phinsider i think it's a domestic terror issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaynalamour1 @Alpha6Phinsider you lost me at "if a cop tells you". Cops are henchmen, I don't communicate w/ them. I am not their prisoner<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaynalamour1 @Alpha6Phinsider they wear vests, they had a better chance than he did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaynalamour1 @Alpha6Phinsider if that was your child you'd be outraged.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaynalamour1 formerly Chicago now Michigan, lived all over, 9 yrs in military. I've been assaulted &amp; in danger. Govt doesn't protect me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaynalamour1 @Alpha6Phinsider being scared isn't grounds for shooting someone is you have a concealed carry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaynalamour1  where do you live I don't walk in peace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaynalamour1 @Alpha6Phinsider everything you say is irrelevant because it was his vehicle and the cops should have left him alone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaynalamour1 @Alpha6Phinsider if I shot someone because they reached and I was scared I'd be in jail I don't have the same protection<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaynalamour1 @Alpha6Phinsider poor argument. Unless it's pointed at you don't be trigger-happy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaynalamour1 @Alpha6Phinsider cops need to learn about inference vs observation. I don't talk to cops, reaching isn't verified.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Anti gun crowds want to restrict guns, but call men w/guns. Push restrictive gun laws, yet have armed guards. Derp<|endoftext|>
