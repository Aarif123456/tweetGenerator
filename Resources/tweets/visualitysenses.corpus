<|startoftext|>@MukulVDhiman @MadisonKittay @AOC Snakes are cool And generally quite anti-social (my dad used to keep snakes). Supporting the social good is anti-snake.

<|startoftext|>@DapsDraws Illustrators and other creatives need better protections under the law. In short: we need lobbyists who keep politicians and the public aware of our value. I agree with your assessment of the headline. It isn't called for just because you demand what is yours to begin with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jabberworks get in touch with them just the same. Sometimes they will be culant and help you just the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zeitonline Die Wahl ist erst entschieden wenn die Volksstimmen und dadurch die Wahlmännerstimmen ausgezählt sind. Was Trump macht is illegal: ein Versuch die Macht unrechtmäßig an sich zu reißen, wie der kleine Diktator.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a genuine problem for #illustrators. They create content that gets used and not credited. In Germany, the credit is regulated by law, but in other places it isn't. Being credited heightens visibility and success in a low-paying field. Please sign and support illustrators.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jenniemaizels At university, they have groups of 10 Students working together and the group has to go into the studio 1x/week for using the equipment. The only thing the students + teachers can do is to practice good hygiene, wear masks and try not to come close to each other.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jenniemaizels Unfortunately, there is no "perfect" solution. My son is in higher ed, occupational training. Some stuff cannot be taught online as it the students need the physical practice to qualify for the finals. My daughter's at university, where they are taken to online education. …<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZiggyMurphy69 @Aerocles In my hometown it meant that the principal, who lived on the highest hill in town, couldn't safely get to school. Then it became a snow day. We had a lot of lake effect snow and were pretty hardened up. It had to be a lot of snow for a snow day. Means super snowmen and forts, etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Aerocles @AskNezka I loved snow days, hot cocoa, making snow men and stomping through the woods on snow days. It is like hitting the lottery numbers when you didn't expect it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@typeoff @stewf schools teach, so we teach our kids what we believe. Belief is never a good factual foundation for education.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@typeoff @stewf Recently in a Reuters' article it said that Voters without a college education tend to lean towards trump. I see this as a sign that many have lost the ability of critical thinking and questioning their own beliefs. I heard a docu where a church lady said, we don't agree with…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jenniemaizels they split the classes and used alternate days. Kids are bringing blankets to schools and wearing winter coats in class bc the windows have to be opened often. I'd prefer to see my son home, too, but know getting him to study without structure is difficult.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jenniemaizels Jennie, I'm not sure where you are, in Germany, where I am, politicians are quoting "the right to education" to try to keep schools open and kids educated, trying to reach kids from lower income families. I have mixed feelings and wonder how this is to be managed. Last time...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChrisOatley it is a good thing I did look today as i was flattening some digital search and find art for my book cover. I found an unpainted hole in a man's chest. Yupp. You could see through him. That would have been plenty embarrassing. Funny that my publisher didn't see it either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Handsome_Frank @ohmgee you just need an interesting business card carrier.  https://t.co/5jDUAsT2n5 has a nice fan out one. I printed mine with different illustrations on each and let my contacts choose. So it is a clean go. One that only holds up to 15 cards is generally a good choice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Handsome_Frank one of the recipients bought the printing rights and the original the day she received it. Go for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Handsome_Frank Actually, with all the packages being ordered and delivered, inkl. food and useless items, the question provokes interest. Paper does not seem to be a corona carrier. So go ahead and send cards and business cards. I created beautiful greeting cards on 300 g paper and…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christiemegill Just normalise it that Mom is a creator and needs me time. Just like mom needs kid time. They grow + every stage is wonderful. Now my daughter is a writer. Makes me proud of her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christiemegill There is a saying in German: Little children, little problems; big children, big problems. But honestly, because my kids have seen me create and have also critiqued my work (my son once drew onto an image when I was using the loo) they've grown a sense of creative judgement.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@christiemegill but your child will learn to accept that. Start with short intervals, give them a distraction coloring book or something to explore or a kitchen timer ⏲ and write during that time. It isn’t perfect but it works in the ling run.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christiemegill At least you’re toddler sleeps. My daughter, now 22 &amp; a writer, would only sleep 😴 for a max of 3 hrs a stretch even nights.

<|startoftext|>@drawingsara A good meat substitute is eggplant, mushrooms or a kidney and black bean mix. You can use canned beans, that makes cooking faster. The trick is to chopping the food into a course texture. You can steam the eggplant if you don't like the way it absorbs oil …<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mgoldst It happened to me as a student once &amp; had a group dynamic. I stormed out of the class. My prof apologized to me later bc he didn’t have the class under control at that moment (his words). That stabilized my future work &amp; taught me about fair critiques ½<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_TomMcLaughlin Actually, it wasn't the tv we were worried about. Our house was on a clay based hill with very old trees, some dead.

<|startoftext|>@BenIllustrator @Handsome_Frank I do this bilingually, depending on the day and who I last spoke to. It ranges anywhere from "skribbles" to "layouts" to "Grobentwurf" or "roughdrafts" or just plain "draft" or " Entwurf.

<|startoftext|>@superneuronurse It is. And really, it isn't a cheap solution, either. Patterned wallpaper is expensive and we have that downstairs. But upstairs? Its Rauhfasertapete and paint. You have to pay for paper, glue (cheap) paint.  https://t.co/xbH7kzsxTg<|endoftext|>

I've also discovered creating a personal ltd. edition greeting card and hand writing the text ups your…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theChrisDo is the exception. I think that is gained when you actually get a commercial client, like BMW, VW, Siemens (big company, big bucks) or a pharmacy company who needs a kids book.  I've been looking for those companies. I've gotten requests…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theChrisDo and are only renumerated at &lt;7000€ with falling prices. I could self-publish, but need a sales rep to get the books into the stores. The volume is key. Sales must be &gt;4000 books per print run. The Illustrators Organisation quotes earned fees from 1500-8000€ per book. 8000€…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theChrisDo Actually, few. The average German  illustrator earns &lt;12,000€ a year before taxes. That number is so bad that the gov't allowed the Artists Social Insurance drop their yearly min. income from 5000€-3000. My work-intensive search&amp;find books take 4-6 months to make…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@superneuronurse They have a standard boring wall paper that is a little nubby. Someone said they use it to hide imperfections ins the walls, but I don't like it - our house is plastered with the stuff upstairs. It is called Rauhfasertapete - rough fiber wallpaper.  I'll send you some. its fugly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theChrisDo I would have to stop illustrating children's books and children's educational books completely. So, yes, I need a different client. But my heart is with encouraging kids to read and imagine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@superneuronurse Why were they shocked? Because they have never done it any other way. They don't paint directly on plaster. IDK why. They just don't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christiemegill When I was a kid and new headlights for cars came onto the market, we were told in school how terrible they were. They were too bright - they said. After a while, everyone had them. The same went for seat belts. And you see, more people survived because of them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yay! Space Dads are home! @NASA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jenniemaizels You can do this. Maybe find the compromise that she calls you when she gets there, or if there is a delay. That is common courtesy, just like you'd tell her when you are going to the store - or out. That will ease your mind and give her more freedom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drawingsara we all have to keep shouting out that message. Money and making a living are not a dirty word in other occupations. Why should it be in ours?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jenniemaizels Well, I think you'll have to trust her. I flew across the ocean when I had just turned 17. They were distant relatives that my family hadn't ever met before. Yes, it could‘ve gone wrong. I faced your decision last year with my son. Letting go is hard, but necessary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drawingsara school. You never get noticed until you have that one romance. and then all the boys want to date you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drawingsara You will find that moment where you say to yourself… I am doing well. And then you'll have that "boyfriend" moment… when the client you have been vying for calls, but you have to console them, because you are booked out for the rest of the year. Kind of like dating in high<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drawingsara there are mediocre artists that get paid well, because they are good at business. I want my students to be exceptional artists that don't have to scrape to make payments. You can do this. Be a Business Artist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drawingsara so listen closely: I think you can make it. But you have to promise to take some simple business courses while you are at uni. Bookkeeping, negotiations. And if they don't offer that then look for books about that. Art is business. And …<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drawingsara It is essential. Unfortunately, when you do, you go against a wave of teachers + institutions that just focus on creativity. That makes it difficult. So when my students have their last day with me, I tell them: "I really only tell this to students I think have potential…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drawingsara I cannot bear to have others buzzing around, so this long distance internship works for me. But you must know whom to trust<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drawingsara but it is harder to pay for help when you cannot pay your own bills. Get a short term intern to help you with stuff. That works. For me it is my "home office" intern, a former student of mine who lives in another country. My workspace in my home is so small.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drawingsara However, if I didn't keep plodding on, I wouldn't have been able to make the books I've made. The advice: It takes 5-10 years to be able to earn an income from illustration seems to be true. It takes longer if you are a caretaker for your family, generally this is the mom role.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drawingsara It didn't help to try to get 60-70€/hr for children's books. It is the worst paid branch in the business. That was the recommendation of the German illustrators organisation. I lost so many opportunities bc of that advice in the beginning of freelancing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drawingsara One was: It isn't wrong to know how to make money. So while I teach future designers+illustrators I tell them to learn negotiating &amp; bookkeeping. Basic business stuff.

<|startoftext|>@MartinaFlor I've been on both sides of learning + teaching languages. The most effective form of correction is to mimic "mom-speak".

<|startoftext|>@superneuronurse Probably. I would have to research that, but it could be that they are related to catnip in some form or contain some kind of substance similar to the catnip scent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theChrisDo Germany, where I am based, as essentially outlawed them. The only thing you can safely (in a legal sense) send is a greeting card that you've signed yourself. And yes, that is stated somewhere within the law, b.c. it isn't a "mass mailing".<|endoftext|>

Women seem better at it. Also women seem to disinfect their carts more often then men do. ##corona<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@superneuronurse I had a bout of that the other day. And now I am trying to catch up with my work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am sad that it had to be cancelled, but the silver lining is my illustration is on the virtual illustrators wall, I get to take part in the #dustormagic masterclass and I can browse the #UniverseofStories at the #BCBF20 @BoChildrensBook #pandorasbox #coronavirus 📚❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For all my children's books colleagues around the 🌍M Missiroli + R Jančiuaskaitė made a pop-up calendar for the Bologna Chidren's Book Fair. Download it and start making it here  https://t.co/Vax5FFHmFv #BCBF2020 #bolognachildrensbookfair #freedownload<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@superneuronurse The first thing he says is "who is that" and the second is "whatever"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree. I am 🖌working on a series of illustrations. The author needed 30 minutes to write the plot. I need so much more time to illustrate them. And I am not using a complicated style.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheNoisyPencil  https://t.co/t26hwOaKdn This is actually a teaching #map for learning Italian for A1-A2. Portfolio piece drawing from my #LANGUAGE  teaching and learning experience. The link leads to the project page description  https://t.co/qGC1Q2UEzf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheNoisyPencil 100%vBut to be fair: I had gotten the illu-work before #corona broke out. Since it is project work, a search and find book and a kamishibai-theater series, I'd already started working on it prior to lock-down and will be busy until August.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I am really excite because the author Aloscha Blau is holding a painting seminar in my town at the  @Bundesakademie #wolfenbüttel #illustrationartists #illustration #gouache<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On today's #worldbookday2020 I ordered a #book from my local #bookstore. Even if they do deliver I will pick it up myself. No need to have it sent. I'm lucky we have two bookstores in our small town. #supportbookstores #read 🎨📕👨‍🎨👩‍🎨🖌  https://t.co/he1nBFf6MI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheNoisyPencil I work both in digital and analog mediums. This one, a private work, is a watercolor and gouache to fight the #isolation of #corona and help the #mentalhealth of others. We Turn our World Together.   https://t.co/GqRuGvqo69  https://t.co/m55qLwL5G2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samisketchbook @TheNoisyPencil you have lovely illustrations on your website.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheNoisyPencil I will probably replace the image, then. Do your requests for editorial go more along the way of analog or digital?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheNoisyPencil Sure I put in one but it was more of the Wimmelbuch/search and find style. I have another style - painterly. May I put that in as well because it is different from the digital style and I have been using it more.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@oceanblogging Epson doesn't have a perfect update for my scanner but compensates with Silverfast software for free. I might only just update to Mojave which has a stable build. You might want to try downgrading to that on a virtual machine, too. It won't fix all woes, but some.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oceanblogging I asked in a XING group and was told that I should test it on a virtual machine before I do a complete install. I will need to order an external hard drive to do the testing on. I'd also - burnt by one update - checked to see if any of my vip things like scanner would be usable.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SOB_Records @newrepublic I think it is just giving the semblance to the public that someone is trying to do something. Even such efforts can ease fear, even if they have no results. I agree that 45 is a huuuuge problem more toxic than the virus itself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VProofreader Habits are hard to break. But now the supermarkets have waiting lines to get in with entry control and you cannot go in without a cart. Shopping in Germany is a social event. We have farmers' markets 2x weekly. Even if you nod from afar, it's human contact for lonely 💙❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SOB_Records @newrepublic I'd once heard an interview of former presidents, albeit without former vice-presidents, they offer advice to the current president on difficult situations. It isn't that unusual.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VProofreader Here in Germany habits are ingrained: Saturdays and Wednesdays are favored shopping days, from 10am–1pm. Going on other days before 9 am or after 7pm gets you in and out fast. Sundays are usually closed by law, but I think that's been temporarily changed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@loishh it hasn''t much. My work situation hasn't changed. I've always been #workingfromhome The only difference is I can't call my clients who used to be in the office. Oh, and I can't film my #kreativtour #urbansketching videos<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>While I am happy to be living in Germany, I worry so much about my friends and former neighbors in Queens, NY.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To my fellow #Americans + US Residents in transit. The #USEmbassy Berlin recommends that you apply for the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program for health+security updates  https://t.co/uB6f3eOpm5 They don't expect airlines to offer direct flights from Munich after this week #Corona<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@superneuronurse I am so happy you got some. I looked on the shelves in the stores, but we don't have anything like lysol in aerosol form. The kitchen spray I'd mentioned is similar, but has -chloride instead of saccherine after the main agent.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If you are in upstate NY + can spare a can of Lysol so that she doesn't drag contagions from the hospital to her home, please message me. You will be helping to #FlattenTheCurve #StopHoarding<|endoftext|>

You can also donate masks to your local grocery store workers. I won't judge you. #DoTheRightThing #CoronaCrisis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Due to #corona hoarding + #coronapricegouging, my sister–a neuronurse–cannot buy #Lysol. Her unit will be taking on #coronapatients. She needs to sterilize her shoes. If you know someone or have a supply of Lysol please donate it to your local health workers…<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@susanarnoutsmit What this means for #corona is that you have to step away from set, use your common sense and not make yourself crazy with it. Keep your wits and humor about you, because when there is no cure, laughter is the best medicine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@susanarnoutsmit Remember when the shuttle carrying the teacher in it exploded? I learned to turn off the tv news. That didn't change the situation, but soothed my anxieties. My science teacher had applied for the program, but didn't make it. It could have been him.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mummyblogger I think we all try to pendel to the other extreme. My parents weren't huggers and didn't stand up to the teachers. So I did those things.

I'll check her out. Thanks.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OteghaUwagba I agree. Mornings, even as a non-morning person, are easy. Afternoons between 3- 4pm are difficult. In another life I would be a cat and take cat-naps. Oh, I forgot, I do that already #WorkFromHome<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bellarariora I could read the comedy plays of Shakespeare and never get bored, but I love new stories, too. It depends on how well they are written and what they are written about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vivschwarz If you don't want neighbors telling you to keep your lawn tidy, don't come to Germany. My neighbor's mom (RIP) came into my garden to tell me that I had to trim the bushes. I'd say live in a small cabin in the woods. No neighbors but for furry ones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@superneuronurse I am happy to hear that she is ok. How many house cats do you have presently - as opposed to the ones visiting in your garden?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@superneuronurse The first person to say "rabbit rabbit" on the first of the month has a month full of luck + good fortune. Actually it is to tease a friend who writes it. Since I'm 6 hours ahead, I can (when I remember) say it before she does. But I usually forget.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@r1k1n I know. It is hard and disappointing. You get into the flow, build up a great stock of resources and then, when it should pay off, it is over with. I am sorry to hear that they let you go.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@superneuronurse it's because you're human and a very responsible one. It isn't your fault, it was a specific situation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just love her work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@superneuronurse You haven't got it easy, have you? I could sing you the lullaby I used to sing to J + R. (They'll sing it at my funeral someday and laugh+cry at the same time).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theChrisDo @mrbenburns_ Could be interesting, kind of like the "Game of Life". Not going to school may have made him think more + gain practical skills not taught.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mgoldst I teach illustration + design online for an English prep college (high school equivalent). Primarily I use the school's platform, but I also share on Skype. I accept larger files by WeTransfer from students.  And what's yours?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@superneuronurse I'm glad you got home safely, too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@omgidrawedit Sources: LinkedIn, XING, Instagram etc. Google agencies. But: Try to figure what that person needs. Cold calls/emails go unanswered. Praise them for work they've produced. Be a fan.  Get to know the person. #patienceisavirtue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theChrisDo @timmWongg I tell students they don't need the degree unless they want to teach. But if they want to study, yes, they should. Benefits: creative exchange. I recommend apprenticeships. Creative exchange + earning while learning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theChrisDo @timmWongg I remember signing that student loan. High interest. No one explained to me what that would mean. My 1st loan. It meant working 3 jobs (2 PT+trying to freelance). It meant not having enough $$ at month's end. My degree opens doors, so 50/50 worth it. …<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theChrisDo With determination, a little demonstration of talent (it doesn't even have to be A++ talent) + a healthy sense of self. Oh, and you have to be willing to show up and learn. Take criticism as a critique on how to become better. You don't need to pay Harvard tuition to be an artist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@superneuronurse But we were awful dog owners, too. We put our dogs on a run, they had access to food and water and shade. Occasionally we played with them, but we never took them for walks. But we did love them dearly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thekjohnston they look a little like the weebles wobble but they don't fall down figures<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexmuench I am guilty of this. Perhaps it (something being obvious) relates to the way I see color. I see it. I forget occasionally that those nuances I see aren't obvious to others. Perhaps we take our own knowledge for granted.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@superneuronurse yes, she would  have. She always laughed when we described our ailments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexmuench Thanks, but you know, the glass can be half empty or half full. Had I stayed on, I probably wouldn't be illustrating right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OteghaUwagba I'm sorry to hear of the troubles. You need to tell them that the next person they will be talking to is your lawyer. That usually takes care of things. Also transaction fees are to be paid by the client. (Although you must make that known in your contract)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>2/2 swings gently–that is your emotional safety, but sometimes that clangs like a tower bell while you're standing next to it. That is just life. I appreciate my happiness more because I know what deep sadness is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I believe that without contrasts you cannot appreciate the moment. What is light without dark? Wouldn't it be monotonous to always be on the same level of emotion? That would be strange to feel the same when your baby is born and your mother dies. Sometimes the pendulum…1/2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@theChrisDo I realized what I find so special about this particular lesson: it speaks to the typical "feminine" role of "helping". Women are often raised to be aware of others' needs. I'd hug and help all the world if I could. Saying "no" feels contrary to that upbringing. But …<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theChrisDo I found it!  https://t.co/4FsGfjcdmi It took a bit of searching. Thanks. I found it quite valuable dealing with anchors and still coming off leaving a positive impression with the client.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theChrisDo because Illustrators notoriously work under value. In Germany the average illustrator earns about 2000€/annum. Only 2% make more than 50,000€/yr. That needs to change, one illustrator at a time. Thanks for your help.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@haydnsym I have been lucky for the most part, but I did have a client declare bankruptcy and never saw any money. I also write thank you mails to clients if they pay in less than a week, just for appreciation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I, too, have been debating whether to just delete #Facebook from my life. But that goes with the feeling of not being able to casually see what family members are up to… difficult when you live across the ocean. The other aspect is the business page I have. No easy choices<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theChrisDo I agree for the most part. Simple example: Adobe has user tutorials that are simple + let you go to your next level. They also have an Edu-portal where teachers share lesson plans and learn Adobe. The teacher tuts are death to creativity. 😴😴💤🦗🦗<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BenjaminHoff @WWecker @miplotex @museumsbund @LindenauMuseum @BurgPosterstein @KlassikStiftung @Friedenstein Es ist schwierig.

<|startoftext|>British MPs just voted that #animals cannot feel emotions or pain. Can you say that your pet doesn't suffer when it's sick or when it misses you? Or if its pet friend dies? #Wild_animals aren't different.  Massive outcry from the public can overturn this outrage. #cat #dog #pets  https://t.co/pakLeaEz7i<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobSnowCreative I cannot say that #psd or #ID give me a high, though if I had to choose, I'd say psd (sounds like lsd anyway). #AI often gives me a headache. A severe one, for which @astutegraphics is often the cure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdobeCreate Thanks. I'll try that with my next illustration. Up til now I've moved things around in Tabs, which can be a little inconvenient.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdobeCreate i didn''t know you could do that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AleneArt I know! I think it is only the line of the cheek and then you are done<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AleneArt I don't think you need to redo it. You might want to either soften the back eye or the line next to it. They seem to be fighting for attention. Otherwise well done! (And the car isn't wonky)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@flumeapp For something that is so popular, Insta sets very narrow limits for its users<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flumeapp the rules of business imply that using 3rd party apps can be a reason to have account cancelled. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flumeapp Have iMac up and running:  https://t.co/1vrA9TfV6F So If there is a page for app developers, then apps must be allowed. (Logic) But (cont)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flumeapp I found it yesterday within the site… accessed via account, scrolled down to FAQs + landed there. Need to turn on Mac to find exact link, ok<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flumeapp And that seems to be the Catch 22, doesn't it. I still think your App is the best, esp. for #illustrators analog or digital<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flumeapp I found a developer page  on Insta that contained a developer-forum. Didn't dig deeper.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flumeapp But I did find a developer forum on Insta. So why does Insta purge app supported accounts? #fuzzylogic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flumeapp It's difficult to get any official answers from Insta. Building an audience takes time, pls understand my concern about possible loss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flumeapp @Natalie_Brown Is it allowed because it is non-automated? I would rather use it than my hacks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Natalie_Brown then you can upload your pic. You cannot edit it like on the phone (and like on Flume) Insta is responding to Corporations' marketing wishes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Natalie_Brown You need the one for "responsive design". You will see an array of devices, click + choose one (iPhone) til you see the photo upload symbol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Natalie_Brown Most browsers have developers' tools. Chrome has recently been rearranged, so I use Safari. You open Insta and then the tools. 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flumeapp @Natalie_Brown I hope so. I do really like what Flume can do and it beats my going cross-eyed over my phone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FastCoEntertain Many have tried to get him banned, but, sadly were not heard by Twitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Natalie_Brown If you have Gimp or PSD you can fix your pics, export as jpg and upload.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Natalie_Brown @Flume, I really do love your app and bought it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Natalie_Brown Although I love Flume, you can lose your Insta-Account because it isn't an approved app. Upload using the developer tools in your browser<|endoftext|>
