<|startoftext|>Pitiful how I treat the mask. I touch it a hundred times a second, use it over &amp; over, &amp; put it down on the restaurant table when I'm eating. Plus I can't breath in it.

<|startoftext|>#TraderJoes doesn't fire the most atrocious of workers to avoid lawsuits &amp; negative publicity. It's all about the squeaky clean image. Sacrifice female customers to the predator workers to preserve their image.  #Oceanside #PREDATORHuntingGrounds<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's imperative that you start seeing the difference between superficial charm and genuine charm.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And that "fantasy" blows up &amp; turns into a nightmare after a couple rounds of fake &amp; exaggerated sex.

<|startoftext|>Life shouldn't be recovering from or overcoming tragedies. Humans are so screwed up. I say humans should stop breeding and leave the world to the animals. The #predator tries to breed w/ every woman he meets. He should be imprisoned.  #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Love bombing is NOT love. It's selfish, low-level ego.

<|startoftext|>But then again, the #TraderJoesOceanside #Predator will make glib &amp; superficial sounding apologies when he's love-bombing someone &amp; trying to get sex or getting sex from someone. But his fake apologies are never backed up by real &amp; improved action.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sure the Predator used #coronavirus to get sex &amp; attention. How much you wanna bet me that he sexed-up his masks &amp; made a whole sex-display of mask designs &amp; colors?

<|startoftext|>How on earth is the #TraderJoesOceanside #Predator keeping his penis to himself during #COVID ? He can't spend 1-second alone; he needs constant attention &amp; fawning.

<|startoftext|>I wonder how the creepy "love &amp; light" spiritual whack-job workers at #TraderJoesOceanside is handling #CoronavirusLockdown.

<|startoftext|>I wonder if the #coronavirus  slowed down the #Predator from sticking his penis out to most anyone - trying to have sex with most anyone, and throwing food at most anyone to ingratiate them. Nah, doubt it. He probably just hyped up his ONLINE-PREDATORY life.#TraderJoesOceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our intuition kicks in before our brain: We start realizing that we're with a dirty, creepy, pervert, predator. Our libido shuts down as a protective mechanism.   #TraderJoesOceanside #TraderJoesSanDiego #TraderJoesNorthCounty<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The Predators idea of being "spiritual" is to groom &amp; love-bomb most anyone, enable toxic evil, pit his most recent love-bombed target against horrible people &amp; to lie around eating, showing his d*ck &amp; trying to get sex. #TraderJoesOceanside #TraderJoesSanDiego #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator says graduated from #sdsu: then, no, 3.5 yrs - had to dropout to save mom's restaurants.

<|startoftext|>@clubtraderjoes Just watch for all the sugars and carbs and The Trader Joe's Predator.  @TraderJoesPrey  #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator is an empty vessel, not filled with soul, nor guided by spirit. He love-bombs bad grubbing &amp; grabbing people &amp; women to feel "okay" about himself; to be "approved" of. I unconsciously saw his emptiness &amp; tried to fill his void; it's impossible; he's an empty monster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I found The Predator's notes of the women he was grooming for sex. I threatened to come forth.

<|startoftext|>The Predator gets away with it because he ingratiates, grooms &amp; people-pleases crew, mates, captains: lied on his app; works the shifts/days not wanted; works closing &amp; off the clock to make mates/captains look good; plays "poor boy, just looken' for a girlfriend, angry ex" card.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So true. We're told that there are all these "assistance programs" out there but when we call them, they all respond, "can't help." It's a Gaslighting: Thousands of "assistance programs" that do nothing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The Predator doesn't have his own light or energy.

<|startoftext|>The Predator has absolutely no standards, morals, values, or even his *Own Light* or strength: He morphs into whoever is standing in front of him.

<|startoftext|>@wifeofthenarc I know it's so hard out there. Cut expenses, go minimal, do without extras.

<|startoftext|>#TheTraderJoesPredator is crazy &amp; comes from a family of crazies.

<|startoftext|>The Predator is never satiated. He has absolutely no self-control or self-discipline or loyalty when it comes to feeding, flattering, fawning &amp; f*cking almost anyone that moves past him.   #TraderJoesOceanside #TraderJoes #NorthCountySanDiego #MeToo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator is obsessed with his own penis &amp; acts innocent about it: "oh, I never measured it, really? oh, only sending you d*ck pix because I'm not sure you'll like it. oh, I have all sorts of heinous sex diseases because of the ex wife or toilet seat."  #TraderJoesOceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stonecold2050 Hideous. And just so creepy. Yes, her eyes are disappearing into slants. Sad that women are brainwashed by men to think they have to do this to please the creepy &amp; gross man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator immediately crashed in on my home &amp; stayed for days. I was a dumb sex-target &amp; gullible caretaker. I overheard him telling another supply/sex-source that he was sorry for not getting back to her, he was depressed, in a dark-place. Aw, poor boy.  #TraderJoesOceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I said to The Predator that he shouldn't use #TraderJoesOceanside as a "pickup bar," especially after getting fired from #LaCostaGlen for sexual harassment, he said, "Well, other guys find their dates &amp; wives here." Our Sociopathic Hook-Up Culture fostering Predatory Thinking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator says the words that everyone wants to hear. He's the most perfect social-chameleon. Once he love-bomb traps you, the mask comes off: There's nothing there. It was nothing but words, love-bombing, grooming, seduction, manipulation.  #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seduction is a #RedFlag: It's a quick, short-term, flashy show. It isn't real, pure, authentic, long-lasting or meaningful. It's a manipulation. The Predator seduces everyone: this is how he gets away with being a covert Sexual Predator.  #TraderJoes #Oceanside #NorthCounty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator went from one lust moment to the next. He arrogantly impregnated as many of these lust moments as possible. He brought innocent lives into being just becuz he's empty &amp; thought "planting seeds" was manly. Now he's happy because these Objects distract him from boredom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Way better looking, and oh, way more interesting, then the selfies The Predator takes with all his sex targets and monkeys.  #TraderJoes  #Oceanside #VistaWay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Narcissist actually makes you sick, mentally, emotionally, physically: just trying to keep up with satiating them, keeping track of who they have their eye on &amp; fawning after, who's on their phone now, what flying monkey are they turning you against..

<|startoftext|>People who are kind toward the animals are usually kinder toward humans, more conscientious &amp; moral, make a better friend and why? It's empathy. Empathy doesn't just stop at animals. Empaths are the people who take care of the world &amp; everything in it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator takes incessant selfies of himself &amp; every single supply that's ever showed up for a free meal. His phone looks like a hunter's home with dead faces &amp; body-parts hanging on all the walls.

<|startoftext|>@AlisonB12244537 Thanks. It's so scarily true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madmarchheather It's very different from someone proclaiming the right religious belief: there is no way to prove there is a God &amp; what kind of God. But there is NO MISTAKING that animals feel, want to live, bond w/ their babies/mates, fight for their life, suffer, scream &amp; cry before slaughter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator recycles people as often as he changes underwear. We're all interchangeable people-parts to him.

<|startoftext|>Add in the Spiritual, Hippy, I'm a Buddhist, Old-Surfer Dude who just wants to eat out, coffee-out, groom everyone for partying &amp; sex &amp; good-times &amp; all while claiming "brotherly love, love for all, it's all good, no judgement, positive thinking, let's get naked &amp; do tantra..."<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ConwayShow Conway Jr repeats a dangerous message: "Have kids, more kids, kids are the greatest thing ever, your life will never be better..." Most people are terrible parents, are miserable, if given the choice, wouldn't do it again &amp; suffer great financial stress because of it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnandkenshow Not cool. They put on a spoke-hole from the Meat Industry to bash the Impossible &amp; Beyond Burger &amp; then chimed in with the spoke-hole about how terrible, awful &amp; unhealthy beet juice is. Hey you idiots, beet juice is extremely healthy!  #vegan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I called The Predator out on a lie or yet another creepy thing I caught him doing, he ran away and immediately looked for an ex or new sex-target to have sex with, or a toxic flying monkey to party with. He's an old guy. What on Earth? #TraderJoes  #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Karolin04276290 Great. It's your time to shine, to be an educator, to talk like a teacher. Methodically and systematically explain what this creep does. Be nice, if supply is being nice to you, and inform. I try to be friends with old and new supply. Women need to stick together.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet, the #FlyingMonkeys sell their soul &amp; mental health just to keep the #lovebombing , support, free food, handyman service &amp; inappropriate favors &amp; gestures coming their way; to be toxically co-dependent. I made a choice to be free, healthy, independent &amp; to grow on my own.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone who's ever come in close contact w/ The Predator's grooming &amp; love-bombing is a mentally-wasted basket-case. All his exes &amp; children are mentally ill. He even laughed at an ex who committed suicide ("she was crazy") &amp; another who died because of the stress he caused her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wifeofthenarc To manipulate and to control the proceedings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet The #TraderJoesPredator thrives. How? Why? He love-bombs, seduces, grooms, manipulates, fawns over &amp; controls down-n-out, lowly people who aren't doing their own independent work &amp; who are sell-outs just to keep his partying, good-time love-bombing coming in.  #MeToo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This same #FlyingMonkey Ex ran away from their marriage, left him with baby, who's old now, but becuz he does inappropriate favors for &amp; supports her, she acts brain-dead enough to turn her back on the lives of other innocent women just so she can benefit from the #lovebombing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>but he love-bombs, fawns after, keeps all exes in his back-pocket for supply &amp; some for possible sex; so Flying Monkey Ex dismissed it all away: #LaCostaGlen ? "Well, just a bunch of bad women." The Predator Lists? "Just a guy thing." Women not protecting women.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>to shop, have spent $100,000s since shopping @TraderJoes as a kid - his love-bombed &amp; ingratiated #mate, #captain, #crew Flying Monkeys gave me dirty looks, awkward, but I kept my head raised &amp; smiled ... I then decided to reach out to one of many Flying Monkey exes for help ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>tried to get The Predator into #therapy; instead he disappeared to roam the streets at night looking for sex; I threatened to go to #TraderJoes, he instead ran into the store &amp; made-up a story that I was angry w/ one of his #crew Flying Monkeys &amp; every-time I returned ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>didn't know it then, I was on the list, &amp; lucky me, was included in accidental texts between #mates &amp; #crew about progress made &amp; w/ whom; later, even luckier me, I later found the notes, journals, logs of the Predatory Games; I started connecting all the horrifying dots ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>then he soon forms a "Who Can Get Laid First" Club @TraderJoes with #mate &amp; #crew, starts ingratiating, connecting with, love-bombing customer &amp; coworkers, was up to 25 at one time, couldn't keep track of it all so kept a log of who &amp; what love-bombing trick tried ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>to screw women in a group he joined, then he pulls in his children to get them to feel sorry for him - re #LaCostaGlen &amp; yet another divorce from yet another one of their mothers, &amp; starts partying w/ them &amp; crying to them that he's lonely &amp; they shouldn't go off to be adults ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>he sent the d*ck pics, then when that didn't work, last resort, he claimed umpteenth toxic wife was cheating on him &amp; that he was lonely. The 1st thing he does after this horrible life-lesson was lie &amp; charm his way into #TraderJoes, get on #Facebook &amp; post pix of him trying ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator brought down #LaCostaGlen w/ multi-million $ sexual-harassment lawsuits, faked being mentally ill &amp; delusional to try to save his umpteenth toxic marriage &amp; "relationship,"  makes up a story that the women accusers threatened to kill his children unless.. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True. New Supply can be the most evil of all the flying monkeys. Not all though. He brainwashed me that his 'flying monkey exes' were "great friends" &amp; I ended up being nice to them all; while they were the awful ones..just using him, triangulating us, to keep getting freebies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Karolin04276290 @EvelynSaves Good point @Karolin04276290 . We probably "stole" him from the supply before us thinking we were better, more special, loving, tolerant &amp; deserving. We probably weren't very nice to his exes that he made out to be "horrible" and "crazy."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator is a master of not reacting, turning into a poor, little, victim boy and even faking depressive delusions when he gets caught. He pulls his flying monkeys into his sad depression (children, exes, enablers) &amp; gets them to feel sorry for him &amp; defend him. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator just ignores all charges against him or softly, quietly turns into a "poor victim." He reacts to nothing &amp; at times even appears dumb &amp; out of it. He fakes going into depressive, delusional states to get out of trouble. In the meantime, we're all in reaction mode. üòï<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clubtraderjoes @TraderJoesPrey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wounded54159549 I inform the new supply, in a nice way, that he's a predator. I do this because silence is enabling the predator &amp; it's keeping humanity stuck in evil. Mostly: I wish someone had warned me. If I believed or not, that's not the issue, it's planting the seed that counts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're never going to evolve as humans if we condemn a woman who speaks out against predators in our society &amp; side with the man because he glibly remarks, "she's crazy," or "angry ex" &amp; simply because he stays calm, people-pleases &amp; has a penis. #MeToo   #TraderJoesOceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ResilientNis Exactly! But it took us awhile to figure that all out. They played mind-games on us &amp; at one time, they made us believe that they were highly desirable &amp; we were lucky to have them. ü§Æü§¢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@moudbas I'm here to talk if, when up to it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I first met The Predator, I couldn't believe all his many exes 'let him go.' "What's wrong with them," I thought!? Now I see how lucky they were to get away long before I did.   #TraderJoes  #Oceanside  #NorthSanDiegoCounty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #TraderJoesOceanside Predator has gotten away with his destruction for years because he love-bombs &amp; continues to support his angry exes &amp; old children. His flying monkeys stay quiet because they're being supported &amp; enabled. They don't care about the human carnage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BPsychologies We can heal only if we take our power back. Not having boundaries, or the ability to say "no", and wanting to be "loved" is what led us into the toxic relationship to begin with. I believe there is no other way to heal but in gaining strength, power, courage &amp; independence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ThingsThatShouldntExist Sexual Predators who target lonely, financially struggling, desperate to be loved, paid attention to &amp; taken care of, spiritually dead-eye &amp; brain zombie ladies walking through grocery stores looking to fill-up their dying souls.  #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelynSaves Thank you. It's all an illusion: everything they say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews You are "liking" the fact that most people are going further &amp; further into debt? That many of these "shoppers" will be wrought with stress &amp; depression in February when they have to pay the price for this nonsense? Not cool ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@omg_a_llama You did great with the email. Their "no response" is a sign of their problem, not yours. Can you go above the person you sent the email to?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator is The Grand Gesture King. He wins over your family &amp; friends &amp; all his mates &amp; crew by doing inappropriate &amp; excessive favors. Add in 'The Innocent Little Boy, Bad Women, Unlucky in Love' Act &amp; we have the most dangerous serial sexual predator around.  #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kiktacos @lhsaapso1 this is only a 30 sec video. so hard to tell the truth of what happened before or even after. maybe he hugged her already? maybe he hugged her a few times already? hopefully.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator is a compulsive sex addict. He seeks comfort through seducing a woman to have sex with him &amp; then ultimately driving her to compliment his penis. He's so compulsive that women fake orgasm just to satiate &amp; calm his anxiety. #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VirgOGoddess915 @ResilientNis Often times, the one before stopped appreciating and valuing you because you weren't appreciating and valuing them. So, the cycle will repeat: No matter what new honeymoon-period happiness you go through with someone new; it'll soon turn bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clubtraderjoes @TraderJoesPrey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When The Predator stonewalls, he's out looking for sex, distractions, party-time with exes, children, anyone. He love-bombs back in exes, new supply, anyone who moves past him. He's a professional ingratiater, fawner, charmer, seducer, love-bomber.  #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They don't come from good families, despite what they say. Their family enables them, gets them out of trouble, aid-abets them, are just as narcissistic &amp; predatory; often their father drove their mother crazy &amp; no one understood what was happening because father was "cool dad."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator has to appear like a hero in the lives of people who'll allow him to take charge and to be in control. He finds down-and-out people to control and to be their hero, their savior.  #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Main Triangulation Tactic of The Predator. He keeps his exes in his "back-pocket" for ego-supply and re-love-bombed them back whenever I called him out on something. He refers to them as "friends" &amp; when I called him out on this "friendship" lie, he triangulated me even more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator has to make everyone "like" him. He'll do what ever it takes, throwing anyone under the bus, including his children, even new sex-supply, to make just about anyone happy. He's the most weak, insecure, people-pleasing, injured, empty soul you'll ever meet. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I threatened The Predator: I was going to #TraderJoes w/ the Predator Lists; was trying to force him into therapy. Instead, "poor little boy" quickly ran into the store, grabbed captain, mate, &amp; crew &amp; invented a conflict between me, the angry ex &amp; one of his mate flying monkeys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clubtraderjoes @TraderJoesPrey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every-time I broke up with The Predator, he immediately love-bombed &amp; seduced old supply or found new supply. When we got back together, he discarded them. I asked him if these women still come into #TraderJoes to shop. He coldly said, "Not anymore." 7 that I know of. #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was on the predator list of 25. He explained it by saying that I was "the chosen one," that "he chose me." I said, "No, I was the only one who was down-n-out enough to tolerate you for so long; the other women realized who you were &amp; dropped you. I was the last one standing."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He goes after 8-25 women at a time; has to keep it written; Columns: Name. Trait (e.g., big nose; short; redhead). Job. Interest (e.g., yoga; surfing; wine; karaoke). Seduction (e.g., gave her a book; flying yoga class). Result (e.g., went well, she's into me; returning to ex...)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnneTownsend007 I uncovered decades of "stalking notes" &amp; lawsuits filed against him-sexual harassment. He's gotten away w/ destroying lives for decades becuz he supports bad people who cover for him. He's driven his kids insane, literally, &amp; two exes to suicide. I'm the 1 who's taking a stand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CousamaO3 @ResilientNis Cowards. Weak. They put their thoughts out there but don't necessarily want to stand by them - or defend them - or deal with a counter-statement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnneTownsend007 Good question. I want to think that I'm not: he's a horrible person: fraud, liar, sex &amp; porn addict, destroys everything he touches - human &amp; animal life, cons, tricks his way through life; I don't miss him &amp; the chaos at all &amp; am super happy being free &amp; independent...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#IGotWokeWhen I found The Predator's journals, stickie-notes, sharpie on cardboard torn from veg &amp; fruit boxes systematic notes of customers/co-workers he was cultivating, grooming &amp; seducing for sex. Main tool used: excessive attention.  #BressiRanch #Eric #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#OnMySexualToDoList Stay away from male grocery store workers who are walking around with sharpie &amp; piece of a cardboard box wanting my name &amp; phone-# who blows up a relationship every year but it's always someone else's fault &amp; he's a great, innocent man. #TraderJoes  #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theiceman6752 Very good question. I've often wondered about this myself. I'm not on dating sites &amp; don't do selfies or any type of image presentations, but all the women I know: heavy makeup, hair pieces &amp; extensions, special filters/lighting, photoshopping. I've always been curious about this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everything The #Predator says and does is to keep up appearances. He's a shallow cesspool of love-bombing, seduction tricks, wearing a mask of a great, loving, good man &amp; friend, innocent &amp; naive, "angry ex, just looking for a girlfriend." He even lies about his age.  #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@omg_a_llama Perfect. Yay. Taking the power position and doing it in a great and controlled way. Let me know what happens. Feel proud of yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ThingsImCanceling Allowing myself to be love-bombed, ingratiated, groomed, and cultivated for sex by narcissists, sociopaths, &amp; #Predator s who work at grocery stores. And allowing the groomed Flying Monkeys to deter me from speaking the truth.  #TraderJoesOceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@omg_a_llama You did the right thing. Now go back in there, nice and business-like, and request that you get back on the schedule. Keep your request nice, short and to the point. This will be a huge step in taking back your power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@omg_a_llama Walk in there like a business-woman, taking care of good business, no emotions, speak eloquently, and ask her to her face what's going on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perfectly describes The Predator. Great, short read. They are not plotting and planning, or as many say, doing all this on purpose.

<|startoftext|>#BuyNothingDay Minimalism.

<|startoftext|>@omg_a_llama I love any tweet that uses the "creepy" word. That word so perfectly describes these idiots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator puts every ounce of energy he has into love-bombing &amp; people-pleasing a new sex-target or monkey. As soon as he's got the person positioned, he returns to grooming, love-bombing, enabling, supporting, sexualizing &amp; partying with his old children. #TraderJoesOceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@veestash Great point. Never thought of it that way before.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TeamTrump @ngghbgfcbn Lie. Unemployment has *not* reached a "record low." More low-pay jobs without benefits, without respect, without pride &amp; honor were created &amp; more people are working 2-3 part-time, dehumanizing jobs to try to keep up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so Thankful to be done with the Cognitive Insanity attack on my brain.

<|startoftext|>I'm Thankful to be done with The Predator. Long be gone the days of throwing 6 course meals, that he somehow conned me into preparing, into the lazy, gluttonous, using, abusing mouths of his Narcissistic Supply Flying Monkeys just so he looks like the Feeding SuperHero.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm Thankful *Facebook and Instagram* are down. They remind me too much of Creepy Selfie Postings and The Predator is King of Creepy Selfies with any slightly moving Narcissistic Supply that crosses his path.  #TraderJoes  #Oceanside  https://t.co/2uhdLTzVUk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Sick Toxic Creepy Holiday Season with The Predator: He uses any holiday to love-bomb his nasty trail of Narcissistic Supply - exes, children, anyone who moves &amp; is creepy - with gluttonous food offers.

<|startoftext|>Gross Creepy Lowly Thanksgiving Past with The Predator: He conned me into using my kitchen &amp; my slave labor for hrs to prepare a 6 course meal for his toxic monkey tribe.

<|startoftext|>Plays the victim of bad women. Plays sexually naive &amp; inexperienced.   Lies about the greatness &amp; accomplishments of his flying monkeys &amp; children/exes turned into monkeys. Lies about his past, goals, troubles, financial irresponsibility, &amp; sex &amp; porn addiction.  #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator trained his children, exes, co-workers ... to be his flying monkeys. He supports them, parties with them, gets them out of trouble, excuses away their bad behaviors &amp; they fight for &amp; attack anyone who stands up against his evil.   #TraderJoes #Oceanside #SanDiego<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2019carolyn haha, not The Predator. He's amazing, great, a hero, loved by everyone üòÄ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Old men are the most covert Predators; no longer taking care of or appreciating younger women; no longer evolving into focused, controlled old men. Old Predators are on Tinder, Match &amp; Viagra. And younger women in need of housing &amp; financial support are abundant. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Monkeys: The Predator targets dead-eye, dead-brain, dead-voice, dead-valued spiritual whack-jobs who show up for party, sex &amp; attention time &amp; close their dead, blind eyes to his destruction. Nothing matters as long as they're benefiting off of free grub &amp; handyman services.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator can make a connection to anyone. He appears as the best guy ever, hero, fun-loving, your best friend ever: He's into yoga, surfing, dancing, singing, karaoke, restaurants, bars. He's a composer who's never composed. He's a sad boy - victim of bad women.  #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator gets fired from #LaCostaGlen for sexual harassment, lies &amp; flatters his way into #TraderJoes &amp; the 1st thing he does is form a club, mate &amp; crew, to see who could "score" w/ the most customers/co-workers. Guess who was accidentally included in the group messaging?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #Predator surrounds himself with monkeys who he manipulates, fawns over, bestows inappropriate gifts &amp; gestures upon, enables &amp; gets them out of trouble.

<|startoftext|>Shame on you #LaCostaGlen! Women there filed sexual harassment against The #Predator &amp; won but it was kept quiet so their public image &amp; profits wouldn't suffer.

<|startoftext|>I found the stalking journals: Names, defining characteristics, seduction tricks tried, results &amp; follow-up plans. I threatened to go to #TraderJoes.

<|startoftext|>The Predator took down #LaCostaGlen with multi-million $ lawsuits: sexually harassing women. His side: the women were angry &amp; bitter.

<|startoftext|>#TipTuesday Spiritual &amp; Religious Sexual Predators are a very real issue: They prey on weak people who are into the woo-woo nonsense, non-thinking, non-doing, non-confronting mindset who lack boundaries, control, focus &amp; tough-love restrictions. #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eternal_love_13 Whatever gives you a thrill &amp; if that includes acting creepy, immature &amp; lowly, fine; but at least be upfront about it: Hey, I'm a lowly creep, who does lowly things in life for a cheap thrill because I have nothing better going on so I'll be going  out with you &amp; 2 others tonite<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator is the only one thriving. Everyone in or around The Predator's life is crazy, PTSD, drained, chaotic, confused, mentally-ill, poverty-stricken, depleted, a mess. It's a matter of what comes first, The Predator or The Human Disasters?  #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the season of The Predator on steroids. He'll be throwing food &amp; inappropriate love-bombing gestures at his following of toxic-monkeys to get sex, acceptance, hero-worshipping &amp; to solidify his toxic bonding with nasty &amp; co-dependent people. #Thanksgiving #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator creates &amp; manages a specialized niche of mentally-ill &amp; toxic people, including his own children, that he controls through fulfilling their sick, lowly, co-dependent, using life-style needs by love-bombing, flattering, mirroring &amp; enabling bad behaviors. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator puts out his "love-bombing fishing-line" to almost anyone &amp; then fantasy-idealizes the one who gets caught up in the love-bombing &amp; gives him sex; no matter how nasty &amp; lowly the sex-target is, he fantasy-idealizes when he gets sex. #TraderJoes  #NorthCountySanDiego<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator never learns: cause &amp; effect. He love-bombs for sex, immediately turns the sex into a toxic relationship, everything turns ugly &amp; nasty, he denies responsibility, blame-shifts, stonewalls, &amp; finds a new sex target. Repeat for decades. #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He #lovebombs most anyone to get sex; no standards. As soon as someone gives him sex, he suffocates the person, taking up all their time &amp; energy. He soon turns into the taker, lovebombs the monkeys, pits the monkeys against the sex-target &amp; creates chaos &amp; hell. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hypocrisy &amp; Flattery are the two true evils &amp; The Predator's main tools to keep the monkeys &amp; sex-targets engaged in his evil &amp; lowly life. His words don't match his actions &amp; he love-bombs (flatters) to people-please &amp; to get sex, attention &amp; admiration.  #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator grooms &amp; seduces people for sex, admiration &amp; hero-worshipping by being overly generous &amp; attentive. He uses Fawning as a tool to get sex &amp; attention. #RedFlag: Fawning &amp; when the act of generosity doesn't fit the situation or the relationship. #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You have no idea how sick you really are until you've been away from the predator's chaos for awhile. The Predator groomed &amp; fawned after most anyone. No focus, no goals, no purpose, no responsibility, no loyalty, no nothing. Nothing but sickness &amp; chaos.  #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator grooms women for sex. He morphs into your Savior, the best guy ever, your best friend, perfect in every way .. If it's too good to be true, it probably is.

<|startoftext|>This is the sad state of Humanity. No one is important anymore because there's just too many of us &amp; we're all on social media hooking up, being Instagram "models," &amp; relationship jumping with people we shouldn't even be in contact with thanks to social media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are people-pleasing narcissists and people-pleasing empaths. The difference: Intention.

<|startoftext|>Porn addicts are creepy, unfocused, scattered, lazy, frustrated, disorganized, lost, angry, jittery, depressed, but most of all, they're in a state of delusional fog where they think porn is real &amp; all women should jump &amp; scream when having sex.  #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"We shall people our path with demons of our own breeding" (The Cosmo, 47). The Predator's monkeys, using exes, narcissistic family members &amp; sex targets. And opposite The Predator's Fantasy-Idealization Delusions that everyone who shows up for his love-bombing is "amazing."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator morphs into whatever sex-target or monkey is in his presence. A drug-addicted party-sex-scum. Yep. A Buddhist? Yep. Fundamental Christian? Yes. Into short, boxy women? Yes. Into tall, lean women? Yes. Into the "natural look." Yes. Into heavy makeup? Yep. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator is a sex &amp; love-bombing monster who claims to come from a good family. Not true. It's the same fantasy-idealization - his "amazing family" - that he has towards his sex-targets &amp; monkeys. Anyone who's in or around his life must be "great" because, well, he's "great."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator has absolutely no S-E-L-F. His entire life-energy comes from love-bombing a potential sex-target or monkey to approve of him; and the sleazier the monkey or sex-target is, the more he is neurotically driven to people-please.  #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is how they get their monkeys and sex targets. The Predator is The Grand Gesture King. Nothing real, nothing loyal, nothing trustworthy &amp; solid beyond "making an impression" &amp; "being the hero."  #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The Predator replaces people like a car. When they're no longer cheap, easy, fun, giving him a thrill, taking him for a ride, getting him attention, moving him from one lowly place to the next, he looks for another cheap replacement. #TraderJoes #Oceanside  #SeductiveSunday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Birds know when to fly south to avoid the winter blast; beavers know the exact angle in which to construct a dam; the bees build their hexagon cell home to geometrical perfection; the snail fashions its house in an accurate, beautiful spiral: The Predator screws everyone.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HeSays2me @mysociopath is my confidant. She understands this insanity more than anyone that I've ever talked with and charges way less than most. Don't know why she doesn't promote her work more???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator baits sex targets &amp; monkeys in with excessive attention, food, fawning &amp; inappropriate favors &amp; when he gets these people addicted to his offerings, he discards them to return to sexualizing &amp; partying with his old children &amp; using exes.  #TraderJoes  #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DianeLadylaw Skinny "beautiful," so true. The Predator's "criteria" for a sex-target: Under 140lbs. But every woman he grooms for sex is an obvious loser &amp; user, needs to be supported, is dumb, manipulative, shallow, desperate, has layers of makeup on &amp; over-processed hair. Like attracts Like<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perfect way to put it. It's pure evil. Nothing real: all just filling the void with nonsense attention, validation, grooming &amp; conquering lowly sex-targets, manipulating horrible people to admire you, dumb sex &amp; party-time. All just to escape the Self. Absolutely No Goals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator thinks all his sex-targets are prizes even though most are low-lifes, manipulative &amp; using. This is the Fantasy Idealization stage of the Narcissist's Corrupt, Perverted &amp; Delusional Mind. He thinks anyone who f*cks him is a reflection of his "amazingness."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator can't spend 1-sec alone. He goes from one toxic relationship right into the next; never taking a break, never evolving or doing anything worthwhile; never becoming an interesting person on his own without reflecting &amp; copying the sex-target he's grooming for sex.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#IMustBeOldBecause I'm over dating the old man, thinking he's evolved, when he's broke becuz he's on viagra &amp; desperate to appear young &amp; parties w/ &amp; love-bombs his old kids, using exes &amp; every woman who looks his way &amp; he thinks becuz he got me, he can get anyone.  #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#IMustBeOldBecause I'm not flattered by men who flatter, seduce, love-bomb &amp; groom me for sex &amp; attention.

<|startoftext|>The old man, younger woman isn't what you think. You won't be treated like a princess.

<|startoftext|>"My Friend" = Sex Target/Nasty Monkey. "I love my kids" = I "date" &amp; sexualize them, trained them to party with me, mooch off of others, be co-dependent &amp; all so I don't have to spend one-second alone.

<|startoftext|>Hypocrisy: "I'm a musician, a composer," yet he's never composed anything, can't spend 1-second alone, seeks people out all day long - flattering &amp; grooming for sex &amp; attention - partying with &amp; enabling evil, so evil approves of him.  #TraderJoes  #Oceanside  #redflagwarning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hypocrisy: Nothing adds up in his life.

<|startoftext|>I found hundreds of names of women he was preying after for sex &amp; his detailed seduction plans. I took pics &amp; sent them to him so he couldn't grab them from me. Now?

<|startoftext|>Say No! to #SeductiveSunday Seduction is the Number One tool the #Predator uses to groom people to have sex with him &amp; to be part of his toxic flying monkey clan.

<|startoftext|>The Dangers of The Predator &amp; Spirituality. His version of "spirituality" is no accountability, no connection, no organization, no expectation, no focus: Nothing but grooming, partying, enabling evil, lusting, seduction, having sex.   #TraderJoes #SeductiveSunday #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Narcissists triangulate to be the most loved, admired &amp; sought after in the group. They control the group by playing the victim of bad women &amp; then by manipulating themselves into the role of the trusted confidant, the fun &amp; the great guy. This gives them constant sex-ego supply.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MakeAmericaCleanAgain get rid of everything that makes people creepy &amp; demented: Facebook, selfies, social media, porn-sites, Instagram, SmartPhones, dead animal eating, breeders (animal &amp; human), cheap plastic, #TraderJoes crew-dudes using their job to get sex .... #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good that you got away. He'd throw you under the bus at any moment to make his daughter happy.

<|startoftext|>The Predator purposefully held his now old children back from advancing in life &amp; actually encouraged them to party &amp; mooch.

<|startoftext|>@wifeofthenarc @jjuliejust @HeSays2me Get out. What a scumbag .... all lowly desires and nothing higher level going on; so 1979. Geesh. I'm so done with our perverted, corrupt society. I refuse to play along anymore. The Predator did the same with me. I can't believe I was that crazy to go along with it. So toxic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Being Self-Sufficient is the key. The Predator targets, grooms, seduces, love-bombs women who are not self-sufficient. Every now &amp; then he hits a self-sufficient woman - just becuz of the sheer quantity of women he goes after - &amp; it blows up in a few days. #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator lives for the chase &amp; once the chase is over, his true nature emerges: cruel, lying, two-face, back-stabbing, enabling &amp; supporting evil, sex-food-shopping-attention addict, gross people-pleaser, disloyal, lack of character, backbone, morality #TraderJoes  #Oceanside<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SeaBreeze1310 Thank goodness you didn't sell your property. There are so many people, abused by narcissist-sociopaths, who are left with absolutely nothing. It makes me cringe. I'd rather live in a shack, on my own, then be involved in a toxic relationship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I promise you that the more you practice being free &amp; independent, the more you realize how toxic your life was with the narcissist &amp; the more happy you feel everyday; despite your struggles as a single person.

<|startoftext|>The Predators entire sense of "self" comes from getting someone, anyone, to be taken in by his grandiose love-bombing and then to have sex with him. What a living hell ... #TraderJoes  #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ThingsWeAreNeverMeantToKnow that there's a guy working at a "friendly" grocery store who collects contact info of the customers to see how many he can trick into having sex with him. #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The Predator was so exhausting to be around.

<|startoftext|>#My1stLoveWas my high school sweetheart. He turned out to be a good guy. After him, nothing but creepy sociopathic predators. Perhaps we're suppose to stay with our high school sweetheart? #TraderJoes #Oceanside,<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Most therapists aren't fit to be in the profession. They gravitate toward this field because they're trying to fix something in themselves. And most don't have a clue about narcissist personality disorder &amp; fall for their "victim act." The Predator grooms &amp; seduces his therapists<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#IKnowMyPartnerIsMadWhen he's trying to get anyone that moves to have sex with him. Oh that's right, never mind, he does that when he's not mad.   #TraderJoes  #Predator<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sociopaths try to get you before you get them. Just like us, the #narcissist comes from a dysfunctional family (they're delusional &amp; don't admit to the full sickness of their family). They play their trauma out as perpetrator; we play our trauma out as victim.  #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator leads a lowly lifestyle: sex, food, shopping, party-time, playtime, hookups, love-bombing bad people, repeatedly marrying &amp; breeding. What on earth was I thinking? He even teaches his adult children to be lowly. #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Repent, Restitution, Reformation. The 3 "Rs". The sociopath-narcissist does none of them. He simply moves on to find someone else to love-bomb, groom, have sex with, devalue &amp; destroy. Cycle repeats forever. No growth, no evolution.  #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#IWasBornWithout common-sense &amp; boundaries &amp; no matter the hundreds of #RedFlags the #TraderJoes #Predator waved that he was a #sexual predator, I fell for the love-bombing.   #Oceanside<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Oh, you sound just like The Predator, Narcissist-Sociopath in my life. He said the same ... seriously.  #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #Narcissist gets married, repeatedly, becuz he's bored w/ himself &amp; lives in a delusional fantasy-idealization that marriage is all eating, playing &amp; sex - no responsibility, loyalty, integrity &amp; maturity required. They're stuck as 6-yr olds &amp; think it's playtime. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator is a dead entity &amp; only appears to be alive when he's love-bombing a sex-target, almost getting sex, getting sex, or enabling his toxic monkeys to "like" him. Oh, and when I complimented him.  #Narcissist  #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator contradicted everything I said. It was exhausting. And he'd act as if he didn't understand what a 5 yr old would: "Ah, you really shouldn't try to have sex w/ everything that moves: Ah, you shouldn't send my nude images to your co-predators... #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#FunFactFriday #RedFlag #LoveBombing If he's way into you, way too quickly, it's not because you're so amazing, it's because you made yourself way too available, too quickly &amp; you lost track of your life's mission.

<|startoftext|>The Predator has far too much time on his hands to feed his lowly desires, his monkeys' lowly desires &amp; his sex targets' lowly desires. I would suggest he take a second job but then he'd only find more sex targets and monkeys. No win, ever.  #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator depleted every cell of my being. He needed constant attention, constant stimulation, constant activity, constant fawning, constant love-bombing &amp; people-pleasing; &amp; it didn't matter with who or from. We feed these monsters until we're sick.  #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's all about looking good. They'd rather impress a stranger than be loyal to their loved one or family member. They're the shallowest &amp; most superficial monsters on this planet. They don't care about anything or anyone.  #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They're empty shells, voids. And only seem to be "alive" when they're getting attention, admiration &amp; when their love-bombed sex-target or monkey is handing over supply. If they're not getting attention or don't have a new sex target on the line, they actually feel "depressed."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator has absolutely no self-discipline or ability to focus (other than love-bombing inappropriate gestures upon random people).

<|startoftext|>@WhatsGoodatTJs There's a super good Predator at your #Oceanside location. Can we all write a review on him?

<|startoftext|>#DeleteFacebook It's a narcissist-sociopath stomping ground to present their best of all fake images, fake love-partners, fake smiley faces, fake happiness, fake "I found a new love, I'm loved, you were the problem, not me (oh wait, I went ahead and trapped myself again, smile)"<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I bought a small, but clean &amp; sturdy mobile-home on my own little piece of land, on top of a hill, with a view &amp; a breeze &amp; it doesn't look like much for those living in misery &amp; stress, paycheck to paycheck &amp; just to maintain that certain "image." Me? I'm happy &amp; free.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@psychdr100 Oh, but where's the strange looking, plastic, altered, lifted &amp; pulled, puppet-feline transforming, shallow &amp; materialistic "wife?"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The narcissist-sociopath doesn't enter therapy to get better or to see his family's toxic pattern, they enter therapy to prove to the therapist that they're the good one, the right one &amp; you're the bad one for reacting to their abuse. #MentalHealthAwarenessWeek #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MentalHealthAwarenessWeek Do not force a narcissist-sociopath into therapy. They manipulate the therapist, reverse victim &amp; predator &amp; use our normal reactions (angry texts; voicemails), to prove that we're the "bad one." Many therapists are dangerous. #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Copying someone but I have to repeat: I now know why Twitter doesn't stress me out as much as Facebook: No selfies; and no "look at 'the love of my life,' we're so happy together, we're perfect" narcissistic, crazy, delusional nonsense. Thank you, Twitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ICalledInSickBecause the Narcissist-Sociopath tired me out: manipulated me to have sex w/ him, fake a bunch of orgasms just to get it over with, entertain &amp; satiate him or else he would love-bomb an ex to get sex &amp; attention; but "she's just a friend." #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>... &amp; the Narcissist-Sociopath will love-bomb waitresses, coffee pour-ers, sales-people, hostesses, bartenders, anyone with a vagina, a penis, a mouth, a butt...  Narcissist-Sociopaths have to be the most loved, the most admired, the most hero-worshiped...they have no standards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love-bombing is an attempt to influence a person by extreme demonstrations of attention &amp; affection.   The Narcissist-Sociopath will love-bomb his toxic monkeys, past &amp; future sex-targets, co-workers &amp; managers &amp; their own children.   #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator is a master psychological manipulator. He hones in on weak needy desperate lonely people &amp; love-bombs their desires. Free food, fun, moving &amp; handyman services. If you're a Christian, he'll take you to every Christian event in town. If you're a Buddhist.. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You're mistaken; Let's be friends; I'm friends with all my exes; I didn't lose my job &amp; get sued for sexually harassing dozens of women - they're angry because they couldn't have me; I'm not a porn addict; Women in Porn &amp; on Tinder are amazing; I only get the best women ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ThingsYouShouldntQuestion a Narcissist-Sociopath: I didn't do it; It didn't happen; She's my friend; My angry-crazy ex; I only had sex with 3 diff women; I love my kids even though I taught them to party with me, have sex, not take responsibility &amp; mooch. #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CookieKL oh no. I'd "unfriend" or at the least, "mute".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CookieKL agree...I'm to the point of actually feeling repulsed by selfies. I think that disgusting, narcissistic trend is over ... hopefully. And I hope Facebook goes under; it's nothing but advertisement now anyway. Not to mention, it's the ruination of the world.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@grow_your_wings No.  This is absolutely not okay.  She is enabling him for her own convenience &amp; satisfaction. She needs to get a job at a competing restaurant and put him out of business.

<|startoftext|>Think of the living hell of narcissists whose entire self-esteem, sense-of-self, depends on not accomplishing great &amp; profound things, but how insignificant &amp; even downright lowlife people perceive them.  #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't think they set-out to try to be disrespectful; they just don't have respect for anyone. It may look as if they have respect for some, but those people are their monkeys or a potential sex target; basically, people who enable them &amp; who they're somehow benefiting from.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chiwawastew They're dummies, really they are. They're so delusional that they don't even know what a real, healthy, co-creating, co-evolving relationship is. The Predator is so delusional that he thinks anyone who shows up for a free meal &amp; smiles while eating free food, is amazing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Predatory behavior is generational: it runs through entire family networks of other predators, narcissists &amp; psychopaths &amp; they all cover for, support, enable &amp; aid&amp;abet one another. It can even be traced back to the main family sicko who lead it up.  #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You must not take it personal. The Predator has a new sex-target, "love of my life, she's amazing, delightful, what a treat, I'm marrying her," haha, every year or so. He's a predatory psychopath &amp; if it weren't for his love-bombing, he'd be in jail. #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TraderJoes first-mates, captains, whatever, knows he's a predator; #Eric even helped him prey, &amp; yet they allow it becuz he agrees to work the shifts/days no one else wants &amp; works off the clock at close to make the closing mgr look good. #BressiRanch #Oceanside #MeToo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They do so many terrible things to you that you lose track, forget &amp; simply can't keep up with them all.

<|startoftext|>#ThatsWhenIBlewTheWhistle when The Predator ingratiated himself to first-mates, lied on his application &amp; used #TraderJoes, my store, my safe place, as his grounds to stalk for sex, all the while playing innocent spiritual yogi boy, unlucky in love, just looking for a girlfriend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AllTrespassersWillBe love-bombed, ingratiated, seduced &amp; cultivated by The Predator &amp; then after groomed into a place of love-bombed complacency, will be thrown to his screaming &amp; vile monkeys &amp; the next low-life sex-target who walks past him. #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Not normal or even healthy. If someone blew away my brother while he was in his own home, eating ice cream, because they were distracted doing their low-life sexting to a married loser guy; Ah, NO forgiveness. "No Consequences &amp; Accountability" is why our world is psychopathic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the season where The Predator is the most dangerous. Not that he could ever spend 1-second alone, but now we're in the Season of Familial Toxic Dysfunction disguised as "I love my children/family." Nope. He has predatory sexualized inappropriate sick ties to his family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's October. The Predator becomes even more desperate for attention &amp; chases even more sex. This is his season to prey on the desperate, lonely, struggling &amp; pull out all his love-bombing feeding gifting decorating partying parading orgy hedonistic creepy maneuvers. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NationalBoyfriendDay no thank you. I'd rather be free, independent, self-sufficient, stress-free, untrapped than be with a creep who's addicted to social media &amp; porn-sites &amp; emoji-ing &amp; chatten' w/ anything that moves so he feels "good" about himself. #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peaceblitz @BerylGonePink Yes, pretending to be happy. Men pretend more and better than women. Men would rather play with 24 year olds, no responsibility, no bitching, or play with the guys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Typical. I wonder if their husbands feels the same?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peaceblitz No. Those who claim to be "happily married" are not very smart, are lying to themselves or don't think for themselves. Most people are miserably married after the the 1-3 yr "honeymoon period." Affairs, boredom, feeling trap, leading unfulfilled lives, loss of independence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator is on a constant, spinning search outside himself to find the one sex-object that'll "complete him &amp; fix everything."  The search never ends because no one - nothing external - can ever satiate his internal discontent, void &amp; emptiness.  #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ThingsIDontDoVeryWell Deal with predatory people in our largely predatory society.   #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not true. The Predator gets more desperate with age &amp; has refined his numbers game &amp; love-bombing &amp; becuz he's older, his sex targets &amp; monkeys don't suspect it &amp; feel safe. He cries in a poor, little innocent boy way, "angry ex, just looking for a girlfriend." Who would suspect?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've finally come to the realization that this crazy man &amp; "love" thing is ridiculousness. We're living in a culture, at a time, where these men (&amp; women) are hooking up around the clock with anything that moves - thanks to the smart phone &amp; dating &amp; porn sites. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When The Predator was delusionally obsessed w/ fantasy-idealizing all his lowlife, using, loser, mooching sex-targets, exes &amp; monkeys &amp; I'd refuse to comply with his fantasy-delusions, he went insanely angry.

<|startoftext|>The narcissist-sociopath lead entire lives of bullshit, everything they say &amp; do is bullshit, they are bullshit &amp; all their sex targets &amp; monkeys sell their soul for this bullshit. l got better things to do; let them all drown in their own groomed, love-bombed crap-filled lives.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MyLifeWithAVamp Only one read "My Sociopath - An Empath's Soul Journey ...." Re-reading it. Great.

<|startoftext|>@davephillips418 this is the new age "woo woo spiritualist," nonsense. It's repeated by robots of the woo woo culture who lack independent thought, critical thinking skills &amp; who would prefer if we all just walked around in a fog, having sex &amp; playing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator is a throwback both on the evolutionary scale &amp; to another hedonistic &amp; communal living era. He attracts &amp; teaches people (&amp; his aging kids) to be co-dependent, mooch &amp; to lie around eating, partying, ingratiating, having sex &amp; breeding.#TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Red Flag Summary: Anyone who latches on to you too quickly, flatters &amp; charms you, fawns over you, &amp; who bestows inappropriate &amp; excessive gestures on you.

<|startoftext|>I'm one of the only women in town that didn't breed with this damn creep. I can't imagine having kids with these sickos. Hats off to anyone who's stuck dealing with them because of the kids. I'd be in jail ... #TraderJoes #Oceanside #YouKnowItsAllBadWhen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If we'd only stop using labels: narcissist, sociopath, bpd, psychopath &amp; call it what it is: creepy perv predator gross dirty lowlife-loser mentally-ill delusional wasted-life dumb-ass...we'd likely not stay hooked because of their stupid love-bombing . #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#YouKnowItsAllBadWhen he's 60s, has many kids w/ many women, encourages his old kids to party &amp; mooch, never had a healthy relationship - it's everyone else's fault, tells you he's "just looking for a girlfriend, is on the Buddhist Lay Path" &amp; wants to marry you w/out knowing you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And The Predator's opinion of me depends on whether or not I fawn over him, admire him, repeat meaningless, shallow, dumb words he wants to hear, party on the streets with him, gluttonously eat with him, &amp; give him fake, loud, screaming, porn-like orgasms. #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Keep right on reacting to these monsters, despite their slander. Start training yourself to laugh in the face of their slander and their vile monkeys who support these creeps. When you're doing your own good work, you could care less about these disgusting people. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know he's a mentally ill delusional sex perv addict predator when he says women in porn are great, enjoy sex &amp; their 10,000 fake orgasms in 5 min are real. No wonder truly good women think they have to fake circus jump &amp; stupidly scream to please these creeps. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AFirstDateBecomesTheLastWhen he love-bombs me; tells me that he wants to marry me when he barely knows me; tells me he's been married 4x &amp; has 6 kids by 3 different women but yet all his exes are "angry or crazy or frigid.." &amp; he parties with his kids ... #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Women don't protect other women. Crazier yet, when a woman tries to warn other women that the man she is with is abusive, or a predator, or a liar, she's attacked &amp; the abuser is defended &amp; considered more desirable.  #TraderJoes #Predator #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If a woman get righteously angry she's called "crazy" or a "bitch." If a man gets angry, for any reason, he's desired and chased after by these "crazy, bitches" for being a "sexy, bad boy."  #Oceanside #TraderJoes #Predator<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SeductiveSunday Honestly! No! That's all the @TraderJoes Predator does is seduce seduce &amp; seduce. He seduces his own old children for goodness sake. It's called love-bombing &amp; it's shallow &amp; manipulative! He has zero personality: all eating, feeding, f*cking, fawning. #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wifeofthenarc They're severely mentally ill. We can label them any psycho-babble term that makes us comfortable from narcissist, to NPD, to sociopath, to psychopath, to predator. Bottom line is they're mentally ill sexual deviants &amp; if they didn't know how to love-bomb, they'd be locked up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator is preoccupied &amp; obsessed with his own d*ck &amp; showing it off, porn, pleasing trashy &amp; vile women, having sex with (conquering) just about anyone. I asked him if he was sexually abused as a child; he said "no." I wonder if sexual-deviants lie about this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DivaSophie1 @STFUImTweetn0_o @ResisterSiano I'm the same. Good for you. I don't care about "follower numbers:" yes I care about authentic, good followers, a give &amp; take with our "hearting", re-tweeting, supporting, but past that, I refuse to be caught up in the numbers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do this. I over-explain and think I have to answer any question from just about anyone. It stems from childhood abuse and neglect. I don't understand boundaries because my parents didn't allow me to have any boundaries. I'm working on this very thing right now: talk less.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He slandered &amp; headed me off when I threatened to come forth @TraderJoesRants @Trader_Joes3665. I feel free to be out of here &amp; now I'll regain my power, despite his slander, while holding the predator lists high in the air. Oh, many of the names are #TraderJoes customers&amp;workers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I first moved in with The Predator, I found piles of predator lists &amp; notes that he kept on who he was prowling after &amp; the seduction &amp; grooming tricks he was trying. Now: I'm leaving &amp; found even more. He thought he grabbed all of it out of here. #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is it that every single person who claims to be spiritual, or Buddhist, or a yogi is creepy, perverted, uneducated, predatory, sex-addicted, narcissistic, psychopathic &amp; just overall insane &amp; evil? #SundayThoughts #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator has repeated the exact same experience, over &amp; over, with the same results: screaming children, monkeys &amp; targets, destruction &amp; ruin. Love-bomb, f*ck, party all over again. #TraderJoes #Predator  #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And you'll find proof of his predatory life-style long before this supposed "solid, married guy" realized that it was his 5th wife who was the "bad one, the cheater" and oh, he was such a "good husband but she gave him STDs." Everything they say is a lie! #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Their crazy goes so deep &amp; they lie, play innocent &amp; spiritual so well, that we'll never know how totally morally corrupt &amp; demented they really are.

<|startoftext|>@AnneTownsend007 haha, thank you. or, ptsd typo?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator secures a half-descent supply source in place; meaning she's not absolutely homeless &amp; has all her limbs. He then seduces his children &amp; exes back into party-land. Finally, he hunts down really really trashy, filthy, gross sex on the streets. #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator is such a predator that he seduces women with partners &amp; gets her to say that his d*ck is better than the other guy's d*ck.

<|startoftext|>Predator destroyed another family w/ many children &amp; a whole resort w/ sexual harassment charges. What's the 1st thing he did after, you may ask?

Get out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I call him The Predator because 3 different of his vile monkeys @ different times pulled me aside in confidence &amp; said, "You know he's a predator, don't you?" When I confronted him w/ this: his usual dead eyes went deader &amp; he accused me of making it up. #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RamblingsRosie @birdi79363642 The Predator actually targets older women because he knows they're more trusting, vulnerable &amp; many are struggling financially, emotionally, psychologically (divorce, older kids at home, sickness, job loss, poverty.) And many are just desperate for attention &amp; to be loved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If women had pride &amp; refused to be back-up sex &amp; admiration monkeys to these creeps, then these psychos couldn't go so easily from triangulating, smearing, slandering &amp; destroying one sex-target after the next. Women need to stand for &amp; believe other women! #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have learned, the hard way, to run away from dead-eye, dead-brain, dead-monotone-speech self-proclaimed yogis, Buddhist or spiritualist wearing yoga clothes with all their cracks showing &amp; blah-blahing "brotherly love" as they lie around having sex &amp; being creepy. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator love-bombs his exes to stay "friends" with him so that he keeps a link to desperate, aging women "admiring" him (&amp; they gotta keep their freebies coming) &amp; giving him backup sex but to use "I'm friends with my exes" to look like a Good Samaritan with the new targets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you don't fawn over &amp; pretend to be a submissive, mindless lowly-sex whackjob, with a creepy guy you just met who's telling you how perfect you are &amp; wants to marry you two-weeks after meeting you. #SignsYouAreAnAdult #TraderJoes #Oceanside #SeductiveSunday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Let's be friends," says The Predator. No! In Psycho Language this mean, "Let's be friends with benefits &amp; you will continue to admire me &amp; give me sex when yet another one of my new, love-bombed hell-hole thing I call a "relationship" goes to sh*t." #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As soon as the predator secures his new sex &amp; ego supply into place, he revisits his crazy, using exes to seduce them back under his control &amp; returns to party w/ his old children to ensure that they're still his fun &amp; gratifying play &amp; sex-objects. #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're going to play submissive, doting &amp; fawning with a guy you barely know &amp; think it's a compliment that he's love-bombing you &amp; telling you how "perfect" you are when he doesn't even know you, then you are setting yourself up for a nightmare. #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@heart_uf_a_king @lava_like haha, good point. I'll have to think about his one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator had Narcissist Collapse when he got caught being a predator &amp; then lying &amp; when he was no longer the center of attention, he pretended to be delusional, sucked his children into the drama &amp; then found a monkey psychologist who diagnosed him w/ depression.#TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theiceman6752 You were right. There is no good stuff to be given or received in a relationship ... any longer.

<|startoftext|>The Predator has no boundaries &amp; he targets sex supply &amp; monkeys who don't have boundaries. If you put up a boundary, the predator will gaslight you, throw you under the bus, smear you, triangulate you &amp; immediately go out on the hunt for sex &amp; attention. #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grow_your_wings @RossRosenberg1 They never ever take boundaries. They only target people without boundaries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They just want sex &amp; to be the center of attention amongst a vile bunch of loser sex targets, exes and monkeys. That's all.

<|startoftext|>@ADivorcing @NarcissistTarg1 I think it's better than "no contact:" they should have consequences just like everyone else. No contact allows them to go on &amp; keep abusing. This type of abuse is generational: their sons &amp; daughters are just as narcissistic, entitled, abusive &amp; mooching. #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ADivorcing @NarcissistTarg1 I did this too. I don't know why it's not recommended over "no contact?" I came after the bastard...made him accountable for every evil thing he did. This is the only way these predators are ever going to stop their destruction: It's up to us to hold them accountable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TracyCampanell I miss the love-bombing. Doesn't say a lot for me, or anyone who falls for love-bombing. Love-bombing is shallow, materialist, superficial &amp; meaningless. There should be classes starting in 7th grade that teaches young people the red-flags of toxic beginnings to a relationship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator has no internal power of 'a self:' he's a void who mirrors all his monkeys to be "liked." All his energy comes through outside attention &amp; sex. He has nothing real to offer, anyone, so he gauges his "worth" by getting lowly women to compliment his penis. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BAB1EDOLL Gross.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's simplify the psycho-babble: They're sex addicts &amp; mentally deranged nutcases who lie, flatter, groom, love-bomb, seduce &amp; throw anyone, even their own children, under the bus to get to their next sex and attention source. #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Melfyboom @NarcissistBox The only way you get through this is to do good things in your own life, to improve yourself &amp; your future; to help, if can at this time in your life &amp; in the smallest of ways, your loved ones &amp; pets. You have to move yourself forward &amp; leave the sociopath to his own destruction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LynnMil03495111 Nice work. Good one.:)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love bombing; quickly and immediately falling in "love" with you (no, it's not love, you're not that special; it's lust &amp; they're horny). Quick, rushed - everything's really quick. Inappropriate &amp; excessive gestures &amp; favors. A lot of compliments, flattery. #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They expect loyalty &amp; dedication, but don't have a loyal or dedicated bone in their body; they expect us to be honest, but all they do is lie. They're mentally ill nutcases who should be locked up but because they know how to seduce, charm &amp; love-bomb, they escape consequences.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not just young women. He also targets desperate women between 50-72 years old. It's like nothing you'll ever see. He's the best &amp; most manipulative love-bomber &amp; groomer on the planet. He actually told me that he "grooms" people.  #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DelusionalOptimism The sick consequences of the woo-woo dead-pan, dead-eyed, think positive, I'm a yogi, spiritual movement. #TraderJoes #Predator epitomizes this evil.

<|startoftext|>Predator is getting more sex now than he did in the 1970s. Women, what are you doing? You'll sell your soul for a free meal, latte, handyman service &amp; creepy play &amp; f*cktime w/ a predator who's 70, says he's 58, married 5x &amp; pretends to be inexperienced? #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lava_like @msstaceylace haha, so true. same here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grow_your_wings Remaining anonymous is what gives this evil more power to keep growing. My understanding of this is it's not slander &amp; defamation if you're telling the truth. But to be safe, I gave the predator a "nickname" without revealing his true name, but everyone knows who he is anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TracyCampanell Most men (&amp; women) lack discernment in regards to quality &amp;character of a person. Men confuse lust, the wild love-bombing, fake orgasm, 'I'll tell you anything you want to hear, I'm wearing a mask of my best behavior to trap you', stage as something real &amp; lasting. Delusional.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#explosion of evil. "Delusional Optimism." How evil spreads. We've been brainwashed to think we have to rise above our corrupt society, stay quiet, just smile, &amp; go "no contact" to be the better one; oh, add in the manufactured addiction to the internet. #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@omg_a_llama I hope it works for you. My concern is any brain, body altering chemical.

<|startoftext|>@birdi79363642 @TraderJoesRants Yay. I'm so happy for you. It takes a lot of good, hard work but we make it to our freedom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He rescues bad &amp; nasty people. In exchange, these nasties do his bidding &amp; slaughter any sex target that tries to stand up to him. He even groomed his own children: he's their rescuer &amp; he encourages them to mooch &amp; party &amp; be vile. #TraderJoes #Oceanside #VistaWay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atwistonlife I love it. Stealing that phrase. Will be using it all the time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He incites people who've never had a bad dealing with one another to hate each other.

No wonder Americans are all sick.   #TraderJoes #Predator #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He controls foul people by rescuing them. His sex targets &amp; monkeys are terrible people &amp; use &amp; abuse him as well. It's an exchange of human vileness at its lowest form. He even trained his now old children to be bad so that he can keep his position as rescuer in their bad lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No boundaries &amp; rescuing horrible people from their bad behaviors &amp; the consequences which would teach them to be better, is what creates generations and networks of narcissists &amp; sociopaths. The #TraderJoes #Predator controls vile people by becoming their rescuer. #Oceanside  https://t.co/fwsjCuMtha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator takes you on a whirlwind love-bombing trip. It's not real: all feeding, f*cking, partying &amp; words that don't match reality. He targets women who have too much time on their hands &amp; will lose not only themselves, but their soul for a lust trip. #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PsychologyDoc True. Good point. Most books are bad but we don't realize it until we're older. Just read this one, spectacular, the author is a head of her time, she makes profound points; a rare treasure. She doesn't even promote it? https://t.co/7dCZag7BuD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They have no roots or discernment; they go where ever the sex and attention is. #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Men are used to thoughtless women who give sex for a free dinner or even less than that: a free cup of coffee. It's the consequences we pay for agreeing to the NSA &amp; FWB movement.

<|startoftext|>The over-sexualized look is so yesteryear. Every woman can pull it off; it's not special. Men will tell you anything to get laid. It all goes downhill after the sex. The #TraderJoes #Predator has absolutely no discernment: he screws anything that allows it. #SeductiveSunday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peaceblitz Thank you. And yes, yes, yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wifeofthenarc @HeSays2me I lose my mind around the love-bombing predator. My mind twists in a rotted knot. If I avoid him for a while - hard at first because I'm addicted to the love-bombing - but after a few weeks, I start waking up out of "mental illness." These guys cause us to be mentally ill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't have sex. Don't get trapped in a relationship. Don't ruin your life for a temporary man. Study, work hard at something you love, save your money &amp; don't give it away to men, buy your own home, cash, even if it's a tent or RV, be free &amp; save animals. #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No contact doesn't solve anything, it doesn't work. It only propagates the evil &amp; harm. I stand in truth, always, &amp; I speak out against the predator as often as the opportunity allows: whenever one of his vile monkeys bullies me on his behalf. Watch me go. #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@STFUImTweetn0_o oh, how strange, you read my mind. Exact same sentiment on the exact same day. I'm going to set my life up to where I hide as much as humanely possible from people ... no more interaction, no more dealings, yep, I'm going to try to live self-contained.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealCasey77 The sexual predator in my life agreed to go to counseling. He then proceeded to manipulate the counselor and win her over. He's now the victim and woman after woman is the abuser. Yep, right. I'm reporting her to as many places as I can. Zero Tolerance. #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wifeofthenarc @AfterTheNarc MIL, those are abuse tactics. Shutting you down, gaslighting you and all under manipulative and controlling rhetoric, "has to be uplifting and respectful." Then she is condoning lying and abuse.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@peaceblitz "moral rot," perfect description<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>He's nothing but love-bombing death with a penis.  #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator is dumb in all matters except for how to flatter, manipulate, people-please &amp; groom monkeys &amp; sex targets. All he thinks about is who to groom, conquer, make like him &amp; who he has to have sex with so he feels "okay" about his miserable self. #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sterling2143 @grow_your_wings @selfcarehaven haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Predator throws his target under the bus for the flying monkey. He doesn't give a damn bout protecting his target; she's disposable, easily replaceable. Monkeys are most important: his shallow image: impressing, winning-over, grooming vile low-lifes to approve of him. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone that has to announce that they're a "good Christian" is anything but. Truly good and authentic people are too busy doing Service Work and have neither the time nor the energy to announce what labels they put on themselves.<|endoftext|>

The real issue: men don't have mothers &amp; fathers, they can't get descent jobs that fill them w/ pride, they can't afford their own place &amp; can't get a descent woman to fill that place. Instead, they go insane on Facebook, porn sites &amp; texting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NSurvivor No. Research says many narcissists think they are empaths. But I can also believe those suffering from early life or even relationship trauma are borderline, extremely sensitive - wounded - and pick up on the wounding of the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NSurvivor I get it. However, current research is alos stating that many who believe they are empaths are actually narcissists. This construct has been circulating in the mental health field for the past couple of years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A person who cannot be constructive despite an opposing view &amp; they shut you down with statements such as: "I think I've had enough," or "I'm done here" or "You do you," is not only manipulative but abusive.

<|startoftext|>Yikes. You're on to something. There are a lot of crazy, whack-job people out there, who act like narcissists but claim to be empaths. Gotta wonder.

<|startoftext|>@RamblingsRosie haha, so true. Me too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sillywithsad Nope. Go all the way. Don't be intimidated or deterred. This is their chance to fight for what's right, no matter what the other side does, &amp; in the process effect change &amp; grow their own wings.  #TraderJoes #Oceanside #SaturdayThoughts<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lhsaapso1 @grow_your_wings They're misogynist.They target women who are down and out ... either permanently or a life-situation. They go after women who they can manipulate, use &amp; control. And in actuality, these women aren't in control of their lives.  They rarely target men. Men become their monkeys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Control The Narrative. When they're pitting their monkeys &amp; targets against you, don't react: stay calm &amp; simply stand by &amp; watch all monkeys &amp; targets go crazy. If we stay out of it, remove ourselves, you'll see that the monkeys, targets &amp; narcissist end up destroying each other<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator grooms people with food, compliments, fawning, free fun days, inappropriate attention, favors &amp; gifts. He grooms the #TraderJoes Captains by working off the clock, taking the worse shifts, buying them lunches &amp; being a "yes" man. #Oceanside @TraderJoesRants<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They require non-stop external attention. They can't spend one second alone. They have no internal ability to self-soothe. They're dead on the inside &amp; any "life" they might feel, comes through shallow exterior sources of attention. They teach their children to be narcissists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MyLifeWithAVamp @grow_your_wings Not taking the vampire analogy too far. It's 100% accurate. They're a bunch of dead people. Let them bury each other. They never grow, evolve, improve. All of them stay "dead" forever: sex, eating, preying, low-lives, broke, users, exploiters, mooches, no autonomy, no freedom..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, "Let the dead bury the dead." It's the evil, low-consciousness Narcissist Network of vile, revolving sex &amp; ego targets &amp; monkeys. They're all dead people living in a cesspool of ugly sex, attention, food, partying, excuses, attacking the innocent for its ugly ring-leader.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You must correct the narcissist's manipulative Narrative. The Predator's Narrative: "Poor little boy, I'm so generous &amp; kind, spiritual, guru, yogi, free loving, unlucky in love, just looking for a girlfriend, sexually innocent, bad &amp; crazy exes." #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always act cool, calm, in control &amp; with dignity. Speak the truth about his manipulations: inform, educate, be a teacher &amp; leader. The #predator keeps control of The Narrative to control the targets &amp; monkeys. Instead, you take control of The Narrative. #TraderJoes #Oceanside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SaturdayMotivation The #narcissist controls the targets &amp; monkeys by supporting their evil &amp; bad.

<|startoftext|>@grow_your_wings I say to the predator &amp; as many people as I can: Nope, not that, not on my watch. Nope, I will not accept that as normal.

<|startoftext|>@AllisonRFloyd @AnneTownsend007 @rabin_c your advice, to ignore, spreads evil.   @AllisonRFloyd is right. The only way to evolve humanity is to spread awareness. It's the only thing that has ever worked.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's up to us to inform. These sickos are covert for a reason. The targets before us didn't have social media, nor the language or construct.

<|startoftext|>@KarenMonahan01 They're delusional.

<|startoftext|>Head monkey yells at us because there's not enough room on her dirty table to place all the dishes.

<|startoftext|>He manipulated me into using my kitchen &amp; cooking a catered meal. Ten hours later &amp; my kitchen in chaos, we hand-deliver eight deluxe party dishes to a house.

<|startoftext|>Sociopaths can't be alone; they're dead on the inside &amp; need constant external validation. They go from one #hell relationship right into the next.

<|startoftext|>The Predator is a black hole that sucks everyone &amp; anyone into his evil &amp; #hell vortex so he feels "alive." He's never alone, always the center of attention. He grooms everyone, even his own children, to eat &amp; f*ck &amp; to party &amp; play with him. He never matured past 12. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's evil disguised as love &amp; he's attracted to evil. His "love" gestures are for control: Inappropriate &amp; excessive attention &amp; financial support. He supports his old children &amp; his old ex wives (who have husbands) so they "like" him &amp; party with him. They abuse him. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Typical Sociopath-Predator: They do what they want, when they want; surround themselves with monkeys who provide false alibis &amp; attack anyone who tries to stand up for themselves; &amp; when it all finally catches up to them, they go into a fake delusion. #EpsteinSuicide #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He stopped maturing around 12. He just want to have sex, party, be the center of attention, couch surf, play on the beach, crash in on people's houses, be financially irresponsible, mooch. He taught his children to be like this. His parents taught him to be like this. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He controls seedy, bad, low-life people (&amp; his old children) by supporting them. In turn, the low-lifes extort from him &amp; abuse him. Essentially: he grooms bad people to get bad people to like him &amp; therefore he reigns The King Of Evil. He creates Control Niches. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's a dead-eye, brainless, so-called "spiritualist" that has no judgment &amp; who grossly perverted the meaning of "love."

<|startoftext|>He's empty on the inside. He needs constant external validation to feel anything ... anything at all. Everyone has to "approve" of him &amp; once his sex target is secured in place, he'll throw her 'under the bus' to keep the monkeys happy.  #TraderJoes @TraderJoesRants<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After a breakup with a psychopath, so many women bounce right into a relationship with the next man who comes along. Not healthy. Learn &amp; grow on your own.

<|startoftext|>Too bad The Predator doesn't teach his monkeys to be better. He just grooms them with fawning, f*cking, partying, eating. Oh that's right, if the monkeys &amp; him were doing good things, growing &amp; evolving, he wouldn't be able to triangulate them against his targets. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Instead of accomplishing something great, Predator manipulated &amp; seduced a nasty couple who's on the HOA.

<|startoftext|>He doesn't have standards. He just obsesses over anyone who shows up &amp; is within a very wide-range: Under 70 ish yrs old, under 145lbs.

<|startoftext|>"He'll get his Karma." Nope ... this is called enabling. Tough-love leads to evolution &amp; slows down the cycle of abuse.

<|startoftext|>Psychopaths attract what's inside of them. The Predator obsesses over making sleazy people "like" him. "Like attracts like." He actually groomed his own children to party with him. Just by the sheer # of people he targets, he hits a good person every now &amp; then. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They reach an older age, 40, 50, 60, 70 &amp; have nothing real or tangible to show for their years.

<|startoftext|>You're always complaining about your so-called "crazy ex" and you play "poor, little victim boy, unlucky in love" really well (coincidentally: as you're seducing other women): I've been wondering what your exes side of the story is?  #TraderJoes #OddThingsToAskACoWorker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>then he tried to force me to stare at "their good looks" all night; &amp; then on the way home, he screamed at me because I didn't agree to fantasy-idealize &amp; obsess over the monkeys.

<|startoftext|>Every half-approachable person he meets becomes his sick obsession to win-over: to flatter, groom, seduce, cultivate &amp; love-bomb...for sex, attention, validation, party-time, distraction-time, creepy time, lust time.

<|startoftext|>He has no real relationships based on respect, communication &amp; honesty. He #lovebombs, seduces &amp; grooms everyone; even his own children.

<|startoftext|>@Sterling2143 Don't do it then. I refuse to allow The #Predator to know he got to me.

<|startoftext|>His monkeys sell their souls for free food &amp; fun days. Not one of them uses their brains to connect-the-dots: a creepy old dude wants to pay your way &amp; he's so "great," but..he can't make a real relationship work, but..all the exes are crazy.

<|startoftext|>@omg_a_llama Yay. Me too. And I'm the only sane one in my group. Probably you too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Then why even date? It's crazy out there. Just focus on developing yourself; creating yourself anew. Go back to school; develop a skill or hobby - get paid for doing something you love; rescue animals or wherever your passions lie; write, dance, sing. Dating is so 2000.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unfortunately, herein lies the problem. He comes across like the "poor, innocent victim of a terrible woman." No one knows he's abusive except for the intimate partner &amp; that's further into the "relationship," past the honeymoon period &amp; the abuse takes place behind closed doors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Adult Bully: He collects sex targets &amp; monkeys &amp; if a sex target happens to stand up for herself, the #narc will smear, triangulate &amp; get the monkeys to beat her up.

<|startoftext|>Obsessed with his own penis. He seduces &amp; #grooms women to have sex w/ him &amp; then coerces them into talking about how great his penis is; how it's better than any penis they've ever had. He sets this all in motion by sending penis shots before. Predators are dumb. #Traderjoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do they marry so often? To seal in the sex source. He's dumb, nothing real or higher going on, so he lives to find new sex-sources that'll complete him, haha.

<|startoftext|>@CAAGed @omg_a_llama No doubt. And they learn from us, our posts and even direct words to them (telling them they're a narcissist &amp; to get help)... how to be better and more covert.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He doesn't love. He's obsessed with manipulating, seducing, grooming others to fall in love with him. He's attracted to sleazy, horrible, awful people who lack morals, values, characters. This "attraction" is a reflection of his own soul &amp; his childhood environment. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Karolin04276290 @sixyearswithap1 Yes, true too. Some can't even mirror the humor-type of their target.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We were on a 1 day camping trip; it was for me. He invited this creepy man who he was obsessed with.

<|startoftext|>@Karolin04276290 @sixyearswithap1 They can joke about themselves if the current sex target jokes about herself or has self-deprecating humor herself. They'll mirror this aspect of a sex target if they're still trying to get more sex from the sex target. Haha, a lot of the "sex" word in this tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's never accomplished anything, his entire life. All he's ever done is #groom people: a lot of sex; quick lust marriages that end badly (trap the sex source into marriage); monkeys eating &amp; drinking everywhere. Even his job @TraderJoesRants : No brains required; just grooming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He becomes sickly obsessed with &amp; delusional over a possible new sex source or monkey. He's superficial, dumb &amp; materialistic &amp; is struck down by shallow displays of possible sex, control, playtime, f*cktime. He thinks it's a challenge even tho the sex source has sex w/ anyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They never have healthy relationships. They choose people who have issues &amp; who they can groom, manipulate &amp; control. If by chance - the sheer number of people they groom - they meet up with someone who "wakes up," they'll get their monkeys to destroy that person. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@omg_a_llama A narcissist doesn't really think anything out. They're all primitive, primal, deviant brain-stem only.

<|startoftext|>@LesleyJon18 So you have your programmed responses ready for different situations?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@omg_a_llama He's charming &amp; crazy. He treats his targets wonderfully, that is until he secured her in place, &amp; then he grows bored, returns to partying with the monkey...the secured in-place target gets mad, he then finds a new target...all the while paying the monkeys to party with him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LesleyJon18 Cool. This looks like where I grew up: Northeast Ohio.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nesting88 Oh my ... he's a master at keeping his "three ring circus of monkey" flying around &amp; bulling targets for him. He's extremely financially irresponsible; no respect for money &amp; he plays the role of "Fun, Party Boy, Let's All Eat &amp; Drink, I'll Flatter &amp; Charm You Like No One else."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nesting88 Good question. I think he may be trying to get a couple of his nasty monkeys incited &amp; to believe he's a "victim," yet again, but even the monkeys know he's crazy &amp; all his relationships blow up fast? And I'm the one w/ criminal &amp; job loss evidence against him? He is delusional?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator kept taking extra money from me. I also gave him my car for 3 mo. I discovered that he was using my money to party with &amp; enable his old children &amp; "make happy" an ex wife - who is already being supported by another man. He secretly recorded my reaction to all this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LesleyJon18 But isn't that what a narcissist does? Confused.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CAAGed  I've never before made the connection between child molesters who groom their targets for sex, the Catholic Priests who are now being held accountable for grooming members of their congregation for sex &amp; The #Predator grooming me &amp; others for sex.

<|startoftext|>@SlowBoiledFrog @Karolin04276290 His toxic monkeys: a bunch of crazy, dysfunctional, low life people, including exes that he called "friends" (haha) &amp; his old children that he was supporting so they'd hang out and party with him. He had low-lifes crawling out of every corner to be love-bombed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A #narcissist may ruin a holiday because they're not the center of attention &amp; people are extra happy on this day. However, there is another type of narcissist, more the predatory type, who aggressively inserts himself as the Great Show Man of Events on holidays. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I found detailed lists where he keeps track of all the women he's trying to "groom" &amp; the different tricks for the different women - based on their interests. He then has follow-up notes on what to try next. He actually uses the word "grooming." #TraderJoes #SaturdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nesting88 haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>His Good Monkeys: Drunk &amp; Drug-Addicted Monkey; Party Monkey; Co-Predator &amp; Pervert Monkey; Using Monkey; Co-Dependent Monkey; Homeless Monkey; Gross Monkey; Abusive Monkey; Bully Monkey His Now Bad &amp; Former Monkey: Intelligent &amp; Independent Monkey.  #SaturdayThoughts #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator doesn't have humor. He only laughs when someone is being duped; even a monkey. 1 time: two of his gross monkeys - 1 monkey called the other monkey a name; he laughed. Another time: a monkey gave the pizza guy $50 tip; she was drunk. Both times, I tried to help monkey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They build a false &amp; mentally damaged brain-construct from a young age. The Predator thinks sleazy &amp; collects sleaziness around him (sex, lust, partying, eating, mooching, co-dependency). He even taught his own children to seek pleasure because this is all he knows himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricaWe77927227 @NorskAmerikans Most are sex addicts &amp; perverts &amp; addicted to porn, hook-ups, lowly women (and men) &amp; the sleazy, hedonistic lifestyle. So they think everyone else is like this too. And because their thought-processing is so demented, they think everyone else thinks the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator is delusional &amp; has schizophrenic episodes. He goes out of his mind trying to keep the false construct; the "I'm a poor, little, innocent, loving boy &amp; she's bad" going. This soothes himself &amp; both satisfies &amp; incites his enablers - he thinks this is a show of love.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How they escape accountability: They trick us by seducing us to fall in love with them &amp; when we discover they're an evil black-hole, they get their monkeys - who are deeply entrenched in the psychopath's seductive offerings - to attack us. #SaturdayThoughts #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good point. But we use terms to connect a concept, a construct, to inform &amp; to teach others...to spread awareness. What other term should be used then? I sometimes use "evil" but these entities are not pure evil ... they have some good &amp; that's why we stay with them for so long.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>6 years of me trying to get him mental health help; 30 years before I ever came along, other people trying to get him help; And now that I finally put a stop to not only his abuses but his monkey abuses; I'm the one that is "crazy &amp; needs help." Yep. #TraderJoes #SaturdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If it weren't evil, it'd be funny: 1 million photos of us together &amp; 2 mil text messages, 1.5 mil of him saying "I ‚ù§Ô∏è you" &amp; now that I'm putting a stop to his &amp; monkey abuse, he says, "We never had a relationship." Yep, these sickos are sick because the monkey's support them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Geesh, it's all so confusing: one day I'm a "treat, a delight, fiance, girlfriend, love of his life," &amp; the next day I'm "the crazy, angry ex." I suppose my status depends on how much sex, attention &amp; fawning I bestow upon his greatness. I think I'm being gaslighted? #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McHenryGmail How do you know she really speaks 6 languages? She can barely speak English and that's the preferred 2nd language of Europeans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#HeardTheScreamAnd knew the Narcissist's monkeys were throwing a fit because the narc abandoned them when he found a new ego source to manipulate, seduce &amp; love-bomb.  #TraderJoes #Predator<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funny how when I was ready &amp; willing to put up with him treating me like Recycle Love-Bomb Ego Source, he called me his fiance but as soon as I put a stop to him &amp; his monkey abuse, I'm now "angry &amp; crazy." And oh, this change in my status happened in 2 minutes. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True. And yes, they're deeply entrenched in narc's manipulation &amp; seduction tactics (yes, the predator even seduces men) and not to mention they sell their soul for the love-bombing. I'm not trying to save them, they're awful people. I'm holding them accountable.  #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nesting88 true .... get your point but I'm still fighting back .... even "fighting" the monkeys .....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He manipulates people to fall in love with him. Once done, he abandons the person &amp; moves onto to someone else; or recycles back-in old love-bombed sources. So here I come into the picture: Do you have any idea how many angry monkeys have attacked me because they felt betrayed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have you ever considered that #NoContact isn't helping the relationship abuse &amp; sociopath epidemic? I refuse to enable him - like all his other former targets &amp; monkeys - who come back around, despite knowing he's evil - to get another dose of his sick love-bombing. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ThatsSomethingYouOnlyDoOnce Think that you're super special because he's moving really fast and love-bombing you. Don't fall for it. #REDFLAG It's gonna end in a nightmare. No one that's special; there's way too many of us &amp; we're all way too sexualized &amp; accessible. #traderjoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, they're spoiled brats and entitled though they have nothing real, nothing good to even proclaim any type of entitlement whatsoever. Not that a sense of "entitlement" is good - whether earned or not - but you know what I mean.:) #traderjoes #NPD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Since humanity is at a low-level of consciousness, I thought I'd spread the word: It's not normal for someone to stand around a store, with cut cardboard &amp; Sharpie saying something like: So your uncle played guitar, well I'm a composer, let me send you my music, what's ur #?"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator exactly. He also employs the ol' "My d*ck is the greatest you've ever seen or experienced...my d*ck is better than your boyfriends/husbands or anyone you've ever had." He sends d*ck pix of himself to most anyone: part of sexual harassment law suit. #TraderJoes  https://t.co/ZPyTdnDpWd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RamblingsRosie Yes, exactly: "little support from the medical profession/law etc." I think we need to get even more assertive, aggressive in stopping this evil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lifebycourage Absolutely normal. Humanity is in chaos. Limit your time on social media &amp; your phone, take a walk with a pet (if you have), and just focus on doing one small thing a day. That's it. One small thing a day leads to 7 things done a week.:) And get lots of sleep &amp; relaxation time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Posted on Quora. The Predator exactly. His sick game is to get women (even men) to fall in love with him, to fantasy-idealize him, to believe he's better than who they're currently with &amp; anyone from their past. Yes, he even goes after women with boyfriends/husbands. #TraderJoes  https://t.co/mYIdqZfSSQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly, The Predator.   #TraderJoes #Predator<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Honestly, what on earth is wrong out there? People will actually sell their soul to be paid attention to, inappropriately love-bombed &amp; flattered, receive a free meal &amp; paid-for fun day &amp; all ... despite The Love-Bomber raising 1 million red-flags. #TraderJoes  #4thofjuly2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They know how to escape accountability; they surround themselves w/ people who enable them. The Predator has a large network of people, monkeys, who he feeds &amp; supports &amp; even tho they know he's terrible, they close their eyes, take his handouts &amp; allow the innocent to be abused<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@devcalm8 Sad and true. We're much more selfish, self-centered when we're younger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's all about focusing on higher goals and ideals: a character trait that the narcissist-sociopath doesn't have.  He's the Fun-F*ck Boy all over town.   #TraderJoes #Predator<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They smear you, head you off, discredit you, play the victim, blame-shift ... and all with their monkeys. Good people don't fall into this trap, nor would a good person bully a person they've never experienced a bad moment with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They also turn their children into play-things, their entertainment, their "boyfriends" and "girlfriends." The Predator actually sexualizes his own children &amp; parties with them. He enables their bad &amp; irresponsible behaviors &amp; actually taught them to mooch off of their mothers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, but what would I know? I'm the 10th crazy or angry ex that she's known of. And oh, I have an M.A. &amp; wrote a well respected book on this subject. And oh, I forgot, I have lists, many lists, of detailed notes he takes about the women he's trying to seduce. I know, I'm crazy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>sexual harassment, that he's had many failed marriages/relationships &amp; many children by different women &amp; yet she allowed herself to be charmed by him &amp; diagnosed him w/ "depression" when he was going through "narcissist collapse" because he was between "love bombed sex targets"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh my, I do believe his "therapist" needs to follow me so that she becomes more educated about #NPD abuse: Seems there may be some "playing the victim &amp; blaming &amp; shaming the real victim" going on here. This "therapist" knows there was a million dollar lawsuit against him for<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Narcissists have no standards or boundaries, no concept of Right/Wrong, Good/Bad. Everything is just a chaotic mess of a free-for-all: Love-bombing, sex, twisting truths, center of attention, people-pleasing, partying, blowing everything up, blame the victim, move on, repeat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha! Me too! Dah, Wow, what a concept: "No, I will not allow this &amp; nope, I will not back down." And oh, the concept of "Right/Wrong, Good/Bad" is so cool. Weird thing though: narcissists don't have boundaries either: that's why we attract one another. We're both people-pleasers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraderJoesRants  Pleeze, oh pleeze, #TraderJoes , do not close early on the #FourthofJuly. Oh heaven: if you should close early then The #Predator will be released out on the streets to cultivate, groom &amp; seduce to get his "Holiday Love-Bomb Sex." No! Save us all. Help! #NPD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenKing @Cherdara America should not be glamorized. Everything we're told is a lie: At an all time high despite fake statistics: homelessness, hunger, unemployment, poverty, drug-overdoses, suicide, mental disorders, those without needed health care, pets killed in shelters, family court abuse ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamanthasLaw Same here. Those type of posts are so creepily manipulative. They make me cringe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope the #earthquake shook The Predator so much so that his soul woke up. Never mind. I just remembered, he actually turned his own children into his play-toys &amp; seduces, charms, flatters, grooms &amp; tries to get love-bomb sex from most anything that moves. No hope. #TraderJoes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>His Hell Cycle: flatter, charm, seduce, fantasy idealize, love-bomb, honeymoon period, grow bored, triangulate target against monkeys, create mayhem &amp; chaos, throw target under the bus, disappear as everything blows up, find new target, repeat the above-forever. #TraderJoes #NPD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh my, sounds like The Predator: He turns the #4thofjuly , a day that many died fighting for our freedom, into a huge party scene amongst his targets &amp; monkeys -  just to get love-bomb sex &amp; to be the center of attention. #TraderJoes #NPD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He got out of Vietnam with a college deferment; dropped out of college because he was having sex w/ women &amp; now he celebrates #July4th by making it a huge day of celebrating: Grooming new &amp; old sex target &amp; new &amp; old monkeys to party with him &amp; have sex. Yep.  #HappyFourthOfJuly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boo1951 North Oceanside here. It rolled &amp; even shifted the entire house. Scary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NarcAid haha ... Yep, seems to fit the "50+ Predatory Male Crowd, Sucking Down The Viagra and Taking Advantage of our Desperate Hook-Up Culture."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chelett14988071 @DerronEShort Didn't go too far. We took their "head of household" role and their jobs first (&amp; their other jobs were outsourced) ... we emasculated them first. They reacted by attaching themselves to the "quick and easy hookup" movement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He becomes a "woo woo spiritualist" that proclaims a weird &amp; twisted all encompassing "love" for the earth, universe, humanity but all he really wants to do is f*ck everything that moves: He aligns the concept of "higher &amp; more evolved love" into his need to f*ck everything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder if his so-called "therapist" knows that he tries to love-bomb me back every week &amp; I tell him off; &amp; that I'm the only one of many dozens of exes who has character &amp; refuse to be "back-up, ego-source" just to use &amp; abuse him for his freebies or love-bombing. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Report "therapists" who support &amp; enable abusive men - allow him to twist the truth, play the "victim," then call the real victim a liar, &amp; then blame, shame, and smear the real victim for advocating against NPD abuse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He told me that he has an angry ex; a cheating ex; a crazy ex; an ex that ran away after having their baby; a girlfriend that sent herself to therapy; an ex that was so crazy she committed suicide. Hmm, a lot of exes for 1 "innocent victim," let alone a lot of "crazy" exes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So-called "psychologist" allowing a serial sexual &amp; emotional predator to twist the truth, manipulate her, play the "victim" (repeatedly) &amp; now Victim Shaming, Blaming &amp; Smearing an Advocate who Educates Women on Abusive Men ...Not good. This "psychologist" needs to be reported.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Local "psychologist" is enabling predatory-psychopathic men, blaming the woman for reacting, advocating, spreading awareness, victim shaming &amp; blaming &amp; being a monkey to a known predator who's a serial emotional &amp; sexual predator. Not good. She even calls herself an "empath."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. This "psychologist" enabled him during 1 of his many divorces...he was the "victim" and she was a "cheater." She did find another man but only after he cheated on her with anyone with a pulse, triangulated her against all of his monkeys &amp; turned his children into play-toys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yours as well? Oh my. No, he claims that his psychologist supports him &amp; I'm the problem because I'm on here "blogging" (as they both call it). Ha.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes ... But they're very generous in the beginning. That's why we suffer from cognitive dissonance. Everything ends up being a twist from the initial love bombing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I find it really odd that a "psychologist" thinks it's normal that a 70-year old man has been married 5 times, has 6 children by 3 different women, cheated on every wife or woman for the next wife or woman &amp; that everyone of his "relationships" blew up. But it's never his fault.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, maybe The Predator's so-called "psychologist" should know this information ... and from a fellow colleague. And funny that his "psychologist" doesn't know that a normal, healthy man doesn't keep detailed lists of hundreds of women that he's trying to get sex from. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He told me that his "psychologist" supports him; he's the "victim." Odd that this "psychologist" doesn't know by now that he goes through a different woman every 1-2 yrs, all these "relationships" blow up &amp; that he only gets some exes back who sell their soul for his love bombing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He admitted to me with dead eyes &amp; an eerie smile that when he &amp; yet another now ex wife were court ordered to attend counseling, they interviewed 3 &amp; he convinced her to go with the one who liked him best. He then tried to get me to visit the same one with him. Nope. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's turned our Nation's Birthday into one of his several holidays of the year to seek "Love Bomb Sex &amp; To Be The Center of Attention Amongst The Monkeys" Day. What a way to honor our country. Help us all.   #TraderJoes #Predator @TraderJoesRants #4thofjuly2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DerronEShort Humanity has gone collectively insane. No morals, standards, values, dignity, code of conduct. Moral Relativism (anything goes; all opinions are right), the destruction of the family unit, &amp; men no longer has a role in society or the family (women took it away).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>His many other exes are crazy looking &amp; crazy acting but he doesn't consider them crazy because they went from being the ex sex target to a steadfast monkey. They still hover around for free handouts from the psychopath: they play part in his rotating ego-circus. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He eerily smirked as he told me that he thinks he drove two different women insane. One of these women ended up killing herself. I asked if he felt bad about this. He shot his dead eyes at me, "No, she was crazy." He's an evil source that love-bombs. #TraderJoes #Predator<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>His love-bombing is so grossly inappropriate: taking virtual strangers out to dinner &amp; fun-filled f*ck days is not normal. Has humanity gone insane? If someone tried to do this to me, say when I was in my 20s &amp; hanging out with better people, I'd be afraid. #TraderJoes  #Predator<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricaWe77927227 Women are partially to blame for this. We can blame "Friends with Benefits" and "No Strings Attached," porn, easy hookup sites &amp; all of us trying to sexualize our looks &amp; attitude. Also, we were too ready, willing &amp; available to have sex with them &amp; then take care of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never mind: there's some early 4th festivals going on tonight. Watch out for your sisters, aunts, daughters, mothers .... this guy targets anyone that moves. He has to make everyone pay attention to him &amp; he knows all the #4thofjuly2019 love-bomb tricks. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I sure do hope the #Predator is working tomorrow, on the 4th. Then, he'll only be love-bombing &amp; seducing the customers &amp; his co-workers. Help us all if he's off tomorrow. We do not want this guy killing people on the streets trying to chase down his 4th of July Love-Bombing Sex.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4th of July: Be careful out there. This is one of the Predator's biggest days to get love-bomb sex &amp; attention. He'll be running down people &amp; animals to get to his new sex-target source. Oh, she'll be "amazing" too. Haha. Watch out! #WednesdayWisdom #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're living in sick times: anything goes; a free-for-all; Moral Relativism - no right or wrong. This is why our society is falling apart: no controls; no limitations; afraid to say "No, I will not allow this;" no family structure; no expectations; no sense of responsibility.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They're detached from self; no internal foundation of being. They morph into whoever they're trying to impress, capture, control &amp; win-over. They're disconnected from Source. Everything they say and do is to present a certain image for the audience in front of them.  #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #Predator only cares about making a good impression with people; being "loved" &amp; admired. He flatters, flirts, seduces, charms &amp; is over-the-top nice &amp; giving. His game is to get people to "love" him. After the conquest is over, he throws everyone under the bus. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraderJoes He's attracted to vile losers, co-predators &amp; horrible using women. And he even enables his old children to be losers, mooches &amp; partiers. He attracts or creates what he is and what he feels comfortable with. #TraderJoes #Predator<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's a people-pleasing narcissist - separated from self: no character, values, judgement, code of conduct, discernment, sense of self-responsibility, internal motivation or focus. He manipulate &amp; seduces everyone to "like" him. And the worse the person is, the more of a challenge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#YouMayHaveFailedToMention that you're a sexual &amp; emotional predator, pervert, addicted to attention, have to be the center of attention - every second of your waking day, that you taught your now old kids to be mooches &amp; partiers, and that you're King Of Vile &amp; Disgusting People<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He manipulates, seduces &amp; gives extremely inappropriate gifts &amp; time to people. He manipulates everyone to fall in love with him. But after this, there's nothing real left; nothing of quality; a void. It was all his sick game: To prove to himself that he's loved. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely no responsibility &amp; it's a "generational family irresponsibility." He actually groomed his own children to be irresponsible mooches. He told me that his father enabled him to be irresponsible. Not one single person in his family is responsible &amp; autonomous. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He doesn't care if he's used &amp; abused by his monkeys. All that matters is that he's "the center of attention" in the world of lowlifes. He even molded his own children into lowlife monkeys so they'd always be around to party with him. Great parenting. #SundayThoughts  #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, "their neurobiology is damaged." We're giving them far too much credit for being systematic &amp; calculating in their destruction. No. They're insane basket-cases &amp; all they do is seek sex, attention, validation. They have no idea what the hell they're doing. #SundayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I'm a narcissist &amp; I just want to love-bomb &amp; have lust-filled sex; but in my sick mind I think this is love. And when life gets real &amp; you hold me accountable, I'll lie &amp; destroy just to get to the next sex &amp; attention source." #TraderJoes #Predator #CrappyExcusesForCheating<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. He love-bombs derelicts, losers, drug-addicts, alcoholics &amp; spiritual whack-jobs &amp; all have absolutely no sense of right/wrong, good/bad &amp; all know he's a predator, yet enable him just to get his freebies. So I tell him this is all wrong: He tells me to become more spiritual<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The self-proclaimed "spiritualist" predator gets away with it becuz there are plenty of whack-job, woo-woo, nutcase, dead-eye, "spiritual" women out there who don't have a sense of right/wrong, good/bad &amp; they feel sorry for &amp; think they can "heal" shitty men who bash their exes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohmygosh: How desperate, crazy &amp; lonely are people just to be inappropriately flattered &amp; love-bombed. He acts all pure &amp; innocent &amp; gets his younger co-workers talking about sex with him: butt positions, Ecstasy &amp; bondage. And then he takes them on all-expense paid fun days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator admitted to me that he waits for one of his targets to "calm down" &amp; then he returns to win her back. Every time I tried to hold him accountable, he would become violent, tear out of my house &amp; there'd be a crazy &amp; enabling ex waiting to be love-bombed.  #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonKUhlerLPC But that's what I originally said: Childhood trauma.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never before in the history of mankind have we all been "out there" and not only that, but out there non-stop. We used to stay home! The #Predator has his pick of hundreds of swarming "ants" needing food, love, attention &amp; a good time. And he knows just how to bait them in!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you then saying some come from normal childhoods &amp; it's biological/chemical/genetic? Perhaps some even come from "loving" homes that lacked boundaries, discipline &amp; a "tough love" approach?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pay attention to actions. He claims to be Spiritual, a Buddhist, Yogi, Composer, College Educated .. but all he does is party, play, f*ck and go from one person to the next person. There is absolutely nothing stable in his life. I know, it's my fault; I'm the Angry Ex. #TraerJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HaylieAWriter haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peaceblitz They're on a spectrum. Just like everyone &amp; everything. There's the CEO type and the unrefined type. They're just like us: some of us are organized, some of us aren't. Some of us have money, some of us don't. Some of us are unrefined, awkward &amp; shy &amp; some of us are extroverted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you should dare make a stand against right or wrong, good or bad you're gaslighted that you're a bad person or as you say, you're accused of being "closed minded." This is how narcissists thrive. A bunch of woo-woo whack jobs out there who close their eyes &amp; enable evil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonKUhlerLPC Most every single one has childhood trauma. Cold, neglectful mother; abusive father; seeing a pet suffering and dying: no one caring or consoling &amp; not permitted to grieve &amp; process; being around hunters; poverty, bad schools, being bullied; no adults showing empathy, compassion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peaceblitz They flirt with everyone. They're doing a "barometric reading" on their "worth" and how attractive they are. This is because they have nothing solid going for themselves, they're voids; no real achievement; no ability to focus on higher goals. #TraderJoes #Predator<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A lot of morally bankrupt people out there who are struggling &amp; who'll do anything for a free meal &amp; entertainment. No matter how gross they are, they know how to seduce, ingratiate, be a social chameleon, act like they're listening &amp; play the "poor victim boy, unlucky in love."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nesting88 @RamblingsRosie @christinem1059 hahaha. I was wondering .... The Trader Joe's where I live has a bunch of creepy crew-dudes (and some creepy and narcissistic women as well) who float around on the floor, amongst the customers, trying to get hook-ups. Not overtly of course; they play helpful &amp; innocent  ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am so tired of dead eye'd, vacant so-called "spiritualist" who espouse Moral Relativism &amp; they do nothing good for the world.  All they do is eat, f*ck, breed &amp; play.  But what's pure evil: they enable evil &amp; they refuse to protect those being harmed: "all is love." Pure evil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@loa_thesecret @IndyGoldy Actually, even better, "No, that's not right," or "No, I will not tolerate that," or "No, you're wrong." Moral Relativism and the Dead Eye, Woo Woo Spiritual Movement destroyed Humanity. No more Woo Woo. Just study, facts, growth, self-education, service work. No more nonsense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nesting88 @RamblingsRosie @christinem1059 Yes, big difference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nesting88 @RamblingsRosie @christinem1059 If I may ask, what state do you shop at a Trader Joe's?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RamblingsRosie @christinem1059  They don't have humor &amp; they don't understand sarcasm. The only "humor" they may have is when they're duping someone or witnessing a person being duped. The Predator's humor: to get a woman, who has a boyfriend, to look at his penis. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He parties w/ his old children &amp; encourages their vile, lowly mooching lifestyle. Every single one of his yearly rotating women has had a problem with this grossness &amp; yet according to him, they hate his children. And oh, now I hate his children. Boy, are his monkeys squeaking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And he fantasy-idealizes porn &amp; lowly raunchy women: The Pretty Woman Complex. In his sick brain, he thinks if he gets a nasty woman to have sex w/ him, his penis won The Battle of All Dirty D*cks. And that the dirty woman will be his princess &amp; she'll forever serve his penis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He views nasty people as something to conquer, subjugate &amp; subdue to his will, control, love-bombing &amp; inappropriate gestures. He thinks that if he ingratiates himself to nasty people that he's is a better, more loving person &amp; that he'll be somehow "protected;" that he's worthy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They all say similar. He'll be love-bombing, fantasy idealizing a crazy-a** woman in 3 days time. They're all love &amp; sex addicts. But of course it's not really "love" in the true sense: It's lust but they're too delusional &amp; desperate for attention to know the difference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. I hesitate speaking too strongly about this because most women are in a deep fog; a low consciousness &amp; still think they have to be in a relationship at all cost. We have to start evolving our thinking. Men, women, humanity is toxic; intimate relationships no longer work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peaceblitz @nesting88 @rewirethebrain_ Nah. Why even look? Let's fix our own lives. Let's work on building our future. Let the boys f*ck all over the place. Let them self-destruct.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Houses made of sand. What happened to women? Men used to have to be solid, strong &amp; morally &amp; financially stable to win us over. They provided for us; we took care of them. Now? We f*ck broke predatory losers who love-bomb us &amp; then we cry because he f*cks on the streets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nesting88 @peaceblitz @rewirethebrain_ Great for you. But most men don't want to introspect, retrospect, reflect, change, improve, grow. Men cannot be alone (they're even worse than women at this). Men connect through f*cking. Sad but true. If we're evolved women, we have to learn to evolve on our own path.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nasty, lowlife people are easier to control. They don't have morals, values, character, sense of right &amp; wrong or good &amp; bad; they're willing to be a narcissist's monkey to grab at the benefits; they rejoice in bullying the target of the narcissist just to feel part of the gang.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndyGoldy @peaceblitz @rewirethebrain_ @nesting88 Perhaps this means you should work on improving yourself and your own life; get to a super healthy mental, emotional, physical &amp; financial condition and then you'll recognize a healthy man when he comes along.:)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peaceblitz Childhood trauma? C-PTSD?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peaceblitz @rewirethebrain_ @nesting88 Nope. The only thing left to do, at this time in Humanity's disintegration, is to work and build your own health, your own home &amp; safety &amp; your own healthy mental state (study, learn, practice, create).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peaceblitz @nesting88 @rewirethebrain_ Yes, And it caused a disintegration of their mental faculties and what at one time was a healthier and clearer psychological condition. Now, their brain is so grossly mis-wired, that they actually seek out porn even more to relieve their state of mental sickness &amp; darkness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator is attracted to vile &amp; lowlife people. He believes that if he wins over a nasty person's approval, then he somehow won a battle within himself. He's attracted to nastiness because this human grossness is a reflection of his own sick soul; it's his comfort zone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nesting88 @rewirethebrain_ Definitely. Porn was the final straw in causing the complete breakdown of humanity's consciousness and evolution. We're now in a state of degeneration &amp; disintegration. Also: breakdown and destruction of the family unit; or the disintegration of male/female roles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MindTendencies2 @NomfundoEngler Not healthy. You got this from the "woo woo spiritual whackjobs" movement. Having boundaries, saying "No," being firm yet in control .. teaches horrible people to behave better, at least around you. The woo woo movement failed in a big way: it left out the concept of Tough Love.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These guys objectify their own daughters. The Predator hangs out &amp; parties with his own daughters. He actually taught them, trained them from babies, to party, mooch &amp; have sex. He didn't teach them an ounce of character development, morals, integrity, autonomy or strength.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rewirethebrain_ @nesting88 I've learned to work on myself: build and create my own life. Find things you're passionate about &amp; pursue &amp; develop them. People are crazy out there &amp; I believe that we should evolve out of seeking intimate relationships. Humanity is going through a sick crisis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #Predator collects people. Yes, he's a People Collector &amp; a forerunner in the People Collecting Industry. People Qualifiers: Must eat, f*ck, play &amp; be lowlife, nasty &amp; vile. Predator believes the nastier the person is, the more of a challenge they are in his People Collection<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricaWe77927227 So typical. I'm sorry. This is our time to look into ourselves, learn what a sh*tty man and sh*tty relationship is, and grow to be better and to expect more of ourselves and others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stop falling for the lowly flattery &amp; charm &amp; the inappropriate love-bombing. Pay attention to: Actions! How many exes? Quality, not quantity, of people around them. Daily habits &amp; patterns. Children: independent &amp; strong or partying mooches? #FridayThoughts #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nesting88 @peaceblitz @thegoodgodabove Oh my....some of those have to be fake. Help us all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haha. Yes, they know; that's where they find him. But he's a conman, a charmer; he showers lowlife, struggling, desperate, vile people with inappropriate food, favors, flattery, attention &amp; fun. It's uncanny. He targets lowlife people who've never been paid attention to before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He stands around @TraderJoes with a piece of torn off box taking inventory of what needs stocking. He chats it up w/ most anyone, tells them he's a composer (who's not into music?) &amp; then he writes down their contact info on the cardboard. Guess who finds all the cardboard?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricaWe77927227 Haha. It's okay to laugh. I'm trying to be humorous in my tweets. The predator is so sick that I'm trying to write about the absurdity of it all. If we weren't so traumatized by them, they're actually creepy insane clowns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He tells everyone he's a composer; he collects contact information &amp; seduces women by telling them he's a composer; and he wants to be a composer to get sex &amp; attention. Thing is, he's too busy seeking attention, seducing, love-bombing &amp; f*cking to actually compose. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are so busy putting labels on these crazies: narcissist, no psychopath, no sociopath, no npd, that we lose track of the fact that they're bat sh*t crazy. They're insane people who know how to expertly lie &amp; con, love-bomb &amp; f*ck. End of story. #TraderJoes #Predator<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peaceblitz But these guys don't see their harm. Most think they're the victim, misunderstood, not treated right by the woman. These guys that we're talking about here are brain damaged. They're biologically, chemically, genetically screwed up. All they do is want to f*ck. They're crazy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes! You are right: Female monkeys are abusive toward women. I can't tell you how many of his female monkeys told me that he was crazy, a predator, a psychopath &amp; yet, every time I tried to hold him accountable &amp; leave him, they came lurking back around to party with him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peaceblitz There are probably very few people out there, a very small minority, who set out to cause evil. I just think people are f*cked up in general &amp; have no clue, no consciousness, of what they're doing. People are messed up &amp; cause a lot of harm without ever thinking about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Spiritual "Predator" is the most dangerous entity in current day society: He appeals to women who are lost and who lack boundaries and a firm sense of "right &amp; wrong, good &amp; bad." Spiritualism does not enable evil. Spiritualism is loving boundaries and tough love. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Love-Bomber who claims to be spiritual is the most dangerous of all. He has no boundaries, no standards, no discipline, no character, no integrity, no control. To him "spiritual" means everyone is good and fuckable and there is no accountability or stops on evil. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@indianaboognish They have to say certain things to win favor. An authentic person, who doesn't lie and bs, would never survive. We live in a Culture of Deception.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nesting88 haha, great idea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They fantasy-idealize their targets &amp; monkeys. In their sick minds, they only "attract the best" because they think they are special; even though they have to love-bomb everyone. If you should ever poke a hole in their fantasy-tale about a monkey, they go ballistic. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricaWe77927227 He doesn't make a lot of money. But having sex with women is his one and only focus, so he makes the time because it's his priority.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha! They want to "tap" everything that moves. He doesn't make a lot of money but he uses credit like a maniac...extremely financially irresponsible. He then files for bankruptcy as often as the law allows (every 7 yrs?). Yes, he #lovebombs at first but then starts to mooch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He targets most everyone...within reason. He has to keep notes on who's who &amp; what woman is into what. He then comes up with seduction tricks that fits each target &amp; what she's interested in. He then does follow up notes on what worked, what didn't, what to try next. Seriously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nesting88 Yep. He got fired from his previous job for sexually harassing women; lied on his app to get his job at #TraderJoes &amp; immediately started seducing his co-workers &amp; the customers. I found pages of detailed notes of his different methods to trick different women into having sex.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nesting88 Yes, like the store.:)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, they sure are sexual deviants. But funny thing is they play like they're sexually innocent and pure. I suppose that's how they trick their targets and monkeys. They play pure, sweet, misunderstood, abused little boy that just wants a nice, wholesome relationship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why we need to hold not only them accountable but their monkeys. Expose them; write letters of complaint; do whatever you can within legal boundaries so that you stay squeaky clean. But you also need to practice standing strong in the face of the sh*t they're gonna throw.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He told me that "porn is real &amp; the women are really enjoying themselves." Haha. I explained, "No, it's all fake; they're covered with makeup; special lighting, effects &amp; filters and their orgasms are fake." He got mad. I broke through his delusion. #pornaddicts. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree. Been having this very same conversation with a few friends.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nesting88 That's where the sociopath hunted me down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I cringe at the low &amp; disgusting level I dropped to. He manipulated me into going camping with 2 horrible people that he was obsessed with: a lowlife co-predator &amp; his disgusting "girlfriend." He then coerced me into screaming louder fake orgasms than her fake loud orgasms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peaceblitz Exactly me. Someone said to me, "First trust in the small, then trust in the big." This has helped me so much in trying to improve the way that I behave around people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He claims to be a Composer but his daily habits contradict this. He spends all day long looking for people to party with: #MagicalThinking Wants all the sex &amp; attention that comes w/ being A Composer but is too busy seeking sex &amp; attention to actually Compose. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. We listen to their words and don't pay attention to their real life situation, their habits and patterns &amp; their past performance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricaWe77927227 Then you're not the typical woo woo, nonsense "spiritual" nutcase, whackjob Southern Californian. Yay ... then you're right on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nesting88 They flirt with most anyone. They have to be the center of attention at all times. Sick stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How he collects contact information for potential targets or monkeys: He has a few "ins" to people's lives: He claims to be Spiritual, a Composer, a Yogi &amp; into surfing. Who in this crazy town doesn't think they're spiritual or isn't into yoga, surfing, or music? #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They breed out of lust; no thinking going on. Then they turn their children into their monkeys, their entertainment, their brainwashed "party girls &amp; party boys." They don't love anyone. They raise their own children to be lowlifes so they can control them &amp; have "party friends."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PsychologyDoc okay ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Predator encourages his old children to party, hang out &amp; have fun, mooch off of people, sit in restaurants &amp; eat &amp; get the best of everything even though other people have to pay for it. He outright refuses to role model morals, character, delayed gratification, autonomy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PsychologyDoc Don't be a #NarcissisticPersonalityDisorder . Focus on higher and better things. Don't worry about your hair. Learn math, or science, or software development or do something really cool: #animalrescue . Your appearance matters very little in the big picture.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricaWe77927227 Even sicker yet: They find people, one after another, who feel sorry for them and bail them out. Somehow they never run out of people who come to their rescue. It's so crazy. I've really been looking at myself lately. Why on earth did I put up with a loser like this? Uhg.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everything we heard about her was a lie. Remember the "she speaks six languages" one. The preferred second language of any European or Asian is English &amp; she can barely speak that. #wednesdaythoughts #WednesdayWisdom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator told me that it's good that his old children have mooched their entire lives. He explained: "My father bailed me out until I was in my 50s." The Predator handicapped his own children so that he could not only control them, but party with them. #TraderJoes #Predator<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NSurvivor I don't believe this is "shaming other women." Personally, this has all been an awakening for me and it made me look into myself more to try &amp; understand why I wasn't smarter &amp; more in control of myself &amp; my choices; why I chose to be with bad men.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VerityVeritas1 Yes! They gravitate towards what's normal for them &amp; this is why their targets &amp; monkeys are lowlifes, co-predators &amp; just horrible people. They don't stand-out with descent people so they make themselves "King Amongst The Lowlifes." #TraderJoes  #WednesdayWisdom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VerityVeritas1 Yes! Exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh my, The #TraderJoes #Predator will "surely be" grooming seducing a lot of the customers &amp; his co-workers with that "there" product. He'll be the one behind the sample counter passing the ol' "seduction salsa" out for certain! Come Ye All, get your food &amp; sex from The Predator.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First Red Flag, I'm Gone. #ChangeYourPastIn5Words  #TraderJoes #Predator  https://t.co/p7E75Cgkqj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So true!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator's current &amp; former targets &amp; monkeys sell their soul to be love bombed by him. I can't tell you how many people warned me that he was crazy &amp; to get away; yet, these same people show up when he's throwing around free food &amp; free handyman service. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricaWe77927227 They're everywhere! What on earth is going on out there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricaWe77927227 haha,  no, I don't want to be sued. It was a gif that resembled him though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricaWe77927227 Oh my! I had this exact conversation just last night with a friend. We both came to the conclusion: What on earth is going on out there! Humans have gone insane!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator goes after crazy religious and even crazier spiritual nutcases. These women (and men) have no boundaries, have a weak moral compass, are often poor &amp; desperate (barely employed) &amp; are willing to put on the fake smiley face to get free food &amp; party time. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator trashes or loses everything he owns. He trashed his own house. He trashed all the gifts I bought him. His car is filthy. He doesn't care about anything but prowling for sex, attention &amp; validation. He spends every waking minute trying to be the center of attention.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it's time to start holding the monkeys accountable. They're just as nasty and evil as the narcissist. It's called harassment. #TraderJoes #Predator<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yourrealityfilm @BPsychologies Or, you can go after and hold accountable the monkeys he pitted against you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"You feel miserable and trapped don't you?" Oh, I'm sorry that's a loaded question ... but the hashtag didn't say I couldn't ask a loaded question. #AwkwardQuestionsToAskCouples  https://t.co/SL38ruaiBD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a freaky realization it was when I realized every single glamorized thing The Predator told me about his ex sex targets, current sex targets &amp; his monkeys was either a lie or an exaggeration. The only person who would ever become a monkey to anyone, is a horrible person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BernieSanders I would feel "free" again; not trapped and imprisoned in debt for the rest of my life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator ingratiates himself to the nastiest of all people. He thinks if he gets "in good" with the nasties, somehow he'll be "okay." Narcissists have zero self-esteem. And it's sort of funny to see the nasty monkeys scream &amp; drool when his love bombing stops. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshCoutu @lava_like haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unbelievable. The minute I call him out on a lie or one of his sick lifestyle tricks, he's immediately on his creepy phone hunting down an old sex target, or a possible new one, or a creepy monkey. Literally: He can't spend one second alone. Sick! #MondayMorning #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All sociopaths have their special grooming tricks to cultivate their monkeys. But the #TraderJoes Predator is the best in the whole wide world: He inappropriately feeds &amp; flatters low lifes &amp; he takes control over funerals &amp; memorials for people he barely knows. #SundayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow, just wow. A psychopath couldn't find a better job if he tried: a sex &amp; attention addict standing, all day long, in the middle of a bunch of lonely &amp; desperately aging ladies who are either losing their home or have no home. He's the Predator of #TraderJoes. #SundayThoughts  https://t.co/Db4IiX5yfZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#WorstThingToDoAfterSex Rely on the #narcissist after sex for anything good or productive to ever happen in your life again.   And plus, the sex with the narcissist wasn't that good anyway. You just thought it was good because you're desperate to be loved &amp; lonely. #TraderJoes  https://t.co/r0zfY2tTZK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPythia Haha. Good one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be careful of the lovebomber. #AdultingIn5WordsOrLess @TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm done with creepy men. #AdultingIn5WordsOrLess<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Geesh, really: #NationalSelfieDay  Do you mean National Narcissist Sociopath day?  I didn't even think people took selfies anymore? How last decade.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holds true for all sexual predators: their whole life is a lie: they don't even know what the truth, or reality is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MyPetPeeves Women or men who can't be alone &amp; have to go from one disastrous relationship into the next: never accomplishing anything; never learning &amp; growing on their own; never pushing themselves to evolve higher than their love and/or sex addiction. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They're not discerning &amp; are just looking for a free or cheap place to crash and to get all the benefits of a house cleaner, someone to do their laundry, a personal chef &amp; raunchy sex without questions. Honestly: Don't be flattered. It could be anyone. #FridayFeeling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricaWe77927227 @Smactra91 Typical. The real issue is, however, why on earth did we fall for them? What were we thinking? I know: It was the love bombing. Uhg. Women have to start understanding that love bombing is not normal and we shouldn't be flattered by it. #FridayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Narcissist Sociopath is a loser. The only reason we think they're something is because they lie about their accomplishments, or twist the truth, and they love bomb, people please, ingratiate, flatter, and charm. #FridayThoughts #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #TraderJoes Predator does whatever it takes to be seen as kind .... I mean he has to be seen as kind by everyone! Then, while he's acting innocent, naive &amp; kind, he's seducing, flattering &amp; charming for sex.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Honestly women: You really feel special? He needs somewhere to hang out, eat and have sex.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AfterTheNarc Don't be flattered. Get your ego out of the way. He "into" anyone who'll pay attention to him and give him sex. You're not special. And, oh, most everyone "puts out" now days so that really makes you *not* special.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Psychopaths never learn from mistakes: Got fired from his last job for sexually harassing women; a multi-million dollar law suit settlement against the company, so what does he do next? Lie on his app to get the store job &amp; immediately start trying to have sex with his coworkers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good men don't have a new "partner" every one or two years and then act like "poor little innocent boy" while calling yet another ex "angry, bitter, or crazy."  #TraderJoes  #Sociopath #ThursdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Smactra91 Vets financially exploit the love we have for our animals. Seek out alternative healing methods (diet; food; supplements) &amp; ask people on the internet for healing ideas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Smactra91 Financial Abuse is a huge problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How 'bout being a focused, driven, service worker filled with virtue &amp; character instead of trying to charm, flatter &amp; f**k every woman, within a far damn range, that you come across? #TraderJoes #predator #DickPicAlternatives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's addicted to attention, validation, being known as the "good, fun, giving, generous, laid back" guy. He flatters, charms, grooms &amp; ingratiates everyone ... even his own children. Don't be flattered; this is your ego leading you astray. #ThursdayThoughts #LetMeStartBySaying  https://t.co/YOr1iU61P2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SashitaFierce @1fragmentedmind True, true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stop allowing sociopaths, predators &amp; big, powerful businesses &amp; corporations to call you a liar and prevent you from revealing the truth. It seems as if @TraderJoes missed the whole meaning of the #metoo movement. Discrediting a victim is not allowed.  #liesyourparentstoldyou<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1fragmentedmind @SashitaFierce Yes, we are. Men are all dirty, creepy predators and women are all crazy trying to work, afford housing, &amp; take care of the children while the men are off being dirty, creepy predators. We need to stop breeding. There is no need for it anymore. We're overpopulated &amp; stressed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Great. And thank you also for being the role model for all guys in this god forsaken country to be dirty, creepy, low-life predators.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My parents told me that I had to be in a relationship, get married, have babies. Nope. This is brainwashing.

<|startoftext|>@SdChristelle @DelTaco Yes, yes, yes. Me too. Best thing that's ever happened to fast food. Thank you, @DelTaco and @SdChristelle for tweeting this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because all they care about is fun, f*cks &amp; food, they assume everyone else is the same.   And this is why they're only good at love bombing; as soon as reality hits, they find someone else to love bomb.    #TraderJoes  #wednesdaythoughts  #narcissisticabuse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How does the narcissist sociopath get away with it? They twist the truth or rarely outright lie, love bomb, flatter, charm, target lowly people, surround themselves with their groomed &amp; vile monkeys &amp; are experts at presenting a superficial image. #WednesdayWisdom #traderjoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just can't be nice to a psychopath. The more you give him, the more he'll want, take &amp; expect. Not only that, he'll find a nasty, mean woman more of a challenge. What an idiot: Nasty, mean women aren't more of a challenge; they're just plain ol' nasty &amp; mean. #ICantBeTheOnlyOne<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #TraderJoes Predator actually goes to work to find women to f*ck him &amp; he actually works to get a paycheck so he can #lovebomb and groom people to play with him or f*ck him. Who does this? #ICantBeTheOnlyOne<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who in the right mind goes to work to f*ck their coworkers? He ordered a cd: How To F*ck Your Coworkers. But it gets better: he ordered it after he got fired from his last job for f*cking his coworkers &amp; after he lied on his #traderjoes app so they'd hire him. #ICantBeTheOnlyOne<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The sick predator is tearing down my character at #TraderJoes because I have tons of detailed notes, in his handwriting, that he keeps of the customers &amp; coworkers he's trying to groom into having sex with him. I even have a cd addressed to him: How To F*ck Your Coworkers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm the "angry ex" once again, at #TraderJoes.  Funny how I was the "angry ex" a few years ago and I'm the "angry ex" again. Funnier still: he has a lot of "angry, bipolar, and crazy" exes. His brain dead monkeys just want to be fed, f*cked &amp; lovebombed. #ICantBeTheOnlyOne<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They actually love bomb and date their own children. #narcissisticabuse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#WhenICantBeBothered They don't have female "friends." This is an outright lie. These females are backup targets, sex sources, possible sex sources, attention sources, users and abusers (sociopaths are easily abused; they have to be "liked"), and flying monkeys. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#FridayFeeling Okay women: Normal men don't love bomb. Normal men don't pretend they're innocent little abused boys and seek out sexual position and orgasm advice from their female co workers. Oh, normal men don't treat their co workers to constant free food &amp; gifts. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is taught instead: entitlement, co-dependency, instant gratification and partying. Members of these families help bully each other's exes and provide excuses and fake alibis for each other. These people escape responsibility because they act like gang members. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#FridayFeeling Narcissists &amp; sociopaths come in families. It's an ugly, low level hedonistic lifestyle that's been passed down through the generations: families that don't teach character, integrity, morals, delayed gratification, focus &amp; independence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And all the people who were smart enough to stand up for themselves and get the hell away are "angry" or "crazy" or gotta love this one, "a crazy, angry ex."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#FridayFeeling Don't be flattered if he's love bombing you &amp; way into you way too quickly. He doesn't even know you. This is a sign that you should run away: He's not your Prince Charming; He's a crazy person who knows how to flatter &amp; seduce to get sex &amp; attention. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ever notice that all his monkeys who enable him &amp; do his bidding &amp; abuse by proxy are supposedly "amazing, delightful, great friends, highly educated, have great jobs &amp; lots of money," yet these same monkeys are low-life, drugged out, drunk, users, abusers &amp; losers?ü§î #traderjoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tried to explain to him that his "children" are old now &amp; he shouldn't be supporting their bad, irresponsible, partying lifestyle &amp; all their excuses for not be independent by now. He replied, "Well, my father did this for me until I was in my 50s." Yep, explains everything ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The predator actually molded his children, now old, into being drunk, drugged-out, irresponsible, narcissistic, entitled, mooching partiers so that he would always have them around to give him attention, hang out with him &amp; party with him. #traderjoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wvjoe911 @politicususa Nope. @FLOTUS  is a terrible role model for women everywhere. She's grotesquely disfigured &amp; plastic looking and not to mention, she enables a sociopath just so that she can live a gross &amp; piggish lifestyle. Sorry real pigs, you're way cooler.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whatever the gross lifestyle needs &amp; addiction of the sociopath is, he'll use those same things to get monkeys. Everything for the predator revolves around sex, food, fun &amp; attention. All his monkeys are people who can be manipulated with sex, food, fun &amp; attention. #traderjoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In a nutshell, real men were maimed &amp; traumatized for life so the #TraderJoes Predator could stay behind &amp; have sex &amp; be a breeder w/ multiple women &amp; create yet another generation of entitled narcissists. Now? He teaches his aging, adult children how to escape responsibility.  https://t.co/YPGo2A4sbL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>His family got him out of the Vietnam War on a college deferment but he dropped out of college because he was too busy obsessing over getting sex &amp; attention &amp; now he acts like he graduated from college &amp; the veterans who didn't have toxic enabling parents died for our country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's an expert liar, plays the victim &amp; wears the "peace loving, spiritual, guru, calm &amp; loving yogi" to perfection. He manipulates most everyone around him by being inappropriately generous &amp; giving. He targets struggling people who are desperate to grab at his "offerings."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They only seem smart because they surround themselves with low life, brainless, drug addicted &amp; alcoholic vile losers. Every now &amp; then they run across a smart person by accident &amp; that's the person who'll expose them. But, of course, we're the "crazy &amp; angry exes." #traderjoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder what lies he tells his monkeys when I'm "the love of his life" 1 second, &amp; 10 minutes later &amp; after I stand up for myself, he's trying to love bomb a new target. Oh, never mind, I know: His monkeys don't think, nor care, and plus I'm "crazy" anyway. #predator #traderjoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nesting88 Sometimes it's your only choice. You can't allow yourself to be abused - even by your own kids. You have to walk away &amp; hopefully the kids will come around in time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2019carolyn @TracyCampanell They're always desperate. They'll take anyone who'll give them attention ... within reason. They don't have discernment, qualifications or boundaries. This is why empaths and sociopaths attract each other: both lack boundaries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're their projection screen. They're a void. They'll run to anyone who'll throw them a crumb of attention, adoration, or admiration; even if it's fake adoration &amp; admiration; #narcissists are easily abused &amp; exploited.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Predator purposely molded his now old, adult children into being toxic, co-dependent, mooching, partying drug addicts &amp; alcoholics so they'd be under his control &amp; always be his playmates. He explained this: "Well, my father took care of me until I was in my 50s." Yep #traderjoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator surrounds himself with vile people who'll attack one of his sex targets if she dare stand up for herself or try to stop his control &amp; mental abuse &amp; cruelties. Good &amp; normal people don't attack people; let alone someone who's never done anything to them. #traderjoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes I think animals have a higher and purer state of consciousness than most of humanity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Humanity is so damn primitive. Really? We're still into horse racing and Boy Scouts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #traderjoes Predator ingratiates himself to everyone...everyone. He has to make everyone "like" him at whatever price &amp; trick it takes. He hones in on what people are into &amp; then he offers them that very same gift. He's constantly building his monkey circle of creepy people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The predator stands around Trader Joe's with torn off pieces of cardboard from the food boxes, jotting down what food needs re-filling, while simultaneously getting contact information from any woman that's desperate enough to be picked up at Trader Joe's. #hookup #traderjoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nopenopenope_88 haha...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rewirethebrain_ We can all hope that he dies during surgery; then you won't have to worry about no contact. Just saying...:)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aliveandlouder Because these guys destroy our mental health: All the gaslighting, mind games, tricks, deception, lies. A normal brain can't handle the war zone. You'll be okay, it just takes time. A lot of healing needed: healthy foods, exercise, quality books &amp; movies, quiet time, rebuilding<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's so not normal for an aging man whose had hundreds of screw partners to act innocent &amp; shy around his co-workers &amp; ask these same co-workers questions about sexual positions &amp; what Ecstacy feels like because he's just curious &amp; because he's lived a sheltered life. #traderjoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It took me years of self-work to see the real me. I was shocked to realize, I wasn't the "poor, little innocent, empath, too good &amp; beautiful" who was targeted by the Trader Joe's Predator, I was crazy myself. Normal people don't allow themselves to be seduced &amp; love-bombed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uhm, hmm, it's not really normal for an aging, old guy to act like a 12-year-old and want to hang out and party with his co-workers who are more than half his age. Just saying... And oh, you're not special: he flatters &amp; seduces most anyone ... within reason. #TraderJoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you speak up he'll slander &amp; smear you to his monkeys that you're crazy &amp; he'll pit his monkeys against you. If you speak up, he'll gaslight you with "I don't want drama" even though he's the one creating the drama. If you speak up, he'll walk away &amp; find someone else to f*ck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DerronEShort Marriage is no longer something to be celebrated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not normal for an aging, old man to groom his young co-workers into having all-expense paid "fun days" with him.   And oh, it's not normal that he has to charm everyone into "liking" him.   #psychopath #sociopath #narcissist #predator #traderjoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're gluttons who no longer use our brains for critical thinking. The packaging at #traderjoes is hazardous to animals &amp; the environment. And why does Trader Joe's not verify info on job applications, allow #nepotism &amp; have a creepy legal team that squashes potential law suits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't feel flattered. Get your ego out of the way. They'll use anyone that's available and within range of their personal "attractive" standards. They return to us to do "Ego Check-Ins:" to see if we're still into them. This sick interplay is a combination of messed up egos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Narcissist just wants the fun &amp; lust of a "relationship;" nothing past being a 12-year-old playing on his delusional playground of sex, fun, eating, spending money he doesn't have, being the center of attention &amp; the "great, fun, cool, guy" to a bunch of losers. #traderjoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #TraderJoes Predator pays, feeds &amp; does inappropriate favors for lowlife people to be his monkeys. I fell into this too. My ego tells me that I'm better than his typical gross, nearly homeless, drug-addicted monkeys. Then I realized: when I fell into this...I was lowly also.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenKamalaHarris A typical #sociopath and #narcissist politician. They have to respond to everything even though it doesn't make sense and they spin everything and everyone round and round in a circle. Why not just say, "You make a good point" with dignity, grace, and courage?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They are surrounded by chaos but sit calmly, with a smile, feeding, flattering, and trying to f*ck everyone.  They are the poor, little, innocent boys, unlucky in love; and those who dare speak out against them, are the "crazy exes."  #traderjoes #metootraderjoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love bombing, inappropriate and grand gestures, superficial charm and flattery, and the "I'm a poor victim boy, unlucky in love - she's bad," are not normal. And, oh, #traderjoescaptains, neither is an employee buying you lunch and working off the clock to look like "good boy."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@traderjoes Uhm, perhaps #traderjoes shouldn't allow their employees to stand around seducing their co-workers and customers. Just saying. I know your legal team squashes all potential lawsuits, but still ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KellyTownsend11 @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump The real issue is we can't take care of another country when many in our own country are suffering with homelessness, poverty, priced out of their homes, unemployment, under-employment, lack of descent medical care at an affordable price, horrible schools, depression &amp; suicide...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We listen to the words they use to love bomb &amp; groom us with &amp; we shut ourselves off to their other more revealing words. Plus, we don't pay attention to all the past &amp; current carnage in their lives; we excuse it away. Real issue: we don't take relationships slowly anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's grooming you. So you think you're special because he prepares you lunch in the break-room and acts sweet &amp; innocent. Funny thing, I've been working for a long time &amp; no man has ever joyfully bounced into the break room to throw free food at me. Don't get used to red flags.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricaWe77927227 We're in North County, San Diego.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricaWe77927227 Hmmm...Yep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricaWe77927227 What area is your guy from?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricaWe77927227 I was joking ... hahaha.. But then again! He's been through hundreds of women in the San Diego and Orange County area and still claims to be a "poor innocent boy, unlucky in love; she's an angry ex." So perhaps my joking was intuition!üòÄ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think we know the same guy. I'm also in San Diego. I'm quite certain he love-bombed &amp; mirrored you, too; and oh, got you to do crazy sex stuff because you were "special" &amp; he had so few experiences. And then when you called him out on something, he came back to love-bomb me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, I finally worked myself through the trauma of learning the predator tries to screw everyone in town, while love-bombing me, screwing me &amp; making me feel like I'm the most specialist ever...&amp; now just when I'm about ok, he comes back around to gaslight me that I was mistaken.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He uses the store to hunt for women; any woman; he has no qualifiers. Only requirement is that you fawn over him, tell him how cool he is, mention his hair, and let him set the rules of the relationship: We have a "relationship:" I get to do what I want to when I want to do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sorry but I'm distracted by the "Trump Woman" in the really awful yellow dress. Really? All that money .... all that power ... a life of entitlement ... and that's the dress you choose?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've had both family court lawyers and judges tell me: "The best liar wins and the one with the most money wins." Funny how people say America is the greatest nation in the world. No we're not.  #familycourt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just bad ... bad people everywhere. Humans need to stop reproducing. Anti-natalism has a point. Humans are destroyers. #antinatalism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator doesn't care about people or even his job. He only cares about making people 'like' him &amp; appearing as if he's doing a good job. He tricks everyone: He's the greatest love-bomber you'll ever know. Love-bombing is a red-flag. Wake up.  #traderjoes #predator<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DomesticAbuseis I caught him in a trail of lies, called him out on it as calmly as could ... He tore out of my house &amp; was calling back-up supply as he was driving out of my driveway, literally. Me: 2 years and I love being free &amp; away from crazy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@treasonstickers Fake Good Economy. Truth: People fell off the rolls; claimed "Self-Employed" to save face but make no money, have no benefits; people are now taking 2-3 part-time jobs with low pay, no benefits, no dignity. We can't afford housing &amp; use the emergency room for our medical care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnnyBlkshrt Please tell me that's photo-shopped?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator is sad that his very own National Feeding, F*cking, Flattering Holiday is over. He had to love-bomb every flying monkey in town yesterday.   So now, today, he wants to love-bomb me. On Feb. 15th. I'm special. I'm Feb. 15th Chosen.  #traderjoes #predator #narcissist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPythia Yeah. Older people look better with some weight on them. It plumps out their face, their wrinkles, their neck, or basically they don't look as haggard, scraggly, worn out. Lesser of the evils? More weight &amp; plumpy look but possible health issues &amp; fat in ugly, bad spots too!ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPythia Oh my ... they're all the same. But funny how they keep getting the women. It's their love-bombing and seducing. Women have to learn to never ever fall for the quick, fiery romance. This is what gets us in trouble. Men know how to play us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPythia Exactly! We were hood-winked by the love-bombing. My friends look at The Predator and think I'm crazy: he's not that attractive; he has a job at a grocery store; he drives a crappy car; is in debt; and has no education (tho he lies that he does). We were conned by the attention.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes! Leads to our own brain-dysfunction. And we repeat ourselves over &amp; over again in dozens of different ways. And we change the examples: "You just threw me under the bus again, that waitress was mean &amp; abusive, you shouldn't have sided with the waitress .. What if I did ......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPythia "Ignoring" them takes force &amp; practice. Most of us have the impulse to scream at them until they "wake up" or ruin their lives so completely that they can never f*ck another person (literally and figuratively). These people are destroying humanity &amp; they're gaining in strength.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nopenopenope_88 Thank you. I'm leaning. Going to spend time reading this.üåª<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of his back-up supply sources must have had enough of him. He's back making his rounds again. I'm going to spend Valentine's loving on my dog and giving myself a home-made beauty treatment. No mind-f*ck in that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator disappeared many days ago; no word, nothing. I'm used to it so got busy trying to improve my own life. Got into a cool, healing flow. I never once reached out to him. He shows up today, out of the blue, and made Valentine's Day plans for us. Ah no, that's ok, really<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nopenopenope_88 What's neurodivergent? Sounds like me. Just assumed I was depressed w/ PTSD? All tests show nothing physical. Don't have a diagnosis of depression but just assumed I might be. Good days, bad days. I was wondering if mine was a "mind" thing. And the cold weather making it worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator turns everyone into his prostitutes. Everyone's showing up to be flattered, ingratiated, manipulated &amp; outright bought to like him; even his own adult-children. Toxic enablers everywhere. #traderjoes #flyingmonkeys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He lied on his application to get the job here." The crew-dude responded, "That's okay, I don't care, he's a really fun guy &amp; I like him working here." Yep, we're really evolving @traderjoes.  #IWillNeverLetGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was sorta bad today. Went into #traderjoes &amp; one of the predator's crew-dudes started telling me fantastical stories about The Predator's previous life before he came on board at the store.   I nicely said "That's not true, he was charged w/ sexual harassment &amp; lost those jobs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nomadirish2 And thank you.&lt;3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvelynSaves They also act "nice" when they're trying to get sex from you again or some other of of their care-taking needs met: food, entertainment, money, a place to crash, a favor done, attention, validation, or just a distraction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #predator wants all the fun, food &amp; f*cking that comes with a "relationship" but he refuses to be loyal, responsible, trustworthy, or a protector. Always throwing people under the bus to go from one f*ck "relationship" to the next. He's a trashy psychopathic #hedonist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And walked away. Rare for me. I am at my wit's end with #toxicsociety. Clerk picked up the part &amp; chucked it at me. She missed me. It fell to the ground behind me. I kept walking. Predator picked up the part, paid for it &amp; paid extra for the guarantee. #peoplepleaser #triangulate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator &amp; I were at a junk yard the other day. The people who worked there were terrible &amp; mean. Trying all my patience. I finally found the part &amp; went to pay for it. I was told it would be $9. Instead, mean clerk said it would be $13. I was fed up, threw the part down...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPythia So smart of you. So much worse and lasting trauma when you become intimate with them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPythia  Love your page. Such great issues exposed: Homeless veterans; how we treat our veterans; the truth about joining the military and why so many poor, uneducated men have no choice but to enlist and ultimately be brutalized &amp; end up with lasting trauma. #toxicsystem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lambsandiego @AmyBCaron  https://t.co/w4t9e8SiOO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPythia They keep ego-supply in their back-pocket to do an ego-check when they're bored, or in a fight with their previous woman. They're looking for sex, attention, fawning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TracyCampanell @AmyBCaron @DPythia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator sexualizes his adult children. He hangs out with them &amp; for all intents &amp; purposes it looks like they're all having sex together. I just can't figure out why these adult children don't have their own adult things to do &amp; why they want to hang out w/ their creepy dad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator is like an 8 yr old. Nothing but Food, Fun, F*cks. Ok, 8 yr olds don't do the latter but when he spent the night w/ me he said it reminded him of 2nd grade when his mother allowed his little girl classmate to spend the night &amp; they made believe they were camping.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peaceblitz Oh yes, "Life is short." But many women continue to waste their lives away because they think that middle or older-age will never happen to them. Time is going by quicker each year. And then we get sick &amp; realize we wasted our youth, health &amp; energy away on a horrible person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBearJieux High blood pressure. Seriously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our Family Courts destroy lives; they don't rebuild lives. They need to be dismantled. No more sociopathic judges &amp; attorneys that financially destroy families &amp; the future of children's lives. Only trained mediators trained to spot covert abuse should be allowed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And since so many of us are lonely, depressed, or shattered we fall right in line with the flattery. He then invites us out to dinner. What woman doesn't need a dinner out? His tricks: Flattery, Praise, Free Food. He hooks the woman, makes her feel special &amp; gets sex every time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #traderjoes Predator roams the floor of the store talking-up the older, desperate, divorcing, lonely women. He flatters, praises &amp; charms. Since he's obsessed with hair, his hair, everyone's hair, he'll remark how shiny, or long, our hair is &amp; ask us about the products we use<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What would happen if you simply didn't respond? That's what my sociopath did during divorcing. He simply flat-out denied, "This didn't happen," or he didn't even address my facts, proof &amp; pictures. He got away with it. And in real life, he doesn't respond &amp; disappears for awhile<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nopenopenope_88 Thank you for your support. Great talking with you. You did a fantastic job with your creep. Keep up the good work. I'm heading off line now. Hope to see you soon.:)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nopenopenope_88 You're human &amp; you were being appropriately nice. That doesn't mean he had a right to come on to you so quickly. It's part of the gaslighting: The Predator told me that I'm too friendly &amp; open &amp; give men the wrong impression.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nopenopenope_88 That's the gaslighting. It's unbelievable how effectively these creeps know how to gaslight us into feeling bad about ourselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nopenopenope_88 You did a great job heading the jackass predator off. I fell for it. You should be proud of yourself, seriously, that you caught on. Most women don't. Most women just want to be flattered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nopenopenope_88 When The Predator's seduction trick doesn't go as planned, he writes something like, "not over old boyfriend yet," or "stressed out over cat at home." Hehe, I'll have to tweet this info out separately.:)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nopenopenope_88 What a creep. Yes. Narcissist-Sociopath 101: Every woman within range, with the slightest possibility of their seducing and getting sex from, is deemed a "friend."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nopenopenope_88 Haha, you had me worried for a minute. I've told others about the lists, men &amp; women, &amp; everyone says the same: They've never heard of such a crazy thing: Keeping lists of hundreds of women that he's trying to seduce-just so he won't forget them &amp; how he's trying to seduce them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will never happen. Most, if not all, men need the attention to soothe and satisfy their 12-year-old lost and f*cked up ego.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nopenopenope_88 Your mention of "friend" in quotes creeped me out. He refers to these women, hundreds of them, as "friends."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nopenopenope_88 I know some of these women. Tried to warn some but they didn't want to hear it. You don't mean you're on these "particular" lists do you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nopenopenope_88 I have the real lists. I'm hiding them from him. The pics were sent from a phone I no longer have. Good idea. I think I need to take the pictures again &amp; upload them to google drive .. just in case. Thank you.:)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I call them the Predator Lists.   Now, when I refer to the Predator Lists, to scare him into seeing a psychologist, he replies with confidence: You don't have any lists.   Me: Yes I do. I sent the pics.   Him: Show me the lists .. you don't have them.   Sick, Delusional, Gaslight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator keeps records of women he's trying to seduce. Name, distinguishing feature, contact info, seduction trick he's trying. I found these. Hundreds of women. I took pictures so he couldn't grab them from me &amp; sent him the pics. I'm using this against him, to scare him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator is obsessed w/ his hair. That's how he gets women to bond with him.  He asks hair questions: about products &amp; styling tricks.  What woman wouldn't love this?  He once told me that he felt sorry for bald guys.  I feel sorry for old narcs w/ weird &amp; creepy long hair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Lie. Economy isn't doing great. Wages are at an all time low, no benefits, housing cost making people homeless. Unemployment isn't at an all time low. People fell off the roles, claimed "Self Employed" to save face &amp; are working at McDonalds &amp; Starbucks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator gets away with everything: cheating, lying, stealing, triangulating, smearing, destruction. How? Simple - The 3 tools he uses to manipulate most everyone: Flattery, Praise &amp; Free Food. Using these 3 tools he has a strong network of flying monkeys &amp; sex targets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The TJ Predator is a people-pleasing narcissist-sociopath. He feeds, flatters &amp; praises to get people to like him. His flying monkeys become addicted to the food, attention &amp; praising. The monkeys then help the predator abuse any ex or current target that dares speak out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator gets away with everything because he either doesn't respond, or if he's forced to respond, he simply denies: "I didn't do it" or maybe he'll make mention of an "angry ex." Me, I'm actually innocent of wrong doing, and I go on and on explaining how innocent I am.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BethLynch2020 This is America, The U.S.A., "The greatest nation in the world." Yep. Hmm, makes me wonder if anyone who's ever said that has been to, I don't know, Finland, Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Bulgaria, Bolivia, Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Switzerland, or I don't know, even Italy...France<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We start to think he has ADHD or Autism.   Or, that he's just shutting us down because we jabber on too much - because we repeat ourselves. But our "repeating" is due to his #Gaslighting  us &amp; acting as if he "doesn't get it."    We excuse it away or blame ourselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do we freak out &amp; scream at the sociopath? Why can't we move on? Simple. We've come in touch w/ a Black Hole of Evil. No words: psychopath, narcissist, predator, sociopath explains an Evil force that love-bombed us, exploited us, just to temporarily fill his Black Hole.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You'd think one would wonder why the predator has so many "angry exes?" Normal people w/ any sort of brains would ask, "Well, what are you doing to make them so angry?" Not so with his dumb, non-thinking circus side-show of eating astral clowns who show up for his free food &amp; fun<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kateseptember5 I knew that. That's why I wrote a funny text regarding their inability to understand sarcasm. And that's why I use sarcasm on him to begin with. They're clueless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're all being driven crazy by  ~Social media - mostly @facebook, smart phones ~Dating &amp; porn sites, instant hookups, instant marriage &amp; divorce   ~Bad jobs, bad economy, high cost of living, having children, losing our homes ~Predatory system ~Seeing human &amp; animal suffering<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraderJoesRants I'd like to do a Rant, if ok? You have a very charming predator, who kisses up to mgmt, working in 1 of ur stores who uses TJ to stalk women. I tried to come forth with the predator lists I found in his possession, but he headed me off w/ lies to ur captains 1st.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kateseptember5 So true!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Call 956-686-1141: speak out about killing animals. This shelter must NEVER release an unaltered animal to the public. Most people will NEVER return at a LATER time to alter. Vets have to start volunteering to spay/neuter animals in poor neighborhoods; Spay-Neuter Mobile Units.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SlowBoiledFrog Not always true. Sometimes the real victim of a toxic and harmful relationship is left in trauma and can stay stuck in depression, anxiety, fear, and PTSD for years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@traderjoesinsid Yep, yer employees sure be entertaining. So entertaining in fact that they prey after old, desperate, divorcing, and hungry customers. Trader Joe's = Real Life #tinder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@traderjoesinsid Not a good quote. Sometimes we need to take things personally as a form of introspection to see the damage we may be causing people so we can improve, grow, evolve. Ya know, instead of ignoring, heading off &amp; smearing paying customers who are preyed upon by your crew. #traderjoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe it's just me but now every time I see an oldish guy with long hair, like a woman's, and especially pulled back in a ponytail, and looking Guru-ish, I think predator. We all make our own special &amp; unique associations &amp; sometimes they're pretty accurate. #ThursdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HeSays2me Narcs don't pick up on social cues like the rest of us do. You can say they act almost autistic but big difference being, those with autism aren't manipulators, predators and habitual liars. And narcs don't sense that they're maybe not impressing someone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@suzystays @BlueTsuni üòÜ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@suzystays @BlueTsuni You're insulting the truly beautiful creatures of this planet. The Trump Family grossness has nothing to do with beauty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's negative association but I can't help myself: Now, every time I see a grown ass man, say over 24 yrs old, wearing a wet suit with bulge showing &amp; surfboard in hand, and who hangs out on the beach all day, I think narcissist. The mind is a weird thing. #ThursdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Severe gaslighting &amp; mental abuse: I had to explain, again, to an old narcissist, sociopath, predator that I'm not really interested in having a relationship with a man who screws everything &amp; everyone in sight. He replied: Oh, so you're saying that you don't want to be with me?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Make 2019 the yr you quite toxic #Facebook &amp; the ridiculous "Be Positive" movement. Instead of reading poster quotes all day let's speak the truth about the deplorable state of humanity &amp; do service work for the earth, animals &amp; all who are struggling. #TheLiesWeAllTellOurselves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He tells me he's busy and won't be around for a few days. But then he pops in and wants to whisk me away on a love bombing adventure. I know his other ego supply's mad at him. I'm just happy to get out of the house &amp; eat something other than eggs. #TheLiesWeAllTellOurselves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was just talking w/ a 60 yr old lady who told me she's a sex addict. She knows The Predator. With sarcasm I said: "I give him credit, he targets older ladies for sex &amp; isn't into young girls." She replied, "Well, us older ladies need attention too." #TheLiesWeAllTellOurselves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Narcissists don't realize they're old. The Predator "complimented" my skin yesterday, he said, "Well, your skin looks good too." He's 20 years older than me &amp; has severe sun damage moles and freckling. He's an old narc surfer. I replied, "Thank you."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator plays the "poor little innocent boy, unlucky in love, angry ex, just looking for a girlfriend" to perfection. He gets his coworkers, managers, even adult children hunting down women for him. These predators have flying monkeys working for them on all fronts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be careful about giving out your number. The TJ Predator collects numbers &amp; when he's bored - which is always - he texts most everyone the same compliments &amp; dumb emojis. He waits to see who'll respond - does more charm talk, invites to dinner &amp; then manipulates to have sex.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These predator type of characters have a lot of energy; they seem ADD. Always on their phone texting, scrolling, taking pics/selfies, posting; always wanting to go out, be the center of attention; always chatten it up w/ someone - collecting names, numbers. Can never be satiated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A narcissist-sociopath will abandon you on Christmas, without a word, and then show back up in your life a few days later if they need a New Year's Eve date. Hmm, he must have already blown up the Christmas Supply. #predator #narcissist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Trader Joe's Predator does a constant ego-check on his attractiveness by love bombing &amp; grooming women to admire him &amp; have sex with him. Most any woman; no standards. Winning the conquest, without standards, gives him reassurance that he's still attractive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just posted "The Sociopath-Predator and Narcissist Father: Grooms, Love Bombs, Devalues, Discards, Trauma Bonding" on Reddit   https://t.co/hEXHKt1uzU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We all should focus on putting out positive energy to strangers. Strangers just make us feel better: They haven't screwed us over or let us down yet. Yes, being nice to strangers is way more fulfilling and doesn't leave me traumatized.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not always. Many narcissists know how to keep their exes groomed with erratic love bombing gestures, inappropriate favors &amp; handyman services. If an ex is lowly, lonely, and trauma-bonded enough, he may be able to keep her in his 'back pocket' for when he needs sex or attention.  https://t.co/kCBUu3csRh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Short summary of The Grooming, Love Bombing, Devaluing, Discarding, Trauma Bonded process of a Sociopath, Narcissist, or Predator. This applies to the Narcissist Father and Child relationship as well.  https://t.co/Th8R3avmLr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @NoradSanta Wow, just look at the talking on the phone with layers of bright makeup, too much cosmetic surgery, and a tight and unnatural smile photo-op. I'd rather have a natural looking and natural acting first family. Shameful. Will America ever recover from such crazy fakeness?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funny how we were all sold a Disneyland fairy tale when in fact marriage and family turns out to be a financially and emotionally devastating institution &amp; the end product, divorce, only profits the court system while forever destroying the mother, children &amp; sometimes father.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're being priced out of our homes - working terrible jobs just to pay rent/mortgage; pets are being discarded &amp; killed in shelters at an all time high becuz we're all stressed &amp; morally &amp; financially destitute; our schools are the worst of any developed nation; gas/food prices<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our economy isn't strong; it's all a mirage. People now working 2-3 terrible jobs just to get below decent healthcare; UI statistics are fake - people fell off the roles or now claim to be "Self Employed" so not to be looked down on - even tho they're not making money ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be careful of anyone who forms their identity around spiritualism, Christianity, bible verses, or even yoga. Healthy &amp; solid people are too busy working, creating, maintaining their home &amp; family &amp; don't have time, nor the inclination, to spout woo-woo stuff with dazed-out eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You have to be good at this - people expect it. Like when someone tells you their age w/ a prideful smile. You're obligated to tell them that you're "shocked ... because you thought they looked so much younger." Even though you really thought they looked way older than their age.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought that was more a Facebook argument?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FLOTUS @USMC @ToysForTots_USA Please be a better role model for our children. Stop the plastic surgery and excessive makeup. And, oh, please stop enabling a #narcissist and #sociopath just to partake in his, evil, shallow, materialistic, greedy lifestyle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolute lie. Inflation in the U.S. is out of control. We're in college loan debt, priced out of housing, can't afford to go to the doctors, &amp; gas, food &amp; entertainment prices are out-of-control. Stop brainwashing sickly &amp; depressed Americans. #sociopath #narcissist #gaslighting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He doesn't want you - to commit to you &amp; be a responsible, reliable, dependable, trustworthy, mature, evolved man - but doesn't want anyone else to have you either. Narcissists have the mental, emotional development of bratty 3-year-olds. They want their cake &amp; eat it too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>School shootings is the symptom of a stressed-out country; parents working 2-3 jobs just to have bad health care &amp; to keep roof over their heads; putting most of income into mortgages/rents; broken families - evil family courts; bad &amp; single-track schools, irrelevant subjects ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's the narcissist's head-games that flip out the target. Also, their plotted, planned &amp; acted out seduction. We're their play objects. As soon as they manipulate us to fall for them, like them &amp; pay attention to them, they feel they won some sort of sick ego game. #Narcissist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"U.S. is doing very well." Really? GM &amp; Ford plants in U.S. are shutting down but not in Mexico. Americans are now working 2-3 jobs &amp; are still being ruined by health care prices. We're priced out of our homes: homeless population is at all time high. Our schools are terrible.  https://t.co/y87dtxZV08<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_PrincessGaby @erikaTreg His new supply either cheated on him, is holding him responsible, or his "fantasy idealization" of her is over. Nah, likely all three of these.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dogaldtrump @jhgurf @BudGothmog44 Not a nice comparison. The furry critter is beautiful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@snapdaily05 @jhgurf Wow, thanks for the side-by-side images and bringing to life the real horrors of aging.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jhgurf @BlueTsuni Cheek implants brought up too high and too severe. Distorted face and eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jhgurf @BlueTsuni Awful plastic surgery. It was all fake news about her. She was never a "super model" &amp; she doesn't really speak 6 languages (a lie spread by the Trump team). English is the preferred second language of all people throughout the world: Yet, she can barely speak English. All lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've said this all along but people got mad &amp; shouted how beautiful she is. No she's not. She's hideous looking. The eyes? Ruined by too much plastic surgery; she's all plastic. Why isn't her obvious mental-illness being discussed more? And plus she's a narcissistic gold-digger!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I get myself into so much trouble by being "friendly &amp; open." I wrongly believe everyone is like me. I never learn the lesson that most people are lowly, superficial &amp; self-centered &amp; use my openness to cause harm in my life so that they somehow feel 'better' about their lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peaceblitz So true! Weird. I woke early this morning, in a state of anger, because he not only does this, but he gets away with it. And you are so right: "Weak minds to agree with the farce" If it weren't for the flying monkeys, these sociopaths/predators wouldn't have such power to destroy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator has an 'In' to people's live. Every #narcissist &amp; #predator has their own 'In' method. His 'In' is the claim that he's a musician, a composer, writing a play. Not so. Most of us have a connection w/ music. He uses this 'In' at Trader Joe's to collect names, numbers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok. We'll just witch hunt you on your lies about the Great Economy. Economy didn't improve: We're now working 2-3 part-time, low-paying jobs w/out benefits &amp; living paycheck to paycheck trying to keep up w/ housing costs, gas prices &amp; inflation. We're not the greatest nation: Lie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The TJ Predator love bombs, dates &amp; sexualizes his adult children. And these old kids are trained to just show up and grab at his free food, money &amp; inappropriate favors. He GROOMS his kids just like he grooms women to fawn over his inappropriate gestures &amp; to have sex with him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coralteal We all blame ourselves, sadly. I blame myself for believing that one day he'd 'see the light' so to speak. I'm a teacher &amp; can't help but teaching. But in reality, it's not our fault for being great helpers, teachers, and forgivers. We just need to be more discerning on with whom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seeks instant gratification. No higher focus or impulse control. Maybe lazy &amp; unmotivated. Depressed and/or lonely people can spend to self-soothe, self satiate. Perhaps obsessed with image 'markers' &amp; winning the approval of shallow people. Perhaps a #narccissist or #sociopath ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>target lurking around TJ after him every 1-2 yrs. Yet, the flying monkeys' support &amp; aid him in his destruction so to take advantage of his inappropriate favors. Work, stores, businesses are not supposed to turn into a creepy Tinder. Do not mix work w/ sex. Only trouble. #MeToo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He seduces co-workers, customers &amp; grooms co-predators at TJ by acting 'the poor innocent boy, unlucky in love, angry ex, just looking for a girlfriend.' He's 70, divorced 4x, 6 kids by 3 diff women, hundreds of women during/between each marriage. #narcissist Now, a different ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He was running late again for our dinner tonight. So I told him that I made other plans. It felt good to have self-worth for once in my life. It takes focus &amp; a forced-effort not to slide backwards &amp; go out to dinner with him. Yet I've done it. But damn am I hungry. #Narcissist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They pull us back in when they're lonely, desperate, between their short-lived relationship jumping, bored, hard-up, need to be validated &amp; 'loved,' to have sex or a place to crash, or they're out of drugs, alcohol, or money; or it can be something as simple as they're hungry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And keep speaking up and out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I found a cd on him, addressed to him: "How to F*ck Your Co-Workers and Friends." I take contention with this cd's title because he doesn't really have "friends:" only people who stroke his ego and temporarily satiates his detached soul &amp; distracts him from his lack of autonomy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He immediately replied, "I can be there on time after all." I didn't respond back. He texted, "Well how 'bout tomorrow?" I replied, "So sorry, I just made other plans for tomorrow." Am I lonely &amp; sad now? Yes. But I'm also trying to act with pride &amp; dignity. #sociopath #Predator<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Predator is always running late for our dates. It's usually the same excuse: "I'm in the middle of painting &amp; I'm at a critical point." He's been painting the same exes house for the past 5 years. Today I responded: Oh, sorry, I made other plans for later. #narcissisticabuse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClaritoKosmic Funny and true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Women in porn aren't really having all those screaming orgasms. They're on a stage - most everything is an act: fake hair, makeup, body parts; special lighting, effects, editing. He was shocked &amp; repulsed that I would ever suggest a crazy notion. #predators #porn #sexaddiction<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I once tried to tell the TJP, who's a sex &amp; attention addict, &amp; a sexual &amp; emotional predator, that women fake orgasms to get freebies. He grooms women w/ love bombing, food &amp; fun to get sex. He replied, "Maybe some women fake, but never with me." #narcissist I further explained:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kind of like all of us, on social media, in general. #Facebook, here, dating &amp; porn sites has destroyed our soul. The rare days that my social media accounts are 'down' for some reason, are the days that I feel less stress, fear, anxiety &amp; chaos. I'm hope to escape the insanity.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The Narcissist and Our Fake Orgasms to Stroke His Ego. I hope you enjoy.:)  https://t.co/9V9S2ktxKD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marion_mkschu Ah, yes. You are so right. I've been trying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Honestly, I don't understand how I'm still alive. I've been running around in a state of anxiety since childhood. I suppose this is why I'm attracted to bad men. I'm not used to peace, ease, and comfort.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the world of a non-narcissist, this may not be our def of "friends." But in the world of narcissism, they're "friends." Albeit, it's a "do for me, I'll do for you" arrangement but aren't most "friendships" like this? If I kept doing for a "friend" &amp; she never did for me? Hmm?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not usually the case. Most #narcissists, #sociopaths, #sexualpredators, &amp; #serialseducers have a lot of "friends." They surround themselves w/ flying monkeys: toxic people that support them, enable them &amp; believe they are helping a "victim" of bad women &amp; bad love relationships.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most feminists I know are mean, b*tchy, manly-aggressive &amp; nasty to both men &amp; even kind women. I believe in male/female roles. It's the only way our society can heal &amp; evolve. I just wish men &amp; women would settle down &amp; stop trying to find their 'fix' through f*cking. #predator<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had no idea that the endless stream of male-workers floating around, out on the floor, intermingling all day long, all year long, w/ desperate, hungry, struggling, aging &amp; forgotten women, was the most convenient, well-disguised &amp; legal predatory/prey zone in the U.S. #metoo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many women become flying monkeys for the narcissist &amp; will help him abuse another woman-another woman who never did anything to her &amp; whom she knows nothing about. Many women are man-crazy &amp; hate other women. What a different world it would be if we defended 1 another-like men do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't believe men haven't caught yet on that they're the only one in love w/ their penis. Penis pics aren't going to impress a woman. What will impress a woman: A focused &amp; hard worker who's saving money for his future &amp; not sitting around on the internet sending penis pics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Society values sociopathy so much because socios/narcs have all the energy &amp; charisma &amp; they are fearless. They act w/out thinking &amp; often succeed. They lie expertly &amp; no one questions them. When they get caught screwing up, they simply deny it, &amp; move on as if nothing happened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plus, when you're w/ the wrong man, better men won't interact w/ you, nor will they consider you possible dating material. Plus, being single is so much fun: cook cool meals; spend time bonding w/ animals; read great books; care for nature/garden; walk therapy; do exercise videos<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@freefinallly Where do you live? I live in SoCalif &amp; I'm miserable. Last night dropped to low 40s &amp; I'm achey. If I'm suffering here: can't imagine elsewhere. And the poor animals that may be left out in the cold across the world. Cold weather makes me think of sad things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The inherent structure of family court is of sociopathy: Enter destroyed/devastated family - children &amp; all suffering. Attorney charges $300/hr - financially devastates &amp; cripples mom/dad/child even more.  Mind you: Teachers, who positively affect the future, get paid $25/hr.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Hollywood rich are spending time doing radio/tv interviews &amp; tweeting about their lost homes - their one lost home out of the many they have - instead of getting out there and helping those - people and animals - who have no more homes left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When a narcissist refers to an ex as a "friend," what he really means is that she's still part of the supply-line; a flying monkey. She's someone he reaches out to for sex, attention, validation, and someone to go to when you're holding him accountable.  https://t.co/m2JZd8qyOt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Using logic &amp; learning from experience (wisdom): Every bad man (even woman) that I've ever met is extremely energetic, highly engaging, and has taken immediate control of our relationship. Going on that ... hmm ... perhaps I should avoid ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't get it. We all learned about the "nice, charming, friendly" facade of killer Ted Bundy a long time ago when many of us were just kids. Yet, every time I try to tell someone about the abuse I endured, it's the same unbelieving response: "But he seems so nice &amp; friendly." ü§®<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why can't people just apologize? When you call someone out on something, even in a nice way, they look at you like you're the bad &amp; horrible one. I guess we all - especially women - have to go around with a big smile - teeth all showing - &amp; act stupid, in order to get along.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sociopaths seek healing in the same places we do: yoga studios; Buddhist temples; churches; new age groups; 12-step programs. They know that they'll find more accepting, open-minded, &amp; beaten-down women in these groups. The perfect breeding ground to love-bomb the depleted soul.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Weird how say a 60ish yr old guy thinks he looks too young to be with a 60 yr old woman &amp; looks @ this same age woman as matronly, but a 45 yr old woman is looking at the 60 yr old man like he's dad. Narcissistic men have such disturbed egos that they don't see how old they look.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#traderjoespredator is similar. He told me that it's ok to lie about his age because he "looks 49." He's 69 also. The Trader Joe's Predator even lied about his age on the application for his most recent job. He, too, lies about his age on Tinder to get younger women to screw him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's impossible to have a healthy &amp; monogamous relationship now days. New supply &amp; the next attention &amp; validation fix is right in their pockets or a click on any ol' site. Technology feeds the instant attention/validation addiction. I'd rather be single, stress-free &amp; just free.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@herworld5 @vicky_riddell @Lyrndah Yes.:)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Once you start seeing the narcissist as an old and/or unattractive, gross loser, dirty pervert who'll screw anyone who shows up: Your healing has begun. Most narcissists aren't attractive. We fell in love w/ them because of what we thought they were offering us: It was a Fantasy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be aware of repeated misnomers. I'm negative, but I'm not toxic. I'm negative because I'm disappointed in humanity &amp; the evil &amp; destruction we lay upon this earth, animals &amp; one another. This propels me to try &amp; wake up humanity; I'm not toxic to anyone. Negative doesn't = toxic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I believe in enlightening the new supply. I'm of the mindset that it's our responsibility to do so &amp; someone should have warned me. I may not have believed it at first, but it would have planted the seeds &amp; I would have gotten out sooner. Instead, I blamed myself for far too long<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's 5:42 pm and already getting dark &amp; cold outside. The next 4 months should be a blast. Our last day of being somewhat alive &amp; hopeful ... What's left of my mental health will be back around February.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everybody's determined to do their own thing, no matter how you try to help. No one listens to anyone. Actually, other people may know what's best for us. They can see things, clearly, from the outside - when we're only seeing things through our own inner, messed up programming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I talked to my high school sweetheart on the phone for the 1st time since high school several years ago. I wanted to believe in love again. He just talked about himself: his PhD; his workout routine &amp; big muscles; &amp; the home he just bought. I lost hope in love; in humans. Ego=bad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be careful when listening to @DrWendyWalsh . She glamorizes dating sites, plastic surgery, and talks in a happy, chirpy voice when speaking of issues that are detrimental to the rest of us. And she makes light of predatory &amp; cheating men - she blames it on, "high testosterone."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrWendyWalsh It's not right that you speak in a chirpy voice when talking about serious issues. It's not right that you advertise plastic surgery &amp; tell us that we should feel bad about aging. It's not right that you promote dating sites w/out discussing the dangerous pitfalls.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm starting to believe that "love" is only for the young - or for our days of "puppy love" - and for our first love around high school or early college. This was when love was pure, innocent, and without an agenda. Every relationship after our first love is pure hell. I give up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I remember being a young girl &amp; having young boyfriend relationships. We weren't evil back then - just exploring love &amp; having fun. Now, every person I meet has an agenda: sex; a favor; a place to stay; financial help; ego stroking. Love isn't fun anymore. Now, it's an agenda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not all sexual &amp; emotional predators are cheapskates. Don't be fooled! Some use generosity to win you over and to get you to let your guard down. Some prey after hungry women, literally hungry; buying them meals as a way to start infiltrating their lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ConanOBrien Comparing yourself to a Trader Joe's cashier is not such a good thing. There's a reason that Trader Joe's has maintained a spotless reputation - more than what meets the eyes. It's a mega cult-like manipulation of health, happiness, &amp; friendliness.  @TraderJoesPrey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ConanOBrien Not necessarily a good thing. Nothing is what it seems. How do you think Trader Joe's keeps such a squeaky clean reputation &amp; avoids all negative media attention? A mega cult-like manipulation of health &amp; friendliness. The truth is starting to unravel at:  https://t.co/xSvmMLFiLo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some things I do to avoid reconnecting with The Bad Man: 1. Nice, relaxing walk w/ my doggie. 2. Go to bed early - read or watch something non-violent. 3. Call my friend who doesn't stop talking - put the phone down, just listen. 4. Cook a healthy meal. 5. Revenge write, here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This terrible &amp; systematic abuse would have never started to begin with if priests were allowed to marry &amp; have their own families. There is nothing normal or logical about stripping a man of his natural sexuality &amp; forcing him into celibacy. People can love both God &amp; family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Normal, healthy couples don't broadcast their loved ones all over social media. They certainly don't broadcast a new &amp; *different* "love of my life-she's the one-she made me a better man-happy life, happy wife" every 6 months to 2 years! You'd think they'd be embarrassed? Nah.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And they're looking for flexible, giving, and generous women on their first date. Women who are willing to wait around if he's late - easily go along with last minute change of time/location of date - order the least expensive item on the menu - &amp; offer to pick up her own meal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The abused are abused more for speaking the truth &amp; the narcissists, sociopaths &amp; predators are rewarded for their skill and adept at remaining steely-silent. The victim talks way too much &amp; shows all their cards whereas the sociopath sits quietly and appears stoic and blameless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonKUhlerLPC Interesting. You are saying there is no ego at play with a predator? I thought everything we do, predator and non-predator, narcissist and non-narcissist, is coming from ego? But, if predators prey as a means to image manage, isn't that ego?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Magick doesn't just manifest out of nothing. We have to work at making things right - take the steps - move energy in the right direction. I'm pretty much done with the new age, spiritual, woo-woo, yogi, guru movement. I've met more predators on this road than on any other.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@POTUS I have a hard time believing there are thousands of people walking thousands of miles to our border. How are they all eating, drinking, sleeping, going to the bathroom? What's happening to the sick, injured, &amp; distraught? Really! I'm tired &amp; hungry after walking 10 miles!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's all about the conquest. Not only the physical and emotional conquest of the prey, but a conquest, per say, of the predator's ego. Their fragile ego depends upon the response they ignite in their prey. The predator determines his worth by our accepting and adoring response.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A person that smiles all the time can actually be faking it, too. Our shallow culture expects people to go around with a big white smile, showing bleached horse teeth, and for no apparent reason. I get stopped on the street by strangers &amp; told, "Smile." Weird culture we live in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peaceblitz People are so fed up and traumatized by humans that we've turned to the animal kingdom for health &amp; healing. It's a sign of human evolution: we're starting to take better care of the animals. In doing this we're not only healing ourselves but the planet. It's all connected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EEmpaths @TracyCampanell These women thought they were saving him from "that bad woman" &amp; that they were going to be the best woman he ever had. Women do more harm to each other than men do to us. If we all rebuked men who were already with or just leaving someone, these men would have nowhere to go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just because they're sexual predators and sex addicts doesn't mean they're good at sex. We just think they are/were good at sex, because we were fantasy idealizing them ... well, because they were fantasy idealizing us. All fantasy and delusion. Both sides.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>... it takes being with some anywhere from 2 months to 2 years to realize who they really are. People don't greet people by cursing at them &amp; spitting on them; of course all people show a nice face to the public. Abuse rarely happens in the middle of parties, or at parks ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just because you see someone around, it doesn't mean that they're safe. Everyone has their public face and their behind-closed-doors face. We don't get to know someone's real face until we're in an intimate relationship with them...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He obsessively hid his phone from me for years. One day I asked him what was going on with his phone, he became defensive. I tried to grab the phone from him .. he grabbed onto it, ran out of the house, and called the police on me. Police did nothing .. still .. non-stop hell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course he seems nice - how else do you think he surrounds himself with a network of supporters so when another one of his relationships falls apart, he's not only supported but he looks like the innocent, nice guy and you look like the crazy b*tch!  https://t.co/vAy58Opbzv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so tired of unthinking people saying, rather repeating in a dead and monotone voice: "Oh, he seems so nice." Of course he "seems nice" - most people "seem nice" at first - I mean he's not gonna go around spitting on people - who does that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#mysociopath<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's all just talk. You know the bloggers &amp; writers who claim to be healed &amp; moving past their narcissist or sociopath. They're not really healed; they're struggling just like the rest of us. They just can't admit to it because they're supposed to be the role models in all this.<|endoftext|>
