<|startoftext|>TODAY - I want to freaking vote this man out of office today before he can do anything else to US! #TrumpTraitor #PutinsGOP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@JohnCornyn SO SENATOR, the President shouldn’t remember if Russia has bounties on our troops?🤬🤬🤬- Sen. Cornyn’s excuse for Trump abt Russian bounties: “Well, I think the president can’t single-handedly remember everything, I’m sure, that he’s briefed on.”<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>THIS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hindsite20 Truth!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So it might be a good idea to vote in people that actually have spent their whole lives working in govt and are interested in policies to help people - not racist, celebrity Con Men!  #TrumpTraitor<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mguggenheim Sir, people are having a tough time right now. Personally, 3 of the four of us in my house are having to work because we are in vital jobs.  To escape a little I would love to see more script pages for #Arrow.  It would be appreciated so much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenKing have you seen this?  😂😭😭😭  https://t.co/nkMyjGrAyZ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It’s just strange, there are two sets of lives going on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone is talking about being housebound and 3 out of 4 in the house of work in vital areas and we are working, struggling to get all the things done at home with the added hours at job and worry about being with groups of ppl.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Leana_Olicityy Eyes 🔒<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Paigeota No, she is going to come in and help save him 🤞🤞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArrowThoughts Felicity provides the lighter side, hope, to the entire show and without that this continual state is hard to stay with.  We’ve done this so many times before, I’m surprised we are here again.  I loved seeing Paul, but frankly OQ had already learned this lesson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArrowThoughts Completely agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smoakxdoe @Wayoflife4587 Ben with that cup!! ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Leana_Olicityy Toast?  Crackers?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lexiblackbriar That last scene with Quentin got me 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jbuffyangel Still sucks, arrow still nothing but pain sigh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lexiblackbriar So am I<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smoakinqtech @Wayoflife4587 He just wants a snuggle and this to be over- bring him his woman people!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lexiblackbriar That’s what I keep saying!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oIiversfeIicity Should have someone on that couch with him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andreasmoaks RIGHT THERE!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the hell?  #arrow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Janalicity @teamstemily What?  Where is this from? ❤️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@fsmoakbett Yaaaassss, that works for me ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Janalicity @AnnieGabbes Is that Em in the back w black hat on?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mguggenheim You re intentionally putting us in the emotional wringer.  I think that you could help us get through by umm... realeasing old script pages, sending out a few hints, or even margaritas because this is hard to handle! 😭😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@snarky_bee @annouskag We appreciate your spiral and join you for the trip 🔥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MG_daliaa Maybe the Jersey was a gift from someone 🤡<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@babblesqueen Jeans would work, I’m just sayin’<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@annouskag @Wayoflife4587 @Iightsmyway @Cilya11 @CynthiaAyman Really good!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lyricalarrow @KenyaJ121 @SchwartzApprovd @TheSoko It hurt his heart to see her hurt 😢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ENSM31 🤷‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ENSM31 They are going to be flashed into future?  That way they won’t be in old makeup all the time is my guess<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So sad we didn’t get any #OTA and BTS pics from the #Arrow wrap party.  Seems such a silent way to end a show that we all love. The reason I fell in ❤️ with this show was the personal relationship Btw @david_ramsey @StephenAmell and Emily Bett.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@serenity121084 @luhhay1 He is going to be so pissed, didn’t seem to have much of a sense of humor<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_infinitecanvas @lexiblackbriar @callistawolf I want it all!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ENSM31 That’s when he gets to Felicity and all is well with our hero 😍. Ok, this needs to happen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IArrowverse @srt4rls @lyricalarrow @mariapiarrow He doesn’t know that though... he wouldn’t know her 😭😭😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_infinitecanvas Yes, yes, yes and he can be loved and with his loved ones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lexiblackbriar @callistawolf Oh good gracious-  that’s terrible 😭😭😭. Our hearts can only take so much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LadyMris @KenyaJ121 @CathyFou64 That’s what I’ve always thought 🥰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KenyaJ121  https://t.co/gt1SDLZ9pp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lust_muffin He needs to believe that of his Em Bett too!  😭😭😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@callistawolf 😂😂. Like we don’t know what is happening<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_infinitecanvas End scene<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EgyptDiva Be damned the green room or anyone else.. 😭😭😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OlicityShipper3 Spider-Man?  😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kez2009 Well as crazy SA is for #Olicity and Em Bett I think he might’ve insisted to come back for that last season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lyricalarrow This is a beautiful couple right here, they deserve it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lyricalarrow @jbuffyangel David 😂😂😂😂 is us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmellDaily Why is JH and SA all snuggled through this and photo shoot🤨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@callistawolf Gossip girl?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fangirlish @StephenAmell Loves his girl 💕💕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thaller223 Oliver from legends, old guy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iightsmyway So mean 😟<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@knockknockjoan I’ll take it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoodbyeOta Is this when SA said he was coming to New York to see Em’s play?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sriisme This scene is so good though, he was really going there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leanneaguilera @EmilyBett @StephenAmell Great interview thank you @leanneaguilera !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smoakxdoe @ARROWwriters Thank you!  I know I was very lucky and I sure have enjoyed this ride, sad to see it end 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lyricalarrow 🔥🔥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sojournen07 Love, love jealous Oliver, he does play it so well 🥰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sojournen07 Do you know other as libs beside SA looking at Felicity’s hair color?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Paigeota Wasn’t she already under contract?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPN_FreakSaumya @serenity121084 I was looking for it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sojournen07 I was mentally pushing him into her 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smoakxdoe @ARROWwriters I just had a possible cancer diagnosis and after surgery binge watched the first few seasons while waiting for word.. OTA really made me laugh and provided a great thing for me to focus on while I waited.  Thankfully I’m healthy but totally addicted to this show and Olicity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KenyaJ121 Can someone just film him as he watches her play?  Please?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@babblesqueen @AnnieGabbes He needs excuses to see her, she needs to come on back!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OlicityDreams Looks like he’s been crying there 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KenyaJ121 Yes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhenWatchingTV @AnnieGabbes Hope it’s better than the love letter promised.. just need them back together raising those babies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Karen_AUS After all she was insistent that Felicity was evil 🥴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lyricalarrow Just hoping the duo is back at it and leaves this bird mess behind<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@knockknockjoan @serenity121084 Thought the same thing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Paigeota Now that is the content I’ve been waiting for, not awkward interview answers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EgyptDiva Now he confirmed how sad he was, you can see it in his eyes 😞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KenyaJ121 Nobody keeps bae out of finale if he has any say 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lyricalarrow We are fragile here..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KenyaJ121 😂😂😂😂 win!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lexiblackbriar Give too much away for the season?  Seems like a strange question not to ask in interview.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luhhay1 Wait.. LL isn’t even on any of the Arrowverse other shows 🤨🤨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@svenrobinkahl Ghostbusters<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lyricalarrow Those dimples flashing 🥰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KenyaJ121 So, sorry for your loss and loss to UVA.  I also went there, but not for law.  God bless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ejerasmus @kez2009 @smoakqueenfam Then  drinks her drink, cause that’s what friends are for 🥰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hotcookinmama2 @AnnieGabbes Maybe they’ll go onto comic mode with Felicity!  That’ll burn some birds!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lyricalarrow Love this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuneArrow272 Still broken weeks later 😭😭. So many emotions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pennyaray It would crush her is my guess or he wouldn’t be able to leave her to go there expecting to die 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@olicityjoy @AnnieGabbes While he was saving everyone else, Diggle and Felicity were saving him ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VernicadeJesus6 We sure are going to miss getting good stuff from #sdcc this year 😭😭<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Sojournen07 @Pure_Fandom @lynsneill @Olicity_News @StarlingCityJ @ARROWTV_ @ARROWwriters He can’t even look up at her<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Mayflower_2 I really miss the way they would be together on screen, what a waste 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lane1812 @SchwartzApprovd I often wonder if the crazier part of fandom that sends hate email, tweets to Stephens wife etc has caused them to write that stuff out.  They don’t post stuff together as much anymore.. miss it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Will be sorely missed.  I will miss #felicitysmoak #arrow and #olicity.  I hardly ever watch regular tv and yet this pulled me in.  Let’s hope @SchwartzApprovd finishes as strong with all the little touches we 💗 4/4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That people connect with, and this also happened with OTA. The writers could be that good to put all of that in there or the actors have added pieces of themselves along the way.. either way, the light hearted banter, the strong female character that is@totally respected 3/4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The characters of Felicity and Oliver have been fleshed out unlike most characters to me, reminds me more of a novel than tv. Their story together and all of the little touches 💋🔥 hands, shoulders, staring, and the natural chemistry have given a realistic feel 2/4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I came in late to Twitter fandom w #Arrow.  However I’ve really enjoyed listening to the #watchover podcast and going back to see all of the tweets, gifs, from fans  about #Olicity and now hearts breaking over show ending and @EmilyBett leaving early.  1/3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@callistawolf Bring it all, it is gonna be bad.  https://t.co/TLvfZthDZW<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jbuffyangel who was the guy.. Chris Smith?  That you said to read.  I’ve listed to your podcasts so many times I can’t remember which one mentioned it.  Thanks!  You and Calli keep up the great work!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michie8 The Vigilante documentary would be ‘evidence’ to support her #interesting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@watchover_cast do you think any of the “crazy” part of the fandom is making a difference in the writing of the show?  I have been astonished at the level of extreme reactions on Twitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OlicityDreams Sooo bitter #dammit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amellsarrrow Sexiest look I have ever seen  https://t.co/f5ahvWyUxK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jh24098 @watchover_cast Same.. for a love letter we didn’t get #OTA just more of the newbies. Dinah had more time with Oliver than Felicity and screen time 🤢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenniferVera199 @watchover_cast That life stole her parents from her?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StephenAmell So sorry for the loss to the #Arrow family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jbuffyangel Love your reviews, podcasts, so glad you’re better!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dust2dust34 I always think that’s when he is trying not to break character with her 😁<|endoftext|>
