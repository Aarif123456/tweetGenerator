<|startoftext|>That was John DiIulio’s term. I never used it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#masskillings (i.e. #massshootings with 4+ victims killed), of which there are about two dozen a year, have been a problem in the U.S. for decades. But, this doesn’t reflect a raging epidemic. It is a catalyst for #guncontrol which will impact   the 11,000 gun homicides annually.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>300 people die every year in cases wher 4+ are shot. About 10,000 die every year is single victim shootings. That’s where the big problem lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely. Read my usatoday opinion columns. I’m wholly supportive of #guncontrol because of the 31 gun homcdes that occur daily.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These mass shootings average 1 death per incident. In terms of deaths, the big problem is not mass shootings, but gun homicides (11,000 per year). #GunControlNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How many minutes until the next gun homicide? 46 minutes. Shootings involve a wide range of injury. Th clearest and unambiguous is a fatality. That's also why I track trends in #masskillings not so much #MassShootings .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In 590 days since 1/1/18, there have been 601 mass shootings (4+ shot), more cases than days. These claimed 652 lives (some the shooter). That's 1.1 fatalities on ave.  All victims matter. But then, we should focus on the 31 victims fatally shot every day in the US. #GunControl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All shootings matter of course. But when people hear hundreds of mass shootings in the aftermath of a large scale mass killing, they get confused into thinking events like El Paso happen daily.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@propanegirl1964 @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump @nickgillespie @reason @BarackObama FYI just be careful with the MJ data.

<|startoftext|>How many fatalities? Not including the shooter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lylsberg @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump @nickgillespie @reason Your chart is wrong. There were not over 15K gun homicides. Those were all homicides.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JeannieR207 @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump @nickgillespie @reason @GOP @NRA Those are mass killings and they are awful. But there are not hundreds every year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those mass shootings are not like the horrors that prompted them. Half of those don’t involve any deaths and 1/4 only 1 (which may o Lu be the shooter)  using mass shooting stats to gauge mass killings is like agh sssault stats to gauge homicide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here are the trends in mass killings involving guns.  https://t.co/1PUwppah6u<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What about mass killings wher lots of victims for? In your map only 7% involve 4+ killed. Also your nap, I presume in for 2013-2019. Why don’t you look at a map for 2003-2009 to determine trend. You can’t. With mass killings you can look st trend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You are misled by hearing about mass shooting stats which need not involve any deaths in the aftermath of a mass killing. Not the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you know how many there were in 2010 or 2005 or any other year? No one does   Well in terms of mass killings with a gun, as opposed to mass shootings (where less than 25% claim miltiple lives) we can. And there has not been the growth that you are imagining.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoctorOcelot Absolutely. Enacting tighter gun control measures, especially universal background checks and limits on the size of large capacity magazines, may not prevent mass killings, but it is the right thing to do for the more than 30 gun homicides that occur daily in the US. #GunControl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely.

<|startoftext|>It is meant to reflect the fact that short-term spikes in crime are typically followed by declines. In technical terms, it’s called “regression to the mean.” But in the context of a podcast for a broader audience, “what goes up generally comes down,” makes the point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Contagion effects come and go. The 8 multiple-victim school shootings from 1996-2001 shocked the nation. Then after the 9/11 terrorist attack, the focus shifted to a different threat. There were no additional multiple-victim school shootings for nearly 4 years. #MassShootings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly, unless you are looking for something significant enough. The AP/USA Today/Northeastern Univ database collects data on all mass killings with 4+ killed dating back to 2006. Even with that victim threshold, going back much further would be challenging.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is a case of finding needles in a haystack. Countless Americans are angry, write ugly words in social media sites, own guns, play violent video games, are isolated, etc., but a small few turn their angst into action. Warning signs are only clear with hindsight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The inability to find cases in early years. Eg, only 1 in entire US in 2000? As proof: 9% of cases in 2000-03 killed no one, whereas 27% in  2014-17 killed no one.  Either recent active shooters are lousy marksmen, or early cases with 0 or 1 killed were not found in news search.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is it that many news articles say there are hundreds of #MassShootings each yea,  then only cite examples of #MassKillngs? Do they want to create hysteria and mass confusion ? There are about 2 dozen shootings each year in which 4+ victims are killed. @AP<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Well, since the rise is only in the past two years, I wouldn't say that changes in weaponry have been that recent. However, over the longer term that the largest death tolls have tended to be more recent than distant, the effect of weaponry can be implicated in that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yes there has been a rise in public mass shootings starting in 2017...possible contagion.

<|startoftext|>A slight majority of mass killings involve family members as victims. Of course, that is DV in the extreme. But most mass killers do not have a history of DV. Only about 16% of all mass killings and about 30% of family mass killings had evidence of previous DV. #domesticviolence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TessEractica Yes, per Everytown for Gun Safety, 54% involve family members as victims. But also in their data, only 16% had a history of DV. You can't say most Mass Killers had history of DV because the mass killing itself was DV.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TessEractica I do not exclude them at all. Take a look at this column:  https://t.co/l8edVQbPt4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TessEractica Actually, I include family massacres in the database, whereas others (eg Mother Jones) excludes them. Nearly half mass killings are family annihilations. Still the majority of family massacres are not preceded by other DV incidents<|endoftext|>
