<|startoftext|>@Sea__Point @JamieBehan @tobiL22 Very true perspective.  In the 11th and 12th centuries it was smaller scale.

<|startoftext|>@momlgn @welfare_ie 100%  People with @DownSyndromeIRL and many other Intellectual Disabilities DO HAVE competency and desire for many jobs.  Employment initiatives wouldn't expect a qualified tradesman to take employment as a Pilot, so why think a PwID should be shoe-horned into unsuited role.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@momlgn @welfare_ie @AnneRabbitte And it IS a "whole of State" task.  That's why the UN recommends that Disability be within the responsibility and Department of the "Prime Minister" which is truly Cross-Departmental.  @MichealMartinTD could be one of the few who would, but coalition with SF/SocDems/Lab better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@momlgn @welfare_ie @AnneRabbitte A vision, without a "more of the same" strategy, with a 5/10/15/20 year cross-party agreed direction, with ongoing comprehensive assessment and date capture.  Emphasis HAS TO BE on Outcomes, with a real desire to "get it right" rather than short term appeasing groups.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@momlgn @welfare_ie Needs an overhaul of the way Ireland addresses Disability and Care.  Tinkering around the edges just exacerbates the problem.  @AnneRabbitte seems to be a strong capable Jr Minister who could drive it, but it's got to be supported and provided with temporary Transition resources.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@momlgn Double-Whammy.  Ireland has EUs lowest level of #Disability #Employment.

<|startoftext|>@caromom_irl @JohPau @McNiffecent @hrbireland @SocDems @DisabilityFed @JohnDolanDFI @InclusionIre @NatFedVolBodies I was thinking that the @citizensinfo Citizens Advice Bureau could be trained to assist people completing the form.  @CarersIreland and @DisabilityFed and @InclusionIre and others could promote and guide people to completing it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohPau @caromom_irl @McNiffecent @hrbireland @SocDems @DisabilityFed @JohnDolanDFI @InclusionIre @NatFedVolBodies True.

<|startoftext|>@caromom_irl @McNiffecent @hrbireland @SocDems @DisabilityFed @JohnDolanDFI @InclusionIre It would be the @NatFedVolBodies who could get that number, but as the data is supposed to be input into NASS by their member organisations, they are part of the problem.

<|startoftext|>@AilbheConneely @AnneRabbitte The primary Government disability supports planning tool, the HRB NASS, is farcical.  It's not even a reasonable sample, never mind a national database.  It needs to be put on a legally obligatory basis. DA2005 P2!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AilbheConneely @AnneRabbitte If Ireland is genuinely serious about fixing a very very 3rd World disability and social care system, we urgently need accurate and transparent data. That means proper assessment of needs compared to current delivery.  Need Part2 S7 to 23 of Disability Act 2005 to be commenced.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AilbheConneely @AnneRabbitte Isn't the ‚Ç¨100m just funding to make Disability Day Services Covid19-Safe?  Services now only able to deliver 40-50% of Pre-Covid levels.  It's not delivering anything additional, just essential funding to hopefully "stand still".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SocDems @HollyCairnsTD We have the 2nd lowest support for disabilities in EU as a % of GDP.  Don't even know what country MT is!  Check with @DisabilityFed for data source.  https://t.co/zMw3k5nRO1<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EamonRyan Not too many EVs which can be modified for wheelchair access.  Could you please get your Colleagues in Government to Very Quickly fix the Primary Medical Certificate problem and the Disabled Drivers and Passengers Scheme.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@caromom_irl @McNiffecent @hrbireland NASS Database has been neutered since transitioning from NIDD and NPSD databases. Must be made Self-assessment and let HSE do Spot Checks, like Revenue self-assessment. Also need to look beyond just 5 years. @SocDems correctly identified this pre-election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@caromom_irl @McNiffecent I think there a few other steps needed. How do we prove inequality or the lack of delivery of the CRPD in the Data and Evidence Vacuum. Need Disability Act Part2 Sections 7 onwards to be Commenced, and put legal obligation on HSE to identify gaps between supports and needs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@caulmick UPDATE.  Turns out it was CHARITY from Community and Voluntary help from @SVP_Ireland and a couple of Local Councillors and Local Businesses which solved this crisis.   https://t.co/tqbJN073A6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SiobhanBryan4 In truth though, if it helps Disability Services to return to Pre-Covid levels, it will reduce physical and mental exhaustion and burn-out, but still not addressing poverty and the Cost of Disability for ANYONE in the household.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SiobhanBryan4 I must have missed the bit about "and their families".  If you mean the ‚Ç¨150. That ‚Ç¨0.41c per day will be more than absorbed by the increased Home Heating and Clothes washing/drying cost of supporting a person with a disability at home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@momlgn @SocDems @labour @sinnfeinireland @PBPDL I'd much rather be at the bottom of the social pile in a Socialist regime than a Right-wing regime! It could be the difference between ultra-poverty and a "disappeared".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@momlgn @SocDems @labour @sinnfeinireland @PBPDL The other factor which is often confused with Socialism is "Authoritarianism". It's probably even more common in Right wing politics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@momlgn In the Irish Context it's a bit different as the level of leftism is quite blurred on Disability. Seems @SocDems and @labour and @sinnfeinireland are similar, and @PBPDL are also strong disability rights and equality advocates, even though more proponents of "State Ownership".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@momlgn You probably need to differentiate between the degrees of Socialism. Social Democracy has usually been good for Disability and Carers. The further left you go, Democratic Socialism -&gt; Trotskyism -&gt; Communism..less so. One main difference is the level of State Control.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mdmak33 @FineGael Was Hugo invited?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dermot_finn @DesMorgan9 @sjogcs @hse Their huge defect is purely (99% anyway) down to them being a charitable religious order with 100+ years in protecting the vulnerable and pumping their own accumulated reserves and assets into funding their mission. Those funds and assets are now depleted. Time to call "foul".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dermot_finn @DesMorgan9 @sjogcs @hse Please explain why.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjogcs @hse From our perspective, we can see a positive *short term* outcome from this situation.  It may mean that finally the HSE and the Department of Health will have to admit that the budgets are insufficient, and end up being realistic about funding.  @orlaryan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2/2 HSE ended up increasing the budget by in excess of 25%!  It could NOT be done on the funding offered.  However, and this is critically important, over the subsequent years the services were farmed out to agencies and eventually deteriorated‚Äù @orlaryan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As happened back in 2012 with Cregg House Services, The HSE said ‚Äúprovide the services with this much money‚Äù to which the Service Provider said It couldn‚Äôt be done, and like St John of Gods are now doing, handed the responsibility over to the HSE.  1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjogcs @hse It‚Äôs important to remember ‚Äòthere is NO Right to any service‚Äô and if HSE just cuts 1 or 2 or 3 elements of an integrated service approach, there‚Äôs no comeback.  Which services will be targeted?  Respite? Transport? Employment Supports? Cut day services from 5 days to 3? @orlaryan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjogcs @hse If the HSE take over management of our services, and dictate that there shall be no additional funding, we need to know where the HSE propose to make cost reductions.  Which services will they cut back?  Which policy mandated services would they choose to  ignore?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>over 50 years our Parents Family and Friends Association has fundraised millions, from bucket shaking and organising Quiz Nights and Golf events and Christmas fairs and cake sales, to invest in additional supports which our children need, which the @HSELive simply wouldn‚Äôt fund<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>this situation has come about because the Services, not just @sjogcs, have had to financially subsidised the shortfall in HSE funding.  Services for people with disabilities are dictated by State Policy Documents, but funding always been inadequate to deliver these services.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ID services could and should be so much better than they are, but we know that @sjogcs has checked under every cushion and under every bit of furniture to find any loose change they can find to pay for the services our children need<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>families have been fighting for years for better services for our family members and now the State is actually saying that the Services they have been getting, which are directed by HSE Policies, are not deliverable within the budget provided by the HSE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DesMorgan9 @sjogcs @hse 1 or 2 selfish greedy manipulating self-service tossers should not be used as an example to taint the picture of 3,000 Social Care professionals and Volunteers who do the best they can with what they have got.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was in a meeting where a Senior HSE Manager told Minister for Health @donnellyStephen that #Disability Services were under-funded and @sjogdse had "put their hands down the back of every couch" to find any loose change.  That was a couple of years ago. Will he remember?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More Dark clouds on the horizon for the #Intellectual #Disability community.  Parents must not allow services to be butchered BEFORE the HSE takes over.  They can't be allowed to blame the "Previous Management".  Let them fight the stakeholders.  https://t.co/Tp3QvE2Tli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@momlgn Let's not forget that so many people with disabilities are capable and hungry for a paying job. It's government policy to hide them away in poorly funded "Day Wasting Services". I know many young @DownSyndromeIRL  adults who want the self esteem and comeraderie and Money of work.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CllrDeanMull @KenHarp35576228 How many times do you need to hear and see the mathematical possibilities for forming a Left government?  No likelihood without another election, and FFG will do everything in their box if tricks to skupper that outcome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mcollins1922 @CllrDeanMull It was #VoteForBetter, #Investinbetter, #voteforchange that got them elected!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrishTimes Is there really any difference between there being unelected influencers behind SF and unelected greed influencers behind FFG? Arguable as to which is more detrimental? If true, it's 6 of 1 and a half dozen of the other.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JFTAXI Must have a read of that. Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daithi84 @dublinsportsfan @fotoole Councillors have NO authority over planning. FG reduced local democracy to kindergarten photo opportunities. Worst actual level of democracy in EU.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MerriganMl @fotoole @MichelBarnier @LeoVaradkar Let them. The UK hasn't got a good track record, over hundreds of years, of being honourable and delivering on pacts and agreements. Now that the Elite are firmly back in control, expect deception and deceit. Ireland and EU should do what's good for them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichealMartinTD That won't be possible if @fiannafailparty forms a governing relationship with FG.  The programme for Government would be constrained and limited by old world staid thinking about raising the funds needed to deliver what you agree the electorate voted for. SF or force Election2.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvanYatesNT seems surprisingly impressed with @HollyLeahCairns. I'm impressed, but not surprised. There's great new blood in D√°il √âireann. And good to see it's fresh Political thinking from fresh political movements. @SocDems #TonightVMTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@c_oreilly More that HSE Policy doesn't detail how it will be paid for. How does a @NatFedVolBodies Service Provider meet these costs while having budgets reduced?  The FG HSE answer is "Reduce Service by Stealth". McGrath couldn't keep them in check.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@c_oreilly Lease is up on "New Directions" in-community hub. New building needs extensive remodeling to suit needs. Service provider can't afford it. In absence of HSE capital funding, putting Emotional Blackmail on families for nearly ‚Ç¨200,000.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Parents asked to find ‚Ç¨7,440 each to "Maintain" #Disability Service for their young adult children.  That's On-Top of reduced #Respite and unequal access to #SocialHousing, so forced to live with 80yr old Mammy till she dies.  How would you like to live like Ireland's disabled?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Delighted that RTE are replaying the HSE "F-You" episode while Ireland is considering the make-up of the 33rd D√†il. It's part of why the country voted as it did.

<|startoftext|>@Trish_houlihan @mdmak33 @SeanDefoe Perhaps if people understood Tactical Voting, rather than the herd mentality, we could have made this election effective as a vote for change.

<|startoftext|>@TonightVMTV @irishdailymail More words. They have had 9 years to.... - Incentivise Construction Careers, - Build instead of inflating prices with HAP and unaffordable developer led builds, - allow Council's to meet local needs,<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AddressingLife Problem = that the national appetite for change only saw SF as the way to do that. Understandable given lingering resentment about Labour, and the SocDems still unknown to many.  Fact is that people voted change, but FF and FG will drag it out and spin it to suit themselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Birds in the trees and Dogs on the street know that a @fiannafailparty and @sinnfeinireland + either @greenparty_ie or @SocDems or @labour is the only realistic (vote honouring) government formation.

<|startoftext|>@electionlit There is no possible way that SF could enter government with FG.  They are totally incompatible given the social circumstances of Ireland 2020.  Any real focus has to be on either: FF + SF + other, or FF + FG + other.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From a #Disability perspective there is another positive outcome from #GE2020.  The FF Disability spokesperson wasn't up to much, and wasn't elected.

<|startoftext|>@JosephL29006738 @IzzyKamikaze I would prefer to change the language and concept of "contribution" to active participation or something else.  Contribution implies that you serve.

<|startoftext|>@JosephL29006738 @IzzyKamikaze Nope Joe. I'm offline for a few days. As Carers, we highly prize the opportunities to do stuff like normal people. Bliss.

<|startoftext|>@suzybie All people and disabilities are different. Some need more of xyz than others. For some it's accessibility in the built environment and public transport.

<|startoftext|>@OConnorOisin @davidhall75 That was my point.   If a Taoiseach has the Balls, they can appoint achievers to Seanad, and co-opt to Ministerial Positions.

<|startoftext|>#GE20 From any perspective, there is NO point in having a Minister, for ANY portfolio, who has not been emersed in the subject.

<|startoftext|>If Given ‚Ç¨1Bn, do you actually think @FinianMcGrathTD would know how best to allocate it?   State doesn't even have the research to make decisions. Purposely!!!  So, does the Minister ask for what is needed?  Or would it be the usual "spread it around for Max political capital"?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the #PennyPinching is compounded by Govt Ministers and Senior Civil Service continuously fooling the general population with completely misleading #SPIN about Financial Inputs, when they refuse to even collect and collate DATA about what the fix would look like in reality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Important to say that this isn't a thread about #Carers.

<|startoftext|>@davidmcw Ah DMcW You know long term planning and necessary big decisions are not compatible with our political short-term parochial system.  By the time WE do anything, it's too late.  Irish politics is about promises of a Fiver here and there, and sticky tape on everything else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidhall75 Agree. Why do we elect people that then need so many Special Advisors?  OK, so as we have matured into SPIN over Substance politics I guess they need spin doctors.  Temporary solution... Taoiseach can appoint Senators and make them Ministers. Undemocratic, but better than this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>8/ and then sidestep and ignore the Human Rights contained in Art 19 of #CRPD by removing choice of where and with whom our now completely vulnerable person lives.  Since 2005, both @fiannafailparty and @FineGael and @labour have refused to commence the Disability Act.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>7/ Parents have popped their clogs or have gone beyond mild dementia and can't cope.  What does our caring government and HSE do?

<|startoftext|>5/  We works our Butts off, and yet most don't qualify for #Carers Allowance, if 1 parent is on Minimum Wage.

<|startoftext|>@c_oreilly Context needed.  Budget 2020 provided for 59 new places apparently. 800+ in crisis.  What has been happening is reliance on "Bed Churning". Someone has to die for another to be accommodated.  Dire circumstances have been placed in ordinary Nursing Homes or Back to Institution.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To add context. Plan was to transition 4500 people from institutions by 2017. Didn't happen. Still 2000. 50% passed away.  Meanwhile, crisis/emergency list reaches 800+. Plan needed for 10,000 people with Intellectual Disabilities.  But it has actually contracted.  https://t.co/j0OckmT0t5<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ireland won't even appropriately fund the current number of people with a disability.  As disabled population has increased, funding and frontline services have reduced.  Supported Living (and Residential Services) just 1 example.  https://t.co/FW6Cg2Wrox<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MarkTIRL @aCandoattitude @SeanJustGotHere @OCaoilte09 @drvconway @rte They were not RIC at all. They were purely B&amp;T. Jeez Mark. I know you are a Barrister, but at some point you have to stop arguing for the same of it. Haven't I said we are on the same page?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MarkTIRL @aCandoattitude @SeanJustGotHere @OCaoilte09 @drvconway @rte On the same page. Just dont like how current government party are trying, in their typical fashion, to cover all general bases when there's no cost involved, by also including the B&amp;Ts in the Honour Roll.  I can appreciate the monument to the queen, in Dun Laoghaire, as part 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkTIRL @aCandoattitude @SeanJustGotHere @OCaoilte09 @drvconway @rte Well we are on the same page Mark. The B&amp;Ts, unlike the RIC, were not Irish, but rather unemployed ex-army in need of work. Fodder of the British Ascendency Class, just like the trenches of WW1.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkTIRL @drvconway @rte Agree, but apparently the current administrators of the State are expressly including B&amp;Ts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkTIRL @drvconway @rte Does Germany celebrate the formation of the SD or SS?

<|startoftext|>@MikScarlet @cfs_jo What's LDP?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikScarlet @cfs_jo Unfortunately I have met too many that look down their noses about ID.  Maybe it's because the system differentiates between a PA and Social Care.  Maybe they are too "normal" by which I mean frustrated dealing with people who have less intellectual capacity.  Pisses me off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikScarlet @cfs_jo "takes bow".  I enjoyed it too.  Important to seek equality for all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikScarlet @cfs_jo So the lesson for this evening is.....  Proxy Parents and not necessarily POXY Parents! üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikScarlet @cfs_jo Again, I agree that disabled people must lead the fight, absolutely!, But include PROXY for those that can't stand at the barricades, and would otherwise be left out. So... Don't Exclude Proxy Parents of those who can't represent themselves. That's all I ask.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikScarlet I mostly agree with you about society. But little wins tend to be around accessibility or transport or employment or allocation of housing. To most of our community, that is the low hanging fruit which makes no difference whatsoever (to us), but WE fight for it for all too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikScarlet @cfs_jo You may think you are fighting for all disabilities, but sit back for a minute and have a think about it. When was the last time you interacted with someone with a Profound ID?  What did they tell you? What do they want or need which may be outside your "norm" for advocacy asks?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikScarlet @cfs_jo But not if you continuously bang the damn drum that Family Carers cannot be included. In our situation, Family Carer is effectively a Proxy. Otherwise there are no seats at the table of the Disability Leaders deciding on strategy to achieve equality. Echo chambers don't work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikScarlet I get that. I may have a decade of interacting with people with Physical and sensory disabilities, and will always make sure they are included and heard, but my point is that you must include the Equality of my ADULT child with ID. Something which is generally overlooked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikScarlet @cfs_jo I have been an unpaid disability advocate for the best part of a decade. But I step into my daughter's shoes, because nobody else can or will.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikScarlet @cfs_jo What I'm saying is: Decision Making Representatives of people with Severe/Profound ID must be considered as exactly that. You surely don't think that you can speak for them? What's important is expressing and representing the "Will &amp; Preference" of the person, not the carer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikScarlet @PerplexedSeal @CarlaKCoach As I said. I subscribe to 'Will &amp; Preference' and Social Model.  Neither you, nor some paid NGO ceo, will or can include the lived experience of people with Extensive Support Needs, with limited Capacity or Communication.  #NothingAboutHerIfYouDontHearHer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikScarlet This thread raises an important issue. Why is it that ALL Disabilities can't work together? People with Physical/Sensory Disabilities frequently dissociate themselves from people with Moderate/Severe/Profound Intellectual Disabilities. If parents can't represent them, who will?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cfs_jo @MikScarlet In short NO. The priorities and needs of different disabilities may overlap. Accessibility, education, employment, independence, are higher priorities for people with Physical/Sensory disabilities and Mild ID. Not the highest priorities for people that have less capacity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PerplexedSeal @CarlaKCoach @MikScarlet Are you convinced that people with physical or sensory disabilities have the visceral feel for the experience of people with severe/profound Intellectual Disabilities?  If not, please don't generalise. Please specify "in relation to Physical/Sensory (and perhaps even MH)".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crip_tic @MikScarlet I have yet to meet a disabled person that can represent my Adult Daughter anywhere near as well as I do. I subscribe to "will and preference" and Social Model.

<|startoftext|>@TinaMurnotbot The HSE is built on this scheme.  Services provided by 3rd party (section 38 and 39 orgs).

<|startoftext|>@SimonHarrisTD Does that include people with Intellectual Disability, or do they still need to wait for your Government to actually Commence the Assisted Decision Making Act?  People.

<|startoftext|>@mickmac12345 @thejournal_ie Is a person with a disability, who can't find or get work, classified as a scrounger, or is it the role of the state (society) to band together to support those that can't support themselves?

<|startoftext|>@mickmac12345 @thejournal_ie Looking after our elderly and disabled is more important than locking up prisoners. Let's divert that cash to a more beneficial application!

<|startoftext|>@Hippoclides @humphreys @AlexWhiteSC "Dude" is a matter for generational interpretation. A bit like "Sick". U chose negative interpretation. Longer life in 60s, 70s or even 80s would have been cool. Now it is different. Medical advances outpacing societal momentum by a quantum level. Role of Govt to manage that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tfoale @BorisConSome1 @Jms7777Justin Agree, but like politics, the cycle of wealth creation is relatively opportunist and short-term, with no personal consequences for f'ing it up for anyone else.  A billion made in a few years is a dynastic legacy. Never mind the peasants.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hippoclides @humphreys @AlexWhiteSC That's the problem with modern Neo-Liberalism or Conservatism "Dude". And until we have a Social Policy, as we did with Mr. Whittaker, we will never have a society in which our elderly can age with appropriate grace for having made their contribution. Don't want USA model.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tfoale @BorisConSome1 @Jms7777Justin That's a piss poor position to have. Low consumption locally will be ignored by massive wealthy industrialists.

<|startoftext|>@Hippoclides @humphreys @AlexWhiteSC Think it was "Dude".  Was you point not that living longer was a positive? My point is that it is conditional upon being supported to have a Quality of Life! It's commonly referred to as Well-being.... Not in a USA Healthcare Lobbyist context.... In a " I want to keep living" way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shane_RossTD Shockingly inappropriate tweet. Yourself and Finian have lost your way. What is it they say about "Power Corrupts". Gorilla chest beating about marginal ‚Ç¨ inputs is NOT the same as Beneficial Societal Outcomes.  Think you have been "Outed".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hippoclides @humphreys @AlexWhiteSC Guess that depends on your quality of life in the extra years.

<|startoftext|>@caulmick Terrible narrative. All charities run surpluses. It's Cashflow Vs Assets.  A property on the books is not a liquid asset, and if it was sold, where do people sleep.

<|startoftext|>@AddressingLife @JohPau @ProfoundIreland Successive governments have avoided investing in Supports to meet the needs of a growing population, resulting in a huge and costly problem for which they are afraid to make the funding commitment, because they don't think the public would support it. @InclusionIre @SenatorJDolan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohPau @deirdrefeehily There's less supported bed places than there were a decade (or 2) ago. The religious charities upon which the state depended are gone. Disability supported living is the final Tuam Babies or Magdalena Laundries crime. People in responsible positions will be pensioned off. Y then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deirdrefeehily @JohPau That's because HSE and DoH have made a situation where parents don't trust that the service would meet their child's needs. Purposeful strategy by Health to push care away from state responsibility.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deirdrefeehily @JohPau Bloody hell D. What do you think us parents worry about the most? We would love to have planned transition, long before we pop our clogs. Problem is successive governments have let the problem get SO big, that why don't have the political will to fix it because of the cost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@byrneplan @JohPau Worse. Families and people with intellectual disabilities have been under provisioned for decades, and now the problem is too big to deal with because of the costs, so effectively ceasing service is the unspoken policy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohPau And even then, there is already an "Emergency" Crisis Waiting List of over 800 people.  With no planned transition people are dumped into first bed that gets "churned" when someone else dies.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@colettebrowne Maybe Senior #FineGael people don't want tasty consulting Jobs in ESB or Vodafone when they get unelected. Big Finance pays way better for Lobbyists.

<|startoftext|>@Deirdreveldon @IrishTimes It's the same strategy that @roinnslainte and @HSELive employ against Disability Inclusion Advocates.  String it out until parents die and then do minimum possible. Divide and conquer. Wait till media lose interest. Bully with Media resource and spin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No such options in Ireland, strangely since 2011. Parents have to die before Supported Living services provided by @HSELive  Ireland breaks Art.19 of #CRPD with impunity. @FineGael refusal to sign Optional Protocol allows discrimination.   https://t.co/a49DobfsbZ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SorchaWard1 @franklarkin18 @MarianHarkin Unfortunately a necessary evil. Especially for new candidates that aren't Big2 party whipped, and when there's no local media like in most of Dublin. Eyesore for a month every 5 years, but very recyclable and reusable.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SorchaWard1 @franklarkin18 @MarianHarkin Some people see a poster and think "who's s/he" and check their web or FB etc, which results in democracy. If you don't know who the candidates are, how do you make an informed decision? No local media = establishment only!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorJDolan @LeoVaradkar Have you noticed that @FineGael posters are "candidate shared"?  Is there a cash saving initiative because there might be an expensive General Election on the horizon?  Never mind the #LE19 , Ireland is a Centralised Power system.

<|startoftext|>@LeoVaradkar @FineGael @TedLeddy @emer_currie1 The #3mTaoiseach.  Isn't it a bugger when you are late to the "poles" and you have to flaunt the laws by going below 2.5m? Ah, sure power corrupts, and who's going to hold anyone in power to account in FG Ireland.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorJDolan Fair play John. Call a spade a spade. If @LeoVaradkar agreed to the #CRPD, even without the #OptionalProtocol, he should know what it's about. Heck, it's only 13% of the electorate, but it's not Corporationalism Lobbyists. #SpinOverLife.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Loving #LE19 #PosterWars.  Between #TidyTowns and #NewCandidates trying to get traction.  Then will @ESBNetworks enforce the rules on the Big2 parties?

<|startoftext|>@electionlit As #Dalkey #DunLaoghaire has almost NO local media (radio or press) this policy prevents people (Elderly and Disabled mostly) that don't use social media from seeing democratic alternatives.

<|startoftext|>@AddressingLife @McNiffecent @SimonHarrisTD Even though @FineGael were a party to #SlainteCare , they continue to pursue the principle of a privatised 2-Tier paid for Health Service. #JamesReilly did it and @RoisinShortall resigned on Principle.   We must be Out Of Principles if there are no resignations these days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@suzybie @LeoVaradkar @MichealMartinTD That's an issue of Ideology rather than administration. With fairness and equality in the mindset if the leading political majority, it would be the place. With the wrong ideology, it doesn't matter where disability sits. Will always be viewed as a non-equal section of community.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@suzybie As recommended by the Committee of the #CRPD, disability inclusion is cross ALL Government Departments, and should therefore be WITHIN the Department of The Prime Minister... An Taoiseach, whether it's @LeoVaradkar @MichealMartinTD or whoever holds the office.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adayinmywheels @cmcoughlan I'm with you there Sean. But we need to get past the personal silos and win:lose mentality foisted on us by a system that keeps us in competition for the scraps off the Masters table.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adayinmywheels @cmcoughlan Think this Tuesday will be at a seriously higher level. That's what happens when lived experience and advocacy push solutions rather than wanting to hear the same stories over and over again. #AltruismInIrishPolitics makes a nice change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DGLaity @cmcoughlan Not sure I fully understand. It's not a culture clash. It's a system clash designed by politics and administrators. Politically correct (or vote catching) to give to ageing / Retired community. So historically not considered disabled community.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@caulmick @CathMurphyTD When you "Count up" the public purse spend by Government into the Big 4, then Government can "Count on" the big 4 to not rock the boat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohPau @c_oreilly It's still transitioning disability supports to a for-profit private healthcare model. We know that is not sustainable during economic down-cycles.

<|startoftext|>@DonnellyStephen Split out several small sections of the HSE, like disability. Change their ToR to include Transparency and Accountability.  Reduce budget swirling. Increase efficiency. Increase Staff retention. Increase Value for money. When fixed, you can consider remerging.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonnellyStephen The National Treatment Purchase Fund is a continuation of the policy to privatise the health service.

<|startoftext|>@c_oreilly @mjamum So here's the reality.  State now provides what the child needs,  But spent a fortune on admin hours and legal fees,  To demonstrate to others "Not to ask for help".  It cost state an Extra fortune. Diverting critical resources away from Frontline.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aoifehegs @RTE_PrimeTime What a ridiculous way to administer.  "No funding"... Bad Press... "what colour would you like"?  Which other person then gets bumped down the list?  Why is it like this?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Conclusion 5 @SpNeedsParents AGM. Because #disability part of @HSELive, fixes to Hospitals Problem will always Rob resource from disability supports. Not Compatible with progressing disability equality out of the Dark Ages.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Conclusion 4 @SpNeedsParents AGM. Progressive Outcomes Focused disability support organisations offering alternatives to Isolationist Day-Service Warehousing are subjected to State Reprisals and services transferred to HSE-Buddies. Broken System more important than people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Conclusion 3 @SpNeedsParents AGM. Ireland's #Disability policies merely groping around in the dark while Part 2 of Disability Act 2005 is NOT Commenced. How can national planning be effective without statistics and data. Emphasis is on INPUTS, Not OUTCOMES. Overhaul Top-Down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Conclusion 2. @SpNeedsParents AGM. In Education or HSE Social Care Disability Staffing, should not be promotion or Transfers into #Disability Jobs from Non Disability Career Pathways. If "they" don't understand it, they do more harm than good. #separatefromHSE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Conclusion 1 @SpNeedsParents AGM : Ireland cannot provide #equality or Basic Dignity or delivery effective #Disability Outcomes while @HSELive is the coordinator.

<|startoftext|>@h0pefulmummy @c_oreilly @Carer49 So many complex issues can arise when Personal Budgets are treated as a means by state to transfer the Duty of Care, which combined with a delegation to a cherry picking private sector can leave a vacuum for the most vulnerable with inadequate funds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AddressingLife @c_oreilly The #CRPDOPTIONALPROTOCOL does not require ANY resources @campaignforleo.  It does the Complete Opposite of distracting focus from implementing the #CRPD.

<|startoftext|>@suzybie @nifhla @AddressingLife @fiannafailparty have another, more straightforward Motion in the queue.

<|startoftext|>@gavreilly Minister @SimonHarrisTD. Can we rely on you Not to oppose the Motion to #RATIFYCRPDoptionalprotocol?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FinianMcGrathTD No One could possibly NOT support Dail Motion to Ratify the #CRPDoptionalprotocol. Its NOT about Politics. It's better for ALL.  @sinnfeinireland @SocDems @labour @greenparty_ie @IndepAlliance @fiannafailparty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryJk64 A war has many battlefronts. All must be fought simultaneously, but you are wrong about the CRPD-op. That's the equivalent of the threat of The Hague or Nuremberg when the other side don't play fair.... And that's what we've got buddy.  So. How about me interviewing you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryJk64 Now we have something to talk about. When are you inviting me?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryJk64 That's not a true picture. Don't you have to do that now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryJk64 "Red Tape" and "BS", and you don't think getting access to Independent Monitoring and the Power to initiate Inquiry is ESSENTIAL to leverage change? Let's make someone responsible instead of spinning our wheels in a vacuum of Accountability Responsibility and Transparency.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryJk64 What are you seeking to change? What are your top 3 topics to be addressed? I'd love to chat about it. "We stand on the shoulders of giants".. Advocates that did their bit before us. We leave Ireland better than we found it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryJk64 I did. I do my research. I use multiple sources before concluding a position. As a person with disabilities, in a position to influence, you should be as diligent.

<|startoftext|>@GaryJk64 I did. Who said "after 1st report".. Same person made other promises. Any viable claim of rights infringement could take years.

This is why @FineGael will never sign the #CRPDOptionalProtocol. #DirtyLaundry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PearseDoherty @RTE_PrimeTime @PearseDoherty That's why @sinnfeinireland must not let campaign for #CRPDoptionalprotocol fail.  Disabled and #CarersInCrisis must have an Independent mechanism to hold these decision makers to account.  The Fox can't be allowed guard the Chicken Coop without oversight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RTE_PrimeTime @MiriamOCal Miriam. Do you understand now why @finegael government refused to sign the #CRPDOptionalProtocol.  Treat citizens like this, and prevent them from appealing to the UN Committee AT ALL COSTS.  State sponsored neglect of minority who can't "make work pay". #CRPD toothless under LEO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markmgr That's why @FineGael absolutely refused to sign the #CRPDOptionalProtocol. Carers and people with disabilities are just thought of as cast-offs, while Garda drive around in BMWs and Audis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeanadCEG @SenatorJDolan The rationale given is a complete slight of hand, treating the general public as though they are fools to be misled and distracted with spin. #FakeNews. Ratify the #CRPDoptionalprotocol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #PartyLine  "The Convention and the Optional Protocol cover a broad range of commitments some of which require substantive cultural change."

<|startoftext|>Reading @FinianMcGrathTD 's article in @Independent_ie yesterday, I think I know why #CRPDOptionalProtocol not signed.

<|startoftext|>@OCallaghanJim As main opposition spokesperson on Justice &amp; #Equality, and @MurphyOMahonyTD Spokesperson on #Disability are you using your positions to demand Ratification of the #CRPDOptionalProtocol ? or where does @fiannafailparty stand on this? Can we hear from you please.  https://t.co/zQWsT1W79a<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MurphyOMahonyTD @OCallaghanJim @MichealMartinTD  Are @fiannafailparty in agreement with Fine Gael about  Limiting and Restricting the Rights of People with Disabilities? or Are @fiannafailparty actively seeking the Government to ALSO sign the #CRPDOptionalProtocol  #NowOrNever  https://t.co/mZruKakeOT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@campaignforleo Met a bloke tonight from Scotland. Even he could tell me that the Irish Government are "piss poor" regarding disabilities. #evenforeignersknowirelandsucks Do it @campaignforleo. #CRPDoptionalprotocol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#COYBIG And you BLUES (@FineGael) too.  Ratify the #CRPDoptionalprotocol  https://t.co/rcrC1hxTjW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@desmond_kenny @GaryJk64 @FinianMcGrathTD "Temporary Absence"...  ... Like an 11 year "Temporary Absence" of the #CRPD?  You're old enough and bold enough to know...  Its now or never for #CRPDoptionalprotocol ratification.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@campaignforleo No harm in also ratifying the #UNCRPDOptional at same time, like 99% of EU Countries did.  #justsaying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CRPD #CRPDOptionalProtocol "Ireland has already ratified several Optional Protocols of this type including the third Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child in September 2014" by the Fine Gael led Government.  Not to do so for #Disability speaks Volumes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@22Q11_Ireland Now is the perfect opportunity for Government to show that People with Disabilities are Citizens like everyone else.  @finegael please sign the #CRPDOptionalProtocol   Why again be the Exception in EU? It IS Best Practice.  https://t.co/6LDPyQHtUR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"The #CRPD does not reinvent the wheel. It does not draw up or confer any new human rights. It makes plain that existing international human rights norms apply equally to persons with disabilities.‚Äù  Why @FineGael @simoncoveney would you NOT Ratify the #CRPDOptionalProtocol too?  https://t.co/xjGn30wjd7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Believe in #Equality ? When Trust is not there. When system is self-protecting and all-powerful.  @campaignforLeo &amp; @finegael Be the driver of positive societal inclusion.  Please be the Real Agent for Equality.  Please sign the #CRPDOptionalProtocol too. Leave a Positive Legacy.  https://t.co/7XXtHQUol2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FinianMcGrathTD @NCBI_sightloss #CRPDOptionalProtocol is non-negotiable. #UNCRPD needs genuine independent monitoring by Civil Society. Trying to prevent Citizens from accessing the UN Committee, like pretty much all other EU Citizens, is purely shameful of @finegael government.  https://t.co/g2QGeLARQy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryJk64 #CRPD implementation isn't an immediate on/off thing. It is a continuous process. Absolutely no reason why there should be a deluge of complaints. That's not quite how the #CRPDOptionalProtocol works. Who can give a good reason why Government wouldn't sign it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarlyBee25 Without the #CRPDOptionalProtocol people with disabilities will continue to be treated by the system like #MauriceMcCabe  People with Disabilities need an Independent Monitoring and Oversight option.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryJk64 What do you mean Gary?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaryLouMcDonald speech on #Repealthe8th about discrimination could equally apply to Ireland's culture towards people with disabilities.  That's why @FineGael should reconsider, and sign the #CRPDOptionalProtocol as well.  Independent Objectivity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the weekend that's in it.  The 640k Irish Citizens with a #Disability need @SocDems @sinnfeinireland @greenparty_ie  @labour @fiannafailparty @DisabilityFed @InclusionIre  to STAND #shouldertoshoulder to get CABINET to #ratifyuncrpd  OPTIONAL PROTOCOL #coybig üèà<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ratification of the #UNCRPD is actually pointless without the Optional Protocol.  I'm deeply concerned at how @finegael slyly removed OP.  #NoChange if no Independent Monitoring &amp; Complaints mechanism.  Medical Paternalistic Charity model will continue. #AbleHour @SenatorJDolan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SocDems @RoisinShortall It's @CharlieFlanagan that controls this brief. Finian is only a Junior Minister and was probably told to "put up and shut up" by his FG controllers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AddressingLife @GarNob @ProfoundIreland @FinianMcGrathTD So disappointing on so many levels. Disappointed that @FinianMcGrathTD wasn't man enough to admit it when asked directly. Disappointed that our @finegael Government effectively lied to society by setting expectations and then underhandedly leaving the OP out at last minute.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MMOC4U Dear Ms Mitchell O'Connor. Being our local TD Representative, could I kindly ask that you Publicly recommend to the Government that the Optional Protocol of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with a Disability be ALSO ratified #UNCRPD #CRPDOptionalProtocol  https://t.co/Mx2lNsbtek<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MariaBaileyFG As my local TD and a member of @FineGael, can you please tell me if it is still the intention of this @FineGael led Government to include the Optional Protocol of the #ratifyuncrpd CRPD #CRPDOptionalProtocol #OPCRPD in the Ratification?  https://t.co/JHK9XN5ksy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Government DID commit to accepting the #CRPDOptionalProtocol but seems to have changed their mind. @loreillysf @RoisinShortall @MurphyOMahonyTD @seansherlocktd @SenatorJDolan @paulmurphy_TD @Shane_RossTD @ClareDalyTD @EamonRyan  Could you please ask @CharlieFlanagan to confirm  https://t.co/7nWRfIC4P5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@suzybie @FinianMcGrathTD No!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CamphillFfa @FinianMcGrathTD "In addition, parties may permit the Committee to investigate, report on and make recommendations on "grave or systematic violations" of the Convention.[5]¬†Parties may opt out of this obligation on signature or ratification.[6]"  That's why. Ireland won't let UN look up its skirt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gavreilly @TonightShowTV3 "Parties agree to recognise the competence of the¬†Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities¬†to consider complaints from individuals or groups who claim their rights under the Convention have been violated"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gavreilly @TonightShowTV3 If you have a FG Panelist, could you please ask why Government wouldn't include Optional Protocol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @gavreilly @TonightShowTV3. Should you have taken a bet on this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NolimbsNolimits @DisabilityFed But Joanne, without the #CRPDOptionalProtocol you cannot make representation to the UN if "they" make more hills to climb. Policy Rich, Action Poor. You need NGOs and Citizens to be able to call them to account!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jocser99 @CarlyBee25 @RoisinShortall @FineGael Joe. Implementation will be like all other policies gathering dust if Government can't be called out by Civil Society. @SocDems need to fight for #CRPDOptionalProtocol BEFORE Ratification is sent into UN. Please make an issue of this From Tomorrow Morning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jocser99 @Jocser99 @RoisinShortall @CarlyBee25 Why would @FineGael Government not also Ratify the Optional Protocol of the #CRPD? Would you approve #VultureFunds to self report and self regulate? Why would they prevent NGOs and Citizens from lodging "observations" directly to the UNCRPD?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can @TonightShowTV3 @gavreilly please ask government Rep on show...  Will government also be Ratifying the Optional Protocol for the #UNCRPD, and if not....  WHY NOT?  @finianmcgrathtd refuses to answer!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think my Optional Protocol might be to invest in @OCallaghanCian campaign in Dublin Bay North. Stop faffing about Finian @FinianMcGrathTD and ANSWER THE QUESTION. Will #CRPDOptionalProtocol be included, and if not, WHO DECIDED NOT TO? This isn't going away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nikki_gavan @DisabilityFed It means the Government will NOT allow NGOs or Citizens to raise complaints regarding CRPD compliance with the UN.  Poacher policing the Poacher!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FinianMcGrathTD @FinianMcGrathTD Will Ratification include the Optional Protocol or not? Simple question Minister. Can we have a simple answer please?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_IHREC But what about the #CRPDOptionalProtocol?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NUIGCDLP @MOSullivanTD But it's no substitute for the Optional Protocol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simoncoveney could you give @FinianMcGrathTD a tap on the knee and tell him to confirm the Yee will be Ratifying the Optional Protocol. #ratifyuncrpd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's got to be at least 5 TDs that have asked you @FinianMcGrathTD to confirm that #CRPDOptionalProtocol will be Ratified at the same time as the #UNCRPD. #RATIFYCRPD   WELL? Can you please confirm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To borrow a famous Australian phrase. "Ya blaady buuuty" @RoisinShortall @SocDems knocked the #CRPDOptionalProtocol requirement right out of the park (yeah Baseball analogy). Great contribution. #ratifycrpd #irlratify #UNCRPD<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Where were you on the day President Kennedy was assassinated.... And Where were you when Ireland FINALLY agreed to Ratify the #CRPD #UNCRPD.  Historically small baby step to a fair and equal society.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TommyBroughanTD also asks that government sign the #CRPDOptionalProtocol. No good without it. #CRPD #irlratify<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well said @TommyBroughanTD. State must own up to the real extent of the shortfall. Commence Part 2 of Disability Act 2005 for a start. #UNCRPD #CRPD #irlratify #CRPDOptionalProtocol<|endoftext|>

Please don't let "them" avoid ALSO Ratifying the #CRPDOptionalProtocol.  Otherwise Civil Society can't raise matters with the UN.  Would you allow #VultureFunds to self-regulate and self-report. NO!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FinianMcGrathTD Hi Finian. We need the #CRPDOptionalProtocol ratified also. If not, it would be the equivalent of having #VultureFunds self monitoring and self reporting. Please don't waste this opportunity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eilionoirflynn But ONLY an option if Government ALSO ratify the OPTIONAL PROTOCOL #UNCRPD. Please ask your local TDs to make sure the #CRPDOptionalProtocol is ALSO accepted and ratified.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Lil2380 @CarersIreland @save_smota Think you took different interpretation from what was said. We don't have any large settings up here. Respite for high support has been in small dedicated units and it has worked very well (before it was butchered). Don't see how you took my description as conflicting! Choice!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lil2380 @CarersIreland @save_smota When a PwID has been totally reliant on being supported by parents in their house, you can't simply shock their lives and move them into an unfamiliar environment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lil2380 @CarersIreland @save_smota Center based respite is also a critical part of the transitioning process for people with Intellectual Disabilities to transition into Supported Living.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lil2380 @CarersIreland @save_smota There are many types of respite. Much depends on the levels of support needs of the individuals. For some, it may be nice to visit and stay with a Host Family. Others may prefer Care/Nursing staff to come into the family home. Others may prefer low supervision overnight with pals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lil2380 @CarersIreland @save_smota Not necessarily such a large place. Typically a 5 or so Bedroom ground floor living unit with appropriate staffing and equipment and activities to make a safe and enjoyable experience.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tescoshopper: A YES Equality campaign needed for disabled people in ROI says @TomClonan and isn't he right! @campaignforleo don't ignore us<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rteraydarcyshow @TomClonan #disabled people in Limbo. It's the responsibility of @campaignforleo and @SimonHarrisTD but they won't engage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good man Ray @rteraydarcyshow. You sound like you recognise the plight of disabled and carers... And WHY it's not addressed. @TomClonan  https://t.co/hrh9T6OGeg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Keep up the Great work @TomClonan #carersincrisis #ratifycrpd  https://t.co/hrh9T6OGeg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brennan_leo @mytaxi_ie I just uninstalled, but left feedback first. Wasn't as good as Hailo anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So. What reservations to #CRPD will @campaignforleo Govt slip in? Or is that why ratification will be kicked to next @fiannafailparty Govt?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jpquinn78 @mytaxi_ie So it's a booking fee. If taxi doesn't arrive in reasonable time &amp; take alternative transport, will fee auto refund?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When will you let us know about what #CRPD Reservations are being discussed in DoH DF and Cabinet? Surely it's public interest for debate?  https://t.co/IvO4M2ylML<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well done @suzybie and @TomClonan. #PKshow Authorative Advocacy Trumps bull and spin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here here!  https://t.co/IjUcF5fNtn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PKshow Good Advocacy from @suzybie and @TomClonan. @FinianMcGrathTD is tinkering around the edges. Tokenism. Get to the core of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CMDIRL @SamanthaELong @BoyhanVictor @SenatorJDolan Ha Ha lol. Would love to have seen that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@suzybie Cool. Will Deffo watch so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomClonan @thejournal_ie Tom, please please please don't limit your Advocacy to Physical Disability. Please represent all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@suzybie are u on with @TomClonan?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear @mytaxi_ie I will only levy a ‚Ç¨1 weekly rent for your app to take space on my device.  https://t.co/KedzhH1HqS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whocares4carers and aggregation of HSE "disability" spend away from Budget Silos into Outcomes focus with People at the Centre!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FinianMcGrathTD and concludes that State reliance on continued informal supports is unsustainable. Demographics and social units changed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@suzybie Terrible intro. Ivan &amp; Mick better with panel than 1on1.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ahh @colettebrowne Sure we're a great country for plans and reports. Implementation, delivery, outcomes, and responsibility. Not so much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@raggagirly Housing CAN be found, @hselive refuse to certify that support will be provided, except ultra-crisis cases (parent dies).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lynn2380 no. @hselive have "pegged" the number of Supported Living places to 1960 level and haven't accounted for population growth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@colettebrowne Unfortunately THAT is policy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WTF! @HSELive propose to send carer to house and send mum to B&amp;B. @RTE_PrimeTime #rtept That's the trend. Sit on Mammys couch and F-off.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>HB @CMDIRL he he.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CareAllianceIrl @GarNob Serious Question: is there a legal liability if parents leave Adult with complex needs alone and something happens?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarNob Irish Government refuse to commence Part 2 of 2005 Disability Act. No assessment of needs for anyone born before June 2002. Why?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@colettebrowne It's simple fear by politicians. Fear of unknown. Fear that it might cost ‚Ç¨ . Fear of being measured. Fear of change. Fear of responsibility<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AddressingLife PM'd you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AddressingLife Honestly, No.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4 days #Respite in November. #Lifesaver. Can't rely on @Ryanair though. What would happen if return flight cancelled?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good to see community at the heart of an Irish Political Party vision #ProjectMainStreet. National and Local. Good Initiative.  https://t.co/B5dQt6IIU4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great Initiative #ProjectMainStreet being driven by @SocDems. Nice to see fresh political movement with ambition to make change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is a reason why Ireland's government are the last country in EU to ratify #CRPD. Britain is heaven by comparison. @FinianMcGrathTD  https://t.co/PcY3vOuqLv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>May seem cruel to some, and "dumping" by YKW, but it's the only way a family unit can survive in difficult circumstances.  https://t.co/dMGZDBWYMr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nplawless yeah. Interesting question. Maybe ask @FinianMcGrathTD or @campaignforleo for guidance on it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@c_oreilly... W H Y? Closest thing Informal Carers have to Respite! Partial Escapism! and muscle relaxant for weary worn out bodies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@c_oreilly Only "Treat" in the house?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@c_oreilly Needed a Sugar Hit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ginagrant72 @AddressingLife that then begs questions of Guardianship, Human Rights of Informal Carers, and State obligations to citizens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Q: Is it illegal or immoral to leave a non-mobile non-verbal Profoundly Intellectually Disabled adult ALONE for a few hours or overnight?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mjamum @IrishTimes @irishexaminer @Independent_ie @oconnellbrian It's the entire Complex Needs community that needs voices to be heard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do #Homeless figures include 9,000+ Intellectually Disabled Adults @PMVTrust @FocusIreland @Dublin_Simon @HSHIreland Please Include All  https://t.co/Zwxb3dHT21<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>51% of ADULTS with Intellectual #Disability in Ireland = #Homeless. @DisabilityFed @CarersIreland @Paschald @SimonHarrisTD @dghealthservice  https://t.co/vn4FH0qsOz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@suzybie I'd really appreciate inclusion in that as a rep of people with S/P ID / High Support Needs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@suzybie. Heard about a Housing meeting. That's my area of interest. Any details?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurenceTheBird or "don't do", which is more the Irish system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SocDems @CathMurphyTD The plans lack "accountability"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>we can create NAMA ignoring legislative processes, to stop a Bank crisis but refuse to do the same for our citizens¬†  https://t.co/YoIq0KVOJ7<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@1KenCampbell Equality &amp; Rights preferably.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Role title seems is a bit of an oxymoron alright.  https://t.co/EU18Og1c6E<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomClonan @fiannafailparty @sinnfeinireland @greenparty_ie @SocDems @campaignforleo Interesting line in #GameOfThrones "The Lion cares not for the concerns of the sheep". Familiar in Irish implementation of Disability policy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marybuckley549 @TomClonan @RBoydBarrett @MariaBaileyFG @mitchelloconnor Would require a departure from precedent. Doesn't "do" Disability.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marybuckley549 @TomClonan @RBoydBarrett @MariaBaileyFG @mitchelloconnor Ha Ha Ha. Rainy day in Hell before @mitchelloconnor seeks outcomes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would @tusla or @hselive approve an invalid or someone with depression as a Foster Carer? So why do they ignore people "dumped" on family?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Political cherry-picking of evidence has become worse than sweeping issues under the carpet. @TomClonan  https://t.co/M0wItbbsuQ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump holy God. Take credit for Obamas initiative, and even though no money spent, claim 000's nukes upgraded in 6mths. Fool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@suzybie have done some research on this. Why is the important question. No Trust in State to ring-fence appropriate service (PwID)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't think "prevent" is the word I'd use. Many don't see it as viable due to lack of PA and Care budgets and no responsibility by hse.  https://t.co/dcX2KfvwC3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceODonnell10 @rte @DisabilityFed @wicklowcoco only the tip of the iceberg. Most are NOT on list because don't trust HSE to provide care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would love to, but 95 quid is a bit beyond people with disabilities or carers on poverty support. Pity stakeholders can't contribute.  https://t.co/hH0rXhZgca<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@fiannafailparty If you were leading next Govt, who would be appointed as Minister for Disabilities? #AskFiannaFail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fiannafailparty Will you fully commence the Disability Act 2005 and amend to include Rights #AskFiannaFail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great Idea, and in line with "making work pay" and "employment of PwD" Govt policies. So you too "can get up early in the morning"!  https://t.co/mliknLFYsm<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@blissinthebog before you make final decision, check what HAP rate you will get in KK. Suspect same problem, different location.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4 what it's worth, @mitchelloconnor and @EamonGilmore were told that HSE Cuts were compromising Frontline Service care at SJOG Carmona<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow Vincent. That's a good start to #vinb. I'll have to stay up now to hear the politicians hating the idea. It's got merit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CillianGartlan @SocDems @1GaryGannon historically Ireland doesn't get much BANG for its Buck. Increase the Bang but stop reducing the Buck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @dlrcc, there's a worthwhile challenge. Bet, with input from the DCG, we could mount a serious campaign for this.  https://t.co/zD4LC3ljM9<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Public transport policy in action.  https://t.co/HYrUM1hoEs<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_IHREC @irishexaminer Hope you raise CRPD and over reliance on informal supports for People with Disabilities.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FinianMcGrathTD Being so Inter-departmental, I guess that's why the #CRPD recommends that Disability be under Dept. Of Prime Minister.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aoiph @Helenaclose And women are equally represented in the disability community.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JanOSullivanTD @sarahlennon08 Maybe there should be quotas for people with disabilities in the Dail and Front Bench too?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Labour weren't strong enough Vs #finegael last time. #ireland needs more equal coalition. @SocDems + #Labour to rein in #finegael #ge16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do senior politicians not use the Public System like everyone else? RT @TJ_Politics: The 5 (cont)  https://t.co/wM0UWgVniP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cop-on! Right wing #finegael underinvestment in society leads to more crime, bitterness, social division, anger. #ge16 CAUTION!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@suzybie Puppet or Muppet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, who would you prefer to be #MinisterForDisability after #GE16? Can't see any real candidate that would fix the damage done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will that include ID @KathleenLynchTD, or is it just populist general population votes?  https://t.co/NfL6dsSdU2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well explained @katemarcella. #disableinequality #cblive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope Leo will be staying on @CB_Live For the #disableinequality Discussion. Don't forget people with Extensive Support needs - profound ID.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pity no @SocDems candidate in #dunlaoghaire to take on #dlfg spin and canned sales pitch.  https://t.co/F5K8M5I78R<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Could have launched 2yrs ago. Why only now #GE16. We see thru you!  https://t.co/RAR8h3w9kv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Present this at #fgaf16 The cost of caring. The cost of not caring.  https://t.co/dEGCv8C6pK via @wordpressdotcom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kind of says what @FineGael and @labour really think of Disability. You don't work....die quietly!  https://t.co/AT2xBI1GJv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While involuntary family carers are consigned to free market poverty.   https://t.co/hRKT6CE5H9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @FineGael want a USA style society for #GE16. Crime, Obesity, Poverty.   https://t.co/SafDUnqNYk @SocDems offer the best honest balance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listening to radio today and heard that @KathleenLynchTD had considered NOT running in #GE16. Best news ever. Hope it's true. Useless!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time to emigrate from this Banana Republic!  https://t.co/7xhSrdGsRW<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#restorerespitecare I found  http://t.co/2o7qutIEnh and it seems like a different language when you compare to #Ireland @HSElive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still reeling from that @FineGael #budget2015. Disabled community now officially non-priority. #RestoreRespiteCare  http://t.co/bSQnTCR3s6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha Ha. Couldn't resist sharing  http://t.co/Mru7BKw9 #Respite Care Cuts to #caregivers will come back to haunt #labour and #finegael.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Labour better reconsider the #Respite Care Cuts or face a fate like the Green Party. #caregivers are essential and have needs too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Adopt a Profoundly Disabled Child? Apply to #HSE after Respite Cutbacks &amp; families can't cope and fall foul of #crref. #labourparty<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ghook Let's have Calorie Burning Counts for the walk to the dole office.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheWillinator No. These shower know we cant fuck them out for NOT doing what we elected them to do #vinb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RT @mmclou: #vinb occupy The Six Counties... and then sell it to the Israelis or the yanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marquisdecusack have one already, but thanks for the offer anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jimmyendless Good analogy... but dont confuse us with Pillow Biters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vincent #vinb would you get @davidmcw on the program to discuss his recent article about european mathematics not working for #ireland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>fair play to #vinb giving the protest some objective airtime. We're not all sheep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A bad deal for Ireland and a bad deal for Europe. Fantastic article by @davidmcwilliams  http://t.co/IAo84zHp #vinb #budget2012 #rtept<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tired of this #budget2012 #vinb shit now. Need smart caring people in politics but parents of #disabled people dont have the time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#vinb if WE pay morons like Hayes so much, how can we expect them to be grounded and understanding reality of life? Demand pay cuts!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RT @quiatimet: Hopefully someone is giving Hayes a good slap for that performance - horrendous! #vinb #finegael<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#vinb yer man @brianhayes is an idiot. #FG need to sort out their communications or the #shinners will gain big time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally someone with a point, and she doesn't need a satnav to find the mansions. #vinb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#vinb Vincent. Lay into them about bullying the #disabled. Just cruel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha Ha lol RT @SeanFitzAnglo: #Budget2012 contact me now if anyone is looking for financial advice...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If someone shoots that bastard #bertie, can his pension be bequethed to the Special Needs community? #budget2012<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will #fg and #labour revert to calling the #disabled Spastics? Leave them at home and bankrupt their carer families? #rtept #budget2012<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RT @DearbhlaCarmody: #rtept so because the gov did not have the courage to revisit croke park, people with disabilities suffer.  #budget2012<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does Noonan think Down Syndrome is the only Intellectual Disability? Has he heard of PROFOUND? #rtept #budget2012 #disabilities FOOL!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So who is the Disabilities Hater? Noonan, Howlin or Burton? Tell all the lies you like, you bullied people that dont hit back #rtept<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does Minister Noonan know any people who are not Farmers or in the Tourism industry? Get out more. #rtept<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@liamooo no. Because @fiannafail bought our sheeplike votes by cutting taxes too much and fueling the false bubble economy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EFFanning .no. just think the poor feckers need a chance. Id hate the job they have to do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#rtefl judging by tweets, @sinnfein have an army of electronic soldiers fighting the cause on twitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#rtefl Marylou is just "politicing". Shinners just make noise. Dont have any realistic solid solutions. Just Rhetoric and opposition crap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarraghMcH #FG and #labour didn't cause this. @Bertie and #FF did.  Like it or not, the current govt would much rather be popular too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because we Irish seem to like the smell of the crap they promise RT @JamesGall13: FF, FG and Labour are all a shower of wankers. #Budget2012<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RT @FrankByrneD6W: The cut in child benefit is a step in the right direction .. through #FG bottled out of meaningful reform #budget2012<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reducing Redundancy rebates will only save that much IF #FG expect the same number of people to be laid-off in 2012. Bit fatalistic??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, that was when we voted for #FF RT @DarraghMcH: don't get why people are complaining. this is what you voted for #budget2012<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#budget2012 Lots of negative comments, but failing the option of scrapping the system alltogether, who has any better ideas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RT @valmullally: Not far off practice for #budget2012 so. Sitting in candlelight. Power cut. At least I have gas hob.<|endoftext|>
