<|startoftext|>@sa55m55a @cowboyangels @realDonaldTrump To you “doing your research” means read conspiracies and websites that confirm my thoughts and watch YouTube videos made by amateurs trying to get views. No thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickleprick1 @cowboyangels @realDonaldTrump “Do your research”😂 you think doing your research means watching YouTube videos and reading conspiracies that validate your thoughts. You shouldn’t be criticizing others. Also, people are still meeting others in private places W/O masks so...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Deplorables_Inc @cowboyangels @realDonaldTrump People keep meeting in non public places without a mask you fool. 2) I assure you many aren’t wearing them in public as well or are wearing them incorrectly as well 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Carpophores @meegra2 @KylaInTheBurgh You must be talking to yourself<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Dusanc22 More people voted against Trump in both elections. Perhaps you should move to Russia or North Korea. Trump LOVES dictators. Apparently you do too.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ffotag1017 @ChuckCallesto @realDonaldTrump You are on the losing side. Even IF Trump were able to pull off this stunt, it would be through lying, conning and cheating.

<|startoftext|>@Chellaney Yes and our country was safer because of it. This is the mess Republicans started let you forget<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Republicans are cheats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamVTV @tnridge @realDonaldTrump Not sure if you know this but Trump was broke before (owed lots of money to foreign governments). He was being investigated for tax fraud. He’s gained a lot from being president. Don’t act like he’s a victim. He’s no victim.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tnridge @athamrick @KamVTV @ShelleyLuther Spoken like a true Trump supporter. Thanks for helping me make my point. Such hypocrites<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#signthepapers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheNYSocialist At least he was transparent about it. Trump reversed the order so that he could drone the hell out of places but didn’t have to report. Trump doesn’t believe in accountability for himself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@USNAviationMech I could say the same for you.😬it’s so sad. I am not pro Antifa, I just think your inability to see that the extreme right is just as bad (if not worse) is hypocritical, intolerant, Unpatriotic, ignorant and very much a sign of brainwashing by #Cult45<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@USNAviationMech Yes, it’s been around but he certainly popularized it in the US in regards to Trump’s propaganda. FYI Whataboutism is particularly associated with Soviet and Russian propaganda. Which is why it’s accociated with Trumpism and his puppets(AKA you) 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@USNAviationMech It’s not projection if it actually applies to you😂 pick up a book.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@USNAviationMech Hahahahaha, what about is a John Oliver term. Absolutely clueless aren’t you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@USNAviationMech @TANKSTER_NYC @ElijahSchaffer You can’t even think for yourself😂 it’s not hard to look up information using reliable sources, you should have learned that in Elementary school. So sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@USNAviationMech @TANKSTER_NYC @ElijahSchaffer QAnon and KKK (AKA Trump supporters) are literally on the domestic terrorist list😂 you are so brainwashed #Cult45<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@USNAviationMech @TANKSTER_NYC @ElijahSchaffer Have you ever bothered to look up the history of Antifa? 😂🙄you can’t just make up stuff cause it sounds good to you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@USNAviationMech @TANKSTER_NYC @ElijahSchaffer Antifa literally stands for Anti-Fascist. Like that’s how the name came about😂. Do you always just make up stuff and try to pass it as fact? I feel like you would have to in order to still be a Trump worshipper<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@USNAviationMech @TANKSTER_NYC @ElijahSchaffer Wow, such anger. You should get help for that before you commit a crime like some other Trump supporters already have. Like Kyle Rittenhouse for one. Also, I’ve seen some of your “video” proof. It’s always out of context when you research it😘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PEBBLES_GRAY @KamVTV @ShelleyLuther There is this thing called data, reliability and validity. You should look it up. Maybe take a statistics class or even a science class, might do you some good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikegrant121 @CarlosPenaGar10 @KamVTV @ShelleyLuther “When conservatives truly become what you Falsely claim it’s not going to be pretty.” That’s some lazy gaslighting there. You’ll have to try harder. Also, any sane person knows you’re the one projecting here. Are you too lazy to look up info as well?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PEBBLES_GRAY @KamVTV @ShelleyLuther I guarantee the news has more factual information than the you tube videos or Alt media you get your conspiracies from.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikegrant121 @CarlosPenaGar10 @KamVTV @ShelleyLuther As I stated, trump supporters already are shooting, killing, threatening (as you just did), stabbing, attempting to kidnap and running over people with cars because they hate anti-fascist rioting (destroying property) against fascism. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewPollackFL @realDonaldTrump I’m sure the Nazis felt this way as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorLoeffler This is a great scripture. Now are you going to confess, start doing the right thing and stop being a hypocrite?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IAmDawnM We should all do the same 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikegrant121 @CarlosPenaGar10 @KamVTV @ShelleyLuther Voices in your head. Gotcha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@j_a_bristol I sounds like a different perspective could do you some good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikegrant121 @CarlosPenaGar10 @KamVTV @ShelleyLuther Please enlighten me with your sources then? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillOReilly You mean like what Trump is doing to Biden now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikegrant121 @CarlosPenaGar10 @KamVTV @ShelleyLuther You obviously didn’t look it up🙄 continuing to believe conspiracies on You Tube and historically unreliable media sites/shows is extremely unpatriotic and detrimental to our society. Wake up. Learn how to do research correctly. Use facts, not conspiracies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan It wasn’t baseless, didn’t you read the senate report?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillOReilly Well, first came an action and then a reaction But you can't switch around for your own satisfaction Well, you burnt my house down and got mad at my reaction<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillOReilly Obama had the same attacks early on but Obama didn’t fan the flames like Trump did<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angelikachkaa @ElijahSchaffer Maybe because your video was proven to be a lie. Someone needs to start holding those that spread these lies accountable, as in you shouldn’t have a platform to spread hate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PEBBLES_GRAY @KamVTV @ShelleyLuther Y’alls idea of facts usually consists of a group of conspiracies you either heard from some right wing show with a low reliability rating or you tube videos made by strangers. You should take something for that paranoia/neuroticism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikegrant121 @CarlosPenaGar10 @KamVTV @ShelleyLuther Time for you to wake up and see all the violence going on in Trump’s name. Look it up, those groups (AKA Trump supporters) are indeed stabbing, shooting and running over people with their cars. Denying it doesn’t make it go away. Just makes you ignorant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TANKSTER_NYC @ElijahSchaffer Yeah, your use of a video that show violence with no context or proof of who committed it just proves my point.  Your use of profanity even more so. For all I know, that’s you in the video using the N word. You guys are associated with the KKK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@USNAviationMech @TANKSTER_NYC @ElijahSchaffer You guys are terrified of Antifa for rioting (and destroy property) against fascism. Yet it’s you that actively engages and fantasizes about violence on people. Shooting , stabbing, running over people with cars have all been done in Trump’s name.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@123RMAGA1 @KamVTV @ShelleyLuther oh wow, now everyone knows where you live. Very smart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@veninediveci @KamVTV @KaraMar111 @ShelleyLuther @realDonaldTrump Antifa hurts buildings.

It’s time for a reality check @veninediveci<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MigdalEder12 @KamVTV @Cajunhearted4 @ShelleyLuther Trump supporters are such violent people. Always talking about shooting people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TexTerri @MercerCreed @KamVTV @ShelleyLuther Let me guess, you saw a YouTube video of a guy explaining the “math” behind the conspiracy 😂😂😂 someone so easily fooled shouldn’t go around calling people stupid.<|endoftext|>

Look it up. 2) What he has built is far from what he promised at the start of his 2016 election campaign, when he pledged to build a concrete wall along the border's entire 2,000-mile length.3) Mexico didn’t pay😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThePatriotsMGS @KamVTV @Tinsley2Ns @ShelleyLuther Spoken like a true Trump supporter; always ready for violence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@athamrick @KamVTV @ShelleyLuther Antifa hurts buildings. Right wing militias/ proud boys/kkk (AKA Trump supporters) kill people, run over people with cars, stab people and threaten people with guns. Time for a reality check Andy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikegrant121 @CarlosPenaGar10 @KamVTV @ShelleyLuther “Peaceful group”is he referring to the proud boys, kkk, right wing militias? You know, the ones that hurt/kill/ run over people with their cars? Time for a reality check Mike<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PEBBLES_GRAY @KamVTV @ShelleyLuther The fact that you believe Trump at his word (a man who has been caught in so many lies) despite no real evidence tells me you are the brainwashed. Stop projecting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So dumb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mike28691705 @KamVTV @ShelleyLuther You don’t care for Shelley because you are probably a misogynist Proud Boy. Also, it’s cute that you call him “my Trump”<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DanSilvestro @w_terrence We saw how bad it was when the Republicans were running the senate under Obama. I don’t think Trump exposed anything except for the amount of hate and distrust people have. Those that didn’t see it before still don’t see it. And Vice versa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanSilvestro @w_terrence Obama was great for sure.A lot of people saying Bernie should have won are those who don’t really understand the makeup of the country and electoral college. It would be great to have a more progressive candidate but we are in survival mode and need to build<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RudyGiuliani Is this according to the blind computer guy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Exactly what the president has been saying? Who wrote this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanSilvestro @w_terrence Americans aren’t fighting Trump and Republicans, we are fighting against hate and ignorance. I don’t think social media is giving you the full picture.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sierradedorado7 @MSNBC The press is using this concept called “counting ballots”. Apparently it’s a secret technique that’s been happening for over 200 years in America. I’m glad Trump finally exposed it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samstein @lachlan You can always count on Trump doing the exact same ting he’s accusing other of.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrDenaGrayson When the election is over we need to have a serious discussion/reflection about all of the violent acts and deaths(Including Corona) that have happened in the name of Trumpism.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@w_terrence These people are nothing without Trump and are desperately trying to keep themselves relevant even if it means putting our democracy at risk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When all of this is done we should reflect upon all of those that have died in the name of Trump. Shootings, violent acts and Covid deaths.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JamesDitto12 @allrightblog @DPekelder @RealJamesWoods I was just telling someone earlier that I believe Dems over Trump de many reasons, but one of the clinching reasons is that you guys just regurgitate what is being said about you.

<|startoftext|>@ZQZQue @TheEconomist Maybe you should write them and ask them? Or look it up on their website.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@allrightblog @DPekelder @RealJamesWoods Don’t  get me wrong, I’m constantly looking up information I hear/read from the media as well. They aren’t innocent. I’m just pointing out that Trump depends on you not trusting anyone but him so that he can survive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@allrightblog @DPekelder @RealJamesWoods Except I keep looking up his claims and keep finding them to be gross exaggerations or flat out lies/conspiracies.Im not even talking about the gaslighting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricRecla @shanateitel2017 @DPekelder @RealJamesWoods I’m smart enough to know what’s truth and what isn’t. I know where to find data, reliable sources and question without taking conspiracies as fact. Trump admits to lying to you, but you justify it as okay. Why is that?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SteveDeaceShow I stayed up all night, trust me, no magic was involved z🙄they were counting all night<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPekelder @RealJamesWoods You can’t trust it because Trump has spent the last 5 years trying to get you to distrust everything. He admitted it in television<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Waiting4suns @pokerspudda @NomikiKonst To make it more clear, it’s the Fox watching, QAnon conservatives you have to win over. They are half the voters. With Gerrymandering and those guys you have no chance of getting anything done. Put your energy in winning them over. Dems are on your side🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Waiting4suns @pokerspudda @NomikiKonst You have to convince those that are brainwashed to believe democratic socialism is evil that it’s not. You won’t do that by shouting and whining at Democrats for not getting your way. Get the F out there and convince people why you’re right. Stop whining<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Waiting4suns @pokerspudda @NomikiKonst My point is that whining on twitter isn’t going to accomplish crap when you have a country full of people believing propaganda. You guys are 1) fighting the wrong people 2) creating more division<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Waiting4suns @pokerspudda @NomikiKonst You’re laughing but all you did was prove my point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cfahooligan @GretelGammache @DrDooleyMD I said record wise, not personality or appeal. I don’t expect any group that associates themselves as someone’s “bros” or “boys” to favor thebwoman😏Look it up.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Avery_Madison @LeftyyLeftyy Those are also places where they are still counting democrat city early votes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Avery_Madison @LeftyyLeftyy He’s highly favored in Wisconsin. If he holds ground in Nevada he only needs one more state. He’s currently.3 away in Michigan and most of those votes are mail ins from Dem counties. He’s also so close in Georgia and not too far in Pennsylvania<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarroM85 @KennyMcITR Julian Castro was saying the same. I think they all knew<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KennyMcITR @JulianCastro predicted the same! Why aren’t we praising him as well?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeftyyLeftyy Joe is going to win the exact way he calculated he would win. He surrounds himself with smart people and listens to them😀 looks like Democrats might have been right to pick him!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GretelGammache @DrDooleyMD Personally, I think she was a way better candidate record wise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tmanfitz @DrDooleyMD FYI there were more effective and just as (if not more) progressive candidates in the Dem ticket during the primaries, but you guys are so focused on the one that shouts at people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldMBraden @Brasilmagic @DrDooleyMD What’s stupid is pretending gerrymandering and voter suppression doesn’t exist. What’s stupid is forgetting that about half the country consists of conservatives; many of whom believe democratic socialism is evil. Get off your idealistic high horse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Leney_3 @DrDooleyMD Yes! I wish they would move on. He wasn’t even the most progressive or effective senator that ran 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HogwartsPadfoot @DrDooleyMD You guys act like the whole country is compromised of democrats🤦🏻‍♀️ You forget the Fox viewing QAnoners who have been brainwashed. You forget that gerrymandering exists. Stop whining and start getting conservatives to see democratic socialism isn’t scary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrDooleyMD Blame misinformation, gerrymandering and the fear mongering propaganda that is keeping America from progressing. Stop focusing on the part that will be easy to change. Whining isn’t going to turn half the country that thinks democratic socialism is evil 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrandonJeremia7 @David_Lally @dmenkens @ProudSocialist @DNC @BernieSanders No, if he had sky high favorables he would have won the primary not struggled with Buttigieg then Biden.

<|startoftext|>@fly_dive @Styx666Official The only reason mail in ballots hadn’t been counted was because of a stupid GoP law in these states that makes them wait till election day🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jennmac415 🤣🤣🤣Awe you assumed I was a man when you were pointing out sexism.🤣 I’m not. Bless your heart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shadaofallthing @kazloren @ProjectLincoln I’ll put it in a better way, I actually am part of organizations that help the LGBTQI community. What do you do besides threaten violence and whine on Twitter?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shadaofallthing @kazloren @ProjectLincoln And get off Q. It’s obviously being fed by Trump. The guy who pretty much admitted on television that he’s purposefully trying to discredit the media to get people to doubt it so that he’ll look better🙄 wake up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shadaofallthing @kazloren @ProjectLincoln It’s this type of language that will never convince anyone if anything. Idk what your point is honestly. You just sound like someone who wants to whine about everything. Seek help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shadaofallthing @kazloren @ProjectLincoln You fantasize  a civil war just like all the other Trump supporters. It’s sick. Republicans weren’t the ones that legalized gay marriage or LGBT in military, they are threatening it. You’re right we have to do more, voting Dem is the first start.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RayFormica @SexyRexysMom @Project_Veritas @JoeBiden Project Veritas tried the exact same pseudo investigating during the last election🙄 I agree, but pulled that wording from Media Bias/Fact Check, whom I find to be pretty straightforward<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shadaofallthing @kazloren @ProjectLincoln 🙄They put facts on paper. It’s more accomplishment than your whining. I mean this in the sincerest ways, you need to be talking to a therapist about your views; not Twitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bryanth2o Maybe he meant Captain Moron<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SexyRexysMom @RayFormica @Project_Veritas @JoeBiden Overall, Project Veritas is borderline Questionable Right Biased based on story selection that only favors the right and Mixed for factual reporting due to lack of sourcing and several failed fact checks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@geracechris @Project_Veritas @JoeBiden @jack Did it ever occur to you it’s because the crap you guys post are lies? The president himself admitted to discrediting the media for selfish purposes. It makes people like you doubt the bad facts about him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jennmac415 @Project_Veritas @JoeBiden When there is actual evidence this is true. It’s in a red state sweetie, if it’s real it’ll be exposed🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cheesec21525168 @Project_Veritas Voter suppression,gerrymandering, and now getting people to believe election is compromised unless Trump wins are all tactics Republicans use. Make no mistake, look at the  https://t.co/R28MEQ6WWL. Trump admitted to discrediting MSN for selfish purposes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PattyAndrade19 @Project_Veritas @JoeBiden Actually, that’s how Republicans have won. Look it up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vickie1757 @Project_Veritas @BledsoeChuck @JoeBiden How do you think democrats feel?We’ve tried to fight voter suppression/other Republican tactics for years! Look up the history. Eye opening. Look at what Bush did in Florida, they are setting it up to happen again this  https://t.co/Z2NXkaT7LJ’s all a setup.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@howsyour401k @NiceDeb @Project_Veritas @JoeBiden This video is about as convincing as the whole Hunter Biden shenanigans 😂🤣😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timwebb730 @Project_Veritas @JoeBiden You guys are CONSTANTLY threatening violence, and yet you have the audacity to criticize Antifa for looting🙄 it’s so hypocritical<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera @POTUS The whole Hunter Biden hoopla reminds me of another charade in the 80’s involving a certain Capone’s vault.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shadaofallthing @kazloren @ProjectLincoln We were advancing during the Obama years.Trump’s new Supreme Court Justice will put us back.That’s why we have to get these bigots out.That’s the first step. Whining on Twitter and threatening violent revolts is more detrimental.   https://t.co/PBWbRotJEP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WICKEDBWNY We have to make sure Trumpism goes away for good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AP So, I have no idea who this guy is. Pretty much anonymous to me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shadaofallthing @ProjectLincoln You sound spoiled. You have to work at getting conservatives and religious people to agree with you. They are about half the country. Learn how government works before you start threatening revolts and convincing people to stay away from the best candidate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shadaofallthing @ProjectLincoln First, you’re the one baiting  https://t.co/2pPD95ZCpJ this point,a vote 4 Biden/dems =progress. If you can’t see that 4 more years of Trump will tear down the progress we’ve made in many areas I don’t know what to say except get off your high horse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shadaofallthing @ProjectLincoln They are the only ones that have done anything🙄 you have this all or nothing mentality. That’s not how things get done. You have to work for things, can’t have them handed to you on a silver platter🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shadaofallthing @ProjectLincoln Then stop your whining and do something productive ! Complaining about the Democrats (the party that has any chance of doing anything environmentally or lgbtqi wise) right before the election is only helping Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shadaofallthing @ProjectLincoln What point are you trying to make? Are you wanting people to vote for Trump? Because whining about Dems right before an election because they haven’t met your ideals is not accomplishing anything. Vote the pres,senate and house closest to your ideals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gtconway3d It better be good, and now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@swatsler @greg_price11 You guys are so brainwashed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TonyShnark Yes! Sexist pig<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shadaofallthing @ProjectLincoln Which party has gotten the most done in regards to LGBTQI? Which party speaks hate against LGBTQI??? Which party just nominated a SCJ that has an ultra conservative last? It’s not rocket science.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@astaley121 @kittykattweet06 @RyanHobbsMMA @Benaskren Who is “they”?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shadaofallthing @ProjectLincoln You vote in Congress and Senate to make the policies, Biden signs them. You can forget about progressive policies with Trump. Biden was also highly responsible for passing gay marriage. So there’s that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Benaskren Until you start looking at how many incorrect statements he’s made. I could probably start making crap up and get as much right as he does. Even more so if I can make you believe my conspiracies are true.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JonnyO11571105 @realDonaldTrump Biden’s platform focuses on college affordability and the student debt crisis,. Trump’s doesn’t<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonnyO11571105 @realDonaldTrump Now let’s talk about education. I think public schools need more funding not less, which is what is being seen with Trump. Charter schools should not take public school funding.  Trump rolled back Obama policies, such as Title IX sexual misconduct policies.🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonnyO11571105 @realDonaldTrump Or how he pretty much bullied states to open up too quickly and leaving us with one of the highest death/hospitalization rates.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonnyO11571105 @realDonaldTrump Maybe talk about Corona. Like how I agree with Fauci and scientific studies, or how Trump did sound like he purposely was underplaying the virus. People are still arguing about masks. He got treatment the majority of us don’t or won’t. And isn’t sympathetic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonnyO11571105 @realDonaldTrump I can keep going, this is fun<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonnyO11571105 @realDonaldTrump Trump has had over 20 sexual misconduct/harassment/rape cases, who does trump owe all that money to, trump is the least transparent president in my time, trump has undone the transparency Obama created with drones in Afghanistan, trump no longer keeps records<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonnyO11571105 @realDonaldTrump Other countries now have less faith in America, Biden is a moderate, I like Biden’s immigration policies better, I think Trump was a little too close to Epstein so don’t think he should be president while Ghislaine is on trial...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonnyO11571105 @realDonaldTrump The trade Deficit balance got Worse under Trump, the trade wars weren’t as beneficial (same with his tax cuts), I don’t like how he bullies people or how erratic his admin is(so many going to jail, not stable), I want stronger alliances with our allies...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonnyO11571105 @realDonaldTrump Hasn’t done much for women, his justice reform bill was good But unemployment gains were better under Obama for blacks, Obama also out in systematic programs to help both Hispanics and blacks Trump hasn’t, I want to see ACA improved upon...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonnyO11571105 @realDonaldTrump No real healthcare plan, his tax reform actually hurt me, deficit is outta control and he’s making it worse, don’t like his rhetoric and he’s got victim mentality,he’s been caught lying or making misleading statements over 25,000 times...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonnyO11571105 @realDonaldTrump Bigger economic gains under Obama (look up gains), presidents who have gotten us out of recessions/depressions have been Democrats. I don’t like a lot of Trump’s policy moves in regards to environment and lgbtqi. His foreign policy is erratic...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonnyO11571105 @realDonaldTrump This might be the dumbest reason against socialism I’ve ever read🤣 anyhow, democratic socialism isn’t what you think it is.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Dingaling1111 @CaslerNoel @unfuck_america @realDonaldTrump They refuse to look at it. Will just keep going back to the Clintons. It’s weird. Some try to talk about how Trump Kicked Epstein out of club and think that’s enough. I tell them he probably did that for optics because a VIP was complaining at club.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealRLimbaugh @realDonaldTrump I don’t think the words Donald Trump and “uplifting “ belong together. The only possible scenario might be when he’s talking about national terrorists that support him.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HoelandsMokena @TeamBiden2 And the only math that will make a statement in this election is the electoral count and popular vote. Biden needs both. He has to make a statement. That’s why a “vote green” on a Biden post is upsetting.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HoelandsMokena @TeamBiden2 Did you even read it? It talks about how a vote for a party that won’t win is a wasted vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HoelandsMokena @TeamBiden2 The only one “wrong on all accounts is you”. Biden needs every vote. FYI green falls into #1 , so your argument validates my Original theory about why you are telling people to vote green in this thread<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cadenbrackett @cdotmom @realDonaldTrump And Putin. Putin loves trump. I guess you could say Trump LIVES Putin as well. Trump also if fond of dictators. He wants to be one you know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cadenbrackett @cdotmom @realDonaldTrump It’s actually listed as a terrorist group soooo...but I heard terrorist groups are endorsing trump now.

<|startoftext|>@KennethMurwanto @HKrassenstein @MittRomney Wow, I’m not surprised. Don the con has a way of making this happen. And the fact that you say”kneel down” and laugh over a rape case is sick. This convo is done.   https://t.co/rBepS1oqCi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KennethMurwanto @HKrassenstein @MittRomney Again, might I remind you Trump is currently named (with Epstein) in a lawsuit involving an underage girl. Step down<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KennethMurwanto @HKrassenstein @MittRomney Your guy is currently named with Epstein in an underage rape case. Not to mention at least 40 counts of sexual harassment/rape/misconduct cases. Look up Epstein Trump calendar girls. Step down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KennethMurwanto @HKrassenstein @MittRomney What hasn’t trump lied about. Speaking of Trump’s character, I’ve personally noticed that people who worship Trump have either narcissistic tendencies, were abused or in an abusive relationship or are the abuser. Are you any of those?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KennethMurwanto @HKrassenstein @MittRomney The Russian collusion scandal has WAY more credibility than this crap😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KennethMurwanto @HKrassenstein @MittRomney Epstein, any relation to Jeffrey 😂 makes sense now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KennethMurwanto @HKrassenstein @MittRomney He didn’t lie to us about it either and deny science<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KennethMurwanto @HKrassenstein @MittRomney He’s our current president that needs to go. The Clintons aren’t even running😂🤣it would be like me bringing up the Bush<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KennethMurwanto @HKrassenstein @MittRomney I’m purposely throwing biased info at you to show you how ridiculous opinion pieces are😂 that’s all you’ve sent me, you’re just now picking up on that? 😂🤣🤣😂 please refer to the actual data I did sent. Speaks 4 itself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KennethMurwanto @HKrassenstein @MittRomney what is your obsession with the Clintons? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KennethMurwanto @HKrassenstein @MittRomney You can refer to the data I sent ya to see how Ibama compares to Trump😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KennethMurwanto @HKrassenstein @MittRomney Is this an opinion piece? Doesn’t seem to cite data to back up claims. Or is this another opinion piece we are throwing at each other😂 I can keep sending anti trump stuff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KennethMurwanto @HKrassenstein @MittRomney After a VIP client complained about Epstein hitting on his daughter. Why did Trumpwant Acosta? The guy who let Epstein off easy? Thank goodness Tim Cain started digging into that or else Epstein would still be free<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KennethMurwanto @HKrassenstein @MittRomney It’s interesting how you ONLY believe your bias. Anything that doesn’t agree with your preconceived thoughts is laughable,questionable or wrong. 😉perhaps you need to look into that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KennethMurwanto @HKrassenstein @MittRomney People died listening to him and following his example.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KennethMurwanto @HKrassenstein @MittRomney I’ve added his worst lies; misleading us on the coronavirus. But Q folk are too into their conspiracies to see that. Not to mention his poor handling/lies of environmental issues.  https://t.co/LfEWzq0Qor<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KennethMurwanto @HKrassenstein @MittRomney Trump has made over 20,000 false or misleading claims. Trump uses his Twitter account to bully those who go against him. When you compare stats (not rhetoric) you see Trump has performed abysmally. I could keep going on. Do your research<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KennethMurwanto @HKrassenstein @MittRomney This article was full of it... speculation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KennethMurwanto @HKrassenstein @MittRomney If you are going to believe that Hunter Biden crap, then you should also take a look at this:  https://t.co/m9y4btzIpV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KennethMurwanto @HKrassenstein @MittRomney If you are going to assume that’s what happened I’m going to assume Trump owes Russia (via Duetsche bank) and that’s why he turned his head on Russian bounties.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KennethMurwanto @HKrassenstein @MittRomney The two don’t compare, but I’m sure Q has you thinking otherwise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dontlickchalk No. I’ll leave once the Magats go away. We have to make sure Trump never happens again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KennethMurwanto @HKrassenstein @MittRomney The guy has always been a con artist. IDK how you guys can WORSHIP him so blindly. It’s evil.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KennethMurwanto @HKrassenstein @MittRomney I can’t believe you actually believe that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KennethMurwanto @HKrassenstein @MittRomney Hmmm last I checked the Republican committee found that the Russian investigation wasn’t so bogus.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@madavoid @D12Bossman @onlytruthhere @MittRomney @mattklewis I don’t think the press is lying about Trump as much as you think they are. Even if they were, surely you remember how Alt News, Rep money, Trump, Fox all lied About/treated Obama? No? PS. Dem party has changed platforms since civil war<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madavoid @boofy1970 @onlytruthhere @MittRomney @mattklewis I feel the EXACT same way about the Trump Train. Some of the ones lurking on James Woods account are mean as can be. Their “jokes” are violent and cruel. I wasn’t surprised by the whole Gov kidnapping thing honestly. It’s sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LovemesomeCPG @katkisses13 @madavoid @moyoungjr @onlytruthhere @MittRomney @mattklewis Because there was real evidence of ties to Russia. I still want to know who he owes so much money to and why he won’t release his taxes. Aren’t you curious?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madavoid @moyoungjr @onlytruthhere @MittRomney @mattklewis Do you think Obama was treated fairly by the right? No. He got us out of the Great Recession and did some good things in regards to healthcare but Fox and Alt News was relentless.including trump with his birtherism crap. Obama didn’t whine about it constantly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TrumpGraveDancer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thedonalddotwin You didn’t think Trump rising from the dead was an October surprise? I can’t take you seriously<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@felixducte @TaoGuyMike @CindiPargressiv @aretieare @latimes It’s congress and senate that Create and pass the bills. Don’t forget that.? With that said, his climate plan is 10 fold better than Trump’s. Getting cops and civil rights activists together for a police reform bill is smart. Don’t see that with trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@swede1956 Hell no<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@felixducte @TaoGuyMike @CindiPargressiv @aretieare @latimes I like the word ridiculous. Sorry I called you ridiculous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@felixducte @TaoGuyMike @CindiPargressiv @aretieare @latimes And news flash: the Obama admin made mistakes, but they moved us in the right direction. Look it up. That was with a ridiculous Senate (kept blocking him) second term. And getting us out of Great Recession first term. So stop being ridiculous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@felixducte @TaoGuyMike @CindiPargressiv @aretieare @latimes Trump is a climate change denier and has no plan for police reform, gun control, healthcare...he’s stacking our courts with ultra conservative judges who get rid of progress made. His tax cuts suck and Betsy D gots to go. So NO!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@felixducte @TaoGuyMike @CindiPargressiv @aretieare @latimes If you’re talking about trump, yes. Otherwise this is a ridiculous response<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reillynjames @KdcWoven @Strandjunker I’m so sorry to hear that. It breaks my heart for anyone that has been affected and I hope that symptoms do go away eventually<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FactsMatterPpl @TaoGuyMike @latimes Should this race be close, statistically insignificant becomes significant. Look up past elections. Also, Biden bros are like Fetch. Quit trying to make it happen. PS I didn’t start the term Bernie bros. Bernie bros did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is the deal?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I didn’t believe it, but it’s true. I had no idea. Makes things even more disturbing. #HandmaidAmy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PollyTix2020 Dirty person<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tsar_Anthony @TaoGuyMike @latimes I’m not saying you are, you’re the one engaging me because I made a comment about Bernie bros (meaning far left) that are Never Biden people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AmericaNeedsPennsylvania<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tsar_Anthony @TaoGuyMike @latimes A progressive senate and congress will be the ones to make things happen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tsar_Anthony @TaoGuyMike @latimes A person who wants to progress this country should vote for Biden. I am fully aware of his record and that’s why I say vote the most  progressive senate you can. A vote for trump is reversing what we’ve accomplished<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tsar_Anthony @TaoGuyMike @latimes Vote for trump is just as bad as being a proud boy in my eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tsar_Anthony @TaoGuyMike @latimes I’m not blaming Bernie bros. If you look at my original comment you’ll see I’m talking about the small percentage of Never Bideners that support progressive ideas. A third party can’t win this time sadly, so 3rd party =vote for trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tsar_Anthony @TaoGuyMike @latimes That’s a fact that really isn’t pertinent  to your argument. Presidents don’t win by pop vote. They win by electoral. Are you even from the US?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tsar_Anthony @TaoGuyMike @latimes Maybe you should spend less time on memes and more time learning about how elections work😕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yokoboji Vote!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tsar_Anthony @TaoGuyMike @latimes They are both voting for Trump, so pretty much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CindiPargressiv @TaoGuyMike @latimes And I’m sure Obama had plenty of white men to choose from🙄 he choose Biden for a reason. Biden was a good VP to him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CindiPargressiv @TaoGuyMike @latimes Also, get off Fox. That comment was taken out of context<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaoGuyMike @CindiPargressiv @latimes You’re a fool if you don’t think Trump is a career racist. Do your research. Again, Biden has a plan for reform that beats Trump’s I can see why Harris and Obama  chose to team with him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FactsMatterPpl @TaoGuyMike @latimes I’ll use Never Biden leftists in the future, but I’m pretty sure it’s the same people😕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FactsMatterPpl @TaoGuyMike @latimes It sounds like you have more of an issue with the term Bernie Bro than I do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FactsMatterPpl @TaoGuyMike @latimes Biden bros isn’t a thing for starters and I wouldn’t be a Biden Bro if it was. I have no beef with Bernie Bros EXCEPT the ones that are NEVER Bideners. It makes no sense. It’s a vote for Trump this time around even in red states.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FactsMatterPpl @TaoGuyMike @latimes I said Bernie bros that are never Biden people. There is a difference in my eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FactsMatterPpl @TaoGuyMike @latimes My beef is with that 10% who, at this point (because we unfortunately know a third candidate will never win) are throwing away their vote instead of voting straight D/independents (Green Party) that have a chance to win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FactsMatterPpl @TaoGuyMike @latimes Not Bernie Bros. Bernie Bros that are Never Biden people. That’s what I’ve said since the beginning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TonyShnark Lonesome loser<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CindiPargressiv @TaoGuyMike @latimes So you would vote for a candidate that has absolutely no intent to make any reforms over a Dem you don’t like because he made a statement years ago. I think if Obama got over it, so can I. You’ve proven my point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PenceFly #TheFly #flygate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaoGuyMike @CindiPargressiv @aretieare @latimes Look, if you want trump to win, vote third party or trump. It’s as simple as that. Make no mistakes, a trump presidency will get you further ways from your goals. Period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CindiPargressiv @TaoGuyMike @latimes If you’re not voting for Biden you are voting for Trump. It’s as simple as that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FactsMatterPpl @TaoGuyMike @latimes They are both working to get Trump elected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissngLnk @aretieare @CindiPargressiv @TaoGuyMike @latimes You act like I can’t look at yours🤣😂🤣 you try so hard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darealveggieman @TaoGuyMike @latimes You left the dem party to support a candidate that won’t win this year. You are basically voting for Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CindiPargressiv @aretieare @TaoGuyMike @latimes No third party candidate will get elected this round. Biden is working with other progressives to put together plans I would like to see passed. Can’t say that for Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissngLnk @aretieare @CindiPargressiv @TaoGuyMike @latimes None. Why? Are you jealous? 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThomasLinkoff @TaoGuyMike @latimes Should Bernie be ashamed of asking you to vote for Biden?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@salsacaek @aretieare @CindiPargressiv @TaoGuyMike @latimes And there are SO many Republicans and moderates we have to convince.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@salsacaek @aretieare @CindiPargressiv @TaoGuyMike @latimes So we get moderates to buy into our platform. In the past 8 yrs I’ve lived in 3red states and 2 swing states (one Florida) it’s not easy to persuade trump Republicans trust me. Fox News needs to go for start<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@salsacaek @aretieare @CindiPargressiv @TaoGuyMike @latimes Agreed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@salsacaek @aretieare @CindiPargressiv @TaoGuyMike @latimes Look at who he’s nominating for Supreme Court justices. What your saying doesn’t hold water<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@salsacaek @aretieare @CindiPargressiv @TaoGuyMike @latimes Trump doesn’t believe the majority of scientists about climate change. Mocking Greta is more than noise. It persuaded his base to deny it. Trump is investing in old energy not green energy. Definitely more than noise<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aretieare @salsacaek @CindiPargressiv @TaoGuyMike @latimes Obama spent his first term getting us out of the biggest recession we had seen and he still managed to pass ACA (which was a step in the right direction, trump wants to get rid of). It was at the cost of losing Senate. R Senate blocked everthing. Afterward<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@salsacaek @aretieare @CindiPargressiv @TaoGuyMike @latimes Sure! Until you find yourself in a situation where half the country (Figuratively speaking) is voting for a pres that makes fun of Greta Thunberg and is actively working on getting rid of lgbtqi/women’s rights.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@salsacaek @aretieare @CindiPargressiv @TaoGuyMike @latimes You misquoted me. I never said all Bernie bros. I specifically said the ones that were never bideners.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aretieare @CindiPargressiv @TaoGuyMike @latimes I disagree, trump is also the result of Fox News, Alt News, The Roger Stones and Alex Jones, 911 distrust of gov, racism, hate for Hillary and misinformation on Social media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@salsacaek @aretieare @CindiPargressiv @TaoGuyMike @latimes BTW I never said all bros just the never Bidens. I’ve found they have the same mindset as proud boys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@salsacaek @aretieare @CindiPargressiv @TaoGuyMike @latimes We know what we are getting with Trump. There’s some hope with Biden especially if we get Dems/Independents/ Green Party (If they have a chance) across the ticket.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaoGuyMike @YesIAteUrBaby @latimes Which is why I specifically said we need to focus on getting Dems across the ticket. Once they are, we can push for our platform. 🙄 Most of America is somewhere in the middle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaoGuyMike @YesIAteUrBaby @latimes I’m not sure how you got to that logic from what I said. It would depend on why you vote libertarian. Either way, a libertarian vote for president is a throw away vote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaoGuyMike @YesIAteUrBaby @latimes And you don’t think that could happen again? Trump will do whatever it takes. Dems need overwhelming numbers so that it doesn’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CodyTidwell9 @jessicabonds45 @latimes @PeteButtigieg That’s arrogant of you to assume I watch news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaoGuyMike @YesIAteUrBaby @latimes They are😂. It’s a numbers game. Maybe if we didn’t have an electoral college? Maybe if Green Party had more money and a stronger platform and there were less republicans? That’s not the case right now. Biden could lose if he doesn’t have Bernie bro’s.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YesIAteUrBaby @TaoGuyMike @latimes A vote for third party=a vote for Trump. Al Gore might have gotten the nomination had it not have been for Nader. Imagine how different things would be<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaoGuyMike @latimes Why should I play a hypothetical game that is flawed? I understood what point you were trying to make and disagree. Stop being controlling/stubborn and try to listen to mine instead of being condescending<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaoGuyMike @YesIAteUrBaby @latimes I was making a point. You apparently missed it.  Simply put, you can’t make assumptions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaoGuyMike @latimes You’re assuming 4 vote for Biden. What if 4 vote for trump,4 for Biden  2 for Green Party? We get stuck in legal battles that Trump will ultimately win. Meanwhile country goes to hell.  Or Biden 4,Green Party 1,Trump5. Polls are too close to assume.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaoGuyMike @YesIAteUrBaby @latimes You are assuming that only 2 will vote for Trump. It doesn’t work that way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaoGuyMike @latimes Trump is the biggest threat to the environment. A vote for third party =a vote for Trump. I don’t know how to simplify it anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YesIAteUrBaby @TaoGuyMike @latimes Notice I didn’t say ALL Bernie bros, just the never Bideners. Even Bernie is asking people to vote for Biden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YesIAteUrBaby @TaoGuyMike @latimes You are and you are too stubborn to realize it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CindiPargressiv @TaoGuyMike @latimes Bernie bro’s and proud boys are one in the same mentally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darealveggieman @TaoGuyMike @latimes Pete is actually progressive but level headed about it. I wish the country was comprised of nothing but hard left but it’s not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaoGuyMike @latimes A vote for a third party =a vote for Trump. Trump is the worst for the environment. You should have been pushing for Green Party LONG before and getting money their way. Best shot now is getting Dems across the ticket. Bernie agrees.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexDropkin @TaoGuyMike @latimes You’ve made my point. You sound just like a Proud Boy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CadreBhoy1910 @TaoGuyMike @latimes Just think, we might have had Al Gore if it hadn’t been for Nader. This world would look ALOT different<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexDropkin @TaoGuyMike @latimes Just remember we might have had Al Gore if it hadn’t been for Nader. Think about how far ahead we’d be right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexDropkin @TaoGuyMike @latimes Sure, if the Green Party candidate has a shot. Otherwise you have to be smart about your vote. Elect people like AOC, get involved BEFORE an election. Trump is the worst choice for the environment. NOW we focus on getting them out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KdcWoven @Strandjunker This doesn’t include the ones that have permanent damage because of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Strandjunker Who dances like that? 😂 certainly not a macho man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaoGuyMike @latimes If you really cared about the environment you would make sure Democrat’s/ Green Party owned all branches of Gov. instead you put your efforts into whining about the Dem’s presidential candidate. 3rd party isn’t getting pres this year. Face it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaoGuyMike @latimes Bernie bros that are never Bidens are just as bad as Proud Boys. Both are doing harm to America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trekkie1978 @jessicabonds45 @latimes @PeteButtigieg Genuinely asking, is this a pro trump or anti trump meme. I can’t tell.

<|startoftext|>@kodynxtdoor @CuriousYummies @EvanAKilgore Does that always make up for the costs of holding the World Cup? I’m not familiar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kodynxtdoor @CuriousYummies @EvanAKilgore Are we really including a bid for Mexico-Canada-US World Cup as a reason to vote for Trump? 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@minehike1313 @kodynxtdoor @CuriousYummies @EvanAKilgore I’m not arguing that one, just put that up for comparison.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kodynxtdoor @CuriousYummies @EvanAKilgore You can thank McConnell for the judges. He confirmed the fewest judges since President Truman during Obama's last two years in office, paving an increase for Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kodynxtdoor @CuriousYummies @EvanAKilgore Didn’t Regan try to put together a Space Force?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kodynxtdoor @CuriousYummies @EvanAKilgore Space Force does sound cool, I honestly know nothing about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@minehike1313 @kodynxtdoor @CuriousYummies @EvanAKilgore For comparison  https://t.co/JeLS4KyS90<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kodynxtdoor @CuriousYummies @EvanAKilgore And in regards to military spending:  https://t.co/DbN3b4cdyX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kodynxtdoor @CuriousYummies @EvanAKilgore Instead of coal we would be wiser to invest in clean energy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kodynxtdoor @CuriousYummies @EvanAKilgore Oh, I’m not including the pandemic. But if we did, Trump’s numbers would be abysmal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kodynxtdoor @CuriousYummies @EvanAKilgore Veterans Choice, which allows veterans to see doctors outside the government-run VA system at taxpayer expense, was first passed in 2014 under President Barack Obama.Trump falsely took credit for that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kodynxtdoor @CuriousYummies @EvanAKilgore In regards to opioids, Medicaid and ACA have helped (two programs Trump wants to cut) and prescriptions have been decreasing since 2010. Again, thanks Obama.  Under Trump drug overdoses have increased actually.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kodynxtdoor @CuriousYummies @EvanAKilgore Employment gains have been lower under the Trump administration. If you are going to include them you have to acknowledge that Obama was responsible for most of that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SKYRIDER4538 @JBOrl11 @EvanAKilgore @POTUS Trump supporters really shouldn’t be criticizing anyone’s intelligence 😬<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump IF Trump actually got Covid, he had access to care the rest of us don’t. Shame on him for minimizing a virus that has claimed so many lives<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kbuckborough @HKrassenstein I wondered about that as well. There was a shot of MSNBC zooming into the chopper window. It almost looked like Trump had taken off his mask.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@krjohnstn @HKrassenstein His base is dwindling. Last year the Trump Train was all over Twitter. They seem to be pretty silent😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rjayb013 @HKrassenstein To Magat suckers<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LawrenceHughes @Hobbes_Too @JamieBQuynn13 The only one that makes me think there’s something to it is Christie. But at this point who knows. They are all liars and cons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Spechal_K Division and to delegitimize the media. That’s always the reason. I’m starting to think this was all set up again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarkHorseKarma @LawrenceHughes @JamieBQuynn13 If real, he’s getting treatment that none of us get. This is just disturbing and ridiculous. It never ends with this president<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DumondVince @heyjudymodesta Maybe he should have worn his mask<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamieBQuynn13 @Chr_Steven_76 He has access to treatment none of us do. Who knows.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bill_Maxwell_ Except he’s getting treatment most of us don’t. This is terrible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sherry20D @TockTick5167AD @realDonaldTrump He’s also the only president to make money off of having government stay at his hotels.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You are getting treatment most of us don’t. I hope he realizes this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FloridaFunny @politico @JoeBiden @ABC @nbc @CBS @CNN @HLNTV @FoxNews Awe, did I put a hole in your theory and now you’re mad😂Well it’s obvious they all got it at the same event so someone’s rapid test came back a false negative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HeidiOCanada No<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamWeinstein Maybe he’s related to Michael Scott.  https://t.co/XtR1z4c21F<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@julie_kelly2 Trump will receive treatment that you nor I will have access to. That’s how he fought it... on our tax dollars<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So did Rick Scott test negative in a positive way? I could see ow someone like Rick Scott could get confused🤣  https://t.co/3aAyWoNcDF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mviser That guy is an idiot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FloridaFunny @politico @JoeBiden @ABC @nbc @CBS @CNN @HLNTV @FoxNews And if you really want something to think about, these senators we’re all doing “investigations” in regards to Russia info. Makes me think they’ve been meeting with Trump about it in private meetings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FloridaFunny @politico @JoeBiden @ABC @nbc @CBS @CNN @HLNTV @FoxNews They don’t listen to experts. That’s how. Easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shell_magaUSA @DanielNewman Did it occur to you that she might be worried for her dad?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@noles506 @ProfitMoney @DanielNewman Now you’re being classless. Welcome to the club.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anthony_buttons @thehill Unfortunately she also exposed her daughter and husband.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sterling2143 @thehill Ummm so he was spreading it to others while he smugly boasted that he was one of the ones that had no symptoms. Seems selfish considering the amount of Americans who fall into the high/ Moderate risk category.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MontanaDan30 I think a report came out today saying the earlier you get it the better the outcome. Unfortunately, I don’t see regular citizens getting that option<|endoftext|>

However, I don’t blame people for being skeptical about what’s going on with him. His administration has lied so much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump You mean all those he infected?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanspicer Do tell  https://t.co/fG35p7YBqo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bitchhatestrump I think the president will be fine. He’s getting good treatment and caught it early<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nate07868113 @onlytruthhere @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity This guy didn’t get the memo 😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Spechal_K The October surprise is that we find out it’s a hoax<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FLOTUS So I guess they are faking the virus to make it seem as if it’s not as bad as the media makes it seem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PCee52 Skeptical<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NitinKarri I don’t see Q as a reliable source or OAN if that’s what you are referring to. Any official document from Q is good, but you have to remember that Q has a narrative it’s based on. Any ? Or drops are done to help support it, disregarding whole pic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NitinKarri Of course they’ve screwed up. The older Dems need to go, they aren’t innocent. But don’t forget, we’ve had a Republican senate for 8 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NitinKarri Don’t get me wrong, MSM sucks. It should be called out. But not everything they report is fake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NitinKarri People wear I live still think it’s a hoax and wear the masks wrong or wear minimal protection. Others hang out with whomever, because it’s not as bad as the “MSM” says. The president encourages his people not to listen to MSM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NitinKarri Trump followers, listen to Trump so closely. Let’s take masks. Wearing a mask reduces spread significantly. But EVERYONE has to wear them. You had half the country thinking they were a hoax because Trump didn’t wear one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NitinKarri The issue people have with Trump is that he minimized the virus the whole time. We knew he was doing that, but his followers didn’t. Woodward tapes finally proved he was. Governors relied on his messaging because otherwise Trump followers would reject them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sophiabmurphy Is he really sick?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NitinKarri We should have cracked down on what was going on. It’s sad we didn’t<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NitinKarri Of course! We should rise above. But I’m also in a fortunate (knock on wood) position to have had anyone super close to me die from it. I don’t blame people for being angry at him for his minimizing the virus. His followers look up to him so much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NitinKarri Well there is a lot of evidence social media plays a big part in that interference. That should have been a priority after we found out a foreign gov used social media to interfere in our elections last time😕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NitinKarri some might think this is justice or karma. Unfortunately anger can blind people in the moment. Personally,I’m really skeptical of this, and think he’s using this to get more votes😕  so it’s hard to put emotion to this for now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NitinKarri Yes, but you have to remember the stages of grief.We are a grieving country right now.Covid, BLM. Anger is a part of that grieving process.I’m not saying it’s right, but because he hasn’t helped to heal and has further divided us by calling it a hoax...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NitinKarri Yeah, I get what you are saying. It’s the right and kind thing to do. I’m not justifying but I think a lot of people have lost someone to Covid and are angry right now, others in a bad situation economically. Others, might just think it’s fake<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NitinKarri The sad thing is half the country doesn’t really think he has Covid because he’s lied so much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shanari50 @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS I have a feeling the only hoax is this man saying he has Covid 19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ddanpereira @tribelaw Covid 19 isn’t a hoax, but I wonder if Trump getting covid 19 is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CatCaseyAZ @HBSurfCity @someknew @realDonaldTrump Exactly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stellablue9 I can’t help but wonder if Trump got the virus last year when this was all starting, and thought he still had immunity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HBSurfCity @someknew @realDonaldTrump Did you miss the whole Starbucks “War on Christmas “ thing Republicans/Fox News threw a fit about?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeaQween @HBSurfCity @someknew @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/ZnxcSOsO10<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HBSurfCity @someknew @realDonaldTrump Republicans complain if a Starbucks cup doesn’t say Merry Christmas. Apparently Christmas decorations are a big deal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricTrump They weren’t so ridiculous last year when the Russians used it to get your dad elected were they? 😂 karma<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MrMichaelBurkes You’ll probably get a lot of Proud Boys and White Supremacists because Trump clearly empowered them tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Free_nthee @RudyGiuliani Whining? Just calling it for how it is. 😏 you must be one of those illogical people that gets offended by anything that doesn’t agree with your opinions<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PatAaron10 Not really, but Trump is an A-hole. His questions are at least decent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 It’s the behavior of someone who knows he’s going up against a liar and wants to be able to fact check<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LoggiaSal @FathersDaughte4 @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris But you’re being spoon fed what to believe with Q😂  you guys all say the same things😂 wake up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FathersDaughte4 @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris You have a loose definition of truth<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@joysong47672442 @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris Yes, I think this Q cult is hilarious as well. And disturbing at the same time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J_M_Fulkerson @LeeMagna @zoecharlotte7 @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris You’re used to finding information that supports your case. I never said all information from Q was from unreliable sources. A lot in the community is though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeMagna @zoecharlotte7 @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris You only evaluate the sources that confirm your conspiracies or narratives. And some of the sources that many of you all have provided as “proof” aren’t reliable at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zoecharlotte7 @LeeMagna @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris Could have fooled me; it sure seems like you are determined to change my mind. Either way,  I hope you really are as open minded as you think you are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zoecharlotte7 @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris Group thinkers using conspiracies created by partial (sometimes incorrect) information to reinforce the narrative Q has put forth. No accountability.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeMagna @zoecharlotte7 @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris SOME of the info you look at is real. Sure. But you only get the part that confirms Q’s conspiracies. Also, a huge part of research requires evaluating sources. A lot of what you call “proof” isn’t reliable or validated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#EndTrumpChaos #EndTrumpsChaos<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zoecharlotte7 @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris And you are acting like their isn’t a community sharing information and reinforcing conspiracies together.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zoecharlotte7 @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris That’s not true. Q drops are most certainly set up so that you find the information they want you to find and group think the conclusions they want you to come to. It all reinforces the narrative they want you to support.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@us_poll @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris Im actually a moderate independent, but nice try<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peachylaurey @us_poll @zoecharlotte7 @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris 👍🏼Make sure to fact check.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peachylaurey @zoecharlotte7 @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris You don’t know me. I do know  1 John 4:21, John 13:34, Romans 14:13-18. Calling me names and passing judgement because of your hate for Democrats is not fruitful behavior. Check your heart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@us_poll @peachylaurey @zoecharlotte7 @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris If you are hearing it a lot maybe there is some truth to it😬 Check your heart<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peachylaurey @zoecharlotte7 @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris I’m a Christian, so you can say or do what you want to me, but I sincerely urge you to check your heart. Your hate for Democrats is contradictory to what the Bible teaches us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@debbyfleiss @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris You found the stuff people in Q wanted you to find 😮<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peachylaurey @zoecharlotte7 @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris Turn off the TV and read the Bible. I mean that sincerely because it’s people like you that turn people away from Christianity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dmfact @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris You said I don’t think for myself. I’m not going to argue with you in rhetoric<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dmfact @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris But it does. All info is purposeful in its design to back up the narrative it has set forth. The crumbs lead people to group think the conspiracies they want you to come up with. Its genius. You don’t get the full picture.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dmfact @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris This is why I say you only believe “thinking for yourself” means “believe in my beliefs”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dmfact @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris You have closed your mind to the idea that I might have gone down that road and chosen to believe differently. You just assume that anyone who doesn’t believe the Q narrative is too lazy to do “research”. That’s not true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@insighttooit @zoecharlotte7 @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris Say what you want. In the end, you’re the one in a Q cult. Just trying to help ya out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvanE21579990 @dmfact @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris It’s through talking to people like you 😂  https://t.co/YNRnbe9trM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peachylaurey @zoecharlotte7 @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris You will believe what you want to believe. It happens a lot to people who fall for cults. Good luck with that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@insighttooit @zoecharlotte7 @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris You’re just spitting out terms someone has thrown at you. It’s called projecting. There are professionals that can help you with that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvanE21579990 @dmfact @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris Thinking for yourself 😂🤣😂 don’t you realize your Magat/Q community is just spitting out the same thought? 🤣 you guys all come to the same baseless conspiracies. It’s designed that way. At least I’m aware of the indoctrination, you’re clueless to #45Cult<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidjsorensen @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris The requirement for what you call proof is embarrassing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@annettenorthcu2 @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris I know conspiracies are just conspiracies. You can’t turn them into facts because you like the way they sound and it agrees with whatever narrative you have in your head.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dmfact @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris You judge that I haven’t already and accuse me of not “thinking” because I say Q is a cult. That is a HUGE indicator of what you believe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tre50259386 @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris Wow, I see you and Trump are the same. Saying something without any evidence Doesn’t automatically make it true. I never even said I watched news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrewsterBruh @dmfact @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris nobody is arguing that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tre50259386 @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris Are these commentators?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tre50259386 @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tre50259386 @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris Besides Maddow, whom I’ve never watched in its entirety 🤣 I have no idea who the other people are. Nice try. You should focus on the resources you’ve been using and see if they are reliable enough to consider “research” worthy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tre50259386 @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris ? I’m not sure what that is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zoecharlotte7 @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris There is some info that comes out that is true. I won’t deny that. However, just like MSM it’s biased. The drops are intended for you to come up with the theory they want you to believe. It always fits their narrative and never give all information.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tre50259386 @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris You really have no idea where I get my information, so that wasn’t a very effective dig😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tre50259386 @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris No. 😒 No it’s not. Anyone can make up crap on the internet. You have to see where the source comes from and if it’s proven to be reliable in the past. You have to objectively look at the bias and take that into account and you have to use multiple sources. L<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zoecharlotte7 @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris And what promises has he kept?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tre50259386 @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris A HUGE part of research requires that you evaluate your resources. These must be sources that have been reliable in the past. You also have to use multiple sources. Almost every time I’ve spoken with a Trump supporter this has been missing in their research<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dmfact @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris To you “Thinking for yourself “ means “Believe in my conspiracies or my beliefs”. It’s void of solid scientific data, logic and actual facts. And full of group think conspiracies/propaganda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tre50259386 @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris I never called anyone dumb. Unfortunately, some people weren’t taught the proper research skills and how to identify facts VS fiction.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ReallySicha @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris Haha, I stopped at no leaders🤣 While he’s not a great one, Trump is still a leader... of your cult. Make no mistake, Q is coming from his admin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zoecharlotte7 @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris I’ve done quite a bit of research on both sides (including having in depth conversations with people following Q), but I don’t think you have. You’re just going to believe what you want to believe.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MagaLikeTrump @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris When you say “Thinking for yourself” you really mean “think what my people think or in my conspiracies ”. It’s often void of facts, proof and data. Group thinking isn’t independent thinking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@agathodharma @2014_judi @99freemind @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris You’re a fool if you don’t think Trump and Republicans are doing the same or worse.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nyccookies 💙💙💙🌊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ronniecolumbia @JulianRichards8 @FreeSpeechPowe1 @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump It’s all propaganda. I will say Trump is VERY good at promoting himself and propaganda<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JulianRichards8 @ronniecolumbia @FreeSpeechPowe1 @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Trump had four years and trade got worse. There wasn’t evidence that it was getting better, just rhetoric<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JulianRichards8 @ronniecolumbia @FreeSpeechPowe1 @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Contacts between Trump's team and Russians. Russian meddling in the 2016 election.(the FBI had already knowledge of this hence “Obamagate”🙄). Trump's real estate dealings in Russia.  https://t.co/YtwFXppbE9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JulianRichards8 @ronniecolumbia @FreeSpeechPowe1 @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Nope. You’re like someone in an abusive relationship that makes excuses for everything their abusive partner does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JulianRichards8 @ronniecolumbia @FreeSpeechPowe1 @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump This sounds like another Pizzagate. Another Obamagate🤣 keep swinging.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JulianRichards8 @ronniecolumbia @FreeSpeechPowe1 @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump I can’t believe you are still trying to hold onto Obamagate🤣. There was WAY more evidence for the Trump Russia Scandal (even the Republican Senate confirmed that) yet you choose to hide behind Obamagate🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JulianRichards8 @ronniecolumbia @FreeSpeechPowe1 @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Except parts of the dossier have been proven to be true, other parts haven’t been proven yet, and very little was shown as false. You can’t say something is fake just because you don’t like it🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JulianRichards8 @ronniecolumbia @FreeSpeechPowe1 @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump He should have started it earlier 😏 there was already plenty of evidence. Did Q not drop that part to you? Or are you getting your info from Alex Jones? 🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JulianRichards8 @ronniecolumbia @FreeSpeechPowe1 @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Again, notice our foreign trade balance is worse than it was during the Obama years.

<|startoftext|>@JulianRichards8 @ronniecolumbia @FreeSpeechPowe1 @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump I like how you just skip over the 500+ national security experts😂. Trump is not only dangerous  for us, he’s bad for the world. It’s sad.  https://t.co/kNb01KMg9C<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JulianRichards8 @ronniecolumbia @FreeSpeechPowe1 @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Speaking of patriotism. Did you know over 500 national security experts and over 200 ex generals/admirals are openly endorsing Biden? That should tell you something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JulianRichards8 @ronniecolumbia @FreeSpeechPowe1 @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump You keep talking about mushrooms. Mushrooms have a lot of vitamin D.

<|startoftext|>@JulianRichards8 @ronniecolumbia @FreeSpeechPowe1 @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump 1)the dossier wasn’t the thing that started the investigation.2) Some aspects of the dossier have been corroborated;Putin and Russia actively favored Trump over Clinton and Trump campaign officials did have multiple secret meetings with Russians...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JulianRichards8 @ronniecolumbia @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Did you know the Bible talks about loving one another? You should talk to a Pastor or therapist about why you feel the need to show love by calling people mean names.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hockeymn25 @roxnola1 @HMSPitts @iastClone @SenCoryGardner You have to call people names because you have nothing else. I sent you actual data, didn’t even include Trump’s pathetic response to the pandemic. Also, I’m not a fan of his tax cuts, positions on LGBTQI, and his pushing if conspiracies/lies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hockeymn25 @roxnola1 @HMSPitts @iastClone @SenCoryGardner And there are more reasons. You guys really should stop projecting your own conspiracies.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@seanspicer @JoeBiden You guys just take everything Dems say and turn it around. The only difference is that when Dems say these things about Trump, it’s true<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SheilaG36880996 @TNSociallyMissy Where does it say that? I’m genuinely asking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SheilaG36880996 @TNSociallyMissy you don’t think we should be good stewards of the earth instead of actively trying to kill it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeTalkShow Thank you, I was thinking we were going full herd immunity. Folks, if you social distance, wear masks and practice good hygiene we can do this. I won’t be going into those restaurants or gyms though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaskWeara @JoeTalkShow @GregAbbott_TX Millions of people are. Not to mention, we have ridiculously high obesity rates. This is ridiculous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeTalkShow @GregAbbott_TX Millions of people have pre-existing conditions. How can you protect them and open up economy? 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SheilaG36880996 @TNSociallyMissy Idk if that’s really proof though. Scientist aren’t saying winter, summer, night, day and all harvest will cease because of Climate change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SheilaG36880996 @TNSociallyMissy What does the Bible say about climate change?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JulianRichards8 @ronniecolumbia @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump I say this in the sincerest way, see a professional<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JulianRichards8 @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump You project a lot. Have you thought about talking to a professional about that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JulianRichards8 @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Make no mistake, those behind “Q” are doing the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JulianRichards8 @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump You can make change without pushing unproven conspiracies and degrading strangers on the internet. In fact, you’d be WAY more successful in making a change that way. Think about...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ColtsPacers_Fan @jaredthefox92 @TheBlueBubba @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump That’s a good thing, look up the amount of growth Obama made vs the amount of growth Trump made. I wonder what part of this sentence you’re going to take out of context😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ColtsPacers_Fan @jaredthefox92 @TheBlueBubba @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Is that all you could read? I can see why you are a Trump supporter. You both have the same attention span<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ColtsPacers_Fan @jaredthefox92 @TheBlueBubba @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Is that what you took from my statement? I prefer to stick with facts. I would advise you do the same and reread what I was said without omitting words or over generalizations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ColtsPacers_Fan @jaredthefox92 @TheBlueBubba @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump As in Trump revoking the policy didn’t stop drone strikes, just accountability and transparency<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ColtsPacers_Fan @jaredthefox92 @TheBlueBubba @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Yes, it was Obama that was transparent about numbers and created a policy to let the American people know what was going on, Trump revoked that policy and so that we wouldn’t know what he is doing. He’s a very good con man. Very good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JulianRichards8 @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Palestine wasn’t even part of the signing. While maybe a good thing (probably just another failed NK situation though) peeps are making it WAY more than it was, the ones who signed weren’t at war. you shouldn’t call people names if you care about peace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JulianRichards8 @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Wait, are you talking about the DNC or Trump supporters? You’re describing Trump supporters. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JulianRichards8 @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Q is for people who probably aren’t successful in life;maybe didn’t do well in school.Manipulated drops aimed at pushing a narrative are left so that you can group think paths to get to that narrative not based on  https://t.co/z13DGlvpH4 shouldn’t criticize.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jaredthefox92 @TheBlueBubba @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Also, it’s apparent the Trump administration hasn’t been as transparent as the Obama Administration. The whole point of the policy Trump revoked was for transparency purposes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jaredthefox92 @TheBlueBubba @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump I didn’t get it from the anonymous wizard of Q if that’s what you are asking😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaredthefox92 @TheBlueBubba @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Furthermore, there have been 2,243 drone strikes in the first two years of the Trump presidency, compared with 1,878 in Mr Obama's eight years in office<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaredthefox92 @TheBlueBubba @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Oh you weren’t aware? Trump revoked the policy set by Obama requiring US intelligence officials to publish the number of civilians killed in drone strikes outside of war zones.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JulianRichards8 @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Yes, a coincidence. Coincidences do happen. Conspiracies are just conspiracies unless proven to be true. You can’t make them into fact just because it sounds real to you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JulianRichards8 @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump I could say the same about yours🤔😏<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@katht_richeson @definitelynick_ @MorganEdde @mmpadellan @realDonaldTrump I don’t blame you (yet).

<|startoftext|>@katht_richeson @definitelynick_ @MorganEdde @mmpadellan @realDonaldTrump I know some anonymous person high up (probably appointed by Trump 😂) leaves crumbs for people to group think their way into a narrative that fits the narrative they’ve fed you😂 You all mistake conspiracy for fact and use that to build more conspiracies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@definitelynick_ @MorganEdde @mmpadellan @realDonaldTrump Check the death certificate of all 190,000 people?

<|startoftext|>@tammiesue44 @Dreamweasel @realDonaldTrump Just look at statistics and compare what he’s done to past presidents. You’d see he’s actually a disappointing president. I don’t watch news and read from all kinds of sources. You take out the BS and you find he sucks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@happyclam21 @blake_add @PhDinProgress17 @realDonaldTrump I’m speaking truth, and the fact that that’s all you can say supports it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tammiesue44 @Dreamweasel @realDonaldTrump And neither does Trump. Despite the propaganda the right has you believing, Democrats are part of that average working man and woman. We make up at LEAST half the population. Don’t be fooled.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tammiesue44 @Dreamweasel @realDonaldTrump based on your response, it sounds like you’re the one brainwashed by propaganda. I’d hope you would be able to reflect upon that, but instead I’m sure I’ll get another infantile and rehearsed response 🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr The only way trump can win is by dividing the country. It’s sad he’s so bad of a president that he has to tear our country apart just to get nominated again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump has to divide the country with his lies so that people get excited enough to vote for him. That’s how bad of a president he is. #TrumpRiots<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jubjub302 @jana31119208 @DarkDeeM @glennbeck @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama You do, using the techniques I stated earlier. Everything needs to be fact checked these days using multiple sources. WTS I’ve found fact checking sites to actually be pretty reliable, biased in what they check but reliable. You have to double check though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jubjub302 @jana31119208 @DarkDeeM @glennbeck @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Use fact checkers ESPECIALLY when getting info from Trump’s Twitter and politically oriented radio shows. No accountability there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jubjub302 @jana31119208 @DarkDeeM @glennbeck @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Ask: Are these sources legitimate? Have they proved reliable in the past?Do they have a discernible bias? Is it being reported by multiple sources, check the writers credentials, good sources usually label opinion, stay away from conspiracy. Use fact checkers<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jana31119208 @DarkDeeM @glennbeck @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama He hasn’t done any of these. They might have told you he did, but fact check it using reliable sources and you’ll see it’s not what you think. Sorry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jana31119208 @glennbeck @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama What accomplishments? Make sure to fact check them before you list them😏 you’ll find your list is very short.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RudyGiuliani Is this clown talking to Obama because this is Trump’s America<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrapperBags @Stephan06977757 @AnneMarieResist @realDonaldTrump there was a moment in which I thought libertarians would break away from Republicans and become a strong party, unfortunately they are being swallowed by Trump Republicans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Moreskyplease @atrupar I feel the same way about Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar “Now that I’m a Trump Republican” it’s officially a party of its own.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KellyannePolls We all know why he employs the women he does. He doesn’t choose women for their intellect unfortunately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stephan06977757 @AnneMarieResist @realDonaldTrump Basically, I’m pointing out that your logic doesn’t hold because the only ones not being hypocrites are kkk and a-holes who say they are racist. Most Republicans say they aren’t. Let me guess, you were a Bernie supporter?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stephan06977757 @AnneMarieResist @realDonaldTrump I didn’t say you’re racist, just saying you sound like you are sympathizing with KKK. KKK knows they are racist, so they aren’t being a hypocrite just A-holes. Most other Republicans are hypocrites because they say they aren’t racist but many are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stephan06977757 @AnneMarieResist @realDonaldTrump With that said, I get it. Our movements don’t get national attention. I’m not sure why honestly, but I do know that there are 33 latinx Democrats and only 5 Republicans in the House of Representatives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stephan06977757 @AnneMarieResist @realDonaldTrump Ha, just because they are called out for it doesn’t mean they admit they are😬. It almost sounds like you’re sympathizing with the KKK.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realTuckFrumper So KellyAnn Conway will be voting for Biden? 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bullshitsir @PostFomo @saziz01b @FrankLuntz Okay, thanks. I hope you learn from those classes. There’s no excuse for ignorance at this point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump News flash, they’ve already crashed. They probably want him to win so that they don’t have to hear you call Corona Virus the China Virus. 🙄 Also, our Trade Balance was better under Obama, soooo...  https://t.co/ZPlAwrFFCQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bullshitsir @PostFomo @saziz01b @FrankLuntz That’s not an actual disorder. Perhaps a psychology class would be helpful to you as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bullshitsir @PostFomo @saziz01b @FrankLuntz Since you like pictures: Foreign Trade balance fluctuated but held steady during the Obama administration. Duuring Trump era, the deficit started to increase to levels not seen since the Bush administration - despite him vowing to "start whittling it down”  https://t.co/pWfowayuNC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bullshitsir @PostFomo @saziz01b @FrankLuntz Maybe a research and science class as well. Both teach you how to distinguish between reliable and unreliable sources. Fact vs Fiction. Proven vs unproven. I’ve noticed Trump supporters have an issue with that. 🤷🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricTrump @DanScavino Is there a reason why you are promoting a video showing your dad as a little man?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tiffwright79 @saziz01b @FrankLuntz His poor handling of it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bullshitsir @PostFomo @saziz01b @FrankLuntz You should probably take basic math classes first. Statistics show that we had WAY better growth under the Obama admin. #StrongerwithBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mike_Pence @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Promises kept? Are you joking? What promises did he keep? He did less than Obama did to fulfill his promises.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABirkshire Most Dems want socialist programs   Not socialism. Biden is moderate, that’s why many Republicans are on board with him. Im voting for Biden because of Trump’s terrible environmental and LGBTQ record amongst other things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABirkshire I’ve been researching Q Anon for awhile.What I’ve found is they purposely feed you crumbs that they want you to use to paint the picture they want you to see.When you dig further you see they aren’t giving you the whole truth.Check this out:  https://t.co/uBiMrdBItU<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @SteveFDA And you waited right before the election to fight the drug companies because.... ? No thank you. Close the Windows.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HannibalQHam @Whodey6708 @BrownTacopark @eatadog @RealJamesWoods That wasn’t for you, that was for the guy talking about Russia.  I think it’s fabulous that the issue was brought back into the spotlight because Tim Kaine saw that Acosta let Epstein off easily, I hate that Q is Using the issue for their benefit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Whodey6708 @HannibalQHam @BrownTacopark @eatadog @RealJamesWoods Oh, did you not see the news from yesterday? Haha, your fed to you talking points are out of date 🤣 this is what happens when you rely on Hannity and Q to tell you what to say.  https://t.co/gZ1LSzmnYI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Whodey6708 @HannibalQHam @BrownTacopark @eatadog @RealJamesWoods Sad that you’ve been brainwashed by the Q narrative which prevents you from taking an unbiased view. At least 25 women have come forth with sexual abuse/rape/harassment allegations on Trump. He also knew Epstein better than he now admits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HannibalQHam @Whodey6708 @BrownTacopark @eatadog @RealJamesWoods If that’s your inquiry, I have to question your intentions on this issue. Are you really wanting to find truth, or just find the truth you’ve been fed?  https://t.co/FSlCdfPjIb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HannibalQHam @Whodey6708 @BrownTacopark @eatadog @RealJamesWoods Haha, Q didn’t include this in it’s drops😂🤣 seriously though, it’s so sad that Q Anon is using this horrible issue to promote the president and take down those that disagree with them🙄 Trump is no hero.   https://t.co/Eftk1Bagoq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Whodey6708 @HannibalQHam @BrownTacopark @eatadog @RealJamesWoods It’s not common sense, it’s garbage that (I’m pretty sure the Trump Administration) is throwing at you to make you see what they want you to see. You have to look at ALL the info.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Whodey6708 @HannibalQHam @BrownTacopark @eatadog @RealJamesWoods When Trump brought Acosta in, Tim Cain started looking into him. He realized that Acosta let Epstein off easy. (Paraphrasing, look it up) Trump is no hero in this. Also, thought you’d wanna look this up as well. Do your own research  https://t.co/0Vr0Lpigim<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HannibalQHam @BrownTacopark @Whodey6708 @eatadog @RealJamesWoods Here’s the thing, Trump kicked Epstein out only after it was going to look bad for his brand. What’s annoying is that Trump uses tabloids like The Sun (and I’m positive he’s behind Q) to spread his lies and narrative. And you eat it up. Only hurts victims.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HannibalQHam @Whodey6708 @BrownTacopark @eatadog @RealJamesWoods Unlike, you who thinks Trump is a savior😂, I’m on board for sending Clinton to jail if he is found guilty. Trump is as creepy as it gets, so many sexual allegations, gross comments about underage girls, and there ARE Epstein ties whether you like it or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Whodey6708 @HannibalQHam @BrownTacopark @eatadog @RealJamesWoods 😂🤣😂🤣 gathering “evidence” from the group think Q cult is hardly truth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HannibalQHam @BrownTacopark @Whodey6708 @eatadog @RealJamesWoods 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂 you criticize Vox but you won’t criticize The Sun😂 classic Trump supporter move<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Whodey6708 @HannibalQHam @BrownTacopark @eatadog @RealJamesWoods Q is a cult. Open your eyes. They feed you the evidence they want you to “research”. The. You guys group think how it fits your narrative. Clinton should be convicted if he’s guilty, I’m also not stupid enough to think Trump is innocent and a hero in this🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HannibalQHam @BrownTacopark @Whodey6708 @eatadog @RealJamesWoods Haha, you refuse to see anything the freak Q doesn’t feed you🤣 the whole point, was to show that there are other true indicators other than a picture showing a Trump/Epstein connection. Did Q not tell you about the other victim who saw Trump on island?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HannibalQHam @BrownTacopark @Whodey6708 @eatadog @RealJamesWoods 1) As opposed to the “evidence” coming out of Q? 🤣😂 2) you’re just regurgitating what I said🤣, not very clever are you? 3)You disregarded the facts at bottom of the article. Very Q of you🤣 pick and choose.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cardlaw35 @pjteacher55 @Hold2LLC @HotZone_Chiller @CGC6000 @brbarnwell1 @kweenofheartzz @benshapiro I do think it’s important to take ALL data into account.

<|startoftext|>@HotZone_Chiller @pjteacher55 @CGC6000 @brbarnwell1 @kweenofheartzz @benshapiro I’ll agree, that was a mistake on Cuomo’s part and I’m glad DeSantis saw that and did something. He shouldn’t have stopped there though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pjteacher55 @CGC6000 @HotZone_Chiller @brbarnwell1 @kweenofheartzz @benshapiro DeSantis is definitely someone that needs Trump supporters in his side. I was living in Florida when he barely got the nomination.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CGC6000 @HotZone_Chiller @brbarnwell1 @kweenofheartzz @benshapiro Okay, then why did he use his twitter platform to push people and governors  into taking steps that were against the best evidence we had at the time? Many Rep Governors KNOW they need Trump’s followers to survive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CGC6000 @HotZone_Chiller @brbarnwell1 @kweenofheartzz @benshapiro Was this when he was threatening to pull out of WHO?  The guy isn’t even using the correct data. You have to look at deaths to population to assess how we are doing. Instead he tries to only highlight what makes him look good. Not helpful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReallyAmerican1 Lock him up, lock him up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HotZone_Chiller @CGC6000 @brbarnwell1 @kweenofheartzz @benshapiro Other countries made mistakes as well, but notice the ones that relied on the best evidence out there are doing better. I never compared Ebola and Corona. It was always about leadership style and using logic and gut over just gut and ego.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HotZone_Chiller @CGC6000 @brbarnwell1 @kweenofheartzz @benshapiro My whole point was that Trump buys into conspiracies so will make decisions based on that over science. I know science isn’t perfect, you didn’t have to be snippy with me about it,but it’s the best we have. Trump only looks at the data which favors him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CGC6000 @brbarnwell1 @HotZone_Chiller @kweenofheartzz @benshapiro I love that you thought Bruce was so dumb that you had to clarify 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CGC6000 @brbarnwell1 @HotZone_Chiller @kweenofheartzz @benshapiro You all keep speaking for me, sooooo..... 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brbarnwell1 @HotZone_Chiller @CGC6000 @kweenofheartzz @benshapiro You haven’t even asked what I meant🤣 you’re just making stupid assumptions and comments. Are you used to people not taking you seriously?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brbarnwell1 @HotZone_Chiller @CGC6000 @kweenofheartzz @benshapiro 1)*You’re 2) you keep assuming that’s what I meant. It’s not. You, like your Q friends, make incorrect assumptions and call it truth/facts🤣 it’s far from it most of the time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piere_sr @DavidJHarrisJr I like how you consider being an A-hole on Twitter your “job”🤣, I’m pretty sure you’re the same in real life.  Do all mental facilities allow cell phones in the rooms or are you tweeting from the shared computer?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piere_sr @DavidJHarrisJr Haha, read what you just wrote🤣 I don’t think you have the right to call anyone a moron. Judging by the writing style and thought process, I’m guessing this is you.  https://t.co/X1UBahbhoJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piere_sr @DavidJHarrisJr I’ll have your hall pass, Alex Jones, bring them up for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piere_sr @DavidJHarrisJr I bet you have a lot of fantasies about that finger😏 does your significant other know about them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wes_futureman @kws017013 @mallen2010 @ProjectLincoln Haha, thanks. It’s all in good fun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piere_sr @DavidJHarrisJr Maybe you should actually work and get off Twitter🤣 You don’t sound very productive. Look up the word “hypocrite”. You’ll see a picture of your face next to the description Romney wannabe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrJersey4 @DLoesch Because unlike Trump, Biden has acknowledged, apologized, learned from and changed his stances. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrJersey4 @DavidJHarrisJr And I saw lots of photos with Trump and the Epstein’s.Should I assume Trump was in bed with the Epsteins?That’s actually more believable than saying The ONLY reason Kamala is in her position is because she slept with men🙄 enough w sexist stupidity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DLoesch @MrJersey4 It’s devastating in that it’s typical GOP propaganda<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrJersey4 @DavidJHarrisJr Might I remind you (I’m betting) you also don’t know her personally to know what was actually going on there. You just hear other people say it and automatically believe the man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrJersey4 @DavidJHarrisJr I’m saying that you fixate on her act of doing so, without seeing that she’s extremely capable of being in her position anyways because of her intelligence and drive you are pushing a sexist narrative. You don’t hear people talking about men this way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piere_sr @DavidJHarrisJr Awe, did I hurt your ego baby man? I’ll tell Alex Jones you said hi while I’m down in the basement😂. While I’m doing so, let me remind you about your idiot leader.  https://t.co/tyUr9cJ4OK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrJersey4 @DavidJHarrisJr Harris is intelligent, driven and hard working. If you can’t recognize that and want to continue smearing her because of a sexist narrative that you fail to acknowledge, shame on you. I feel bad for your daughters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piere_sr @DavidJHarrisJr Your fantasies are only telling of your pathetic life, not hers. 😏🔥🔥🔥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wes_futureman @ProjectLincoln Good point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wes_futureman @kws017013 @mallen2010 @ProjectLincoln You with your narcissism. As if I wanted your critiques 🤣. But thanks? Haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrJersey4 @DavidJHarrisJr While you’re at it, you should admit to them that it’s people like you that hold women down.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@anondeleo @HotZone_Chiller @benshapiro That Magats don’t have intelligence? Glad we agree🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wes_futureman @ProjectLincoln I’ve read your responses😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wes_futureman @kws017013 @mallen2010 @ProjectLincoln You’re only seeing it from your perspective of course😏 It’s no surprise you missed the point.  Is this how you carry on in your Q forums? It’s no wonder all of your theories are outrageously wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wes_futureman @ProjectLincoln I’m thinking narcissism, manic people aren’t annoying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anondeleo @HotZone_Chiller @benshapiro Perhaps that’s because you’re only speaking with Magats😂  I never have problems finding intelligence in progressives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wes_futureman @ProjectLincoln 😂🤣😂you REALLY think highly of yourself. Is it narcissism or just a good ole’ manic episode?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wes_futureman @kws017013 @mallen2010 @ProjectLincoln Yup. 😏I’m glad we agree. Qult member<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrJersey4 @DavidJHarrisJr She’s an intelligent, driven and hard working woman. I’m not surprised this is the narrative men are using to bring her down. Oldest trick in the book, get new material.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bcrider77 @DavidJHarrisJr @oughtoh She’s an intelligent, driven and hard working woman. The fact that you feel the need to tear her down by implicating a woman can only get ahead through sex, is sad and degrading. Do you do it to get attention from men? So sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pamelalibrefree @DavidJHarrisJr Don’t be jealous of her because you’ve done nothing but tear other women down with your life. Do you do it because you need validation from men? Let that sink in. Must be tough being you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidJHarrisJr She’s an intelligent, driven and hard working woman. I’m not surprised this is the narrative men are using to bring her down. Oldest trick in the book, get new material.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HotZone_Chiller @CGC6000 @kweenofheartzz @benshapiro What are you talking about?!? Hahahaha. You should spend less time on Twitter and more time on learning how to read, understand and analyze scientific studies. Are you one of those windmills cause cancer people as well?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HotZone_Chiller @kweenofheartzz @benshapiro One denies science. Case closed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peterjhasson Yes, but if Obama had done what Trump did and denied it’s existence, we’d have way more than two<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hollysoriano @WBunchuck @ACTBrigitte @TulsiGabbard @KamalaHarris Running for president isn’t cheap. You mistaking Tulsi’s poor decision making skills for tenacity is pretty dumb as well😂 just stating the facts.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hollysoriano @WBunchuck @ACTBrigitte @TulsiGabbard She kept running even when it was obvious she was going to lose. That just tells me she’s dumb<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KellyO I don’t think it’s a coincidence that he brought in Tata yesterday, a guy known for his Anti-Muslim sentiment. This is a distraction aimed to get Trump elected again.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jaspe_rouge @CunitedPt @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump Him saying he doesn’t care is part of a defense to shield his ego.

<|startoftext|>@mybleaf_ @ShoopsNChicks @VoteBlueNov3rd @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Critical thinking requires thinking rationally.

<|startoftext|>@t_trump @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump And what are you? 😏 you seem to put a lot of energy doing the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dontatmemf @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump 🤔 project much?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaniCoscarelli @JulioRa21258913 @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump That’s not true. If you look at the numbers, Obama pulled us out of a deep recession and put us on an upward trajectory. Seems like Dems we’re working tirelessly to put money in our pockets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@e_heglin 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anti_BS_01 Maybe because you guys keep breaking the rules🙄 false information is big with you guys. I see a lot of victim mentality with Trump supporters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PROPHETE_XV I see that now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PROPHETE_XV It really depends on where you live. I used to live in Texas when it was all red. No matter what I voted the red candidate was going to win. We need to send a message this time, super high popular vote as well as electoral.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PROPHETE_XV I get it. I can tell you want to do what’s best for the country.I think the best shot we have right now is get the right people in the house and get Trump out. Biden will follow suit if the right people are in the house. Who knows if he’ll even last a term😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PROPHETE_XV In regards to Hillary, she didn’t excite enough people.I think. We are currently repeating history,it’s too late to get people excited about a third party right now unfortunately.Trump is anti green, we do know that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PROPHETE_XV Electoral colleges are shit, I keep saying I agree. He could have won Florida without Nader. It was so close. It’s hypothetical, but most likely possible. Florida gave election to Bush.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PROPHETE_XV I sent you an article showing how 3rd parties have swayed elections, electoral is shit... but why play whatabouts right before the election. Do what you can, focus on Senate and Congress. They make the laws.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PROPHETE_XV Furthermore, Biden needs as many votes as he can get. A message needs to be sent to Trump so that he goes away. Best action right now is to get Green candidates in Senate and Congress. They make the laws anyways.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PROPHETE_XV  https://t.co/BxXTdlxiHC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PROPHETE_XV I sent a response. If you look at history, you clearly see where a third party has swayed elections. I’m not against third parties, but We know what we are getting with Trump and it’s completely in the wrong direction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PROPHETE_XV @MeidasTouch @HowieHawkins Don’t get me wrong, strengthening a third party might be necessary in future elections, but it’s too late for this election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PROPHETE_XV @MeidasTouch @HowieHawkins I agree, the electoral college isn’t ideal. Here’s an interesting article that goes over how third parties have influenced our elections. Gore very well could have won Florida  https://t.co/BxXTdlOTza<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PROPHETE_XV @MeidasTouch @HowieHawkins I agree 💯. Under different circumstances I might be pushing for a 3rd candidate. I just keep remembering Gore VS Bush. This would be a completely different world if Gore had won😕. This election is even more crucial.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PROPHETE_XV @MeidasTouch @HowieHawkins We can’t afford to do that. It’s too late to push a third candidate and it’s only going to help Trump.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realLBRTYorDTH @TalbertSwan @realDonaldTrump You guys are a cult that is being duped. That’s what history will show.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PoohBearVinny @Lovliny1 @bebe1969 I used to think that, until I realized so many are choosing to believe what they believe because it fits some Awful idea that they’ve already chosen to believe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realLBRTYorDTH @atMelsDiner @alexman_hdz @RyanAFournier Says the Trump worshipper😂🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@007Pete @atMelsDiner @alexman_hdz @RyanAFournier It was exactly deflection😂 and a nod to pretty much everything you hear come out of Trump’s mouth. How do you not see this???? So blinded by a cult.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayBoo1980 @atMelsDiner @alexman_hdz @RyanAFournier It was a tribute to Trump’s words😂 this is great. You guys are such idiots. Replace the words “con man” with something else and you pretty much have a verbatim transcript of something Trump has said😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trace73432009 @alexman_hdz @RyanAFournier I’m not the president of the United States committing crimes😏 nice try though<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@007Pete @atMelsDiner @alexman_hdz @RyanAFournier Yes, Q is full of them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DDDEOOOO @TheNobleWard @alexman_hdz @RyanAFournier The Q is full of 💩. Another scam.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atMelsDiner @alexman_hdz @RyanAFournier He’s exposing that he’s a con man. Biggest con man the world has ever seen. No other con man has done what he’s been able to do. No other president has been able to con like Trump. Nixon tried, but Trump is a better con. Don the Con.only thing he’s good at.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Silverthorn111 @RyanAFournier Could be Kevin Spacey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexman_hdz @RyanAFournier Trump isn’t innocent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mertlewoodOre @emmjay173 @SpeakUpNoworNev Nope. That’s your victim mentality twisting what I’ve said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mertlewoodOre @emmjay173 @SpeakUpNoworNev You’ve got a victim mentality thing going on. You should work that out, you’d be a much happier person. Trying to help you out man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mertlewoodOre @emmjay173 @SpeakUpNoworNev So defensive, lighten up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mertlewoodOre @emmjay173 @SpeakUpNoworNev Project mych? Is that something you read on the Q? 😏<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mark_place @PattyResists Following<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mertlewoodOre @emmjay173 @SpeakUpNoworNev I’m just calling you out for what you are doing not berating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mertlewoodOre @UnitedAsOne2020 @Vermont2 @SpeakUpNoworNev Yup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Homeoffree61 Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mertlewoodOre @UnitedAsOne2020 @Vermont2 @SpeakUpNoworNev Yeah. That’s how you come off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mertlewoodOre @emmjay173 @SpeakUpNoworNev Everyone keeps telling you Biden is working with Bernie. You only want to hear what you already believe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mertlewoodOre @emmjay173 @SpeakUpNoworNev I see we’re getting to the intelligent portion of this conversation 🙄 Confirms my original suspicions of why you’re on here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mertlewoodOre @SpeakUpNoworNev Green Party will not get enough votes. I’m sorry, but Dems might not even have enough much less a third party. Biden didn’t pick those candidates, but he has regretted his support. Anyone he actually picks won’t be as conservative as Trump’s.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mertlewoodOre @emmjay173 @SpeakUpNoworNev And getting the GP elected isn’t either. It’s just going to get the Anti-Bernie candidate elected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mertlewoodOre @Vermont2 @ZedStorm @UnitedAsOne2020 @SpeakUpNoworNev You forget there is a large part of America that hasn’t bought into this yet. Trump: brought to you by this kind of thinking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mertlewoodOre @UnitedAsOne2020 @Vermont2 @SpeakUpNoworNev Now you’re giving substance, before it did sound like you were just here to give whiny complaints for attention.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mertlewoodOre @emmjay173 @SpeakUpNoworNev The Dems did not get further right during the Obama administration 🤔 I think you forget we had an extremely right and difficult senate Obama had to deal with his second term.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PamS58 @mertlewoodOre @SpeakUpNoworNev Haha, great name! Also, thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylesmith19942 @CarolVanover @FoxNewsSunday Because he says so? Nope, that’s not how it works. Look at data, science and facts; juxtapose, look at history and how similar policies of the past have impacted us before. That’s all I’m gonna say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarolVanover @FoxNewsSunday Yeah, it’s called fact checking. Enough with Trump’s lies!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yeseniabonfigli @Justin12393LEE @realDonaldTrump Not even the US loves Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeyersPammi @Justin12393LEE @realDonaldTrump Could say the same for you😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Yes, because it sucks under this administration<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mertlewoodOre @SpeakUpNoworNev Do you think it’s your constant complaining that is making people think you’ve already made your decision so there’s no point in reasoning with you?You come across as obnoxious as well.I gave reasons 4 Biden. you came back with complaints about supporters🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bearbear0151 @Carymeaway1 @bevjohnny @mitchellvii Haha, now she is going to call you a Dramacrat😆 She’s trying time make it a thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mertlewoodOre @UnitedAsOne2020 @Vermont2 @SpeakUpNoworNev As I’ve stated before, your intentions are clear. You obviously never considered Biden. I just hope you’ve honestly looked at Biden’s policies and aren’t just throwing things out because you want attention or didn’t get your way. Trump=anti-Bernie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mertlewoodOre @UnitedAsOne2020 @Vermont2 @SpeakUpNoworNev It is your right to vote green, but if you care about Supreme Court appointees and if you line up more with one side (Trump is definitely not green and will be worse after the election), then I would urge you to carefully consider the effects of that vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mertlewoodOre @SpeakUpNoworNev Biden doesn’t have bro’s, that’s a Bernie term. All genders welcome. As for the Biden supporter, I wonder if they figured you have no intentions of voting for Biden anyways. Sometimes people’s intentions are more obvious than they think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mertlewoodOre @SpeakUpNoworNev Supreme Court nominations for start. I suggest you read Biden’s ideas/initiatives/plans but here’s something else:  https://t.co/KRCB5NxEPx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakUpNoworNev It’s sad. Biden is listening to Bernie and Bernie has endorsed Biden, yet we’re talking about how to get Bernie votes. It’s too bad Bernie voters don’t realize if they don’t vote for Biden they are voting for a man that is bad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Carymeaway1 This is actual fake news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Carymeaway1  https://t.co/otPUjcmpKY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Carymeaway1 @Glennumb @bevjohnny @mitchellvii Verified? 🤣😂 By whom? People on Q? 🤣😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Carymeaway1 @Glennumb @bevjohnny @mitchellvii Conspiracies are not truth without evidence. The lies and  manipulation that come from the Republicans are not truth. One day you will see the Q is wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Carymeaway1 @bevjohnny @Glennumb @mitchellvii No.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bevjohnny @Glennumb @mitchellvii Except your falsehoods are actually hurting the American people, but whatever. Have a good weekend😘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Glennumb @bevjohnny @mitchellvii Like the propaganda you find on Fox, OAN/ Trump’s twitter and the Q? You only think it’s propaganda because it isn’t a conspiracy 🤣  https://t.co/DZzBTaQSLC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AwakenedOutlaw @QStorm1111 Wicked cool!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aWaken4gd @mitchellvii Actually no, that’s not why Dems are fighting him with everything. Also, read the Bible. Seems like you might have missed some parts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bevjohnny @mitchellvii Where are you getting your information?!?🤣 You guys sound absolutely crazy when you say things like this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bevjohnny @mitchellvii He is the criminal, how do you not see this???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scebra @CoeusDr @realDonaldTrump I thought she was fabulous on Maddow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump As in the regulations that got us into trouble in 2008?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lilmissarcasm @flushednsticky 😂🤣exactly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@laurenthehough @nycgov 😂🤣 it’s fantastic. We’re normally forgotten or ignored and when we finally get attention, it’s not even us. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wendy_mcroberts @jaketapper Haha, I was thinking the same. We’re always getting left out 😂(thankfully) but the one time we get acknowledged it’s not even us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Voiceoverlady1 Hi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomKOdell @Le_petite_0494 @warren_wv I can do the same. Putting poorly  “photoshopped” photographs at a random island prove nothing. Have you been to Epstein’s island? I’m thinking you have.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@valerie94218300 @sassybworm @McmastersCarl @suzydymna @RealJamesWoods Sure, but the people who follow James Woods typically are hypocritical pigs. I’m just calling that out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomKOdell @Le_petite_0494 @warren_wv Conspiracy theories are likely to be more successful when they confirm what people want to believe🙄 You’ll only accept what already fits inside your small brain.

<|startoftext|>@sassybworm @McmastersCarl @suzydymna @RealJamesWoods You assume I’m talking about Trump😂 hahahahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sassybworm @McmastersCarl @suzydymna @RealJamesWoods It’s not an assumption 😏<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnTitor2030 @Sluggo_4_Prez @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump @nytimes I don’t have to assume😏 your responses tell me everything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnTitor2030 @Sluggo_4_Prez @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump @nytimes Exactly what a racist would say. You can’t even embrace other cultures. So sad. You don’t even get it. Probably why you never bothered to study where other countries are located.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fuckin_Mahar @Sluggo_4_Prez @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump @nytimes Yeah, I see you didn’t pay attention in English class either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnTitor2030 @Sluggo_4_Prez @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump @nytimes Are you trying to get rid of their Spanish heritage? I’m not surprised. Also, I still think you have no idea where Spain is without looking at a map. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sluggo_4_Prez @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump @nytimes By “they” I meant Trump. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnTitor2030 @Sluggo_4_Prez @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump @nytimes I bet you don’t even know where Spain is😂🤣 that was the whole point of my comment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sluggo_4_Prez @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump @nytimes So the founders are Spanish. The whole point was to make fun of Trump’s geography skills. A nod to past mishaps and racist comments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Can’t be worse than your pact with Russia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @GoyaFoods @GoyaFoods is going to tank once all your white supporters stop buying it up to give to the poor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GodfreyofBouil4 @Sluggo_4_Prez @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump @nytimes Did it upset you, because you seem pretty racist.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Gigigre30844164 @MRSullivan96 @NotMaryShelley @K_Darshea You both are getting boring, you’re obviously too full of yourselves, stuck on your views, and possibly lying about living here anyways, so there’s no point in having a serious conversation. Goodbye! Muting conversation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gigigre30844164 @MRSullivan96 @NotMaryShelley @K_Darshea How stupid is this tweet gonna be when it doesn’t age well😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gigigre30844164 @MRSullivan96 @NotMaryShelley @K_Darshea Seeing as how I’ve just been trolling you this whole time 😂 you’re just now picking up on that. Funny thing is you probably don’t see how poorly you come across.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MRSullivan96 @Gigigre30844164 @NotMaryShelley @K_Darshea “Who look like me”😆🤣 What does that have to do with anything? Maybe you’re not baiting😧 I know what’s going on! You’re racist! That’s why you like Trump! It makes sense. Classic projecting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gigigre30844164 @MRSullivan96 @NotMaryShelley @K_Darshea Not surprised you can’t pick up on humor😂 you assume I’m not a Brit.😝<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MRSullivan96 @Gigigre30844164 @NotMaryShelley @K_Darshea Unless you are Gigi🤔😃🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MRSullivan96 @Gigigre30844164 @NotMaryShelley @K_Darshea You and Gigi need to get together and live in Britain. Worry about politics over there, stop interfering ours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MRSullivan96 @Gigigre30844164 @NotMaryShelley @K_Darshea You assume I’m not Hispanic myself😂🤣 And yes you were baiting. Get off your high horse Brit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MRSullivan96 @Gigigre30844164 @NotMaryShelley @K_Darshea Why does it matter so much that I insinuated you were a catfish? Have you even tried to get to know me? Do you even care to know me? No. I asked you genuine questions and your response was arrogant 😂 like a Brit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gigigre30844164 @MRSullivan96 @NotMaryShelley @K_Darshea That doesn’t surprise me😏 but his baiting was no better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MRSullivan96 @Gigigre30844164 @NotMaryShelley @K_Darshea Like I don’t understand why you care so much what people think of you. You’re not helping your cause or any cause positively.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MRSullivan96 @Gigigre30844164 @NotMaryShelley @K_Darshea Exactly, so instead of calling people racist when that person didn’t even bring up race but joked about Florida’s ed system and Trump supporters you should read what they actually wrote. I was actually complimenting you😂 Note the word joke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gigigre30844164 @MRSullivan96 @NotMaryShelley @K_Darshea You talk a lot about being a good person... 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gigigre30844164 @MRSullivan96 @NotMaryShelley @K_Darshea Thank you, this proves my point that you are no different 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MRSullivan96 @Gigigre30844164 @NotMaryShelley @K_Darshea And you don’t think your side does the same? Calling us names like libtards, snowflakes etc? Making fun of us and telling us we’re wrong for wanting to protest women’s rights, social justice, gun reform?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MRSullivan96 @NotMaryShelley @Gigigre30844164 @K_Darshea I think you missed the point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MRSullivan96 @Gigigre30844164 @NotMaryShelley @K_Darshea Why do you assume liberals don’t think for themselves? I don’t understand why you keep saying you think for yourself as if liberals don’t . We do.  Is that a defense mechanism on your part?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gigigre30844164 @MRSullivan96 @NotMaryShelley @K_Darshea This doesn’t even make sense😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MRSullivan96 @Gigigre30844164 @NotMaryShelley @K_Darshea I’m not upset😂🤣 I’m amused that you expect us to believe you’re not a catfish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gigigre30844164 @MRSullivan96 @NotMaryShelley @K_Darshea #sarcasm 😂 you didn’t get the dictionary that shows the definition of racism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MRSullivan96 @Gigigre30844164 @NotMaryShelley @K_Darshea Also, your comprehension sucks. I was specifically referring to Trump supporters and Florida’s education system. 😂 stop trying to make something into something else catfish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MRSullivan96 @Gigigre30844164 @NotMaryShelley @K_Darshea Wow, a person who automatically assumes I’m a guy #sexist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gigigre30844164 @MRSullivan96 @NotMaryShelley @K_Darshea Against the Floridian Educational system and Trump supporters??? You’re obviously not from here and don’t understand Florida’s Ed system is a long running joke. It’s not unreasonable for me to question if this guy is a #catfish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gigigre30844164 @MRSullivan96 @NotMaryShelley @K_Darshea Wow, another person who has no idea what they are talking about 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sosa_barboza @MRSullivan96 @aRay_uvlights @RCamposDuffy @SaraCarterDC @JulianCastro Haha this guy isn’t a cholo, he’s a Brit pretending to be a Hispanic American so that he can be a part of the conversation 😂 #Catfish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MRSullivan96 @misternixx @haroldmapr @K_Darshea Doesn’t change the fact that Trump is a conman<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MRSullivan96 @NotMaryShelley @K_Darshea Well since you’re British pretending to be something else😂...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MRSullivan96 @NotMaryShelley @K_Darshea Don’t get all snowflake😂 it is what it is. Florida has a reputation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MRSullivan96 @NotMaryShelley @K_Darshea See that makes it even more suspicious 😂 you’re a Floridian Trump supporter that writes legibly and prefers to use British spellings? I don’t think it’s ridiculous that we’re questioning this😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MRSullivan96 @NotMaryShelley @K_Darshea Na Bro, You could get any old picture off the internet. That’s all I’m saying, but your writing says you’re Brit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MRSullivan96 @NotMaryShelley @K_Darshea Yes. We don’t know if that’s your real picture or name, but we know you spell like a Brit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotMaryShelley @MRSullivan96 @K_Darshea Good catch!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PanevVasko @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump Like the republicans who are hurting others by boycotting masks and carrying guns to protests like a gun can kill corona🙄?

<|startoftext|>@EconomicPrison1 @BudHolladay @michaelharriot She was going off about how Obama didn’t do anything for blacks. I sent over a list of his accomplishments. It didn’t do anything. She did, however, tell me I “sound black” as if it was some negative thing. I wouldn’t bother with her. She doesn’t care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BudHolladay @EconomicPrison1 @michaelharriot Only when I see your handle. I call it  as it is. I appreciate that you see is as thinkers😏 I know you certainly aren’t talking about yourself.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BudHolladay @legallybae @BillyBoysDaddy And before you come back with “of course it’s Obama’s site” look up the information. It’ll check true, unlike the crap Trump tweets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BudHolladay @legallybae @BillyBoysDaddy Sending this to you is useless because I know you already have a narrative you want to believe. But here is just one of many.

<|startoftext|>@IssacRojas17 @SpawnOfDanelaw @legallybae 🤔 one book? You come across as an idiot so I was reluctant, but the first book actually looks pretty interesting so thanks for the recommendation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackIrishI @legallybae @DBTayor Yet you send me Red State articles. #StoptheLies #StopTheMadness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackIrishI @legallybae @DBTayor Yup. To your detriment, I learned how to use reliable sources 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IssacRojas17 @SpawnOfDanelaw @legallybae Awe, did I bruise your ego?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IssacRojas17 @SpawnOfDanelaw @legallybae Haha, you know nothing about me. And now I know your expertise on psychology consists of reading some pop psychology books😂 let me guess, Dr. Phil?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IssacRojas17 @SpawnOfDanelaw @legallybae Nope, I said more of an anatomy term. Nice try though😏<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IssacRojas17 @SpawnOfDanelaw @legallybae Ummm😂 Amygdala is a part of your brain. Not a psych term, more of an anatomy term. And the study was technically Biopsychology<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackIrishI @legallybae @DBTayor U have no proof. For all you know it was KKK. I don’t know many liberal racists, but I sure know a lot of republican ones.

<|startoftext|>@BlackIrishI @legallybae @DBTayor It was, and you have no proof a Democrat did it🙄 it makes more sense if it was a racist given the date it happened. Typical trump sheep, always relying on each other and leaving out facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grim_prime @legallybae Yes.  https://t.co/xxmr5CyW0M<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BudHolladay @legallybae @BillyBoysDaddy Oh man, you really should look up the data and stop relying on Fox and Trump’s a Twitter to feed you what you want to hear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IssacRojas17 @SpawnOfDanelaw @legallybae Ah, but listening to the W is not rational. There is actually science to back up that you guys are amygdala driven.  https://t.co/47l1R9DDXa<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@snarkazoid @JulianOgalde @Nate_McMurray If a job chooses to let go of a person because of their poor judgement/ racist actions/ uncivilized behavior that will hurt business, that is the jobs choice.

<|startoftext|>@jb9014 @ANYAGV2 😏and there it is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jb9014 @ANYAGV2 I saw you retweeted James Woods and I put you into a category<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jb9014 @ANYAGV2 No 😀, sorry I quickly called you a Narcissist only because you were only seeing one side. That was a dumb reaction from me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ANYAGV2 @jb9014 My point is if people want to report him to Twitter it is their free speech. Twitter gets to decide if it violates their terms or not. Now if Trump tried to shut Twitter down because of what people said, that would be different 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ANYAGV2 @jb9014 1) stoners can be narcissists, not sure what your point is🙄 the fact that he dropped this convo shows that he probably isn’t (Just selfish) , but that’s not the point you made.  2) I disagree with you, but nevertheless Twitter isn’t a gov agency🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Sam8585 @lyndacinwa @iamwhoi84512680 @GovRonDeSantis You obviously haven’t been reading the research😂 also, you got a lot of attention for whining and lying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sam8585 @TrepayneL @GovRonDeSantis You are blaming a group of people with little to no evidence. I wish you could go to the beach so that you’d spend less time watching Fox.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sam8585 @ClearandPresen2 @GovRonDeSantis Inevitable? Some countries have proven otherwise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sam8585 @maeh3m @GovRonDeSantis Why don’t you take the advice of the background picture you posted on your profile😂 “be thankful, stop complaining “<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YellingatNo1 @Sam8585 @JUConnor25 @GovRonDeSantis 😂 she’s so fake😂😬 her profile background says “be thankful, stop complaining “<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sam8585 @sstopshere @JUConnor25 @GovRonDeSantis You should research😂 the virus doesn’t spread as easily outdoors. Even less with a mask. It’s not protesters, but the restaurants and bars on the beaches. Fox should be telling you to blame the governor, not the protesters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sam8585 @JUConnor25 @GovRonDeSantis You are clearly blaming protesters for the incompetence of the leaders. Perhaps you should look at the science and numbers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sam8585 @GovRonDeSantis Yes, the side that whines and blames protesters for closing their beach/ (insert whatever else)  when science shows that wearing masks and being outdoors keeps covid from spreading significantly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sam8585 @GovRonDeSantis Way to deflect, did you learn that from Trump? You were whining and blaming protesters the beach closing. I called you out and said it most likely was the people you defend, not protesters. P.S. there are bars and restaurants on the beaches. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sam8585 @GovRonDeSantis You were obviously trying to blame protesters for the mistakes your side has made🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bjyphillips @Cathygraphics1 @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump My whole family watched because we wanted to see Trump’s next big gaffe. We have no intention of voting for him.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CarlbergElena @JustBeaTee Keep in mind, they might have more testing so numbers will be up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustBeaTee You have to remember, much of the rise is from Memorial Day. Texans know how to party, unfortunately so did Covid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustBeaTee The obsession with Texas is that the cases are rising rapidly. Hospitals in some places are at capacity. The trend looks bad if you look at the science. In regards to marches, many wore masks and it was outdoors. Big difference from indoors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anleehil @JustBeaTee 1) there was a peep 2) many were wearing mask 3) everyone was outdoors and research shows (or at least did) that the virus doesn’t spread as easily outdoors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarlbergElena @JustBeaTee It’s hospital capacity that’s a problem for some places and it’s  the sharp rise and trends that’s a problem. You have to look at all of the data when you make big decisions.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HeidyTL @Miro35231818 @JoeBiden It’s not Biden, but you’re right. I was reading Jane Doe vs Trump/Epstein case. Trumps had a ridiculous amount of sexual misconduct charges against him. So sad.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WeAreTrump2020 @lindajt33 @SteveGuest 1) You most definitely were playing a victim😀. 2) Pfft, even if you are a Dr who can diagnose, you’re ridiculous to think Trump is mentally healthy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichieFed 1) it doesn’t sound like she has a breathing problem  2) What Dr okay’d her to go out in public without a mask when she has a breathing problem?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ideadali @daviddave111 @RealJamesWoods To you “thinking for yourselves” means soaking in conspiracies and coming up with reasons for why they might be true. It’s a process often void of sound facts and data.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeAreTrump2020 @lindajt33 @SteveGuest Like Fox does? Stop playing the victim. It doesn’t look good on the president when he does it and it doesn’t look good on you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MrsMom2_2 @Jakeh7519 @SheWhoShinesOn @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump That doesn’t change that you accused her of lying about rape. Courts didn’t say that... that’s from your mouth. In fact, some could say you actually compared her to a dog. That’s pretty sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joe_H96 @PsychoSix @lindajt33 @SteveGuest You’re just upset that he sounded like an actual president. I guess he could have his people tell everyone that he was just joking, or even better make up some story to make it seem true. I’ve heard sharpies work for this kinda think too 😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CapitalisticPig @TrumpWarRoom We could say the EXACT same thing about Trump. Instead of apologizing for his gaffes though Trump takes sharpies and/or creates bigger lies. His people have to cover for him and say he was just kidding, shortly before Trump admits he wasn’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeAreTrump2020 @lindajt33 @SteveGuest Have you not paid attention to what comes out of Trump’s mouth? At least Biden corrects himself😂Trump just takes sharpies to things and creates bigger lies when he gaffes. Or his people lie and just say it was a joke🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoPublicPension @lindajt33 @SteveGuest Are you talking about Trump?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GreyYanyo @lindajt33 @SteveGuest That IS what’s running the country. Check Trump’s history with sexual misconduct . It’s so bad. You’ll also see he was closer to Epstein than he let on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PsychoSix @lindajt33 @SteveGuest And how many times have Trump’s people had to cover him by saying he was just kidding or didn’t mean to lie or say (insert stupid, criminal or awful) thing? Yeah...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrsMom2_2 @Jakeh7519 @SheWhoShinesOn @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump I didn’t present the document. But even if I had, you didn’t address the document validity. You only accused someone of lying about being raped. That’s all.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@vincent_hi @SuzanneCuster2 @Guardian23B @HKrassenstein @BarackObama @JoeBiden Yeah, I stopped watching them when Obama said the same. However, Trumps lies aren’t really an opinion. A lie is a lie😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@vincent_hi @SuzanneCuster2 @Guardian23B @HKrassenstein @BarackObama @JoeBiden Doesn’t mean it’s wrong.

<|startoftext|>@vincent_hi @SuzanneCuster2 @Guardian23B @HKrassenstein @BarackObama @JoeBiden Is that the conspiracies faux news pushed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vincent_hi @SuzanneCuster2 @Guardian23B @HKrassenstein @BarackObama @JoeBiden That’s always the go to with you guys 😏Oh, the science or data doesn’t agree with my preconceived ideas, it’s false. It lists actual lies Trump has said. If you look at them, unless you’re an idiot, you can see how they are set up to divide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vincent_hi @SuzanneCuster2 @Guardian23B @HKrassenstein @BarackObama @JoeBiden She was under investigation for a LONG time. And nothing came up. Wasted money, wasted time. Poor woman. How many of Donald Trump’s people were convicted? Trump committed an impeachable offense, but the senate bailed him out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vincent_hi @SuzanneCuster2 @Guardian23B @HKrassenstein @BarackObama @JoeBiden I mean, just look at the lies he tells.  https://t.co/ietzsnyr7M<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vincent_hi @SuzanneCuster2 @Guardian23B @HKrassenstein @BarackObama @JoeBiden Hilary shouldn’t have called Trump supporters deplorable, even if what you all were saying about her was absolutely deplorable. Trump knows that as long as you guys are fired up he has a chance of winning, so he absolutely divides.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamTheeMaan @RetiredMaybe 😂 I just said the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@motherbaus Just out of curiosity, who would you report to?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vincent_hi @SuzanneCuster2 @Guardian23B @HKrassenstein @BarackObama @JoeBiden In regards to protests and statues,  if you look at history you’ll see the people on the right side did similar actions. They aren’t hurting anyone (not talking about looters or any violent people). Some of the violent people are actually trumpers. So...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vincent_hi @SuzanneCuster2 @Guardian23B @HKrassenstein @BarackObama @JoeBiden Possibly 😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vincent_hi @SuzanneCuster2 @Guardian23B @HKrassenstein @BarackObama @JoeBiden Oh, there are other studies😀 and it’s just getting started. I wonder if they’ll do a study just on the trumpers that threaten to bring their guns on everyone. Pretty violent if you ask me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vincent_hi @SuzanneCuster2 @Guardian23B @HKrassenstein @BarackObama @JoeBiden And you don’t think this one proves them right either? 🤔 interesting 😏<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@vincent_hi @SuzanneCuster2 @Guardian23B @HKrassenstein @BarackObama @JoeBiden She clearly stated she’s  talking about people who refuse to wear masks and mind social distancing when in public. Also, there is a difference between people outdoors with masks, vs indoors without masks. Look it up.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TriaPapaPia @kramsauer73 @145Mainstreet @_ReaalAmerican_ @realDonaldTrump You would know.

<|startoftext|>@kramsauer73 @TriaPapaPia @145Mainstreet @_ReaalAmerican_ @realDonaldTrump Too much to list but Historically the economy does better under a Democrat.

<|startoftext|>@TriaPapaPia @TheCakeIsALie44 @_ReaalAmerican_ @realDonaldTrump The ones who have apologized because unlike you, they grew up? Yes, they are pretty funny.

<|startoftext|>@Krisann87745748 @RanttMedia @GOP “Please pick up a book on the civil war“ not a very nice comment. Very hypocritical . Also, you might want to brush up on American history post civil war before you make comments like that. 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RGML2012 @cruisetravelby1 @EstherFGPatriot @BrandonStraka You are so blind you don’t even look at actual statistics before running your mouth.

<|startoftext|>@Krisann87745748 @realTrumpForce @realDonaldTrump You sure do judge a lot😂 you’ve already made so many assumptions and all I did was say that Trump was the anti Christ. He has claimed he’s the chosen one... so...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sjb61335 @dljr2018 @BrandonStraka I’m not sure what you are asking. People are ignorant on the topic and are getting misinformation. That’s the first problem that needs to be solved. Then lowering incidents of racism, police brutality and injustice follows. I sent info, now it’s up to you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjb61335 @dljr2018 @BrandonStraka My personal goal is to give information to those that want it and to annoy those that want to keep spreading manipulated data and sound bites that are hurting the movement. There are a lot of people justifying and refusing to see there is a prob.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjb61335 @dljr2018 @BrandonStraka From a Christian perspective? Political? Societal? It’s nuanced for sure on all aspects. People will have to come together to work on solution. The first problem is wanting to hide that there is a problem. Data has shown for years there is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjb61335 @dljr2018 @BrandonStraka It’s about brain patterns in the two ideologies. Interesting study.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjb61335 @dljr2018 @BrandonStraka See you tomorrow!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjb61335 @dljr2018 @BrandonStraka Thank you! You are making me see MAGATs in a different light. As rational people who are willing to use their entire brain. I guess that scientific study done on conservatives and liberals was wrong.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sjb61335 @dljr2018 @BrandonStraka I’m just so glad that you are not one of those ridiculous Trump zombies feeding your ego and shielding your belief system with Right generated lies and sound bites. FINALLY, a MAGAT that wants to be educated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@czarofwonder @EstherFGPatriot @BrandonStraka Is there a reason Decades in Broadcasting is capitalized? Also, they are two different medias. Writing is not your forte obviously. You sound unstable/drunk when you write😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjb61335 @dljr2018 @BrandonStraka I just sent you literature. Now it’s your job to actually read it and make decisions for yourself. That’s what I did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjb61335 @dljr2018 @BrandonStraka More education:  https://t.co/n46orKFSKO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjb61335 @dljr2018 @BrandonStraka For education, since you asked:  https://t.co/Po7rn1Ukh7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjb61335 @dljr2018 @BrandonStraka These are good starter books<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjb61335 @dljr2018 @BrandonStraka  https://t.co/bu8Cmol1Pk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sjb61335 @dljr2018 @BrandonStraka Thank you for taking an interest in being educated. Here are some books to help you understand the other side. I was raised on your thinking, these opened my eyes:  https://t.co/k8RrZeupS2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@b70663858 @HnieJo @BrandonStraka Did. You you really cared, you’d get off Twitter with strangers. Reconnect with your black friends, find out how they are doing and see their perspective. The easy thing to do is believe a narrative that only protects your ego.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DLKBelieve @cruisetravelby1 @EstherFGPatriot @BrandonStraka And don’t forget, Obama was constantly having to go up against the Republican senate who was constantly  trying to block him. Stop believing liars.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@b70663858 @HnieJo @BrandonStraka Familiar with them. I’m guessing from your response, I’m correct. I encourage you to become friends with black people. I don’t mean aquatinted, I mean friends<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@b70663858 @HnieJo @BrandonStraka You wouldn’t be saying what you say<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@czarofwonder @EstherFGPatriot @BrandonStraka It’s not current events I’m having trouble with, it’s your incomprehensible text😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@czarofwonder “Yes” 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@czarofwonder 😂 I was talking about books, were you talking about opinion pieces?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@czarofwonder @EstherFGPatriot @BrandonStraka Statues of Quaker torn down proves you don’t know?? 🤣 what does that even mean. Are you drunk right now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@czarofwonder It’s funny you said read a book and educate yourself, I could recommend quite a few to you if you were open enough to take your own advice. Doubt it though😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@czarofwonder It’s not my job, but I did get A’s in my Master level statistics class🤔 you don’t need A’s or a Masters or even a job in the field. Really, you just have to read reliable sources in whole. Look at the whole picture, and educate yourself in basic concepts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HnieJo @BrandonStraka I mean this in the sincerest way, and I’m sorry, but I think the educational system failed you as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@czarofwonder @EstherFGPatriot @BrandonStraka BLM isn’t a person🙄🙄😖 you can’t say BLM doesn’t care😖 the movement is about changing Undeniable statistics. It’s about fixing a problem that exists whether or not you turn the other way. This has been a problem for years. Enough!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@czarofwonder @EstherFGPatriot @BrandonStraka You are just looking at a piece, plain numbers, not percentages as a whole. It’s not my job to school you. You can’t just take one piece and run with it. You have to look at the whole picture🙄 otherwise you’re just manipulating data for ur needs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HnieJo @BrandonStraka The real issue is people denying systemic racism exists. People twisting numbers and facts to fit their narratives. You said the real issue is black on black, have you even tried to think about why that’s even an issue?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@b70663858 @HnieJo @BrandonStraka You obviously don’t have very many black friends in real life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HnieJo @b70663858 @BrandonStraka Are you kidding??? Trump has been slowly taking back all of the progress we made during the last admin. Did you not see what he did on the anniversary of the Pulse shooting? Are you a liar, or hiding under a rock?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EstherFGPatriot @BrandonStraka You’re convincing yourself that this is true so that you don’t have to face that you’re a horrible person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dljr2018 @BrandonStraka Again, learn to read statistics and reliable sources. It’s not my job to school you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dljr2018 @BrandonStraka 1) learn to read statistics and reliable sources. It’s not my job to school you fools. 2) If it’s not a problem, why is trump working on an exec order for police reform? 😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HnieJo @BrandonStraka Then why is Trump putting an executive order on police reform?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dljr2018 @BrandonStraka Learn how to read statistics. Otherwise you just sound racist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cruisetravelby1 @EstherFGPatriot @BrandonStraka Black people don’t need these protests to realize racist people like you exist and are sheep to the republicans. Your racist leader has been very open about where he stands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MelanieDuff4 @BrandonStraka It’s not facts that liberals get annoyed at, it’s the way republicans twist the facts for your own narrative that get us frustrated<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@un_coeur_dhomme @504DaveMills @Bylyam1 @realDonaldTrump @LuisBobby3 Trump was a major player in that movement to prove Obama wasn’t American. Breitbart, Fox and Alt News helped to push that. Democrats are not innocent, but I can’t say Obama created the division. It was the culture, money and outlets that promoted it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@un_coeur_dhomme @504DaveMills @Bylyam1 @realDonaldTrump @LuisBobby3 Furthermore, after 911 a distrust in our government grew. Racism has always been there, but certain news outlets and social media was pushing Muslims as the enemy. Those same outlets were trying to scare people by saying Obama was a Muslim.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@un_coeur_dhomme @504DaveMills @Bylyam1 @realDonaldTrump @LuisBobby3 There were a lot of rich Republicans that put money behind    getting Democrats out. That, paired with Fox News (Roger Ails), Alex Jones, etc pushing agendas, played a big part of the division and hate for Obama.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@un_coeur_dhomme @504DaveMills @Bylyam1 @realDonaldTrump @LuisBobby3 Ah, my apologies, I assumed you were in here just trying to get reactions from people.

<|startoftext|>@CoLdAsIcE82 @JoeK3Fan @Kristi_26280921 @Vtalksalot @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump Are you just saying things because you think they prove your point and sound good? That’s not a strong testimony for your ability to think for yourself<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CoLdAsIcE82 @JoeK3Fan @Kristi_26280921 @Vtalksalot @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump You’re saying that because of his profile pic, did it bother you that much? Also, please do not call people names right before bringing God into it😬 bad for religion.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CoLdAsIcE82 @JoeK3Fan @Kristi_26280921 @Vtalksalot @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump Unless you are ABSOLUTElY correct or even have scientific evidence by legitimate sources saying masks are useless, you are being selfish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoLdAsIcE82 @JoeK3Fan @Kristi_26280921 @Vtalksalot @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump I never said I believed that. On another note, are you okay?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoLdAsIcE82 @JoeK3Fan @Kristi_26280921 @Vtalksalot @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump No legitimate person said everyone who got it would die. Whomever did lied or you’re just pulling crap out of nowhere.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CoLdAsIcE82 @JoeK3Fan @Kristi_26280921 @Vtalksalot @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump And either way, no matter how you spin it... unless you are ABSOLUTELY sure this is and all science behind wearing masks are a big conspiracy, your beliefs are selfish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoLdAsIcE82 @JoeK3Fan @Kristi_26280921 @Vtalksalot @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump Rhetorical question<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoLdAsIcE82 @JoeK3Fan @Kristi_26280921 @Vtalksalot @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump Did you read the full story? How do you know it wasn’t a lovers quarrel?  Will you believe it’s a conspiracy if the university publishes his work like they say they will, or will you still hold on to your theory because your brain is wired to?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoLdAsIcE82 @JoeK3Fan @Kristi_26280921 @Vtalksalot @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump Exactly, so why are you believing conspiracies?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoLdAsIcE82 @Kristi_26280921 @Vtalksalot @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump So you ignore best practices, History, data and science and knowledge that has been around for years??? Fighting to start the economy is one thing, throwing a fit by refusing to wear a mask is something else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoLdAsIcE82 @Kristi_26280921 @Vtalksalot @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump But you will never see that, because you’ve already been wired to believe the narrative that you believe, a narrative that will hurt the economy and kill so many more just so your crooked president and republicans can stay in power. Read history.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoLdAsIcE82 @Kristi_26280921 @Vtalksalot @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump Actually, you are being conditioned to believe propaganda and conspiracy theories created by people of your political party over science, best practices and data.

<|startoftext|>@bethanyshondark What’s the point? You’re just gonna kill them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bethanyshondark @SethAMandel Wait, you are upset because the government is putting people on lockdown to help slow down a virus (based on the best science and practice we have), but your are okay with a husband controlling a wife?!?! Sick psycho woman<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@eponawest @bethanyshondark Exactly!!!! These people are so weak. I would say They are going to succumb to Darwinism, but unfortunately these morons are going to take doctors, teachers and nurses as well. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bethanyshondark Do you always give up in life and fall victim to your feelings this easily?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nomadforjustice She had been his ally the entire time. Taking hits and when his supporters became jerks, he not only lied but didn’t do anything to make things right.  https://t.co/RAQlN2al9a<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nomadforjustice When she called him out on stage about his not thinking a woman could be president comment he flat out lied. He later had the plan to mince words, like “against trump”,he She tried to talk to him about his awful supporters and the conversation was short.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nomadforjustice Bernie was a snake to Warren and Bernie bros were a$$holes as well. Soooo I hope she has more integrity<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LegacyZeroYT @ewarren Nope, trump needs Warren to endorse Bernie. That’s about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamie_agust Warren has a lot of centrist voters that won’t end up with bernie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sharokh_mirzai A lot of warrens voters are moderates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CANCEL_SAM Many of Buttigieg’s and Klobuchars  candidates will go to Warren before they consider bernie. That says something<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EclecticRadical Because she’s a better candidate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrotherJeffery Add Biden and Buttigieg and you’ve got more people than Bernie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StickToPizza @reallyjlu @KildayMorgan @ss Are you always on Twitter? 😀 Are you okay?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StickToPizza @reallyjlu @KildayMorgan What does Bernie’s @ss look like😏 scratch that, I don’t really care. Oh hey, you know who else doesn’t care? Bernie about How he’s going to accomplish his vague policies. #Bern lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StickToPizza @reallyjlu @KildayMorgan He uses a lot of Trump tactics. Open your eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StickToPizza @reallyjlu @KildayMorgan Hahahahaha, are you always on Twitter? Bros are the people Trump supporters have been talking about😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StickToPizza @reallyjlu @KildayMorgan The information isn’t false and will be exemplified in the general. If you weren’t so brainwashed by your candidate you’d see that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StickToPizza @reallyjlu @KildayMorgan I can’t support such a divisive figure is what I’m saying. Bros are reinforcing this message.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StickToPizza @reallyjlu @KildayMorgan Yeah, I feel strongly that bros are going to spoil the election again. It’ll be all Trump supporter focused in the general, unless Bernie is the candidate. Then it might be a different story, except bros are kinda making it worse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StickToPizza @reallyjlu @KildayMorgan So blinded by your boner for Bernie. #bonerforbernie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StickToPizza @reallyjlu @KildayMorgan Oh hi bro, it’s you again. I can’t take you seriously because you are obviously one of those bros.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reallyjlu @KildayMorgan @StickToPizza Warren is just as progressive, appeals to more of the masses and has a better record of being effective. I genuinely haven’t picked a candidate yet, but she’s a strong consideration for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reallyjlu @KildayMorgan @StickToPizza Also check out what he wrote about women and rape. It was a long time ago, but disturbing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reallyjlu @KildayMorgan @StickToPizza He doesn’t practice what he preaches. Also, thanks for not being a jerk in your response.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reallyjlu @KildayMorgan @StickToPizza this is what’s going to come up if he gets the nomination. There is actually truth to it. I’m not a conservative, but looked into it.  https://t.co/TNB0eWkMzh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theoc2ps @People4Bernie @PeteButtigieg Thats not what he was saying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reallyjlu @KildayMorgan @StickToPizza Please tell me who this good, honest politician is, because I know it isn’t Bernie Sanders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@posting_malone @EricMorisset @Grave_Savings @b_our_selves @QueenInYeIIow Okay. Do you know this from personal experience?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HaroldPenisman @Grave_Savings @b_our_selves @QueenInYeIIow Do you understand how the internet works? You said undecided voters are morons.

<|startoftext|>@posting_malone @Grave_Savings @b_our_selves @QueenInYeIIow Oh, I don’t have plans... so not sure what you’re talking about. You sound angry though, maybe you should talk to someone IRL about that, like a counselor or Psych<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elfbread420 @EricMorisset @Grave_Savings @b_our_selves @QueenInYeIIow I mean Bernie is the one being supported by Russia, so you could very well be a bot<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HaroldPenisman @JoeBidenStan1 @Grave_Savings @b_our_selves @QueenInYeIIow you Bernie supporters are way to paranoid. Reminds me of Trump supporters. Interesting, Russia is involved with helping both those candidates<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoeBidenStan1 @Grave_Savings @b_our_selves @QueenInYeIIow Well speaking of sexual revolution, have you read Bernie’s rape fantasies? The guy is sick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grave_Savings @b_our_selves @QueenInYeIIow I see now you are one of those Sanders people that are going to give this election to Trump. That’s unfortunate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grave_Savings @b_our_selves @QueenInYeIIow You only believe that because you are rooting for another candidate and blinded by it. As someone who hasn’t picked a candidate yet, I can see what he actually meant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Entropy213 @starhungry @QueenInYeIIow You can be racist if you want to, but that’s not going to make this a better world.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Grave_Savings @b_our_selves @QueenInYeIIow You weren’t listening to the whole thing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoundOmega @sunraysunray I don’t understand why Bernie even shows to the debates. He just yells the same things over and over.<|endoftext|>
