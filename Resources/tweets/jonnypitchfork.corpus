<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant I don't know what you're so bitter about. Some people can't work from home, so there companies have put things in place to protect them, like your coop and bank example.

<|startoftext|>@XRPAshley @KateHF @AnthonyJohnG @SkyNews The camps are horrible, and things should be done about it no question.

<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant It's not saying that the police who stopped them are overtly racist. It's the systematic racism that is the problem.

<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant @pritipatel @BorisJohnson @Conservatives Because of the level of condemnation for the idiots at the BLM protest who acted violently. Priti Patel's use of langiage is already different talking about what happened yesterday to last week.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BrewCavern @BorisJohnson Nope wrong, you can only do what you want if you love your kid enough to break the rules...... Something like that, I think. Do I still have to stay alert?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulTonkinson @a_h_davies @mattforde Although I definitely lean to the left, I think this whole corona business is about us versus the virus and cummings behaviour has made that look like he doesn't give a shit. The uproar with this shouldnt be political (even though it will be), but what's right and wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulTonkinson @a_h_davies @mattforde Not all of them. I'm sure he has a few fans..... Not mentioning any political editors names.  His response to the media outside his house yesterday shows his views on the media, but also his ego which again won't sit well with some people.  Thanks for replying man!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulTonkinson @a_h_davies @mattforde He has played a blinder. Why get involved when everyone else is doing the work for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulTonkinson @a_h_davies @mattforde Good point. I think it depends on whether there is another story ready to go from the journalists who broke it. I'm sure all media outlets now will be all over this looking for another trip/outing etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulTonkinson @a_h_davies @mattforde You might be right, seeing as it's so far away. Depends on how Starmer deals with it, when the house opens again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulTonkinson @a_h_davies @mattforde Again, spot on. But surely this is giving all other parties huge ammo to use against Boris and the Tories?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulTonkinson @a_h_davies @mattforde You're spot on with opinions changing quickly though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulTonkinson @a_h_davies @mattforde The vast majority of people have stuck by the rules. Plus, it's hard to see past the 1 rule for them and 1 for us, seeing as he made the rules. If the Scottish CMO and the Sage member didn't have to fall on their swords also might have made a difference<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulTonkinson @a_h_davies @mattforde The families of the dead will, as will the families who lived by the rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rafaelordonez I know what you mean. He is holding them to account more than the bbc breakfast show I'd say. So much so, that they don't send ministers on to his show as they can't handle it. I'm sure normal service will resume soon enough<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EimearJude @DawnNeesom I had so much hope for this, and it has disappointed me throughout. Don't know if it's because I was going out there in the late 90s and it's doesn't represent it, or of its just bad writing. It's kind of like a late night Hollyoaks set in Ibiza<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant How do you really say 34k dead is fuck all? Compared to what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant Excess deaths up to 55k at least, so I'd love to see the source where the 35k is inflated. Plus I'd like to hear your replies to the other things I said. Where are the tests coming from? how often will they get tested?Why can't they debate things from home like they've been doing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant How are facts an excuse? If they aren't working, how has PMQ's ran the last few weeks? How was the immigration bill past this week? The fact is, they can work from home and don't need to be in the house<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant Especially when we are going to face the second wave, like you said will happen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant 2, why risk putting the people who make decisions about the running of the country in a confined, enclosed space (where the govt say is the most risky) when they can still debate from home?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant 1, 650 MP's, more in the house of Lords, plus the thousands of assistants to ensure the houses of Parliament can be open. How often do they get tested? Where do the tests come from? Especially when we can't get enough tests to care homes still.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant @odowdspace Adults acting like idiots in supermarkets should have no bearing on whether its safe for teachers to go back to work. Because of reduced class sizes, kids will only be going back once a week. What's the point, especially when the R rate is near 1 again. Why risk another spread?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant You mean they want to be safe? Teachers are being attacked in the media, because they can't go after doctors and nurses like they normally do..... But that day will come<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sueanneclarke @AdamBienkov I think Keir knows that certain areas of the press will do the digging needed. I think he found Johnson lacking in a number of areas.

<|startoftext|>Yas! This will be quality<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@munich_madrid @JLolley23 @mrjamesob @LBC This current situation is unprecedented. But depending on who you work for depends on how much you get paid, if you're ill or self isolating.

<|startoftext|>@antonydoyle My Friday plans at work have gone right out the window<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant @ThreeUK Nah, until now, they've been bang on. Never had another phone provider in all my years on being mobile in my telecommunications strategy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeUKSupport Yeah, I found out this week, I went through my statement and noticed two hg3 payments. Yes, an assistant last night cancelled it. He told me the people. I spoke to on the phone should/could help me try and retrieve the funds back when I originally called them<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is the stuff we all should be using twitter for #football #funnyvideos #twitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeUKSupport I was given a new sim because the phone used a smaller one (if I remember rightly) I very much doubt I have the paperwork as it was a phone contract I opened in 2015<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeUKSupport It was 3 years ago. I would have gone in after my mobile was due an upgrade and then the assistant would have done their thing. One thing I wouldnt have done is to renew before it was due to run out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeUKSupport Long story, but the short one is when I upgraded my phone 3 years ago, the old one wasn't cancelled. It took 2 visits to a shop and 3 phone calls to find this information out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Crap_Portraits Emilio Estervez<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThreeUK the service I have just recieved firstly from a shop and then from 2 calls to your service line is shocking, not because of the people I spoke to, but for your processes of what they can and can't do. Let's hope your systems are actually working next time I call<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant @realDonaldTrump You're right, but the repercussions are a little greater when you're a head of state. But I don't think they were really slagging him off, just pointing out what had happened, which the press have caught on tape. So yeah, it's the presses fault actually.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant @realDonaldTrump You know what, I agree with you. There is a time and a place. However, they are big boys and they should know the risks of slagging people off in a busy environment. I would just love to see his reaction and I'm surprised I've not read a tweet about it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't wait until @realDonaldTrump see's this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant Doesn't explain why you interacted so much with the tweet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant If you had retweeted Vine, you wouldn't be able to see the tweet on your time line as he would have deleted it. If you knew it was a parady, why reply under the tweet as well? Just admit you got fooled I didnt get done, I wanted to read the story, as it was of interest of me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant Yeah, it's the same meme maker that you got done by when you thought it was a guardian journalist. I had a look on it, pretty right wingy isn't it that web page isn't it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Otto_English You know its bad when Trump has been asked by Johnson not to talk about the election while he is here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant Would love to read this story. Have you got a link to it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant Funny that, we are currently the 5th largest economy in the world, but expected to drop two places with Brexit being an issue. Dont start that magic money tree bullshit, the tories have found billions from it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant Always comes back to manufacturing with you Fish. The benefit of being part of the largest trading block in the world was we didn't have to manufacture things. A hashtag does equate support. We don't make anything because everyone is lazy, including nurses<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes! I love this day. See which same 4 bands I've listened to on repeat in 2019 #SpotifyWrapped #Spotify #SPOTIFYPLAYLIST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant Not 100% sure, but scrapping Universal Credit and increasing minimum living wage to ¬£10 an hour might help. Who said I was voting Labour?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant 75 thousand people in thr East mids have had to rely on a 3 day food package. All of them lazy are they?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant Increased by 73%, so all of a sudden people have got lazy because Labour used to be in power and let foreigners in?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant Who said I think it will be solved? It won't be solved over night, but 9 years of austerity is killing people. The fact check says they can't confirm numbers, a bit different. But it does prove you were wrong to make a sweeping statement. In the last 5 years food bank use has...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant  https://t.co/t5PTI1k0s9 Fucking lazy nurses needing food backs and grants. Not working hard enough! Probably because they smoke and drink and buy tvs.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant 0 hour contracts have a place, but big businesses take the piss with them. There is little to no protection for the staff. It's the rich getting richer again.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant People are entitled to have kids Fisher. When yoh start tell people they can't you're living in a dictatorship. Stop them having kids, stop educating them, stop them using specific services, fuck em they don't need a car. Nice way of creating that slavery you're so against<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant Cheap labour equates to 0 hour contracts. It's a way of getting past minimum wage. Which has been the highest in our life time, especially with the introduction of living wage. You can't count modern day slavery as that is illegal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acid_lounge Them were the days, you knew who you were sitting next to. Could leave your front door open and nip to thr shops with out worry. #BringBackDoubleDeckers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant No only certain people in society should have kids? What next, only certain people can go to school or use a certain hospital. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant Modern day slavery is a total different subject. Especially seeing as around a third of people in slavery is in sexual exploitation. Wages are lower because large companies don't offer pay rises, or the government putting pay rises on a freeze for public service jobs.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@shumbamutasa Nah, I dont believe that. You can focus on what she says, how she says it and other behaviours. Things she can control, not her looks. If you concentrate on things she can't control; looks, race, gender then you're no better than she is #katiehopkins<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant @CHIMPSINSOCKS Last thing on the matter as I'm at home and want to cook food.  She literally had an audience with the UN. When you talk to the UN, you're talking to the world!  In a bit, speak soon üëä<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant @CHIMPSINSOCKS So she doesn't know what she is talking about then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant @CHIMPSINSOCKS So you are taking a pop at her, which you said you weren't. Is it because she is a girl or that she is young? As you don't have issues with David Attenborough  https://t.co/lhZeWVvXgs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant @CHIMPSINSOCKS You've moved from 'she is a pr machine' to 'she doesn't know what she is talking about' which one is it? I take it you show the same concern for David Attenborough the vulnerable oap.  https://t.co/KUgjibCTVO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant @CHIMPSINSOCKS I didn't fail to acknowledge anything, your comment didn't make any sense. Youve dived plenty of things. This stemmed from you having an issue with her,after I liked that fact she was taking the piss out of Trump. You're finding fault in a 16 year old who is trying to do good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant @CHIMPSINSOCKS People taking a pop because she speaks a little different, or that she is young. She has done shit loads to bring #climatechange to the forefront of politics and the media through more and more people challenging companies and governments. Why would anyone think that's bad?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant @CHIMPSINSOCKS That makes no sense. Who said the whole world has ruined her childhood? She is not talking to us when she speaks, she is talking to governments and their inactions, she is speaking to the 100 companies that make up 70% of emissions. I'm not even a fan of her, just don't like....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant @CHIMPSINSOCKS Except what she says, as she is backed up with facts about the climate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant @CHIMPSINSOCKS She is 16, she has a mind of her own, just like we did at that age. What she thinks she is doing is a good thing, talking about and getting other people talking about #climatechange the only thing she is overexposed to is people taking a pop at her, her autism and anything else..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant @CHIMPSINSOCKS I think it's common knowledge that her mum is an opera singer. Children will be conditioned by their parents and environment. So why is it 'brainwashing' with #GretaThunberg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant @CHIMPSINSOCKS What have you read/seen to make you think she is a puppet? She didn't seem like she had a pr machine behind her when she was protesting in Sweden on her own. Serious question<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@setoacnna @MascotMegaman @vi079 With your sweeping statements about the middle class is like me saying everyone with a Manchester bee as their picture is a cunt. You've convinced me, people shouldn't protest about climate change.... I'm off to set fire to some moorland and quicken up the process üëä<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@setoacnna @MascotMegaman @vi079 Ahhh, so only people who emit no CO2 can be concerned with climate change? Again though, this has nothing to do with your original post about them being middle class<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@setoacnna @MascotMegaman @vi079 What's that got to do with your original middle class claims? Only people from Mcr can protest in Mcr?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MascotMegaman @vi079 @setoacnna  https://t.co/r5UMWWs4WT proper glammed up in middle class posh clothing these lot. I stand corrected<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrainDiaries @KellyKinetik i bet this makes your toes curl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MascotMegaman @vi079 @setoacnna You're really good at not answering questions aren't you. You make statements and have nothing to back it up with. I've conceded that there is an issue with poverty, but that doesn't mean that the people in Mcr are middle class<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MascotMegaman @vi079 @setoacnna So therefore I'm not working class as I am concerned about climate change? Concern for the climate and people in dept are not mutually exclusive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MascotMegaman @vi079 @setoacnna I asked for definitions/descriptions of said clothes. Which I'm waiting for. I'm not unaware that more people are living in poverty and food bank requirements are stupid under the Tories. But you are implying all working class people are living under the poverty line.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MascotMegaman @vi079 @setoacnna No, you mentioned clothes. So what clothes do you have to wear to be working class? Is that not a bias you have created in your own mind/world? So am I right in saying you can only be concerned with one thing at a time if you're working class?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MascotMegaman @vi079 @setoacnna Again, I ask the question... Even if they aren't working class, what difference does that make. What sort of research did you do to categorise what clothes they were wearing. Just so I know, what clothes will make me working class/middle/upper?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vi079 @setoacnna All we can do Dave, is try and improve ourselves a little bit each day. If we all aimed to do that, the world would be a better place<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vi079 @setoacnna Not lofty Dave, just pointing out your predetermined biases are shaping your point of view.  P.s. Name isn't John üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vi079 @setoacnna Again, you can judge this by seeing people walk down the road. So because they have a car they should think 'fuck it, let the world burn'. You're not doing well here Dave<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vi079 @setoacnna Also, are 'middle class' people not allowed to be worried about the climate crisis? Only working class people should worry about the planet dying? Am I reading between the lines correctly Dave?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vi079 @setoacnna Ahhh, you're relying on your own conditions bias to judge people. That's good to know Dave<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vi079 @setoacnna That's a sweeping statement there Dave. Surely being so confident, you've clearly done some extensive research into this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sirbanwell @Mudney @Independent You're talking about two different things you're talking about.

<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant @jessthomas195 How do you think these "free clubs" could exist mate? Through grants and funding which has been cut massively<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant In general? Yes, of course it would have. Look at the good you do with the kids in cadets. How many of those could have got into crime if cadets weren't there to offer a positive influence in their life? Giving them a purpose and aspirations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant Of course they do. But when you're being influenced by people who are wanting youth to be criminal, there isn't the balance to spot issues and to try and restore the balance. Would it have stopped this particular crime? Who knows, would funds in youth service have stopped crime..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant It's not "spent on other" it's money that would go into other services that could potentially identify potential future issues. What was a 13 year old doing hanging out with 30 year old - let alone robbing peoples houses<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DVATW No, it's asking MP's and the like to choose their words properly, as words carry weight and can influence people into making actions.

<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant @snb19692 My opinion of anyone who thinks that behaviour is acceptable needs to have a word with themselves. It's got nothing to do with leave and remain, it's about the behaviour. So there is an element of irony in your tweet. You can't tell me I'm wrong then presum the guy was provocked<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes #eggboy. Walking into a room with right-wing fascists armed only with an egg and taking out their leader<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant The protests being held at Parliament Square by people like @snb19692 are 100% peaceful and they have to face this day in day out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant I've never said he is breaking the law, I'm saying he is a cunt. However, this could be seen as a breach of peace. I'm not calling him a cunt because he voted out, I'm calling him a cunt for his behaviour, it just happens to be centred around Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant They're not backing remain at all. This is a long chess game by May to get her shitty deal through. She now hopes the ERG will back her deal, which is why they're voting again next week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant You are skirting the point now fish. You're condoning this behaviour of cunts. I haven't seen any news reports on the remain camp breaking the law.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant  https://t.co/dJpvD54wG7 Vote leave broke the law, but people didn't react like that. These people aren't angry, they're thugs who believe it's ok to act like this and threaten people, as they idolise people like James Goddard, Yaxley-Lennon et al.<|endoftext|>

So it's nothing to do with being stronger outside the EU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rycochet @PeakyBlindas Thing is about apprenticeships is that it gives the company an option of paying less than minimum wage. The figure varies with age, for under 18s it's either just below or just over 4quid an hr I think. Some companies pay more than this, and I'm sure amazon will be one of them...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Lugey6 Because they hold a different view of things to you, you don't like it. If they were all chanting to leave with a no deal would you say the same thing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All these people losing their shit over the #ClimateStrike can't see past the fact that it's kids. The subject is hugely important, but of course "lefties" kids don't know what is important. But it's absolutely fine for grown men to wear yellow vests and yell in people's faces<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TechSolChris So protesting is OK for adults to do, but not kids? It's not like they're protesting something stupid like shorter school days. Climate change is a massive issue that a lot of people don't take seriously enough<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dandouglas @mrjamesob I think companies even talking about this is a step forward. It's only the last few years with my current company I've heard a company talk about it.

<|startoftext|>@Krislb3 @Cameronpayne01 @GGSEurope @piersmorgan Again, I stress I do not support Islamic terrorism, or any terrorism for that matter. But I'm guessing that's where we differ, as you hide behind 2A to do anything about what goes on in your country, by your own people on your own people. Or are they all Muslims as well?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Krislb3 @Cameronpayne01 @GGSEurope @piersmorgan Is judge a whole group by the actions of some. Hence why I don't judge all gun owners for the actions of mass shooters. Ya get me?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Krislb3 @Cameronpayne01 @GGSEurope @piersmorgan Jesus, triggered much. What you've done here is change the whole subject to suit your agenda. This originally started about acid attacks, and I've shown you that your point was moot. I have never defended terrorist acts, and I never will. But what I won't do....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cameronpayne01 @Krislb3 @GGSEurope @piersmorgan Are you a joke? Your last tweet literally just said that. I've proved you're wrong<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Krislb3 @Cameronpayne01 @GGSEurope @piersmorgan We're going round in circles aren't we. I'm not denying the fact Muslims have conducted acid attacks, but your statements are misguided to just blame Muslims in the UK when the facts say otherwise<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The tribute to Ray Wilkins on #FootballFocus was outstanding. Shows the kind of man he was<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Krislb3 @Cameronpayne01 @GGSEurope @piersmorgan So this example seems to be from America, at least its implying to be. So again, how does this equate to the UK?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BadAndy782 @NaughtyDerek @RealEricBarth @MichaelSkolnik @IngrahamAngle @davidhogg111 Surely to protect the responsible gun owners like yourself, there should be more checks. Like there is with driving, so irresponsible people don't ruin it for people like you. Which leaves you debating with people like me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BadAndy782 @NaughtyDerek @RealEricBarth @MichaelSkolnik @IngrahamAngle @davidhogg111 No, I said all gun owners are "responsible" until they shoot someone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BadAndy782 @NaughtyDerek @RealEricBarth @MichaelSkolnik @IngrahamAngle @davidhogg111 That's what they were classed as when they passed the checks to buy one..... You must agree that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NaughtyDerek @BadAndy782 @RealEricBarth @MichaelSkolnik @IngrahamAngle @davidhogg111 Do I need to answer that? That's exactly what I'm saying. If you are privileged to own a car you make a decision to get behind the wheel in a responsible way. If you own a gun, it's on you to use it appropriately<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BadAndy782 @RealEricBarth @MichaelSkolnik @IngrahamAngle @davidhogg111 Riddle me this, if you're such an expert. The UK and Australia had mass shootings and band guns. The UK have had 1 mass shooting since. Mental!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BadAndy782 @RealEricBarth @MichaelSkolnik @IngrahamAngle @davidhogg111 My argument makes perfect sense. Vegas and Florida, but owned guns legally, therefore responsible, right until they killed someone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BadAndy782 @RealEricBarth @MichaelSkolnik @IngrahamAngle @davidhogg111 Aren't most people who are involved in a mass shooting "responsible gun owners" right until they kill the first innocent person?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SimsPatriot @JimmyMartello @retireleo @VFL2013 My apologies, but you have to admit seeing someone tweet in caps is the first sign of anger issues.  P.S.

<|startoftext|>@SimsPatriot @JimmyMartello @retireleo @VFL2013 Wow, you're an angry man. So this kid doesn't deserve to speak his mind after some dude tried to kill him? Got a question for you, how many times do you chant "USA! USA!" a day?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimmyMartello @VFL2013 @retireleo I wasn't asking you to choose Jim, was just pointing out that I'm not use to school shootings, so I was asking if you could call him a survivor. Why is he attention seeking? Is it because he is protesting for tighter gun laws and you don't like it? #Parkland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimmyMartello @VFL2013 @retireleo He isn't a survivor? Was he not in a school that was shot up and left with his life? Sounds like a survivor to me, but then again we don't have shootings of your calibre in the UK.

<|startoftext|>@Tutankhamun1989 Their live reporting, as it is all very speculative and creates mini moral panics live on air. We all want news ASAP now days. But we....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tutankhamun1989 11686 people have been shot and killed in the USA so far this year. Anyone can find stats. Maybe the media have questions to answer for....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tutankhamun1989 Their rhetoric is one of division and hate. Katie Hopkins - horrid, Farage - horrid and failure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tutankhamun1989 We'll have to agree to disagree. If you 'pattern spot' to often you'll always live in fear. Look at the people you retweet....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tutankhamun1989 So I'm guessing if I look on your feed now it'll have retweets of how it's not terrorism? Just admit you love spreading fear and hate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nerdlessgamer @RogerTendwell @LockerRoom101 @CaptHat211 Threatened to feel you need guns to defend you. I walk around in the UK without a care in the world. If you were in vegans with a gun<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nerdlessgamer @RogerTendwell @LockerRoom101 @CaptHat211 No you don't get it do you? Don't hide behind the 'defense' argument. You just like the fact you can have guns. You must feel really 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InsomniacPsych0 @vickiebd @Thomas1774Paine @AP I love how due to me not jumping on your hate bandwagon I am propaganda. The problem is that we are arguing about religion....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InsomniacPsych0 @vickiebd @Thomas1774Paine @AP Come back when you're ready to talk about the death/rape/displacement caused by Christians<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InsomniacPsych0 @vickiebd @Thomas1774Paine @AP Nothing of the sort, but I don't condemn before getting facts. I also don't refuse to acknowledge that other faiths are just as bad<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@InsomniacPsych0 @vickiebd @Thomas1774Paine No deflection, I'm working off @AP with my info. It's not like America have no problems with "white guys" and mass shootings is it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InsomniacPsych0 @vickiebd @Thomas1774Paine I've seen the report, and the PA state they have 0% evidence on their claims. If I claimed I know Santa would you believe me?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaemonGraeyson @RRangel4JC @TheAliciaBlades Can you provide these stats please<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Is that the best you can do?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nerdlessgamer @RogerTendwell @LockerRoom101 @CaptHat211 But I'm not talking to someone from Venezuela am I? Don't hide behind your amendment. Just say "I like to have guns" and be done with it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InsomniacPsych0 @vickiebd @Thomas1774Paine Changed your tune a little. But you're still only putting people from 'groups' that don't fit your view point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nerdlessgamer @RogerTendwell @LockerRoom101 @CaptHat211 Shame a country where you can "bare arms" to protect yourself has more gun deaths and mass shootings than a country like the UK or Aus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RogerTendwell @nerdlessgamer @LockerRoom101 @CaptHat211 Get shot at a concert. To even try and use that as an argument is rediculous. Shows the kind of mindset you have<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RogerTendwell @nerdlessgamer @LockerRoom101 @CaptHat211 There is a difference there though isn't there. It is someone's choice to eat bad food, drink or smoke. It isn't someone's choice to 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RogerTendwell @nerdlessgamer @LockerRoom101 @CaptHat211 So how many people need to die in your eyes before guns should be banned?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InsomniacPsych0 @vickiebd @Thomas1774Paine Still want to make that bet?  https://t.co/kc9JXrt8lk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nerdlessgamer @LockerRoom101 @CaptHat211 Same news corp not mentioned terror once. You're right, I don't see why there should be divisions due to skin colour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nerdlessgamer @LockerRoom101 @CaptHat211 To prove my point 2 people were stabbed in Marseilles and it's been classed as terror due to the nationality, this has happened and 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nerdlessgamer @LockerRoom101 @CaptHat211 Which shapes people's rhetoric and views. Which has caused the increase in hate crime within the UK and around the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nerdlessgamer @LockerRoom101 @CaptHat211 I'm not America I'm English. You also couldn't be further from the truth, what I care about is how the media report events like this 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nerdlessgamer @LockerRoom101 @CaptHat211 Point proven read what the sheriff has said. Couldn't make it up. Local = Lone wolf. Non-white = terrorist  https://t.co/tP7xlXgU3v<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nerdlessgamer @LockerRoom101 @CaptHat211 No neither do I but you seem to state we have had a lot of terror attacks where in the USA it's always done by a 'lone wolf' if theyre white<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RogerTendwell @nerdlessgamer @LockerRoom101 @CaptHat211 What's your point? Laws have to be passed at some point. There will always be a 'pre' and 'post' of anything. #PutTheInternetDown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nerdlessgamer @LockerRoom101 @CaptHat211 Yeah, forgot it's only terror is they're not white.  https://t.co/RpAZ7VSzr7<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sendnukeslmao @DJCPI @nontolerantman Ha, I would love to hear their statements on this. You seem to speak for a lot of vets. If your grandad does believe that it is a true shame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sendnukeslmao @DJCPI @nontolerantman If you honestly think that, then it's a real shame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sendnukeslmao @DJCPI @nontolerantman My grandad was Polish, he was very proud of his country. Luckily he could tell me that himself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nontolerantman @sendnukeslmao @DJCPI I wouldn't be scared of the flag, the middle ages over weight militia would have done the trick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sendnukeslmao @DJCPI @nontolerantman What are you seeing in Europe Becky, maybe we can compare, seeing as im in the UK<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LeddiBaskers @TheStumann I think you read to much into the word 'forced'. Would you allow a child to chose how they found their nutrients from food?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DoddyTV @1rorycowan I forgot I tweeted it this morning until I saw all the notifications. I tweet when something enters my mind most of the time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoddyTV @1rorycowan Seriously Josh, it isn't. I get that a lot of people like the show, and some don't. But it wasn't the worst. I don't tweet for reaction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1rorycowan @DoddyTV I didn't particularly want you to see it. Hashtags are just how Twitter work. I'm sure my comment wasn't the most 'ignorant' one last night<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1rorycowan @DoddyTV It was 1 tweet. You didn't have to react to it, like you say, lot more things we should be reacting too. Could have ignored it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoddyTV @1rorycowan Since when does a differing of opinion equal troll? I've not been rude or abusive to anyone, unlike some people on this thread....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@stoner_turtle @1rorycowan You're probably right, but twitter still would have put it in the time line as it recognises non-hashtags as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stoner_turtle @1rorycowan I saw that on your profile. I like that mantra. And let's face it, a throwaway comment about a TV show has gone a bit ott<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1rorycowan @helgashakey If I'm going to be a pedant, I today I think I might, I'd actually need to apologise to 7 trees from my oxygen #KnowYourScience<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1rorycowan @stoner_turtle You honestly think that came from Google? It's called a thought my dear Roy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@helgashakey @1rorycowan Oh well, with that detailed tweet sharing his opinion, my narrative will totally change on this subject. #ISeeTheLight<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@decobanduk Please tell me you boys are playing @Y_Not_Festival this year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>78mph on a home made bike. Amazing. Driving is around a #WallOfDeath at that speed is quite mind blowing @guymartinracing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Give it the beans chief" #WallOfDeath<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seeing a guy ride a homemade bike is one thing. Seeing him ride one on a #WallOfDeath is out of this world! #GuyMartin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TechSolChris No I didn't. But seen the hovercraft one before. I watched the f1 one today that was on the other week. Which was ok.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TechSolChris Said with tongue firmly in cheek mate. Referring to the Watership Down issue yesterday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been looking forward to #GuysWallOfDeath all easter weekend. @guymartinracing amazes me everytime I see him on tv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't believe they've put #GuysWallOfDeath on easter weekend when Jesus was dead for a while. #ThinkOfTheChildren #ItsNotForEaster<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaddyLeigh1994 Easy, there's no need to swear. Lesson here is be careful what you tweet, as that message clearly looked like it was angry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaddyLeigh1994 Twitter riles me when I read comments from cretins like you. Yeah, your comment spills humour #FunnyNotFunny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Being outraged must have got in your way of being able to turn the TV off. #handpalm   https://t.co/tenH7xQnxZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaddyLeigh1994 Being outraged must have stopped you from turning off the TV. #getalife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't care what you say. The fire scene in #ToyStory3 is brutal. #Disney #Woody #BUZZ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Abbiebuckley We need to get you more tequila tough. At least you weren't as bad as that other girl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are 3 ways to do things: The right way The wrong way And the Max Power way #maxpower #Simpsons #homer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Abbiebuckley This is totally untrue! The only bad thing was that there was only 1<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Here comes the dark #ThisIsEngland90<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're not going to the American Adventure #ThisIsEngland90 How many people's heads has that just flown over?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think #Nffc played some real nice football in the 2nd half. #Mfc keeper kept them in it I think. Good game<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TechSolChris Ha, cheers for the kind words Pearson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@petervinemusic Tell me about it mate. I feel a little exposed at the min<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@petervinemusic  http://t.co/OYNQnkRyJd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@petervinemusic Oh and I shaved my beard off because of it. #GameChanger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@petervinemusic I was pretty good. But I just saw Harry Potter with a beard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Daniel Radcliffe with a beard has sent me over the edge. Just done something drastic. An actual #GameChanger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vicky_McClure @miraclesfilmuk Can not wait for this. To say the legend of Cloughie is still strong at #Nffc is an understatement<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today is definitely a melancholic day #TheSmiths #morrissey  http://t.co/sjQ6gEmkRf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel a stone lighter......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the fuck is #CoffeeWhip #ThisIsEngland90<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The La's to kick it all off. #ThisIsEngland90 is going to be banging #ShaneMeadows<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You ok hun? @David_Cameron In box me babe x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sunday = Bake day #sunday #baking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching Miliband always makes me think of Wallice from Wallice and Gromit fame #Labour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love that Corbyn rocks the no tie look. #relaxed #FrankieSaysRelax #labourleadership<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Corbyn hopefully an actual fucking change. Something different to make an actual opposition. This coming from a green voter #Labour #green<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>7 white guys sentenced to over 100 yrs between them for #paedophilia. No mention of race/religion/nationality. Funny that. #bbcnews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jonathan King arrested for child abuse claims #shock in other news, the world is still round and the sky is blue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamieblatant Agreed. Just don't see how they need to justify it. The question should be would they have threatened the UK? If yes, bomb em<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shouldn't the question be "were these people killed by a drone attack a threat to the UK?" Not should we justify killing Britons in Syria?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has @jamieoliver ever cooked anything that didn't include #OliveOil and #Lemon #JamiesSuperFood<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BrewCavern @libertines @Rock_City_Notts Massive surprise to me. Major mard for me today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Must have been living under a fucking rock to not know @libertines are playing @Rock_City_Notts tonight #fail #Libertines<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching @BBCNews makes me laugh how both guests and presenter have clear negative agenda on #corbyn Unbiased? I think not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolute crazy scenes at #trentbridge @StuartBroad8 ripping through the Aussies #TheAshes2015<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@icod does the deterrent now I think about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@icod treatment, or the chances of reoffending must be high. But to get away with a suspended just doesn't sit right with me. But neither...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@icod Talking to a prison officer I know putting paedophiles on a wing together isn't a good idea. And I agree there should be some sort 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@icod a guy round here was caught with a lot less and went away for it. So saying 45k isn't a lot is a cop out. 2/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@icod Where is the deterrent? I get that there are different levels of severity but 45k of pics and films? No, that's a light sentence 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funk buster has not brought the funk in any round. Don't forget your hat #GBBO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just waiting for the scotish bat to whip out a can of #IronBru and a bag of #Smack and plant it on her gateau #GBBO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funk buster is having a mare #GBBO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KellyKinetik God knows. There are people in #Hollyoaks who I've even seen before. She did give birth in a car though.... maybe dead?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amylegs90 I suppose it comes down to duty of care. Ensure that they're treated right when their life is crashing down around them. Hard tho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>. @SkyNewsBreak As long as Georgie and his banker mates are ok. Who cares about the taxpayer? #georgeosborne #typical<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#policecustody I am shocked that someone can have 45,000 sexual images of children and only get a 2yr suspended sentence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#policecustody is heavy shit tonight. How the officers deal with these type of people with so much respect baffles me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sleeping in my bed last night certainly beats sleeping in a Transit Van the night before. #Comfy #ynotfestival #YNOT2015<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LizSharlene Ha. Please. Who are you? You're a fan girl of a band who doesnt actually care about you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizSharlene Why would an ex pro footballer even care? You are spamming the Internet. #pointless #growup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizSharlene What amazing use of the English language. Why would people talking about football care about 1D'S new poor quality tune?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would rather cut off my own toes "@LizSharlene: @jimmybullard @TransferShare BUY 1D'S NEW SINGLE CALLED #DragMeDown ON ITUNES NOW"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The problem with treating Thursday night like a Friday night is that fact you have to face up to Friday at work. #TrueSay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cookerino @AdamRichman Plus the man has a beard that almost rivals mine. Must mean he is a dude. #BeardyFoodMan<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EONhelp Hi went 6p in debt on gas. Added money to the meter and now gas won't work. Any ideas?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had absolutely no gas in the #gym this morning. Earlier to bed and more food is I  order<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@avjestica @channelvalli Amazing how many people of different races/colour/religions fought under the British Army.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@avjestica @channelvalli It's nice that you use a Poppy as your profile pic. Mark only respect to everyone who's died in wars....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So sad to hear a body has been found in Mansfield. What a heart breaking situation for all who knew her. #rip #AmberPeat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@channelvalli And the Tories selling off the NHS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@channelvalli narrowminded life. It's a lot nicer to like people. Forget about the boarders and concentrate on the Tax avoiders.......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@channelvalli Zzzzzzz, I have to climb my lefty tree house and eat some chia seeds while singing camp fire songs. Good luck in your.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@channelvalli Typical bigoted response "Your view is different, so you're wrong" From reading your tweets you're a racist hiding behind ukip<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@channelvalli Ha, great answer. Whether I am left wing or not, does not change the fact it had stark resemblance to #UKIP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@channelvalli So why comment if you don't even know the content of the scene. Take your head out the sand and remove the rose tinted specs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With such a rank organisation such as #Fifa surely is 'the crook is dead, long live the crook' #blatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dont think I would move from #TheOtherStage @GlastoFest on Friday and Sunday. #GreatBands<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@channelvalli More similar than I am sure you would like to admit. Watch the scene then comment If you want I will record it and post to you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching the National Front scene in #ThisIsEngland resembles #UKIP election speeches this year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The way @ShadyMeadows goes from funny to heavy and serious in #ThisIsEngland is amazing. Brilliant film, brilliant acting. #92Popcorns<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ahhh #Monday. My favorite day of the week. I like it so much to celebrate I nearly had a party for 2 in my bath with a toaster #MondaysSuck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesNardi Heavy? That's an understatement! Such a rude tune. I listened to it 3 or 4 times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The @BBCSport picture quality of the #FACupFinal is shocking online. Nothing like the F1. #Disappointing #FACup #Grainy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesNardi Hi, What's the name of the remix of 'Going in for the Kill' that you play at the end of a ideal weekend mix on soundcloud?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #hometovote hashtag has restored my faith in humanity. I'm not Irish, but am amazed at their dedication #DoingTheRightThing #VoteYes<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wow, isn't @LouiseMensch a vile creature. Marriage made in heaven working for #TheSun<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The way people are talking about Steven Gerrard you would have thought he had died. But he has actually just had a lack luster career #LFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's #LFC result encapsulated Gerrards career. Gave a lot of promise, but died with a whimper. #SeeYa #StevieG #StevieMe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gerrards last match ends like his whole career. A whimper. Cant see him in the prem next season on loan. Not like Lampard. See ya #LFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> http://t.co/1uho1n3WYd Make sure Gerrard doesn't win this. Never been the best central mid in the prem #bbc #bbcsport #football #Premiership<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EONhelp deets to give you. I have the receipt from the shop and codes. Thats about it. 2/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EONhelp I have just moved into this house. I set up a new account for when it gets changed back to a credit account in may. So have no 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EONhelp That is a negative. I followed the instructions and it still said ¬£1.49 but ¬£0 on the card.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EONhelp Yeah. Just put some cash on it but meter says the card has ¬£0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EONhelp Just added money onto a card and it doesn't show on the meter. #HelpNeedMyDinner #FirstTimeCarder #LongTimeUser<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lilacsigan  http://t.co/GMb8HpbqV0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lilacsigan It seem you are confused. Israel is a country who depends on the U.S for hand outs #3BillionAYear<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lilacsigan You are using Wiki? I can edit Wiki to say i am KingKong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lilacsigan There is no point talking to you. You justify the deaths of children. Google 'range war'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lilacsigan So how could Britain (us) give Israel land? What right did we have?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lilacsigan I dont see any links that you are sending. What do I need to read?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lilacsigan Have heard of google right? Bbc Cnn New York Post All same the same So you are saying the West (Israel allie) media are lying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lilacsigan Funny that everything I look for says the same thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lilacsigan Israel was given land in 1947.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lilacsigan Plenty more where that came from. Although I dont think Israel needed any excuse  http://t.co/GDEEzBUWkw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lilacsigan @BenMittelman @Joey7Barton Please explain. Any answer?  http://t.co/9sKlCBRNFQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lilacsigan @BenMittelman @Joey7Barton This all started due to the 3 Israel students who were kidnapped and killed. Which Hamas didnt do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenMittelman @Joey7Barton @lilacsigan I see over 1000 people killed in 3 weeks. Because 3 teens were kidnapped. Now proven not by Hamas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lilacsigan @BenMittelman @Joey7Barton If Israel had not taken Palistian land this would never have happened. #TrueStory #StopKillingKids<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenMittelman @Joey7Barton @lilacsigan This is a range war. The death toll proves this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenMittelman @Joey7Barton @lilacsigan You said nothing like it. You justified the attack many times. No remorse and no argument #freegaza<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenMittelman @Joey7Barton @lilacsigan We covered this yesterday. Media is pro U.S. The U.S is pro Israel. So I doubt that very much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenMittelman @Joey7Barton @lilacsigan Lets say it was. What about the 9 dead children in the play ground through air strikes? #FreeGaza<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenMittelman @Joey7Barton @lilacsigan Attack on another hospital and a play ground. #StayClassyIsrael #FreeGaza<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@liamodowd @BenMittelman At least he thinks i am cool. Most sense he has spoken all day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenMittelman Better defence paid by who? Come on who paid for it? Oh yeah, America. Thats who. #scum<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>. @BenMittelman So a jew is using Germany in WW2 as a comparison to israel? Seen everything now. And reverted to swearing. #StillNoArgument<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenMittelman @JakePoole Israel started it by taking land that isnt yours<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenMittelman How many kids have been killed in Israel these last 2 wks? Stop justifying it. #NoArgument #FreeGaza<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenMittelman You dont really have any argument do you? #StopKillingChildrenInGaza #freegaza<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenMittelman Brainwashed? By whom? The media? Doubt it. How is the 3billion U.S $ Israel gets each year? #FreeGaza<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>. @BenMittelman @Joey7Barton Can you explain this? Or are your history lessons different to everyone elses #freegaza  http://t.co/UxB7UGKF0J<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenMittelman @Joey7Barton Are Israel not the ones who have taken the land of the Palistinians? Then murder them for good measure? #FreeGaza<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MunroStuie going to hit. Not excusing it, but after yrs of oppression its no wonder they went with violence. Either way, Africa wouldn't...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MunroStuie It was many yrs after joining the ANC. Sure the plans were not taken lightly. Pretty sure they were gov buildings they were...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MunroStuie question. What was the right way in Africa, seen as blacks couldn't vote and had no voice?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MunroStuie totally different. The group in power is in power because of a coup. But yes, we should. Not with military though. Answer my....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MunroStuie chose not to do anything and turn a blind eye<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MunroStuie I agreed he was nt a saint. His plan was to over throw a government which was racist and corrupt. While other countries.....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MunroStuie @VickstaNorts Jesus. Next you will be saying they deserved it in Tiananmen Square as well. The blacks in Africa were oppressed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MunroStuie @VickstaNorts The man united a country. Was nt a saint, but he got what needed to be done, done.<|endoftext|>
