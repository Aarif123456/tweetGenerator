<|startoftext|>To the Washington post.  Trump is his own worst enemy. He could have salvaged some self respect before leaving office. Instead he chooses to leave like a thug. This is how he will be remembered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To Trump.  You lost the election.  You did not win and you know you did not win. You’re keeping this scam going to serve your needs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does it bother him that Jill Biden uses Dr in front of her name. She earned the title.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bradheath These members should be thrown out of Congress because they are too dumb to serve. Dumb is dangerous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump should win an award for:  Top Liar.   Best Con Man. Worst President. And all the other crimes he has committed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>To Washington post. Trump is totally losing it. He’s unraveling. He can’t take losing. He should leave now so Biden can get things going. Trump is a huge man with a small brain. He needs to go   Now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@washingtonpost Trump and his allies are criminals trying to suppress the voice of the people. They are thugs who want to cause more chaos. The important issues are being ignored and they don’t care how many people die. Are there any honest republicans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Commish_Schmidt It’s a shame that there are so many naive people believing trumps lies and exaggerations. They cannot accept that trump lost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To Washington Post. Trump and his henchmen are truly disgusting individuals. They are trying to bully  the courts into overturning the vote.  They should be arrested for trying to overthrow the government. Why is this even a discussion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stop antisemitism.  Another disease in this country that needs to end. Jewish people have suffered enough. Hate has to stop. Jewish people have made many positive contributions to this country<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CNNPolitics The election was not stolen. Trump lost. Biden won legally.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Acosta I just watched this on cnn. So crazy. It’s hard to believe this is the president. He’s hanging on by a thread.  The Republican Party should end this ongoing tantrum<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>To the Washington post. Soon to be ex president trump is truly an awful ,horrible, ugly and dangerous human. He is trying to push through changes making it more difficult for President elect Biden to start his own policies. He can’t accept that he lost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To cnn. Why would we listen to anything trump and his henchmen instruct us on how to handle the virus. The only person to listen to is Dr. Fauci<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To Trump. You’re done Donny you and your party. Thank goodness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@washingtonpost It’s pretty easy to figure out a Biden voter. A person who wants the country to return to normalcy. We haven’t had that in the past four years. We’ve had craziness and no leadership. We are still in the midst of the pandemic and need a president with a plan to guide us through.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To David Axelrod.  Maybe the turkey can return the favor<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Scaramucci the republicans have created this monster and now he won’t leave. They gave trump too much power and kissed his butt. He took ownership of the party and molded it to what he wants from it. They gave him what he wanted. I hope this backfires on them<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Trump should crawl away like the snake he is. He probably will never accept the outcome of the election. There’s no point trying to convince him that he lost<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden has won 16 electoral votes in Georgia which means he is our new President<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump That would be a great idea, right in the middle of a pandemic, it’s just what we need. Then more people can get the virus. More people can die. What is the rally for.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@atrupar Giuliani sure sounds like a racist to me , spouting his crazy rhetoric.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KLoeffler To live the dream we need to rid the senate of trump supporters. Loeffler wants to live her own dream. What about out dreams. The republicans do not care about us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cnn.  Trump and Biden are total opposites. Biden is an honest, caring man of courage and values. Trump is a liar, cheat, uncaring  and dangerous to our country. It is time to move on. People are dying and all he does is lick his wounds.  #25thAmendmentNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To cnn.  That is great news. I live in the suberbs and voted for Biden. Lets get to work cleansing the White House of lies and corruption.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To cnn. Trump needs to be removed from the White House Now.  He is no longer  performing his duties. He is blinded by finding corruption  in the voting process. There isn’t any.  Remove him from office. Is this a democracy or a dictatorship. B<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To cnn.  Trump does not want the truth. If you see the truth he fires you. His presidency was based on lies and it just continues<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To cnn. How long do the American people have to tolerate trumps behavior. We voted him out. The government is letting him get away with crazy dangerous behavior. He should leave now. He is putting us at risk. What happened to “We the people “.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump must go<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To Jim Acosta.  I feel trump should be relieved of all his duties and should not be making any decisions for the country. The state of mind he is in is a danger to our country. He is not of sound mind. The government needs to do something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/2yZOvcy6gL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To cnn. Leave trump in his bunker to sulk. There should be no communication with him. Totally ignore him. Eventually he will leave.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>To cnn.  Trump is still licking his wounds.  He may need medication to help him deal with his feelings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To cnn. I think trump should be left alone to wallow in self pity. He gets too much press. He’s done<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To scaramucci. What is going in trump’s library. Maybe hitler’s book mein komph. Or his collection of comic books. This is a joke<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Team trump. trump is poor pathetic excuse for a president. This could end if the Republican Party took charge and made it happen. Why are they so scared if trump. What can he do to them. We would have more respect for the party if they join forces to get him out of office.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>To cnn. Trump is so busy fighting unproven voter fraud, he has given up his responsibilities as president. He remains president until mid January 2021. He still has work to do. In reality we do not have a president working for us. It’s all about him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Team trump. There is no voter suppression and there is no voter fraud. The problem is trump who has decided to become king. Democracy does not work like that.  It’s time for him to leave. The people have voted and you lost. Man up and move on<|endoftext|>
