<|startoftext|>@fatimixha Dude. I have been saying this for years to our Albanian people. Palestain supported Serbia during the Kosova war and we still scream 'free palestain' when they hate us, long live Israel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliAbunimah To all Albanians, this is how muslims view us Albanians and I have been saying this for many years and I'm glad this individual has posted this. Palestinians are as big of enemies to Albanians as Serbs. Long Live Israel and death to Palestine.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pokeefe1 @vikingcoysman Brozovic and perisic are average, skriniar is a very very good player though. Don't understand the move on tanguys part. Inter Milan are not a upgrade and Juventus will continuously win that league.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pokeefe1 @vikingcoysman Lol if we swap Ndombele for Brozovic we deserve to be relegated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arianiti1101 @lindi91152144 @WNixin @tatalovic_milan @dukagjinlipa @malagurski The contrary, if the US leaves the remaining Serbs in North Kosovo will probably run back home. Kosovo will remain untouched, Serbia will not risk stepping a foot inside Kosovo.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HB_HeadCoach Yep. My issue with Arsenal is where do you draw the line? They as a club both as a social media entity and player entity are always taking these low digs on a consistent basis. Its a bit boring now, especially because they're not doing much on the pitch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LargoJd What do you think will happen when the market opens tomorrow?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lilkikey @DUALIPA You do know that Kosovo is officially independent right? There are no amounts of comments and tweets that can change that, its 90% Albanian and no Serbian heritage is there. I hope your people die a slow death.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HB_HeadCoach Neither is Aubameyang to be fair<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jlewis2891 @Craig_Spur @HB_HeadCoach True, and a very young Saka who is a winger by trait, Guendozi playing holding DM is an accident waiting to happen too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HB_HeadCoach Sokratis and AMN in defence are susceptible to brainfarts every 5 minutes. Saka is young, that midfield wouldn't work at the top level and Rashica is not ready for the step-up just yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HB_HeadCoach @mediocentr0 That team is going straight to mid-table<|endoftext|>
