<|startoftext|>@BetteMidler Trash spewing trash. What an incredibly hateful and racist thing to say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElijahSchaffer @JoeBiden and #Democrat silence to this lawlessness and violence = complicity.   @JoeBiden and the #Liberals cannot and will not protect you. They won’t defend America, they won’t defend you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dbongino Yup! As a real estate broker in California, I can tell you that good, freedom-loving, honest people have been leaving California for some time, and the pace will only increase. I, too, will follow soon. #Trump2020 #LeaveCalifornia #hadenough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bennyjohnson @JeffFlake has been a clown for sometime. He’s not relevant. He left the party long ago. #movingon #Trump2020 #PatriotsUnited<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamVTV Sadly, I’m not surprised as a resident of this state. High taxes, criminals set free on the streets and our neighborhoods, never-ending lockdowns, over regulation, rolling blackouts, broken roads, homeless everywhere, dirty air, lack of water, etc. #LeaveCalifornia #Trump2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebradfordfile Exactly. We must. Keep. Hammering. This. Message. He has dementia. He is not there. #trump2020<|endoftext|>
