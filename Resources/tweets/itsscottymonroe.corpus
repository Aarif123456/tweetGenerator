<|startoftext|>I really think @theestallion dad may have had other kids but her mom only had one and was raised alone . If that’s the case she is the only child and probably don’t know this girl fr . Met her once after her parents passed and now feel she’s owed something move around fr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ain’t aint no telling what type of relationship they had . Could’ve been a sister she just met a few years ago and never was close .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whether that’s @theestallion sister or not we don’t know the fuckin story . Shit I got a little sister I havent seen since she was 2 now she’s 12 if I got rich I ain’t gone throw shit to her either I don’t know her . Stop these fake ass stories because we don’t know the truth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn this a real ass hard ass decision to make because me I would choose my lover because we can make another baby . It would break my heart to lose my child but I know another can be created . Buuuut what would my wife want me to do in reality is the biggest question ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People saying the 11s is trash but them gold and black 1s are ass idgaf 😂 them shits is like wtf<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ThePrettyHomie Go look up dimephrofet she’s on a joint live<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ll be 27 Sunday ☺️👑🎈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m a Sagittarius with a Pisces rising and I always get told they know I’m overly sensitive, 3 different people , a sweetheart but a great friend and it’s all facts . I cry at anything that’s sad or cute or sweet 🤷🏾‍♀️😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think everyone needs to be on this live because I know a few people who need to hear this frfr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This girl doing readings and said “most people see the red flags but won’t leave even though they know or have seen how they’ll be treated by that person” like she said “if you’re not fully healed stop getting involved with people because you’re passing on demons” 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lord knows I need it run 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m happy to know I’m not the only one that has those days that I just can’t get out the bed and I’m learning all these gimmicks don’t work . I’m learning I’m my biggest enemy and I need to see I need me and inner peace . This helps me smile even on the toughest days<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just got a card pulled for the day and it was TRIUMPHANT. When she read off the meaning and how it can relate to my life now and it hit hard and was so true and I definitely am walking in it . Gratitude is also what I’m glad I have because some don’t .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Regular Funyuns been nasty since I had a taste of the hot ones 3 years ago 🤷🏽‍♀️😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck no 😂 I ain’t fucked none of my friends and never fuckin will<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes my girl would be quick to tell me a mfcka got at her . Ain’t no secrets bihh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes I have 2017 😂🤦🏽‍♀️ . I got out a in and out relationship and told myself I wasn’t going back . During the time I truly wanted to commit to someone but my heart just wouldn’t allow it at all I was fucked up fr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only person that really checks on me is my gf and we live together other than that people don’t check on me fr unless it starts with that and ends with something they need<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can’t say people don’t really do shit for me unless I beg for it which I won’t fuckin ever do again . I think the only thing that came close was when my gf got me an edible arrangement and a big picture of me and her for my birthday ☺️💖<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Weirdest ? 😂 uuuum a lawn chair at a public pool 🤦🏽‍♀️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Beyoncé period !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes I used to cheat like crazy when I was 15 because I was young I didn’t care and them bitches was doing the same . First time I really cheated in something serious was because she wasn’t giving me no time or attention so I got it else where and I don’t regret it<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I don’t see how y’all be doing these situationships that constantly keep you wondering if y’all gone actually make it, constant arguing about the same shit just for it to change for a little then go right back . I couldn’t do the constant inconsistency just no ! Waste of time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mfckas can dislike Sagittarius but there will always be that one that they want in they life for sure and still is in their life . Then there’s the others that we Sagittarius cut tf off that wish we were in they life .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love that it’s Sagittarius season ☺️ all the mfckas who claim to dislike us show so much love during this time .

<|startoftext|>Y’all could prevent a whole lot of heartbreak by taking your time when dating. Stop feeling the need to rush into everything rushing is what causes things to end faster than expected . Get to know one another fr, learn them in every season before deciding to make things permanent<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I agree but at the same time you can post them and their face just don’t tag them . Unfortunately this is still keeping them a secret .

<|startoftext|>The fact they had to do that over a female is what’s sending me 😂😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Omfg she’s so cute 🥰 little moana<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For them to tell him to gtfo they face because that’s illegal . He’s dumb asf fr . Like if you win you’ll win don’t force that shit because you see it may not go in your favor<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I have second mind to quit my job and get unemployment for a few months until I find something better because it’s just a no for this call center shit now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which is why I always keep in the back of my head “this mfcka can switch up on me” . I’ve mastered the art of not being attached until I know it’s for sure and even then I’ll still protect myself .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Make sure you can deal with a person in every season . When they’re broke, rich, depressed , overly happy or even sick . Pay attention to how they act in every season and how they treat you during because that’s how you’ll be treated in a relationship .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you get into situationship after situationship constantly you haven’t stepped back to love yourself first or even gave yourself time to heal which is why it never works for you . God knows you aren’t ready just like you do but you continue to let all these energies in .  https://t.co/LaXP67k2vd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amen ! A few people need to hear this .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Y’all don’t know how good it feels to wake up in Las Vegas and it’s 60 degrees &amp; the sun ain’t shining at 102 degrees 😫<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right I don’t need the broke energy around me at all 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People have done fucked up things to people and still think nothing but good will come to them . No sweetie . Don’t forget the wrong you done or how you have hurt someone 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like I feel people try to use people and that ain’t cool at all . I don’t like being used so I’ll do it a few times after that you can’t come or I’m leaving you hanging period !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hell no . See it’s cool a few times and very few . I had a friend that never had money but always wanted to go out . One time bitch had $2 trying to get into a club so we left her ass outside . We grown and you did it too many times NOPE ! If you don’t got money stay in idc<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I thought a bitch fuckin with a broke nigga said sum<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just because you follow me on socials doesn’t mean we know each other or are friends fr . Just because you know someone I know and they spoke of me doesn’t mean we’re friends . Like y’all weird asf 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually correct that I have had someone lie about knowing me a few years ago when me and my ex was parting ways .

<|startoftext|>I’ll never be mad at who a mfcka vote for but all black people should definitely start the movement of not supporting these black rappers who endorse people against their own race . They got money trump has money that’s all it’s about they don’t gaf about none of us fr<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Some of y’all on here really are looking for love more than you want to heal and that will be y’all downfall . If you don’t allow yourself to heal from what broke you you’ll constantly be in and out of relationships because your trying to find that person in the next .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When couples start to exchange blood no matter in which way their relationship is much deeper than just being together they tryna connect frfr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Top of the morning whores<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>When y’all start talking to someone or start dating and get sexual are y’all asking if they’ve been tested or doing so before becoming active with them ? Please get tested regularly . There’s people walking around knowing they got something and will spread it and some don’t know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get tested regularly please . Negative baby 💯<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I have twice in my life and never again 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who ? 😂 the lord probably helped that happened . Nahh I did . I was sick of the bullshit and grown ass mfckas not knowing what they want don’t nobody got time for that shit . Could’ve left me tf alone .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Depends on who it is and how long they’ve known me . I’m Scotty Monroe to the world , Court to people who are close to me and some people just have their own nicknames for me 😌 oh yeah BunBun to some 🥰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck yeah and my kids will . I’m sick of parents being so lenient with their sons but strict with their daughters . Also kill the narrative of boys have it harder that’s an excuse to baby your sons to me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Honestly idk I just feel people try to dislike me for something I did in my darkest times . Other than that 🤷🏽‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes even if no apology is given because I need to be at peace fuck you .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man I ask this a lot . When people have responded I’ve been told I’m cute, my dimples, how blunt I am, how I’m a great listener, and the way I carry myself and don’t care 🤷🏽‍♀️😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I joined back in 2009 on my old page and I don’t know I was a teenager and Twitter was new<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t mistake my absence in your life  for shit else because it’s just what it is absence . I noticed you being okay without me in it and trust me I’m okay after an hour 😂🤷🏽‍♀️💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dirtydianafoxx Hell no she cussed me tf out 😂😂 I ain’t get no punani that day . You feminine chicks be crazy she whole thought I was fuckin off with a bitch when my ass was sitting at the dollar tree up the street 🤦🏽‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yasssss ! I know so many people who are doing this now . Like y’all loving the mfcka with every inch of you trying to see the best in them when they already showed you who they are and all you getting back is sex and half assed love . Smh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m guilty I’ve done it before 😂 . She was hot too . Never again tho because I got a mouth full when I returned home<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People will say “this sign manipulated me” like mfcka we grown ... you allowed a mfcka to say some shit and fuck yo head up ? I can’t relate .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At all 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No dead ass I learned that the hard way with my gf 😂 y’all be caring but have a great way of acting like don’t shit bother . It’s crazy because I’m a fire sign but baby that shit don’t work with Sagittarius ignore me you’ll never hear from me again especially if I tried<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If as a grown ass mfcka your response to lesbians having children is “how are you going to have kids?” I immediately think you are uneducated and ignorant . Like that shit will make me look at you like you need to try grade school over again . Like are you dumb ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The signs I feel I’m most compatible with ...  Cancer, Aries, Virgo, and Gemini   Honorable mention: Capricorn  This really depends on the type of Capricorn too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only signs I can truly be friends with long term are ...  Aries, Sagittarius, Gemini, Virgo, cancer and Aquarius .   Honorable mention: Libra depending on the characteristics of the Libra because they get replaced quickly in my life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂😂 that’s funny . Only one I can say I get along with and never have issues is Pisces and that’s as friends . Eventually Virgo irritates me and Gemini will use me for their own sexual entertainment and I’m not too fond of being used 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very well the one I get along with most is Aries and Sagittarius . Leo’s act way too shy around me I don’t know if it’s the Sagittarius energy but they really soft when it comes to me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kiss: Pisces  Marry: Cancer  Kill: Scorpio   Kiss Pisces because them bitches sex is wild asf , marry cancer because they understand sagg and I think would make a good emotional partner 😂 and kill Scorpio because I truly believe y’all ain’t shit so I’m good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My favorite celebrity who is my wife is a Virgo the queen herself @Beyonce and she loves Sagittarius baby 🤪 . My second is an Aquarius ms @theestallion 😫😫😫<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kiss: Gemini  Marry: Libra Kill: Aquarius   Kiss Gemini because they nasty asf (well some are) Aquarius almost got this one , marrying Libra they seem to know how to love right and Kill Aquarius just because there wasn’t another option 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moms a Virgo and Dads a Libra .   My mom is a true Virgo and everytime I meet one they act just like her just 🤮 . My dad was chill but very quiet when he was alive and I find libras to be chill but I notice being friends they can be fake sometimes that’s the only thing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kiss: Virgo  Marry: Capricorn  Kill: Taurus   Kiss Virgo because I can get them to open up LITERALLY 🤪😈😂, Marrying Capricorn because they goal and family oriented they really solid if you got a good one and kill Taurus because they trash sometimes too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pisces bro . I thought the cusp sagg I dated did but that Pisces got her beat fr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pisces, Taurus or Gemini<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kiss: Sagittarius  Marry: Aries  Kill: Leo   Kissing sagg because I don’t believe in dating my own sign but I’ll fuck my own sign, marrying Aries just because I think them bitches may be a good catch 😂 MAYBE , and killing a Leo because they just can be basura sometimes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ehhh Geminis are cool as friends and all SOMETIMES but dating I’ll pass with a big pass 2 go 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I prefer a Aries because they blunt like me . This bitches meaner then us Sagittarius but I fucks with them for it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trust me if it was some bomb ass sex they’ve talked to a few of they friends about it but if the chick crazy she keeps it herself until asked because she don’t want nobody to get her dick 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If shit is better next year me and babe definitely getting costumes that match and going to a Halloween party . Covid just fucked up all my plans this year 🙄 at least me and baby get to spend our 2nd Halloween together tho<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Your partners friends aren’t your friends but at the same time you should be willing to get to know them and create some what of a relationship . If they don’t want too then fuck it but try ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It took one to be like that and I will never ever again . You come how I come or don’t come at all 💯 that toxic shit drains you and makes you not want to deal with any other relationship after<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These dudes out here in Vegas with these challengers be doing dumb ass shit . Dude almost whole flipped his car trying to show off .<|endoftext|>

Everyone has the ability to get up &amp; leave especially in the talking stage . So cut your bullshit you must like it cause you ain’t bust a move yet  https://t.co/vxVUfxBxMD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which is why mfckas gone start saying “I ain’t heard from you in so long court” yeah there’s a reason I ain’t chasing you and you ain’t thought of hitting me up so fuck it<|endoftext|>

Mfckas will fight because someone said they fucked with they girl just to find out it was true and still stay with her 🤦🏽‍♀️😂<|endoftext|>

So we were watching movies all cuddled up and I joked with .@theestallion about leaving home with someone at the show . She ain’t take it ...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Relationships aren’t easy . You’ll have good days &amp; you’ll have very bad days but don’t let the bad days out weigh all the good ones . Nothing’s perfect but as long as you work at it daily your relationship will become stronger &amp; bad days will become less &amp; less likely to happen<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>People are dumb they’ll leak nudes and videos and talk shit about the person but yet you fucked them and was with them and fucked with them tough at some point so you exposing the both of you 🤷🏽‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t argue with naturally bothered people, ugly people , bald head hoes or mfckas who ain’t on my level . It’s pointless 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Swear I thought bruhh had it 😫<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I believe so which is why it’s not good to make music about certain things because that can be used against you in court . That’s how a lot of rappers get caught up . The fact police report stated they were friends but his music says dating it can turn into domestic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Y’all be on nuts about these new iPhones . They just know dropping the info about them today I got customers calling asking when we’ll have them 😒 like damn can Apple announce it first 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GQ_GiftedQueen @whoispookie_ See yeah this ain’t coming from just people not having the money this comes from those convos where you work with people and they either don’t pay you all your money , take they sweet time etc . When you’re running a business time waits for no one so you have to become strict<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One thing I can say about Aries that I fuckin dislike is they got too many fuckin rules when it comes to friends and relationships . They so worried about controlling the situation that they don’t even take time to enjoy it before they setting rules for the person 🤦🏽‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For 2021 don’t expect to see me and my girlfriend too much . We are grinding , losing weight and taking trips all 2021 . We are building our future for our kids and family .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man I’m going to discuss it with my girl today we do a lot of pricing together for our businesses . I do want to ask do you put that fee towards their order or no ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man like fr especially when you know you broke to begin with wasting my time fr 😂 . Yep it’s going to definitely be mando soon . People gone be mad but thank the broke mfckas that enter my inbox<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man I swear I need to do the same thing for my art . I’m sick of these conversations that end after being told the price when mfckas knew they was broke to begin with .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I don’t know if I should be pissed or just upset . I’m just in complete shock bro<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People who don’t know cars think it wasn’t luxurious . Trackhawks can get up to $350K lowest $100K that shit is literally a race car<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The days me and baby don’t go out in Vegas are the days hella celebrities are here 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Y’all be seeing nothing but red flags before dating someone . People will dead ass show y’all the real them and y’all dumb asses still fuck with them 🤦🏽‍♀️ . Stop crying after because most y’all see the bad shit so suck that shit up<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This convo me and Domo having is so real . It’s so sad how friends can envy you , how a friend can be a snake and want your woman on the low and how people can want your life or want to be you and get so close to you even tho they dislike you . Just crazy .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Idgaf this was the worst NBA Finals in history . All these teams suck ass . Sorry not sorry even if the Lakers win tonight there’s no excitement fr 🤷🏽‍♀️ it’s going to be like  https://t.co/O7FQQT8MIg<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Outta sight outta mind 😂💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I never worry about another soul tho because I know a mfcka can’t have what I have . You can think my girl attractive and some but I’m here to tell ya she ain’t leaving a real one 🤪😈☺️💙<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yung joc didn’t lie tho y’all potnas want exactly what you have . lil fizz for with April and Omarion was his homie and Moneybagg yo is with Ari and was once cool with G Herbo 🤦🏽‍♀️ . That’s why I don’t trust a soul with my woman idgaf !<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>One thing that annoys tf outta me is a person that loves to speak ill of someone and what they’ve done to you but yet they’ve done so much more to you then that person ever did . Like revert that energy onto yourself love 💯<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Okay I’m done ☺️ I hope y’all enjoy 💖 IG: iAmScottyMonroe  Tik Tok: iAmScottyMonroe   Share your opinion on these signs ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My opinion on Pisces :  From experience I’d keep them as a friend of fuck buddy . They are loving and can be great in relationships but most times they don’t know how too so it’s best to keep them as a friend . If you decide to become sexual with one you won’t be disappointed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pisces as lovers ❤️:  Pisces in love are at the core the most emotional of all the signs. Extremely intuitive and sensitive, they seek romantic love and need a soulmate more than most. A union with a Pisces automatically makes their partner feel special and cherished .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pisces as friends 👌🏾:  Pisces believe that honesty is one of the most vital ingredients of a good friendship, but they are also keen to avoid hurting anyone's feelings. Fortunately, they are blessed with the ability to deliver home truths in a kind, loving way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pisces sexual level 😻:  Is there really a level ? They are the most seductive of all the signs . You can meet certain Pisces and just the look they give you will have you ready to submit . They’re spontaneous and will things Anywhere sometimes with anyone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pros: They are someone you can confide in &amp; trust completely. They are very devoted &amp; they will never break your trust. They are tactful so they know when to be straightforward &amp; they know when to stay silent  Cons: They are perpetual dreamers. Everything is better in their head<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pisces ♓️  https://t.co/tTZzs8fDXq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My opinion on Aquarius :   They are the most blunt sign . Expect the truth with them and no sugar coating they may even hurt your feelings with what they say . They will drop a mfcka quick if their needs aren’t met . Overall great sign great friends<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aquarius as lovers ❤️:  Aquarians are very passionate lovers and likely to give all physically once they are sure of their feelings for you. Aquarius is likely to try to please you even if they know they will fail. It is really a case of 'it's the thought that counts'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aquarius as friends 👌🏾:  , Aquarians can draw out anyone, getting a new acquaintance to tell an Aquarian things they've barely told anyone else before. But there is another side: Aquarius can be very private, and people think they know an Aquarius much better than they do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aquarius sexual level 😻:  Aquarius are very active in their sexual life. full of energy and their partner will find them very confident . Sex with an Aquarius can never be boring or monotonous. They openly convey their needs to their partners while having sex<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pros:  They are one of the most accepting zodiac signs. They believe that people are beautiful in their uniqueness. They value intellect as well .   Cons:  They are guided more by their mind and less by their heart. sometimes it’s hard to understand where they are coming from.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aquarius ♒️  https://t.co/IwXz0h53b2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My opinion on Capricorn’s :  They are the controlling sign . Things have to go their way if not everyone’s wrong but them which can be a huge turn off . I love their ambition and how goal oriented they are . They love family and their loyalty is out this world .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Capricorn as lovers ❤️:   Capricorn's love is hard-won, not something he hands out like candy to Trick-or-Treaters. Not everyone gets that’s side . Once in a relationship they can be faithful and will do whatever to make their partner happy . Their love is unbeatable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Capricorn as friends 👌🏾:  there is no better friend to have than a Capricorn. They are intelligent, funny, and loyal. This zodiac sign doesn't have a large group of friends, so count yourself lucky if you manage to befriend yourself one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Capricorn’s sexual level 😻:  tend to let go in the bedroom and drop the cutthroat determination. And while earth signs might be considered the most boring signs of the zodiac, if you're lucky enough to have hot sex with a capricorn the pleasure is all yours only if they love you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pros:  Capricorn’s will be one of the realist in your life . They’re goal oriented and all about family . They don’t take no bullshit at all .   Cons:  they are a bit controlling. They like things to go their way and they think they always know best. Gotta point this out to them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Capricorn ♑️  https://t.co/PZPcC4FfMD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My opinion on Sagittarius:   Being that this is my sign we have good/bad about us . We are honest loving &amp; full of life . It’s hard not to love us &amp; we are very unforgettable . We are down for whatever &amp; we don’t let many things get us down . Cant go wrong having us in your life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sagittarius as lovers ❤️:  Sagg will give you that unforgettable love that love that you can’t find twice . Sagittarius lovers can be very intense and attentive, generously planning special things just to please their partner . Stay spontaneous because they get bored easily<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sagittarius as friends 👌🏾:  Friendly, fiery, and great fun to be around a sagg makes an awesome friend. Their zest for life and happy-go-lucky outlook will make you smile, even when life gets tough. They’re blunt so can’t be too sensitive they’ll never sugar coat to save feelings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sagittarius sexual level 😻:  Sagittarius can be self indulgent . Pleasing you pleases them at times but if you don’t please them they get bored and will find it elsewhere. Gotta be spontaneous and slutty when fuckin a sagg they love new things that bring excitement . KEEP UP !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pros:  They bring rays of sunshine and fun into your life. Their carefree nature and laid-back behavior send signals that there is no need to stress about things and that it’s better to enjoy life with them.  Cons:  The playful nature and fun behavior can come at a price .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sagittarius ♐️  https://t.co/1PTjHx2qD9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My opinion on Scorpio’s :  They cool as friends never steered wrong when being friends with one they’ll hold all your secrets and some . I’ve known them to be cheaters and liars even tho some signs don’t see it because of the passion they give they can be liars and cheaters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scorpios as lovers ❤️:  the most intense lovers in the zodiac; they want to know you deep down to your core, so get ready for a passionate wild ride. If you have a Scorpio partner, you've probably already witnessed their ability to love you deeply, both emotionally and physically<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scorpio as friends 👌🏾:  Scorpios are known to always have the backs of their friends and family. ... Whether you need a friend to rely on, someone to keep your secrets or someone to build you up when you're feeling down, Scorpios will always be there to tell you the truth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scorpio sexual level 😻:  Prone to excesses, Scorpios are more likely to be considered sex addicts than any other Sun Sign. Not only are Scorpios provocative, but they are also incredibly private. Your sexual secret is safe with a Scorpio, and rarely do they kiss and tell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pros:  There will never be a need to spice things up with Scorpio. They are the most passionate of the zodiac signs and chemistry is big with them   Cons:  Scorpios tend to be reserved and they have a hard time opening up. They also have poor communication skills<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scorpio ♏️  https://t.co/FfRo7kmYqA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My opinion on Libras :  I think Libras are somewhat great friends sometimes can be fake . Once in love Libras tend not to know how to act they’ll put their before anything which can push others off . They don’t advice well even if the person is right . In love they can be dumb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Libra as lovers ❤️:  Being with a Libra is like living in your own version of "The Notebook." As lovers, these people are the most romantic among any other sign. Libras have a fairy tale view of love and togetherness, and as such, they take love very seriously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Libras as friends 👌🏾:  Libra is a wonderful companion. When looking for a friend that will be true to the end and always be there for you, there is no need to look farther than a Libra<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Libras sexual level 😻:  Libra's interest in sex usually starts early. ... It's not necessarily the physical aspect of sex that appeals most to these people, though. As an Air sign, a strong mental connection and good communication is important<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pros:  Libras are charming. Their flirting skills are perfect and impeccable, they are super confident and sweet and they will do their best to impress.  Cons: Libras struggle with making decisions. They need a substantial amount of time to figure out what they really want .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Libra ♎️  https://t.co/S7H4zJ2f7n<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My opinion on Virgos :  I think Virgos are the prettiest of the signs . They are so sweet when they really care about you but know they don’t fuck with everyone . Want the real go to a Virgo they’ll never steer you wrong . They can be know it all’s which is so unattractive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Virgos as lovers ❤️:  Virgos make the best lovers because they really do care. It might not seem like it, since Virgos tend to portray themselves as cool and aloof in social situations, but Virgos are actually one of the most caring signs of the zodiac.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Virgos as friends 👌🏾:  They may drive you absolutely mad at the best of times, but being friends with a Virgo really is worth the pain. They're perfectionist and exacting to the point of madness, but they're also the most loyal friend you could imagine. They don’t like everyone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Virgos sexual level 😻:  Virgos are the virgin of the signs . They don’t give sex to just anyone which makes them so mysterious . They have a slutty side but only few will see that side and if you never do they aren’t comfortable with you . When comfortable they become porn stars<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pros: Virgos are down to earth , calm and insightful . They are the sweetest of the signs .  Cons:  Virgos are overly sensitive. They take everything too personally and they are easily offended and hurt, even if they do their best to conceal it. Very petty . Controlling .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Virgo ♍️  https://t.co/UJpDuNfyQ8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My opinions on Leo’s:  From experience Leo’s can be the biggest liars . When being friends they can be loyal and as lovers they gone ride for you for sure . When that sensitive side comes out it can overly extreme but for the most part they a cool sign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Leo’s as lovers ❤️:  they tend to be excellent lovers. ... They need to shine, even when giving, and that's good news for Leo's sex partners. The downside is that Leos can be incredibly possessive, jealous and insecure. They're not above lying to impress their mate 🤭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Leo’s as friends 👌🏾: Leo as a friend is making a lifelong bond that you'll both value for years to come. Leos are warm, energetic .  Leo’s love making friends and it’s very hard not to love them back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Leo sexual level 😻:  Leos are known for their love of the spotlight and have an exhibitionist streak when it comes to sex. They also don’t give that nasty side to everyone only their partners and when you get it better be ready for that lion to roar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pros: Leos inspire confidence. They will, without blinking, say that they are amazing &amp; attractive, leaving other people no choice but to agree.   Cons: Leos enjoy the spotlight and all the extra attention they get but what they are really unsure of is if they ever want to commit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Leo ♌️  https://t.co/9KDq7hPAGk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My opinion of Cancers : From experience I think they are the most affectionate sign there is . I never had to question if a cancer was being real with me because they were riders . They love you even if you’ve done them wrong . Their loyalty runs deep asf . Elite sign<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cancer as lovers ❤️: As the most sensitive sign they do everything with love . They will care for you in ways no one else can . They want to know you internally and seek to find a deeper meaning to you so they can love you to their best ability<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Cancer sexual level 😻:  They love shower sex, bathtub sex, and making out in a hot tub. If you really want to seduce a cancer, try romancing them under the full moon. They are very affectionate in the bedroom . Touching and feeling is their thing .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pros:  Cancers are real sweethearts. They empathize with people and guard their secrets. They give their best and they don’t hold back their emotions .  Cons: Cancers can be really clingy. Their sole focus is their partner, which is never good. Their want for love can be toxic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cancer ♋️  https://t.co/afqFFQlW3N<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My opinion on Geminis : They are a cool sign when they want to be but other times they can be 2 faced which is what makes it hard to stay cool with them . They be ready to cut off anyone behind their partner but hate being alone . Most of them fall too fast big turn off!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gemini as lovers ❤️: When dating geminis can get bored fairly quickly as they seek adventure and excitement . They will be into you so quickly down to do whatever to keep you happy . They can be in long term relationships but only if their partner can keep up if not they’re gone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gemini as friends 👌🏾: Geminis find it hard to trust people especially friends . They will give themselves unconditionally to their friends so if they feel they’ve been wronged they don’t hesitate to cut you off . They will end a friendship over something simple 👎🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gemini sexual level 😻: Their sex can be very spontaneous . Most Gemini’s are down to do different things to keep the spice in the bedroom . Some geminis are better during phone sex than in person 🤭 but others will fuck you in the car . Depends on the Gemini<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pros:  They’re super smart, great talkers and always put your needs and wants before their own as they want to see you happy .  Cons:  They are the 2 faced sign . One minute they can be so into you the next they aren’t . They can be real and fake depending on the moment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gemini ♊️  https://t.co/NqtnjboOL6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My opinion on Taurus:  From experience Taurus are good friends and all but I’ve seen some that are terrible . They lie and hurt the people around them but then I’ve met many who are the total opposite . Just depends on the Taurus you come across . Don’t let any of them fool you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Taurus as lovers ❤️: They’ll go the extra mile for the person they love . They want to see their partner happy at all times . Their love is never questionable when it comes to relationships .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Taurus ♉️  https://t.co/WVJKnIpvND<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My own opinion on Aries:  They can be great friends but can also switch up on them over another individual . The mood swings they have are the biggest turn off as most times no one has done anything to them . They can be so stand off-ish making others not want to be involved .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aries as lovers ❤️: They enter love with passion nothing less . They are direct with their love and will tend to do anything for the person they are with even if it means pushing others out . The confidence they have is what attracts most people to their love .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OneInAMillyon_ Definitely true but I’ve only experienced the dominance with Leo’s with a stud the fems just submit more than be dominant . Y’all got that tho because y’all can get nasty nasty but I like it’s mainly just with your partner it leaves suspense for the wondering minds  💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OneInAMillyon_ I do I’ve had my fair share of Leo’s 😂 I think I made slut sluts tho because Sagittarius we don’t care I’m gone make you submit to me 🤪💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s already hot asf in Vegas and whenever you cook in side it just heats the house up even more 🤦🏽‍♀️😂 my shawty making pancakes and shit and the house just got hot asf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OneInAMillyon_ Y’all bitches nasty too 😂 Well y’all nasty with y’all partner idk if Leo’s are overall sluts like be down for anything I just know how they are when heavily involved<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me behind shawty . I’m really her ridah !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sex with a Sagittarius , Scorpio &amp; Pisces is going to be nasty asf . We don’t see no limits and we are the sluts of the zodiacs 😈 . We down to do nasty , tie you up , submit to me , your my slut shit can never go wrong fuckin one of us 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mainly because it ain’t my business to tell . I let people move how they want and if they decide to tell that’s their decision I won’t make that decision for them 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And most times it’s their own kids<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If you don’t support me now you’re going to wish you did 😌🎨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stop idolizing relationships . You don’t know what they go through but want to be them so bad because a picture looked good 🤦🏽‍♀️ . Start wanting what you believe a relationship should be not what society shows because society will get you into the worst situations 💯<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I agree somewhat because yes you need to just enjoy the time with that person first but I will say I’m not dating to waste my time either especially at my age I’m dating so eventually in 5-7 years into the relationship I can propose .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_QueeeenB Tell it 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>When my straight friends be like “Damn bitch you fine I’m not gay but ...” 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you have so many talents or so many things you can do you always have a hustle no matter what happens . Just remember every hustle won’t turn to a million in a month . I started painting last year sold only 2 paintings last year this year I get a custom order every 2-3 weeks<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You ain’t really gang you an enemy bitch ! 🤪🤪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Friendly x City Girls  https://t.co/TAt5H166yV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now days people want relationships more than they want to fix their mental health &amp; more then they want to love they self<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Once you detach from certain shit it’s a great feeling because once before you probably didn’t know how too .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To the point you’ll have to watch my socials just to know I’m alive because you’ll never speak to me again 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People will lie to others stating they cut a mfcka off whole time that person really dropped they ass and they had no choice . So now they are selling a narrative that ain’t true 😂 Pathetic  https://t.co/aKdTkgMEjV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@avskrys And I hope they continue too . I know 2 books are supposed to be about how Tommy and ghost became them . It’s just like they showed us the end last<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tommy is about to have a whole season just for him y’all 😩😩 #PowerTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Y’all mad they used the same song . Did y’all forget it’s still the same shoe ghost is just dead now .  #PowerGhost<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it a stretch to say I think Tommy gone show up in this season after Tasha mentioning his name .  #PowerGhost<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m so happy they didn’t create a whole new story with power book 2 😩 kept the same song and all . This season about to be crazy . @maryjblige and her family full of hittas 😂  #PowerGhost<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh she tryna tell us something y’all #Pvalley . Are we gone dislike Mississippi more going into season 2 laaawwwwd say it ain’t so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m so happy hailey didn’t leave Mercedes that would’ve been fucked up . Instead ms poetic grew some mfckin balls . Cedes came to save you better not leave her hanging  #PValley<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m sad  #PValley is over ! We better get 10 episodes season 2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PValley definitely touches on so many realities that people ignore everyday . From Keyshawn to Lil murda and Uncle Clifford and evening cedes and her mom . A lot of reality being put out and makes the show 10Xs better  #PValley<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So here’s my season 2 prediction . keshawn gone keep getting her ass beat diamond ain’t gone fuck with her no more and her BD gone try to come after diamond . They may run into some issues now that autumn owns part of the club and cedes gone have to go back to stripping  #PValley<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And after realizing that I be like “Toodles you gotta go”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everytime .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now time for #PowerTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I knew hailey was going to do that shit . BITCH COME THRU FOR THE PANK  #PValley<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mississippi disappointed me bro why tf you pointing a gun at diamond ? 😒 #PValley<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought this was @Kandi at first . I was about to say ooooooh everybody just coming out huh ? 😂😂 but this is beautiful 🥰<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Have y’all discussed how y’all gone do it when the time comes ? Like IVF or having a sperm donor ? Girl I got mine locked a loaded 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I remember when everybody outside of California thought they knew how to yike looking dumb asf leave it to us in Cali<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somebody need to throw a house party and everybody gotta dress like the early 2000s and play all the bay slaps<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you don’t know this song i can’t truly believe you from the Bay Area or California alone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But by that time you don’t gaf anymore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best feeling ever 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Youuu should’ve never called me a fat ass kelly price 💀😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chasity funny asf   Her: “friend can you do me a painting for my birthday since I’m coming to Vegas ? You can just do it on paper”   Me :  https://t.co/5JD1RUoYjo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well duhh you a whole ass fiancé now but y’all time will come and that baby gone be so fuckin cute 😩😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stop saying you over something you’re not just to react in a negative way anytime you speak about it . Clearly you aren’t over it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>See nope ! Thank the lord I don’t have a penis people would be out here thinking I’m a hoe 🤦🏽‍♀️😂 would never get a girl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PERIOD !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No mfcka look I would’ve had em in the relationships I had that were longer than a year now I’ll be honest one would’ve been .... never mind we ain’t gone speak on it 😂 but not a hoe !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m not the type to apologize so if I apologize I mean it but don’t think I’m gone keep apologizing for the same shit 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hell no I’m glad i can’t get a girl prego 😂 . I would have at least 4 by now working on 5 🤦🏽‍♀️ nope I’ll pass 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My gf got me spooky time PJs and lights yesterday and I’m just so ready for Halloween 😩🎃👻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One thing none of my friends can say is that I changed because of a relationship . I’m still gone be me regardless no matter what .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some people fear being alone so when they find someone they love them so fast . Pay attention !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It either be the ones you don’t know or it be the ones you somewhat cool with and whole time they envied you or found a reason to dislike you 😂🤦🏽‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn we really do say hella a lot in California 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A bitch that will run to you about someone they claim to be hella cool with and say hella bad shit I promise to you they doing the same with you . Mfckas be thinking it’s tea whole time that person getting the tea on you too .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reasons when I was single I kept shit chill because I know bitches could wake up one day and not want this . Saves heartache and more . Y’all be putting all your eggs in one basket in 4 months time and then wanna be hurt Nooo ! Should’ve kept some of them eggs 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stop expecting a mfcka to be faithful in the talking stage . Talkin stage no matter how long is still space to decide if you want this . Stop thinkin ppl supposed to stay solid half the time they aren’t during that time but y’all be sprung over a mfcka that’s choosing in the dark<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Period !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I be knowing shit about mfckas I shouldn’t know because someone they “trust” came to me and told me 🤦🏽‍♀️ . Y’all be thinking y’all got solid people in your life whole time they snakes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The biggest flex a nigga can have is a woman no one else can touch 😌 a lot of mfckas cant say that about they woman because if opportunity presented itself they’d choose tf up and it be the ones thinking they bitch won’t 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Bro like idk if the west coast is just more advanced in technology and shit but everytime I speak to a customer in TX, GA, FL and NJ everybody act like they don’t understand technology at all and it’s sooooo frustrating<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dead ass be those studs who are insecure or can’t do it themselves . Most of these studs try to portray a straight relationship so much they forget they are women . Fuckin idiots fr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m still doing OT tomorrow 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m over this job and they bullshit I’m clocking tf out early AGAIN! It’d time to find a new job ASAP !<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Honestly in love a lot . I’m so big in making my partner happy sometimes I forget to put me first . I’m working on it tho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ll send a long text message but if I have to speak I’ll literally have to breathe a few times before I’m able to do so .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes I’ve cheated in my past . No I learned cheating gets you no where . Cheating for me means unhappiness and the need to be free I feel instead of cheating leave if you no longer want it . Most times people still want the person but instead of talking about needs they cheat 🤦🏽‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A lot of affection 🥰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If she doesn’t already know ... I’m big on love and affection if I don’t get it I get sad . I deal with depression it’s gotten better so if I need reassurance please give it . I have things I’m dealing with from my childhood but I promise to never punish you for it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Depends soul ties can also be friends not just lovers . I have one friend that for surely have soul ties with but lover I’ve only had one and it’s my current<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“Bitch never stoop that low behind someone that couldn’t love you right. You know your worth stop to bullshit”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I take the lead in certain situations but most of the time is 50/50<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Words of Affirmation and The touching one 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People fail to realize its not always about your sign being compatible it’s also about when you are with a sign that isn’t finding what your issues are together and working to fix them so they don’t ruin the relationship 💯. Once y’all do that you’re good nothing can ruin it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People said “Sagittarius and Capricorn’s don’t belong together it won’t work” 2 years later I’m still with mine 🤷🏽‍♀️😌 it gets bumpy because we are 2 strong minded people but we don’t allow anything to break us . If y’all want it y’all will work at anything y’all see needs fixing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trust me I’ve learned being attractive means nothing . Don’t fuck up your green grass thinking it’s greener on the other side just to find it’s really turf 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man when I come on here in the morning I be realizing I’m happy I don’t work night shift anymore . Twitter would be dry asf while i was just up at 3 am 😂🤦🏽‍♀️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I’m a Sagittarius with a Venus in Sagittarius  😌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes there was a birthday I felt like no one loved me , no one really wanted to do anything for me . From that moment birthdays became so big to me . Like no one should be hurt or sad on their special day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Swear fems just be wanting to be choked tf up .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BTW if y’all into lesbian web series watch Choiices , Between women , Studville tv and NY Girls (I believe) . Once y’all get past the acting in the pilots you’ll love the series<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is always a Courtney in lesbian series 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tyler had bree fucked up too . You introduced her to crack and all and left her hanging once she got addicted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m watching season 2 episode 9 of @Choiices_Series and bro savannah gf was insecure asf . She constantly told her slim was only a friend nothing more or less and she still wanted it to be more than that . I don’t blame savannah for leaving her .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This bitch got on these university gold 12s with a cheetah print romper 😒 some bitches just shouldn’t wear sneakers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>End of time 9 Angels x Elhae 🔥🔥🔥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I used to write a lot of lesbian scripts  for shows and stuff when I was in my early teens . I really want to just go get a laptop and write an official one . I have so many ideas and I think I want to start my own web series or something .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this Is why so many women have been in engagements for 20 years 🤦🏽‍♀️ if they don’t plan a wedding or nothing within 2-3 years of engagement you ain’t getting married and that’s facts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some of y’all mfckas mentally unstable and I don’t trust that shit at all 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Twitter be having me rollin 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Y’all can’t expect to have long lasting friendships and shit and whenever something goes wrong instead of talking about it y’all want to write off your friends and shit and just disown them . That shows immaturity and that you need to grow tf up or be alone forever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man same . I’m tryna get my shawty to dress up with me too 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m really a chill ass nigga which is why people stay cool with me . Kick it with me we vibin period . Never gone be a dull moment 🤷🏽‍♀️😌<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Don’t pre order 2K21 on y’all PS4 it’s pointless . Y’all can only get mamba edition if your wanting to play on PS5 when it drops but further more you gone pay $100 for the game to play just like 2K20 until PS5 drops so you spent $100 for nothing basically .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need to go to five below this weekend<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I swear everybody who I started on my team at work with in January literally has went to another team . Little does my sup know I’m switching teams too next month because I need to start later and I can’t wait I need a new team .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wtf that was literally a monster in the clouds . I’m praying for anyone who could be affected by these hurricanes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m sick of these “I ain’t got no friends” ass bitches especially you straight bitches . Half y’all mfckas put pussy/dick before y’all friends and then wonder why your friends distance themselves . Y’all be alone because of yourselves no one else<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t label me a stud, stem or none of that shit im a Lesbian who can dress masculine or feminine or how ever tf I feel like dressing . I don’t abide by no imaginary lesbian handbook . Females have loved me so much more for being this way 🤪🏳️‍🌈  https://t.co/ynrkMnV3Rp<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I’m mature enough but can’t say the same for other parties as people love to talk about the past and shit so I just rather not . Only time I can is when we never decided to talk or date it was just attraction and that’s all because we are just friends nothing more or less<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If someone ever wondered why they love me so much or why they can’t seem to shake me or even why you can’t seem to want to part ways view my chart 😌<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This bitch dumb asf “when cardi speaks me and my bitches are liberated” whole time cardi is married she ain’t fuckin and suckin randoms for a bag . Dumb bitch !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That shit is not liberating stop trying to make being a hoe a good thing . Swear this bitch remind me of the ugly bitches in the hood and it’s mad annoying . You had no choice but to yourself through shit because niggas would’ve 2 stepped right past you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Girl we just hate cats they fuckin creepy asf . Cat lovers are the ones who can’t handle rejection be PstPstPst’n tf outta cats 😂😂 .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How women act with men is mad annoying 🙄 . They seriously surrender to niggas like I couldn’t 😒 .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And don’t ignore that feeling . I have in the past and it’s what hurt me in the end .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Maaaan I’m telling y’all be careful the people y’all allow into your life . Pay attention to what they say all the time . Most people only want sex and they say that constantly people be blinded by how much they “” like them 🤦🏽‍♀️ temporary entertainment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At all ! Because doing what you feel will make another feel better or make them happy will be what damages you later .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My friend told me I could be a therapist because of things I say on Twitter . Very true buuuuuut shit just comes to my mind out of no where so I post it 🤷🏽‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Period !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stop dealing with people who want you one day then the next day they don’t even want to deal with you . Those are people who you’ll constantly need reassurance from &amp; never know if they truly want you and that’s not a healthy situation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or they try to hit on me 🤦🏽‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bitches tryna copy cardi b now talking about “I don’t cook or clean and still got a purse” whole time cardi got a house maid y’all nigga just cheating and got the next bitch cooking and cleaning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People so messy . Last nigh they asked .@theestallion was she still cool with nicki on live . If y’all haven’t noticed Megan is the type “If y’all have beef that has nothing to do with me that’s y’all beef”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stop second guessing your intuition . 9x outta 10 your correct . Where people fuck up is when they don’t listen to their intuition .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/TrOK8r2qZ9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Houston ate the Lakers tf up 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Started my elephant painting and it’s already turning out so beautiful 🥺👑  https://t.co/eo2CXASyX6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love that I wear grade school sizes can’t nobody wear my shit and I can get shoes at a later time if they didn’t sale out 🤪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They finally came #UniversityGold12s  https://t.co/PG3yplUsBY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s what I’m saying if y’all battling Unemployment come back to it . They asses clearly want to have to deal with this for the next month 🤦🏽‍♀️ . Like y’all could be campaigning but instead y’all arguing over helping the people fuckin crazy . Let’s be real they got the money<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s my thing they already agreed on the stimulus check and on food stamps being extended they just keep battling with this damn unemployment 🤦🏽‍♀️ . I feel there are factors to be able to push this out . If you getting unemployment the $600 no stimulus for you and that’s simple<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m calling off tomorrow idc .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When girls comment on any of my post on any social and be like “you should never be that fine” I be thinking “what should I be then?” 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My shoes are finally out for delivery 😩 Tayy told me they look so saucey in person 🤪 . I’m about to look good asf this weekend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My head is killing me right now 😩😩😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Back to Megan getting shot here’s what I think .. I think Tory Lanez did it because Megan seem too real of a bitch to let a nigga go to jail for something he didn’t do . Further more I believe if he didn’t she would’ve spoke on his behalf stating he didn’t not allow a false story<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t because i know I did damage 😂 . That’s gone be me asf tomorrow but look I save so I don’t have to look at my account 🤪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My shawty told me someone won’t practically $80 racks off hitting at the casino and the first thing they did was buy cars, clothes and pounds of weed . The nigga won not the gf so of course he did dumb shit with it . Like nigga you supposed to invest and buy a house 🤦🏽‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh I hate people that are like that . You done made the person you fuck with your life so much that you can’t do shit without them or you push your friends to the side . Not a good look because lovers can come and go friends are forever so keep choosing them you’ll be alone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And honestly it starts to become okay because I don’t want to speak to no one who genuinely doesn’t want to speak to me . Just make sure whoever is making you act that way is solid and will be around forever because i no longer will be 💯😌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PERIOD !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only if they one the same wave . My sign gets the good and bad and it just depends on what type of sagg you get . You can get a cheater or you can get one that’s faithful and is ready to fall in love there’s no in between a<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ion like that 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Always my biggest question and your mom being old ain’t got shit to do with it . She probably been fat all her life .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is a such thing when your nails are too much . Y’all be thinking it’s cute when really it’s like “bitch wtf were you thinking ?”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IMO there is a difference in being a Dyke and a stud . Let’s remember tho dyke was a term used for ALL LESBIANS even the feminine ones back in the day . Many find it disrespectful now and I agree but for years it has been used and now it’s heavily used to offend masc lesbians .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everybody be shocked that Georgia went back to school, have parties and clubs are back open there . #1 IMO GA nor FL really closed down and #2 I hate to say it but 70% of people got aids in GA they ain’t worried about corona 🤷🏽‍♀️ #sorrynotsorry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People who play the blame game on everybody else for everything that has happened to them in life are people I can’t trust . Some things may be others fault but not everything . Sometimes people don’t even realize what they did before to even cause what happened to themselves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The way he stepped back 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These signs will be like “I’ve grown and I’m over what has happened” just to bring up the issue anytime opportunity presents itself and have the nerve to be mad .  Virgo , Leo , and Libra<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When that direct deposit hit &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So innovative bro 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well there it is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not da bayang 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Off top !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>See I’m getting one sleeve and a half sleeve my half sleeve will be for my sign , namaste and stuff like that . I hope you get what you want<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And once I learned that and peeped I act accordingly period ! I treat people how they treat me . I may have slipped up and tried to force some shit but I learned<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man I’m trying my biggest struggle is painting humans so I may do a practice canvas for Nipsey or something<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you so much I told myself I’ll get meaningful tatts . What are you trying to get ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@unbelievablenae My next one will be for my dad I may go prayer hands for him . I’m trying to have a full sleeve by summer next year  https://t.co/0tsJttaI8W<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everybody sees my potential and I’m going to start challenging myself and putting myself out there more . Like my friend said “not everyone will support you until you become big but there’s people out there waiting to support you and give you your flowers now” 💯💯💯😌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need to stop doubting myself when it comes to my Art . One of my closest friends of like 10-15 years just told me her mom mentions me anytime anyone wants some art done . She even said “bro you have a high following just cross promote yourself” 😩😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My fuckin 12s will finally be here tomorrow 😩 I’m so happy because they coming before this weekend 🤪 so a bitch gone be cute asf . Hair cut and hair rebraided .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New tattoo me . My first is just now healing and I’m ready for the next one 😌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Period ! The only way I’m talkin shit is if you decided to run me through the dirt besides that I could care a less about ya 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When a loved one you have lost visits you in your dream I’ve always been told their spirit was in the room hovering over you .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Definitely feel this . Not in my feelings but I’m growing and past things/people aren’t a factor at all . Only thing I’m hurting from is the lost of my dad and sister still other than that any other pain I have healed from 😌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My wife is so fuckin gorgeous bruhh 😩😍🥺 My friends day I’m lucky and I am in so many levels . Her beauty is just a plus to everything else that comes with this woman 💙💍👑 #MyQueen #MyDooders #MyLover #HerBiggestFan #NextPlusSizeModel  https://t.co/LarjAcCX7B<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ever ! At the end of the day I’ll die alone so I’m always gone choose me first in any situation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I’m okay with that . I’ve already chosen who I’m taking with me 🤪💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Once I mastered detachment and truly not giving af things became easier . It started back in May 2020 and since then I’ve been dropping mfckas like flies . They show me how they are and I show them they could mean nothing tomorrow 🤷🏽‍♀️  https://t.co/Xv9cHYDpra<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Period ! I’ll treat you like you regular degular ! I’ve had friends tell em recently “I miss you we ain’t spoke in forever” there’s a reason ! I don’t kiss ass I replace you 🤷🏽‍♀️ .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well scratch ya ass and get glad because I ain’t sugar coating for no mfckin body 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you allow someone else to decide if you are cool with someone you can’t stand on your own 2 feet . Idc if it’s a best friend, long time friend or whatever make your own decisions in life . I’ve had friends try to stop me being cool with people I’m not a follower sorry !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wouldn’t say we’re loners we just have that instinct when it’s time to drop a mfcka because we internally feel shit . I know when people secretly thinking about me and all it’s kind of creepy .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>See the thing about me I’m gone let you know why I don’t fuck with you the same . At that point if I just stop speaking to you the same or anything just consider yourself an acquaintance . It won’t be no beef whenever we do speak it just will never be the same .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And that’s what many people need time to themselves a without the need to have someone . I seen so many people in the last 2 years date someone new back to back and then they wonder why they haven’t found the one . You ain’t even healed yet or really fell in love with you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No because if I’m having sex with you it’s what I wanted 😂 . I can tell when bitches just using me for shit and at that moment I’ll deny you so fuckin quick .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can tell when you’re truly over someone whether it be friend or past situation/lover you stop lurking , vibes be completely off and overall you just have detached . So if you’re currently dealing with this that’s how you’ll know you’ve moved forward completely 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope there’s not anyone out there telling people they helped me be better for the next . Fuckin with you before I actually date someone doesn’t mean you did . I’ve healed myself from any pain I encountered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“I hate Beyoncé” that should tell it all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you so much I really appreciate that 😌🤗<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Currently finishing this painting and starting on my elephant this week 😌  https://t.co/f9n7hqxzqu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wym ? Is it complicated ? Are you not able to understand them ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me every time I see pitbulls in public 😩 . I can’t help myself I love them so much . I plan to have 4 when we get this house<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact my girlfriends mom tells me to call her “mom” 😩 such a sigh of relief after dating people for so long that parents didn’t even like they were gay or it took them forever to accept it .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me and baby definitely going to Thailand to see the elephants and feed them . This is going to be amazing 🥺💙🐘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They need to give me a role in #PowerBook2 or next seasons to come .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Period and kill the “we don’t know his side of the story” narrative. There was only one gun found &amp; it was his &amp; even if he didn’t shoot her he allowed someone too without stopping it &amp; I’m sorry Megan would’ve stated he didn’t do shit she too real to just let people say whatever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I knew I had powers 🤪 . Man all I gotta do is remember the time  https://t.co/LgmQ00PvkH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man I feel this deeply man 🥺 #RIPSophia shit ain’t been the same since you left .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heal baby girl please so you can give someone the greatest version of you .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And that’s all it’ll be is a feeling because at the end of the day in 2-4 months you can’t even say you really know a person things could change right after . Trust me I was in that position after leaving someone I met someone I felt was amazing and different . Wasn’t the case<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The friends who will send someone to you before a bigger person hare elite &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I love when my friends hear someone needs a singer or a painting and they hmu first 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Period . We have to actually gaf to even react so you know when we don’t .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Period !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They are saying it was a fireworks warehouse that initially blew up and you can see sparks but I’m trying to see what the second impact cause was .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Between Madera - Modesto 😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Once a Sagittarius, Aquarius, Gemini and Aries detach themselves mentally the physical and emotional come right after . You don’t ever want any of these signs to detach themselves from you because there’s no turning back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why she look in pain bro ? Those ain’t moans she hurting 🤦🏽‍♀️ dumb ass studs bro 😂 .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shit I’m not the same person i was last week<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Silently ? Shit it don’t be silent and what I gotta say I’m gone say to her 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I remember I was wearing my fav Versace cologne at my best friends house and her brother literally knew the name just off the smell and I knew then he had good taste . My cologne I use literally have the ladies complimenting all the time🤪😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can tell if a man or even a stud has good taste when it comes to cologne depending on what they wear . I can’t give mine away but I will say if they wearing axe and shit still please run 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I’m going to do what my friend suggested . For all my future paintings I’ll set a base price if more than 3 people want it auction it off . Highest bidder gets it 💯 . She does it with her custom sneakers and she says it’s fun asf . She made $350 on one custom .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I knew people didn’t really gaf how you feel when I told someone how I felt towards how they were acting with me and all they did was try to turn it around on me and after stating they understood changed nothing if anything did it more .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Facts . That’s why i hate when people say “tell me” when they know something wrong because why ? What do I need to tell you for and all you gone do is either blantaly ignore what I feel or push it to the side like it means nothing ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I never had someone who cared so much about me or my health until I met my gf . Shorty supports everything I do, she tries to stop me from doing what she notices makes me fall back and she tries to keep me healthy . My shawty elite yo idgaf 💙<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you’re cute in the masculine lesbian community you have experienced being disliked by other masc lesbians just because of how you look, the attention you get and just being you . Envy comes in all forms . It’s sad because that shouldn’t make people dislike you but  https://t.co/PeI3mmQXlz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And some deserve the way they’ve been treated . People think they can do wrong to others but the moment it’s done to them everyone is so wrong . Can’t expect good when you start off wrong 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you can’t have money with a gf/bf and without one your the problem not them . I hate seeing those post .... “now that I’m single I’m only buying for me” okay do you want a cookie ? Sounds like you don’t know how to maintain having money even when dating someone 🤦🏽‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never expect sugar coated advice from me . I tell it like it is whether you’ll like it or not .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh it’s really up this weekend everybody about to be here this weekend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saweetie &amp; young ma<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know one thing this song with cardi b and Megan better be fire asf . They got vinyls and shit already ready for purchase<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lord summer walker liking my post again on Instagram 😩 I remember when she reposted me on her story my shit went tf up 😌💕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I be bored waiting for my baby to get out the shower 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My mom over here watching vampire diaries talking about “he gone suck her blood” 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If brandy isn’t one of your favorite singers and top 5 I’m convinced your music taste is trash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big ole freak x Megan thee stallion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not a stylist but I’ll push yo fuckin wig back 🤪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I ain’t had to get nobody hit but I could 💯😈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going to see if the drive in is open out here in Vegas this weekend . I miss being back home in Cali 😩 the San Jose drive in is a vibe bro !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cash shit x Megan thee stallion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m all about a bag right now anything else is for the birds 💰🔑<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am so grateful that god gave me a voice that can sing 😩😌 having this talent is unbeatable .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me &amp; an album I’ll never get tired of .@IAMSUMMERWALKER  https://t.co/g0t7A1pXPl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How do people just be okay with not working or being productive ? Like all you do all day is smoke, drink or sit on your ass ? I couldn’t ! Even if I am sitting on my ass I’m finding a way to make some money . Y’all built different !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pussy is not a gift and I’ll say it again PUSSY IS NOT A GIFT !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hell yeah. That was me a few times in the past . Definitely had the right person but wrong timing and that’s okay 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you pay attention to what they tell you  you’ll realize people are fake asf behind your back . They tell you one thing and act one way with you but with the other person it’s different . That’s why I always say don’t come telling me what someone else said what’d you say?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And that’s big FACTS !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I remember this girl I was hella cool with had a gf but me and her talked all the time we were that close so I guess one time her mom asked if her gf was me and was hella excited so the gf thought she was cheating 😂😂 no bitch people’s moms really just love my ass 🤷🏽‍♀️😌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And y’all be asking why I be hitting on people’s mamas and shit .... the mamas be finer than they daughters 😂 . The moms be loving me too 🤪😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yaaaasss 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 people think finding someone will fix all they’ve been through when internally if you haven’t fixed shit can’t no one else do that for you and eventually that is what will ruin y’all relationship . Your partner should ADD to your life not become your life 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Part of me wants to work today the other part says fuck it 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I dated a sagg that was a cusp Capricorn so it didn’t go too well plus she had MAJOR trauma It’s not my job to fix that so it failed .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChillOnKloud Basically 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Say that shit 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No I noticed it usually happens if you’re a consistent weed smoker . I was like that before I moved to Vegas . I was smoking all the time back home in California &amp; only ate once day now that I don’t smoke as much I eat more . So no you’re not dying 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I sent her to get her nails done while I ran around that whole day doing this and more and she fuckin loved it 😌 . I’m about to do the fool for our anniversary she’s well deserving<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was our first Valentine’s Day together this year in person after she moved in and I can’t wait until our 2 year anniversary 😩💙😍🤗  https://t.co/q29zYLUHwd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My sister in law just had her baby today and I’m so happy . I’m spoiling tf out that baby 😩 .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spooky season is arriving soon and I’m excited 🤗 . Me and babes first Halloween together and we may do a spooky night full of games, alcohol and more 👻🎃<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Check out Scotty Monroe's video! DONT MIND MY HAIR IT’LL BE CUT NEXT WEEK #TikTok  https://t.co/YUCOZvFuch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you stop fuckin with people they’ll find any reason to try to dislike you even though they really don’t have one they just want to make it seem like they don’t like you even though in all reality they wished you still gave them some conversation 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mother Nature is trying to kill me today 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s only right 😂😂 I’m gone have you drunk asf 😈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That even goes with starting a relationship or even situations up bad or doing bad things when starting them . You can’t expect greatness and it’s full of toxicity 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Praying for anyone who needs healing in this time even people I’m probably not cool with anymore . Know that troubles won’t last forever sometimes it’s the beginning of something great and unfortunately you have to go through the worst first . Keep ya head up and keep god close<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Make it one and bring that ass to Las Vegas too !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this is why I still can’t understand how money is put into hands of mfckas who do shit like this 😒 . So you’ll spend 15 bands on a grill but not $3000 just to get braces or something SERIOUSLY ?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like fall in love in love like I worship the ground you walk on ? I want to say like a year . I’m a Sagittarius so we gotta see if you solid and if you are it won’t take long after. We will “love you” but falling in love is another level 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CA or NV period !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never be an insecure bitch and try to throw shade at someone who looks 10X better than you please I beg of you . The most insecure bitches throw the most shade knowing they couldn’t fuck with the mfcka they talking about even on they worst day .  https://t.co/ijnD3IsyLw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man you couldn’t tell me that back in 2014 my dumb ass 🤦🏽‍♀️ I should’ve known but aye we all have to experience some lessons 🤷🏽‍♀️ . I’ve personally noticed even with others every time they find someone on Twitter it don’t last twitter ain’t it 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel like if this bitch calmed tf down and stop doing and saying crazy ass shit she would be likable .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this is a message for people dealing with someone who is constantly back and forth with how they feel about you .... STOP FUCKIN WITH THEM . It’s not hard to choose if you want someone fr . IMO if you know you not ready leave people tf alone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn @Raptors beat the @Lakers by 15 pts last night 🤭 . Maaaaan Toronto tryna get another ring fasho 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Off rip ! Y’all be arguing with mfckas you not even gone be speaking to next week 🤦🏽‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Personally I don’t do baecations til we actually in a relationship . Why take one with someone you just talking too and possibly find out you don’t want them fr ? Waste of money<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me asf next week 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I meeeean is it not okay ? 😂😂 shit the little nigga come out of me when I’m in guts 🤷🏽‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like andell said on moesha “Don’t lend what you can’t afford to lose” 💯 if you’re the type to expect your money back don’t lend sometimes the other person needs it way more than you remember that .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>HAPPY BIRTHDAY @OneInAMillyon_ 🎈🎁🎉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PERIOD 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s when you know you’ve grown and you can tell when someone hasn’t because they blame others for how they act they never look at themselves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This meeting has turned into an hour and everybody just talking about some real shit tho . They still not gone listen to us tho so I’m just over it 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If someone feels they don’t have to properly ask you to be their gf/bf or they ask you “so do I have to ask?” Please don’t get with them they don’t have proper etiquette at all and that’s disturbing asf 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saying Oooohhhhh when your over the conversation &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I haven’t straightened my hair since 2018 when I first seen my gf in person 😩 my hair is just growing even more . I may not straighten my hair again until I’m 30 so like 2023 . If I can last until then I will .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bro I’m trying to be @lizzo friend fuck the fame I feel she is really a real genuine loving person and I need that around me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In this meeting at work they are just talking about their personal life and I’m just like 🙄 we ain’t friends let’s get this meeting over with 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most people still aren’t comfortable in their skin and that’s okay but it’s not okay when you aren’t being truthful with the person you talking too because you can’t be mad when they dub ya ass 😂 maaaan I’m saying !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ehhh I almost agreed because their are certain factors where you can stop someone’s bag . I.E. hair vendors . You give your vendor to everyone who ask and say your someone who does hair now they won’t order hair through you they’ll do it themselves .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KydSplash Long story short i was talking to a girl FaceTime constantly all I saw was boobs and face every time all dolled up she came to see me finally and let’s just say she was shaped like dude off the minions and looked nothing like what she did on FaceTime fuckin scary !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you tell family, friend or lover how you feel about how they’re acting and their initial response is to find something you’ve done or overall after you tell them nothing changes or they just become distant they don’t care . I’ve learned that 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Facts ! But I’ll be the first to tell ya FaceTime don’t mean nothing . I was catfished even through FaceTime 😂🤦🏽‍♀️ yes it’s possible these bitches do it and do it well 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My wife so fly bruhh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me and my shawty anniversary about to be lit asf 😩😌💙<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SOB said “I can make a faithful bitch cheat off a whistle” well Scotty can make a faithful bitch cheat by just smiling and my mouth piece but that’s neither here nor there 🤪😂 #Facts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>See yeah you respected by letting it be known first I was fuckin with someone who would pop up just for the hell of it . I s wear one time the mfcka set down the street from my crib until I pulled up at home 🤦🏽‍♀️ crazy ass mfckas 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I’ve seen people hate on people on this app for getting new cars and homes yes I know it’s like okay “do you want a cookie for what your supposed to do?” But at the same time in the times we live in even before Covid it is an accomplishment to get your own place and car 💯💯💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is funny until they popping up at your shit without even hitting you up . Maybe it’s just me but I hate people just popping up at least you prewarned her but I had someone just popping up and it would piss me off fr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I couldn’t deal with someone that switched up how they feeling every fuckin day . One day you want me the next you want to be left alone and won’t talk about your issue . Nahh those type of people don’t know how to communicate properly and that can further ruin y’all relationship<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t ever ask me to stay the night at your crib if your house is dirty asf or hella cluttered . I don’t need rats or roaches crawling on me or in my shit while I sleep 😂 . Save yourself the embarrassment please<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s so weird watching the game right now . No crowd just the players 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This itching part of tattoos is fuckin annoying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trying to decide if I’ll watch the Clippers vs Lakers 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m getting off the internet at 9pm tonight because y’all will not ruin #BlackisKing for me . I’m not watching it until tomorrow .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No one talks about how much friendship break ups hurt . People ain’t ready for that convo .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I want to make my baby lunch today 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So everybody in Vegas be paying $70+ to get weed / carts man I stay running into mad discounts or playing the system . I never pay more than like $50 for anything I get . I’m paying California prices 🤪💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I Thought he was a wax figure for a min 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OH STFU NO ONE CARES 🙄😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn when I go through my memories on Facebook I’m reminded how much of a hoe I was when it came to bitches and I was mad fuckin ruthless during Q&amp;A 😂😂 . They would try to get at me 24/7 but my picky ass was so mean 🤦🏽‍♀️😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love when there’s a vale at work 😩 best shit ever !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m telling you it’s a great feeling . My girl is so comfortable and used to me but the spice , excitement and love is so strong and amazing 😩🥺💙<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man I love it 😂 let em think they know your life whole time you posting bullshit and no one knows anything 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let’s be real tho some mothers will have they own silent beef with your partner . Some mothers don’t want their kids dating and when they do they start to feel as if that person is taking their kid away 🙄🤦🏽‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s friend or lover 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IMO overthinking is based off fear . You already have in your head what you expect to happen further manifesting bad things . Intuition is what you feel and signs you are given . Even though you not thinking bad something keeps telling you this or that will happen .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My god son be asking my best friend to call me talking about “CoCo Eeee Ooo Coco Doo Doo” 😂😂 translation “Coco play The box and show me the shark on Animoji” 😂😂 my baby love Roddy rich and baby shark 😩🥺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mama killed him mama killed him killed TBone 😂😂😂😂 Netflix about to be lit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Y’all better help the bear<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Angel numbers are real pay attention to those triple digits you are seeing .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yo my girl made her spaghetti last night and shawty made some peach cobbler maaaaaan when I tell you I fell in love all over again 😩 . My girl always makes sure I’m fed and I appreciate it so much . She really is a whole wife for soooo many more reasons 😌💙<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bro @netflix actually fuckin listened 😩 I knew I kept Netflix for something COME THRU BABY !!!!!! don’t play us and only have one season of all of them !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I get told I tweet real shit all the time . One thing i can say whenever I went to my friends and gave them advice on any situations hip or relationship it always turns out I was right. I’m not trying to be a know it all but I pay attention to red flags that my friends may not💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t think I know everything about relationships I’ve just been in the worst ones and some partly good ones . I’ve learned many lessons throughout them so I can give some great advice when it comes to relationships .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trial and error is needed and at times you may keep going through it because god feels you haven’t learned your lesson . It could be you move too fast, you get involved too quickly or even you keep picking the same type of person and until you learn you’ll keep getting lessons<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People tell me different things . My hair, my dimples, my smile but most tell me its just me all around 😌 .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂😂 . Personally nahh but the best feeling is when you have wanted someone for so long or however long and you start to get to that point like yeah nahh I’m cool . The attraction fades and all .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best way to do it so you’re not hurt in the end . Worst thing to do is meet someone and try to make things a forever thing before it’s even official or even a for sure thing . Never put all your eggs into one basket until you know for sure what’s going on 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Debating if I should get my haircut Friday   Or let my Taper grow some more 🤔  I just don’t want my girl to redo my hair and my hair ain’t gone be cut .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes and no .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Change ya life x Haiti babii<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck allat do you see how stacked Megan is blood 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sliding down the pole x E-40<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Deebo x CB  https://t.co/6FiiU37MKL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can you blame x Kehlani<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People will say they cutting someone off whole time they’ve been cut off by that person they just want to make it seem as if they’re in control of the situation but they really aren’t 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m definitely going to have a full sleeve by summer of 2021 and be starting on my other arm 😌 . All my tattoos will have a meaning I promised myself I’d never EVER get no dumb ass tattoos when I start getting them .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My next tattoo will possibly be in October and I think I’m going to get prayers hands and my dads dates and then another in December for my birthday and that’s gone be for either my granny or my mom and auntie 🎀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the girl who did my Tatt was so fucking cool we stood outside after and had a convo . She’s much like me that fire sign baby so we talked about some real shit and I got to know her better she is real asf . She’s definitely doing all my tattoos 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ain’t no way in hell a bitch choose her ex gf over me and I go back to the bitch 😂 . Y’all built different now a days .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This bitch stay in Vegas running around and shit but I don’t ever see this bitch with her baby 🤦🏽‍♀️ . Unfit ass mothers I tell ya !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My auntie Lisa’s birthdays is today 😩 I miss her so much man . Haven’t seen her in over 6-7 years I definitely need to go see her . Just hearing her voice today was everything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you ever switch up on me for any reason or stop speaking to me behind someone you better HOPE they stay around forever because you can’t come back here crying 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You see how thirsty fast food businesses are for money ? Whole hurricane and you got people working are you fuckin serious @Whataburger TRASH !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mad as hell that my shoes won’t be here until like next Tuesday 🙄 I needed them for this weekend bro<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes but we all have our days we don’t feel the best crazy part those be the days people think I’m the cutest 🤦🏽‍♀️ .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Main reasons why I’d rather have the money not the fame . Industry is a big ass high school full of messy ass old mfckas 🤦🏽‍♀️ . That shit is crazy asf .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel Megan tried to surround herself with people after her moms passing to keep from being sad which is normal but the fakes started to come around too much but now she sees not everyone was really for her just around because she is popping . I’d start cutting people off PERIOD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel like this was really hard for her . I watched all the videos people captured and bro my heart just sunk . Just know y’all really fucked over a good person but .@theestallion you see now the fakes you had around you baby and that’s what god wanted you to see 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Honestly all I want is peace and positivity around me . That’s all I crave when surrounding myself with people or even speaking to people . If I feel I’m more angry around you or speaking with you I rather not involve myself with you 💯😌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everybody thought my first tattoo was gone make me cry but y’all gotta understand I’m the type to mess with my boo boos when I’m hurt and I even will have my gf stick a needle in my skin 😂😂🤦🏽‍♀️ I know stupid but i set through my tattoo with ease I even wanted to sleep through it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man I’m saying 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am him asf 😂😂  https://t.co/TegZ2s1qEd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Niesha when tf you get hella ass bitch ? 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My gf she can’t go no where without me and I looooooove it . She says she just likes to have my presence there 🥺😌 . I’m lowkey the same 🤭😌🤪<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I may call in tomorrow . I’m thinking idk 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who else has the ability to ignore people sitting right in front of you ? 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And let me tell you the same people you be thinking would have your back when your not around be the same ones telling people your business or acting like they don’t fuck with you to certain people then come back to you acting like those people don’t mean that much 🤦🏽‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I get in this studio I’m going to give people another reason to love me . I’m pouring my soul out 😌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaliEdiblezPlug I’m currently working on some but this is what i have available plus 2 more 🥺😌🎨  https://t.co/HET4KQWCXF<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yeah and I feel like all these shoe companies need to do what self owned shoe stores do on releases make you put in your drivers license or ID to get the shoe . All these bots can create emails 🤦🏽‍♀️ . I’m still on snipes and shoe palace trying if it fails I’m get something else<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fuckin bots man . All these people who got em about to resell at $350 like damn can the mfcka who actually want to wear them get a chance 🙄 . Shoe palace is my last piece of luck if I don’t get them there it’s either pay $254 for em or wait to see if they’ll get restocked<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man I had 4 sites ready and still sold out within a minute bro I’m HOT asf 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Bitches will save “receipts” of convos they had with people like it’ll make them look any better 🤦🏽‍♀️ y’all literally look like home wreckers and women who have no respect for themselves but go off 😂🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More fems be sounding mad dumb . Their expectations aren’t even expectations it’s just want they visually want to be seen with 🤦🏽‍♀️ that’s why they always end up with a fuck boy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bitches who try to damage your shit I can’t get with . I’m not that pressed over nobody to damage your car like that .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We need College drop out &amp; late registration @kanyewest back 😩🥺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You’re so welcome 😌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah idk I have all the sneaker apps I didn’t see raffles for them and if so they may already filled up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes I think your best chance is with Nike or champs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m hoping everybody takes they asses to Finish line, champs and footlocker for the 12s Friday . I’m using 2 other sneaker sites and I’m hoping nobody uses them . I’m gone be up at 6:30 for them shoes tho so idc 😂 already got my card and shipping address in there too 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only at finish line everywhere else is first come first serve<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My stomach on 10 right now 😩😩😩😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Advice for today :  It’s easy to FaceTime and call and create a bond over time but what matters is if the energy stays the same in person long term. That’s how you’ll then know the situation is legit . Things will feel mad natural not forced. Wait to make any permanent decisions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got a whole ass wife blood . If you not secure in your situation you need to be alone . I’m a female so I’m gone have feminine friends and if you the type can’t handle your girl having masculine friends you need to re-evaluate if she’s for you 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There have been too many incidents where studs think I want their bitch . LOOK PSA:  IF I WANTED YOUR BITCH SHE WOULDN’T BE YOURS !   And I’m just gone leave it at that y’all be worried about the wrong shit 🤦🏽‍♀️😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The lamest thing anyone tried to say about me was “How are you arguing with someone with lip rings?” Reason being bitch couldn’t find anything else negative to say because she knew she couldn’t fuck with me fr . Look In the mirror first before talking shit please sis 😂  https://t.co/DK3cvxxt0P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hair longer , I’m way happier than I was then and of course looking better everyday baby 😂🤪😚  https://t.co/NtVMTuuV3q<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Personally have had sex with 2 and the first was a dub she talked a good game but wasn’t about none of it and the second let’s just say she was comfortable with me so it went far . That’s the thing they don’t get comfortable with everyone so if they aren’t you getting average sex<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One thing I hate about corona sneaker releases are practically a race to win the shoe 😩🤦🏽‍♀️ like releases in store get a raffle ticket or just be the first in line period now it’s a literally race 🥺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just found out @nikestore doing only one shoe per person online so I’m online at 6:30 for them shoes because I’m sure a lot of people don’t know that yet because usually there’s no limit 😩 relief<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Most were just taught by their grandmothers or they were raised with a big family and was always the cook but cooking isn’t their passion .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Game night Friday 🎲♟🎳🎯 Good food 🌮🌯 and Great ass drinking game’s are under way 🤪 If you’ve never been to me and babes game nights you’re losing !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I’ve definitely grown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck that I miss 2010 . Take me all the way tf back so I can do something’s over then bring me back here !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reasons why I swear my girl should make one 😂 just make one to post the same make up videos and photos 🤪 . Y’all wouldn’t believe how many dudes will send her money just because she’s pretty now imagine a only fans 🤔😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had a weird dream about #TokyoVanity and my Lil sis . Let’s just say Tok was trying to jump my bones and my lil sis almost made me beat tf out my cousin and some random chick 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you never got a chance to follow my old twitter I feel sorry for you man 😩 memories and some on there yo .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reminds me of #TwitterAfterDark where you could type all your nasty thought and stories 😩 . Damn I miss the old days . I used to have twitter practically ready to fuck with my stories . FUN FACT: 90% of my stories were about me 🤭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trying to figure out what I want to get my girl for our anniversary . Her first gifts were make up and hair related and im sure she wouldn’t mind getting some again but I think I need to go for more keepsakes or cash tf out on mad shit  🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I mean fully get to know them 😩 I’m telling y’all I waited and got to know my gf fully and now I got a solid pure relationship . Don’t rush the getting to know each other stage because to find out shit you don’t like later will hurt far worst<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do people expect good things to happen to them even when they’ve treated others wrong ? Especially in relationships ? Y’all be really expecting your situation to turn out right but the way you got there was by doing someone wrong 🤦🏽‍♀️ expect what you give out !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can’t wait until our anniversary it’s about to be a MOVIE 🤪😌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A tweet 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 exact reason why I stopped fuckin some people . They thought it was payback nahh you looked like a whole hoe outchea 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heal before you date someone . A lot of y’all just jump person to person and think that because someone may come along and treat you right it’ll fix all your issues NO . All you’re going to do is end up pushing off everything you feel onto that person &amp; damage them HEAL FIRST !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They aren’t it’s just that people make poor choices when dating . They either move too fast, keep allowing someone to treat them wrong or they overall were never were ready for one from jump 🤷🏽‍♀️ that’s just facts !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Learn to stop giving information about everything to everybody . That mfcka that you thought you could trust because it seemed so right is gone be the same one running all your business to whoever when y’all fall out 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Period ! Y’all be having everybody and they mama meet your family be trusting mfckas you’ve only known 2-3 months all around your fam 🤦🏽‍♀️ . Only 3 girls in my time of dating have met my mom and only 2 have met the whole family only one really survived and my family adores her 💙👑<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I’m over it but sometimes getting it out is best just to fully release it all .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Period ! I peep everything and I promise the one thing you’ll regret is losing me in your life . Do that shit might as well consider yourself a stranger to me 💯  https://t.co/GrajYNdZol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With me there may be things I tripped about before but doesn’t take me long to get over it and once I’m over it my reaction is ITS WHATEVER ! Every time 🤷🏽‍♀️ .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>They about to charge $45 for a cut and $35 for a taper / line up 🤦🏽‍♀️😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s life . That’s why I stress to people take your time before you make permanent decisions . Learn that person , be around during their bitchiest times and make sure you can live with them long term . To me things only change when shit is rushed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂😂 it could be because her placements match with my compatibility 🤷🏽‍♀️ . I’ve learned caps don’t bullshit around but then again I got me a rare cap because she acts nothing like the ones I’ve met in the past<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love that people love me and my gf together but never think we’re perfect . We just handle our relationship differently . We appreciate the genuine love we get though and the constant want for us to make it 😌🥺💙<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When she calls me her wife &amp; when she tells people “I have a whole wife” 😩🥺💙 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it’s best to prepare yourself for the worst . I’ve saved myself from many things dealing with certain situations that way .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think #TheChi will be that show I’ll watch over and over again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If they pass the bill for another stimulus check I’m saving half and planning me and babes anniversary with the other half 😌😍💙<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Why do so many people think I have a whole sleeve of tattoos ? Like people literally be SHOCKED when I tell them I don’t have tattoos 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>9 months of talking and getting to know one another I had to make her mine this day 💙💍👑 #102118 met #011618  https://t.co/v5JfG7vWUU<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I usually change my after a year of having it sooooo May be time by the end of the year  and I’m literally only giving it to a few people .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do hope Toya boo ask her to be her gf today . They’ve been talking since March and it just seems like finally my freeeeen is  getting what she deserves in love 🥺😌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A ugly mfcka will date anyone because hey they can’t be too picky they ain’t too hot themselves 😂🤷🏽‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know my girls love runs deep for me because of how she loves me and treats me but ain’t nothing proving that more than when my shawty grabs my face and continuously kisses me and sometimes I’ll even catch her staring at me 😩 . I just know her love is pure and genuine 💍💙<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s not cocky because people know they can’t find no one else like me which is why they never want to part ways 🤷🏽‍♀️😌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My shawty getting PR from major hair companies which was definitely manifested she stayed talking about it . Nyx has asked to feature her photos as well .   So next her lash business will take off and more companies will want to do work 💯 manifesting it all she works so hard .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One thing i love about my girl and the fact she does hair and make up whenever we go out I get  a new look 🤪😍 and she be so fuckin bomb 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I remember when my shawty sent these pictures to me this same day last year after I left from seeing her 😩😍🥺💙 Idgaf ain’t nobody topping my woman she top tier PERIOD ! 💍👑  https://t.co/xZeyP7vrnI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I didn’t willingly experiment with this one I was in an abusive relationship where I was forced to take Ecstasy . Only thing I willingly have done is Weed 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nahh that’s that manipulation . I’d say don’t get involved with someone who says they love you month 1 they don’t even know you fr so it definitely comes from that attachment which is tied to fear so they throw I love you around 🤦🏽‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But once you have find that happiness within its okay for someone to add to your happiness ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s that fear of being alone and attachment . They don’t love you they just don’t love themselves enough .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And at that point you realize they weren’t and you kind of start to regret getting involved with them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just jammed out to bruhh whole page 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I take care of my woman by all means . A lot of y’all try to buy out your girls love I don’t do that shit . I ain’t ever had to spend a dime when I first started fuckin with her until I made her my gf and at that point it was genuine when I got her shit 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ll be damned if I go to a strip club and strippers legit have hairy pussies and shit . Like idk but to me strippers should make sure that mfcka is waxed and pretty . I’ll tell a bitch quick move tf out my face !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sit back and stop hitting up certain people first and watch how y’all will never speak again . #PayAttention<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me with bae 😂 but honestly your girl should be replying to that in that way not you .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Now y’all already know if Justin wustin was there none of that would’ve happened<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does this even matter when they are saving lives ? Fuckin sickening bro<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stop rushing into love just because you think if you make them wait a long time you won’t get the chance with them . Look here someone who really wants you will wait a year if needed to have a successful relationship with you . I don’t know who needs to hear this but here it is !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never rush the talking stage talk as long as possible trust me you’ll see you’ll learn more about one another and make sure that’s what you want . Too many people try to fall in love month 3-4 and get to month 3 of the relationship just for things to end suddenly .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And that’s a great thing to want . Some people expect that when y’all in the talking stage and need to stop expecting that . Y’all just talking it’s free game all over the board work up to that 💯 .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My friends be jealous of my friends 😂😂 . Swear most of em think I’m not supposed to have other friends outside of them . I love it tho because I see how much they love me and I love them too 😌❤️🥺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everybody still going to California and coming to Vegas and shit is closed and they be mad asf when they leave 😂😂 . It’s literally a pandemic and y’all expect shit to be open while cases are rising ? Stay y’all asses at home .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maaaaaaaaaan 😂 I would say I agree but I was probably on some hoe shit .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree because yes I’m your partner like you should come to me first buuuut friends are there for that as well . I just believe come talk to me first but I would never ask for you to not tell your friends because before me that’s who you told .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As my friends when I put that Love word in our friendship I’m always gone love you and nothing I mean NOTHING will ever change that . We can fall out and all but if I care about you I always will I’m loyal period !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That mfcka Eric is fuckin sick 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DRose you smoking dick if you say TMac dude couldn’t even get out 100% healthy AT ALL 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Signs that swear Sagittarius are the worst but can’t get enough of us ...  Virgo Leo Pisces  Cancer   They will say a whole bunch of shit about a sagittarius but will still want that sagg around, still want to fuck and still love tf outta us 🤷🏽‍♀️🤪<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I keep stressing this to people . Stop giving af let mfckas think whatever at the end of the day they ain’t paying ya bills .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you don’t FWM please don’t follow me on socials that shit is mad weird . Watch me like all the other weirdos from a distance don’t do that fake shit .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought I was the only one that knew these bitches work mad good during sex . Iykyk because hitting it from the back socks start slipping and shit 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or bothered leave me tf alone until I start talking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know you see how hard me and my S/O have been working and I hope you hear our prayers . Just hoping all that we are praying for and working hard towards comes to us in the next few months . We promise to not take anything for granted in Jesus name we pray AMEN !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lord as I come to you this morning I just want to say thank you for blessing my family throughout this pandemic . We haven’t struggled and it’s all by the grace of GOD . I pray anyone struggling is blessed extremely in the next few weeks ❤️😌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@devtheerotic @ItsMeMellyMel 🤓🥺🤦🏽‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s how it’s gone be . Do you don’t let her manipulate you or ever make you feel like you’re wrong . She about to feel how she made you feel that’s life 🤷🏽‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My god son asked to call me today . He calls me CoCo 😂 . My Baby like The Box x Roddy Rich and Baby shark so the first things he say to me “DooDoo.. EeeOoo” 😂🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did this bitch really say “Your at the point where you want to be with a black woman” 😒 wtf ? #GreenLeaf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She literally sang the song on that Lip sync show she didn’t gaf . Y’all try to find issue in everything but yet when she was alive I heard no fuss everybody was singing this shit . Y’all lame asf . RIP NAYA RIVERA ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ooouuu that Sagittarius hit home but then again she was a Sagittarius/Capricorn bitch was cray cray . I have met some that seem abusive tho and it’s sad because I could never think of abusing the one I love . Reasons I consider myself a different Sagittarius<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My thing is don’t blame us for you not getting it right then making us feel wrong for being over you . I’m not sitting around waiting for no one because if you want me you’ll do right by me it ain’t gone take me leaving you to do that PERIOD !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah I wouldn’t either . Like they say people want to get right for who they want too and to me it doesn’t take 6 years . See I dealt with someone for 3 years and she claimed she was gone do year 2 and still fucked up and when she finally got right I didn’t want it anymore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Real Hot Lesbian Shit @theestallion 🌈🤪😍 #TeamLesbian #TeamDimples #MegantheeStallion  https://t.co/o6xnigu0wX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Manifesting it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SHE CANT SING !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She didn’t she just killed somebody and some people don’t fuck with her the same but sis will never lose that beautiful voice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She didn’t sis has had hits but let’s be real she ain’t gone pop as much as her good sis Beyoncé and I think Kelly is okay with that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you see how creative she is ? She’s a Sagittarius sis gone do some crazy shit soon with her music and films . She’s always willing to do what others won’t 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I personally think her music became trash after a while . Jazze phizzle wasn’t making the best music after her second album 🤷🏽‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ahh hell nahh you got it the worst 🥺 I know they be trying some shit . Y’all plan to go separate ways or you tryna make it work ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeriouslyLanes You laughing but I’m dead ass . Those are the ones who wanna argue the most or have some time of secret beef with someone 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People thought it was a joke when I said we was gone be put on lock down before August or in August and look California and Florida already starting . Just because they said a few things was opening doesn’t mean Covid went away<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of those “I need advice” they start to tell you what’s up you give them advice and they basically say “nahh see I was going to do......” like so wtf you come ask me for them 😂🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nahh sis we got the plug . Barbers didn’t stop working . My barber was cutting hair from home but he only did certain people . I stayed fresh this whole COVID 🤪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very true ! I think people want it to be so bad because it’s hard to believe some people die so we as humans want to believe it was something else when in reality shit happens and it’s sad asf but that’s life .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gotta work on Saturday for sure for a good 7 hours to make up today 😩 oh well at least it’s considered OT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every time I wake up and get on twitter there’s somebody crying about how someone didn’t love them and now they can’t do the love thang . My biggest concern be Do you love yourself ? Like youre searching for love but have you learned to love you first ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will never argue with no bitch that’s still ugly when they get cute 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmm writing a book with all the crazy dreams I’ve had in it 🤔 an idea . -Scotty Monroe 07/14/20 8:25 am<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder if you can have dreams of things that aren’t necessarily going to happen in your life but may happen in someone else’s and it just so happens you had the dream with them in it 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I remember telling a old friend of mine about a dream I had about her and I told her like “I don’t even look at you in that manner so idk why I had that dream” bitch gone tell me “why wouldn’t you look at me like that?” 😒😒😒 I swear people be having hidden agendas WEIRDO .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s weird how most of my dreams be crazy asf and with people I would never do the crazy shit with 😂🤦🏽‍♀️ . My dreams be so vivid tho like it’s actually happening in real life . Y’all want a thread on this dream ? 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s just funny how every time I have a full week of weird dreams my nigga Christina always happens to pop up in one 😂 and the dream always some shit that we NEVER would let happen EVER !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The dreams I’ve been having the past few nights are crazy asf 😩<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Some things just don’t sit well with me man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That track hawk is fuckin fast asf . This bitch beating out any SRT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Y’all better stop hurting the people god sends to heal y’all asses . Y’all be hurting people who wanted nothing but to love you genuinely just to fuck with people who buy you out or just want sex from you 🤦🏽‍♀️ dumb asses 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not one of my exes in the past 7 years can say I ever did them wrong or wasn’t the best gf they ever had . People be scared of the love I give off so they start to fuck up or find any reason to ruin the situation . Reasons I’m happy I’m w/someone who isn’t afraid to receive love<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kayefentii Dead ass and they be crying like you did something wrong to them whole time they didn’t gaf about how you felt about anything and kept playing with your heart LIKE NO SIS FOH ... you just realize you had something good and fucked it up 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Manifest greatness, happiness and more and it will come to you . Speak great things into your life all that negativity will only bring about negativity baby 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you keep having back to back to back failed relationships start looking at yourself and what you add to the issues . Sometimes messing with a new person after next after the next you don’t give yourself time to breath and heal from anything and that’s most people’s issues<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes we’ve had some moments we aren’t perfect but I love that in my relationship we don’t let any bad times over power everything good we have . We’ll be mad then be happy because our love is more important than that one moment in the week 💯💙<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I remember people kept telling me before my girl moved in “omg are you ready for that?” “Oh girl that won’t go well” blah blah blah . Since the day my girl moved in I’ve been happier, learning more about her and more . . .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Went to my girls aunts house this past weekend and I got a bomb idea bro from her . Me and shawty when we move into this apartment we getting ring installed in the house, the front door, and the balcony . Try to come up in my shit gone catch a bullet in your chest<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And no matter what they gone deal with everything that comes with you and the love you feel from them will be so pure and genuine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stop saying you’re going to stop sending your S/O or girls in general long heartfelt text . Grow up and realize some people didn’t grow up expressing their feelings some people had to suppress their feelings and act hard . Be the one to teach them if your truly love them 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m not one of those lesbians that take nasty pics with my shawty then post them for the world to see . I know her body is mine I’m not worried about anyone else buuuuut your girls naked body should be left a mystery because they’re people who want to know for the wrong reasons<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ain’t that how it always is ? Or even if not that long they just want to all of a sudden “Do right by you” when you over them and the situation and now you the bad guy 😂😂 . Mfckas will try to manipulate tf outta you 🤦🏽‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pay attention to how they act in the talking stage . A person who switches up 24/7 or constantly on a emotional roller coaster that causes for them to not want to fuck with you the same sometimes ... RUN ! That’s my best advice because if not they gone make you get on that 🎢 too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My biggest fear 🥺 losing my partner man . My heart would be so shattered for so long .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If they claim to want to be with you but don’t want to take the initiative to meet the important people in your life (I.e. Parents) trust me they are not for you .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dude at the beginning in the white could’ve stopped it 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me and baby went to #ItsSugar today and got some exclusive gummies and shit 😌🤪<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I remember this bitch back in 2016 knew I liked her and she tried to play me by going on a date with someone else then tried to come fuck with me . So we went on a date and I didn’t fuckin pay she paid for her damn self 😂 . You ain’t my woman and you thought you could play me  https://t.co/zVtfW2yl7B<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No dead ass I feel her . Y’all be wanting people to spend $200 the first fuckin date and half the time that’s all y’all using people for is for a meal . Nahh I feel her . Niggas will do all this for a bitch because they try to buy bitches out !<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Famfirst__ I heard some people caught that shit when getting tested<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One thing I praise myself on is the fact I don’t need a crew to do anything . I stand alone . Yes I have friends but i can stand on my own 2 feet alone too many people need a crew to do hella shit !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“Get out my face fuck Donald trump”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the past 3 weekends yes and mostly Fremont street because at night there’s no clubs so people be on Fremont fuckin around . Some of the clubs have pools that are open but it’s by reservation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is sketchy and makes me feel so uneasy . Like she jumped in the water ? Wtf happened after bro 🥺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The strip is open fully just the clubs aren’t open yet . No curfew at all . If you cool with not going to a club then your good . Only thing i know is open is this hookah club<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can they be delivered to Nevada ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Google “your name + your favorite color + aesthetic” &amp; the first 4 (non-collage) pics make your aesthetic board.  https://t.co/BYA82IRZ9d<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Catching up on season 4 of #GreenLeaf and bro AJ ain’t give grace a chance at all 😩🥺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reasons I’m so happy I got away from my abuser and broke up with her as soon as possible . Years later when she tried to mess with me she almost wrecked while I was in the car and then she did get into an accident alone being drunk . Get away if you are in this situation !  https://t.co/6XbsYBpJuW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Women are dangerous . We control the world and hold so much power . Women are even more dangerous sexually . If a woman knows you frfr she knows exactly what to say, how to look and what to do to get you hot &amp; bothered  https://t.co/7Rw6suGWvR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And y’all still wonder why women love women 😌🥰 that shit intense asf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Motivation 😩❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brian off rip !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They always made tami seem bad 😂 she was just real asf I love her bro . That Shani was a shit starter (or however you spell her name)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What braided hairstyle should I have my shawty do tomorrow ? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂😂 I swear everybody was out in Vegas this past weekend . Since I moved here I’ve realized how many California mfckas come to Vegas 24/9 . I never came here that much being from Cali 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Set up my appt for Friday to get my haircut and I ain’t gone lie Brian already seem mad fuckin cool . His vibe gives me “I’m gone have you walking out of here looking good asf” 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn nigga 6 kids already and you like 20 ? Fuuuuuck ! Reasons I’m glad I’m a female because boy that would’ve been me mayne<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Same but I know I’m not ready for kids fr 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The day I ask for my woman hand in marriage her whole fam and mine will be there 🥰 . I haven’t decided who I’m going to tell first when I’m ready for that tho 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s so funny being a no label in the lesbian world because you see all the shit others don’t . I be knowing all the studs who claim they don’t like other studs . I’ve even had some studs talk shit about me dating all lesbians then years later they the same ones tryna holla at me  https://t.co/kQCn2OvsWG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I remember telling that bitch that day “don’t take me home and watch I have Alyssa come beat yo ass and I’ll take everything you got bitch” I was hot bro 😂 but so mfcka serious . She would’ve got her ass beat tf up and robbed fuckin around with me take me home bitch  !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn I really was in Dallas living with a psychopath 😂🤦🏽‍♀️ . That bitch knew not to try none of that crazy shit with me . The one day the bitch tried I had Alyssa ready to come to Dallas and whoop her ass she straightened up real quick 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Places I’ve lived: Fremont, CA East Palo Alto, CA Tracy, CA Stockton, CA Langston, OK Dallas, TX Las Vegas, NV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One thing I hate about the summer is the time change because I swear time moves mad fast in the summer and I feel like I truly get no sleep 😩 .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He went back home to see his kids 🙄😂 . Man see I thought he was gone fuck up my sisters head when she recently went to this dude but her shit was saucey so welll see shit it’s hair it’ll grow back . I’ve had a barber fuck me up before unfortunately<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fr fr 😂 trial bases see if he get it right . I’m so hurt my barber went on vacation 🤦🏽‍♀️ .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@exhaledbullshit See I said the same thing then I seen this . So I’m gone try him see if he hook my taper up 😂  https://t.co/Jn5dwfQ8LZ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Trying this barber this week 😩 I’m scared lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #SinNombre 😌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was the best video online bro 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The way my girl supports me with my art 😌💙 that’s some real love man fr .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fasho LMK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes clubs aren’t open yet but everything else is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How can people date another person who has no goals, dreams or ambition . Like dating someone who is content with life is a NO . Like you plan to smoke weed that’s it ? Where’s the productive side of you ? I mean real production not running errands .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someone probably needs to hear this :  Stop giving all your energy to dead situations and situations that aren’t bringing you happiness . If you find that situation hurts you, makes you sad or makes you anger stop giving it energy, wash your hands with it and Let go 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t trust shit in a bottle anymore unless I poured it or it’s still sealed . When i was 17 a bitch put ecstasy in my bottle and I didn’t know until I got home and she called me . I didn’t trip out but still like bro wtf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s okay to be in love . It’s not okay to fall in love and forget your friends . Some people forget that . They put everything into their relationship then when it ends expect all the people they stopped talking too to still be there 😒 no mfcka !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Period ! I learned this a while ago .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Since things are slowly opening me and baby can go on our date this weekend 🥰💙<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m going to start doing live art on Tik Tok 😌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Check out Scotty Monroe's video! #TikTok  https://t.co/PAP8mAZffv<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>“I’m gone pretend to beat yo ass but it’s gone be foreal” 😂😂   My best friend be going in on her son 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s a whole lot of ugly ass couples poppin out y’all should’ve stayed in 😂😂🤭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Y’all out here settling for people just to say you have someone ? 😂 I can’t with y’all bro . Like fr ? I can’t just be with just anybody bro . I have to be able to love you and your flaws, I have to physically want you, mentally accept you and emotionally be connected<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And being easily accessible does not only mean sex it also means jumping to fuck with anyone willing to talk to you 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We sit here for hours trying to figure it out 😂 . Food is really the worst<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chapstick is mando because I hate having dry lips . I lowkey judge people who don’t keep it then I look at they lips like  https://t.co/70VImGEOML<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How you skinny on the bottom and big on the top ? 😹 how that work ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Some mfckas gone hmu thinking shit sweet and they gone get hit with the “And who tf are you”  https://t.co/cpvp1A6MCP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/0EgFlwyJgo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If y’all know me y’all truly know my heart is Top tier and very genuine . The love I give is so fuckin pure . You will never have to question how I love<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PERIOD !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BIG FACTS ! Lowkey still be wishing they had access to me 😂😈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s how I come about me shawty with everything “We” because this a team thing 💯🥰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry I’m only expressing one time and if you show me no emotions or no change issaDub I’m not about to waste my time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone who gives themselves to someone the same way they gave themselves to you is bottom Tier human idgaf . Switch up that shit y’all love replaying the same relationships/friendships and situationships back to back . I don’t like to be reminded of anyone .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been there done that never again 😂 they so fuckin wishy washy they will want you for so long then out of no where find some reason not too then want you again . Even as friends it’s questionable because they can be fake asf but claim to be so real . Gemini is the bipolar sign<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No fr like “no bitch where’s your feelings” but you definitely know when the feeling ain’t mutual because their response ain’t gone have no type of anything it’s gone be so fuckin dry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ll hit em with the “same to you” so quick 😂😂 I don’t be caring .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most of the time they just 4ThePussy too . People just be wanting to fuck they don’t want nothing serious .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I appreciate that 🥰 we aren’t loved too much people just us the most but 🤷🏽‍♀️ I mean we’re lesbians 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes . I hate to label myself because I love women no matter their clothes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tap tap tap in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not a stud but I’m a masc and yes I love it .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“Twerk before I get mad” 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me with a few situations and I kept telling people once I was at this point ain’t no going back 🤷🏽‍♀️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>NF @exhaledbullshit fb ?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>A desperate mfcka or someone who has something to prove . I’m with you 100% on this 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Honestly they’re people who broke my heart in love but broke me completely ? No one could never as I find a way to love every time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very 😌🥰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All the time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m not even gone cap I love my woman pretty but truthfully I feel like to really be able to have sex with them you have to physically be attracted to them . Someone people will have sex with someone they’re not physically attracted too just to say they fucked them sadly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In a relationship<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scotty<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Man that just brought back so much it’s crazy she really did envy me for nothing . She thought because where I lived we was rich 😒 no bitch my parents just weren’t lazy and took us out EPA to live better which was what they were supposed to do . Sorry your mom felt different<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man I dated someone who secretly envied me . I didn’t realize until we broke up that every time she came to my house she talked mad shit saying I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth just because my mom sacrificed and hers was a drug addict who set around all day 🤷🏽‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg this used to be Alycia 🤦🏽‍♀️ she would be in the car with me and Tayy and take forever rolling<|endoftext|>

My Lover and Best friend 10/21/18 ♐️♑️💍 #TeamLesbian #LesbianCouples #California #LasVegas  https://t.co/PMCu6SlSwo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Never start your relationship with sex if you want it to last . I can say this is true asf I started 2 relationship with sex and let’s just say didn’t end well at all and the one time I take my time and wait for sex I find the LOML 🥰💙<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Y’all still be sending y’all money to these people saying they doing “Flips” . They whole ass be posting old ass screenshots they probably found on google and y’all fall for it every time 🤦🏽‍♀️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Okay and ? 😂  https://t.co/RHfreVj13g<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had to learn that shit myself a few years ago . Love isn’t supposed to hurt it’s supposed to be happy and genuine not toxic and full of confusion . Once I fully grasped that I will never NEVER in my life EVER deal with anyone who isn’t giving me the same love I give them !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You don’t ! People show you how they really feel about you and when they do that you get up and leave period . Love doesn’t hurt so if it is hurting you love yourself enough to leave the situation and find better . Trust me there’s better out there 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well sign me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m not the type of friend that you can come to wanting the same advice on the same thing hella times . Seriously I start to feel we’ve talked about it multiple times, I gave you advice you acted as if you received it well now you back with no resolution . Stop wasting my advice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2020 is really the worst year yet bro 🥺🤦🏽‍♀️💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All these deaths going into July bro 🥺💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep or they constantly think you’re being negative when truthfully you was just tryna help . They just take everything you say or do wrong . IMO it’s because of how they truly feel towards you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amen 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 I know somebody need to see this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That dumb bitch in the back would’ve got beat tf up bro . Like y’all really doing this shit ? I hate to smoke in front of kids I’ll dead ass be sober until they leave  https://t.co/W1xdUIu495<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Y’all must not believe in soul ties how y’all will give up the sex to anyone making y’all feel good at the moment . Make them wait because the person who waited will appreciate it more and then you’ll know they weren’t just in it for the sex 💯<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Stop dating these insecure ass studs . They won’t let y’all have friends, they think you fuckin everyone you cool with and slowly but surely they the only person you talk too because they so scared someone gone take you . find someone who’s more secure in y’all situation 💯<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I’m glad I never actually got into a relationship in 2017 man I was in the darkest most confused place I’ve ever been and I saved some people from getting the worst part of me little do they know . Even in my darkest time I knew it wasn’t right to get into something serious 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not a dumb ass excuse I understand this fully . Sometimes it is right people wrong time and if the person actually cares they will understand you weren’t in the right place and needed to fix you 💯 don’t ever force something because it’ll turn out bad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I could never take my girlfriend away from her family like that . Shit if relationship getting bad leave man cry for a few months but leave why take someone’s life ? That’s sickening and to joke about it too 🤬😤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s the Sagittarius in you angel . A weak mfcka took you out because you were you and they couldn’t handle it . Rest Up Baby girl 💕🥺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Speaking of this whole situation with the girl killing her gf . My friend Toya went through that in 2017 I believe . Ole girl came to live with her after dating for a few months and tried to run my nigga over with a car bro . Some people ain’t built for this love thang .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is how you’ll know a girl is with you for you and not your pockets . Act broke and see how she reacts . Tell her you can’t take her on a date but y’all can eat McDonald’s and see how she reacts . I need to know you riding for the long run and down when shit gets rough 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I’ll keep saying all day as lesbians let’s stop normalizing the “ill kill you” joke when fuckin with someone because people are really doing it . This girl didn’t deserve none of this no matter what was going on .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They’re saying this is the girl that got shot by her girlfriend 😣🥺 . A fellow Sagg gone for nothing bro . I can’t stress this enough DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS NOT COOL AND KILLING SOMEONE YOU CLAIM TO LOVE IS SICKENING !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomfordtitties Oh yeah hell nahh and you can tell when someone’s joking but even in the joking way it still can raise red flags because most of the time the person will say it more than once . Mostly females allow this behavior because they think crazy is cute until it really happens  https://t.co/wUlZMTYWVy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can’t ever say you know me off first hang out because I’m so fuckin shy around people I just met and I don’t talk much I sit back and observe . You can definitely tell by the end of the day if I fuck with you or not if I start talking way more and anxious to kick it again 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My co worker really must fuck with me the long way . She moving to GA with her cousin this week and the first thing she tell me “I’m coming back in a few months just to kick it with you”  ... just awwww I know people say they love kickin it with me but  https://t.co/ylEpwhxq6M<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What young ma said is really starting to come true “You the type to kill ya bitch if she try to leave and get booked for life” . Like she said some pussy dyke shit . YOU WEIRD ASS DYKES RATHER SEE A GIRL DEAD BECAUSE SHE DONT WANT YOU ANYMORE 🤦🏽‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m saying and now days it’s even more scarier because people actually doing what they claim to have “joked” about . There’s people who allow their partners to joke like that but don’t realize some people don’t be joking and your right it’s not romantic at all 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only people who can’t handle relationships do this shit 🤦🏽‍♀️ reasons I say all that joking “I’ll shoot a mfcka” is not cute nor funny . Y’all be thinking it’s cute when someone joke like that but this how you could really end up because they ain’t stable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never have never will . I’ve always slept with the door closed even from a youngin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ayyyyyye 🤪<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I used to say the same thing then I had my first 3 year relationship . Honestly it feels good asf being with the same person for so long . Getting to know someone new every 6-7 months is not hot at all 🚮<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gotta learn when to just not say nothing .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thuggs_passiion @_QueeeenB Oh well no we won’t be trying no high ass Whole Foods 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_QueeeenB Well when you eat healthier your not eating as much as usual . Smaller portions and better food options so your food isn’t going to go as fast . We shop at WinCo but we may try Whole Foods next month .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was always told that eating healthy is expensive but that shit was a bold face lie . Me and my girl been grocery shopping the last 5 months together spending almost $210 on fatty foods and when we go to purchase healthy food we spend $60 less . Like how sway ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s some insecure ass shit not only that .... she must not trust her gf to be faithful and that’s an issue in its own . You don’t trust your woman you need to find a new one 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shit my girl makes my plate wherever we go . I’d do the same for her as well but my girl never hesitates to make sure i got my plate first . Now when we have kids that’ll change because I want my kids fed before me 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The day I have a child with my wife bro y’all better watch out because I’m going 18 behind all of em<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@choycebrown So like it’s almost 2 years into this relationship and I just want to say I love you beyond words . I finally got the girl I’ve been searching for . You may get on my nerves sometimes but I wouldn’t have this any other way . I love you baby 💙💍<|endoftext|>

I ain’t paying more than $15-20 and that’s if you hella good my barber only charge $15 and does amazing work !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How long is your hair ? You can start a few ways but the most popular my clients come for is 2 strand twist &amp; the regular twist up . Depends on how you see fit in starting . I say 2 strand twist allow for your curl to stay at the end even when locs start budding<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you make a decision to do something and then get all proof that it was the best decision 💯😌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man I’m telling you .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Sagittarius are compatible with ... Leo, Capricorn, Aries, Virgo, cancer &amp; Gemini   Sagittarius have best friendships with... Libra, Aries, virgos, &amp; Gemini   Sagittarius are more toxic with... Pisces, virgo, Taurus &amp; Aquarius   In my opinion 💯🤷🏽‍♀️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>There’s too many people who are waaaay too content with life the way it is . Like they don’t try to do more to elevate themselves they’re too comfortable . I just pray those people find someone who can push them to elevate 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now that I’m older I think the biggest thing for me when dating is if I can live with you &amp; your ambition . If I can’t live with you issaWrap anyways &amp; I can’t date someone who is content with life as is I need someone who will follow their dreams which is why I’m with My WIFE 💙<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Take your time when dating get to know them as long as you can . People feel the need to hop in relationships and I really feel it’s just not wanting to be alone and having someone . I took 9 months to finally ask my gf to be my gf it’s been almost 2 years &amp; im still learning her<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I do customs and I have current art that I’m selling as well 😌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I swear this is my gf bro . She is so soft but she has a hard exterior and puts up a hardcore wall to protect her sensitivity . I get it but I’m breaking that wall down slowly daily<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Basically 🤷🏽‍♀️ I think the worst thing someone ever came to me to do while I was single and they was taken and unhappy was tried to use me to make their S/O mad asf . It worked but I had someone disliking me for nothing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is everyone becoming alcoholics during this COVID shit ? Or were some of y’all already alcoholics it just took being stuck in the house for you to put that out to the world ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes and I think dating a Sagittarius is awesome if they are the committing type and actually fuck with you like you fuck with them 💯 If they on some other shit like the one I dated hella years ago I’ll pass on those saggs but I’ll date one like myself 😌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I got told that I’m the only person with snake bites that actually looks good with them 😂 well thank you 😌 . I still think I should change my rings from the hoops to the regular straight ring 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Since Gemini season is here I just want to say I’m one out of many that doesn’t dislike y’all for something I never experienced . I like Gemini’s as friends but they have a fake side to them that I dislike heavily . Y’all can yet seriously 2 faced at times and that’s a ugly trait<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wooooow this is crazy asf . A cop hits me and I’m the blame ? FOH blood . I hope she fighting this case . He was going 94 mph off duty which I’m sure was waaaaay over the speed limit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She’s fine asf 😩😍! #TikTok  https://t.co/Q771hf5Eht<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn I graduated 8 years ago bro 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man that reminds me of Ms. Warmerdam and Mrs. Merin 🥺😢 they helped all of us get out of high school &amp; actually believed in us even when we was too stupid to believe in ourselves . I’ll never forget the love they gave us vs the old high school I attended that didn’t give 2 fucks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m not crying who crying 🥺 . You can tell his teachers and all cared about them and that’s real love man ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maaaaan and today I almost felt so comfortable saying “I’m thirty” 😂 shit I’m 26 about to be 27 this year and I’m already feeling the 30s hitting 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My thing is jobs show you daily who they really care about and it’s nothing but the customers soooooo since all you care about is them ... hire they asses I bet that’ll be your biggest regret because most customers treat workers like shit for no reason<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does this matter when he is dead bro ? I swear y’all will try to bring a black man down even when he’s deceased blood that shit is sickening . Wtf does a person killing someone have to do with what happened in that persons past ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now I see how my gf felt when I was working in the office before COVID happened 🥺 she went back to work today and I’m just lost 😂 like no fr I’m working too but I don’t know what to do 😩😩😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is this every black womans nightmare ? She got ass okay NEXT ? She a buttaface so I don’t see why any black woman would be pressed 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Advice to some studs : chill out G . You coming off too strong to that fem you like . You don’t have to be so fuckin aggressive you’re turning her off . Remember y’all just met and don’t know each other stop being extra asf and pushing shit on her she’ll push farther away 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like all you’re showing is you’re still hurt and letting that person know they still affect you in some way 🤦🏽‍♀️ let shit go fr !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate people who feed off of drama especially when it really has nothing to do with them 😒 . Worst type is the ones who have been hurt by someone and when they see that person has a little drama going on they are excited that it’s happening and won’t stop talking about it  https://t.co/a8PPx2WREz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder if moms who are selling their bodies for money or have suga daddies knows what it can do to their children . If your daughter learns what you do she may think it’s okay to do later and if your son knows he may think it’s okay to treat women that way 🤦🏽‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I miss my god son 😩💙  https://t.co/4AFBlJa96U<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now that I’m back on twitter I lowkey don’t even care to be on here 🤷🏽‍♀️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>My job got me fucked up but it’s all good bro I swear .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everybody so excited for Rona to go away but here’s one thing I don’t wanna see ... if you come to Las Vegas almost every month I DONT WANNA SEE YO ASS HERE when we open back up talking about “Time for vacation” LAS VEGAS IS NOT VACATION WHEN YOU COME HERE 24/9 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This reminds me of that post I’ve been seeing (“I don’t like seafood” baby just say you can’t afford it) 😒 . Like personally seafood is not my favorite I’ve had seafood boils and went to hot n juicy and shit . I love shrimp and shit but I couldn’t eat it 24/7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vegas weather is so fuckin bipolar 😒 . Today it’s like 70 degrees and for the next like 6 days then next week it’ll be 100 and up 😒 . Like bro choose if you wanna be hot or cold blood 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it’s fuckin weird and stalkerish when someone doesn’t like you but follows you and will even go as far as following your S/O 😒 so you actually like me then weird ass<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now here’s the other side of that ... if they still want you and you know they’ll jump at the chance of dating you again or whatever then yeah shouldn’t be following them period I agree with that whole heartedly 💯💯💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Y’all gotta grow tf up fr ! That shit shows insecurities . I don’t even think about the mfckas from way back nothing more than a friend shit half the time I forget I dated or talked to certain people  . If I didn’t date them in the last 5-7years don’t trip  https://t.co/66VBKQLsYr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh I hate when people say “he/she doesn’t need to follow anyone they dated” like wtf are we 5 years old ? Are we in high school ? There’s people I talked to but never dated and people I dated when I was a teenager that I follow on socials that don’t mean we want each other 🤦🏽‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People love to say they dislike Sagittarius but can’t get enough of the Sagittarius they come across 😂😂 Let’s be real tho it be that one Sagittarius that y’all will love forever the others are the ones y’all hate 😂😂🐸☕️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmmm don’t know frfr . I messed with 2 and only one I could tell be all about their partner and will love amazingly but the other showed me the hoe in virgos too and how they be lying 🤦🏽‍♀️😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Leo I messed with I could tell the love from Leo’s are amazing they are all about you buuuut Leo’s are liars soooo never will date one 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never actually got into a relationship with one but we talked and got to know one another and I can say they are mad affectionate and cry babies 😂 from how I see her with others I think cancers love is one you don’t wanna lose 🤷🏽‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m not sure they say sagg and Aries are compatible but I only ever become friends with them 🤷🏽‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wouldn’t really know both Aquarius I fucked with were cheaters and yeah just no<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think caps love is amazing when they show it . You gotta have a faithful cap tho because if they the cheating type you’ll hate your cap . They will help you succeed in areas you lack because they fear not being successful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you have a Gemini that is all about you the love is sensational . They don’t play about they partner tho . I think the only thing I don’t like they aren’t hella attached and I love for my woman to be attached . Gemini’s can change they mind quick ion like allat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From my personal experience I think their love is one you have to experience only if they are ready for it . If the Pisces is still dealing with their past you’ll never have them fully which means you’ll never get the love they can give . The Pisces are back and forth tho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Depends on the sagg you’re dating . If they aren’t the type to commit you’ll probably never get the full love we give off . If they are mature and ready for love it’ll feel like nothing you’ve ever felt before our love is different . Addicting in my opinion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look anyone buying a PS4 right now is wasting their money . Might as well wait for the 5 to release .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can’t wait until this weekend 😩  Getting my hair cut 💈  My braids looking good asf so gotta get my shape up to match 🤪<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I want to go to @Cheesecake and get some cheesecake 😩🥺❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People get upset when I don’t hype up the same stud, fem or dyke they hype 😂 Half the time when y’all hyping one it’s because they got dreads, long hair or just got hella clout for dumb reasons . Whole time they be ugly asf or just do dumb shit for attention 🤦🏽‍♀️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That coaching went smooth 😩 I was worried no cap 😂 but now I’m going to be extra fuckin careful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Keep this in mind y’all president says we don’t need anymore help ! Let that shit sink tf in ! The person y’all voted to care for America sent y’all one check to save face and says that’s all y’all need . Reasons I’m ecstatic I did no part in helping vote his ass in office<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m grateful I was able to keep my job during this time and was saving money before this shit happened but we all still need help period . Y’all dumb asses still gone vote for these fuck ass people in office who really dgaf about America they just want the “I’m president” title<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s crazy that people who are rich and having no financial issues or anything are deciding if we get money from them during a pandemic 😒 Like they decide whether millions of people could become homeless while they sit in their mansions with food, lights and water  https://t.co/T70krzxqy7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If they was smart they’d know that’s exactly what he wants . It’s a political mechanism . That’s why you play the system take that money and still don’t vote for his ass . People dumb because he the one saying we don’t need it fuckin idiots<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😌🥺❤️  https://t.co/h6bFZSGLbm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let’s hope this coaching ain’t nothing but going over saves and stuff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know this video was to be funny so this is not towards you ..... buuuut would this be considered toxic behavior in a relationship ? Like I feel we don’t talk about it enough and how it is toxic and lowkey a lack of trust in relationships<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hell yeah a few times 🤦🏽‍♀️ . Like bro no tf we didn’t or they lie and say we dated and shit like 😒 please stop the madness 😂 nothing worst than someone using you to make someone else mad fuckin pathetic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My job literally has us on a conference call with over 200 people 😒 like wtf . I got my phone on mute 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This FACTS . But you know what I can’t fuck with ya if you can’t defend me when I’m not around or if you are the one talking down on me to others when we not cool either 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m really not even trying to be mean to anyone today 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Y’all ever stepped away from someone whether it be a friend or family member and just observed without them knowing and you can just see the hoe in them due to how they get down ?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Nothing at all fems have made it an issue like studs aren’t supposed to want to look a certain way . It’s ignorance . I always ask what’s the difference if their hair was as long as mine? My shit look like a weave but there’s no issues when it’s natural but they can never explain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Insecure ass studs will try to keep you away from their significant other because they scared that she will like you better 🤦🏽‍♀️😂 You doing yo friends shady behind a bitch that you afraid will choose tf up so why tf won’t you leave her alone ?

<|startoftext|>I’m fuckin dead<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>On the rest x NBA YoungBoy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I think weed became less of a fun activity when everybody and they mama started doing the shit . When I started people had to sneak to do it still, sessions were so much more fun because of it too . Now you gotta worry about people who waste the weed during sessions !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The husband should help but why tf you didn’t put any of those 5 kids to work ? Chores don’t exist anymore ?<|endoftext|>

I get overtime some people may grow apart but people know when they don’t want someone anymore so it’s fucked up they’ll continue to stay then leave after so long<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>When you have sex with someone you’re sharing souls which is why being cautious of who you have sex with us critical. That shit stays with you even if you stop being involved with that individual and if they’re toxic or bad soul in general just imagine what you’re carrying around<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One thing I’ve learned is to stop holding onto people who would do anything to hurt me in relationships . People make choices but it’s your choice to stop accepting those poor choices . Love them from a distance and move forward . Fuck communication and shit some don’t deserve it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bad karma but not only that dude must’ve fucked over the first person and did everyone else after shady because he thought he’d get away with it<|endoftext|>
