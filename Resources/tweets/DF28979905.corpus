<|startoftext|>I'm starting a new movement to piss off liberals . Because they tried to crucify a kid accusing him of smirking in public. It's called the #smirktoo movement. Will you  #smirktoo for a cause.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@birdieminded @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump He's only offensive to those who oppose him.700 miles is obviously not enough. It's not only a physicle barrier but judges ,agents,electronics all opposed by Dems. He's got a plan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@birdieminded @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump It's not a monument to Trump . It's common sense! Something liberals don't have. It should have been built 50 yrs ago. The Dems voted for funding for a wall in the recent past. But Trump is POTUS so obstruction is the only course for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump #Democratobstructionist ! Take a poll from all 800,000 workers affected by the shutdown and ask them if they want the wall. I'll be willing to bet they'd vote for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@freedom_moates R u kidding ! These idiots in Hollywood don't know the meaning of the word. They are so out of touch with the common man.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@brithume My opinion is that The Senate and the House can't get anything done except letting criminals out of jail. What did Ryan accomplish? What has McConnell done ?oh yah Kavanah . What else . Immagration reform?Border security? Reducing the deficit. Nope nada nothing!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RagingGayCons No I wouldn't like it but if I loved my child I would have to accept his or her choice. However what I absolutely hate is the forcefull acceptance of the LGBT. Also I don't hate gays just because I don't understand what being gay is. Who am I to judge anyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelFIynn @realDonaldTrump I'm confused  .  You admitted to lying to FBI. You were representing the Turkish govt while serving in WH. You weren't charged.

<|startoftext|>@SymoneDSanders She could have been hit by a drunk driver and killed. But she was murdered by someone who was here illegally. It has nothing to do with masculinity and everything to do with murder.<|endoftext|>
