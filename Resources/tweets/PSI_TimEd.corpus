<|startoftext|>‘Moderate powers of the #EU’ were ones #UK had a say in and spent 40 years helping create  Powers were standards not barriers  Now we have no voice and are a small country trying to compete alone; workers have lost protection and people are subject to any rubbish foisted on them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is #BorisJohnson ‘planning for’ a no-deal #Brexit or actually engineering one?  These last minute talks look like window dressing to cover that this inept negotiator has been dispatched by #JacobReesMogg, #DominicCummings (he’s still around) #MichaelGove etc to deliberately fail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The consequences of #BorisJohnson’s inaction are bad enough but the fallout isn’t quite as bad as when he blunders about trying to take action<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews The stupidity is that #Britain sent #BorisJohnson, a man whose track on international negotiations is strewn with disaster, to negotiate the most fundamental political and commercial agreement in recent history.  Look at how he managed on behalf of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn’t an ’Australian Option’ another name for No Deal?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre #BorisJohnson never pointed out to the ‘Little Ingerlanders’ that any pile of shit is oven ready; this pile is called #Brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson gave a disgusting, unstatesman-like #HoC performance Making rabble-rousing statements about how tiny #UK will prosper trading against the world and using inflammatory language, blaming EU for his failure; saying EU doing it's normal procedures will be 'punishing' UK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gwcollinge Humility! Not in #BorisJohnson’s emotional range.  The only thing he knows about humility is how to fake it when he’s caught out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nobody was surprised by the allegations of #PritiPatel’s bullying.  It’s only people like Amber Rudd and #BorisJohnson’s cabinet who would take it for granted and try to pass off that sort of behaviour in a government minister as normal and acceptable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait for it! Wait for it!  Roll on the drums!  Last minute deal, rubbish but a deal, about to be pulled from the hat.  A #Brexit disaster compared to what #UK has but; because it’s edge of the cliff, backs to the wall, plucky Brits against the World, it will be sold as a triumph<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The problem with #BorisJohnson and his ‘oven-ready deal’ is that he does not know the difference between an oven and an incinerator.  His only concept of ovens is for putting buns in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Roll up! Roll up!  Get your #EU goods at pre-#Brexit prices  Only days for this chance of a lifetime, #Britain dying internationally, opportunity The only salvage sale before the disaster  Get your Miele, BMW and other EU made cars; Italian clothes; French food and so and so on..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mikesmith934 @GeorgeMonbiot After experiencing governments for 70+ years I can confirm this is the worst and the most divisive  I also realise that, not only do not rate as high value, I am of no value; except as a punter to be sold empty promises to get votes for #BorisJohnson and his gang of crooks<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MaximilianJans2 It will also be seen as a chance to resurrect #BorisJohnson, Britain’s philander-in-chief’s, flaccid reputation.  International negotiator he is not. Remember his hopeless performance as Foreign Secretary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaximilianJans2 You may be right; but the propaganda value of announcing a last minute deal and using the opportunity to swing blame for delays on the #EU is a chance our lie-through-their-teeth #Tory government will want to grab.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson is one of the biggest con men in recent #British history; it’s a strong field, just look at the current cabinet  Politically he’s a minnow; a Prime Minister history will only remember for his incompetence, corruption and the damage inflicted on the nation<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Unfortunately public inquires into this government of crooks will not happen. They'll make sure of that.  #BorisJohnson will use his standard phrase when challenged on his administration's apalling behaviour,  e.g. #DominicCummings and #PritiPatel: "The matter is closed"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Barking, how appropriate!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexiteers lied Situation normal then<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder if #PritiPatel knows how to curtesy and if she would have the manners to do so. On the other hand it’s a pretty demeaning acting in these times and #TheresaMay turned respect into grovelling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And do Shapps and Hancock, the well known comedy duo, honestly believe #Coronavirus cannot be caught in under 3 days and exposure through business travel abroad means the virus cannot be passed on within the #UK?  Maybe they think a business suit is a form of PPE<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Maybe #BorisJohnson's lockdown delay wasn't just incompetence and criminal negligence.

<|startoftext|>@sallywilts Absolutely right, government just printing money is a proven disaster route, it led to Germany’s early 20th century financial crash  Problem is government’s cavalier shovelling taxpayers’ cash to party donor companies, without following procurement rules and on unfounded projects<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, money Government distributes is extracted from taxpayers, notably ordinary working people  Problem is this #Tory  administration throws public money at private companies, Tory party donors, on wild schemes without proper procurement process while ordinary people need support<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So like #UK politics, #Tory government contracts for party donors and honours for their chums, all at taxpayers’ expense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No doubt #EU’s stance is based on saying to #BorisJohnson and his gang #Britain knows EU trading and social rules; it spent 40 years helping write them  #UK chose to make itself a foreign country so those are rules it abides by; why should ‘good old Blighty’ be a special case?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #UK government isn’t just failing the public, it’s conning them, and the conmeister-in-chief is in this picture<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can’t be - if #JacobReesMogg we’re involved it would be an engraving, a photograph is far too modern and plebeian.  And the #BorisJohnson lookalike knows the way to the barber (as well as the buffet)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What’s the betting Pestfix is a #Tory party donor?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No doubt contract was issued without competitive tendering; cornerstone of best value for public money and quality assurance Civil Servants would be sacked for ordering goods because they preferred a particular supplier, they were connected or received a back-hander<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So #JacobReesMogg trumpets the benefit of getting back the ability to not pay duty on a limited amount of goods that we don’t have to pay duty on as part of the #EU.  Maybe someone has invited Jacob Rees-Mogg on a booze cruise<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>People of #Kent have woken up to the truth that you should be careful what you wish for  Bravery of Kent #Brexiteers and those living in areas around ports have to be admired for sacrificing their property values, environment and #Britain’s future to their prejudices and phobias<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Unfortunately people seem happy to be told and vote for lies if they fit in with their prejudices and fears of missing out.  That's how #BorisJohnson and #Trump got into office and #NigelFarage managed to wreck #Britain's future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It wasn’t an urban myth; it was a lie invented by a defunct newspaper called the Sunday Correspondent.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>There won’t be a ‘No Deal #Brexit’  This crooked government will pull some last minute cobbled together arrangement out and claim it as a triumph over the #EU  #BorisJohnson and his gang of phonies are just manipulating the situation to make incompetence look like statesmanship<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Can anyone come up with one positive thing #BorisJohnson has achieved since becoming Prime Minister. Even if you’re a #Brexiteer he’s botched that.

<|startoftext|>Or maybe just ‘Dumb-ass anti-masker’<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And when anti-maskers turn up at hospitals with #Coronavirus symptoms they will still expect #NHS staff to save them despite their condition being self-inflicted.

<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre @EmmaKennedy But then Boris Johnson was a known liar, philanderer, waster of public money, self-serving buffoon and the great unwashed still voted him into the job<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Getting more like #Trump’s government by the day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Repeat - ‘The Prime Minister lied to children’.  #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Poppycock!! The algorithm wasn’t ‘mutant’. It did what it was designed to do under Dept for Education instruction and signed-off by the Minister #GavinWilliamson.  Is there any member of #BorisJohnson’s u-bend government with the decency to standby their actions, right or wrong?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s surprising #PritiPatel hasn’t licensed UKIP hardliners to go out mid-Channel and shoot holes in the refugee inflatable boats.  They could take bets on which side the bodies would wash up<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@docrussjackson You’re too kind to him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes #BorisJohnson, just go; and take Nadine Dorries with you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, we can recognise and regret the events of the past; #Britain’s embarrassment is the government of the present<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson’s government is throwing so much of #Britain down the toilet u-bends come naturally to them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What’s #BorisJohnson going to have to offer to get the same terms? The #NHS almost certainly, what else?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There probably are some prominent #Brexiteers who are widely respected and admired - but only by Brexiteers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s genetic. That’s why Stanley Johnson feels no embarrassment for having fathered #BorisJohnson.  As well as the genes there’s parental influence, guidance and example to blame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mixed feelings on children being sent back to school but ‘more likely to be hit by a bus’ concept doesn’t apply  It may be statistically correct but you don’t push your children in front of buses to increase the risk.

<|startoftext|>@jamesduquesnay @RebetikoWalrus @ThatTimWalker Cornish aren’t stupid but on #Brexit they were gullible. Within #EU Cornwall received 10%+ more than it contributed  There isn’t an immigrant influx; Brexit vote is based on propaganda about fishing quotas which Cornish have already sold to big corporations, listen to Rick Stein<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As #BorisJohnson and #Tories allow #DominicCummings to take #UK further down the US road Britain will be employee hostile.

<|startoftext|>@RebetikoWalrus @ThatTimWalker @jamesduquesnay That’s why the Cornish have become a laughing stock - they actually believed the #Brexit lies.  Proves you can fool all of the people (at least a whole county) some of the time.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson two-timing Carrie Symonds with a violinist is probably just a rumour.  What give the rumour credence is it would be typical Johnson. He abdicated running the country to #DominicCummings and, unlike Nero, he couldn’t even do his own fiddling while #UK burns<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The kind that wants to reduce the social care budget even for people who have spent their lives paying for it.  The kind of government that treats the people as punters to get money from and nuisances to have to support.  The New #Tories whose guiding principle is SELF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, Yes and Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The current administration blows away the idea of the #UK as a democracy.  #Tory #Labour #Liberal, however people voted it was for a parliamentary democracy. What they got was a token government of incompetents under the direction of an unelected dictator #DominicCummings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fully agree. It’s a pity that when #Remainers packed the city streets it resulted in no dialogue and total disregard from our own government, despite the #UK supposedly being a democracy, and ridicule from the media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A case of Jeremy Corbyn’s hubris. Thought he inspired the voters and they would follow his woolly plans.  Resulted in his handling the Tories an excessive election win despite their having a lying buffoon as a leader.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He’s 56 she’s 32 so he could be her father.  He’s a fat philandering liar with two broken marriages and at least five abandoned children. His current wife has been left while undergoing cancer treatment.  The attraction must be money, power or both<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For many over 75s, especially on low incomes, TV is essential to their lives.

<|startoftext|>Cornish knew before they voted for #Brexit that they got 10% more from the #EU than they contributed but they went ahead and shot themselves in the foot. Probably based on the hype about fishing rights which in reality the fishing industry have already sold to large organisations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson cut his holiday short because he realised he was staying in a cottage WITH HIS FAMILY.  It won’t last. Two failed marriages already, five or more abandoned children; maybe living with his girlfriend gives him a thrill but the novelty will wear off.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dbkell Planet Eton, Planet Harrow, Planet Roedean and so on; the alternative solar system of public school privilege.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because they’re friends of #DominicCummings and #MichaelGove and all the rules of probity in politics and public administration have been burned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When even the #DailyMail attacks a #Tory leader that person has to be truly incompetent and a national embarrassment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson can’t have run away to join a circus; he’s already got one he’s supposed to be running in Downing Street<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does this mean #DominicCummings is #BorisJohnson’s Steve Bannon?  Boris Johnson seems to be imploding like #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson may be hiding in a fridge again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only qualifications required to get a super-paid appointment from this government are to be linked to a #Tory donor or #Brexiteer and to be less competent than #BorisJohnson.  He needs dumb people about him so he looks adequate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NigelFarage and #PritiPatel would do their best to sink it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This sounds familiar.  Since he’s been Prime Minister every time there is a problem or crisis, usually brought about by his own government, #BorisJohnson is nowhere to be seen.  He either absents himself or Teflon-shoulders responsibility onto one of his inadequate Cabinet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now focus - I’m Carrie Symonds and you’re not doing this vacant dumb-arse act to pretend we’ve never met.  #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeighJC4 Corded - SEBO Battery - Miele (expensive but quality) or the G-Tec gets a good write-up, don’t be put off by the TV adverts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No need for #BorisHasFailedBritain to trend on Twitter - the fact that Boris Has Failed Britain is self-evident   #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing new under the Sun. Gaius Petronius at the time of Nero:  ‘We tend to meet any new situation by reorganizing, and a wonderful method it can be for creating the illusion of progress while producing confusion inefficiency, and demoralization.’  For Nero read #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Problem is the replacement.  The Cabinet are all repellent, either vicious or thick, or vicious and thick, and are voters who backed anti-immigrant #Brexit ready for #RishiSunak as Prime Minister?  Big gamble, especially without Jeremy Corbyn pushing voters away from #Labour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For #BorisJohnson it doesn’t matter. He’s ticked the ‘Become Prime Minister’ box on his Eton 4th form Things I Want To Do list and can go anytime  Gives the #Tories a problem. Johnson has proved inadequate; voters have seen through him and roguish bluster has lost its appeal 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And then they don’t ‘get on with it’ or they get on with something and it’s a disaster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We could start running a national sweepstake on the identity of the alleged rapist #Tory MP. Might flush him out because all the others will deny it.  Allegedly an ex-Minister but with the revolving Cabinet door #BorisJohnson has had there could still be quite a list to perm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the message is that #Trump assumes all media outlets, regardless of their core political preference, must support him personally and deny any other party or opinion a voice.  That’s not journalism it’s propaganda.  The actions of a despot not a democratically elected leader.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You don’t need an algorithm for that, just open a newspaper, listen to the radio or tv news<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrNobody8 Tomatoes- yeah right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alternative caption:  Damn! - I thought the algorithm our dads’ chums fixed would mean there’d be fewer state school oiks at university.  Even the great leader said it was robust but no one believed him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Civil Servants are not humble, even the lowest grade are the means by which the country functions.  Much maligned, and undermined by the government whose policies they turn into reality; the country would grind to a halt without them<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>A LITTLE bit crap??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How can #BorisJohnson’s entire premiership have been on holiday- it’s never been at work in the first place.  He abdicated leadership to #DomincCummings and gathered yes-men (and women) into a ramshackle cabinet so individually incompetent he looks better by comparison.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #MarkFrancois breaks cover one of the snipers might get him. Fingers crossed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xraypat @sideswiper They are would-be snake oil salesmen but associating #BorisJohnson and his corrupt gang with snakes in any form is a gross calumny on snakes. Every one of them could slide under a snake’s belly without waking it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sideswiper Ah, remember the old days when you hated #Tories just because of their policies. Now you hate them because they are despicable at an individual level. A party of barrow boys, out for themselves and the country can go hang. Trying to make #UK politics and government little America<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And with #BorisJohnson as PM he’d probably get it.  If you’re inadequate but want to look good surround yourself with yes men who are worse than you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tory politics:  Work hard Achieve good results Have your opportunities stolen Make someone else rich<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #BorisJohnson had any substance he wouldn’t need or even tolerate a #DominicCummings  Cummings is the power, Johnson is the buffoon mouthpiece and, when it all goes horribly wrong, as it is doing, and #Tories run out of excuses and scapegoats, the fall guy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson doesn’t care. He never expected to stay or achieve anything in the job  Becoming PM was box ticking on a career bucket list  He would’ve promised anything to get it, regardless of whether those promises could be fulfilled, and used the position to reward his funders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s #Trump-ism - the model for this government. Administration US style. Fancy names, political appointments to public offices, short time in office if you don’t follow the propaganda, attacks on professional civil service.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Who? With whom?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why doesn’t #GavinWilliamson save all that money and relieve all the anxiety by just accepting the teachers’ assessments and mock results?  Just refuses to admit they got it wrong; we’d have more respect if the government came clean and admitted a mistake<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Who says the exam algorithm was faulty?

<|startoftext|>@oldjumpers Or should that be #DominicRaab has been downgraded to #ChrisGrayling?  Same stupidity; pudding looks.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yes, 2020 A-level results are based on manipulated estimates and he’s the Education Secretary  You don’t need a better example of currying favour.

<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson’s government massaging of #COVID19 figures is no surprise and if deaths excluded are people who tested positive but definitely died of other causes (eg run over by bus) it’s fair  It doesn’t alter the appalling handling of the pandemic and government responsibility<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yes, the Daily Express, Daily Mail etc succeed by telling the bigoted what they want to hear, regardless of truth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly right.  The best thing #BorisJohnson can do to raise his appeal to the Scots is to stay well clear of #Scotland.  Unless he’s going there to make a public apology, as he had to with Liverpool<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hopefully Yaxley Lennon’s followers will be leaving the #UK by crossing the Channel in rubber dinghies to show the disparate would-be immigrants how it’s done.  There’s always the chance of capsizing or being overwhelmed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jimmy Saville was a #Tory; remember those pictures of him with Margaret Thatcher.  Saville wasn’t another version of the current Tory sex pest - he was a role model.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, #NigelFarage lacks as much compassion as a concentration camp commander<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not only is he stupid even his name is an affectation. He is George Iain Duncan Smith; no hyphen. So he is: George Smith Iain Smith  or Duncan Smith Rolling two names to look like a surname is verbal trickery to give a false impression of pedigree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We’ve already got a Mickey Mouse Prime Minister so practically anyone could do a better job; barring people from the same mould as #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Describes the whole of #BorisJohnson’s administration<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@susie_dent Should that be Trumpsimus?  #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not only is this #Tory twister political low life, he masquerades as Duncan(-)Smith.  There is no hyphen; people just assume it.  His name is George Iain Duncan Smith, so he should be George Smith, or Iain Smith, or maybe Duncan Smith.  George Smith, not so good on ballot papers?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somebody trusts #LiamFox with an account!  I wouldn’t trust him to cross the road safely with his pocket money and a note for teacher.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fbpe_jojo77 The rest of us. Gove and Vine deserve each other; it's just a pity they can't be tied up in a sack somewhere out of the way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acgrayling #Brexit fly-tipping to the House of Lords; nicely put<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davemacladd He’ll be sitting alongside Hoey, Botham and the chums, Lord Anon of Gropeland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeborahCoverda1 Old fashioned crooked marketing. They sell you the printer relatively cheaply, even though they are knocked out very cheaply in China, and then you’re locked in to buying the ink at a huge cost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn’t this the one who switched from ‘bollocks to #Brexit’ to ‘I love #Boris’ (or Theresa May) after some smooging from #Tory HQ?  Looks like another peerage coming down the line. No doubt he’ll be handing out his plumbing flyers round the House of Lords and offering a discount<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What was the #Tory whip telling the ex-Minister (unnamed) - how to get away with it?  As the best means of defence is attack look out for the denials and attempts to undermine the credibility of the victim<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh no! Does #PritiPatel think she or #BorisJohnson are going to re-run the Irish potato famine to get what they want!  Starve ‘em into submission or emigration to America. Except America means #Trump and they may well be closed to new admissions, even white ones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because he’s a #Tory politician  If he were a celebrity, Sir Cliff Richard say, or top military like Lord Bramall, his name would be all over the media and an out-of-his-depth copper would be making premature and untrue statements that they were guilty  But he’s a Tory politician<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Graveyards are full of them.  Not the Houses of Parliament and Downing Street has been declared a decency-free zone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre You can bet that in top #Tory-land they’ll be able to make their objections heard.  Imagine the likelihood of getting multi-story blocks of tickey-tacked flats built in, say, Chipping Norton<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Leaver lemmings- how appropriate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought #America was great until #Trump hijacked the Presidency.  It will be up to many subsequent #PoTUS to spend years undoing the damage to make America great again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has anyone engaged with a #Leave voter who has managed to convince themselves that #Brexit has ever been a good idea, let alone someone else<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThatTimWalker You can bet whatever #MarkFrancois is up to it's no good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Useful???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Johnsons - the family that put the #Tory into predatory<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It looks as if #Tory and ‘naughty’ mean the same. Only ‘naughty’ here is a euphemism for corrupt, crooked, lawbreaking, sexually predatory, self-serving, venal and so on.  Thought Jo Johnson was an exception but he’s now been sunk by his feet of clay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And such bare faced, brass necked corruption.  #BorisJohnson and his gang of thieves seem to be able to do what they like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He will be.  In the past sleeze was a resigning matter now it’s a qualification.  Crispin Odey will be able to discuss his sexual conquests with #Parliament’s official nose picker ‘Sir’ Iain Duncan Smith (is it Sir or Cur in this case?)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It would be comforting to think this is #BorisJohnson’s farewell list Unfortunately there will be a succession of blatantly political and donor appointments each new round of honours  How sad for people who work a lifetime and get an MBE or OBE and have the whole system cheapened<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He did the boy jobs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rewards to friends too public<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, Lord Cummings of Barnard Castle along with Lord Jacob Rees-Mogg of Snootyland.  With the limited capacity of the House of Lords, if all the existing lords and ladies were to arrive early, fill the seats and lock arms, the arrivistes would have to stay outside.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JONNY_LSF @MattHancock Could be quite a queue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Notice Aaron Banks and Tim Martin haven’t made it yet. Must be pencilled in for the next one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is knighting Theresa May’s husband a boy job or a girl job?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looked up Lebedev to see if he’s a UK citizen; he is and probably more committed to #UK than Kate Hoey, Claire Fox, Ian Duncan Smith or most #Tory sycophants on #BorisJohnson’s list  What’s interesting is Lebedev has a pet wolf called Boris; so he has two pets with the same name<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson making Evgeny Lebedev a Lord is his way of thrusting two fingers at the #RussiaReport  It’s a version of refusing to answer for his actions and just saying the matter is closed move on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Corruption! All is corruption!  Must have thrown Ken Clarke in to give this list spurious credibility.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry, is this a wind-up?  Has #BorisJohnson turned #UK into his personal fiefdom or is he trying to make #HofL so laughable and irrelevant it can be abolished?  Is there a price list for honours? So much support for OBE, so much for a knighthood, overt sycophancy for a peerage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bastards!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson is aping #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Being forced to wear a mask is an attack on the individual liberty to infect other people, including shop workers and health staff, and put yourself and your family at risk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TedUrchin Leaver - and we could only wish he would.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre Channel 5 ran an interesting programme a couple of days ago called How to stop nuisance calls. Can be viewed on the my5 catchup service Not a definitive instruction on how to stop them but gives good info on the background and how to deal with them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If our shambolic government can’t tell you what hope have we got of clarifying the situation?  Problem seems be Manchester etc being too far from soft #Tory-land for #BorisJohnson and crew to understand  Could be Eton teaches there are signs at Watford saying ‘Here ye be dragons’<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #BorisJohnson’s government’s track and trace system is world beating in inadequacy.  Its inconsistent and shambolic introduction of new lockdown in the North demonstrates that it doesn’t know its parliamentary arse from its administrative elbow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kieronfinn Slug<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely right, the second wave of #Coronavirus isn’t coming from Europe, it’s totally home grown.  At least #BorisJohnson has made the #UK self-sufficient in something.  Such an achievement; the #Brexiteers must be so proud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For a larger donation you could have a combined #Cummings card and peerage.  For a really large donation you can have a #Cummings card, a peerage and be Prime Minister.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #Tories have turned democracy back 100 maybe 150 years<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now we don’t have a car tax disk could we use the space for a #Cummings badge, a sort of ‘get out of jail free’ card for motoring offences, legal violations etc?  If caught we could have a garden press conference instead of a trial  A small #Tory party donation should get one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tommy Robinson, he could hold video briefings from his hidey hole in the #EU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wisheart12 Happy to make you smile.  The Boris Johnson and his corrupt administration do not respond to criticism, they just shrug their shoulders and say move on, so maybe ridiculing them may get a result.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If uber #Brexiteer Ian Botham gets to House of Lords will he still be doing daytime TV ads for vibrating appliances? Will he be Lord Revitive of Ingerland?  If supporting #Brexit gets a peerage will we have Lord Witherspoon of Boozeville? These bloody #Tories are so brazenly bent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dgfull @RevRichardColes @jayrayner1 @RyanRileyy Well, I’m very partial to Marmite so it’s not the same gene<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson is lying - no need to tweet that, it’s a given  ‘Boris Johnson is telling the truth’ now there would be a novelty worth spreading; only trouble is, as a pathological liar, if he told the truth would he be lying about it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RevRichardColes @jayrayner1 @RyanRileyy I’m a fellow sufferer. Coriander tastes like soap  Feel slightly miffed when TV chefs wax lyrical over putting heaps of the stuff in a dish  If those of us with the OR6A2 gene represent 10% of population can we claim to be a disadvantaged minority? Is there counselling available?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No chance. The lying is pathological<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexiteers are highly selective with the ‘will of the people’ schtick. It’s fine to charge ahead on the basis of a crooked #referendum producing a scant majority but if the will of the people of #Scotland is independence or #NIreland is Irish union it will be a different story<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Having looked at Tommy Robinson’s ‘shoes’ I would never have walked in them There is nothing that excuses or justifies his behaviour. He operates by firing-up hatred, prejudice and fear, just as Nazis did If you cannot see that, or worse, if you approve, then discussion is futile<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You are too kind to #BorisJohnson:  As Mayor of London he cost Londoners millions in vanity projects and worse.  As Foreign Secretary he achieved nothing and undermined international relations  As Prime Minister his actions are criminal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The butler mashing potatoes? Oh no, you mean the cook, or possibly one of the Under Kitchen Maids, whacking the spuds for the butler to present on a silver tray to Annunziata Rees-Mogg.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirdyBirdUK And shutting him out is a result of listening to his views.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirdyBirdUK Exactly the same. No external factors excuse his behaviour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If it’s #LizTruss she must have put the ‘for’ in by mistake<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCNormanS Does that mean you’ve been elbowed out for someone more right wing or a #Tory sycophant?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m suffering something similar and had to impose TV self-isolation. Every time #BorisJohnson or a member of his gang comes on, or on of their smug supporters, I want to throw something at it; and the TV is worth more that the whole #Tory government put together.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In other words, wear a bloody mask when you’re told<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre Yes, the wireless; that brown box with a warm glow when the valves light up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In previous times the #Tories got dragged through the mud for cash for questions - now it’s cash for answers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This £100,000 a year spokesman, will the taxpayer be funding him or her to do #BorisJohnson’s job and #DominicCummings’ bidding or are the #Tory party backers stumping up the cash?  £100k is just pocket money to a Russian oligarch after all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thought she already was<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just realised why #Trump wants to flog chlorinated chicken to the #UK - he thinks it's a cure for #Coronavirus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tommy Robinson seems to have time on his hands and has the right background to represent #DominicCummings and his puppet  #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spaceflight from #UK soil - why?  Someone in #Tories must be on the make or the party's on a promise from an aerospace industry backer  Will it be a Russian Chinese or US rocket?  Or will it be a UK rocket with #DominicCummings sending #BorisJohnson to light the blue touch paper?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirdyBirdUK There is no defending the indefensible Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, alias 'Tommy Robinson', isn't excusable on any front; not from way he was raised, if he'd a scrap of decency he'd have rejected any childhood conditioning  If his behaviour is genetic he needs treatment - or locking up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GrantShapps - a mug with a collection of mugs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, #Brexiteers can't explain it because it contains two concepts they don't understand: freedom and movement<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson hasn’t just prostituted himself for Russian cash, he’s done it to the whole country  This #Tory government sold the whole country for Russian money to get and keep power. Having been a tart to Russia they’re now willing to offer #NHS and who knows what else to #US<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BirdyBirdUK There’s opposing views, debate and argument, and then there’s hatred, bigotry and rabble-rousing.  The latter has never been part of civilised society<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, No, No, it’s taken so long to get rid of Tommy Robinson, don’t encourage him back.  #Britain’s loss is #Spain’s loss.  And he’ll be like a pig in sh*t carousing with the shaven headed Brits in the English bars and chip shops<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So little ol’ Ingerland comes top.  #BorisJohnson has recreated England in his own image- best at being worst.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spain can keep him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really or metaphorically?  #NigelFarage wears a ‘bloke down the pub’ and ‘I’m doing it for Ingerland’ mask but underneath he’s an evil sh*t  If he wore one to protect people from his germs it would interfere with the fags &amp; booze  Probably doesn’t wear one, he’s a bare-faced liar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good luck tackling obesity; it means behavioural change in a population that won’t even wear a mask to save their and others’ lives, possibly because it gets in the way of grazing and stuffing junk food<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There’s a dilemma for #BorisJohnson and his conniving crew.  Tackle obesity, making the nation healthier, relieving #NHS  Or let obesity run riot, putting extra strain on the NHS, which they are trying to wreck, but killing slobs off before they become a pension and care burden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those members of #Cabinet who haven’t made wads of cash in the City before taking the main chance in politics have got inherited estates to fall back on Even the Fuhrer #DominicCummings is pretty well setup  Pensions for the peasants are just a remote concept ‘Let them eat cake’<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And #Tories want to attack pensions generally; even though #UK pensions are almost worst in the industrialised world and we’ve paid for them all our working lives  With their golden handshake pensions assured #BorisJohnson and his gang of thieves are too insulated from reality<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #Conservative Party Manifesto.  Was going to say the UKIP manifesto but they only had one policy  and that could be written on one side of a piece of paper - a very small piece of paper, the sort that is absorbent and comes in rolls<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As well not expecting over-40s to pay for social care crisis, guard pensioners from having to pay for the financial fallout from #Coronavirus  #UK pension is already one of the worst in the industrialised world; now our government of incompetents is threatening to make it worse<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MickvanNergens Must be a rhetorical question<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or more to the point, if #Brexit was the answer it must have been a bloody silly question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Again @susie_dent provides the most appropriate word: #Britain is suffering ‘kakistocracy’ - government by the worst of citizens  Comes from Greeks who knew quite a bit and also had a word for #BorisJohnson #DominicCummings and the #Tory Cabinet ‘kakoethes’ - of evil disposition<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YvonneBurdett3 Left his wallet at home<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watch out #BBC, you are a sacrafificial lamb to #BorisJohnson’s cronies, or rather #DominicCummings’ malicious designs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because it’s the #BBC which has abandoned its Reithian standard of independence and now courts government favour.  It won’t work. Like all blackmailers, they take everything you can give them then do the dirty on you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These characteristics, which in any other organisation than the #Tory party would get a person sacked or prosecuted, are all embodied in our egregious PM and can be associated with Cabinet individually Eg is Priti Patel the self-serving hypocrite? It seems to apply to all of them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre @Splodgehappy Boris Johnson  Jacob Rees-Mogg Priti Patel  Dominic Raab Ian Duncan Smith Marc Francois  Oh so many  Parliament would be so much improved by just their absence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s a proven technique documented by the Nazis, if you tell a lie tell it big, keep telling it and soon people will believe it.  It’s standard #BorisJohnson #MichaelGove and other #Tory government practice; along with #NigelFarage and, of course, #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only time #BorisJohnson will be listed among the World greats - the greatest threats to peace, democracy, unity, World order and so on.  The best at being worst<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now #BorisJohnson even dresses as a bandit. No mistaking his intentions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #BorisJohnson is judged by his actions he’s sunk - and not a moment too soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The sub-heading says: ‘PM to stick upfor every corner of our nation’; it should read: ‘stick two fingers up’ to every corner of our nation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it possible #BorisJohnson switched from being a Remainer to a #Brexiteer following a payment from #Russia?  Was his commitment actually bought in a straight cash deal; the biggest brown envelope bung in history?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With all that’s going on this is trivial but is #BorisJohnson’s hair died? (nearly wrote lied)  Everything about him is fake; policies, sincerity, family life, just everything, he even relies on a paid advisor to make decisions for him. Is his trademark tousled hair phoney too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If a the headstone on a grave reads ‘Here lies Boris Johnson’ or even just ‘Boris Johnson’ there would be no way of telling if it were true. The only sure part is that #BorisJohnson lies; but he lies everywhere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why have a trade deal with #Russia? It appears they own us anyway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>P*ss*d off with #BorisJohnson and his rotten government but that’s no change from before the #RussiaReport  What on earth happened to the old #Tory party, the one which you didn’t like but had some statesmen and women? Now we have a government of barrow boys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DominicCummings must be a #Russian asset, he’s certainly not doing the #UK any favours<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the #Tory benches, though not exclusively there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So what’s the classification for those of us for whom 50 is a distant memory, that’s assuming the memory still works?  What happened to ‘60 is the new 40’; was that just to sell something?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is no way #BorisJohnson and #DominicCummings are going to let the full #RussiaReport into the public domain or even allow MPs to see it. They would impose every restriction they can to keep that document under wraps unless they had full chance to thoroughly fillet it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And what #America does today #Britain will do tomorrow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With #BorisJohnson in the bin? Please say you’ve consigned him to landfill<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More to the point - our government cannot handle the truth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So this #Tory MP is saying the #RussiaReport, which he has not read, is not factual and there has been no Russian influence or interference in #UK politics.  Where do the #Tories get these idiots? The #ChrisGrayling school?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So now we are governed by #DominicCummings and #AaronBanks.  It used to be just #RupertMurdoch was openly controlling government.  Looks as if the level of predators is sinking down the food chain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The way things are the #Tories won’t let us stop them privatising the #NHS.  They’ll clap for it and pour syrupy words one day then sell it down the river the next.  To be more accurate they’ll sell it to their chums and funders or use it as bargaining bait with #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me too. If staying in the #EU is the ‘will of the people’ in #Scotland and #NorthernIreland they should have the right to do so.  #Wales voted to leave but reality may have swayed opinion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Jeremy Corbyn hadn't been #Labour leader and handed the #Tories a massive majority, #BorisJohnson wouldn't have lasted a year.  Poor Jeremy Corbyn; laudable principles but no leadership appeal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More use to #Britain than hysterically right-wing, #Brexit supporting, sexually predatory, has-been sportsmen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As Hitler called his gang National Socialists ie Nazis.  So the #Tories, the Nasty Party, is at last coming clean as the Nazi Party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Money and power. Why else would an attractive woman be drawn to a fat proven liar and serial woman and child abandoner.  Money and power, the universal aphrodisiac; look at the ancient wrinkly Rupert Murdoch and Jerry Hall.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Questions are constantly raised about #DominicCummings but never answered When #BorisJohnson is challenged over Cummings’ actions, eg breaking lockdown and driving while he may have defective eyesight, Johnson and any of Cabinet just swerve the question and say ‘matter is closed’<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LastGaspPM Their own bank balances<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In plain language the opportunities of #Brexit are a myth while disadvantages are totally real<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And tell me madam, who’s this little lad and do you think he’ll vote for me?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre @SamanthaMalin They’d probably claim little Wilf had been packed off to Eton.  Boris Johnson has walked out on or abandoned six plus children already. If little Wilf is real we can only hope he fairs better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson has never had any authority; bluster and spite possibly.  Dominant #DominicCummings, now there's someone the inadequate Prime Minister has given authority.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre @SamanthaMalin He's a headline grabbing myth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's doubtful that #BorisJohnson and his know-nothing government have a clue of all the ways #Brexit will harm #Britain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Problem is #BorisJohnson thinks #Coronavirus is something to do with a soft drink.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because Captain Tom got the media attention.  Three cheers for both of them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This man’s a hero in his community but a retired cricketer who does advertisements on daytime TV is rumoured to be in line for a knighthood for supporting #Brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shoot-ourselves-in-the-foot #Cornwall voted for #Brexit even though the county got 10% more out of the #EU than they contributed. You get what you vote for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s unlikely even #Express #Telegraph or #Sun take #BorisJohnson seriously; they’re just ideologically opposed to supporting an alternative It’s any buffoon as long as he’s #Tory  Also, it’d mean admitting boosting Boris when he was gagging to be Prime Minister they got it wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrjamesob Being #BorisJohnson. No other skills. A career littered with expensive failure but that's ok as the failures were all at someone else's expense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre A pastey blob of lard with ragged hair stuck on a horse.  Poor horse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Regarding Carrie, with his track record #BorisJohnson has probably already elbowed her out to make room for a new squeeze.  Poor Wilf.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Banging the dispatch box is part of the act, like closed fist gestures; all an attempt to look the macho leader rather than an incompetent twerp  It's #BorisJohnson's version of bare chested horse riding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just another poll, like the last election or the #Referendum  #MichaelGove<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson is the best at being worst; and the more he practices the worse he gets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely right. #BorisJohnson has managed to become No1, top of the list in at least one measure -  he’s the most despicable #PrimeMinister in #British history.  No matter which is your personal hate figure of any party back to Cromwell; Boris tops the lot at being the worst<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Face it, Epsom and Ewell would have voted #Tory if they had put up a donkey dressed as a ventriloquist’s dummy - oh, they did, #ChrisGrayling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Errr.. No. #BorisJohnson has known about Russian interference since he received the #RussiaReport, probably before; he just would not admit it to #Parliament and the people.  And we, the people, paid for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Valerie3Ward Dominant Charlatan   #DominicCummings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexiteer face mask objector<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump uses the same technique. It works on prejudice, self-interest and any perception that an individual has missed out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Researchdogbody Not a problem with your punctuation; I just read the tweet too quickly. Anything that includes #ChrisGrayling automatically implies failure or a c*ck up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmm......two defenders of democracy. No wonder #DominicCummings and #BorisJohnson hate them.  That’s Dominant Cummings and Bluffer Johnson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the parliamentary equivalent of #DominicCummings frog marching a senior aide out of Downing Street.  #BorisJohnson and #DominicCummings’ style morphs more into the Nazis daily<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mis-read this tweet as ‘Chris Grayling failed to get electric chair’.  First thought Failing Grayling couldn’t even get himself executed.  #ChrisGrayling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or: Cummings: Ah, Chris, about your new job Grayling: What new job? C: I’m - sorry - We’re putting you in charge of HS2 quality control. G: Ooh goody, chuff chuffs. What do I have to do? C: When the first train leaves we want you to lay across the track and listen to it coming<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mid-read this tweet as ‘Chris Grayling failed to get the electric chair’. First thought was he’s too incompetent to even get himself executed. #ChrisGrayling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We can only hope that ordinary #Tory MPs are finally so embarrassed by their own leadership that they are starting to rebel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe there’s a ‘Dumb and Leaky Committee’ Failing Grayling can chair.  #ChrisGrayling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson probably wants to spend less time with the family. At least the latest mother and child.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s if #DominicCummings and #BorisJohnson cannot find a way of blocking publication of the #RussiaReport<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you are incompetent but want to hide it you surround yourself with people who are worse than you.  #BorisJohnson is a text book example of this reprehensible character trait; just look at people he’s fired or edged out of #Cabinet.

<|startoftext|>It’s because #PritiPatel wants to look as if she has street cred; she thinks bad pronunciation will go down well with the ‘init’-level voters. This is presentationally futile as she has no ‘cred’ on the street or elsewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not all bad then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congratulations #Brexiteers, you’ve made #Britain ‘the weakest link’. If only we were part of a major trading block with political links to give us some clout.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Though anecdotal evidence shows the majority of people now want to #remain; there will come a day when most of the population realise we’re better off within the #EU.  Unfortunately that will be the day after we fully leave the EU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There would be no value in a warning light that was permanently on. #BorisTheLiar #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#MattHancock’s instruction to shop workers to call the police if people refuse to wear masks wouldn’t sound quite so stupid and impractical if the #Tories hadn’t cut 20,000 police.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Marching backwards to 18th century #Tory ‘traditional values’, such as hanging for petty theft<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It wouldn’t be too difficult to make London a separate state within #EU.

<|startoftext|>An iron mask?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, #US is demanding unacceptably lax standards for food; you can bet the deal will be #Uk buys 50 US items for every one  US buys of ours. #China is planning sanctions because of UK's refusal to buy #Huawei That puts all hope on #Japan; no doubt #BorisJohnson can screw that up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's another one off the 'acceptable supplier' list, #Dyson being first to be deleted.  Never liked going to #Dunelm anyway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing is safe in #BorisJohnson's hands. Not the country, not the people, certainly not the #NHS or the #BBC.  Even Carrie Symonds doesn't trust him holding young Wilf.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's an interesting role reversal.  Previously people were scared in banks and shops when masked men came in because it was a robbery.  Now the scary ones will be those without a mask because it's an infection.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There have been so many policy reversals under this government, as they eventually see sense, we have a new dance: 'The Boris U-turn'.  Pity #BorisJohnson and his cronies can't see sense over #Brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If it's #DominicCummings in a retail premises it will be an optician's.  Oh no, silly me, if he needs a eye test he'll go to the car showroom.  Wherever he goes he will be above wearing a mask. An unelected person with such power will just command the #Coronavirus away.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FrisianAlliance @waggingfinger1 @VintiquesMark I don’t believe him at all. Britain will be worse off suffering from Brexit and I don’t believe it will take 50 years to recover- we will NEVER recover  If you’re prepared to follow people who tell you what you want to hear you have to give the other things they say credibility<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrisianAlliance @waggingfinger1 @VintiquesMark It’s not a matter of cherry picking, either you believe JR-M or you don’t. If you believe his statement that you will be better off with Brexit then you have to believe it will actually take 50 years to recover. So you, your children and grandchildren will be disadvantaged<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrisianAlliance @waggingfinger1 @VintiquesMark Jo Cox shooting was a terrible manifestation of one end of Brexit supporter spectrum; akin to Hitler’s Brown Shirts.

<|startoftext|>@FrisianAlliance @waggingfinger1 @VintiquesMark Do some research into election psychology and strategy; polling day variables are a considerable factor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrisianAlliance @waggingfinger1 @VintiquesMark No one was prevented from expressing their opinion in theory but, for example, Nigel Farage got far more air time than Remainers, Look at the number of times he was on Question Time when he doesn’t represent a constituency and his rag bag ‘party’ has no MPs.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Is this going to be a track and trace app for lorries? Has a contract already been issued without competition? Is the company running it a #Tory party donor or is the owner a chum of #BorisJohnson?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When it all goes belly-up #Brexiteers will be in denial and keep repeating ‘we won, get over it’ or some variant Getting people voting for things that actually harm them is a technique used by #Trump and #Farage.

<|startoftext|>As with the prosecution of all of that gang it gets ignored then forgotten That’s why #DominicCummings hasn’t been prosecuted for breaking lockdown; driving while suspecting he has faulty eyesight, therefore invalidating his insurance; having a cottage without planning permission<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson has a track record from 2004 and before of repeatedly making offensive remarks about #Liverpool.

<|startoftext|>It appears the ‘oven ready deal’ for Brexit had gone mouldy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And #BorisJohnson is letting #DominicCummings loose on the#UK’s defence forces. Or more likely Cummings has told Boris that’s his next target and to stand aside while he gets on with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like #TimMartin has been drinking the profits and it’s addled the brain. Raving, utterly raving.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrisianAlliance @waggingfinger1 @VintiquesMark If you regard blatant lying, manipulation, stoking prejudices, and general underhand activities as ‘campaigning’ then Brexiteers campaigned. It is true that Remainers did not try hard enough and assumed people would not be daft enough to shoot themselves in the foot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrisianAlliance @waggingfinger1 @VintiquesMark Statement that UK MPs are among the lowest paid in the world is dubious, do you have a reference for that? They’re not lowly paid by comparison to national incomes £82k basic plus countless expenses and loads of external appointments  If it were poorly paid there’d be no Tory MPs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrisianAlliance @waggingfinger1 @VintiquesMark That sounds like paranoia. Britain participated in all the actions of the EU and you said it couldn’t make laws. Name one law or regulation passed by the EU that has disadvantaged you personally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrisianAlliance @waggingfinger1 @VintiquesMark I do my best to avoid Jacob Rees-Mogg, I paid too much for the TV to throw things at it; but sometimes he says things that stand out like a rare truth among the sea of Brexit lies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrisianAlliance @waggingfinger1 @VintiquesMark I think JR-M is despicable but he’s a leading exponent of Brexit, a flawed concept, so if you believe him on Brexit then you have to accept that it will take half a century for UK to recover I believe him on that, I wouldn’t have believed if he’d said it’s all going to be rosey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrisianAlliance @waggingfinger1 @VintiquesMark The good weather probably did not favour either side; but inevitably a poll is a snapshot of voting on the day, affected by many factors. These have significance in elections or referenda where they majority is slender; whereas a strong majority is a reasonable gauge of intention<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrisianAlliance @waggingfinger1 @VintiquesMark I agree Fixed Term Parliament Act should never have been passed and campaigning is tedious. The most depressing words on the TV are ‘And now a party political broadcast’. But elections are never called for the next day or the next week; I’ve lost the point you are trying to make<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrisianAlliance @waggingfinger1 @VintiquesMark Whatever the outcome if it’s wrong it’s wrong. Wrong for the country and wrong for the individual. You can’t just shrug your shoulders and say well they voted for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right! You get what you collectively vote for.  ‘Be careful what you wish for’ goes back to Aesop’s Fables; unfortunately people don’t listen or learn<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The number of #coronavirus deaths seems to have fallen off (or been suppressed from) the headlines. It looks as if we are expected to accept a daily #Corvid19 death toll of around 140 as just normal.  That’s nearly 1000 families a week grieving.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So much like our own Prime Minister ##BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#UK has industrialised world’s worst pension, certainly worst in Europe, now #BorisJohnson wants to remove triple lock to make it worse, after we’ve spent a lifetime paying for it Cash’s been thrown about without scrutiny &amp; poured into bogus schemes just because it’s public money<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s coming from ordinary tax payers; the rich are adept minimising tax they pay and this #Tory government is keen to give its chums tax breaks Mainstream taxpayers will be paying for generations for cash that’s been thrown about and #BorisJohnson has pensioners in his sights<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FrisianAlliance @waggingfinger1 @VintiquesMark All parliaments can be accused of being overpaid and a talking shop, it’s just better that having a corrupt dictatorship, which looks like the way we are going at the moment.

<|startoftext|>@FrisianAlliance @waggingfinger1 @VintiquesMark That’s why they resort to picking people up by car and driving them to the polling station. It’s known that bad weather favours the Tories, probably less so nowadays as it was based on Labour voters not having cars, no longer the case, but Election Day weather has an effect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrisianAlliance @waggingfinger1 @VintiquesMark Unless people can be forced to vote, herded into polling booths, all elections etc are snapshots, subject to variables.  Voters know years in advance when the next election will be but political parties are acutely aware that the outcome can depend on conditions on the day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrisianAlliance @waggingfinger1 @VintiquesMark Err..yes, do you have a problem with that? If result had been remain by only a few % would you just slink away? Democracy is supposed to be based on people being given facts and making a choice. This time they were presented with lies and myths, just taken for a bunch of punters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrisianAlliance @waggingfinger1 @VintiquesMark There is no verifiable evidence that Britain will be one dot better off as a result of Brexit. It’s all fluff and promises, smoke and mirrors. The UK isn’t just falling off a cliff, it’s jumping out of a perfectly good plane without a parachute because it doesn’t like the airline<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrisianAlliance @waggingfinger1 @VintiquesMark Err..the EU wasn’t undemocratic; the UK used to have a leading role in it and everyone could vote for an MEP to represent them, if they bothered. It’s not a matter of waiting 50 years for something to work out; there is no evidence it will work out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrisianAlliance @waggingfinger1 @VintiquesMark And the reason Jacob Rees-Mogg gave for moving is that ‘Ireland is set to out-perform the UK’<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrisianAlliance @waggingfinger1 @VintiquesMark There are too many sources; it was reported in newspapers and you can actually see Jacob Rees-Mogg saying it will take 50 years for Britain to recover from Brexit on You-tube. Just Google it. There is a report of him moving his firm to Ireland in, for example, the Independent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrisianAlliance @waggingfinger1 @VintiquesMark The problem with such a slim majority is, not only the basis on which it was achieved, but its fragility. Another day, a few more people getting off their backsides to vote, etc etc. Unlike the 1975 referendum where the vote to join was about double those wanting to stay out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrisianAlliance @waggingfinger1 @VintiquesMark But we are leaving on the basis of 52%. The problem is the dodgy basis on which the 4% difference was achieved; largely lies, manipulation, stoking up people’s feelings of being left out, anti-immigration; external interference; all the lowest grade dirty tricks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrisianAlliance @waggingfinger1 @VintiquesMark Fifty years, that means not only people now are going to suffer from Brexit, their children and grandchildren will be disadvantaged too, dragging those of the people who wanted to remain down with them.  That’s national self-abuse on an epic scale<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrisianAlliance @waggingfinger1 @VintiquesMark You can’t have it both ways Jacob Rees-Mogg is a leading Brexiteer, senior member of government and a financier Although the government keeps him in the shadows these days because he’s an embarrassment, he was one of the people referred to when predicting the effects of Brexit -<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrisianAlliance @waggingfinger1 @VintiquesMark Every economist predicted UK financial downturn after Brexit, Rees-Mogg even shifted his HQ to Ireland to stay in EU. Financial predictions are worse now because of pandemic There are lots of sources for R-M’s prediction Google: jacob rees mogg 50 years to recover from brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrisianAlliance @waggingfinger1 @VintiquesMark Why would we have left if there had been a 52% vote to remain?  Only Farage would have been stirring for a re-run, everyone else would have shrugged their shoulders, thought the whole thing was a waste of time and money, then got on with life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waggingfinger1 @VintiquesMark of disagreeing minor countries hoping the US and rest of the world won’t be too hard on us  EU is strong as an economic and political force for its members and proof against outside attack. If it fails it will be through traitors from within. Sad to think of my country as that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waggingfinger1 @VintiquesMark We didn’t join the Euro etc because we had the power and authority(sovereignty) to do so; fighting didn’t come into it  Britain in EU, or EEC if you want to live in the past, was GREAT Britain, an experienced nation with a pan-Europe voice. Now we’re just a self-harming rag bag -<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or even Chair of the Intelligence Committee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Presumably #DominicCummings wants #ChrisGrayling in the job because his disasters to date mean he’ll do as he’s told.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the ultimate ‘jobs for the boys’.  Publicly humiliated as Transport Secretary, demonstrably incompetent, known even at school as ‘Failing Grayling’, he’s in line to be Chain of the Intelligence Committee.  ‘Grayling’ and ‘intelligence’, shouldn’t be in the same sentence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waggingfinger1 @VintiquesMark Empires that have fallen through history, eg Roman, Ottoman,  Reich, due to outside forces, invaders, etc  British saw the way the world was going and gave up its empire, after a few scraps it realised it couldn’t win  EU is a voluntary union, one part can quit without it ending<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waggingfinger1 @FrisianAlliance @VintiquesMark Older people who voted join were living in dire state of UK, that we couldn’t survive relying on an empire that no longer existed, and they had fought a war because of disunity EU would remove Law making was part of deal and it mainly affects product standards and human rights<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waggingfinger1 @VintiquesMark The fact UK did not adopt the Euro demonstrates that we still had the sovereignty Brexiteers bang on about. The loss of sovereignty was a propaganda myth. That’s why we still had our own Parliament. One of the benefits of the Euro is not having to faff about exchanging currencies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waggingfinger1 @VintiquesMark Your right Remainers knew the EU benefits and assumed others realised it too They hadn’t reckoned with Farage and the like who play on people’s feeling of being disadvantaged or left out. It’s a way of getting people to vote for things that actually harm them. Trump does the same<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely right, the world has moved on since the 1970’s and so has the EU. Everything develops, you couldn’t freeze the EU as the cosy EEC club, and Britain has benefited from it.  Much of the work of the unions has been superseded by EU workers’ rights and protection<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waggingfinger1 Yes the EU have much higher food standards than, for example, the US. If any mis-selling of meat is detected it is rooted-out. The scandal a few years ago about horse meat being found in some processed foods were items manufactured in the UK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrisianAlliance @waggingfinger1 @VintiquesMark Even despicable Jacob Rees-Mogg stated that it will take 50 years for UK to recover from Brexit.  That means the majority of people alive now will be dead before benefits are felt, if there are any, and future generations are cursed with this shoot-yourself-in-the-foot decision<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrisianAlliance @waggingfinger1 @VintiquesMark About same population proportion voted in 1975 and 2016. Difference is 75 majority to join Europe was overwhelming, unlike 2016 when vote to leave was marginal  Do Remainers include non-voters? That’s news. It’s true many didn’t bother because they didn’t think Leave was credible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waggingfinger1 @VintiquesMark The EEC came as a package, if the political element became higher profile Britain had a leading part in it. Now we’ve got nothing. And while there has been a political element to Europe which gave us collective power, the UK still had its own Parliament and made its own laws.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh well, as far as #BorisJohnson is concerned it's only public money.  If the #Tory government had forced their billionaire supporters to fund a track and trace system you can bet the business savvy funders would have insisted on scrutiny of spending and proper contract protocols<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And who are we relying on as the front line negotiator for these arrangements? #LizTruss - abandon all hope.

<|startoftext|>Presumably chlorinated chicken isn’t the only low grade food #UK will be exposed to as #BorisJohnson abandons all standards of protection in sucking up to #Trump for a deal  It’ll be #China next, will we be expected to accept wild animal meat from their street markets as normal?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@waggingfinger1 @VintiquesMark It came as a whole deal and #Britain used to have a leading voice in European politics. Now it’s just a powerless foreign country at the mercy of #America #China #Russia and the #WTO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrisianAlliance @waggingfinger1 @VintiquesMark And, of course, there was Russian interference. Sorry, #Brexiteers, you were duped, now we are all suffering.  And the 67% who voted to join the #EU in 1975 knew we’d be better off and we have been for 40+ years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrisianAlliance @waggingfinger1 @VintiquesMark Referendum was won on blatant lies, eg #BorisJohnson’s bus claim of money for NHS, and manipulation by Farage and others of people’s prejudices and feeling they’d been left out. It was a largely anti-immigrant vote Majority was tiny; unlike 1975 where people voted 67% to join #EU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DominicCummings should be subject to security vetting first.

<|startoftext|>Actually, Larry the Downing Street cat has the edge on #BorisJohnson.  At least Larry keeps the vermin out of Downing Street. Boris consorts with them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Larry the Downing Street cat would make a better Prime Minister than #BorisJohnson, so claiming the no-deal loving, tax dodging #RishiSunak is a better candidate than the present incumbent isn’t saying much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who is #DominicCummings to be undertaking a military review??  Who appointed him? Who voted for him?

<|startoftext|>Just found a word new to me ‘pinguid’ - ‘of the nature of or resembling fat; oily or greasy’.  So, we have: Pinguid #BorisJohnson  Pinguid #MarkFrancois  Pinguid #CrispinOdey  Then there’s Pinguid #JacobReesMogg, qualifies by being oily or greasy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe #LizTruss is worried about mass smuggling of delicious foreign cheeses she was so concerned over a while back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks as if Minister #NadineDorries is demonstrating that she doesn't know the meanings of Minister, Mental Health, Suicide, Prevention, Patient and Safety.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's an age-old technique when someone with high profile is an embarrassing incompetent; they are promoted out of the way where they can do less damage.

<|startoftext|>If #MarkFrancois represents that sort of constituency the #Tories could have put up a stuffed baboon for parliament - oh, they did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Presumably #MarkFrancois is MP for #Brexit-on-Sea<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DominicCummings isn't the puppet  - he's the puppet master.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As #BorisJohnson is a known career compulsive liar we can only assume people voted for him because they found is stream-of-conscience fantasy spiel amusing.  Rather in way people watched Bernard Manning telling racist jokes.  Or did the vote for him because he's not Jeremy Corbyn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MarkFrancois reveals the government attitude to #DominicCummings. He's their combined master, fixer and bogeyman. None of the #Cabinet or government members have power; if they can't get their own way through policy or authority they send in #Cummings the Terminator.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Europeans have gone home and we're stuck with British workmen charging a fortune<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are candidates from other countries; nominating #LiamFox is a way of reducing chances of getting the job and putting #UK in the firing line  WTO is an international body,  #BorisJohnson and his gang would find it much more difficult to lie and avoid taking responsibility<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@houldall @VintiquesMark I’m older than that and vehemently opposed to #Brexit  What is so infuriating about #Brexiteer pensioners is that they are old enough to remember the terrible state the #UK was in before we joined the #EU and they are prepared to condemn future generations to that bleak outlook<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Fransfedup No, I used to be middle-of-the-Road, fairly a-political; tolerance of the #Tories became dislike and has developed into hatred.  It is easy to see now how people become radicalised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By ‘great track record with diversity’ does #MattHancock mean #BorisJohnson includes token representatives of various groups in his rag bag Cabinet based on personal characteristics rather than ability? He’s pretty bad at it, eg, there are many better women MPs than #PritiPatel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We should call these mass, un-socially distanced, #Corvid19 spreading gatherings ‘’Cummings out parties’  #DominicCummings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How many firms will use #Coronavirus as an excuse to cut jobs, close premises and put up prices? It’s a great cover to cut a workforce without argument, make people work from home, robbing them of social interaction of work, and increase retail costs. Then we’ll have #Brexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#StanleyJohnson #DominicCummings These people are so close to #BorisJohnson yet even they have no respect or support and cannot be bothered to obey the rules.  Or is it that they think they are a different species and can do as they please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There’s an old adage, more a universal truth, that as far as government is concerned you never believe any rumour until it has been officially denied. #BorisJohnson and has gang have extended that; now you don’t know anything is a lie until the government officially announces it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The lies are the only transparent thing this government does.  You can see straight through everything #BorisJohnson and the rest of the Cabinet says.  Try to get to data, facts and the truth, the #RussiaReport for example, and everything is opaque or smoke and mirrors<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fully agree.  No doubt #NigelFarage and his xenophobic band of anti-immigrant #Brexiteers must be pleased at the prospect of all those Hong Kongers landing in #Britain for sanctuary and a new life.  That's if the #Chinese will let them out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only thing I want to hear from #BorisJohnson is “Goodbye from #DominicCummings and me for ever”  Maybe that should be “Goodbye from Dominic Cummings and I” but as long as he goes who cares about grammar?  Government in #Britain would be vastly improved by just their leaving<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheresaMay was a terrible #PrimeMinister, a dreadful Home Secretary (though Priti Patel is worse) but it seems she has found her role at last as critic of her own #Tory government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That should read ‘a short version of the #RussiaReport will be published someday’. ‘Short’ meaning with all entries that detail the hold #Russia has over this government, how the #Referendum and last election were manipulated, and why #BorisJohnson has hidden it so far taken out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With his 80 majority #BorisJohnson is running mad destroying #Britain and trying to turn it into little #America  We have to look to the #Tory MPs to save us from within government. Problem is they are running scared of #DominicCummings, the man with no conscience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two miracles, agreeing with #TheresaMay and looking to Piers Morgan to be the one challenging government. How the world changes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the weasel words in #BorisJohnson’s speech mean that Sites of Special Scientific Interest, ecological and environmental considerations are meaningless and the country is now a free for all for property developers.  For ‘property developers’ read ‘#Tory donors’<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It appears #MarkFrancois hasn’t noticed that we elect our own government, including him; make our own laws, if not what are we paying 650 people generating hot air in Westminster for; and, apart from the occasional riot, we live in peace.  Which country has he been living in?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, #UK populus (or a narrow margin of those who bothered) voted to close borders to Europe and make itself a foreign country. #Scotland and N Ireland had more sense; if they don’t want to be dragged down by #England (or Farage’s Ingaland) they should have right to close borders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh yes! - the #Tory government ‘unasinous’, united in stupidity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shows how far #Britain has sunk.  #LiamFox<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, the administration in the #US is politically appointed and look at the mess that’s created.  One of the great things about #British government is the continuity and integrity of the Civil Service.  It’s the politically appointed part that stinks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Once in power Thatcher set about the destruction of a great deal of national infrastructure, deregulated most industries, sold off national assets to private owners and generally facilitated a gimme gimme selfish state. #BorisJohnson is doing the same, guided by #DominicCummings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Playing with itself - a suitable analogy for #BorisJohnson’s government<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson’s blatant refusal to release the #RussiaReport confirms the content is harmful to his government and their pet project #Brexit.  Or is it another of his cunning stunts; keeping an innocuous report secret as a dead cat distraction from other wrongdoing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely right; these are publicly funded so papers should be in the public domain.  The #RussiaReport was publicly funded and it should also be in the public domain.  Who’s going to submit the Freedom of Information request or should we flood the system with them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Tory Party Conference is scheduled for Birmingham in October. Looks as if it's going to be #BorisJohnson's first whipping up the faithful in style of Nazi Nuremberg Rallies.

<|startoftext|>@jayrayner1 That’s no help. Not to comment doesn’t indicate whether you have not been to the restaurant or that it’s not up to scratch. If you’ve visited but not commented it could be something trivial such as a salty sauce or there could be rats in the kitchen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No decent person supported #Brexit in the first place<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That what #PritiPatel is. Only she hasn’t been taught to speak properly, just in an affected ‘posh’ accent. As the old saying goes, you can’t polish a t*rd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Possibly not a wise analogy. A butcher’s dog gets fat profiting from trimming from edges off goods other people have paid for. For other people read taxpayers And a butcher’s dog may be fat but not necessarily fit; as with #BorisJohnson. Maybe he’s just looking for his conscience<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Regrettably many people did, though they were kept ignorant of the facts, and most of them were pensioners who should have know better.  Goes against the idea that wisdom comes with age.  #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre It appears Carrie Symonds has locked him out of the bedroom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson’s whole demeanour is a mask  Tousle-topped blustering buffoon hides a self-serving, child abandoning elitist who cares for himself and the interests of those like him  Like #Trump he has the cunning to play voters to get him a position he is incompetent to manage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You forgot to point out Civil Service told #RobertJenrick to comply with proper standards of behaviour for officials, follow ministerial code, apply due diligence and demonstrate avoidance of conflicts of interest.

<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre Sometimes you look at what’s happening in #Britain, how we are being shafted by our own government; abysmal standards of behaviour of politicians; partisan press; thoughtless, selfish behaviour of people generally, then drinking until you pass out seems like a reasonable option😩<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The Queen was forced to give up Royal Yacht Britannia which had multiple uses, including as a training ship and floating promoter for #Britain, she also gave up the Queen’s flight of dedicated secure aircraft but #BorisJohnson awards himself an aeroplane in custom colours.<|endoftext|>

He can fly in a plane any colour he likes as long as we taxpayers don’t have to pay for the paint job. We’ve got better uses for the money; nurses salaries will do for a good start.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Smell of rotting corruption pervades everything this government does.

<|startoftext|>Yes, of course. No need to even ask.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely right. Not publishing the pictures demonstrates how much the #BBC has become an arm of the government, something it’s original Director General refused to accept. Would #ITV news or Channel 4 show them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too true. Much as Margaret Thatcher was loathsome she wouldn’t have tolerated #Jenrick or #Cummings.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It’s all a matter of where you stand. Compared to #NormanTebbit #JacobReesMogg #DominicCummings and the like, Hitler was a soft ol’ pinko leftie. Don’t include #BorisJohnson, he’s just a rubber stamp for his controllers, doesn’t matter what he thinks; if he thinks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To be in #BorisJohnson’s cabinet means you are less capable than Boris Johnson. Resigning casts yourself into the abyss so who would do it? Alternatively, being sacked from Boris’s cabinet indicates he considers you more capable than he and therefore a threat. Quite an accolade<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kel_audio If you’re an MP, one of the elite, or a large corporation you can abuse the system to your heart’s content and get away with it.  Kill ten people you’re a mass murderer, kill 40-60,000 by your actions you’re a Prime Minister<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kel_audio You don’t get the situation; you can get away with anything in #Britain if it’s the right size As an ordinary self-employed person, if you hit hard times, have trouble covering your NI, VaT, or taxes you will be ruined by the system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#RobertJenrick's releasing of (highly redacted) documents concerning his overriding a major  planning decision in favour of a #Tory party donor is reminiscent of Saddam Hussein giving up his chemical weapons when he was cornered, like Jenrick he didn't tell all the truth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Tory government and 'common sense' - two concepts that do not fit in the same sentence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't be silly. Experience so far shows #DominicCummings is fireproof.  He can break the law, abuse regulations, even announce in public that he drove his car suspecting he had deficient eyesight and at a time when he should have been locked down in London but just shrug it off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mr Speaker - oh how we need John Bercow now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Slightly??  #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohannaSaunders @annehadet1 I'm old enough to remember when a Prime Minister had to have a degree of integrity and statesmanship (or statespersonship) and considered themselves answerable to the House of Commons They also took their own decisions, not acting as the mouthpiece for an unelected paid 'advisor'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit was like a bereavement of a close family member.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Carlabela1 @annehadet1 I switch off because I paid too much for the television to throw things at it if #BorisJohnson is contaminating the screen.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson leading from the rear as usual.  Government #Corvid19 policy just legitimises what the crowd are doing anyway.  With a bit of slight of hand this crook and his gang will try to make it appear that people ignoring the 2 metre rule is a government concession<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A #Tory cabinet minister.  Who commissions a report funded with public money on Russian interference in #UK elections and the #Referendum and then won’t let the public see it?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre It could be a Cat Burglar Snail (Helix Felonius), possibly a mountaineering snail (Helix Alpinus) rare in this country, must be a ‘bloody forriner’; or one of the Peeping Tom Snails (Helix Voyeuristicus).

<|startoftext|>And very few are able to do a #JacobReesMogg and shift their business into the EU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not surprising businesses have not prepared for #Brexit  Many have been paralysed for months because of #Covid19, yet government refuses to extend the execution date, and leaving #EU puts businesses into uncertainty  Unless government has given guidance they don’t know what to do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We live in hope; though with these vandals in power, hope and faith in the power of public exposure is about all we have got.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe the Franco-Dutch group that won the contract to provide post-#Brexit passports made them black instead of dark blue as revenge.  Didn't previously credit the French and Dutch with the quality of irony - respect!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As #JacobReesMogg predicted, it will take 50 years for #Britain to recover from #Brexit. Even if that madness were cancelled tomorrow it will take that long to recover from #BorisJohnson and his toxic #Tory government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There was a time when lying scumbags were barred from being an MP or had to resign as soon as they were found out. Now it's a qualification.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If it were true #BorisJohnson is going to resign it must be because he’s ticked Prime Minister box on his bucket list of personal goals, been in the job long enough to qualify for PM’s pension, and there’s something very nasty going to come out and he doesn’t want to be there<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson is afraid to appoint anyone competent as they would highlight his inadequacies.  A competent #cabinet member would challenge #DominicCummings’ authority and that would never be tolerated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a big question. Is #BorisJohnson ok in his immediate health? Is he ok in his long-tern mental state? Is he ok as Prime Minister?  And so on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heard #RishiSunak on radio say Minister's will make decisions on social distancing not scientists because "Ministers were elected to make decisions".  #DominicCummings wasn't elected by anyone to make decisions yet he has control of the Cabinet and the country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Three years on By now #GrenfellTower should have been removed and a state of the art, safe, environmentally friendly block of social housing being built on site What is there? A tarpaulin clad monument to shame of underfunding and wilful disregard for the needs of ordinary people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump - Trump - Trump - Trump - it’s the sound of fascists marching  That’s where we heard it before<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shows you can fool some of the people all of the time.  On the other hand it shows people know #BorisJohnson was lying before the last election.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Brexit and the s**t stirring  #NigelFarage and his like undertook have revealed what a nasty little country #Britain has become.  Or was it always so it's just Farage et al have legitimised thuggery and hatred.  How we miss the country of openness and honesty we thought we had<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Removing statues is the wrong approach Better to add plaques stating money to fund institutions was generated by slavery etc. Statues will become continuous reminders of the iniquities of slavery  Remove statues the slavery link will fade from public Don’t remove them - USE them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wouldn’t patronise #Starbucks anyway. Their business methods, particularly with regard to tax paid on earnings in the #UK, are despicable and something about their coffee makes you feel queezy.

<|startoftext|>Wasn’t #BorisJohnson aping #Trump when he disbanded the pandemic team before the pandemic hit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No point Teflon-shouldering responsibility for food standards onto the consumer unless products are clearly marked with country of origin and production method  Maybe mark all foods with country of origin and 'meets #EU standards' or 'not to EU standard'  #PennyMorduant - liar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's quite a contest for the most idiotic MP on the #Tory benches but #MarkFrancois is certainly a front-runner.  They probably keep him on in a vain attempt to make #IainDuncanSmith look sane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just throw the real #NigelFarage in the Thames<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you killed 60,000 people at work you'd be jailed for corporate manslaughter.  In #BorisJohnson's case exile would do. Perhaps he could go and work openly for #Trump or #Putin instead of smooching Trump and hiding the #RussiaReport<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We must close down ALL live animal markets of this kind anyway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Better throwing him in Bristol dock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Richard Nixon was a known cheat but Americans voted for him  #Trump is self-confessed sexual abuser, least of his faults, but #US made him #POTUS  Being a proven liar with record for squandering public money was no reason to think #British voters wouldn’t fall for #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Worst this century - you mean worst in history.  Even Eden in the Suez debacle was trying to act in #Britain's best interests; not himself, an elite or to curry favour with the crowd  Unlike #BorisJohnson, Eden had integrity to resign when it was apparent he wasn't up to the job<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe this is #BorisJohnson’s cunning stunt. He’s going to crash out of #EU on worst terms so, when stupidity of #Brexit hits even most zealous xenophobic #Brexiteer, they will be clamouring to re-join  Double whammy, his disaster capitalist chums will have made another fortune<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And we are being governed by someone we did not elect, #DominicCummings, for the benefit of the wealthy, similarly not elected; they just manipulated the election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These predictions of the imminent downfall of tyrannical or populist leaders should always be taken with the proverbial pinch of salt.  #Putin #Trump #Johnson and the like are adept at using power to suppress and coerce, serving powerful backers, and playing the crowd<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The quarantine rules for incoming travellers are symbolic of this shambolic government’s actions - too little, too late.  If these rules had been put in place when lockdown started it would have made sense, un-policeable as they are now, but with some credibility.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is that Filibuster Rees-Mogg?   'Filibuster - an action such as prolonged speaking which obstructs progress in a legislative assembly in a way that does not technically contravene the required procedures'  #JacobReesMogg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An honour for #DominicCummings is inevitable but it will bring the whole honours system into disrepute. Although we've already had Sir Jimmy Saville, Sir Philip Green, Lord Jeffrey Archer, and so on. Being a crook with good connections and plenty of cash is a good way to a title<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Tory Victorian values also include exploiting the poor, slum housing, denying women equality inc the vote, environmental destruction, armed occupation of other countries because they are inferior, privaleged elite, ban on trades unions etc etc  #JacobReesMogg would be orgasmic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So #BorisJohnson is ready to swiftly ease the rules on: Worker's rights Food standards Planning law Environmental protection  Parliamentary procedures Government procurement Politician and public service probity Factual standards in communication and so on and on and on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JacobReesMogg is an offence to ordinary people but gives #BorisJohnson credibility with the landed gentry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Believe it when we see it. Vicious Patel ticks two of #BorisJohnson’s ‘token’ boxes, female and Asian; surely there are more capable and understanding women on the #Tory benches, and an Asian who will not be a traitor to their own immigrant heritage. 1/2.......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The statement would never end<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, for some perverse reason #Labour handed the last election to the #Tories, putting up no effective reason to vote for them.  Seeing the way support collapsed in the Labour heartlands, people must have voted for #BorisJohnson, a known liar, because he wasn’t #JeremyCorbyn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>27% - as much as that! Just shows, you can fool some of the people all of the time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Actually #NigelFarage’s Brexit turned the #UK into a cesspit of racism and division; #BorisJohnson capitalised on the stench.  Nothing Boris has originated himself has turned out well. For example, as London Mayor we had to pay for his vanity bridge plans and the water canon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No ‘if’ about it. #DominicCummings will get a knighthood just as #MichaelGove #JacobReesMogg #PritiPatel etc will get peerages  But Sir Jimmy Saville, Sir Philip Green and the like have set the standard Yet they bar the defender of #Parliament and democracy #Bercow from an honour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Totally over-the-top protection for #BorisJohnson. All he need do is hide in a fridge His mentor #Trump showed how; just ‘inspect’ the bunker while demonstrators are about  #Britain is becoming #America or is this a ploy to show Trump our standards are low enough for a trade deal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And once Sunday trading rules are relaxed and people are used to being able to buy any old tut any time the rules will never be re-applied. Not sure that’s a good or bad thing, there’s only so much money to spend, but with #Brexit burning workers’ rights it could be bad for staff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, corruption, dirty money and outside influences such as Russian cyber activities should do it for #Trump  He knows how to play the mob.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now #UK and #US votes for it.  Sad world, forgetting history means we’re doomed to repeat it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t write appalling #Trump and his tribe off yet  There are 6 times as many white voters than black Bible bashers occupy a large area of #US Trump, like #BorisJohnson, plays on people’s feeling of disadvantage and fears of, for example immigrants Trump knows how to play the mob<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickInEngland @RebetikoWalrus Nope, in fact #BorisJohnson’s defence of his actions has increased the anger, not surprise, just rage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So you’re saying nothing this government says means anything, it’s just something said on the day to make a response.  That’s #BorisJohnson’s and the whole of its government’s style. Can’t be trusted at home and they are turning #Britain into ‘Perfidious Albion’<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DominicCummings doesn’t need to cling on like a limpet, he’s totally fireproof #BorisJohnson will grip tight to him as an alcoholic to a bottle of booze and, like an alcoholic, Boris is in denial about the problem  Cummings is Boris’s life support system so can do no wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Might cause an obstruction with people stopping to ask where they can buy one.  #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andycorneys Yep, and we have adopted the worst of the #USA, not its better qualities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And friends with plenty of cash  You also have to think big If you are shameless and have money you can get away with anything as long as it’s big enough; lies, fraud, killing people Do it small you’re a criminal Do it big you’re a politician (or a banker, property developer etc)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tragic, we lose a man of principle, a doctor we desperately need, and are stuck with a crook that the nation is would be better off without.  #DominicCummings broke the law and got away with it because he is #BorisJohnson’s chum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson sets himself a low standthen fails to achieve it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bet #NigelFarage is spinning in his coffin. He’ll be out when the sun goes down inciting his children of the night to start braying for #Brexit and beating up foreigners.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why? - because #Labour MPs are powerless #Tory MPs are spineless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson may be proud because through his despicable handling of the #coronavirus threat and then crisis he has managed to kill probably 60,000 people, a large number of them reliant on the Social Security budget.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice to think black voters are coming for #Trump.  Problem is #US is 12% Afro-Caribbean and 72% white and alarmed number of those whites approve of Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is #AndreaLeadsom basing this stupid remark on experience of #Tory backbenchers?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most of Parliament, at least the ones who have not been excluded<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JacobReesMogg WANTED everyone back in order to infect them. By infecting all MPs not already shielding they too will have to stay away. All it took was to insist MPs break work from home rule and plant one infectious MP. With all MPs excluded #BorisJohnson has total power<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In #Trump-land he would claim this to be a massive congregation, the biggest congregation ever, a really great congregation. Just as he did for the desultory gathering for his inauguration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pity #Trump didn't read the Bible instead of just using it as a prop in a photo opportunity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump is a disgrace  He was a disgrace before elected but #US voted him in  He's been a disgrace as #POTUS  He appeals to mainly white, disaffected, xenophobic working class and there are plenty of them  As long as he keeps playing on prejudices he's a shoe in for a second term<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wonder what nasty #NigelFarage has to say about this.  Is he rounding up his Brown Shirts?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some hope!  If #DominicCummings, an unelected employee, breaks the rules on multiple fronts but refuses to resign and #BorisJohnson doesn't have the integrity to sack him, #JacobReesMogg is fireproof.  The government and their backers can stride the nation doing as they please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now we see #JacobReesMogg's cunning plan. MPs shielding were denied the ability to participate. Those who attended #Parliament stand a good chance of being infected by #AlokSharma and need to self-isolate for 7-14 days.  #BorisJohnson has achieved dictatorship at last<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohannaSaunders Don't know about giant piss up; by the time #BorisJohnson and his gang are finished we ordinary folk will be lucky if we can afford a round of drinks  However, remembering the day they were kicked out in 1997, it was as if a huge weight had been lifted off the country. Can't wait<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You'll find that when #BorisJohnson is about to lie he makes an intake of breath. Every time he makes an intake of breath it's the prelude too a lie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hasnthappened ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Righty-ho, #NigelFarage, how do you square this one?  You fired the gullible up over immigration; now we are about to suffer #Brexit will you be standing at the airports trying to stop planes from Hong Kong landing?  Must be a photo opportunity in there somewhere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson is supposed to have been in charge since he became Prime Minister. If he hasn't been in charge who has?  Perhaps we know and he wasn't elected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking at this picture, not only is #BorisJohnson wearing an earpiece, evidently being told what to say by someone else, what's wrong with the back of his head? Looks very strange.  Is that where #DominicCummings hits him if he doesn't do as he's told?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After all, what else would attract such a committed deep thinker as Melania to the overweight, balding, hyper right-wing, twice previously married, self-confessed sexual abuser, billionaire #POTUS Donald #Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never thought much about Melania #Trump, just assumed she was a mail order bride, very high level arm candy. Assumed ‘thinking’ wasn’t a requirement.  That is obviously a gross distortion and doing the lady a terrible disservice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson has been hiding away or asleep at the wheel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Try as you might to Teflon yourself out of blame, #BorisJohnson, we all know dire handling of #coronavirus threat was your fault.  You went on TV advocating herd immunity, you were in charge of timing lockdown, you oversaw selective policing including condoning #DominicCummings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now the shock of #DominicCummings’ flouting of lockdown rules has subsided and his dangerous use of driving as an eye testing technique appears to be condoned by government and ignored by the media; it is understood Kwik Fit are going to extend their services to include eye tests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This ‘interview’ or hysterical rant was on Ch4; this obsessive was so fired-up for #Trump he’ll be on #BBC next Actually he wasn’t up to defending the indefensible but swerved questions by complaining about the actions of Democrats  And I thought there was black solidarity in #US<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He asked #DominicCummings to go for him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's an interesting question; if murder is killing with premeditation or deliberate intent and manslaughter is killing without premeditated intent, surely #BorisJohnson is guilty of murder. He knew the consequences of his actions, he knew there would be deaths and went ahead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If we're going to be truly #British in the #JacobReesMogg mould the distance between the MPs should be 4 cubits which would produce a queue of 4 furlongs, given a chain or two.  Ah, all this to look forward to in post-#Brexit #Britain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When #BorisJohnson #DominicCummings advocated ‘herd immunity’ they knew it would cull people in deprived areas, as well as elderly, sick and vulnerable; all people who rely on Social Security system  The apparently dilatory handling of #Corvid19 was about saving money not people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shyman33 @VintiquesMark Either ‘I’m a dickhead’ or #BorisJohnson/#DominicCummings is a c**t<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That gives the #Tories a full six months to find ways of covering #DominicCummings’ arse including discrediting the victim.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He represents the #Tory squirearchy of North East Somerset.  They could put up a scarecrow with blue rosette and the locals would vote it in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Warning on modern life  Yesterday I saw an older woman manoeuvring a large car round a roundabout one handed while talking agitatedly into the mobile phone  She may have taken the car to test her eyesight and was discussing her condition with the optician  https://t.co/n8VTP1hORz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump provides a massive distraction, people horrified at #MattHancock giving out false figures on #Coronavirus, #Brexit rears its ugly head again; nothing much on #DominicCummings.   Looks like he’s got away with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hiding in a fridge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe tide of public disgust at #BorisJohnson's terrible leadership, mendacious government and #DominicCummings' utter contempt for the rest of the country might give them the kick they need  They'll have to make changes or spin like mad to convince people to vote for #Tory again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Compared to so many of the #Tory donors, profiteers and crooks they have awarded peerage and knighthood, #Bercow is a saint.  He's being punished for defending democracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surprised they have enough spine to walk upright.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You bet not. Can't understand why Twitter has gone soft on #DominicCummings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WritersFrock Never in 70 odd years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's rich coming from someone who lolls across the benches during key debates. Does #JacobReesMogg want to return to a denuded #Parliament so he has somewhere to stretch out?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmm.....can we hope the Chief Scientific advisors are having an outbreak of conscience and integrity?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can you imagine Winston Churchill or Margaret Thatcher needing or even tolerating a #DominicCummings?  Churchill wouldn’t have let him near and Thatcher would have had him out on his ear.  What a rubbish government we have under such a shambolic lead-from-the-rear #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Despicable - #Tory revenge on one of #UK’s champions of democracy.  Bet #DominicCummings gets a knighthood or even a peerage, Lord Cummings of Barnard Castle perhaps?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Odd - up to yesterday Twitter was electric with messages about the appalling #DominicCummings.  Expected today, as a working day when politicians should be active to do something, that messages would be Cummings all the way but there are relative few.  Has he got way with it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Speak truth against the government and status, position and income are at risk. That’s the problem facing scientific advisors when they stand up in public; especially if they stand next to a Minister.  It’s the test of integrity, conscience and professionalism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson hasn’t got the bottle to sack #DominicCummings.  He hasn’t got the integrity to speak truth to power and Cummings is the power.  As an addict relies on a drug so Boris is afraid to do without Cummings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The country’s angry enough as it is and trust in #BorisJohnson’s government is a thing of the past.  Putting up #JacobReesMogg to patronise the populous would just be throwing petrol on the flames.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t waste time or brain cells on an argument about this; no point getting into a battle of wits with an unarmed opponent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 This is beyond words! Is #BorisJohnson deluding himself or does he think we’re delusional?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vjl2 Have no fears, this is #Britain; summer officially starts tomorrow, we are bound to have rain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Next step, #Trump will legitimise the Ku Klux Klan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But we’ve all seen one, standing behind a podium outside 10 Downing Street.  We have also spotted another con man sitting at a picnic table in the Downing Street garden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit isn't going to stop illegal immigration, the boats will still be arriving the beaches, it just stops the legal immigrants who we rely on. It's called shooting yourself in the foot. But #NigelFarage will still be pointing at the coastline and stirring up the xenophobes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‘World beating test &amp; trace system’ - World beating at what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Tory sexual morality! Party’s led by man who’s fathered and abandoned at least 7 children, is living with his current mistress and their child in a publicly owned property while his yet-to-be divorced wife is undergoing cancer treatment Tory press slurs- people in glass houses!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, our personal data will be in the hands of a commercial arm of the MoD, and only some of that data will be released to the #NHS, while the full data will be in the hands of the government and their appointed contractor operating JHub.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@derekjames150 Ah, but our ‘real world’ isn’t their ‘real world’.  It’s as if they live on a different elitist, privileged planet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh how we look back to, say about the time of Thatcher, when, though the cabinet etc may have been #Tories and you hated everyone of them, at least they had a spine!  Where are Ken Clarkes, the Heseltines of today? Can you imagine Margaret Thatcher kow-towing to #DominicCummings?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or reduce the demand on the Social Security budget<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this a #DominicCummings distraction? Anything the government says now, good or bad, truth or lie, will be suspected as an attempt at getting attention away from Cummings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The weasel word in #MattHancock’s statement is ‘safely’.  In a situation where we are all at risk, stating that millions of people who have been shielding can now ‘safely go out’ without pointing out the heightened need for social distancing and protection is asking for trouble.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surprised #NigelFarage isn’t standing in front saying all these are illegal immigrants landing on the hallowed English beaches.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Government knew that left unchecked #coronavirus would cull elderly, sick, vulnerable etc, all a charge to the Social Security budget #BorisJohnson’s slow implementation of lockdown, ‘herd immunity’, etc, etc, wasn’t about dithering, policy or science, it was about money<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People have just realised that #BorisJohnson is hollow disgrace of a man kept upright because he has feet of clay. That was obvious under the bluster but he fooled people because, like any confidence trixter, he just told them what they wanted to hear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Antmidd1 5 point plan to deal with #Brexit: 1. Cancel 2. Apologise to #EU 3. Hold enquiry into lies and beneficiaries  4. Prosecute guilty 5. Get back to benefiting from #EU membership  Plus, plan on what to do with billions of pounds saved by not quitting Europe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A senior #Tory politician apparently<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The way this #Tory government behaves makes even the most mild mannered of us extremely bad tempered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And what a lot of 'number 2s' they are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MichaelGove and sex - two words never expected in the same sentence!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The answer is in your question: ‘MOST people are staying at home or observing social distancing’, whereas some people are ‘doing a #Cummings’, ignoring rules because rules are for other people.  And our egregious #Tory government with #UK’s worst PM locked down too late<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Could Peter Gibson MP be a friend of #DominicCummings or just covered by #BorisJohnson's 'it's alright, the rules don't apply to us and I'll cover for you' umbrella protection?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmm.....perhaps, if the #DominicCummings scandal won't go away and #BorisJohnson needs a bigger distraction he'll reintroduce lockdown with harsh policing and blame the scientists<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, the #SundayTimes  #SundayExpress #MailonSunday will all be boosting #BorisJohnson and his inadequacies.  If they're not he really is in trouble; he'd only have the #BBC to peddle his propaganda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Following a huge scandal with Ryanair which would have sunk many companies, the boss shrugged his shoulders and said 'they'll be back because were the cheapest'. #China operates the same. If companies look elsewhere for production they'll lower prices until they get business back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two reasons why #BorisJohnson has eased lockdown rules:  1. People are ignoring the rules so he makes a slacker arrangement into policy - leading from the rear.  2. Easing lockdown with its associated arguments is thrown on the table as a distraction from criminal #Cummings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awarding government contracts without tendering!!  That's an open door to corruption. For example it's the way dumb #ChrisGrayling was hoodwinked into issuing a ferrying contract to a company with no ships  Normal Civil Service regulations require three quotes to buy a cheesecake<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please, please Mr Cummings, save us from all this and just go!  To quote Oliver Cromwell:  'Depart, I say; and let us have done with you. In the name of God, go!'  #DominicCummings #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this a '#Cummings favour' - in breach of the regulations but ok because, associated with #BorisJohnson's government, normal rules on propriety can be ignored<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't write the apalling #Trump off yet. His technique, like #Farage and #Johnson, is to appeal to people who feel neglected, disadvantaged, or threatened, and there are plenty of them. That's how they get people to vote for things that actually disadvantaged themselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've ceased to be shocked at politicians' behaviour which, in better times, would be a resigning matter, now it's a qualification for the job.  If John Profumo were a #Tory MP now he wouldn't have resigned; he'd be hailed as Jack the Lad, the next Prime Minister.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But the posh schools, Eton, Harrow, Westminster etc, won't be going back until September.  Is this another example of the '#Cummings' policy application standard?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, such a national tragedy that whatever #BorisJohnson is doing, no matter how disastrous for the country, is his best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So watch out #BorisJohnson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We can all ignore lockdown rules now, just call it 'doing a #Cummings' or maybe 'Dominicing'.  Given #BorisJohnson's technique of leading from the rear, relaxing of lockdown measures may be to legitimise Cummings' action. He's hoping if everyone can go out they'll forget Cummings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Must be difficult for #BorisJohnson not knowing which of his controllers to obey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Britain is becoming the equivalent of a banana republic, with #BorisJohnson as the head of a corrupt government, doing everything it can to keep itself in power while siphoning off the people's money for the benefit of their chums.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThatTimWalker And freezing their pay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VintiquesMark Hit the nail on the head there  Pity someone doesn't do the same to #BorisJohnson and #,#DominicCummings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's #BorisJohnson's style, leading from the rear.  Wait until you see what people are doing then make it policy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The government may be gagging for positive headlines but #BorisJohnson can make other people (not #Tory MPs or advisors) putting up with hardships sound positive by appealing to patriotism, the last refuge of a scoundrel.  Easing lockdown is about the money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So many people must have said it but bloviator - #BorisJohnson   Thank you @susie_dent, so timely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He’s publicly admitted, suspecting affected eyesight, illegally driving wife and small child on a public road, risking their safety and other road users Apart from confessed breaking of lockdown and driving laws, how does his insurer feel about him driving whilst potential unfit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No matter how you dress it up, #DominicCummings deliberately flouted the rules that the rest of us are living by, got in his car and drove his family so a distant part of the country risking infecting at least his wider family and anyone else he met.  Then....(continued)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why wait?  He threw another member of Downing Street staff out on her ear why can’t #BorisJohnson do the same to #DominicCummings?  Oh, hang on, it’s difficult to throw someone out while they’ve got you by the short and curlies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson blocks question about #DominicCummings; the #BBC takes #EmilyMatlis off air for asking politicians about Cummings. Which bit of Boris Johnson’s anatomy has this unelected Downing Street supremo got a grip on that he can be defended this way?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's the money of course<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Handwriting analysts say the circle over the i indicates someone who is craving attention, not for advertising purposes, as a character defect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Daniel Kawcyznski complaining about #EmilyMatlis doing the very thing that was Jeremy Paxman’s acclaimed technique. One rule for men one for women?

<|startoftext|>As someone older I’m affronted having #MattHancock, this political Boy Scout, telling me my ‘civic duty’ and moral obligations  If I had any thoughts of cavalier behaviour #DominicCummings has blown restraint out of the window  Most of we pensioners know the rules and apply them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson is the blustering mouthpiece for #DominicCummings’ policies. Without Cummings Boris is just bluster. He knows it and is afraid. Cummings knows it and thinks that gives him license to do whatever he wants.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DominicCummings next job will be as #BorisJohnson’s Special Advisor.  He may not be in Downing Street, his salary may be hidden somewhere in the Civil Service budget, he may be called something else, but the Prime Minister will not let him go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s a political scandal based on a public health disaster which has revealed an attitude of arrogance at Cabinet level and the weakness of the man occupying the highest post in the nation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So we can all go on holiday now, call it our #Cummings break  Worried about your eyesight, just drive around endangering other road users, pedestrians and fellow passengers As long as you don't hit anything or get caught your vision is tickety-boo, except you can't see the danger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So it's #DominicCummings above national benefit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But #BorisJohnson will just face it out. He relies on #DominicCummings more than his backbench MPs, he only got one Cummings but nearly 80 surplus MPs. He knows they'll all toe the line eventually.  Urging everyone to 'move on' just translates as 'we can do whatever we like'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hearing on #BBC news that government wants everyone to 'move on' from #DominicCummings' despicable behaviour and focus on other things In other words arrogant sh*t got away with it and we #Tories can do what we like Cummings provided enough distraction #Boris needs something new<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We need to set up a public forum ‘Boris Watch’ or ‘Tory Watch’ to look out for all the harmful legislation they are slipping through while everyone is distracted by #coronavirus. #BorisJohnson’s apparent dithering over #DominicCummings is likely to be some slight of hand<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I understand this right #DominicCummings holds a political appointment but is paid from Civil Service budget, not #Tory party, not #BorisJohnson, but ordinary taxpayers.  In that case he’s accountable to us and has to comply with Civil Service rules of acceptable behaviour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikegalsworthy It only takes a gerrymandered 52% to completely screw a whole nation so there must be some action on 59%.  Having said that, the will of the people in #Scotland and #NIreland was to stay in the #EU and that was ignored.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Complyorcry @BorisJohnson Yes but nobody listened and, with the right-wing media bouying him up and Jeremy Corbyn as the ineffectual alternative, Mr and Mrs Brexiteer and their immigrant hating brood were off to the polling booths to give posh boy #BorisJohnson the job he connived to get.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, Barnard Castle is Lourdes for the optically challenged!  Visit Barnard Castle and throw the white stick away  It had a miraculous effect on #DominicCummings vision though he seems to have trouble seeing the  hypocrisy of his actions and the damage he's doing to the country<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True, but these characteristics are exemplified in #DominicCummings and #BorisJohnson which is why they are the target of such widespread vitriol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hated Margaret Thatcher and, at the time, her cabinet. By comparison with today’s self-serving sh*t shower they look like statesmen and women.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a 600 mile round trip to possibly infect his parents, sister, her family and anyone else he met on the way.  #DominicCummings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now infected #BorisJohnson? He is the chief carrier! He allows #DominicCummings' behaviour to be tolerated and become the norm for a particular elite.  Trouble is the second homers and red neck revellers will say if it's sauce for the goose.......thank you Mr Cummings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's not to discount the #JeremyCorbyn effect in contributing to #Labour's election disaster<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a campaigning technique for the morally corrupt Ignore rules and do what you want. Get result that benefits your cause then turn your back on criticism and if you hold power investigation can be suppressed  That's how we get #Brexit, #Tory election victory, #RussiaReport etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s #BorisJohnson’s plan, talk about something else and ignore the questions about #DominicCummings’ behaviour so it fades away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If highlighting and pursuing #DominincCummings’ appallingly dangerous, entitled &amp; unapologetic behaviour were a #Remainer led movement it would demonstrate that the Remainers are not only right but have the moral high ground<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joepike @VladimirFarage First glance at this tweet looked as if it referred to the year 1820 and was therefore about #JacobReesMogg, his policies and attitude to the poor.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wisheart12 Totally agree. Until #Brexit I believed #UK unity essential. Now, if will of #Scotland or #NIreland people is to remain in  #EU and independence is the price, so be it  #England, people and politicians, leaves you head in hands in despair at the nasty little country we’ve become<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre Beyond anger to despair, for the whole country. The #Cummings debacle is just the exposed tip of the pyramid of corruption, assumed privilege and corruption.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your highness/Prime Minister in charge/Sir.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jenengl @wmarybeard Not as high minded or erudite but we mere mortals might draw the analogy of #BorisJohnson as Nero, fiddling while Rome burns.  Though Nero could have had the fires started deliberately where Johnson is continually fire-fighting through inadequate planning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stupidly #BorisJohnson missed his chance yesterday too. If he’d said #DominicCummings admitted a judgement error and apologised there’d have been a couple of days bad press and the story would have faded Unconditional support shows Boris’s moral weakness and Cummings’ arrogance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Journalist cutting is a technique #BorisJohnson learned from #Trump. He’ll be accusing anyone other than from right-wing media of ‘fake news’ next.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre #BorisJohnson’s statement on ‘parental instinct’ is doubly infuriating; he’s fathered and abandoned at least seven children and refuses to state the true number.  When he leaves Downing Street trophy Carrie Symonds and young Wilf will be at risk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ToniBrisby You’re right, it will be interesting to seethe Civil Service line on his behaviour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ToniBrisby These are the Civil Service terms and conditions:  https://t.co/er2JFKyRE3 Section 4. CONDUCT AND DISCIPLINE is interesting.  Also:  https://t.co/z9DWqAQMWx  #DominicCummings seems above the section: Standards of Behaviour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ToniBrisby The official description is a cover-up No civil servant would be permitted to behave as #DominicCummings does, would be given a wildcard to behave as he likes, be able to run a junior member of staff out of the work place. Civil Service t&amp;cs specify levels of acceptable behaviour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DominicCummings isn't a civil servant. He wasn't recruited in an open Civil Service competition, has not had Civil Service development or appraisal, isn't managed by or responsible to anyone  He's an unelected political appointment at the Prime Minister's whim and we pay for him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson 100% backs his lying hypocrite aide #DominicCummings because Boris Johnson is a lying hypocrite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are people throughout #UK, in fact the World, who have had to be isolated from their suffering loved ones, including elderly parents and children, not been with them when they died, and in some cases not been able to attend funerals. But it's different for #DominicCummings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe #KeirStarmer could 'make #Britain Great again'. The vacuous phrase worked for #BorisJohnson and #Trump.  Starmer would actually mean it and do something for Britain not just a self-serving elite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a newcomer #RishiSunak might well be controllable so he’s the likely one as a replacement PM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #BorisJohnson resigned, unlikely as he has no shame, would his replacement be as under #DominicCummings’ control? Would #MichaelGove, The Slug, become Cummings’ new mouthpiece, or Vicious #PritiPatel be Cummings’ patsy? #JacobReesMogg would consider him too much of an oik<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the front ones!  #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, it’s free for all!  As long as you can convince yourself the second home jolly or family wedding trip to other end of the country is done responsibly; legally, as government advisors do it; with integrity because you don’t approve of other people doing it, load the 4x4 and go<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davemacladd #BorisJohnson is more Lord Haw Haw than Neville Chamberlain.  At least Chamberlain, though inadequate, was working in #Britain’s interest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Neroine? Neroic?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Johnsonian? Need a description of someone who faffs about in a crisis; a word that means ‘like Nero’ - Neorine? Neorillian?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And if #BorisJohnson defends #DominicCummings or endorses his behaviour it is final proof that Cummings is the power behind the Prime Minister and the true controller of government.  Unprincipled, Unelected, unwanted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DominicCummings leaving Downing Street will just be cosmetic; he will still be controlling #BorisJohnson by remote control.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Compared to the people throughout #British history who have been Prime Minister, some of whom were political giants, #BorisJohnson is truly a pigmy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely right.   Note the presentation trained closed fist gesture to try to convey strength instead of the hollow, feet-of-clay liar in a position for which he is neither worthy nor capable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson is between a rock and hard place  If he hides away, hoping #DominicCummings scandal will go away or a bigger distraction can be thrown up to take the heat off, he is shown as a coward If he makes a statement defending the indefensible his true weakness will be clear<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You’re right. If #DominicCummngs, the most powerful figure in government, is sacked there will have to be a by election - oh hang on, no one in the country voted him into his job. He didn’t even have to go through a recruitment process; #BorisJohnson appointed him and we pay him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If being nasty and arrogant were justification for sacking the government benches would be empty.  Quite a result.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@razor_themoan @NeverAmbiguity Don't put money on that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@razor_themoan @NeverAmbiguity More power to him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, #KeirStarmer is behaving correctly. Retain distance and dignity and let the #Tories squirm in the MIRE of their own making<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's believable that #DominicCummings is a friendliness human being.  What is surprising is the neither he nor his well--to-do wife have the wit to get Harrods or Fortnums to drop round emergency rations. Surely #BorisJohnson could have arranged food supplies at public expense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, #KeirStarmer is behaving correctly. Retain distance and dignity and let the #Tories squirm in the mirror of their own making.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just sacking #DominicCummings is naive, he's #BorisJohnson's controller and support system. Expelling him from Downing Street will not stop his influence and Boris will find ways of paying him  The only way of getting rid of Cummings is to flush away the whole #Tory crock of sh*t<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ppryan1 @ChrisDorrell Nope<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Except that, for the rest of the population, caring is restricted by the #coronavirus lockdown.  If you're a #Tory government member or flavoured adviser you are above the law for others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's the wrong way round. #BorisJohnson is #DominicCummings' mouthpiece. Cummings does the firing.  Expecting Johnson to fire Cummings is like asking the monkey to fire the organ grinder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes but it will be #US consumers and farmers!  What nation would be fool enough to put its future trade agreements in the hands of #LynneTruss? - oh, same nation that put handling of the #coronavirus crisis in the hands of #BorisJohnson. Deaths so far 36,000+, so that went well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A ‘source’ says it - what a load of old sauce!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JMPSimor Neither did #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#LauraKuenssberg, the #Tories' publicly funded mouthpiece and #BorisJohnson's sycophant-in-chief<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Resign?? #DominicCummings wasn't elected so considers himself not publically accountable  #BorisJohnson appointed him as crutch-in-chief and would be too scared to operate without him so Cummings feels fireproof.  Official statements will always whitewash him, like Johnson/Arcuri<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre Regrettably the #Tory government's token woman is #PritiPatel.  She was probably chosen as a frightener to keep the cabinet male.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can’t say #PritiPatel is useless, not just useless; malicious, malevolent, mendacious are just some of her characteristics.  Just useless she would be neutral; as it is she takes great pleasure in actively harming the population.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s three #BorisJohnson hidey-holes apart<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre With the second biggest arse in the world in charge (#Trump being the first, of course) where does the half come in?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DominicCummings of course<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the cost of food rocketed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There’s figures such as ‘Ivan the Terrible’ and ‘William the Conquerer’; history will list our current Prime Minister as ‘#Boris the Bonkers’.  Can’t actually call him ‘leader’, when he’s actually around he leads from the rear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RestoreHope_20 Of course it’s politically correct. Hating #BorisJohnson is a given of modern #Britain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And if you can’t afford private heath care suffer and die.  It’s part of the #Tory philosophy- where there’s pain there’s gain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, the Dulux Report gives #BorisJohnson a get-out-of-jail-free card; now there's a surprise.  https://t.co/yq4sSFmNoZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The findings on #BorisJohnson’s relationship with #JenniferArcuri will contain so much whitewash and cover-up it will be known as the ‘Dulux Report’.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Then the government can rub its hands and look forward to a fresh #coronavirus culling of social security dependents, the sick, elderly, vulnerable and so on. No doubt a reduction in the social security budget for the next few years has already been calculated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s self-induced herd immunity. This time #BorisJohnson will be able to grin, shrug and blame people’s own actions  It is a fact of life that average IQ is inversely proportionate to the size of the crowd. So what measures has government put in to police these situations?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YvonneBurdett3 You are certainly not alone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is interesting and could be a lesson for #UK, in time for the second wave. The question is, although there are no deaths in these countries' care homes, how many care homes do they have? Eastern societies are well known for family values and caring for the elderly at home<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmm.. this is interesting. Thought #LindsayHoyle was put in because he is weak and a would let #Tory MPs run riot, unlike #JohnBercow. It appears Mr Speaker has some backbone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's #BorisJohnson's version of #Trump's bleach speech<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Priti awful!  #PritiPatel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, four nations don’t trust #BorisJohnson, not counting territories such as Gibraltar. Who would?  Having said that, #Britain used to be a nation, now it’s four countries with different aims.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe #BorisJohnson, our absentee PM, has been so elusive lately because #KeirStarmer has forced him to spend time taking Prime Minister lessons.  Some management and presentation trainers are trying to kick the blustering sh*t out, teach him to do his job and be accountable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>363 deaths on a good day. That’s nearly three Aberfans (if you’re not old enough look it up and weep; an event that caused national mourning and outrage.  Now the government hails 363 deaths, not counting the 37000+ that preceded them, as a triumph of their dilatory management.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrsAitchBee Bank balance??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimonPease1 Is this some kind of Christmas cracker joke? A #Tory party of course, statement of the obvious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, zero hour contracts mean you don’t get paid when you’re not working. #BorisJohnson has cut himself a deal where he gets paid a large amount of taxpayers’ cash even in his absence and he is more destructive when he works than when he hides.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The next thing will be conscription into a new Land Army.  Those unemployed because of the #coronavirus crisis will be forced to work the land or get no benefits.  The #Brexit wartime analogy have reached reality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed, for the first time I'm embarrassed, no - ashamed, of #Britain and the way our government and most of the media behave. Never thought it would come to this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What do you mean #BorisJohnson has broken pretty much every #Brexit promise? He's ended freedom of movement; though he lets #PritiPatel take the credit/blame. Ending freedom of movement is the only thing that concerned #Brexiteers. All the damage to #Britain is just collateral<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No #Trump no #BorisJohnson no #MichaelGove no #JacobReesMogg  no #NigelFarage no #Brexit - all the country's Christmases at once!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only if they come from #China. So much of what we have now comes from China<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe #Trump is being prescribed hydoxychloroquinine by a doctor who wants him gone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson may resign using ill health (real or not) as the grounds for leaving, as well as wanting to spend less time with his family<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump dreams up his own alternative reality that appeals to his core voters, the disadvantaged, disgruntled, xenophobic, chauvinists, then starts to believe it himself.  At a more calculating level he holds power by telling people what they want to hear rather than reality<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two of the long list of possible side effects of #Hydroxychloroquine are blurred vision and hair loss.  Might explain some of #Trump's strange ideas and personal preferences<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Comment from #BillClinton accurately sums up #Trump #BorisJohnson #MichaelGove #NigelFarage #UKIP #Brexit the #BrexitParty #DailyMail #DailyExpress #TheSun and so on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VintiquesMark F**k business, that's the truth of his thinking. #BorisJohnson's kneejerk thinking on the hoof means he will screw any individual or group that stops him achieving some self-interest goal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VintiquesMark There's certain analogy with #Brexit; they are both stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The level of faith in #BorisJohnson has remained absolutely unmoved since the day he was elected- none whatsoever. Events have proved that belief correct.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As much as that!  Wow, thought #BorisJohnson’s only function was photo opportunities and sound bites.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boris charge, Boris fares and so on. Name the blame where the shame lies.  ‘Blame’, ‘shame’ and ‘lies’, three words that automatically come together when #BorisJohnson is mentioned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cunning stunt by #BorisJohnson’s #Tory government; made cash to keep #TfL running a loan so #Labour #SadiqKhan would be forced to increase fares, congestion and other charges before the mayoral election. We’ve had ‘Boris bikes’ now we should dub these costs the Boris charge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Knowing nothing of #CarrieSymonds, other than as an unmarried mother of a #Tory politician’s latest child, housed at public expense; could #KeirStarmer story be a favour to #BorisJohnson by one of her former lovers for taking her off him?  That may be a slur on a saintly woman<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By donkeys do you mean the cabinet? #Tories<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThatTimWalker Nope!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre Don't worry, the planes will be back soon enough, the low ones wrecking enjoyment of the outdoors<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just shows it is possible to have wealth and a social conscience; unlike the owner of the #DailyMail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@turbograndad65 @acgrayling My feeling exactly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True; but if Mr Toad (#BorisJohnson) goes and we avoid The Slug (#MichaelGove) power grab who is the likely candidate? Vicious Patel, leader of flog ‘em, hang ‘em, send boys up chimneys set? Clean cut but dim #DominicRaab? Not Minister for the Victorian Era #JacobReesMogg surely?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Possibly the most credulous and easily led.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Similarity of #Tory government ineptitude to Crimea extends further than #Brexit. #Coronavirus hospitals were named #Nightingale after the most famous nurse and administrator who went to sort out a situation where troops were dying because of non-existent government provision<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is a man who has realised his own inadequacy; that he blustered and bamboozled his way to a position of power, that his policies and ability are founded on sand and he is basically hollow.

<|startoftext|>Just seen a news headline that #BorisJohnson and Carrie Symonds 'led the clapping for #NHS'.  That totally took the validity out of the demonstration.

<|startoftext|>That’s not right, #ChrisGrayling’s only function in Parliament is to make #BorisJohnson look competent.  Fails at that too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonathan_MBanks @rustymar1 Yes, but you’ve got to go back to the days of rotten boroughs, open voting and purchased seats; when owning property was the qualification for a vote.  Having said that, there is still an underlying principle that with lots of money and paying for good PR you can buy government<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‘We’ maybe testing ‘literally hundreds of thousands of people every day’ but not for #coronavirus. Other medical conditions, eligibility to stay in #UK, for Universal Credit, and so on, andso on, lots of tests.  Wild statements, #BorisJohnson sounds like Sadam Hussein’s PR man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perhaps #COVID19 removes the capacity for serial lying by blocking the thought process; resulting in incoherent random statements and non sequiturs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So far I have been convinced that #BorisJohnson’s supposed bout of #coronavirus was a PR stunt to make him appear an heroic victim rather than an incompetent politician.  However, talking gibberish may be a residual effect of the virus.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So now we are going to stop supporting people by keeping their jobs going we are going to pay for them as unemployed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed, pity about the #BBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Try putting the virus on Universal Credit. Nothing can live on that.  #BorisJohnson #Tories #coronavirus #UniversalCredit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which is a dead cat to distract from #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>75 years recovering from bankruptcy caused by WW2 40+ years peace and prosperity as part of #EU plus ensured rights and standards  Thrown away by a credulous disgruntled mob voting for #Brexit even though they would be worse off and many old enough to remember bad old days pre-EU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perhaps we could export this rabble to #Trump-land. They'd be so at home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cancel #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson is not insane.  He's cunning, conniving and corrupt; which he could get away with if he were not inadequate, self-serving and the puppet of far darker powers that operate behind him as the mop-haired, blustering, say-whatever-the-crowd-wants-to-hear front man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heard insightful point on #BBC #WomanHour. All countries being vilified for abysmal handling of #coronavirus crisis, including #UK and #US, are led by men. Countries being praised for efficient and effective handling of the situation are led by women including #NZ and #Germany<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And in future massive budget cuts and taxes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson and his government listened to science they wanted to hear and ignored or ridiculed scientists who told them to act and #lockdown. If science didn't fit the political will it was censored Now we are paying for this stupidity; deaths, illness, jobs, economy and so on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MiriamMargolyes hits the nail on the head and has a name for #BorisJohnson - Blowjob.  Toujours le mot juste<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s one of the problems with #BorisJohnson, the screwed-up mess we are in is the best he can do.  #Briain deserves better, no matter which party is in power, the nation needs statesmen and women leading it, not an inadequate shower as we have now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it correct passengers arriving by air to #UK will be required to self quarantine? Only by air? Apart from being late, if correct, the weasel word is ‘self’. How is this going to be policed?  Any open space has locals flouting #Covid_19 rules; no chance of controlling incomers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The plan will be to wait until the crisis is over and there's a grand total to spin and minimise.  '60,000 dead, weeell it's only as many civilian deaths in WW2. We (you) have got to take it on the chin, Dunkirk spirit, blather, blather, blather.'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a matter of timing. If #BorisJohnson declares an act of national mourning and sheds crocodile tears at 30,000, he'll have to do it again at 40,000, then at each horrific number thereafter. Even his most blinkered supporters might start to lay blame.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And within the Nazi occupied territories there were many incredibly brave resistance fighters putting their lives directly at risk to defeat the Nazis, even within Germany.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, #FionaBruce, does this mean you are endorsing the government’s statement?  #BBCQT #BBC #Tories<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a downright lie by the #DailyMail (no surprise there).  #KierStarmer asked the photographers if they had finished as he needed to help his daughter who was trying to cross the road opposite. Even the photographer he as talking to confirmed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnandi No, you’re not alone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imagine Churchill standing to try to explain to soldiers on the front line that they haven’t got protective equipment or weapons, despite he and his government knowing three years in advance what reserves were essential in case war broke out, but they didn’t order them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s more than just 24 hours; there’s a whole reporting philosophy and level of integrity, even between two right-wing newspapers -if the #DailyMail can be considered a newspaper.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As his cavalier and incompetent handling of the #coronavirus crisis led directly to vastly more people dying than would have if he had acted properly at the right time, does #BorisJohnson qualify as #Britain’s greatest serial killer?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No PR opportunities at home and he would have to share responsibilities for his latest offspring.  #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Having been late and incompetent at protecting the country from #coronavirus, #BorisJohnson wants to be ahead in some thing, so he is lifting the #lockdown and exposing the herd to infection early.  He is switching from 'too little, too late' to 'too much, too soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Simple technique, set a target which sounds like a big number but the resources and logistics to achieve it aren’t there, then people supposed to be delivering can be blamed.  Manipulation masquerading as action covered by bluster.  Bloviating #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‘Johnson pandemic’ is the correct name but these days everything needs a catchy handle  Johnsonovirus? - Bit of a mouthful Borisovirus perhaps? Boris-19? Borvid-19? Boris plague? Or #BorisJohnson’s controller could have the honour: Cummings plague There must be something snappier<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, #BorisJohnson is not a ‘man of the people’ and there is some doubt over whether he actually had #COVIDー19.  As a lifelong liar anything he does is suspect, including getting his own coffee; is this a photo opportunity or is he thirsty?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Relaxing the lockdown is defaulting to herd immunity.  #BorisJohnson #coronavirus #Corvid19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Went to local branch of QVS electrical wholesalers today; repeat ELECTRICAL wholesalers. On the counter were paper face masks, sold singly at considerably more than pre #coronavirus prices, and 100ml bottles of hand sanitizer for approximately £5.60 each. Cash in where you can!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And public spaces are not being policed any more<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, if there's something in it for him, even as a distraction. He's gambling our lives to maintain his popularity   #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#USA #Britain #Russia #China #NorthKorea and so on and so on, it seems corruption is taking over the World.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, VE Day wasn't celebrated; previous anniversaries were noted, not used as an excuse for street parties by people who weren't there at the time But previous anniversaries didn't have #Brexit, the national disaster destroying benefits &amp; freedoms those who faught the war achieved<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeftWingAlways Target practice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s a #Tory party tactic. It was evident with #TheresaMay, #DavidCameron and #MargaretThatcher. Rather than answer awkward questions they attack the style or integrity of the questioner and in Parliament are followed by a burst of braying from the Tory MP rabble.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can understand why some people in other countries pick up a gun. #MichaelGove #BorisJohnson #NigelFarage #JacobReesMogg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If only there had been a credible opposition<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I loathed Cameron until he resigned over #Brexit. When the populus was hoodwinked into voting #Leave he said ‘not in my name’ and quit so the country could chose a leader to implement its intention. That the chosen one was #BorisJohnson shows the stupidity of the decision.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surely the #Tory benches can provide someone, man or woman, with more credibility and ability than #NadineDorries?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NadineDorries appointed Minister of State for Health Ronald McDonald appointed Minister of State for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Nothing this government does surprises any more It’s a sad state where Nadine Dorries is the best talent #Tory party can provide. Token woman?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Culling the social security budget<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson, #DominicCummings #MichaelGove and the rest of this appalling government followed the science they wanted to hear. There was plenty of advice shouting lockdown and experience of other countries would have told a responsible government to take action hard and fast.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Having the highest death rate in Europe is #BorisJohnson’s version of ‘making #Britain Great Again’<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh Lord, #BorisJohnson is now trying to portray himself as some kind of wounded soldier. He would say of #Coronavirus that ‘we will fight them on the beaches’ if #NigelFarage wasn’t already doing that against immigrants<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wisheart12 It was programmed culling of Social Security dependents, including pensioners, as they are the most vulnerable to #coronavirus Unfortunately for #BorisJohnson and #DomincCummings the virus is less controllable than #Tory financial constraint<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrewLawDesign Dire Straits or in this government’s case ‘straights’<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cynical manipulative bastard.  #MichaelGove<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our manipulative government have even shifted the May Bank Holiday so people can indulge in this anti-Europe jingo-fest. And May Day is a traditional celebration of workers' rights  Ironically #Brexit destroys principles of freedom our forebears fought for that resulted in VE Day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The VE Day 'celebration' is a cynical  hijacking of history as a metaphor for #Brexit.  Don't recall a similar shindig on the 60th, 65th or 70th adversaries. Just a note on the TV News.  You can bet the appalling #NigelFarage will ooze out of the woodwork waving a Union Jack<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Poles72 @OpenUniversity Absolutely not. I finished a Masters aged 60 and on a degree course one of the students was 70 and that was in the first year. Students go on into their 90’s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Odd how #BorisJohnson recovered so quickly and apparently without need of rehabilitation   #coronavirus #NHS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScotlandshireGB @mikegalsworthy @BorisJohnson Not quite right, #BorisJohnson ascended to heaven and told everyone he is God.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But you can see #BorisJohnson, and no doubt other #Tory ministers, using photo opportunities of them clapping in support of the #NHS in appreciation of its achievements, despite attack from our own government.  Never seen a picture of #DominicCummings applauding the NHS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#LizTruss will probably achieve a mega deal to import US cheese.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VintiquesMark Quinoa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And #BorisJohnson's herd immunity would cull so many from social security dependants Triple whammy: govnmt spends zero, social security budget shrunk, #NHS overwhelmed and softened for privatisation. Government can claim natural causes  #DominicCummings must have been orgasmic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wordamentalist Me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe #BorisJohnson's precautionary treatment was actually an overdue vasectomy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHACHIECOCO It was in the papers, radio and TV, the Office for National Statistics identified #coronavirus hits poorer areas more than affluent ones If you are in a lower income area where houses are closer together, people more crowded, you are at higher risk  #NHS has nothing to do with it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How lucky for the #Tory heartlands that the doctors looking after #BorisJohnson were not called Raj and Davinder.  Nothing wrong with the names but it’s a pity young Wilf has to become part of his father’s PR programme.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Until Boris returned and could take the credit. Boris going into hospital was a convenient distraction from the blame for the government's incompetence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just look at circumstances, read reports, e.g. '#BorisJohnson has been taken to intensive care as a precautionary measure', look at the timeline for people who have genuinely contracted #coronavirus; note 'build up Boris' remarks by cabinet members and how decisions were delayed-<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson didn't nearly die. He was taken into intensive care as a precaution and if he had #coronavirus seriously, or at all, he wouldn't have recovered so quickly or thoroughly  There's a whiff of PR here. Notice how many decisions were held back for his miraculous recovery<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not only are #Tories switching funding from neediest areas as promised to get their votes, #coronavirus hits poorer areas more than more affluent.  Who would have believed a virus would thrive in places where people are more crowded, some are homeless and living standards are low<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Young Wilfred is going to Eton; peculiar names go unnoticed there. Look at what #JacobReesMogg's brood have to put up with.  #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can see the businesses sign already - 'Wilf Johnson, Rag, Bone and Scrap Metal Dealer. Own horse and cart, will collect'  As the poor lad's mother isn't married to his father it could be 'Wilf Symonds'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No doubt #BorisJohnson and #NigelFarage will claim the #coronavirus total of shame as a triumph for #Britain as it something where it out-does Europe.  Never mind the quality hear the numbers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The irony being, unless you have been serially abused by Native Americans, all those who told you to go back to your own country are from immigrant stock #Trump’s paternal origin is Germany, his mother was Scottish. Of his three wives, one was Czech one Yugoslav; not #US citizens<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Truth manipulators such as #BorisJohnson #NigelFarage and #Trump succeed by telling lies a gullible mass of people want to hear; the only difference is that Trump appears to believe his own lies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Problem is they tell those who feel disaffected and disadvantaged what they want to hear; so whatever they say is accepted, no matter how blatant the lie.  #BorisJohnson and his cronies are masters of the technique of spinning failure and incompetence into claimed success.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh yes! ‘Ipsedixitism’ the principle that drives so much media and politics in twenty first century Britain.  It’s what got #NigelFarage and #Trump what they wanted for a start. #BorisJohnson too, remember the slogan on a bus, just one example.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‘British’, a mongrel nationality, an amalgam of Celtic/Saxon/Roman/Viking/French/European and so on; at what point does the blood become pure British? Does @SusanHarris80 claim unpolluted descendancy from indigenous Neanderthals? The ideas certainly haven’t progressed past tribal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even #JacobReesMogg is occasionally seen with one of his brood.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can bet the rest of #BorisJohnson’s wife and children feel pretty hacked-off that their absent father has created another step- brother and he is getting all the attention.  With all the photo opportunities Boris craves he is never seen with his children.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paullewismoney I have always been a champion of the #BBC until the news department became the publicly funded #Tory propaganda unit.  The rest is still the best, apart from the drive to make every popular entertainment programme a competition<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would we notice the difference?  #BorisJohnson doesn't need to feel stressed; he just does what #DominicCummings tells him.  Dominic Cummings, #Britain's unelected, unaccountable national manipulator<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RachelAldred @UniWestminster Congratulations. You'll be on the TV next<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Covid Symonds-Johnson?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #Tory MPs are all celebrating and expecting us to be distracted by the arrival of young Winston Symonds-Johnson.  #BorisJohnson #Brexit #Coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wonder how the sanctimonious serial reproducer #JacobReesMogg views #BorisJohnson fathering a child to an unmarried mother?  If it were someone living in social housing rather than No10, a different kind of state owner property, he and his like would be highly disapproving<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is no stigma in being born illegitimate these days, it seems to have become the norm, and #BorisJohnson has now made it approved practice. Will the parents put their new addition to Boris’s maintenance list down for Eton as Baby Symonds-Johnson?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre #BorisJohnson didn't 'flirt' with herd immunity, it was definite #Tory government policy. It was the least cost option; required the government to do nothing; would stretch the #NHS to breaking point and cull the old, sick and needy, all relying on the social security system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, we need a new leader, one with the qualities of Churchill, not pretending to be him.  #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hear! Hear! Though what we hoped has been a newly invigorated #opposition with the appointment of #KierStarmer has still been pretty muted Come on #Labour MPs, start holding this abysmal government to account before they spin their failure and negligence into some form of triumph<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Banning specific TV and news journalists from government briefings to avoid awkward questions or unflattering reports is more than just Orwellian or Machiavellian- it’s Trumpian!  Never thought a #British government could so low.  #BorisJohnson #Tories #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the government have tried blame-shifting the abysmal testing level onto #NHS workers claiming they have not been attending<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For a government obsessed with spending as little on public services as possible, investing in PPE at the right time would have been more cost-effective than compensating families of dead #NHS workers  Oh - and those workers would be alive and their families would not be bereaved<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And it’s a certainty Mr Whippy doesn’t disinfect everything each time he stops the van and hands out a cone and the AA do not have vehicles where the two front seats are two metres or more apart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What price lockdown? Yesterday we had the ice cream van, chimes full volume, not only getting people with their children out of their houses but pulling up beside families out for exercise  Today we have the AA driving school; not an essential service or an essential journey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson is back in Downing Street on Monday - as if things weren’t bad enough already!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scientific advisory groups, as other specialist advice providers, are there to provide evidence to government; not have their opinions filtered and spin through one obsessive, non-elected, Prime Minister’s favourite, unaccountable to public and politicians  #DominicCummings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At first glance this picture appears to be #Trump clones being treated in hospital; then you realise the colouring is too natural to be Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With #PritiPatel’s track record it can only be assumed reports of an attempt to smuggle cocaine with PPE is laying the ground to undermine PPE suppliers or somehow blame #NHS.  If the reports are true then it is another example of dealers using any route they can to get drugs in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Explains #Trump’s colour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaitreDeBallet Might be worth paying good money to see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In circumstances like this the ‘cult leader’ should lead by example and publicly drink the stuff.  The current #US leader may see himself as a latter day Jim Jones who got 900 of his followers to drink cyanide in 1978.  #Trump ‘cult leader’ only one letter out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And how much will #Dyson be paid because we do not need his ventilator?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How times have changed! In the days when #BorisJohnson was being sacked for lying (now it's considered a qualification) British children were raising money through  #BBC Blue Peter to send aid to third world countries.  Now #Brexit #Britain is the third world country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As #Trump is #BorisJohnson’s role model and he follows Trump closely, can we look forward to Boris injecting himself with Dettol?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‘We are following the science’ is not true. #BorisJohnson and the gang followed the science they wanted to hear - the cheapest option, the one that would allow a rogue virus to cull the vulnerable from the social security system.  They IGNORED the science that screamed lockdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We need evidence that #Dyson will not receive any taxpayers’ money for respirators or anything else not delivered; and certainly not for anything designed on the strength of a wink and handshake from some pal in government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump will be re-elected because he plays on the prejudices of the disaffected and disadvantaged and there are enough of them to keep him in power. For example, he claims poor economic performance in industrial areas and many other ills are due to immigrants; handy scapegoats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson and his government chose to ignore the scientists who advised immediate lockdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who pays for #DominicCummings?  He: -controls government but was not elected -works for government but is not a Civil Servant -was appointed without any recruitment process -rules No10 like a despot #BorisJohnson appointed him but taxpayers seem to fund him without accountability<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump, like Harpic - clean round the bend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@francesbarber13 Why did this farmer specialise in lesbian pigs?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So relevant when #Trump and some of our own politicians speak.  #Tories #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Weren’t injections with unsuitable chemicals one of the techniques used in Nazi concentration camps?  #Trump is either genuinely unhinged or pursuing a policy of self-culling the terminally stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is just #Tory blame shifting  Scientific evidence is one factor responsible #government takes into account; it is an element with, e.g. experience of other countries, intelligence gathered, public confidence.  Scientific evidence is information - not an excuse for inaction<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump’s policies are limitlessly stupid and he has basest intellect and taste but he survives on low cunning and knowing how to appeal to disaffected voters He works on fears and prejudices, eg against immigrants, he gets voters to endorse policies that actually hurt themselves<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That’s gold plated corruption! #Trump #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Andrew_Adonis I worked in Whitehall in 1997; the day Labour was elected it felt as if a huge weight had been lifted from the country, and things really did get better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson, #DominicCummings and gang saw #coronavirus as a gift to capitalists. It would cull social security dependants: pensioners/sick/vulnerable and so on They could cut budgets, shrug shoulders and claim natural causes It backfired and we’re paying for deliberate neglect<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With this government's handling of the #coronavirus emergency, even though they knew what needed to be done from #ExerciseCygnus and actions of other countries, a pre-paid funeral could be a good investment. #BorisJohnson and co put #Brexit above lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why not? The taxpayers funded the exercise why are we not allowed to see the results. This is information censorship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson employs a basic bad manager technique: To make yourself look top dog surround yourself with the incompetent and yes-men and women. If any of your team look as if they are going to shine blame them for something and get rid.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JeremyVineOn5 It would be great except #TonyBlair  would have to work with a totally hostile cabinet keen to stab him in the back and blame him for their shortcomings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‘Austerity’ has lost all public credibility but, though they they will dress it up as something else, the government will claw back all the money handed out to deal with #coronavirus and it will be the ordinary people paying for it.

<|startoftext|>@db_webb Could be quite a queue.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PolhomeEditor No doubt #DominicCummings did not like it<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Absolutely, #DominicRaab has the most poisonous hyper right-wing beliefs; he competes with #PritiPatel for sheer nastiness, but he is put up because he’s the #Tory poster boy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where there’s pain there’s gain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pay #NHS workers properly, give them the correct protection at work and an assured future. Dolling out gongs across the whole NHS would be a cheap substitute for true regard and devalue the medal. NHS staff are heroic, what about care home workers, home care workers, and so on?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have no fear, we, the ordinary people will pay for it while the government founders make millions, more like billions, at our expense.  #Tories #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where is the economic analysis of #Brexit, in the same locked drawer as the #RussiaReport?  Withholding this information is data censorship. It is not a matter of national security it is political manipulation  We taxpayers funded the studies and we are entitled to the results<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If this proves effective it can only be hoped #BorisJohnson and his government do not miss placing an order or refuse to accept because they are 'developing a home grown version': Fujifilm's COVID-19 drug enters testing in US; will be free to 20 countries   https://t.co/sHplbeKJ7Y<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@virgosam70 Congratulations! Blocked by those people - such an accolade<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TammRehgallag There isn't one, and it's led by the worst Prime Minister ever. Even Anthony Eden had better motivation than #BorisJohnson and Eden's support team didn't try to create a cult around him to cover his inadequacies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, it's one rule for the privileged and one for the rest of us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How appropriate, the hospitals are named 'Nightingale' after a heroic nurse who went to the Crimea to sort out a #British government-made mess caused by bravado, inadequate planning and lack of proper provision.  And so history repeats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We live in hope.  There’s always the chance even political low life such as #BorisJohnson may see the light. No doubt there is a biblical analogy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SangusUK No doubt you’re right. Unfortunately, with the current state of #British politics and the right-wing media portraying incompetence as planning, such stories are credible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently, doctors who refused to be bound by the Official Secrets Act when #BorisJohnson was admitted to hospital are sayinghe wasn’t suffering from #coronavirus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pity #JacobReesMogg has risen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had this scam too. Looks totally genuine; fortunately I realised it was the wrong time of year but beware<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‘Kick the #Tories out’<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh Lord! I thought #Britain had scraped the bottom of the barrel with #BorisJohnson but this:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does it matter whether #NHS staff who died contracted #coronavirus through their work or not? Just raising the question is an admission that they were not adequately protected<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chancellor’s #coronavirus cash bonanza is needed but was put in place quickly to cover dilatory government action that made it necessary  As ever, big business and businessmen with deep resources receive millions of taxpayers’ money regardless of need, and we won’t get it back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Focusing on #BorisJohnson’s health (that’s ‘Butcher Boris) shows #Tory sycophants’ values and serves as a distraction from the deaths. One irresponsible politician receives precautionary treatment and recovers while thousands died, families bereaved, many through his incompetence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@richard51185877 Makes us so angry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VintiquesMark Me too. And Question Time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Herd immunity would have been a gift to #Tory government Treasury would have contributed nothing  Most vulnerable would have died; that could be blamed on #NHS  Majority of deaths would have been in population needing social security support, elderly, disabled etc. What a saving!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheSun’s headline ‘#Boris is out!’ - has The Sun been the first to declare #BorisJohnston gay?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tend to watch #BBC out of habit but switch to #Channel4, even #ITV, for the truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We all need a rest from #Boris<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surviver smug and more-suffering-than-thou  #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Who’s team?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DominicRaab doles out big thank-yous to #NHS workers, carers and the other key workers  And when this is over he and his chums will get back to cutting wages, privatising state owned providers, reducing workers’ rights, diminishing health and safety, and expelling immigrants<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre Seem to be more people each time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anthony73286866 The death figures quoted are for #coronavirus in addition to the people who would have died from natural causes. A variation of 3 in a population of 60 million is ‘statistically insignificant’<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anthony73286866 #DominicCummings was appointed by #BorisJohnson for advice and paid at public expense. His recorded pronouncements include proposing herd immunity and allowing vulnerable to be sacrificed. If he’s going to be quoted as a policy maker he cannot be excused when it all goes belly-up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anthony73286866 #BorisJohnson is Prime Minister, he can demand technical information from whatever sources he chooses and can compare information. Even if he didn’t want to listen to experts, just paying attention to what was happening in the world should have alerted him to the need for action<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NadineDorries just doesn’t get it. In Europe we would have had access to supplies of ready to deliver ventilators etc. Reverting to pre-war little #Britain we are in backs-to-the-wall, making do and mending, protective equipment out of old socks mode.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And publish the #RussiaReport with it.  At least the RussiaReport exists, except that we the taxpayers who funded it aren’t allowed to see it; unlike the government’s exit strategy which, as far as we know, is a myth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If only #BorisJohnson would listen to the right people at the right time  https://t.co/ydyNhnwscn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anthony73286866 If #Boris and gang had acted when they should with measures necessary UK would have been better prepared Implementation would have been better controlled and impact on businesses less drastic  Fewer people would have died or suffered  We paid price of Boris listening to Cummings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wrong again, only paper I read is the Times. Don’t think that classes as left-wing, a bit left of Daily Mail, Daily Express, Daily Telegraph and The Sun, but only a fag paper’s width to the left Boris was on TV explaining how herd immunity would work. Hitler analogy appropriate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anthony73286866 Even if UK government was ignorant until January they acted too late. People have died, the economy has been hit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anthony73286866 You mean there was a key cabinet planning exercise and Boris did not attend!  There was knowledge of the problem in China from November, it isn’t possible for a whole territory to be affected without diplomatic and security services picking it up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@francesbarber13 I feared Sing Something Simple because it was dreadful schmaltz that made Black and White Minstrels sound cutting-edge.  Sunday radio had a programme called 'If You Think You've Got Problems' which was radio transmitted depression. Sundays were awful and there was school next day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It couldn't be Vicious Patel by any chance? No doubt the response to staff needs is 'Bah Humbug'  #PritiPatel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely. What looks like #Tory government financial cover for the crisis they made worse by bad planning is just budget cuts waiting to happen  #BorisJohnson’s #Corvid19 bailout will mutate into austerity on steroids Of course it won’t touch those making millions out of it now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre There’s always been snobbery about South East London. “Oh, just don’t go there dah-ling”  Surprising when the places that used to be beyond the pale are now so trendy you can’t even think about moving there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahBell85 Don’t know about recipes but cut the leaf parts off the stems, chop the stems and start them cooking first. They are significantly tougher than the leaf parts. Trying to cook them all together is what puts people off kale.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anthony73286866 The economy has been hit far more than it would have been if UK had been better prepared<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anthony73286866 His abysmal lack of leadership turned a major problem into a national crisis. When UK could have been ahead of the World we have the worst death rate in Europe.  There have been hundreds of deaths that could have been avoided. NHS workers have been put at risk, some have died.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anthony73286866 He faffed-about through February into March and proposed laissez-faire herd immunity inaction which would knowingly killed-off much of population  He was advised what needed to be done at national and individual level and still managed to get infected causing problems all round<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Anthony73286866 Boris and gang undertook a planning exercise three years ago to identify what is needed in the event of a pandemic. They knew what resources #NHS needed but they wouldn’t spend the money. First indication of pandemic started in November but was ignored. Refused action in January<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Tory liars #Tory liars #Tory liars   https://t.co/JtzRrEqB8T<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson is paying the price for his own flippant attitude towards #coronavirus and doing too little to late.  Boris will recover, so many people have died because of his and his government’s refusal to make provision, support #NHS, and implement necessary control measures<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Receiving many tweets from people who have lost family and friends to #coronavirus  Apart from tragedy and sorrow of their loss it is deeply upsetting to know that if #BorisJohnson had done what needed to be done when it should have been done the outcome could have been different<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #BorisJohnson is in intensive care he is occupying one bed, whether his condition justifies it or not, but, because he is Prime Minister he will surrounded with security which means reducing the available bed around him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timolarch Having her claws sharpened!  #PritiPatel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And men warned of problems to come and the means of dealing with them shouldn’t bluster-on thinking that bravado will get them through  #BorisJohnson was in prime position for knowledge of pandemic to come and how to deal with it at national and personal levels yet he did nothing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@A_D62 Only where Nadine Dorries lives apparently<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And then you woke up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They excluded the absentee votes and banked on #coronavirus keeping voters away from the polls<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Conservative majority in Wisconsin #USA just approved one of the most brazen acts of voter suppression in modern times. Excluded absentee votes to ensure #coronavirus kept voters away from polls  https://t.co/pk2fK05wpK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And you can guarantee they are #Brexiteers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Given his political plans, clapping for #BorisJohnston is an outright insult to the #NHS and all the admirable workers, frontline and support. As a human being it must be hoped he recovers, thanks to the NHS staff he’s proposed privatising, then he can be held to account<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wonder how many ‘piccannies’ are looking after you now #BorisJohnson?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson is in intensive care for his health. #MichaelGove is in isolation as a benefit to the nation - regardless of #coronavirus. Long may he stay there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FenCoul @DeborahMeaden @sw19 Whatever you use to clean the windows (crumpled newspaper is the traditional ‘cloth’ and works very well) make strokes left to right on one side and up and down on the other. Then if you can see any streaks you know which side to polish them off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where’s the trusted information? This statement includes The Sun, Daily Mail, Daily Express, Daily Telegraph so the plea to buy them because of their integrity is as hollow as the values of the papers themselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump been shoplifting again?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is that because the #NHS is under-provided with ventilators?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes #NHS is amazing, one of #Britain's great achievements.  Aren't you glad you and your cronies hadn't got to privatise it before you had to admit its worth and it saved so many of us. If you'd privatised NHS we'd be pouring #British taxpayers' cash into #US health companies now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Adolf Hitler, Pol Pot, Idi Amin, Joseph Stalin, Oswald Mosley and so on, all fellow human beings in their way Just because lying, philandering, self-serving #BorisJohnson happens to be of same species as, for example, #NHS staff saving his hide, doesn't excuse him of anything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre Will #BorisJohnson claim to be running the government from the  intensive care ward?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YvonneBurdett3 #Farage doesn't need to be cautioned by the police - he needs locking-up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Graz_Jakomini It may have had blades with straight or shaped cutting edges to cut square or decorative grooves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Graz_Jakomini The blade is missing but it is for cutting a groove or similar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre It could because the details get changed in translation. The English report said '#BorisJohnson is a pumped-up windbag' which translated to 'Boris Johnson is being given oxygen'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson thinks he’s running the government but that’s just delirium produced by the infection and isolation  #DominicRaab is now the frontman and hasn’t consulted Boris for two days which indicates he’s been sidelined  And we know unelected #DominicCummings calls the shots<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That would be the #Covid_19 miracle!  Worst Prime Minister in history, #BorisJohnson, gets infected with #coronavirus through carelessness and procrastination, then emerges with a conscience, national interest, and qualities of a statesman.  The scenario for a credible rom-com<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Having already shown positfor #coronavirus #BorisJohnson is being tested for the presence of conscience, humanity and honesty  Not sure if the available technology can detect microscopic traces.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Were the sunbathers at least 2 metres from each other and other people? If so, there is the problem?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boris heaps praise on the #NHS, the core public asset he was determined to wreck and sell-off.  His words emphasise how essential the NHS is to our lives, the commitment of the staff and former staff returning to work, and the value the public places on it. Cynical opportunism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just received my really expensive, not welcome letter from #BorisJohnson It says- ‘from the start we have sought to put in the right measures’ - no you didn’t! An outright lie You knew 3 years previously what would be needed from a planning exercise and wouldn’t spend the money<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And take #DominicCummings with him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just heard #BorisJohnson may be occupying an #NHS hospital bed. Bet he's glad he hasn't succeeded in selling it off yet. Hope he's not there to size the place up for privatisation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry for anyone suffering from #Coronavirus including #BorisJohnson Notice he is being taken in for tests rather than because he needs hospitalization. Presumably somewhere private, not the Nightingale Trying not to be so cynical as to see this as a distraction from #KeirStarmer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someone in parliament must propose passing law to tax profiteering in all forms. It won’t get anywhere though because the party in government is funded by profiteers.  #Tories<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vs_youth So you’ll vote Tory instead?? Or try to create a Labour Party in permanent opposition, as in Corbyn wilderness years, or join a more extreme minority party that just shouts from the sidelines. No argument with JC’s ideals and sincerity but being earnest in opposition does no good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vs_youth What Blair knew, and hopefully so does Keir Starmer, high ideals and motives need to drive what you do but without power they are just aspirations. Johnson and Trump proved that you can get the top job with the lowest standards, it is what you do with the power that counts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vs_youth Thatcher years were time of self-interest and set structure for worst of what we have now, eg selling off public assets to Tory supporters Labour victory in 1997 felt like a huge weight being lifted from the country, history will judge Blair more kindly that today’s mudslingers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly, ensure correct application of social distancing and exercising rules, not house arrest Confining people will just foment a domestic form of road rage - ‘house rage’, ‘flat rage’ or the greater form: ‘one room bed-sit rage’. Maybe topped-off with dose of domestic violence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One strand of protein (#coronavirus) can damage the economy for decades #JacobReesMogg forecast it will take 50 years for #UK economy to recover from #Brexit  We are totally damned if both these disasters are forced on #Britain, Brexit is the one piece of self-harm we can avoid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The rest of the #Tory party have probably realised #BorisJohnson presents their interests best in solitary confinement. He could be banged-up for some time.  #Boris’s broadcasts from the bunker certainly have a stir-crazy element.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just as millionaire #BorisJohnson appears to be #Tory party leader backed up by, for example, millionaire Chancellor #RishiSunak, and the multi-millionaire #JacobReesMogg.  Encouraging to see that, like #KeirStarmer, it is possible to be a millionaire and have a social conscience<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Taking exercise in an open space with distance between people is a benefit. The key is in ‘open space’; being enclosed in a tube train or bus, maybe even stuck indoors, there’s a high risk zone. Gathering in groups or laying static sunbathing are wrong; not exercising in the park<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How many of those have been cooped-up with families in flats, possibly tower blocks, and how many were behaving responsibly and keeping 2 metres away from others in a large open space?  Police incorrect and foolhardy behaviour but denying access to open spaces completely is wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't smile about the demise of #Brexit yet. Dracula kept rising from the dead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If they had acted at the right time the hospital might not have been necessary, certainly not the urgency.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NightingaleHospital wasn't built in two weeks, a large, existing empty space has been fitted out by #NHS knowledge and Army know-how.  Nothing to do with #BorisJohnson and his government other than they finally got their administrative arse in gear and released the cash.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two people have told me they have been run-into by joggers who seem to think that because they exercise they have divine right of way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just make sure the #Labour front bench have fire in their bellies as well as high ideals  It was infuriating to see #JeremyCorbyn put a cutting question only to be rebuffed with personal abuse rather than an answer and unable to stand up and challenge - and that was just from May<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The core message - '#COVIDー19 shows how unfit they are to govern'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fingers crossed  #KeirStarmer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There was no effective opposition before GE2019. #Tories were given a free hand aided by partisan media  We need a firebrand #Labour leader; I believe #KeirStarmer is best choice but he seems so polite. The front bench needs an old-time political bruiser to knockout #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Government didn’t build Nightingale Hospital. #BorisJohnson finally got his finger out/arse in gear, (pick your euphemism) and let the #NHS and Army get on, organise the job and do it.  There is no credit to government; this is firefighting because of procrastination<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Experience has shown when it looks as if #Trump has dragged the #US to rock bottom he can create more levels of degradation without a trace of conscience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The government had more than 3 months to prepare. They undertook a planning exercise in 2016 on what was needed in the event of a pandemic. They knew what the #NHS needed but refused to spend the money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@francesbarber13 True, Oxo is no substitute for beef consomé<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And we get contradictory messages.  We see #NHS workers and people in the street and shops using conventional surgical masks but the experts say they don't work.  Nations where they commonly used have lower infection rate. What's the truth?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If it was anyone other than #Trump hijacking goods would be called piracy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Luckily the Germans are not vindictive enough to tell post-#Brexit #Britain to go and get the swabs analysed on the World market as we abandoned #EU.  Someone saving #BorisJohnson and his gang's collective arses again. If only they'd put planning and investment before profit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A lot of #Tory brass have gone to ground. With party performance a national scandal and worst Prime Minister in history #PritiPatel #JacobReesMogg #DavidDavis #LuamFox and the like are kept buried. (Eden was a terrible PM but he had #British interests at heart, not self-interest)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrewLawDesign 10, that's MINUS 10<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somebody has pointed out to #BorisJohnson that fruit of the Magic Money Tree is needed for more vital use and it’s not there to fund his personal aggrandisement.  The tree grows on taxes taken from ordinary people and we object to having our cash returned as expensive waste paper<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is the government using #coronavirus as an opportunity to get on with some #Brexit dirty work without scrutiny?  The most untrustworthy administration in #British history is bound to be up to something. Refusal to extend the transition period sounds a major alarm bell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NHS staff being asked to fight a nuclear war with bows and arrows.  #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wonderful - only unreal part is the #NHS hero (heroine) has a face mask. The wrong face mask but a face mask.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For #BorisJohnson to make or imply any comparison with #Churchill or any other worthy statesman is highly offensive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson's only characteristic in common with #Churchill is being determined self-publicists.  Churchill was not perfect but spoke sense (most of the time) and was THE man in a crisis.  Boris babbles nonsense and collapses in a crisis. He is opposite in every characteristic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They've got #BorisJohnson   where they want him. Could be the longest isolation in medical history.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson has only two skills - self-promotion and abusing a position of power to benefit his pals.  That abuse includes selling off national assets and destroying the economic and social future of the nation. Risking the breakup of #Britain is just collateral damage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bad Mad Nad  #NadineDorries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@molecularcont Something strictly to be guarded against. #Coronavirus has highlighted not only the value of the #NHS but how it is vastly better than an insurance funded system and the damage done by years of #Tory underfunding as a preparation for privatisation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Clap him in irons.  #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wherever government gets the kit now, one thing's for sure, someone will make a fortune buying and selling surplus hospital equipment once this crisis is over. This government won't have foresight to put them in store and will give a wink to their chums that a good deal is about<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How many firms will decide they can manage with fewer staff when #coronavirus lockdown is over?  Hopefully there will be a surge of demand as soon as people can act normally again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First reaction is to say 'no', you need regard for others to adopt even mild socialism.  However, as #coronavirus underlined the value of the #NHS and government support in crisis times, self-interest may produce a change of heart.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@VintiquesMark China<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We’re doomed! British #government has reached rock bottom.  #JacobReesMogg has been suspiciously quiet lately. Maybe he’s self-isolating from the 21st century. No change there then.  #LizTruss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A #Tory Minister who will tell the truth? Isn’t that the textbook example of an oxymoron?  With all the government wriggling, blame shifting and denial they think we are all morons.  If only there were an effective opposition to hold them to account<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson and the gang performing the old trick: 1. Stating what needs to be done,  2. Glossing-over that it is #government’s responsibility to do it,  3. Trying to look as if it is someone else’s fault.  Worthy of Sir Humphrey Appleby   #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But ‘race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot’ and ‘shameful heathen’ is the #POTUS #America seems to like.  You left out ‘sexual predator’ and could throw in ‘ill-informed, deluded, vainglorious chauvinist’.   Maybe the long words wouldn’t suit the core #Trump voters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saw distressing broadcast of lunatic Prime Minister in isolation as convincing as a bulletin from Hitler cornered in his bunker as the Reich crumbles around him.

<|startoftext|>Yes, closing garden centres is counterproductive. They operate same as supermarkets and can be managed the same. That will save multimillion pound supply chain from collapse and prevent taxpayer being hit with another compensation cost  It will also help mental wellbeing for some<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The government is throwing out any excuse for their appalling performance. The ‘lack of chemicals’ lie is on par with ‘the dog ate my homework’.  As the cabinet members went Eton or similar; it would be ‘the dog ate my prep’<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davemacladd We should rename this lockdown ‘the waistline challenge’.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A glittering example of #BorisJohnson’s crimes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahBell85 That’s great but the flower growers are going bust with a massive perishable stock that will have to be thrown away<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Michael63268804 Looking at the plants shown on tv as going to be a waste it doesn’t appear they are ideal for home delivery and they need to be shifted in volume. Home delivery seems a simple solution but the garden centres don’t appear to be pushing it so there must be a problem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not suggesting a free-for all. Access and contact has to be managed. If Tesco can do it no doubt garden centres can<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The centres are mostly out of town but this might be considered as a manageable need. Not only would it save the growers and sellers it would help the sanity of some of those stuck at home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Garden centres are closed when they have millions of pounds of perishable stock and people with gardens are stuck at home. Whole industry at risk.  Perhaps if garden centres could be opened on same managed basis as supermarkets the industry can be saved without public expense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@francesbarber13 @bethvaughan15 Yes, it was years later. She spent the war entertaining and travelling to raise support for Britain. Gutter press ran a hate campaign against her on the pretext she'd run away. It led to Churchill making statement in Parliament to stop it.  Not surprising she went to live abroad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timjn1 That’s really offensive. Perhaps you could use it for some form of target practice<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Not have a government like #BorisJohnson and the #Tories<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Take lead from Germany where testing has limited #coronavirus, minimised deaths and got much nearer to a return to normal quickly.

<|startoftext|>What is tragic for #Britain is that what #BorisJohnson is doing is ‘his best’<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not surprising #Labour is nowhere to be seen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe sharing fake news should be an offence anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God help us!  #Brexit #MichaelGove<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, it’s the same as #Trump associating himself with the good work that other people do. Notice the way he says ‘we’ did something when he is reporting good news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cockalorum - #DonaldTrump  Is there historic expression for oozing self-important individual -#BorisJohnson? Or creepy arrogant individual - #MichaelGove? Or a bombastic self-important failure - #IainDuncanSmith?  Historic language must have rich words for all #Tory front runners<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ashworth101 Only his resignation   #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#IainDuncanSmith says: ‘We must stop kow-towing to these despots’ - presumably he means the government must stop placating #Tory party funders at the expense of the nation.  #TimMartin #Dyson #Murdoch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Instead of clapping we should all stand outside and BOO #BorisJohnson. Incompetent, untrustworthy, survives by constant fire-fighting instead of planning and investment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be glad you weren’t waiting for #BorisJohnson’s chum #Dyson to cobble a ventilator together for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No it won't be scrutinised; #BorisJohnson has suspended #Parliament and the government is oblivious to media criticism.  Despite any dirt uncovered now, if the #Tory party were in trouble they know most of the media would protect them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, the government is manipulating the figures on #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson’s government finally got down to some foreword planning. If they’d done better planning sooner they might not be looking for burial spaces and you can bet the government won’t be paying for the funerals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@francesbarber13 Well, by the law of averages or something, even the appalling Daily Mail can be half right sometimes and you are not ‘deranged’<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s 90,000 volunteers to do the work those #EU workers used to do but Brits can’t be persuaded to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidschneider #BorisJohnson is carrying on regardless of circumstances and his ability to function as Prime Minister while sick. Evidently does not think #DominicRaab is up to the job or is worried he will show Boris up as the bumbling self-promoter that he is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s his style.  #MichaelGove<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Over #Brexit and the last election #LauraKuenssberg was so far ‘up’ #BorisJohnson and the #Tories it would not be surprising if she disappeared during the period of the PM’s isolation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson is either desperate to hang on to top job and won’t let a deputy take over, even though his head is muzzy with #coronavirus, or he just doesn’t trust anyone else in Cabinet to be up to the job  He could be afraid whoever acts as Prime Minister might be better at it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@francesbarber13 I’d rather see #DominicCummings failing to run away from an angry mob. Never thought I’d advocate violence but this government brings out the worst in people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Should the slogan: ‘#BorisJohnson killed your nan’ actually be ‘#DominicCummings killed your nan’?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In #UK #Tories spent 10 years undermining #NHS to soften it up to sell to their chums They hit #BBC by shifting cost of older people’s license fees making it easier for #Tory funders to bite at In #US #Trump’s hit on National Parks smacks of move to privatise a national treasure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True, it appears even the #BBC has regained a spine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@derekjames150 Well, Eden was pretty disastrous, and there have been others but you have to go a long way back. #BorisJohnson is certainly a front runner<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We can assume this apalling woman is not over 70 and does not have a pre-existing condition.  Headline for the #DailyTelegraph: '#BorisJohnson killed your Nan and #AllisonPearson is glad about it'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s basic technique of massaging statistics by changing basis of recording Make the #coronavirus figures look better - change the need to record deaths Improve employment figures- change the basis of recording so any schoolchild with a part-time Saturday job counts as in work<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@francesbarber13 You weren’t the fool in this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is #Dyson’s payback for promoting #Brexix<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe #Dyson will attach a mouthpiece to one of his ridiculously priced ‘oh I’ve got nothing better to spend my money on’ hairdryers and call it a ventilator. No doubt the #NHS will be charged double for the label.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, this is what we look to the #BBC for, cutting edge political analysis. Although, BBC was sycophantic to the #Tories over #Brexit and it got them nowhere. Could it be #BBCNews see #BorisJohnson and his gang as a wounded animal and they don't want to be associated with them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, but #Aldi is an #Germany based company showing the #EU spirit.  Compare their ethics with, for example, #TimMartin's #Wetherspoons<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A few minutes light entertainment in troubled times. Heath Robinson lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redpeter99 Just say all copies of the #DailyMail and similar have been sold as lavatory paper and the shelves were empty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You mean someone lit a fire under him and he has got his Leader of the Opposition backside in gear? As with everything #JeremyCorbyn has done, too little, too late<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Labour under #JeremyCorbyn was totally ineffective. Now it seems to have disappeared. The #Tories have been running rings around Labour for years, now they have a completely free hand and #Parliament is being suspended to put the cherry on their cake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DominicCummings has achieved full control of #Britain at last. Pretty soon he won’t even need puppet #BorisJohnson to make the announcements for him.  Just realised, Boris’s hair is about the same colour as Sooty; at least we know whose hand is up Boris   https://t.co/ozGwmDXxe7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #SelfishSociety has always been with us but Thatcher legitimised it, even made it national policy and a way of life, that’s why society is so fragile.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even if quarter of workforce have to travel and TfL can only run quarter of services they will be as crowded If govt cannot support people to stay home the only answer is stagger working hours/days  Qualifying for any govt benefit will sort out anyone been working cash-in-hand<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People are not going to work from choice; they’re going because they’re essential to maintain services or because their employers will not release them to stay home, ie employers consider their profits essential Or they’re in work where if they don’t go no pay, nothing to live on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Wetherspoons we’re already on the on the lifetime ban list with #Dyson over #Brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you giving a prize?  #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But when the #coronavirus emergency is over it will be back to cuts and privatisation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now the people who could not receive a pay rise, who had to keep society running with fewer and fewer resources, at all levels from cleaners and drivers to top doctors, the police etc, etc, who were excluded from ‘the magic money tree’ are realised to be essential workers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeborahMeaden #TimMartin gives #Ratner the appearance of relative integrity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As #BorisJohnson favours catch phrases my next door neighbour, sensible, educated, professional young woman with two children, suggested one to remember his handling of #coronavirus:  'Boris Johnson killed your nan'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SemperTyrannis Not the explanation given by from friends in Cornwall or the picture painted of the Cornish fishing operation by Rick Stein on the radio.  However, you may be right and making the situation now worse by dwelling on the past may be the answer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hear! Hear! No point insisting people stay home unless employers say they can. The ones paying wages control the number of people on streets and public transport.  Cutting trains, underground services and buses is lunacy. It just squeezes those who have to travel closer together<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes you wonder if ‘language’ is #Trump’s first language<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@damocrat ‘Dislike’ - you’re so polite   #MichealGove<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fishing was a flagship policy for the #Brexit obsessed Cornish despite the fact that they already sold their fishing quotas to large corporations and the county as a whole received at least 10% more from the #EU than it contributed. Brexit- a triumph of slogans over sense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Until it hits them, then they will complain about lack of control and inadequate medical services.  Same with #Brexit, they won’t care until the consequences hit them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‘Absolutely necessary’ is a matter of context - eg out in your car for an urgent legitimate reason something punctures a tyre or two. At that point a tyre depot is absolutely necessary We should start at absolutely UNnecessary - hairdressers, nail bars, tanning parlours and so up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VintiquesMark Because #BorisJohnson is just a hollow front<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre @suesustainable Food waste, what's food waste?  Not in this household<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Same stupid sentiment expressed by Michael Caine over #Brexit.  This gammon mentality was prepared to sink #Britain economically now it's happy to kill off people directly plus all the damage #coronavirus is doing to society<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You don’t think the appalling #MichaelGove would be divisive?  It could be that #BorisJohnson doesn’t think Gove is up to the job. Or maybe Gove is less lively to follow #DominicCummings’ instructions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To adapt a wartime slogan:  'Careless walk costs lives'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And you can buy paracetamol?  Add a couple of packs to the trolley with the toilet rolls, pasta, rice, milk, eggs, fresh fruit, vegetables, meat and fish etc. All items completely stripped from four supermarkets visited on Thursday and still being grabbed. Oh, and asprin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least the Greeks do not have an equivalent of #DominicCummings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Evidently their brains are smaller than the #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IF #BorisJohnson becomes ill!! His behaviour has never been that of a sane person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson and his top advisers could be taken ill during the crisis.  Come on #coronavirus! The one thing you can do to compensate #Britain, in fact the World, for all the damage and disaster you've caused.  Take out #Trump #Farage #ReesMogg and so on, you owe us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If it's being officially denied it must be true.  #DominicCummings #BorisJohnson  #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is #BorisJohnson's role model; on the other hand it shows how little faith his father has in Boris's core policy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now we know what #BorisJohnson meant when he said "fuck business".  We all thought he was just playing to the crowd over #Brexit but his total lack of commitment, even to the group that fund his party, is now evident<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As an 'expendable' pensioner I'd be happy to 'expend' #DominicCummings myself; do the deed as an act of national benefit.  If he is expelled from Downing Street he will still be controlling #BorisJohnson remotely.  This schmuck rules #Britain without being elected or accountable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like father like son<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DominicCummings rules #Britain despite not being elected or open to scrutiny.  He operates through his mouthpiece and puppet #BorisJohnson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DominicCummings must take full share of responsibility for the situation #UK is in, not just #coronavirus, that’s just shown up how destructive #Tory policies have been on #Britain.  #BorisJohnson must go too for his share of the ruin and without Cummings he is rudderless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TimMartin is a greedy idiotic bastard; no either/or.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While #BorisJohnson is isolating and, like the rest of us, using the time to do tasks that keep getting pushed aside, it’s a grand opportunity to publish the #RussiaReport.  It’s bound to be on his computer. All he has to do is attach it to an appropriate email and press ‘Send’<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson can be the new Guy Fawkes, along with #NigelFarage #JacobReesMogg #IainDuncanSmith and so on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@francesbarber13 Not at all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No bankers either<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit voters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some people think that because they are a pal of the #PrimeMinister they are above the law. Send in the police to close #Witherspoons and throw #TimMartin in jail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You may have noticed #EU  countries were quicker to bring in measures to deal with #coronavirus emergency and are better at dealing with it than #BorisJohnson's government. Restrictions applying in normal times are bypassed.  Oh, and we had #Brexit inflicted on us a while ago<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JacobReesMogg predicted it will take 50 years for #Britain to recover from #Brexit. Now the economy is in free-fall what is the new recovery date - a century? #Brexiteers - why do you insist on us doing this to ourselves?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #Brexit special!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And when lies become the normal currency of communication even the liars forget which information is the truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like everything else, the selfish suit themselves and grab everything they can and, because they can afford inflated prices, are happy for the more needy to suffer  Crises such as #coronavirus show up the inadequacy of our political leaders and basic self interest of so many<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They can have their own media service run by #RupertMurdoch #PiersMorgan #JuliaHartleyBrewer etc. They can call it the ‘Fox Daily Telegraph/Express-Mail and Sun’<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson should be exiled back to Mustique and perpetually quarantined there along with #DominicCummings #NigelFarage #JacobReesMogg #AnnWiddecombe #IainDuncanSmith #MichaelGove and all the other #Brexiteer shitshower. They can have sovereignty over their own island.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson’s style - too little, too late.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another #BorisJohnson vacuous catch phrase. One of his specialties<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SwerianBot @BorisJohnson For lies read liar, but then with #BorisJohnson that goes without saying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SwerianBot @BorisJohnson Just think, when he gazes into Carrie Symonds’ eyes, as with his wife, and vows eternal love she knows he’s a scheming lies. Unless, of course, she has her own agenda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SwerianBot @BorisJohnson Not sure if #BorisJohnson and the #Brexiteer gangs’s whopping lie about £350 million per week with taking back control counts as the second biggest. Surely this must be one of, if not the greatest, of his deliberate falsehoods.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An interesting example of how quickly nature takes over.  Catalonia has boars in its towns; we have to suffer bores spouting nonsense about #coronavirus starting with #Farage #Widdecombe #TimMartin #DuncanSmith.  Then there’s the government’s truth-averse frontman #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely right. Waitrose, Sainsbury’s, Tesco and Morrison’s all decimated by lunchtime. Pictures show fresh meat and fish, fruit and veg (Sainsbury’s), milk and toilet roll aisles (Waitrose)  https://t.co/DDXjdUgErx<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>How about commandeering those obscenely large cruise ships and mooring one or two of them in #London and other large port cities?  Plenty of comfortable accommodation, easy to police access, easy to deep clean, easy to return to normal use after the #coronavirus crisis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson is trying to channel Churchill but he doesn't have the gravitas. Just a fuzzy Mickey Mouse carbon copy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Utter stupidity. #Labour leadership contest has been ridiculously drawn-out already. All the while there is no effective opposition and #BorisJohnson and his gang are not held to account.  Don't delay the contest get on with it! This pfaffing about has become the Labour hallmark<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That won't happen. One way or another all of #BorisJohnson and the #Tories' funders are profiting from the crisis. It will be the small businesses and ordinary workers who suffer<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Full agree on the ‘no confidence in this government’ but hold off any kind of vote until there’s an effective opposition in place; otherwise the same bunch of crooks and charlatans will be put in government again.  #BorisJohnson #Tories<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very sensible- only hope the closures and service changes, with those that will inevitably follow, will not be used as a pretext never to re-open or restore them.  This government is bound to have its own Dr Beeching waiting to come out of the woodwork.  #TfL #London<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The tragedy of the incompetent way planning to deal with #coronavirus has been handled, as well as other government business, is that #BorisJohnson’s cabinet is ‘doing its best’.  It’s the #ChrisGrayling standard of achievement.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If businesses collapse now the workers will become an immediate social security burden and there will be a massive loss of tax revenue.

This is just staggering business collapses as they go under in future carrying the need to pay off government loans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can’t agree on #JeremyCorbyn’s leadership and vision, otherwise he would have won the last election.

<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre If alcohol-based hand cleanser is beneficial in protecting the hands against coronavirus would a stiff drink protect the inside? Could an alcoholic haze make long periods of self isolation tolerable?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Panic buying becomes an obsession. Even though panickers cannot move at home for toilet rolls, pasta, hand cleanser etc , etc, as soon as there is stock on the shelves they grab everything they can. They get to the shops early and other people's needs get no consideration<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No chance, the capacity to lie is now  a qualification for for a government post. It's all about sincerity; once you can fake that you can walk into #BorisJohnson's government and sit at the feet of the master.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson and his gang refused to bail out FlyBe because 'government is not there to support failing businesses' (unless it's a bank) There's no reason to give #RichardBranson a penny of public money.

<|startoftext|>That's it! The impractical prospect of isolating all over 70's is just a ruse. It's a way of suspending the #HouseofLords and avoiding scrutiny of the government. It also avoids #BorisJohnson being accused of using #coronavirus as a way of culling the expensive older population<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are public school included in plans for possible closures due to coronavirus? If parents have paid squillions of pounds to Eton, Harrow etc, will they get a refund?  Will the pupils who come to #UK just for schooling be shipped home or confined in UK.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>‘Herd immunity’ - #DominicCummings- speak<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You can tell when #Trump is telling lies - his lips are moving<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VintiquesMark Dead right   (Though I though Rabid Zealots was the name of the new Chancellor)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would #Trump think the same if we had a #Labour government; even if a Labour government were doing a better job?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I believe #Trump's dictat is that no one who has been to a proscribed country within the last two weeks can transit through #UK to #US including Brits.  That means anyone from an at risk country can come to UK for a while and US travellers can come and take a souvener virus home<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>'Herd' is an appropriate description of the #Tory government's attitude to the mass of people. Herds get slaughtered or milked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PritiPatel, the one instance where better the devil you know might be relevant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a distraction; like the garden bridge when #BorisJohnson was London Mayor.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Why was there no money for #NHS but it can be flooded now? What areas of social funding will be hit so money can be flung at coronavirus?

<|startoftext|>TonyBlair got into power by stealing the #Tories’ clothes. Rishi Sunak as done the same trick by delivering a #Labour budget. However, the budget is big on promises and scant on detail. How will the big infrastructure projects be sustainabley funded?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Didn’t #Trump pull the same stunt early in his presidency; a question raised over his health then a pronouncement that he was super fit?

<|startoftext|>@JustSayNope Regrettably human nature doesn't change and the British have got used to freedom, selfish or not.  We live in a country where people hoard and steal hand sanitizer from hospitals. Honouring a curfew wouldn't occur to them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does the folder change colour because the #Tory government has delivered a #Labour budget?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustSayNope So you'd declare martial law and have soldiers shooting people if they left their homes? People going stir-crazy at home are bound to go out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Waitrose this morning, tissue shelves the same, apparently delivery of hand sanitizer went in seconds.

<|startoftext|>We need an analysis of whether children are at greater risk where they can associate with a wide range of possibly infected people and behaviour or together in a controlled environment with increased hygiene  But if mass isolation the answer we’d better get on with it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What you say may be true but China is a different society, totalitarian and far more controlled We’re living where people steal hand wash bottles from hospitals. Expecting all parents to stay home and keep children isolated for possibly weeks will take great deal of implementing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doubt if #ChrisGrayling knows where #Russia is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustSayNope Social isolation would potentially save lives. If it were a matter of closing schools for a couple of days it would help. People will not keep fit and lively children locked away at home for weeks. Parents who have to work may resort to childminders, a less controlled environment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustSayNope It’s a matter of assessing where the children are at greater risk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustSayNope I’ve had children and am involved with a school. All you say is true but it doesn’t just happen in schools Yes, the government must provide; if advice is to close schools then financial provision must be made. If they are kept open  additional hygiene provision has to be made<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustSayNope When that advice arrives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustSayNope If it has to be done it has to be done and promptly. But schools, for example, are controlled environments where cleanliness and behaviour can be monitored. Children dispersed may be exposed to wider opportunities for infection.  Happy to follow the Chief Medical Officer’s advice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustSayNope Money at a national level is not the problem, it’s how forcing people to stay home with no provision because they are not actually sick will put families in deep trouble. It’s difficult. Closing things prematurely may have unintended consequences. cont...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Closing schools may become necessary but doing so prematurely means many parents who work while children are in school will have to stay home. As they are not sick they may not be paid or claim benefits. The employers will lose staff; the children will be behind with school work.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Free parking at hospitals is another #BorisJohnson delusion. It's not that he's lying; when his official car takes him to a hospital he doesn't have to pay so he assumes its the same for all of us.  Just as......<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The apparent #BBC bias is worrying but they know #CarolynLucas will be put on the rack where accusations against #BorisJohnson will somehow fade away or just disappear, like the #RussiaReport.  All the more reason to keep investigating Boris needs to be kept in the headlines<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Have any of the right-wing papers actually tried to blame coronavirus on immigrants, people with non-white skin,  Muslims, the unemployed, the homeless, any other minority groups? If not it will come. Blaming coronavirus on the #EU is a given.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And, of course, coronavirus distracts from the Russia report and all the other information the government is hiding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Coronavirus is a great distraction from #PritiPatel, #Brexit, #NHS, #ClimateChange, etc, etc.  For #BorisJohnson it is the equivalent of throwing a massive dead cat on the table.

<|startoftext|>Imports from the #US, #China, the Far East, #Australia and so on may be cheaper at the point of production but they have to be shipped thousands of miles at great cost and environmental damage.  The #EU is next door<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jobs aren't the only problem. When imports are restricted or subject to extra duty, prices rise; everything from food upwards  There are no plans to supplement pensions and benefits to cope with increases in essentials. Working families will be hit  Don't plan on buying a new car<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Obama told #UK it would be at the back of the trade deal queue. #Brexiteers pooh-poohed the forecast on the basis that Obama used English phraseology, so even the thickest #Leaver would understand, rather than American.  Now arch anti-European #Trump is ramming the message home<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And #LizTruss is planning to open 10 new ones in the #UK.  Is this another distraction, one of #BorisJohnson's 'dead cats'; an act of utter stupidity, it was announced by Liz Truss after all; or a deliberate facilitation for organized crime?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And what the heck is a 'freeport'? Does this mean the #UK will be open house to all and sundry?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because the #UK government is oozing up to the #US and we are now too weak to impose a fine and actually impose it  If the #Tories can plan to decriminalize non-payment of #BBC licence payment #Trump can do the same for #Apple manipulation. It's the world we've let happen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As toadying to #BorisJohnson over #Brexit and the election did not protect the #BBC from being attacked by the #Tories maybe it is returning to its former role of honest journalism.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Typical of the level the #Tory cabinet has reached; delusions of statesmanship.  Unlikely Nicky Morgan insists those close to her use the full title when addressing her; she would be happy with a regal ‘Ma-am’<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The fear for democracy and welfare of the majority of #Britain is that #Brexiteer politicians who have done this stupid thing DO understand the harm they’ve done.  Even the unspeakable #JacobReesMogg admitted it will take 50 years to recover from leaving #EU - if we ever recover<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A long time dead. #UK will not recover from #Brexit in my lifetime.  When the current gang of #Brexiteer politicians drop off the twig hopefully younger and wiser people will get the #UK back into #EU<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is history repeating itself but the #British do not learn from it.  #NigelFarage is the Oswald Mosley of our times; whipping up prejudice and hatred sugar coated as patriotism.

<|startoftext|>#MichaelGove has had his hair cut and appears to have bought contact lenses to look less weird but, polish it as much as you like,  a turd is just a turd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would like to agree but the people in power who lied to get the #UK to commit #Brexit will use their position to block the argument to re-join the #EU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Depends how you look at it. #BorisJohnson delivered #Brexit to his #Tory backers plus #Putin and #Trump  He delivered #Tories an election based on lies and pie-in-the-sky promises which are beginning to fall apart already  He hasn’t delivered anything that will benefit #Britain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And #Putin’s action kick-started a tidal wave of refugees which flooded and destabilised Europe. #Brexit is a symptom of that fear of immigration. Putin must be rolling round the floor laughing<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You shouldn't fall into the trap of judging people by their looks, an ugly person may have a beautiful nature; but in #AnnWiddecombe's case, someone who looks like a demented old loon is a demented old loon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BBC running scared because of government control of the licence fee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does this mean this government #Brexit mole will be in place until September?  #SarahSands<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chlorinated chicken is just one thing; the #NHS will be a major target<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The rise of the right, including #NigelFarage and #BorisJohnson, undermining of parliamentary process and the legislature, whipping up hate and fake nationalism, etc, etc; so reminiscent of 1930’s Germany  So obvious it is as if the rise of the Nazis is being used as a model<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As long as #NigelFarage #BorisJohnson #JacobReesMogg #MichaelGove #AaronBanks #AnnWiddecombe and their followers and supporters leave the #UK it will be enough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even if #Dyson products weren’t over-priced and pretentious I will not buy because of Dyson’s support for #Brexit.  Will not drink in #Witherspoon’s for the same reason.  Always aspired to a Jaguar until I saw arch-#Brexiteer #JacobReesMogg drives one - tainted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No doubt #BorisJohnson will reward #SarahSands with a damehood for services to #Brexit and #Tory and Brexit Parties - at public expense  As one of people responsible for undermining #BBC as the standard of impartial news broadcasting she has contributed to #Tories’ attack on BBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From 1st Feb those dumb nostalgics who voted #Brexit to return to a mythical time of Empire, and when immigrants were just dark skinned people enticed over to man the buses and be abused, will be saying: “remember the good old days of prosperity and freedom when we were in #EU”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or the #BBC  is running scared of and toadying to a gang of hard nosed middle-class #Conservatives who are gunning to get the national public service closed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another bite out of #democracy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this is just the beginning.  Toxic #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Smart motorways, a dumb approach to the infrastructure.  At best it's a novel idea without the necessary resources to implement. At worst it's lethal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Take care; the new members could be #Tories and other right-wingers joining #Labour so they can influence selection of a new leader. They can skew the vote enough to put another ineffectual no hoper at the head.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson in his drive to ‘get #Brexit done’ will sacrifice anything. The man who said “fuck business” and is prepared to let any #UK industry die, for example motor manufacturing, will not give a damn for the fishing industry in the Brexit bonfire of #Britain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally, better late than never, #Brexit on a toilet roll. ‘Brexit’ on every sheet with the face of leading #Brexiteers with a sheet each.

<|startoftext|>Voting for #Brexit doesn't make you stupid; it's the other way round.  Being reactionary, anti-immigrant, politically short sighted, ill-informed, resentful, easily swayed, etc, etc makes you a soft target for the snake oil salesmen to get your votes for their advantage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All the rats in one bag!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre #BorisJohnson will always deny his part in the UK's destruction. It will be a blame game and the trick will be to spin the nation's downfall on #Remainers<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>All the #Brexit 50p coins will be unwanted. I will refuse to accept them if given as change. Not so much legal tender as offensive tender.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre That's understating the situation.  SNAFU (situation normal, all f**cked up) has become the norm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because the #BBCC is running scared of the #BorisJohnson government and most of the mainstream media is owned by #Tory backers.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Prof Joad writing in 1930's on government - nothing changes: Government was in the hands of a small privileged class which legislated in ways to perpetuate the anomalies on which it throve; concessions, the least possible, deliberately made as a guarantee of their continual power<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And so begins the regression of #Britain into the new post-#Brexit Dickensian age. It will be sending little boys up chimneys, if we still had chimneys. No doubt there'll be plenty of jobs where 'hundreds of thousands of businesses' can exploit desperate people with no protection<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes #JeremyCorbyn guaranteed a #Tory government for at least 5 years, which will destroy #Britain's social structure, and ensured #Brexit which will undermine the whole country for generations.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Holocaust deniers, #Brexiteers, Moon landing deniers, anti-vaccine believers and so on - a reflection of the stupidity we have come to.

<|startoftext|>@stroppiest @ParisDaguerre That's why #BorisJohnson's government will not let the Scots have a say in their own future<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre Unfortunately #BorisJohnson operates the #Trump system. He has Teflon shoulders; accountability slides off him, denial is second nature and lying is basic communication. Northern Ireland won't bring Boris down, though he deserves it; he will blame others and just carry on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre Me too - though the 'coming to terms with our imminent departure from the #EU' is doubtful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JacobReesMogg says it will take 50 years to reap the benefits of #Brexit- it’s even worse than we thought; previously he said it would take 40 years!  That assumes there are any benefits and the people receiving them are not just the rich.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any statement that includes ‘could’, ‘assessing’ or any expression meaning it’s not definite in regard to #BorisJohnson #VoteLeave #Tory misconduct or any bent politics or politicians is just wishful thinking. It’s not going to happen. Boris and his gang will wriggle out of it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Putin interfered with the #Referendum because he needs to fracture the political and economic power block that is the #EU.  Military action is dangerous and uncertain but with the right stimulus to he can get the nations to destroy the EU and themselves from within.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this surprising? The #BBC didn't cover the #Remain protests in their own country; and the protesters were BBC licence payers!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Making #RebeccaLongBailey #Labour leader would condemn #Britain to at least a decade of #Tory rule. That would destroy so much of what we 'ordinary' people (ie working/middle class, haven't got millions, didn't got Eton) benefit from and rely on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Three cheers for the bull<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson sees himself as having Christlike qualities.  Delusional psychopath<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>As before the election and on #Brexit the #BBC is controlling public opinion and debate not reporting it.  Not the public broadcaster’s role and an abuse of power by those in authority- and at public expense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We should fill Parliament Square singing ‘The Ode to Joy’ (#EU anthem)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No sympathy for the #Brexit turkeys who voted for Christmas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every analysis and forecast, including the government's own, show that the #UK will be poorer after #Brexit; so what are these backers getting out of it? #Putin you can understand, destabilising the European block, but American backers??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson has refused #Scotland a referendum on independence- what’s he afraid of?

<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson and his government have plans to sort this out.

<|startoftext|>The Prime Minister is supposed to deal with the 'hurley burley' of parliamentary scrutiny no matter what party is in power. Does this nannying by #Tory party mean #BorisJohnson isn't up to the job?  Churchill, Eden, Macmillan, Home, Heath, Thatcher, Major, May just got on with it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perhaps #BorisJohnson thought we would build the equivalent of the Channel Tunnel to Australia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JDBakewell Yep, it's a scam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I now avoid #BBC news and current affairs programmes.  Tragic to see the once standard of honest journalism become the broadcast Daily Mail/Daily Express and at licence payers expense.  As #BorisJohnson cosies-up to #Trump the BBC morphs into Fox News<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That means he can influence and even direct recruitment without taking responsibility or be accountable.  #DominicCummings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh yes, #Trump is really likely to care about international agreements and to listen to #BorisJohnson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson has his tongue out ready for #Trump licking so that's one ally. Just him, not the rest if #Britain, though we will be dragged into this storm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the #Tories are going to go along with this?? With their majority?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>'Bosses will earn average worker’s salary by the end of day' - Is this the #Tories advocating communism or is it just another load of populist bulls**t<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the equivalent of hitting the Twin Towers and the Pentagon, actions which outraged most of the world. Which of the American and European cultural sites are now targets? Westminster Abbey? The Eiffel Tower?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boris Johnson international statesman - there’s four words you don’t expect to see together, unless it is in the fake bonhomie of an obituary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably pinned to a palm tree in Mustique<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By the way, #Boris, whether he was right or wrong, Tony Blair’s reputation was tarnished by following a gung-ho #POUS into a Middle Eastern war. You’ve put yourself in the same position after only weeks in power.  You, the #Tories, #Brexiteers never seem to learn from history<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson is gambling #Britain’s safety and security just to cosy up to #Trump; presumably to ensure a post-#Brexit deal.  This is what happens when power is given to self-serving egomaniacs and the problems haven’t taken long to emerge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's must be a market for #Boris fridge magnets. Maybe a rear view of him disappearing inside or his towselled mop head peeping out to see if the coast's clear<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unfortunately #BorisJohnson has abdicated from any involvement in world politics, possibly because he realises he's not up to the job.  To him #NazaninZaghariRadcliffe's plight is just collateral damage; after all, she's not likely to vote for him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe they will do an #AnnWiddecombe and get onto Strictly Come Dancing to up their profile. Or perhaps 'I'm a Celebrity' in the jungle where, with any luck, they might get eaten by something, even the other contestants.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wherever he is it's not #BorisJohnson.  Even if he had the skills #Boris is too far in thrall to #Trump to speak against him or try to moderate his excesses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amusing diversion 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This man isn’t as stupid as he looks. He’s cunning, he knows how to appeal to the basest instincts to get people to vote forhim; and he has bottomless wealth based on inheritance  However, whenever he appears, speaks or writes, the words ‘fucking’ and ‘idiot’ automatically unite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tragically WW3 will not last long enough to draft in new troops; especially with a self-serving maniac with his finger on the button<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounding Big Ben to signal #Brexit and the death knell of #British prosperity, freedom and honest politics, is a direct insult to the 48% who voted #Remain in the bent #Referendum and all those who voted for Remain parties in the election<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This schmuck is too arrogant to notice we've spent a lifetime paying to fund these inadequate pensions  Retirees are not all fit enough to do charity work and some are recipients 'Charity work' is a euphemism for "there's a job needs doing but we're not going to pay you to do it"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #BorisJohnson comes out of hiding to comment on the Iran killing he would have to either endorse #Trump's action or criticise  If he endorses, #UK will be a target for reprisals; if he criticises he alienates his personal ally from whom he is trying to get a post-#Brexit deal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And #Trump's presidentship-saving military attack is the perfect excuse for #Putin to escalate atrocities in the Middle East. He can pour in unlimited money, troops and hardware. Unless, of course, Trump has risked a world war on Putin's behalf  I'm off to dig a nuclear shelter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And after #Brexit the #UK will be drawn into this as #BorisJohnson aligns ever closer to his mentor #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump’s action comes at a time when #BorisJohn is divorcing the #UK from the #EU, one of the world’s great power blocks, and aligning itself with the #US. The attack on #Iran will prompt violent reaction against the #US and the #UK will get drawn in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Presumably #BorisJohnson means it’s going to be a ‘fantastic’ year in the sense of unbelievable, something of monstrous horror<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too little, too late -  it's #JeremyCorbyn's style of leadership<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In this country we give them knighthoods<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ok, #BorisJohnson, you led the #Brexit move to return to a mythical, empire-ruling #Britain so here's some good old Anglo Saxon language for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Regrettably the cheats, liars, spivs and charlatans are the ones the great British public voted into power.  The December election showed turkeys could be persuaded to vote for Christmas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In days gone by, being a crook, adulterer, or proven liar would be grounds to bar selection as an MP, or cause resignation. Now they are a basic qualification; at least for the #Tories. Not sure about #Labour; they seem to prefer adherence to dogma.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now is punishing #JohnBercow for defending democracy and #parliament and is blaming the judges for upholding the law and stating the proroguing parliament was illegal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With friends like #BorisJohnson we don’t need enemies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You mean the #BorisJohnson who, as London Mayor, bought water cannon to use against his own people, was seduced into spending millions of public money on a bridge that nobody wanted and would have ruined the river vista. Plus many other self-promoting scams.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too little, too late!  History’s greatest condemnation #JeremyCorbyn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I did not think I would ever feel this aggressive about another person. That’s what modern politics has brought the world to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m not Irish or Catholic but share the same sentiments.  The only thing I wish to read about #BorisJohnson, #JacobReesMogg, #NigelFarage, #MichaelGove and some others is an obituary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any perceived 2020 improvement will be just government spin.  #Brexit pain will be blamed on #EU; declining living standards will blamed on withering magic money tree and a mythical tide of immigrants; obscene profits &amp; honours for wealthy will be ‘reward for toil and innovation’<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Spirit of 2020!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just what we need to know. #RebeccaLongBailey = #JeremyCorbyn Mark 2. Another #Labour no-hoper.  Rebecca Long-Opposition<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Leak/publish the #RussiaReport in full, no reactions, no cover-up, no spin; just the open and honest truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vive La France! Vive Europe!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There isn't much else worth watching. The TV companies seem to be scheduling uninspiring programmes to push people into using paid for channels.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is coming to post-#Brexit #Britain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And it’s so much less than farmers get from the #EU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It also accounts for the non-committal attitude to #Brexit and the aspirational but unrealistic election policies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s because #JeremyCorbyn and his followers see #Labour as a perpetual protest group. Being in government would remove their reason for being Ironically, the worse #Tories make life for ordinary people and the more the elite benefit, the more #Corbynites have to protest about<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JeremyCorbyn sees #Labour as a perpetual protest movement rather than a party in power; which could explain the lack of reality in efforts to win the election.  Maybe, as a closet #Brexiteer, he was prepared to hand #Britain to the peril of a #Tory future just to leave #EU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where can we sign this petition?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>'Progressive patriotism', sounds like a slogan the Nazis would invent to justify ethnic cleansing; or the #Tories along the lines of 'compassionate capitalism' to cut social support. It does not fit with #Labour values, or at least policies that will get them into power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And let's see #NHS investment without it being sold-off to #Trump or anyone else<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson plan to spend billions on #NHS is a means of channeling public money to private firms he is going to bring in to run it Idea this statement has any public benefit is as hollow as #Tory promise to build thousands of new houses. Total since they’ve been in power - nil<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson claiming #Tories will spend millions more on #NHS is worrying, given their track record If you can remember when BT was publicly owned, Thatcher starved it of money so it was crippled to breaking point, then invested loads of public money in it before selling it off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where can we sign?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Additional worry is, as this appears in hyper right-wing Telegraph, it is part of an assault to shut BBC or make it a govmnt propaganda unit at public expense  Perhaps selling #LauraKuenssberg to a Fox News type agency where bias and falsehood are standard would start a clean up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BBC news showed strong pro-#Brexit bias, both in content and presentation, and were definitely plugging #Tory line during the election. Now #BorisJohnson has his grip on power the government accuses BBC of being anti-Brexit and hostile to #Tories. Definite manipulation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>works for the minority, rewards his gang and punishes better men and women<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But #IainDuncanSmith has. Shows the moral compass of this government-or the lack of one.  The attacks on judges have started, the #BBC has taken flack already, despite heavily backing #BorisJohnson and #Brexit.  A quiet version of Hitler's 'night of the long knives'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not only is #BorisJohnson making himself dictator and reducing parliament to an elected rubber stamp to benefit an elite; as a leading #EU member the #UK had influence and input into all the rules and regulations from which we have benefited. Now we are the Zimbabwe of Europe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ironically, having pushed #Brexit, promoted #BorisJohnson and his gang, allowed #LauraKuenssberg to be a government cheer leader, Boris now claims the #BBC is biased for #Remain. There was no evidence for that. It's just Trumpian propaganda and an open threat to BBC's existence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Tories are not only lying about the future they are lying about the past<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If there is a dot of truth in this it can only be because #Brexit has pushed the #UK economy so far back it's starting from such a low point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or anywhere else, including the #UK, unless they meet #BorisJohnson's high level income threshold and are prepared to support him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds like a model #BorisJohnson may adopt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me neither. I avoid news, especially #BBC; the recent past has been depressing enough, #UKs future with the crooks in charge can make you suicidal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many forecourt air pumps take 50p coins. If any of this offensive currency is foisted on me it will be used to pump up tyres. An invisible outcome spending its time endlessly rotating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The tragedy of the vote to strip Brits of their rights is that some #Labour MPs colluded.  Betrayal of their party and the people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So far #Brexit has just been a nebulous notion with the word 'deal' bandied about. Nobody says what the deal actually is. What a pity #Britain's status in the world is reduced to the level of barrowboy trading.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Queen certainly did not look happy delivering #BorisJohnson's screw #Britain speech. She knows enough to see the disaster coming for ordinary people and democracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the Scottish people vote for independence we have to respect their referendum on it.  Respecting a referendum, no matter how damaging, no matter how the cases were presented, isn’t that the principle we have to work by now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#IainDuncanSmith was always delusional.  He was the worst #Tory leader of modern times with Corbyn-like qualities repelling voters in droves.  Met him once; not impressed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would #ITV have the nerve to re-run Rick Mayall’s ‘The New Statesman’ series now?  The #BBC certainty wouldn’t.  Go on TV channels, do it, we dare you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stupid old fools. They are old enough to remember the terrible state the #UK was in before we joined the #EU.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Presumably #BorisJohnson means he is going to celebrate totally screwing #Britain with #Brexit by going on a personal procreation rampage.  He seems to believe his privilege and position entitle him to 21st century ‘droit du seigneur’.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can judge someone by the company they keep. More fascists in the #Tory party will just blend in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rebecca Long-Bailey aka #Labour Long-Opposition<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Danger is EU standard foods will be at farmers' market prices, worthy but unaffordable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fully agree, this is highly undesirable, but the public has chosen the path of self-destruction and a mechanism needs to be introduced to provide some guarantee of production standards.  Without #EU regulations the poor will be exposed to low grade food as the norm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well yes, there would be two classes; for example, WTO chlorinated American chicken and infected pork (recent news on that) and quality-assured #EU grade. Presumably if you’re happy to #Brexit you’re happy to play the Russian roulette with your food Same applies to other products<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s an interesting concept. We could a have two tier system with lower grade unbadged products or marked ‘WTO’ grade and higher standard ‘EU approved’.  #EU #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Putin must be dancing round the Kremlin in ecstasy, watching the West self-destruct in stages.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DominicCummings, #BorisJohnson and the rest of the gang are sort of wide boys who exploit the loopholes rather than the spirit of the law. They abuse democracy and the parliamentary system like a bent used car dealer or an underworld lawyer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Germany in the 1930's, India today, Britain tomorrow.  #BorisJohnson's #Brexit Britain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He will soon be followed by Lord Farage of #Brexitshire.  He will sit on the same bench as Lord Aaron Banks  They look after their own.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh no! #Labour is about to appoint Corbyn2! Either party leaders are committed to permanent opposition or they're closet #Brexiteers, happy to kill off #NHS, destroy social services and endorse #Tory power for a generation, because that's how long it'll take democracy to recover<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Difficult to sit back and watch the #BorisJohnson shitshow unfold when the shower of shit is falling on you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surprise surprise.  Sure signs the #Tories are in power<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson and ‘better nature’; two things you don’t expect in the same sentence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre Normally politics are just frustrating.  Since Tory power started to bite, plus rise of Farage et al, blatant bias of right-wing press, corruption of BBC, and downright stupidity of fellow Brits, particularly the older generation who should know better, frustration became anger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh please no! Not another #Labour no-hoper to replace #JeremyCorbyn!!!  Or is this a plot because Labour prefers to be in opposition and secretly wants #Brexit, privatised #NHS,  decimated social services and so on?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even someone as disinterested in politics as I am could see #Labour made itself unelectable by appointing #JeremyCorbyn leader.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is worse than any day of political change in British parliamentary history<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The day #JeremyCorbyn was made leader #Labour made itself unelectable.  #Tories used that, plus media manipulation and new on-line dirty tricks, to get hold of power for a decade.  Corbyn’s leadership vacuum made a lying crook and his arrogant administration the preferred choice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the #Tories win nothing will be done about #LauraKuenssberg's illegal action. It will be swept under the carpet but will tighten the government's grip on the #BBC and confirm it as the #Tory communication department.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rabinows Law, directly applicable to #BorisJohnson and the #Tories -  'If the man at the top is no good  all the people below him will be no good in the same way.' (Jacob Rabinow, US National Bureau of Standards)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Especially a #Trump supplied chlorine washed chicken.  #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently, at Eton the pupils are not even taught to spell 'statesman', let alone behave as one.  #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Save the #NHS Save the #BBC Save society Save #Britain Sack #BorisJohnson Scrap #Brexit  Scrap the #Tories<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This would be the #UK long-term future if #BorisJohnson is allowed to trade the #NHS in a deal with #Trump.  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can always tell when #BorisJohnson is lying - his lips are moving.  and  Boris Johnson lies as easily as he breathes and just as frequently<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've lived under 13 Prime Ministers; some better than others.  #BorisJohnson and his administration is singular in being totally venal and actively working against the national interest  Corrupt, self-serving, dishonest,  blatantly underhand and unfit for office in any capacity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Tory party has morphed over decades from days of Churchill, Eden, Macmillan and the like, who represented privilege but with some social conscience, to what we have now, Stock Exchange Tories out for greed and self-interest, where personal wealth is the only indicator of worth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best of luck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#EU rules provide for immigrant control but the British government has chosen not to implement them.  #PritiPatel is part of the #Tory administration that has knowingly not controlled EU immigration.  Constructive neglect to promote #Brexit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So far the London Bridge terrorist killings are the only thing #BorisJohnson has not yet claimed were done because people want to 'get #Brexit done'.  Don't worry, he'll get round to it, a man with no moral compass and the motivation of a rat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #BorisJohnson believes #Trump is "out of his mind" why is he copying Trump's techniques and attitudes?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DominicCummings, leading #Tory strategist, proposes cutting Sure Start because 'it's a waste of money educating the poor'. He believes the poor are genetically inadequate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PritiPatel you’ve had nine years to change this law and haven’t seen the need - but then we’re in election land with mud slinging, distorted spin and #Tory fake news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson should care about 10 million children in poverty - he's leader of the party that created the poverty for most of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I avoid watching all programmes of this kind. I'd be throwing things and paid more for the television than any #Tory #Brexiteer is worth - and that's for a pretty ordinary television.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fear is #Tories will win despite being worst government since WW2 and having a lying crook as a leader.  People will vote for #BorisJohnson because he's not #JeremyCorbyn.  Tories have allowed #Brexit to mask  other policies while boring people until they don't care what happens<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the release if the terrorist who killed innocent people yesterday is directly attributable to the #Tory Home Secretary in 2012.  Home Secretary in 2012 - #TheresaMay and she's keeping quiet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And not just the hospitals.   Documents #JeremyCorbyn distributed were not specific about #NHS. They showed that #US wants a hand in all areas of #UK public services.  Healthcare, roads, police, border security, social services, you name it, US wants to profit from UK taxpayers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's the #JeremyCorbyn effect.  #Labour made itself unelectable the day Corbyn was made leader and the party is determined to live up to that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Inability to feel shame - a characteristic of the psychopath.  #BorisJohnson, no ordinary crook.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #BorisJohnson get even closer to #Trump we may all be toting guns.   Maybe a concession so the #US gun lobby can sell firearms to the #UK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If only #NicolaSturgeon could be PM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't try to convince us the #BBC is finalt developing some backbone!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are stuck between a crook and a hard case.  Though #BorisJohnson is a proven liar and crook #JeremyCorbyn's policies, especially on #Brexit, are too fuzzy to really justify the 'hard case' title.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While #LauraKuenssberg was mocking #JeremyCorbyn’s government documented evidence of #US intentions to cut a swathe into provision of #UK taxpayer-funded infrastructure, including the #NHS, it was notable she was wearing a very #Tory blue coat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And #BBCNews are undermining truth and seriousness of #US demand for #NHS access as part of #Brexit trade deal  #BorisJohnson is so into #Trump access to NHS and other #UK infrastructure will be given as part of an old boys’ deal  UK starts with little negotiating strength anyway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Tories are venal, self-serving and corrupt but will just bluster on knowing people will vote for the appalling #BorisJohnson and his cronies because he is not #JeremyCorbyn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1. #Labour leader does not attract voters or unite MPs  2. No definite policy on #Brexit (if the leader backed #Remain there would be a surge in support) 3. Policies are ‘hazy’ 4. Failure to robustly deal with anti-semitism claims early enough giving media a chance for bad press.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surely Laura Kuenssburg couldn’t be one of #BorisJohnson’s ‘peccadilloes’? Nah! Impossible! Mind you, it would explain a few reporting anomalies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The election problem is many 'floaters' will vote for #BorisJohnson, despite being a self-serving, self-publicising, duplicitous crook, but because he is not #JeremyCorbyn.  Corbyn has the leadership appeal of a wet fish but he gives #Tories too many opportunities to demonize him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is #Trump trying to interfere with the #UK election (he has form for manipulating foreign politics) or is he just running away from impeachment proceedings?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson is just one candidate for ‘most hated man in #Britain’.  #NigelFarage is a front runner along with #JacobReesMogg.  #MichaelGove may not be quite human enough to be in the contest; then, of course, there’s #MarkFrancois<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Labour party made itself unelectable the day #JeremyCorbyn became leader  He may be sincere and have commitment to worthy social policies but fudges key issues, eg #Brexit, and is highly divisive.  The result will be another worse #Tory government and Labour irreparably weakened<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have reached a point where we just have to look on while the unscrupulous blatantly behave for their own ends and the people have no means of challenge or redress.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unfortunately you reported it to the Metropolitan Police who, like the BBC, have shown themselves totally in the government’s grip and unwilling or unable to challenge or investigate #BorisJohnson, or any member of the #Tory party and their backers, on anything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every financial forecast, including #Tory ones (#JacobReesMogg says it will take 40 years to recover) predicts a major setback for the #UK economy if we commit #Brexit.  #BorisJohnson saying leaving the #EU will boost the economy is either self-delusion or just another lie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes ‘Slippery’ Gove; so true.  ‘Creepy Grease-Smogg’ seems to be keeping a low profile since his Grenfell Tower gaff clarified his feelings about ordinary people; those are the ones without millions in the bank who didn’t go to Eton.  #MichaelGove #JacobReesMogg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a state we have become  Great Britain is now Shitty Britain  #Brexit #NigelFarage #BorisJohnson #Tories<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I refuse to drink in a #Wetherspoons pub and would never buy a #Dyson product. Will not patronize organizations run by people who publicly support inflicting the harm of #Brexit on their own country<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Same mentality that got #Trump into power. #BorisJohnson is the idea6role model<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crooks like Boris eventually damn themselves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #BorisJohnson publishes the Russian infiltration report it will reveal how #UK politics and #Tory funding is influenced by #Russia.  If he does not publish the report it admits a massive cover-up of how UK politics and Tory funding is influenced by Russia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #Tories promise they will borrow billions of pounds to 'invest', ie to undo damage done under their austerity regime.  If #Brexit is supposed to save #UK billions in contributions why do they need to borrow money?  Another Brexit lie exposed by their own actions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #UK's loss is the #US's loss. They're welcome to him. No doubt #Trump will have a vacancy.  #NigelFarage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's the key problem. For 40 years there have been no media reports of the #EU work or investments   EU only gets news time when something negative happens, like #Farage and his gang causing a national embarrassment in Brussels, or to generate myths such as EU straight bananas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If only there were assurance that voting #Labour would stop #Brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, but what will #Labour policy be on #Brexit?  If #JeremyCorbyn spends months negotiating another ‘deal’ that he likes then the default position will be to ask people to back it.  #Remain may be on the ballot paper but there will be the subtext ‘Remain if you must’ (we must!)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely right. Pity #Labour doesn’t provide a trustworthy alternative with a clear #Brexit policy. The fear is floating voters will back the #Tories, not because they like #Boris, but they don’t like the alternative and haven’t got the commitment to vote for a #Remain party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely on the nail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What nonsense! #Tories don’t need #Labour to demonise them - they are doing it to themselves Pursuing policies that undermine society and benefit of a select stratum of the population will inevitably find them out.  The right-wing media cannot cover for the ‘nasty party’ forever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You’re probably right, if the offer was #PeoplesVote with #Remain being party policy  Unlike #Labour who are offering a #Referendum but with #JeremyCorbyn renegotiating #Brexit which he would inevitably push as the preferred option. Same as #Tories but with delay and another vote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandomPersonLiv How can you be a #Labour Remainer and support a Labour #Brexit? Sounds like an oxymoron.  If you’re a Remainer with any party surely you don’t want Brexit in any form?  Can you clarify please so I understand<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Democracy as a commodity has become blatant. #Tories are shameless since #TheresaMay openly bought #DUP votes for her administration with a billion of public money.  Nothing wrong with spending on any part of #UK but that should be part of a proper programme<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly, a benefit of being in the EU; a wide range of food, freedom of choice, knowing it has to meet minimum quality standards, production and processing. Food is wholesome, including chicken, even if you can’t detect the benefit in the taste. Any good reasons for Leaving yet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenniferCoogan1 @indymeansindy Of course we can always look forward to having to buy American chlorinated chicken and other low-grade imports.  Any GOOD reasons to leave with the relevant facts to back them up?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenniferCoogan1 @indymeansindy You said that before.  Food banks aren’t a symptom of #EU membership and when they started there was no talk of quitting the EU to do away with them, just as running away now will close food banks.  It will make producing our food more difficult and reduce the market to sell it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s why this election is going to be such a mess. Hard-nosed #Tory #Brexiteers #Remain parties without the critical mass #Labour who want another #Referendum but will not commit to their #Brexit/Remain policy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CliveEfford Will #JeremyCorbyn commit #Labour to #Remain? If not voting Labour this time round is too risky.  At an individual level you would be the preferred choice, but without a definite statement from the top the choice has to be a Remain party.  Can’t risk ‘Vote Labour get #Brexit’<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenniferCoogan1 @indymeansindy And the 30+ years before?  If being in EU was causing so many problems why did every PM from Heath to May (a pre-referendum Remainer) endorse being in Europe and those still alive continue to do so.  The problems you quote started from the financial crisis which began in the US<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenniferCoogan1 @indymeansindy You’ve listed the result of the Tory austerity drive which Boris Johnson is trying to gloss-over with pre-election spending promises. None of these were major problems before 2010 and certainly not in nearly 40 years of EU membership. So what is leaving the EU going to change?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenniferCoogan1 @indymeansindy So break the circle and give three good reasons for leaving the EU. I’m old enough to have lived in Britain pre-EU and in it. Believe me before we joined Europe UK was on its knees. Britain’s been much ‘Greater’ for the last 40 years than the 40 before. If that’s obsessive - fine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenniferCoogan1 @indymeansindy #EU isn’t a ‘protectionist superstate’ it’s a union of sovereign states working together for mutual benefit and being together provides benefits greater than the sum of the parts  Now, can you come up with, say, three benefits of quitting the EU with evidence to support it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenniferCoogan1 @indymeansindy So you can’t explain it yourself? And do you, like Sara, believe in an independent Wales, because that would mean independent Scotland and Northern Ireland, if that’s the ‘will of the people’? Scotland and N Ireland voted Remain and, if polls are  right, Wales would too now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So what are the benefits of leaving the #EU and where is the evidence?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenniferCoogan1 @acgrayling So what are the benefits of quitting the #EU, other than a blue cover to your entry-you-nowhere passport?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All fine and dandy but there is no point voting for #Labour and a #PeoplesVote unless #JeremyCorbyn irrevocably commits Labour to #Remain.  Allowing Corbyn to instigate a #Referendum where he can let his latent #Brexit tendencies run riot would just be a trap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenniferCoogan1 @acgrayling That is just totally untrue. I have personal experience of EU research funding and if you bother to look you will see projects all over the country with signs showing they were done with EU finance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But would a vote for #Labour ensure   #Brexit is cancelled or that we get another #Referendum with Labour backing #Remain? Not convinced with #JeremyCorbyn as leader.  Even if that's the plan before the election there's no faith he would keep his word.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenniferCoogan1 @acgrayling So far there has not been one good reason to leave or any provable benefit #Brexit is just delusion, smoke and mirrors What's really annoying is the old people who want to recreate a mythical UK when they're old enough to remember the terrible state UK was in before we joined EU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenniferCoogan1 @acgrayling We had a referendum based on lies, misinformation and misrepresentation.  The #Referendum was an anti-immigration vote stoked up by a continual stream of illegal immigrant horror stories in the media which, hey presto!, disappeared the day after the referendum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the government refuses to release the report on Russian manipulation of #UK elections it must have something to hide.  #BorisJohnson #Tories<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenniferCoogan1 @acgrayling UK contributions over what it gets back are peanuts and we get a great deal for the money. Benefits include travel freedom, security, working protection  guaranteed food standards, etc, etc. The only money thrown away in EU is the cost of #NigelFarage and #Brexit MEPs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenniferCoogan1 @acgrayling No, it has contributions from member countries which are redistributed to projects and activities. Eg, much of #UK research is #EU funded, as are many UK infrastructure and social projects. The £350 million a week claim on the bus was a lie, even #BorisJohnson admitted it on air<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acgrayling Vote for #Brexit and get the ‘THS’ #Trump Health Service - for what that would be worth.  Write this on a bus #Boris: “Send no more to Brussels- give £350 million a week to #US health companies”  At least in the #EU we got the money back rather than adding to US profits<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This election is about #Brexit and the #Referendum was about immigration. The referendum result was manipulated and the outcome of this election will be a mess. A right-wing crook leading one side and an untrustworthy closet #Brexiteer leading the main opposition. What a state!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NigelFarage #BorisJohnson and #Trump the unholy trinity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The cost of health care in post-#Brexit #Britain!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@francesbarber13 No doubt #JeremyCorbyn would be happy if we all had an allotment- if the #Tories haven’t already built on them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexiteers such as #NigelFarage and #JacobReesMogg have stated that another #Referendum would kill #Brexit- that's why we are denied the opportunity.  #BorisJohnson will just do what the #ERG  tell him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Fracking will be back on after the election if the #Tories get back - a double worst-case scenario.  Social issues (inc #NHS) only matter when there's votes at risk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hopefully #JamesCleverly will be sharing space with #Boris ‘dead in a ditch’ Johnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How will #BorisJohnson and #MichaelGove wriggle out of this one, because wriggle out they will.  #Boris the Bad has no integrity or moral compass so he will just ignore the law and charge on.  We can only hope #Trump is impeached and the #UK follows suit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#UK imposes no restrictions on EU free movement by choice!  It also has no count for incomers or exiting passengers  Other EU countries are more stringent: eg counting incoming &amp; outgoing immigrants, whether they are out of employment for more than 3 months.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BREXIT MYTHS - Immigration  #EU rules only require free movement up to 3 months unless a person acquired a job or has adequate means to live, otherwise they can be returned to the EU country from which they came.  Other restrictions are up to the sovereign country’s government!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No mention of this on Channel 5 news; bet the #BBC also happened to be looking the other way when #BorisJohnson got the bird.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pity #KenClarke, someone worth respect, is associating with #IainDuncanSmith, someone worthy of contempt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just don't trust any of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How #Britain plans to #Brexit  https://t.co/Smpj0PXpHj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are really going to miss #JohnBercow.  Hope the #Tories do not manage to replace him with a manageable #Tory toady<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>as Corbyn and co are closet #Brexiteers it may be a case of vote Labour get Tory.  If Labour will not come out as a #Remain party they have to guarantee a #PeoplesVote - and how long will it take for them to renege on that promise?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This as hollow a piece of rhetoric as ‘Make Britain great again’ or its begetter ‘Make America great again’.  #Labour has been an ineffectual opposition under #JeremyCorbyn and would be equally impactless as a government  The only reason for voting Labour is it’s not #Tory but -<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great, as long as the political advertising isn’t there disguised as ordinary tweets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is there any hope that the female #Tory quitters include #PritiPatel #LizTruss and #AngelaLedsom?  #Parliament would have so much more credibility by their just leaving.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are the 'good' #Tories stepping down or are they being pushed off the ladder?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So only 20% of goods exported from the West Midlands go to the #US; which means the bulk of the remaining 80% goes to the #EU, our largest trading partner, 50% more cars go to the Europe than to to the US. And you want #UK to quit EU!  What is it you have for brains, #LizTruss?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JacobReesMogg and 'trust' - two things that do not go together<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MarkFrancois spontaneous combusting - there's something to watch #Parliament for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice thought but the #Conservative Party is a many-headed hydra. Cut one head off the monster and it will still survive. #JeremyCorbyn is no Hercules to deal with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Clarification on the radio this morning of why #BorisJohnson is trying for a December 12th election - it’s when many students will be in transit and not voting.  That would exclude a large number of potential anti-#Tory anti-#Brexit voters.  Gerrymandering again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thought #KateHoey already had defected to the #Brexit Party.  She’s just a mole in #Labour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>'The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing' John Stuart Mill 1867, quoted by John F Kennedy. They knew human nature and nothing changes.  We have #Brexit because #Remainers didn't vote; we have this government because better #Tories keep quiet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AndreaLedsom please don't peddle these fantasies.  #UK workers would be at the mercy of capitalist exploitation. #Brexit day one would look the same; in two years it would be a different world. We'll be back to industrial confrontations that dogged #UK before we went into #EU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MarkFrancois - Mickey Mouse Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shows this government doesn’t know whether it’s coming or going - hopefully going.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And #Trump showed he has a massive, more foul, swamp of his own to impose; and #BorisJohnson uses him as an example and mentor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks as if the politicians have more sense than the audience member<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can we at least hope that #MarkFrancois is an endangered species?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson refusing to be challenged or answer questions- again.  ‘Power without responsibility – the prerogative of the harlot throughout the ages.’ - Stanley Baldwin (not perfect but a far better PM)  Though Boris avoids justifying actions in this case he is responsible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As #BorisJohnson is shameless and does anything for self-promotion he's an easy fall-guy for #Brexit backers, #ERG and far-right groups.  He blusters and says meaningless Trumpian sound bites to keep Brexit lumbering on.  Failures don't matter as long as there is no #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre Don’t worry about it. We’ll all need therapy after #Brexit is done to us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope this is true. Recent experience  shows there are too many #Labour MPs supporting  the #Tories to have faith that proper scrutiny will take place and the consequences fully analysed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sick of the #Brexit arrangement being called a 'deal'. #Brexiteer politicians consider the British people just a commodity to be traded and the destruction of our future with that of the Union just collateral damage.  We are entitled to better than that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit has become a war of attrition. Rather than have a #PeoplesVote, #UK's corrupt government has twisted and turned to prolong the process so long it has successfully worn the conscience of #Labour MPs away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Braine by name, not by nature.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stupid stupid woman. How did she get elected when there must be better people in the South West Norfolk Conservatives?  Unless #LizTruss is 'normal for Norfolk'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unfortunately true<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Before a #Referendum the public must have all details of the Withdrawl Agreement plus an analysis of the consequences.  It would be a fraud to ask people to vote for an unspecified 'deal' as if we were just gullible punters  Then we vote #Remain and stop the #Brexit nonsense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No doubt #PiersMorgan has a vested interest in #Brexit.  Maybe he's being paid by #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only benefit #Britain might get from #Brexit, #NigelFarage leaving the #UK.  If we do leave #Europe new laws restricting entry should mean he can be barred for life - result!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When it comes to vile #PiersMorgan  is the exemplar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh Jacob Rees-Mogg - what a cunning stunt !  #JacobReesMogg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I fully support the #BBC licence fee but the news service has to be purged of the government propaganda role.  A review of the background of news service staff has to be done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does Mrs Gove think she and #MichaelGove are the standard of normality? Lord help us!  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#IainDuncanSmith is a deluded bastard. Being interviewed in the lobby of Parliament after #BorisJohnson's latest fiasco he said (I'm sure) the people outside were demonstrating to get #Brexit done. The people outside were demonstrating to stop Brexit and have a #PeoplesVote!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre Can you tell the difference?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GloriaDePiero @OnnMel Evidently a person who will do as they are told regardless of evidence or  conscience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's news?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>10 years!! If #Labour supports #Brexit, either as a whole or individual MPs, they have lost my vote for ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson shares top spot on my hate list with #JacobReesMogg #NigelFarage and #MichaelGove.  Followed closely by #PritiPatel #SajidJavid and quite a few leading #Brexiteers.  Refuse to use anything #Dyson and will never drink in a #Weatherspoons<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So true - until #BorisJohnson gives #Gibraltar to Spain as a #Brexit bonus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Femi_Sorry @UKreality @peoplesvote_uk @OFOCBrexit Where? What time?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre Speaking of Saturday, is the #PeoplesVote March on?  There has been less information this time. When does it start? Where do we gather?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The background behind so many tweets is revealed- so sure of the grip they have on the West they don't bother to put them in English<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh yes, the US officials are bound to care what #LizTruss thinks. It would be a  success for her if they did because nobody else does.  Stupid, ineffectual, deluded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So #Labour has learned techniques from #Tory MP management  What they are being told is a given; there is no 'deal' as good as the deal we have now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With #ExtinctionRebellion protesting to save the planet and #Remainers planning the #PeoplesVote march to save #Britain, #BorisJohnson must wish the water cannons he bought were still available.  Assuming he hasn't got some tucked away; he's the PM  we cannot trust.  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hopefully a couple of million of us  #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which one of these is the ventriloquist and which one the dummy.  #BorisJohnson #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, that's #Brexit exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MichaelGove is making himself a hostage to fortune while being driven to make a fortune for #Brexit backers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>News that #Trump has a heart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does this refer to Syria, Turkey or the #UK? Or the #US?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A #Brexit turkey voting for Christmas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ace plan. Unfortunately #BorisJohnson and his #Brexit obsessives are clamped onto power and are too blatantly determined to flout the law and common decency to permit it.  After all, if they let the people have a say #JacobReesMogg would have to reveal all under new #EU tax laws.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Archetypal #JeremyCorbyn: too little - too late!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There hasn't been much about the #PeoplesVoteMarch on 19th October. Hope it's not going to be a damp squib through exhaustion and apathy.  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We know #BorisJohnson is corrupt. What is new to politics is that he is brazenly corrupt and people no longer care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh Lord! #LizTruss happy to gamble the #UK's future on nothing more than a fortune teller's guess.  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never in the field of national politics has the future of so many been damaged by so few<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #JeremyCorbyn stepped down BEFORE a general election #Labour might have a chance of winning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you do the checks and are happy - check again.  #Trump #BorisJohnsonLies #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Faking communications is not new; technology made it easier and modern politics has normalised lies Assume nothing is real and challenge all of it. Check what politicians and the like appear to be saying against their history. See who is backing them or what they truly represent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only #Brexit benefit for the European Parliament will be to be rid of the disgraceful Brexit Party MEPs. A national embarrassment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JudithBuntingLD Such an accolade! Congratulations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can’t trust anyone these days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True. #JeremyCorbyn is the least effective #Labour leader since Michael Foot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wrong - we want #Brexit cancelled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson is the living example of two political clichés:  You can tell when he is telling lies - his lips are moving.  He lies as easily as breathing - and just as frequently.  The tragedy is that people know and no longer care. Boris has normalised deceit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Believe it when it actually happens.  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump and #BorisJohnson believe the law does not apply to them.  Is this the product of nature or nurture? Are they latent psychopaths or brought up to expect privilege and entitlement?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which means the all-powerful #DominicCummings will have them dismissed or silenced.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only reason for not publishing #BorisJohnson’s statement would be if it was libellous, blasphemous or risked national security.  If it’s the first two we should know as it gives the stamp of the man and please do not try hiding behind security<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hang on. We pay for the #LondonAssembly and #BorisJohnson; now and when he was London Mayor.  If documents concern the probity of officials, especially elected politicians, we, the people, should have access to them.  We are voters and tax payers; do not treat us as lesser beings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What makes #IainDuncanSmith even more despicable is that #Brexit and its effect on the pound contributed to Thomas Cook's demise<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or anybody but #JeremyCorbyn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thought this was #BorisJohnson's CV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson #NigelFarage #JacobReesMogg #MichaelGove #DominicCummings and so on, supported by the right-wing press and gullible gammons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably, as #BorisJohnson is trying to keep as far into #Trump as possible.  If you were British and marry a #US diplomat, would that give you the same immunity? Now there's a question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because #BorisJohnson believes the law does not apply to him and his gang are egging him on then hiding behind his bluster.  #Brexit #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson's claims about fusion energy are reminiscent of the claims Sadam Hussain made about his weaponry as American and allied forces were closing in on him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We can only look forward to Cummings going.  #Britain needs to get back to a state where the country is directed by a democratically elected government not an unelected hired obsessive.  #DominicCummings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #Brexit thugs riot because they do not get their own way it will demonstrate their values, or lack of them. If they riot it will not last.   #Britain has a history of tolerance to all political views but slapping down fascists when they go too far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In an increasingly cashless society, why do we need another £5m of 50p's in circulation? This exercise will cost the value of metal plus minting and distribution.  Is there a 50p shortage? Their main use is for garage air pumps. Are we expecting a lot of #Brexit queue flat tyres?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson's government is hemorrhaging MPs.  If only a few of the #DUP had a shred of integrity instead of sectarian obsession his level of support would be put into perspective<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apoplectic gammons - bit of a tautology.  The propect of #Tory #Brexiteers blowing fuses can only be savoured<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why should they?  #UK knows the rules the #EU trades by, the UK spent 40+ years as a major player in writing them.  Just because UK decided to make itself a foreign country that's no reason for the EU to abandon its standards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Regrettably #BorisJohnson supporters are happy with 'Boris the Lad' bravado.  If Boris had been a woman she would have been pilloried as a slut.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmm.... #JeremyCorbyn behind you - the epitome of 'watch your back!'.  Almost as risky as having #BorisJohnson #JacobReesMogg or #MichaelGove behind you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Totally agree. The same problem exists with many TV channels; the ad breaks are so long you forget which programme you’re watching.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The right-wing press that say that; but then they say #BorisJohnson is a hero.  Presumably the queue is to see #JeremyCorbyn not for the latest I-Phone?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now we suffer #PritiPatel #LizTruss #ArleneFoster and the like.  There are honourable women on the opposition benches but the leading champion of democracy and justice is not in parliament- #GinaMiller.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trouble is #JeremyCorbyn does not inspire people enough to go on a rally. Whatever he does now is too little, too late.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Attorney General may resign - first actual benefit we’ve had from #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>According to a report in tomorrow’s Torygraph #BorisJohnson is planning a cunning stunt in the courts to get round the Benn Act.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@francesbarber13 Congratulations! 🍾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More than can be said of the #Brexit Party MEPs. They just take the money for doing nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't be silly, whiners are whiners; #Brexit just gave them a big target, and it was promoted by politicians who told them what they wanted to hear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dr Beeching, a name on the roll of national infamy. Destroyed so much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not on the #BBC though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In which century are these old gammons living? They didn’t notice Empire became the Commonwealth. Commonwealth countries are further away than #Europe and volume of businesses #UK did with those was far less than with #EU They also forgot the state #UK was in before we joined EU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It would be said women will do a better job, then you remember #PritiPatel #LizTruss #ArleneFoster and the like.  They’re just as bad, sometimes worse, than the men. There seems to be a race to be worse than #BorisJohnson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre To stop people putting leaflets through their door 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beware, #BorisJohnson, the eye of history is on you.  Even if you manage to doctor government papers so the depths of your iniquity are hidden you will be found out.  Future generations will rightly blame their situation and disadvantages on you and your gang of crooks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We know #BorisJohnson is a criminal and certainly cunning in getting unelected power on behalf of a specific group then abusing it.  The thug is #DominicCummings who is an employee with control over government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh Lord! We are finally being governed by The Chuckle Brothers.  #BorisJohnson #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shhhhh......don’t shout about it, they’ll just invent more lies and accusations then develop a thicker skin. #Trump &amp; #BorisJohnson are the kind of politician who meet criticism or accountability with blind attack. Just let pressure and evidence build then deliver the killer blow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@francesbarber13 @trickortreatuk Hmmmm......Very stylish, very elegant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There must an analogy for #ArleneFoster from ancient times; after all she is a dinosaur  Maybe Medusa, the Gorgan monster with venomous snakes for hair and whose look would turn people to stone.  The personification of reactionary evil; barring the way to others for self interest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There’s a simple way to identify #BBC bias, especially #BBCNews and current affairs, just listen to it.  Gammon in Chief #JohnHumphrys may have quit but a national broadcaster acting as government mouthpiece has institutionalised bias.  Just check CVs of those working on #Today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And remember, that’s a #BorisJohnson government promise with all the value that has.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, for a person who takes medication (like me) the options are:  #Brexit and have the Russian roulette of knowing whether medicine will be available on the assurance #BorisJohnson’s government says people won’t die Or #Remain with stability and prosperity   Decisions, decisions!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this #BBCNews piece ambiguous or just badly written?  If #BorisJohnson is to ask for an extension if 'no deal is agreed' does parliament have to agree to leave #EU with no deal or that a deal has to be agreed by parliament and EU by 19th?  Either way the people don't get a say<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not true. The #Tories may fragment but there will be a pause then the parts will reconstitute as another dreadful monster with a smiley face.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson could be accused of throwing Northern Irish business under a bus, except that Ireland's bus manufacturer, Wrightbus, has just gone into to liquidation with the loss of 1300 jobs. It would have to be an old live-in-the-past bus.  Another #Brexit bonus?  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More faith in #JohnBercow than #JeremyCorbyn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So ask them again- no lies this time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Typical #JeremyCorbyn - too little, too late.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#LizTruss has no idea full stop<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, we're sick of hearing about b #Brexit and all the lies. Sick of seeing the coun6we love sold down the river by #BorisJohnson and his gang.  Simple solution - #StopBrexit  Country carries on as usual, prosperity, peace, freedom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would anyone miss #BorisJohnson at the #EU summit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For #BorisJohnson's Northern Ireland solutions read:  'dead cat thrown on the table'  and 'buses painted on the sides of boxes'.  It's distraction, smoke and mirrors.  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And 40 hospitals? Lego ones possibly.  Or is this a bit of #Tory slight of hand? Add a shed to an existing hospital and call it a new one. Just as in redefine employment and instantly reduce the unemployment figures<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson on the government information channel, #BBCNews, firing #Tory faithful with plans to recruit 20,000 police, thousands of doctors and build 40 hospitals. Is that to replace some of police axed under austerity, doctors and nurses lost through underfunding and #Brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The lies are permanent, the benefits temporary and for a fortunate few, the costs have to be carried by the rest of us for a long time.  #Tories #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And that will be what #BorisJohnson and his backers want not what the country wants or needs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This means post-#Brexit all the sub-standard appliances will be directed to #Britain.  Poor food, bad goods, shortages, the #Brexit bonus. No doubt some #Tory backers will make a fortune out of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is the #Tory party totally populated with these old gammons?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Britain is no longer a democracy it is an ‘Eton-ocracy’. Maybe it always has been; it’s just #BorisJohnson and #Brexit have ripped off the veneer of public interest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He doesn’t need to do that. We know #BorisJohnson is shifty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson is screwing the country; the more we know of his private life it appears he’s spent a lifetime in training, sometimes at public expense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s the #Tory tactic. When you run out of argument and have no moral basis attack the integrity of your opponent.  Don’t try to justify your position just make derogatory accusations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This would be the pot calling the kettle black except #JacobReesMogg is a self-serving national destroyer and #JohnBercow is a champion of parliament and representation of the people Parliament has been brought to its lowest but that’s down to #BorisJohnson and #Tory front bench<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So true and we didn’t need Dominic Grieve to tell us that #BorisJohnson is a ‘pathological liar’ with ‘no moral compass’; it’s blatantly obvious to even the most dyed-in-the-wool #Tory sycophant. Good to know the politicians think the same though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are told #Brexit will cause prices to rise, situation made worse by shortage of supply, notably for food and medicine. Has #BorisJohnson and his government made provision to increase pensions and other benefits for the most vulnerable to cover the price of food and #NHS costs?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Were you there to hand out redundancy notices #BorisJohnson?  Presumably the ones taken on by private heath companies will be ok for a while with TUPE protection; that's if getting rid of transfer protection isn't part of your post-#Brexit strategy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is #MichaelGove suffering from something or in the throes of an ecstatic climax witnessing #BorisJohnson in full bull-in-china-shop #Brexit at all costs dictator mode?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nixon, #Trump, #BorisJohnson - elect a crook and you get what you voted for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watched #BorisJohnson and #Parliament on #BBC to see government view including interviews with #Brexiteer pensioners. Watching #ITV News for more balance. Will watch #Channel4 news for a critical view, doing work politicians should have been doing before we got to the cliff edge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just been notified by #Vodafone that international calls and texts will cost more, some nearly double, from November. Another #Brexit bonus?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So do we all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lessons were in fairly basic technology: "The zip goes up and down like this; a brassiere unhooks like this....."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't wait for #Brexit Nigel.  A quick whip-round would provide the fare -as far as you like.  #NigelFarage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson is unrepentant   https://t.co/CKKqhxXcZc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't normally respond to re-tweet requests but #JacobReesMogg is such a sh1t this one deserves to be spread about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson and #DonaldTrump - both crooks but they will wriggle out from under the piles of sh1t they have created.  We have governments of politicians but no statesmen or stateswomen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gina Miller   Should be Dame Gina Miller<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Presume you are referring to 'Saint No Deal Johnson' aka #BorisJohnson who, as London Mayor, bought water cannon to use against his own people and was persuaded by Joanna Lumley to destroy part of the city and waste millions of public money on a vanity bridge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is the matter with #Labour? The party sticks to a highly divisive leader with less appeal than a dead fish and the lowest public approval of any in recent history. Now it endorses his fudged #Brexit stance that will alienate many voters Must be avoiding winning an election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is turning the clock back to days before secret ballots; where those who had the vote were at the mercy of their landlord or employer. We’ll have rotten boroughs next and a parliament that operates for the rich without democratic representation; oh we’ve got that already.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Labour will not re-emerge until foggy #JeremyCorbyn and the old-time #LenMcCluskyite bruisers are history.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely right. #UK decided to make itself a foreign country to #Europe. To be more accurate, a group of vested interests pumped out lies and false promises that appealed to a lot of mainly old people; consequently 52% of those who bothered to vote wrecked the country’s future<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‘Not quite right’ masterly understatement!  #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dinosaur  #LenMcCluskey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ThomasCook’s collapse is likely to be the start of a #Brexit disaster domino sequence. Once it really starts to bit watch the big names fall. Smaller firms will go down too but that won’t get reported. Thomas Cook was too big to hide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulWelters I think they are one and the same. The cartoon version seems to have more humanity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was #CrispinOdey the model for Peter Griffin in Family Guy? Apart from the physical resemblance they seem to share the same moral compass.  https://t.co/dd2K8hgBtJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The government might well have bailed out #ThomasCook, as they did with the bankers, if the man in charge had been educated at Eton.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hurrah! Double whammy!!  Still in the #EU and the #Tories get paid back for what they’ve done to #Britain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What if next dictator has a normally unthinkable scheme, he/she can suspended parliament and impose it. Euthanizing people over 75, the mentally sick, anyone who is a drain on social services for example.  Plenty in #Brexit Party would be up for that, except so many are over 75<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #Parliament can be suspended at the whim of any Prime Minister in order to push through a personal agenda then he has become dictator, parliament is a sham and just a cipher to endorse his decisions. Proroguing is a dangerous precedent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the ruling goes in favour of #BorisJohnson and his coup then the #British system is rotten and democracy is dead.  The country is at the mercy of those who can buy power and ordinary people can no longer look to the legal system for protection.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JohnHumphrys says the doesn't listen to the pubic, by the public he means him and #NigelFarage. #BBCNews certainly doesn't listen to the #Remain element of the public.  Significant that this old gammon is venting his #Brexiteer bile in the Daily Mail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You mean the bankers who kick-started the recession that cost us all so much, or the bankers that profit from the international problems the pound is having, or just the bankers who make a fortune from personal debt? And these are the ones you trust to endorse #JeremyCorbyn?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JohnHumphrys has left #BBC #Today programme. I bid him a soldier's farewell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With #JohnHumphrys gone #BBCNews might be worth listening   to; unless he is replaced with another right-wing gammon #Brexiteer. Check the CVs of #Today presenters; surprising the number who have been #Tory activists<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #Tories under #DavidCameron started the drive to return to Victorian values; this is evidently what they meant. It's taking hold. People are already living on the streets; presumably we are supposed not to care when rickets reappears.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Explode with joy!  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the 1950's #BBC radio had a slot after the daytime news called 'The Announcements' where government information was read out, usually notices on things people had to do.  #BBCNews has subtly revived this practice and morphed itself into the government propaganda channel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #Conservatives are the party trying to buy back votes by releasing money to services they have spent years starving to breaking point. The amount released is a fraction of  what has been axed.  They are the party of benefiting the few at the cost of the many.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BBC archive programme described early 1970's (before #UK joined #EU) as a period of massive industrial action, hyper-inflation and massive unemployment. Pity they did not point this out to #BBCNews and current affairs department. Maybe BBC is under pressure or just don't care<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmm.......#NigelFarage claims the #BBC are treating him like a war criminal. Didn’t know #BBC still had the balls; unless it’s to make #Tories look preferable to the #Brexit Party Ltd  War criminals were hanged. Interesting prospect in this case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a tragedy; #Labour party refuses to recognise that, no matter how egregious, destructive and self-serving #BorisJohnson is, #JeremyCorbyn is his best PR man.  Unless #Boris were shown to be a paedophile, for which there is no evidence, red neck public will still prefer him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is the #Brexit Party Limited a limited company for some devious reason? Pointless asking really; it’s bound to be.  Could it be that as a limited company it avoids some ethical/financial/legal scrutiny that a bona fide political party would attract?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because they didn't go to Eton<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Proof that the #BBC has become the #Tory propaganda unit, and at public expense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson, proven liar, self-serving self-promoter.

Now killer of democracy and would-be dictator in thrall to his Svengali #DominicCummings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After a lifetime of defaulting to #BBCNews I've abandoned it for #Channel4 and #ITV.  Can still tell the difference between news and questioning compared to propaganda and sycophancy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The #Brexit Party<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hurrah! At last we will be free from that right-wing drain on the licence fee. No doubt the #BBC will find another superannuated gammon to replace #JohnHumphrys.  It would be wonderful to listen to #BBCNews without serious risk to your blood pressure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We’ve all been let down by this #Tory government. You’re a bit late standing up to them.  #JeremyCorbyn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It could but the sequence is wrong. GE first then #Referendum is highly risky as there is no guarantee #JeremyCorbyn would win.  Sequence should be: 1. Revoke Article 50 2. Negotiate deal 3. LET EVERYONE KNOW DETAILS OF THE DEAL WITH CONSEQUENCES  4. Referendum - #Remain or Deal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not holding my breath on this one. The judges in England seem to be more ‘on message’ with #BorisJohnson and #DominicCummings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pre-#Referendum right-wing press and #BBC ran daily scare stories about illegal immigrants trying to get sanctuary in #UK. Day after #Referendum no reports, problem apparently solved.

<|startoftext|>Future children’s stories will feature ‘Boris the Bad’.  If only the disaster we are living through were not just a fiction like the tale #BorisJohnson, #DominicCummings and #JacobReesMogg cooked-up to tell the Queen so they could suspend #Parliament.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As #BorisJohnson has shut #Parliament there is no one to police the government and its devious behaviour.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Scrapping honours means people who have worked hard for society get no recognition. Rotten part is politicians, military, even Civil Servants have prescribed levels of automatic honour based on rank and not achievement. Even worse, politicians get to reward backers and sycophants<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre No; conniving, devious, self-serving, but not stupid. The buffoon act is just to get attention.  #BorisJohnson’s Celtic Bridge is just another cunning stunt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Building a bridge between Scotland and Ireland is a technological fantasy; one of #BorisJohnson’s ‘dead cats’ he throws on the table to distract attention. If HS2is too expensive think what an Irish Sea bridge would cost.  Give him a bus to lie under perhaps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Proroguing #Parliament sets a precedent so dangerous the people should be on the streets protesting. It means anyone who gets themselves Prime Minister, whether they were elected or not, can cut the people’s representation out and impose any policy they like, no matter how bad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Parliament has been suspended and government of #Britain has been commandeered by an unelected individual. We now have a dictator, a Tsar, #Boris the Bad. Or Boris the Terrible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely right. The zealots and fanatics will wait until everyone else is bored and switched off them grab what they want.  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I certainly do not hate #JohnBercow. He has become a hero and defender of democracy. Main concern is that he is going and his replacement may have less integrity and be less able to fight for parliament. Have absolutely no respect for #JuliaHartleyBrewer<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Certainly implemented by the #BBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or is that the worst case. Imagine a cabinet made up of #NigelFarage #BorisJohnson #JacobReesMogg #AnnunziataReesMogg #AnnWiddecombe #PritiPatel #IainDuncanSmith and so on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have a Prime Minister who tried to give himself dictator powers planning to form an alliance with someone who wants to be dictator.  Worst case scenario for #BorisJohnson to offer to step aside and make #NigelFarage PM after election. Boris wasn't elected so there is precident<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If it weren't for the apalling #NigelFarage kicking off the #Brexit shit storm on the back of anti-immigrant nationalism the whole exercise seems to be to protect #JacobReesMogg from tax scrutiny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson is an amalgam of Nigel Molesworth, Billy Bunter and Adrian Mole.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Dead in a ditch is fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can repeatedly present #Brexiteers with all the facts and point out how they will suffer along with the rest of us but they will only hear what they want to hear.  Given the age of so many of those wanting #Brexit perhaps hearing is a problem.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That’s the danger of a general election. #Tories are terrible, #Labour under #JeremyCorbyn does not provide a credible alternative and #LibDems have got too far to go to get a big enough majority. An election now will just stir the mess.  However #BorisJohnson has to be ousted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We need to point out to the #BBC that the people on the streets yesterday were a ‘representative sample’ of people opposed to #BorisJohnson and his plans, not the whole opposition<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If only our national broadcaster had not been reduced to the government propaganda department.  #BBC #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perhaps it might be more effective to march on the #BBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me too. Less decisive than #JeremyCorbyn and with more support than #JoSwinson; much as the #Liberal no #Brexit commitment is preferable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No reply from the Prime Minister on anything. No doubt he is waiting for the protests to run out of steam and #BorisJohnson has the obsessive #DominicCummings whispering in his ear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've had 70 years on this planet under at least 13 Prime Ministers; some effective some not. None blatantly operated for the benefit of an elite and against parliament and the people until #BorisJohnson. He sets a new low in venality and disgraceful political dishonesty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #AmberRudd has such a narrow majority resigning would gain her respect and a chance of retaining her seat. Thin chance maybe with her track record and #Tory association but she has nothing to lose. Unless she really does have no moral base.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VintiquesMark Full agree but it has to be done by people who are refusing to do so.  And #DominicCummings will not allow #BorisJohnson to stop #Britain carrering over the #Brexit cliff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most of the nation seems to agree but how do we force the issue?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can you remember what now seem like the good old days of the Poll Tax; when civil disobedience meant just that and politicians were forced to take notice instead of ignoring the public?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You will have to protest outside Eton College for that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But how are the #BBC spinning it? The usual brief reference to a #Remain or anti-prorogation event countered by a put-down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who the hell is #DominicCummings and who appointed him to run the country, let alone the #Tory party?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t write the #Tories off. Like other virulent life forms, they will go quiet, gather some immunity and then reinfect society.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrahameLucas I think another right-wing repressive regime bought them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We did not vote for #DominicCummings to run our country He must not be taxpayer funded  If #Tory party pays for him he is not subject to Civil Service rules and should not be in a position of power  If he is paid for by secret private funders this is a dark takeover of the state<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who is actually running #Britain? #DominicCummings is giving the orders and controlling government. #BorisJohnson is just the plastic front. Who pays for Cummings? Is he No10 staff paid for by the taxpayer? Is he paid for by the  #Tory party? Is he paid for by secret funders?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Tories have starved schools of cash since they got into power.

<|startoftext|>How come #DominicCummings  has authority to hire and fire government staff?  Was the victim of this treatment given proper legal employment procedures?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thought #TheresaMay was rock bottom as Prime Minister - then #BorisJohnson engineered his way into the job and a whole new pit opened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Notable that #Brexit is timed for Halloween, full of frightful things and dark deeds.  We have certainly suffered a flood of tricks but there will be no treats, certainly not for future #UK generations.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The Old Etonian Prime Minister didn’t have the guts to face the Queen with this crime against democracy and sent his Old Etonian right-wing zealot henchman to do his dirty work.  #BorisJohnson #JacobReesMogg<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@justsnoozing @AngieMeader We cannot rely on a political system where policy decisions land up in the law courts. We would then have a three level legislature and all government would be even more cumbersome. It would mean the courts becoming politicised and judges appointed for political ends as in the US<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justsnoozing @AngieMeader That's the danger and benefit of monarchy. Problem is the monarch cannot defend the people against corrupt politicians without compromising their position.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the monarch can serve no more function than to rubber stamp the Prime Minister’s demands, no matter whether they are good, bad, or downright disgraceful, then the position ceases to have a value.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve always had mixed feelings about monarchy. In a modern state a position based solely on an accident of birth is illogical. However, the system has provided stability, nominally holds PM to account and is a massive focus of attention. And the top royal work hard at it. But<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had to switch #BBCRadioLondon off. Could not tolerate Petri Hoskins reading a stream of messages from #Brexiteers supporting #BorisJohnson.

<|startoftext|>Absolutely right. Despicable political chicanery. Maybe it is so blatant it is actually #BorisJohnson's latest version of 'throwing a dead cat on the table', in this case a dead lion, in order to get MPs to accept his, #Farage's, #JacobReesMogg's, etc toxic plans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexiteer or not, this action should appall and panic everyone.  #BorisJohnson cutting a swathe through democracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>MPs, like them or not, are the elected representatives of the people. #BorisJohnson's government plan to suspend parliament effectively declares war on its own people. Most flagrant abuse of government since Charles 1st<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jim Davidson is referring to a conflict that took place over a century ago and which would not have happened had there been the #EU. 20th century pre-EU 2 European based world conflicts, Spanish Civil War, rise of fascism, genocide etc.  Post-EU no conflicts with EU member states<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>All of that is true; the main point is the money is #UK’s share of costs for projects etc agreed a long while ago when #Brexit was just a bad dream, not the nightmare it has become.

<|startoftext|>There was a word that should have been included in the tweet about #PritiPatel. 'Conflict of interest' doesn't do it. The correct description is CORRUPT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We’ve suffered years of austerity because the public were told we needed it. Now Boris is having a pre-election give away with the money, our money, we were told we couldn’t have and there is no mention of austerity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No need. With access to DWP and other official records, plus the ability to muscle the banks, #BorisJohnson can easily access and cherrypick our bank records.  There will be some excuse, a bit of spin, but we will be shafted just as the #Tories have since getting into power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‘Very sleazy’! You are too kind. #PritiPatel’s action is blatant conflict of interest that in any other situation would get her fired. Shows the gutter state of our current politicians that this behaviour is tolerated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t think ‘might be’ is the case. Unless there were more stupid Presidents in the days when officials were less accountable and the press were kept away. If not #Trump takes the prize.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The very concept of suspending #Parliament to force an issue through is the act of a dictator, even worse a malign despot. To have to propose such action shows the weakness of the policy and that those in power are serving their own ends.  #StopBrexit #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlOxon67 Rationalizing is distorted reasoning to support flawed logic. Peddling distorted facts as a means of 'taking the piss' just to 'have a laugh' is holding people in contempt.

<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson is #Trump’s poodle and Trump is #Putin’s poodle.  It’s the incarnation of the old rhyme:  ‘Big fleas have little fleas upon their backs to bite ‘em; little fleas have littler fleas, and so ad infinitum’.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AlOxon67 How would you define the difference?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlOxon67 Or more succinctly, rationalisation is self-delusion; ‘taking the piss’ is fraud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlOxon67 Rationalizing is convincing yourself that something you want to be true, like #JeremyCorbyn's effectiveness as #Labour leader and potential PM, is true. Taking the piss is peddling ideas that you know to be untrue, see Jeremy Corbyn description above,  to other people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlOxon67 So it's true; you can rationalise anything if you want to believe it or it suits your story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Porkie pies are #BorisJohnson's stock in trade.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Depends which reference you use. Additional research shows #Labour losses greater than first thought.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A bit of research into #Labour history will show when the party was at its strongest and it isn't now.

<|startoftext|>I don’t hate #JeremyCorbyn, I hate what he has done to the #Labour party; I hate it has taken last minute desperation to get him to listen to his own MPs and party supporters.

<|startoftext|>Why didn't you sort out the 'technological solutions' before lighting the #Brexit dynamite fuse?  That assumes that these solutions actually exist and are not just another part of the Brexit benefit fantasy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are plenty of competent catering managers in #NHS. What they need is an adequate budget and freedom to invest in effective food production processes.  Wonderful as Prue Leith is, introducing a celebrity caterer to add sparkle to NHS catering is #BorisJohnson window dressing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boots the Chemist used to supply low-dose asprin loose in neat, recyclable plastic tubs. They have withdrawn tubs and now supply them in non-recyleable mixed material press out bubble sheets in an additional card wrapper  Rather undermines their introduction of paper carrier bags<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump's a liar, #BorisJohnson has been sacked for lying, how many others?  What sort of people are we voting for? They may be in politics but they are not statesmen. Maybe politics is seen as some sort of TV game show and people are voting for the lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least we know who is responsible for this poisonous #Brexit. If #DominicCummings had not been openly appointed #BorisJohnson’s mentor he would have been operating as a dark force behind the scenes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A lie is a lie; it up to media to expose it and the liar, not endorse lies by repetition or neglect.  Facts revealed since #Referendum show voters were lied to. Most successful #Brexiteer politicians are those most skilled at spinning lies into patches to cover #Brexit problems<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1st_Julianna @City_Livery_SM I think you get the point. If we are not in #EU there has to be a real border between the #UK and adjacent countries with the associated problems and delays. The notion of ‘technological solutions’ is just fantasy; unless the plan is to implant chips into all people and vehicles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As well as being a serial liar #BorisJohnson was the Mayor of London who spent Londoners’ money on water cannon to use against our own people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Tories at war with each other or the people?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Essential reading though there are a lot more lies and distortions in the #Brexit script.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson is proving the sort of crass 'leadership' #UK has managed to avoid for centuries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Searching internet for something mundane and innocuous selected a link and was surprised to get message 'This site is not available in your country'.  Never experienced this before.  Must be the sort of thing that happens in China. Hope this doesn't indicate we are being censored<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the unicorn high tech Ireland/UK border solutions only deal with motor traffic, particularly lorries. How will cars and anything in them be policed, not to mention people? With no hard border a potential illegal immigrant just needs to get to Ireland then walk over into #UK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>nous avons tous honte  At least Macron is too polite to ask the British boor to leave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson knows the devastation and chaos but it will hit the country first; then the #Tories, who will be on high blame-shifting mode; Boris will carry the can but he won't care as he'll have got his picture in the No10 gallery of PMs and be on to a job with a #Brexit backer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>'Declare or 'Admit' - amounts to the same. Perhaps 'Admit' implies you knew you weren't up to it all along and just wanted the pension that goes with the job.  #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oldThomo We need both. Cleaning the environment requires investment on many fronts; one of which is getting traffic off roads wherever possible  HS2 is a conduit for North South access with multiple benefits; it is a long-term investment. Maybe #Trump would like to buy HS2 instead of #NHS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You think #BorisJohnson looks like a leader??!  If that's the case it shows how low our expectations have sunk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Taking traffic off the roads benefits the environment and makes travel more efficient. HS2 is a major national investment that will benefit for an indefinite future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#HS2 is a major step towards ironing out a North/South divide. Objectors are taking the same stubborn donkey position as those who objected to building Victorian railways. #British railways were decimated in the 1960's under pressure from road haulers; the same is happening here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True, and if the civil servants who are in touch with the #Brexit realities voted #Remain then they know what they are doing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #Trump cannot buy Greenland maybe he's considering buying the #UK wholesale instead of cherry picking the juiciest parts.  #BorisJohnson would be up for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does this indicate #JeremyCorbyn Will not listen to #Labour MPs or party members but finally responds to social media? #Brexit is a national emergency; Africa has many problems but Corbyn's priority is here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never occurred to him to buy #British beer?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If government has identified #Brexit problems and risks, the public, i.e. voters, tax payers, citizens, should have that information and know the contingency plans in place. We do not vote and pay for an administration to operate in secret for its own ends and keep us in the dark<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VintiquesMark Why should the Galapagos suffer?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brit_bob Presumably it will get harder after #Brexit as UK territories will be foreign countries to EU states and you won’t have to wait long for the sovereignty claims to start.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There may be no sovereignty claims now but post-#Brexit pressure for these to be taken over will be piled on. As Northern Ireland voted #Remain the Republic could have support within N.Ireland. Gibraltar may want to stay #British but don’t look to #BorisJohnson to fight for them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, in simple terms, how is the #Gibraltar (#UK) #Spanish (#EU) border going to be managed? Is there some difference between the N Ireland/Republic interface and Gibraltar/Spain?  There are already calls for reunification of Ireland and Spain has historically pressed to have Gib.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Ireland's border is one massive problem that #BorisJohnson has to solve, the #EU didn't create this situation. What about #Gibraltar? Are we just handing that over to Spain?  Simple way out of all UK's troubles- cancel #Brexit, all problems solved overnight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who would’ve thought it - we all thought it; we all knew it.  Not only is #BorisJohnson’s #NHS ‘boost’ money that had already been allocated but government blocked NHS from spending, it is a fraction of the amount health services have been cut by the #Tory austerity imposed on us<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson #JacobReesMogg #NigelFarage #PritiPatel IDS and so on all have private medicine. What do they care? Losing a swathe of sick and elderly as a result of #Brexit will be dismissed as collateral damage. It will also be spun as a reason for selling the #NHS to the #US<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pensioners in UK NHS UK science and research EU funded infrastructure projects EU funded local developments  UK security  and so on. Not individuals but losses that affect everyone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So far #JeremyCorbyn has proved to be ineffectual but this is insane. Even if the #EU were prepared to simply reverse everything and go back to what we have now, #Brexit has caused so much division and aggression, trying to get #Brexiteers to quietly accept rejoining is fantasy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit happens. #Farage triumphs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As far as we know there are no plans in place to replace the research support from the Treasury<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This #Leaver nonsense omits to acknowledge the swathe of things invented or created in #Europe or anywhere else in the world. It is also total nostalgia and fails to realise so much of #UK research and development is #EU funded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And how many black people, Jews, Chinese and so on in the bleach white #Brexit Co Ltd?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Such cowardice! No point #Labour being 'officially neutral' in a referendum; under #JeremyCorbyn and the current management it has been totally neutered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has #DianneAbbott seen the light at last or is this an indication that #JeremyCorbyn is actually committed to #Remain?  #Brexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hear! Hear! Having said that, #JeremyCorbyn may avoid throttling due to diminished responsibility<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>their health allows. They are not forced to work until they drop.  Older workers  may have skills and experience but companies are not always keen to keep them on.  An older person in work is blocking a job for a young person who needs a career and will contribute in tax etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You pompous pratt! There is no barrier now for people working longer and the pensions service incentivises delaying taking your state pension. The point is working past retirement age is voluntary; people can work on until they feel the time is right and<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is a staggeringly stupid comment because we have a miniscule amount of chlorine in tap water to prevent contamination in the pipework. American chicken is washed in chlorine to cleanse it from infectious material resulting from the poor production standards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True, no outcome will have legitimacy without the people's endorsement, but #Labour has been so weakened under #JeremyCorbyn  general election will result in a bigger parliamentary mess. Danger is #Tories may be returned and #Brexit Party could score points. #PeoplesVote better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't be too pleased. These life forms tend to retreat, adapt, then re-emerge as something more virulent.  #Tories #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who was it said they never believe a leak or rumour until it is officially denied?  #Tories #StopBrexit #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As an old fart myself I fully agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is #Trump’s version of #BorisJohnson’s when you are being held to account throw a dead cat on the table.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which is which? Or are #BorisJohnson and #DominicCummings morphing into a single monstrous entity?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An indication of #JeremyCorbyn’s lack of leadership that he has to plead for support. About as inspiring as a tepid drink of water.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nicholasjenkins Afraid we will have to differ. #TheresaMay is an empty vessel, a chancer who could not handle power. Gave #JeremyCorbyn a massive opportunity to show her and her government up but he wasn't up to it. He could not defend himself, challenge policies or listen to his MPs and members<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree the #Tories created the mess but #JeremyCorbyn's lack of opposition has given them a free hand. He couldn't even stand up for himself in parliament against Theresa May. Watching her verbally  run rings around him was an embarrassment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, #JeremyCorbyn’s ineffective leadership of the opposition is a key reason for the #UK being in this mess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perhaps #Trump believes #Greenland is where the Wizard ofOz lives. If Trump managed to buy Greenland he would try to build a wall round it to stop the Munchins emigrating to the #US.  Or maybe he thinks because ‘green’ is in the name it’s just a big golf course.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>History will be kinder to Tony Blair that the current sit-on-the-sidelines critics throwing stones from the sidelines.  If people had seen what Sadam Hussain was doing to his own people they would have been in favour of removing him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me too. Things really did get better. The day after the 1997 election felt as if a huge weight had been lifted off the country; the same weight that is depressing us now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You’re certainly not alone. More than half #UK feel the same and are angered because ‘dog in the manger’ #Brexiteers who grabbed power refuse a vote on #Brexit.  That would show #NigelFarage neo-Nazis we are not the razor-edged nationalist they admire and would have as #Britain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is #CarrieSymonds being presented as the acceptable face of #BorisJohnson or is she Milania to his #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saying we have to respect the #Referendum is forcing us to respect skulduggery, lies and manipulation. It's the same as saying we have to respect the Mafia, the Krays and the Nazis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds like a plan but don't rely Jeremy 'Chocolate Teapot' Corbyn to see it through.  #JeremyCorbyn #Labour #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Churchill wanted a European Union and Margaret Thatcher believed in it. Two #Tory icons that the right-wing is shunning in favour of toxic #Brexit populism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No one is concerned with blocking #JeremyCorbyn; he is a political non-entity promoted to his level of incompetence. The leader who does not lead of the opposition that does not oppose. His #Brexit stance and refusal to listen has reduced #Labour to a chapter in the history books<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hear! Hear!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Comparing #LizTruss's mental capacity to that of a haddock is so unfair to haddock.  And, as well as having greater intelligence, haddock are at least edible and tasty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Total #Labour bullsh*t when #JeremyCorbyn is #BorisJohnson's best recruiting sergeant.  The current Labour leadership is the only thing that makes the #Tories look electable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fiddling while #Britain burns.  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank goodness for Channel 4 News and it's drive to expose the way we are being shafted. The US's John Bolton is revealed as a nationalist who hates the #EU and the UN despite being US ambassador to the UN for a while. Equivalent of #NigelFarage being an MEP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NigelFarage duplicitous as ever. Margaret Thatcher was pro-#EU and all that came with it.  Could not stand the woman but she was a better negotiator than Cameron or #BorisJohnson and would have made mincemeat of Foul Farage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like an emotional woman at the end of her tether.  #AmberRudd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's where #Remainers are going wrong. #Brexiteers ignore the law, lie, behave despicably from street thugs to politicians and spin-doctors. To get attention perhaps we need a little civil disobedience. Just enough to get government embarrassment and finally reports on #BBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We don't know what any #US #UK deal would be yet and how deeply we will be shafted  Oh for the protection of the #EU.  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexiterrs and their obsession with war! Modern life isn’t about standing in a trench shooting at people or jumping off boats to struggle up a beach. At least it hasn’t been since we’ve been part of #Europe. The war they keep referring to was thrust upon us we didn’t ask for it<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This evening (12th) the Pound is barely above parity with the Euro.  1 Pound is only worth 1.07701Euro.  By tomorrow a Pound may be worth less than a Euro. No government has ever allowed the Pound to tumble this way without taking action. What's going on? Who's benefiting?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's #UKIP's leader Dick Braine. Say no more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson is the incarnation of Mr Toad and he has reduced 10 Downing Street to Toad Hall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The country has suffered years of austerity and cuts to public services just so #BorisJohnson can have a pre-election spending spree.  Notice the amount of our money being released with great fanfares is far less than the amount slashed from our services.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, #JeremyCorbyn, fine words but what are you going to do about it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And #MargaretThatcher was pro-#Europe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Labour will be judged by what it does not what it says.  So far all we have had is empty rhetoric and meaningless aspirations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What on earth are you snorting??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remarks about the Queen Mother coming from a cigar puffing beer swiller #NigelFarage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I met Queen Mother at several events. Never saw her smoke, only had one drink all evening. #NigelFarage's caricature is a national insult. Royalist or not, if King and Queen were key in keeping #British morale going during the war, that woman was the strength behind the throne.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There was no mention of foul #Farage's offensive comments on #BBC TV News. Afraid of some backlash from #NigelFarage or just part of the BBC's #Brexit support?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So that's Jews, Blacks, Europeans, on #NigelFarage's hate list. If he gets more power there's plenty of other groups who had better watch out; the disabled, elderly, those with learning difficulties to name a few. #Remainers will be a prime target.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of an increasingly large group. #Brexit has certainly flushed out the politicians not so good at hiding their deceit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimonBruni If this were not just gross #Brexit stupidity, rubbing the people’s noses in the triumph of right-wing populism, do we need more 50p pieces in circulation?  In a world going cashless, where the main use of a 50p is in the machine to inflate tyres, why spend millions minting more?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre The anti-vaccination brigade is just delusiona, the sort of people who believe claimsmade on shopping channels;tragically it is their children who will suffer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre No doubt you will ignore this nonsense.  If there is a God #Brexit, #BorisJohnson, #Trump, #NigelFarage etc, proves he (or she) has given up on us; unless defeating it all is a perverse biblical challenge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the subject of anti-semitism in political parties, with #NigelFarage’s endorsement of the holocaust, at school singing ‘gas ‘em all’, how many Jews are there in the #Brexit party?  Are there any Jewish MEPs?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These are the same arguments put forward by the barmy #Brexiteers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A picture of core #Brexit supporters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Notice how all investigations into crooked activities of anyone on the #Leave side of #Brexit evaporate?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you support #Trump's policies and actions you are a racist by definition and accept right-wing nationalism, populism and sexual harassment<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Did anyone knowingly vote for this?  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HenryCPorter So far public demonstrations are ignored. It would take poll tax scale riots in many centres to get govmt to listen and #BBC to report it.

<|startoftext|>You have to include #LizTruss and she is not necessarily favourite in the moronic MP stakes.  Regrettably, the standard of politicians has sunk to a standard not seen since rotten boroughs and open polls.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is such arrogance. #EU didn't ask #UK to leave, the lied-to voters chose to make #Britain a foreign country. The UK spent 40 years helping create EU trading rules so the terms are well known. #BorisJohnson and his cronies blaming EU for British stupidity is just face saving<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holding out the bait to be coerced into staying with the #Tories. If you know the the party you are with lacks honesty and integrity, and is trying to implement harmful policies, just leave. You don’t need a holiday to decide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hear, hear!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would-be dictators always try to convince the media that their people love them. For example, Gaddafi used those exact words in a TV interview; when challenged about his actions he said “My people love me”. #BorisJohnson is well down the same road; at least in his head.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And it’s on the other side of the world. Maybe #LizTruss doesn’t know that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now she wants to hitch the #UK to #Trump’s America and accept what they dump on us.  #LizTruss just does not how the world works and what trade is all about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the stupid pseudo-politician who tried to whip up #Brexit enthusiasm because two thirds of our cheese is imported. That includes delicious Edam, Gouda, 1600 French cheeses, New Zealand cheese, Canadian cheese and so on, all with individual qualities.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Because #Labour is headed by an elderly rabbit caught in the headlights.  #JeremyCorbyn<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson and #Trump cooking-up a #US #UK trade deal - how much surplus US stuff does that mean we are going to have dumped on us and what will it cost us? How much of UK infrastructure do we have to hand over; starting with the NHS?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>As are we all.  Hope the problems getting medication post-#Brexit doesn't include anti-depressants. Suicide rate could rise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, right, like that's going to happen.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>down the food chain as he didn't go to Eton.  Could his appointment have anything to do with his "romantic interest" in Esther McVey. In Boris' view that could be qualification for expertise in equality and women.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Presumably appointing a man to be   Secretary of State for Women and Equalities is #BorisJohnson's version of equality.  Is #PhillipDavies the #Tory best equipped for the role? Or is it a case of giving jobs for the boys and this was the only one left for a crony but<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can get away with anything in #Britain as long as it's the right size.  Owe the bank £10 life's a misery, owe £10m the bank is in your hands.

<|startoftext|>Is this the first admission that #Brexit will lead the #UK into military conflict in #Europe?  Growing a new generation of cannon fodder to re-run past wars.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Typical #,#JeremyCorbyn; vacuous phrases and hollow aspirations.  We all aspire to world peace and fairer society, but a political leader has to stand up and fight, that means addressing everyday issues as well phylosophocal stuff such whether #UK has the means to defend itself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think you'll find #BorisJohnson's administration is more right-wing than they were<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We can look forward to Annunziata Rees-Mogg being brought in to beef-up the government’s right-wing loony credentials.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s a family matter. Just a terrorists are sometimes brothers, getting family involved means they are less likely to squeal on you if they get caught.  Pa Johnson will probably be appointed a paid adviser and sister could be the head Johnson media guru.  #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Much as the Thatcher cabinet was hated, by comparison they were true statesmen. One or two even ‘came good’, Michael Heseltine and Kenneth Clarke, for example<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The name for a gathering of the large black birds is a ‘parliament of rooks’.  Now we have a ‘government of crooks’.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We live in hope.  Unfortunately, like a virus, it will go into hiding then emerge more virulent and deadly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson revealed to the media something said by the Queen at their first meeting. The comment may have been trivial but content of  meetings between the Queen and Prime Minister are supposed to be confidential. Blabbermouth Boris starts from day one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThatTimWalker @BorisJohnson Oh no they haven't; they're just camouflaged.  We have an ersatz #Trump in #BorisJohnson, a backroom Hitler with #JacobReesMogg and there's the Mickey Mouse Mussolini, #NigelFarage. They may not all be in the government - yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A weak manager appoints people weaker than himself so he appears stronger and has someone to blame.  With #DominicRaab as Foreign Secretary what chance of release has Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe got now?  #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Delusional twaddle.  #JeremyCorbyn spouting nonsense again; if only he would listen.  Appropriate he is predicting the martyrdom of #Labour at a festival to celebrate martyrs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Snigger!  https://t.co/xmU4egJMBU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So now we know who to blame.  #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If only #LiamFox had had the consideration to do this three years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Caught a few seconds of #BBC over-load coverage of #BorisJohnson's accession and who were they interviewing? Nigel Farage of course.  Not a #UK MP, not part a main political group, self appointed head of a one policy party, national embarrasment, architect of national destruction<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This really is turning the clock back. We may be seeing a re-run of The Troubles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is Jeremy Clarkson in there?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the first time as Prime Minister #TheresaMay says something we can agree with.  #JeremyCorbyn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Change in #Tory Prime Ministers is due to their failures; no credit to #JeremyCorbyn.  If he were doing his job they would have gone sooner and perhaps #UK wouldn't be in the state it is in.  If he provided a credible alternative #TheresaMay might have lost her vanity election<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've never been involved in violence, never hit anyone nor used a weapon in anger, been told I'm too tolerant and forgiving; but there are some people who drive you to reach for a gun, or maybe a baseball bat.  #TobyYoung #Tories #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a tragedy - if the first female Chancellor were to be #LizTruss!  Having that incompetent #BorisJohnson sycophant in charge of #Britain’s finances would screw the country and set the equality agenda back decades. Surely there are many more capable women on the #Tory benches.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unfortunately people who voted for him knew that; just as voters in #US knew #Trump to be low-life.  It seems there comes a point where the collective madness prefers a candidate who reinforces their prejudices rather has any principles. That's what #Farage trades on, like Hitler<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And neither have you. In fact, by supporting #Brexit and not providing any form of opposition you have alienated #Labour voters, split the party and undermined Labour's position as a credible political force.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So we know whom to blame.  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now let's see how #BorisJohnson  pays back the people he is in hock to for backing and promotion, and which sycophants (arse lickers) get government jobs; all at our expense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson's win in the Prime Minister stakes just shows that when you think things just couldn't get any worse - they do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If that were the case it's no change then. #JeremyCorbyn has been colluding with the #Tories on #Brexit and providing no effective opposition on other policies that have harmed ordinary people and the country as a whole.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Labour running scared of losing all their support to the #LibDems.  #JeremyCorbyn continues his leadership into oblivion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And how will the treacherous #NigelFarage and his #Brexit Party respond to this? Turn their backs?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trumpy675 Looks suspiciously like #AnnWiddecombe speaking for the #Brexit Party. Given up science finding a 'cure' for homosexuality and relying on God.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No matter how many of #Tory cabinet quit another will pop up to take their place. Like toxic jelly babies spewing out of a poisonous sweet machine Competent ones resign, not to be linked to #BorisJohnson's administration, government works its way down to the bottom of the barrel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are two reasons for #BorisJohnson chosing a cabinet of incompetents:  It is easy to blame them when things go wrong. and As a weak manager he feels more in charge if the people around him are worse than he is.  No doubt #ChrisGrayling will have a senior position.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like the Rt Hon. Sir Alan Duncan is trying to be #BorisJohnson's Arse-licker-in-Chief<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You mean #BorisJohnson will trump #Trump? #NigelFarage certainly won't like that as he sees himself in that position; and #DonaldTrump will soon stir something up to make himself cock of the playground, 'make Trump great again'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh lord, another #JeremyCorbyn delusion. Doesn't he ever listen or read reports?  Does he actually believe his own publicity and just listen to devoted Corbynites?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No doubt if Chief Clown, #BorisJohnson, becomes Prime Minister he will have a new official car. It will be in bright multi-colours, have wobbly wheels, a smoking engine, and the doors will fall off when he arrives at 10 Clowning Street. Faithful retainer #LizTruss will be driving<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even arch gammon #AndrewNeil sees the current #Tory administration to be a disaster.  In his own words: "Quelle surprise"  Or, more accurately, in a good, descriptive #EU language words<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As far as we know the Moon has never had a sectarian war on it, isn't divided with a border between two nations, and doesn't have a tariff system for items taken to or from it.

<|startoftext|>@ThatTimWalker @BorisJohnson Politicians such as #BorisJohnson and #DonaldTrump ride on the wave of popular depression.  They trade on the mood of alienation and disengagement in some levels of society. They rely on the quantity who feel core politicians ignore them rather than the quality of their policies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThatTimWalker Shameful ‘accolade’ surely goes to #TheresaMay who, as a #Remainer, became PM knowing #Brexit would be a national disaster Difference between her and #BorisJohnson is May tried to soften  impact of jumping over the Brexit cliff where Boris doesn’t care as long as he gets the job<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nobody has said #BorisJohnson is good at anything; except, that is, for philandering, lying, clowning about, self-publicly, inciting hatred against the #EU, alienating politicians of worth, and so on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a basic technique of the devious; when they run out of argument or their case is flawed they criticise the  way the other party is speaking or try to undermine their credibility.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TerryReintke @grahambsi Even if the other members of the European Parliament and the people of #EU countries realise these aberrations are not #Britain; this behaviour and the actions of #BorisJohnson and other Faragist politicians are deeply shaming and a national disgrace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Government's Teflon-shouldering responsibility for TV licences for the elderly on to the #BBC was a calculated move not to show the #Tories as the nasty party again; and to place a financial burden on the national broadcaster in order to favour commercial providers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't shout too soon or the right-wing press and media trolls will start winding up the anti-#EU hype. Suddenly we'll be back to stories that every supermarket lorry is packed with illegal immigrants and lies about money sent to Brussels.  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this shock at the amount of work the #EU Parliament has to deal with the result of Acid Annie never having to earn a living before?  #AnnunziataReesMogg #Brexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In the unlikely event that this was a set-up and #DavidDavis fell for it then he has inadequate skills to be a representative for Britain at the negotiating table.  #Brexit really has shown how shabby many of the current crop of politicians are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can only appear a grinning, unprepared fool if you are an unprepared fool who is grinning.  #DavidDavis being photographed as a grinning fool shows how unprepared he is for anything - and a fool to boot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reminiscent of 1930's Nuremberg.

<|startoftext|>Beware the #Brexit Party. If America can vote for Trump the British may be fool enough to let #Farage in.  Every time #British politics hits rock bottom the low-life find a way of digging a deeper pit.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>More evidence of #JeremyCorbyn leading #Labour down the plug hole of history.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice to think that's true but history shows the public will follow a loud-mouth leader like sheep. Hitler got away with much the same.  Look at #Trump and #Farage.  'Trump and Farage', could be a pound shop department store or a firm of dodgy solicitors?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tabbiesrule Evidently illustrates the analogy. #JeremyCorbyn posing while coming up with ineffectual platitudes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JeremyCorbyn is the political equivalent of an old time Miss World hopeful, saying their wish is for world peace and free plastic surgery for all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s #JeremyCorbyn’s natural style, too little too late; the same on everything, #Brexit, anti-semitism, #Labour party squabbles, providing effective opposition.

<|startoftext|>And if a trades union needs to call a strike it has to get votes from 40% of those eligible to vote. #Brexit is being forced through on far less percentage than eligible to vote in the rigged #Referendum.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The logic is fine; unfortunately the same thing was said about Hitler and the Nazis.  #NigelFarage will keep inventing new fears to keep him going.

<|startoftext|>#JohnMajor is being more effective as a senior figure than he was as Prime Minister.  As PM at least he had integrity and statesmanship, qualities lacking in both of the current candidates, and at one of them could not even spell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson has been allowed to get this far to make the awful #JeremyHunt looks less dreadful.  We'll all be so relieved when Boris doesn't get elected.  It's fairly crude marketing by #Tory HQ.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What this says is 'Heck Food has just pain me a very large bung to promote their goods'. No doubt #BorisJohnson would like to see the sausages coated in sugar and served rare<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre There’s a rare medical condition called diphallus in which the male member divides in two.  Might account for #Boris’s indiscriminate fouling wherever he goes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like the #Brexit Party manifesto<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happily so many in #Europe are intelligent and educated to be fluent in English. They’ll be at such an advantage trading with the US, Canada, Australia, etc with tariffs agreements and communication skills.   Unfortunately isolationist Brits are so ignorant of foreign languages.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally, someone has taken the right action with #NigelFarage, pity someone let him out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A Slurry? A Cess Pit? A Rats’Nest?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a bit of a visual oxymoron.  While the choice is between two of the biggest political pr*cks, to graphically represent them as such panders to their already inflated egos.  #BorisJohnson #JeremyHunt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All true. And notice the model in the picture is left-hand drive.  Are these cars going to be built in the #UK to be sent to the #US. If they were intended for post-#Brexit #Europe they would be made in Europe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s the other way round.  #BorisJohnson’s behaviour explains why he was excluded from intelligence information while Foreign Secretary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds great. And where is the #Labour leader? All we hear from #JeremyCorbyn is airy-fairy aspirations about a better world and calls for a general election for him to lose.  If he cut loose from the dinosaurs and declared a strong #Remain, anti-#Brexit stance,Labour would surge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NigelFarage is totally wrong. #Brexit is his priority and obsession. For the majority stopping Brexit is the priority.  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>a standard of living many other nations envy.  #Britain has declined under the #Tories and has become toxic in some ways through the rise of the right-wing, both of which have divided us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is #BorisJohnson copying his hero Trump’s ‘Make America Great Again’. America was already great, not perfect maybe.  Now Boris is trying to undermine the #UK in the same way. As countries go it already is one of the best places in the world, not perfect but with freedoms and<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Typical #BorisJohnson distraction; pandering to the poorly paid vote by encouraging sugar consumption and claiming the ability to get food poisoning as a new freedom.  Then he has air-head groupies like #LizTruss getting excited at all his nonsense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexiteers should come clean when they say “we had a vote”: we had a RIGGED vote that #Leavers ceased on.  Even with all the lies and shenanigans the #Brexit majority was slim and less, as a percentage of eligible voters, than a public sector union would need to call a strike<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is wrong to judge people from their looks but, it has to be said, #AnnWiddecombe looks as mad as she acts. Should be a warning to us all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But #JeremyCorbyn is in a position to influence things from the top, or at least he would be if he was doing his job properly, instead of playing gardeners for photo opportunities at the allotments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perhaps we could start with sacking #JohnHumphreys.  Superannuated gammon who has used tenure of a daily national news broadcast to peddle the government line, promote #Brexit and attempt to ridicule non-#Tory MPs and anyone who opposes national suicide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When Thatcher’s #Tories started selling public assets, prior to privatisation, BT was softened-up by underfunding and restricted, the service became appalling. As soon as it was sold funding was put in and public duped into thinking it was better. Same is being done to the #NHS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those whose ancestors suffered slavery should be thoroughly offended at this insulting comparison.  #Brexit #StopBrexit #EU #AnnWiddecombe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe science will find a cure for #AnnWiddecombe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I too believe in #Brexit, at least that it exists; in the same way that rats, sewage, suicide, cancer, rape, poverty and homelessness exist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre And I bet, if she’s talking, every other word is ‘like’.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And #JeremyHunt is banging on about #BBC supporting pensioners' licences. This was a government responsibility Tefloned off to the BBC so the #Tories, the nasty party, wouldn't take the blame.  A cynical shirking of responsibility and promotion of commercial TV interests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vonderleyen @City_Livery_SM Hello and congratulations on your appointment. Apologies for the behaviour of some of the MEPs sent from Britain; they do not represent the majority. Here's to the demise of #Brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The weasel words are 'may be'. Somehow the government will quosh and investigation into their chums.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre Mix-up not surprising. #Tory leadership contenders looked like the Bash Street Kids. We are stuck with Biffo the Bear, #BorisJohnson, verses Roger the Dodger, #JeremyHunt. The government runs the country like the Beano. Then there is #JacobReesMogg, Lord Snooty, pulling strings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only in the job a day and #AnnunziataReesMogg looks haggard and overwhelmed.  Evidently bitten off more than she can chew and has probably been up all night filling in expenses claims.  Lord save us from #Brexiteers!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What with the #Brexit Party, #NigelFarage, #BorisJohnson, #LizTruss, #LiamFox, the rest of the #Tory top table, #JeremyCorbyn, #Labour #Brexiteers, #LenMcCluskey etc; is there no one in British politics that doesn't treat electorate as punters to be patronized and manipulated?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whatever your politics this childish display is a national disgrace.  On behalf of the rest of #Britain, #EU we apologise  #StopBrexit #Brexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@drdavidbull @brexitparty_uk No, you shouldn’t be in Strasbourg.  A narrow margin voted to leave the #EU and many of those have changed their minds.

If you desperately feel your home is with the Tories you could switch back if their policies get a reality fix<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good idea. Even for a dyed-in-the-wool #Tory you can see the current line-up of wannabe leaders are hopeless and dangerous.

<|startoftext|>#LenMcCluskey appears to have learned his politics and leadership style in Stalinist USSR.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Said it before; there is a whiff of the Gestapo about #JeremyHunt.  Not sure if he is as much controlled by the ERG and other behind-the-scenes forces as #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>They aren't costs to government or long-term benefits to individuals. Tax cuts for the wealthy are divisive and weaken society.  More spending power for the already well-heeled means more to spend on imported goods or to salt away in investments, taking cash out of circulation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh no he didn’t!  Another #BorisJohnson self-promoting lie.  It was ‘fuck Boris’; though that anyone would want to, even for money or a bet, defies belief<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is she Jewish?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson  Lied Lied Lied Lied Lied Lies Lies Lies Will lie Lie Lie  Pathological lying (also called pseudologia fantastica and mythomania) is a behavior of habitual or compulsive lying.  In Boris's case it is just a means of personal advancement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only thing #DavidCameron did with a smack of integrity was to resign. #TheresaMay has been a disaster; turn-coat incompetent. The current #Tory options are frightening. #JeremyCorbyn is less reliable than a Kit-Kat bridge. #LibDems look like statesmen and women by comparison<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And #BorisJohnson spent a fortune on water cannon to use against British citizens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Certainly did not feel angry enough to be an obsessive Tweeter.  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The notion of #Farage as a resentful outsider would explain his later behaviour; trying to destroy institutions and other people's lives, and seeking attention and support through underhand means.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did #NigelFarage leave Dulwich or was he thrown out (asked to leave)? In his time pupils quit at 16 because they couldn't manage A-levels, were suited to work in an intellectually less demanding field, were disruptive through identity/behaviour issues, or couldn't manage the fees<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#LizTruss totally unhinged on #BBCNewsnight. Have to admire her brass neck in blatantly avoiding giving a straight answer and promoting #BorisJohnson despite being presented with his own statements. Total economic fantasies despite being Chief Secretary to the Treasury.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre You are not alone and puerile is too kind a description<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As Mayor of London #BorisJohnson bought water cannon to use against British citizens on their own territory. The idea he would send tanks to Edinburgh is not unbelievable -  stupid, undemocratic, repressive and the actions of a fascist dictator; but for Boris not unbelievable.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>A lot of stuff #Tories have starved of cash, except tax cuts, of course. #BorisJohnson doesn’t have a plan of how he is going to play Captain Bountiful while cutting taxes.

<|startoftext|>The same #BorisJohnson who bought the water cannons at public expense to use against British citizens expressing their right to protest. Worthy of the right-wing dictatorship he is trying to head the #UK into. But then he is only the clowning face of far darker controllers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not only is that definitely an old picture, if it is #BorisJohnson at all, it was certainly not taken anywhere near  Camberwell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To avoid the country being destroyed the #UK needed support from the Empire countries and was finally bailed out by the #US.  It's about time this #Brexiteer nonsense was exposed as no reason to justify self -inflicted national harm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a prize example of gammon lunacy. We survived two world wars that were thrust upon us, we didn't vote to start them. Each cost millions of lives, bankrupted the country, brought rationing and hardship; and in both the country and its resources were exhausted.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Not actually free; we willingly share the cost so it is there when we need it. #NHS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was #BorisJohnson's throne-like seat chosen deliberately? Is he being marketed as a combined #Tory monarch and pope?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As the PM’s salary is far less than #BorisJohnson gets paid for writing for the right-wing press will he carry on with it?  For anyone else it would be a conflict of interest but in Boris’s spectrum of chicanery that’s too small a concern. He’s got to makeup the money somehow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Video shows Steve Bannon claiming he advised Boris Johnson on key speech   https://t.co/BLfswDeGJq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fiction becomes fact.  #BorisJohnson is the re-creation of Rick Mayall’s #Tory MP Alan B’Stard. Venal, lying, cheating, sexually predatory, obsessed with self, using his position to manipulate the police and avoid prosecution.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He is the comedy act that was put up against a bunch of openly repellent or just plain unelectable alternatives for #Tory leader<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson leadership is a facade.

<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson was always going to be PM. He’s the choice of red-neck populists and guard-my-wealth top #Tories.  The leadership contest is just a sham; like an HR department holding interviews because they have to be seen to, even though the winning candidate was already chosen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another election is no help without an effective alternative to the present government; with #JeremyCorbyn as #Labour leader there will be a dilution of votes, some to the #Brexit Party, and the #Tories will be in again only weaker.  The best outcome is a #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson is a two-timing, self-serving populist without principles stirring support in the maner of Trump and Farage. He tries to get credibility and gravitas by channelling Churchill but he is a fundamental fraud.  But #JeremyHunt has the whiff of the Gestapo about him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Certainly glad I was never under #BobStewart's command!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the public squabbling and backstabbing on TV between those who are supposed to be the country’s most senior management team is an example of their unity, cabinet meetings must be a total fiasco. #Boris will be the clown in charge of the circus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But #JeremyCorbyn’s comfortable in opposition. It’s his natural stance - standing on the sidelines throwing bricks. Problem is he’s no good at it. Couldn’t even score off Theresa May, the worst PM since Eden (the man, not garden of). Even #Boris will make mincemeat of him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JeremyCorbyn’s #Labour is committed to respecting the result of corruption, gerrymandering and manipulation. What a low point in political history.  Labour will remain an ineffective opposition until it changes leader and starts listening to its members and the public.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #BorisJohnson is ‘speaking his mind’ what sort of vile stew is in there? For someone whose supporters promote as having abilities and leadership skills he certainly gives the impression of being a shallow, shit-for-brains, self-serving populist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neilefawcett The #Tories are scraping the bottom of the political barrel so hard this time they will get splinters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #BorisJohnson had a Muslim great grandfather and he still peddles offensive attitudes it shows he never learns. Or he has even less regard for others than we thought.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson may have one friend in Bristol. How many does he have in Liverpool? He was forced to go there and publicly apologise for comments he made about Liverpudlians.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get this straight. TV licence issue was dumped on the #BBC by our #Tory government.  It is a toxic issue that the government knew would get really bad press. So they Tefloned it onto the BBC without any budget to cover the cost. BBC had no choice but is forced to look the bad guy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Simple, #BorisJohnson isn't worth supporting it's just that #MichaelGove, #JeremyHunt and #SajidJavid are even more repellent.   #RorySteward has a bit more credibility so if #Britain has to scrape the bottom of the barrel for a #PrimeMinister he is the least bad option<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not just #BorisJohnson: #Farage, #Gove etc; all liars, swindlers and snake oil salesmen. Blatant defrauding with impunity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And if gerrymandered #Brexit 'is being forced through as 'the will of the people' then there are no grounds for denying #Scotland independence if that is the genuine majority  will of Scottish people.  Sad loss of the Union but vote for Brexit get disintegrated Britain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A Freudian slip there. Getting #Brexit through means riding rough-shod over democracy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Headline grabbing side issue. Not trivial but not a key election issue. #BorisJohnson all show and no substance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Regrettably, #Tory policy is that every older person, with the exception of those rich enough to pay for private health and care homes, should die with dignity, respect AND QUICK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely right. A media circus of candidates for an election in which we have no vote. Perhaps it’s just so the dark forces making the choice can judge from public reaction which of the toxic line-up will be least repellent. #Tories<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson or whichever hopeful gets PM, and face it, he’s the gammons’ favourite, will trigger an election as #Labour has no credibility with #JeremyCorbyn in charge. Corbyn is #Tories’ best guarantee of another period in office. Voters will fight shy of policyless #Farage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just wait a bit post-#Brexit and we’ll find out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me neither. #JeremyCorbyn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The great British public will vote for the person who makes most noise. #BorisJohnson knows that well, so he's courted publicity his whole career, no matter how ridiculous looks, how controversial or offensive. As long as his name is in headlines. His mate #Farage does the same<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The US is ragingly right-wing enough to elect the ‘Pest from the West’, #DonaldTrump now we have the Mickey Mouse version #BorisJohnson. Just shows policy and statesmanship mean nothing; publicity and popularity are all that counts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mind altering substances have this effect.  #MichaelGove #NHS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Try fighting to #StopBrexit altogether.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Working for a government department you would be security vetted before being allowed access to highly classified material. Drugs use, past or present, would bar you from those jobs.

<|startoftext|>As a former #Labour voter I’m sick of #JeremyCorbyn, the #Tories’ best asset<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It puts more pressure and control on the #BBC and helps commercial TV suppliers at public expense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Removal of TV license from elderly is a blatant piece of #Tory chicanery; jaw droppingly obvious.

<|startoftext|>#Brexiteers keep banking on about a ‘deal’, #TheresaMay’s deal, renegotiated deal, #Labour fantasy deal, nobody says what the deal is. Even if there were a return to democracy with a #PeoplesVote whether to #Remain or #Leave; we would not know the terms for this national suicide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just shows #Tory MPs are like Irish stew - the scum rises to the top.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A key benefit of being in the #EU - maybe a lot of ‘jaw jaw’ but no war war.  #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre Using it or is one?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's #JeremyCorbyn that is keeping the #Tories in power. He's their secret propaganda weapon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These days just confessing to being #Tory, at least a Tory MP, is a cover-all for any low life, illegal or immoral activity. Having plenty of dodgy doings In your secret CV is an essential qualification for a senior post. Gives credence to the story of Cameron and the pig's head.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's why the #BBC asked her on; to undermine the #Greens credibility. A rational speaker wouldn't have reinforced the BBC bias for #Brexit and sucking up to the government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Part of the race for expensively educated #Tory boys to get street cred - to look as if they know what it's like "down in the 'hood". Appears the effects haven't worn off. Shows they could afford drugs and started consorting with dealers and criminals early; old habits die hard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson prosecution dropped on a legal technicality. Always knew he would ooze out from under this one.  Doesn't stop him being a liar and a self-serving manipulator.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Regrettably, like most damaging organisms, if beaten they tend to go to ground then re-emerge as something worse.  #Tory<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tragically the #Tory hopefuls are mostly looking so extreme and bizarre they are making the egregious #BorisJohnson look moderate. That's how low we've sunk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's the future for post-#Brexit post-#NHS #Britain. In #Tory healthcare you pay, if you can afford to, for every breath you take.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Fans_of_Gerard What's strange about it? That's the point of social media - it's social, involves lots of people. Or are you embarrased by your responses? If you would rather communicate by letter you should say so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In a rare moment of balanced reporting, the #BBC reporter this morning pointed out that #Trump is a master of social media manipulation; he makes these inflammatory tweets as a distraction from issues such as US takeover of the #UK economy,  especially the #NHS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump thrives on opposition to his presence.

<|startoftext|>Judas Grease-Smogg  #JacobReesMogg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So #JeremyCorbyn is still ignoring the bulk of #Labour members who want to #Remain or at least have a #PeoplesVote.  #Corbyn is called a Marxist but he styled his leadership on Stalin.  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Judas Grease-Smogg is furious; great, pile on the prosecutions.  Perhaps someone will get to him in turn; though his defence will be able to out-fund any prosecution.  #JacobReesMogg #StopBrexit  #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a good point. If there is a successful prosecution of #BorisJohnson it will start a domino fall of the other #Brexit liars.  More reason for skulduggery from those in power to subvert prosecution.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This would be bad news for anyone else but for #BorisJohnson there's no such thing as bad publicity. He will oil out from under this one somehow. Unless his career plan is to form a trio with Jonathan Aitkin and Jeffrey Archer. The #Tory ex-con comedy act.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>More #JacobReesMogg lies.  As a %age of spending, food and clothing are cheaper than ever.

<|startoftext|>Now all #JeremyCorbyn has to do is declare #Remain as party policy and #Labour’s fortunes will start to improve straight away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No doubt #TheresaMay hung on to the job long enough to qualify for the PM’s pension.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or is this to be the future where all parties get to select their leaders etc as TV soap opera?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is #Tory party leadership being debated as public spectacle?

<|startoftext|>Great party???? In the days of Disraeli perhaps.  And even then the 'greatness' was based on keeping politicians' actions behind closed doors.  #Tory<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quite right. History will be much kinder to #TonyBlair than current media and #Labour spokespeople.  He's an easy target and distraction for Corbynites.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And, unlike the current mob, Alastair Campbell was good at his job.  #Labour #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As with Kate Hoey's support for Nigel Farage???? Fudged foggy policies and dual standards; that's #Labour under #JeremyCorbyn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BBC has become a one party support service promoting a single side to #UK's greatest political issue for decades.

<|startoftext|>And not just Fire Services. So many have suffered and died because of #Tory service underfunding and tax cuts for the rich, aka 'austerity'.

<|startoftext|>True, and he's a cunning, conniving, self-promoting back-stabber. Trouble is #BorisJohnson is the sort of populist Farage fans will follow; he's probably banking on an allegiance transfer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Regrettably the people #JeremyCorbyn has seen off have been Prime Ministers where he's still ineffective leader of an ineffective opposition. No matter how bad #Tories, are or whichever awful leader they choose, #Labour will not get into power with Corbyn as leader. Sad, sad, sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh Lord! #TheresaMay is dire but look at the alternatives! Not a statesman/woman among them; all self-serving #Brexit obsessives.  #Labour doesn’t offer a decent alternative at the moment either. What a state the #UK is in; and post Brexit it could be a no longer united.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But they are not hampered by having #JeremyCorbyn dragging them down.  #Labour #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The poor will certainly suffer and the not so poor will be worse off. In fact we will all be the losers in so many ways if #Brexit goes ahead; except the very rich, they seem to be pretty smug about something.  #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No matter how guilty we know he will wriggle out of being prosecuted.  #BorisJohnson #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has an unfortunate resemblance to a bum crack. Maybe it was a #JacobReesMogg self portrait<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And when the #BBC announced British Steel disaster, the fact that the problem was mainly due to lack of sales because customers did not know what tariffs they would have to pay in post-#Brexit world, it was mentioned as just a passing remark.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NigelFarage #JacobReesMogg et al couldn't have planned it better.  #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Odd how this is announced just before #EU elections. #BBCNEWS headlined #BritishSteel having to pay EU environmental charge as if it were a surprise and looking after the planet is a wicked imposition. Then government says EU rules prevent a bailout, didn't apply before, e.g. RBS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>According to #BBCNews #BritishSteel report first of its problems is having to pay #EU environmental charges which they thought they'd swerve because of #Brexit, oh and by the way, its customers have stopped buying because they don't know tariffs they have to pay outside the #EU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Having said that, this is not behaviour normally to be condoned at all but #Farage brings out the worst in everyone, supporters and opponents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No doubt #NigelFarage’s #Brexit thugs dealt with the protester in their own way or will inflict revenge when they get the chance.  Three cheers for the milkshake thrower!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BBCRadioLondon Vanessa Feltz show talking about the 'Nigel Farage milkshake'. Does not sound ironic so it must be an endorsement.  More #BBC bias?  #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AustinEdwards76 Well done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whitewash in two weeks then!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the #BBC is in there somewhere.  Orwell's dystopian society included a machine for churning out anodyne  twaddle at the government's instruction to distract the masses. BBC to a 't' these days.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And the #EU is prosperity   #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #Tories are standing back and letting #NigelFarage do their 'destroy the #EU' work for them.  #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And so it should be  If #JeremyCorbyn refuses to listen to his own party members and continues to back #Brexit #Labour deserves to be slaughtered for appointing him.  Tragedy is the apalling #Farage will benefit from drifting Labour vote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #US has its #Trump and we have #Johnson, our chump.  Trouble is both appeal to the same populist reactionary core.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#UK &amp; #US history’s peppered with statesman and honourable politicians. How did we descend to the current state?  Roosevelt, Kennedy, Churchill, Bevan, and many more, not saints but worthy national figures. Now we have #Trump, #Johnson, #Corbyn, #Farage and a self-serving troupe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NigelFarage got elected to #EU  so he could become the worm that starts the rot. On that basis I should get taken on as a #Brexit party candidate to do the same to it.

<|startoftext|>They are certainly giving the poisonous Farage an easy run; looks as if they pressured the #BBC to give him support at public expense.  #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And desperately trying to avoid financial declarations under new #EU rules.  #JacobReesMogg #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Very good, Clive, we all agree, but do you support a #PeoplesVote and remaining in the #EU?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Regrettably, #JeremyCorbyn, with you as leader and #Labour not backing #remain or at least a #PeoplesVote there won’t be a Labour government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just ignore the rest of us and those who changed their minds; not to mention the will of his own party<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #Tories are scraping the bottom of the barrel so hard they’ve got splinters. #EstherMcVey is another one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NigelFarage again!!! What hold does he have over the #BBC?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The baby was healthy and the mother's doing fine. What does the rest matter?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BBC investigates Government capitulation to rich press barons by closing down the #Leveson inquiry   https://t.co/kCigJlOtXS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Proud to be so! Dark, light, any colour, hue, shade or level of illumination, doesn't matter as long as it can #StopBrexit .  #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've had this #BT scam, plus incessant nuisance calls from #TalkTalk. Stopped picking up the phone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And so say all of us! Trouble is, with this government, they wouldn’t spend it on the #NHS, it would go in tax cuts for the wealthy while the health service is starved to a standstill, softened up for privatisation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perhaps #TheresaMay is working on the fact she told #Tories she would resign once #Brexit was done. When we finally get a #PeoplesVote and this madness is cancelled she won't feel obliged to quit and will continue clinging on to the job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How can #Labour claim to be able to bring the country together when it can't even get itself together?  Ditching devisive #JeremyCorbyn would be a start.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You trusted #TheresaMay before????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only way to get people to back @Labour is for the party to ensure a @PeoplesVote, or better still, back #Remain.  Labour in its current state is just fudging and backing #TheresaMay.  Vote Labour get #Brexit and #Tory<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For anyone else this kind of delusional behaviour would be a key signal for mental breakdown or dementia. Why is it tolerated from #TheresaMay and why do we have someone with this sort of condition in the top job with our future in her hands?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hopefully those who have died or are no longer capable have been replaced as voters by young people with more grasp of the future than the old reactionaries trying to recreate a myth of the past.  #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit obsessives realise the public has shifted to #Remain. If they allow a #PeoplesVote they are bound to lose. Similarly, if the fudging about is allowed to continue  they may be overtaken by a groundswell shift, hence the drive to push #UK over the cliff while they can<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Prat!!  #JeremyCorbyn #Labour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The troubles, inequality, structural breakdown, poor wages, exploitation, political duplicity, etc, etc, of Trump’s America are the mirror of #Tory Britain. #TheresaMay and her cabinet must be using Trump as a model and guide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or just cancel #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Despite huge shift towards #Remain parties #TheresaMay is claiming election result is a message from the people to get on with #Brexit.  The woman is either delusional, living on another planet, or totally in the hands of hard-right #Brexiteers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drphiliplee1 Yes, but in a two person household only one has arrived<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry @tom_watson, declare #Labour for #Remain, or at least a #PeoplesVote in all circumstances with Remain as an option, and you might stand a chance. Fully agree #Tory destruction of social structure and #NHS has to be halted. Labour is alienating the support it needs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GavinWilliamson - over-promoted and easy target; sacking deflects criticism from #ChrisGrayling and others.  If Williamson is guilty he should be prosecuted; anyone else would be. If innocent he should sue for defamation.  No prosecution = fudge No suing = admission of guilt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not just the young! We are all being robbed by #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe sacking #GavinWilliamson was #TheresaMay’s way of telling #ChrisGrayling to get his act together.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the most ridiculous ministers ever??.............tough competition with #ChrisGrayling still in the cabinet.  #TheresaMay is conducting a ‘race to the bottom’ administration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In emergency a swift kick may suffice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Recipient of this procedure is usually referred to as a ‘mugwump’ -mug on one side, wump on the other (Churchill)  Usually corrected by pailingectomy, removal of fence parts from a total arse. Condition normally corrects itself when mugwump is faced with stark reality/desperation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is stupid. #JeremyCorbyn is trying to force an election while alienating people likely to vote #Labour. He's setting himself up to lose and possibly damage his party irrevocably. If he came out for #Remain or even just a #PeoplesVote as a fundamental he would pick up support<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BBC biased against #Brexit???!!!  A statement that could only have been made by someone/something so far to the right of the Brexit scale it's in the Nazis zone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shouldn't that be Farage already neck and neck with #Labour?  Labour should be miles ahead; if it backed a #PeoplesVote and #Remain it would be  #Farage has no policies other than national destruction. He just knows how to drum up support better than #JeremyCorbyn or #TheresaMay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why bother? #JohnRhysDavis has shown the face of a true #Brexit believer; a dyed-in-the-wool, right-wing, intolerant gammon.  Fortunately, #CarolineLucas has more intelligence and integrity; and can calmly look after herself. She's better off without a hollow apology.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The underlying plan is to undermine the #NHS until it is so bad the public will want privatised (ie for profit) medicine.  The #Tory mantra ' where there's pain there's gain'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes - and the change has to be followed by a #PeoplesVote.   #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only downside of #TheresaMay's departure is the fear of which #Brexit opportunist will rush in to fill the vacuum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this a ploy to bring over a #Brexit zealot to up #TheresaMay’s game?  Letting #Trump in is like attracting a vulture before the corps is dead.  #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scientists have managed to reactivate cells in the brain of a slaughtered pig; maybe #TheresaMay hopes to use the same technique with #Brexit.  What Lord Ashcroft might call the ‘Cameron Method’<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Says the wealthy, well set-up, self-interested Chris Tarrant.  #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, the #UK shares so much with #Europe; even down to rubbish rail services. Unless Europe has shaped its services on the British model.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #BBC has always been the broadcasting gold standard. Unfortunately  the news service has become a right-wing/government propaganda unit; whether by design, staffing #BBCNews with hardliners, or blackmailing the BBC with the licence fee.

<|startoftext|>Great, he'd have my vote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the Russian government interfered with the #Brexit referendum; shouldn't the #BBC be banging the drum about that and how our democracy has been compromised?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #Brexit effect is biting already. Vision of the future<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vjl2 The hard core Remainers will vote, it’s the peripheral voters who have ‘getting your backside off the couch’ problem when it comes to elections that are worrying. Really hope your faith in common sense is justified.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congratulations. However the fear is #Remainers will show typically British apathy towards #EU elections where the #Brexit and fascist zealots will rush to the polls.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please don't let it be true!  #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Regrettably the referendum result and growth of #NigelFarage and his succession parties shows that they are.  People will always believe lies that say what they want to hear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Certainly haven't fixed the potholes in the #Tory run boroughs that I know of. Is this a lie or just the political la-la land that disengaged MPs inhabit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If he's right #NigelFarage is a detail.  In reality, the most he will amount to is a footnote in history, and a very small footnote at that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Cripes!! Thought #BBC ignorance about #Europe was only around the #EU and #Brexit. Not only have they got the wrong cathedral; their own news reports show Notre Dame is on a flat island.  #BBCNews has managed to add stupidity to bias.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If only we had the national integrity to apply the same to #Brexit liars and right-wing media manipulators including #BBCNews.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unless #NigelFarage and the #Brexit Party manage to get into power the same way as the Nazis a century ago; a minority party that grabbed power through voter apathy  and disillusionment with the mainstream.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All predictions of impending #Tory demise are suspicious. Too early to forecast voting for an election that hasn't been called. More like horror stories to wake up the faithful.

<|startoftext|>Notable that this rubbish is coming from #IainDuncanSmith, one of the worst #Tory leaders of modern times, who was voted out of position by his own MPs.  He is either deluded or an outright lier.  #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote #IDS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If this had been #BBC London based news they would have gathered the few to look like a crowd or even CGI’d some extras.  Looks as if BBC Coventry is more honest; maybe it’s the distance from Westminster.  #BBCNews #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is it with #Brexiteers and buses?   Is it just just a convenient billboard for lies or an unfulfilled childhood urge to drive a public service vehicle?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>'Turd' isn't a fair description of #LiamFox; a turd eventually rots down to useful manure. Liam Fox started rotten and is no use for anything.  #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not just Freedom of Movement; most of us realise the overall benefit of being European and part of a greater community, not to mention how the #UK has prospered since being in the #EU.  #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah - but the #BBC can no longer be trusted.  Is Auntie using this to back national ‘no deal’ suicide or a proper extension for a #PeoplesVote?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And, like increased street crime and lack of investigation of other crimes, the government will deny that cutting police budgets has anything to do with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre The polarisation, societal and geographic, exposed by #Brexit are the stuff that lead to civil wars.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump, like the #Brexit promoters, trade on the lowest motives in society.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No problem with that. London could become a separate state. Make the M25 the border, easier to manage than the irregularity of the Irish border. Only downside is London would prosper in the #EU and #Brexit areas would struggle increasing North/South resentment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really good analogy but where is @TheresaMay? Mrs ???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hurrah!! Maybe daylight is dawning on the great British people #TheresaMay keeps siting every time she wants to peddle the outcome of the phoney #referendum<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I confirm I will not vote for @UKLabour unless it achieves a #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NigelFarage  #MichaelGove  #LiamFox  #JacobReesMogg aka Jacob Grease-Mogg aka Grease-my-palm-Mogg  #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He could but would he? Can't trust #JeremyCorbyn to follow party members wishes. #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Labour became unelectable when #JeremyCorbyn was appointed leader. Colluding with #TheresaMay on #Brexit will pull the credibility party completely. Any agreement must be conditional on a #PeoplesVote with the option of #Remain, the May/Corbyn mash-up, or No Deal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unfortunately she may be right.  #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And then blame #JeremyCorbyn and #Labour when it all goes belly-up. #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you sure it wasn't just a copy of the Daily Mail?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hate #TheresaMay but even more concerned about the dark forces that may replace her.  #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Better than that - #StopBrexit altogether. Keep the pressure on for a #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Notice #TheresaMay included the weasel get out - if negotiations fail it's down to the opposition.  #PeopleVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me too  #JeremyCorbyn #Labour #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shouldn't that read a Vote Leave investigation wouldn't be in in private interest. 'Public interest' seems to be a thing of the past; just a concept the elite in power use when they want to promote or deny something.  #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks as if the 'return to Victorian values' kicked off by David Cameron has started to work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh Lord help us!! If the #Tory party scrapes the bottom of the barrel this hard it will get splinters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So reminiscent of the rise of the Nazis. "Those who do not learn from fistory are doomed to repeat It."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But nowhere near as many as were on the pro-#EU #PeoplesVote March last week.  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just found a word, thanks to Oxford Dictionary ‘Word of the Day’ service, that could have been coined for #TheresaMay and her administration:  Kakistocracy ‘Government by the least suitable or competent citizens of a state’   https://t.co/JCsozmAIEC  #Tories #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good news (if having to police an example of one of the vilest and shameful elements of British society can be considered good).  Only 5??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the main organisers of today’s protest, Aaron Brown, appears to have links to far-right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First time the #DUP seems have some sense #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BBC News showing clips of the usual old fools spouting jingoistic nonsense when they should know better. Just ask them if they still have enough brain function to remember the state the #UK was in before we joined the #EU and whether they know what #Brexit has cost and will cost<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely right; and the same older generation should be able to remember the rubbish state the #UK was in before we joined the #EU. Stupid, misguided, jingoistic betrayal of younger people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hurrah!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank God (or goodness or  Aneurin Bevan) for the #NHS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Peter Bone-Head perhaps<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This stupidity seems to be a Cornish characteristic, which is unfortunate given the lovely nature of the county. They voted Leave even though Cornwall receives 10% more from the #EU than it pays in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or bring #JacobReesMogg onshore so he pays tax on his money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How about:  'I Did it My Way - and Failed' Or 'Chronicles of Wasted Time'  (though Malcolm Muggerage has already used it) Or '#Brexit- My Exit'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only time you'll see #NigelFarage not telling lies - his lips aren't moving!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lifeistoff Fully agree, that's why solution should be to address the North/South difference; not shoot ourselves in the foot with economic and social suicide. Similarly with #EU. If there are elements you don't like correct them from within.  No point having a tantrum and turning your back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Risk is people in their constituencies may vote for low life politicians; either because they chose party regardless of the quality of candidate, or value vile self-interest over national need. Chris Grayling is a prize example. Incompetent but in a blindly #Tory constituency<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lifeistoff There was no control applied. Powers that were there, still are there, have been ignored leading to the impression that the UK is sinking under a tide of immigration. Food for the xenophobes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not so much made of tin but having feet of clay. Not to mention cloth ears and a wooden heart.  #TheresaMay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is a measure of the egregious nature of #TheresaMay as Prime Minister that even she recognises the government’s standing would be improved by her just leaving it.  #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheresaMay, #UK's Titanic Prime Minister. Sets out on her first voyage in the top job, all bluster, fanfares, and extravagant claims. Refuses to look out, listen or change course; then hits the deadly #Brexit iceberg, sinks the ship and brings disaster to the passengers and crew<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who's pulling #TheresaMay's strings? #JacobReesMogg? #ERG? Another dark force?  Are #Tory grantees forcing her to stay because they haven't got a vaguely acceptable or competent replacement? Or is she just too bloody minded to give way?  Does length in office enhance her pension?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexiteers do not understand the difference between Freedom of Movement and illegal immigration hence #Referendum result. As an #EU member we have controls over immigration that governments have chosen not to use; that led to the xenophobic reaction.  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ken Clarke for #Tory party leader! If the #Tories have to exist they should be led by someone with a degree of integrity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just as poverty is a different kind of wealth, waiting for hospital treatment is a different kind of health care, and clinging on to office when you have lost all authority and support is a different kind of statesmanship. '#StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We can only hope, as those who saved the nation from #Brexit are rewarded, those who caused and tried to implement it are punished. #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#UK careers towards disaster and #Brexit has ruined many careers.  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They didn't ask the Queen to change her pro-#EU hat. Not so easily coerced no doubt.  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes! Yes! Yes! Revoke Article 50 must be the default option. #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or just a mess!  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And #JacobReesMogg has forgotten the other deal - no #Brexit   #PoliticsLive #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like a deposed despotic dictator claiming he still has the love of his people. Must have learned the technique from Col. Gaddafi and Saddam Hussein.  #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She must mean #Labour has to be a party to leave us with the best possible deal, the one we already have, and #Remain in the #EU. #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All you say is true but this fiasco started because David Cameron called a #Referendum to stop red-neck #Tories defecting to UKIP. All down to the shit stirring of the unspeakable #NigelFarage. Problem was Cameron didn't think so many people would be dumb enough to fall for lies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I used to admire #Jaguar cars, a dream purchase; now I know #JacobReesMogg owns one the whole brand is tainted.  Sounds petty but #Brexit fouls all British business. Certainly wouldn't buy anything made by the appalling #Dyson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's the plan: 1. Revoke Article 50 2. Extend the tenure of existing #UK MEPs until in/out decided 3. Hold second referendum 4. If #Remain the nonsense stops overnight (hurrah!) 5. If Leave (😱) formulate a plan all agree 6. Re-trigger Article 50  #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Back in the day I hated Michael Heseltine and his part in Thatcher’s government. Now he has more statesman qualities than the whole of the government. Has he improved or has the level of British politics decayed so much that anyone with decency and principles looks like a Hero?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NicolaSturgeon would be a far better Prime Minister than #TheresaMay or #JeremyCorbyn, or most of the #Tory and #Labour front runners. #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JeremyCorbyn - As appalling as #TheresaMay. Ignoring voter wishes, national interest and, in his case, the stated wish of his party. Not only has his appointment as leader made #Labour unelectable his stance on #Brexit makes the party hostile to #Britain's future #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit needs a full and ruthless investigation; every player, funder, propagandist, everyone. #BBC news and current affairs staffing and who appointed them needs serious scrutiny. So many #Tory activists and right-wing media pros; just look them up on Wikipedia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least the #BBC finally admitted the number.  Earlier reports said 'hundreds of thousands of people',  'organisers said it was a million' and 'police would not confirm numbers'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3. The referendum was based on lies, prejudice and xenophobia.  #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the area of the march around me there were plenty of party banners and placards, #Labour #LibDem and #Tory, along with hundreds of handmade ones with witty, perceptive and heart-felt messages. #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FinboBen @DrRosena @peoplesvote_uk Absolutely! Looking forward to meeting but would be happy to be overwhelmed by the crowd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FinboBen @DrRosena @peoplesvote_uk Hopefully there will be too many people to guarantee meeting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheresaMay is too bloody minded to give up the top job before she has to and her husband is a #Tory party activist with known #Brexiteer tendencies so is unlikely to try to get the egregious PM own up to her failure #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Knew the petition website crash was a fix.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The petition website 'crashed' when it got to 1,000,000 signatures; is it rigged to stop at a certain number?  Like everthing else in #Brexit is it fixed so #TheresaMay can crash on regardless?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice analogy. Only difference is that, in the films at least, Frankenstein's monster retained a thread of humanity that is missing from #NigelFarage.  Farage is just a self-obsessed imitation Mussolini.  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why are votes on #TheresaMay’s obsessive fudge arrangements called ‘meaningful’? That presumes all other votes are meaningless.  Is that the logic that grabs the result of the gerrymandered #Referendum by tagging it ‘meaningful’ but claiming a #PeoplesVote would be meaningless?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perhaps #JeremyCorbyn walked out because he realised #ChukaUmunna has the leadership qualities that he lacks.  Or maybe #Corbyn is right, only ‘proper party leaders’ should have been at the meeting, so he left.  #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This presumes #TheresaMay ever had 'it'. She put herself up for the top job for which she has no capacity, skills, or support. Just keeping the seat warm because other potential  candidates were even more appalling. No doubt she thought the flak was worth it for getting to 'Dame'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There must be a legal route to remove #TheresaMay from her post for CAUSING a national emergency. Better be sure the job won’t go to someone even worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe they come up to Owen Paterson on the train and tell him to ‘just get under it’.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trouble is, instead of being put in prison, the ones who shafted us will get peerages etc and John Bercow will be pilloried by the Tory press.  #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pantomime bloated capitalist!  #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darrengrimes_ You're facing bankruptcy through backing #Brexit - got what you asked for We're all going to be hit and poorer because of this madness; you've the bragging rights of being an early adopter Don't expect sympathy for your stupidity. Maybe #JacobReesMogg will bail you out - unlikely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is hope for us all!  #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Word missing. Should read: ‘Not only are they inflicting this disaster on the young, they should realise what leaving will do to the spending power of their pensions, food prices for a start.’  Anger makes you careless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the stupid old gammons should be able to remember the terrible state #UK was in before we joined #EU. I certainly do. Not are they inflicting this disaster on the young, they should realise what leaving will do to the spending power of their pensions, food prices for a start<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be careful what you wish for.  #TheresaMay #Tories<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>21st Century version of a Nazi stormtrooper.  #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If we do not decide our own laws what are we paying the 650 squabbling MPs and 785 in the House of Lords for?  The idea that we have no control over our own laws is just another #Brexiteer ‘side of a bus’ lie. But then #Brexit is founded on so many lies they just merge into one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CliveEfford As one of your constituents, I hope you vote/voted for a second referendum. If not, sorry, that's my vote lost forever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Tory and #Labour, what a shit shower. Never believed British politics could sink this low.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm with the good guys - for a #Referendum  #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NigelFarage is in the European Parliament because the great British people #TheresaMay keeps quoting couldn't be bothered to get off its collective backside and vote for someone better. And someone better wouldn't be hard to find.  #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nor do the majority in England, Wales and Northern Ireland!  We have been deprived of a vote to prove it. #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nor do the majority in England, Wales and Northern Ireland!  We have been deprived of a vote to prove it. #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #EU has no intention to 'punish' #UK; we're doing that to ourselves. They are acting like a responsible parent watching a naughty child writhing on the floor in a tantrum because it can't get it's own way. Just waiting for #Brexit to run out of steam. #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Radio news keeps wedging in that #TheresaMay lost the vote last night “which is not binding”.  Is the #Brexiteer element of government indicating the current deal or no deal being steamrollered through regardless?  If the vote is not binding what was the point of it? #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice thought but #TheresaMay’s latest failure doesn’t mean we’ll get Article 50 delayed and a #PeoplesVote. On past actions, with her determination to hang on to office (without power) and fear of ERG, the current offer may be rehashed, and too many MPs have feet of clay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least he is not blowing a mist of saliva over a cake the rest of his team will eat. More sensible than it looks - on the other hand, he may be just odd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Terrible as #TheresaMay is, she is keeping something worse out of the PM slot. Her incompetence might have saved #UK from #Brexit and has  kept #Boris or a #JacobReesMogg puppet from doing more damage. We have to be careful what we wish for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fingers crossed!   Ending #Brexit -national salvation. Getting rid of #TheresaMay - blot wiped off #UK politics.  Only danger is the vacuum caused by her removal may suck in something very nasty lurking in the wings.  #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yessssss!  #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just realised why #Brexiteers focus on bananas- they wear yellow jackets  #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has anyone ever seen a straight banana? #EU or no EU bananas curl and apples are round.  Under the EU food has to be produced to meet certain standards, which benefits all of us; changing the fundamental genetics of nature isn’t part of the deal. Just more #Brexiteer twaddle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Deal or no deal - all forms of #Brexit are a disaster.  #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely right. We need proper #police funding to prevent, investigate and prosecute knife crime, plus all the other crimes that no longer get necessary attention. Policing isn't the only answer; proper funding of youth and social services is also key as is effective parenting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#UK graphene research received £23 million funding from #EU European Regional Development Fund. #Brexit will cut #UK off from this support and all projects like it.  Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!  #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paullewismoney Which one did you switch to? I want to do the same but can't sort out which.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheresaMay believes MPs from towns she is trying to buy support from can be bought like the DUP Buying votes is a step back to corrupt times and it’s worse as it now openly regards political support as a commodity If towns need investment the money should have been spent already<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a state we've reached when these crusty old dinosaurs are dictating national policy or trying to. Equally despicable as the ERG.  #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit is the emblem of the ‘post-truth’ society we have become. Facts and morality are of no value; the effect, not truth, of the message is all that matters. That’s #Trump’s winning card  If you tell a big enough lie and tell it frequently enough, it will be believed - Hitler<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kier_Starmer just cut the crap and deliver the promise made at #Labour conference to support a #PeoplesVote? Or are promises made under #JeremyCorbyn not worth the hot air they float on?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here’s a pleasant daydream: #Brexit halted; #PeoplesVote decides #Remain; #JacobReesMogg quits the #UK for ever to be with his money. Then the #Brexiteer campaign, funding, lies, media bias, everything, is openly investigated and the culpable prosecuted. But this is #Tory Britain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scrutinise everything #JeremyCorbyn says and actually DOES.  If there is no #PeopleVote with #Remain as an option maybe the ‘quiet majority’ should riot; perhaps in #EU blue vests?  If #Brexit thugs get attention and scare #TheresaMay with those tactics it could be the way to go<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now we know why Sir James Dyson is so pro-#Brexit. Nothing to do with economics, exploitation or being able to lower safety and environmental standards; it’s just because he thinks he’s been cheated by the Germans.  https://t.co/eEvAO6LPdE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And those of us who were led to believe #Labour was for remaining in the #EU have abandoned it too.  #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are ‘grassroots’ #Tories: they own country estates, properties with paddocks, green fields and big houses with gardens. There are working class cap-doffing Tories who think them toffs are the natural people to run the country; and old duffers who don’t like foreigners<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have suffered the two worst leaders since Chamberlain in succession on one side and concurrently have the worst opposition leader ever on the other  British politics has gone from being the ‘mother of parliaments’ to an international laughingstock over one issue. #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the #Referendum was the “largest democratic exercise in this country’s history” then democracy is a fraud and the #UK public are considered just punters who can be sold any snake oil.  It was no bigger than any general election nor the one that took us into #Europe #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JacobReesMogg was being characteristicly ambiguous. By 'cheaper' food he meant lower quality, produced without controls or standards, and with no regard for environmental protection. But what's the problem with a little salmonella? A small price to pay for 'taking back control'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's it! Six months 'gardening leave'; or in #JeremyCorbyn's case 'allotment leave.  Get him out of the way and let #Labour breath 21st century air again.  #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Serves them right.  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What makes me furious about these old fools is they, like me, are old enough to remember the dire state #UK was in before we joined the #EU.  Eventually troubles after #Brexit will get to their pensions.  Stupid ‘little Englanders’; we don’t hear the same from Scots and Irish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The workers of #Swindon will survive but, instead of being part of a progressive company, with careers, money to spend and paying their taxes; they will be unemployed, on benefits, with the attendant lack of fulfilment and self-esteem.  Despite claims, #Brexit’s to blame<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>A general election will just accelerate the mess.  We need a #PeoplesVote to resolve #Brexit then parliament can get back to problems within the #UK that need some serious attention.

<|startoftext|>Enoch Powell: ‘All political lives, unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture, end in failure’ Pity failure of these pathetic politicians will destroy #Britain for all of us.

<|startoftext|>A #PeoplesVote will not only give those who voted Leave but changed their minds to register and for #Remainers who didn’t bother to vote to get off their backsides;it would allow #Leavers to confirm their choice. The People’s Vote is democracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The chances of the European Medicines Agency leaving London, as well as Honda and all the other companies, banks etc, NOT being due to #Brexit is less than there being a major tectonic continental shift between #Britain and #Europe before the end of March.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And how much has #Labour membership declined since people have realised the reality of #JeremyCorbyn’s leadership?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trouble is rumours of #Tory MPs behaving with horour and integrity are just that - rumours.  Apologies to the few exceptions; Ken Clarke, Anna Soubry, for example.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She evidently and erroneously believes the stereotype that the Irish are stupid. Events over the last two or more years demonstrates that the #Irish have a sight more sense than the #British.  #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Patrick Milford -pompous git<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You won’t bring an end to #Tory government with #JeremyCorbyn as leader You won’t bring an end to Tory government with a leader who is a Tory collaborator.

<|startoftext|>Just listening to #BBCNEWS reporting MPs leaving #Labour. All put down to anti-Semitism; no mention of their abandoning #JeremyCorbyn's #Brexit stance, reported on other channels. #Brexiteer news manipulation again. #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the sort of vile propaganda and fundraising that’s happening in the parallel #Brexit universe.  What has British political life come to? For that matter, what has British society come to?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Children demonstrating for their future rattled government. A general strike for our present and their future would certainly hit home. However, #TheresaMay is an #ERG pawn and obsessively focused on her plan. In a general strike she’d sit with fingers in her ears saying la la la<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These days any rogue or crook can hang on to their job as a British MP. That's part of our shame.  All you have to do is get elected: promise everything, blame everyone else, have plenty of excuses for your failures - and have money to throw at campaigning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the #ERG perverted version of 'remain and reform'.  #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now we have #TheresaMay being intimidated by the #ERG, #Tory MPs intimidated by right-wing whips, #Labour MPs intimidated by collaborator Corbyn, and now the public being intimidated by #Brexit thugs.

<|startoftext|>Agreed, HS2 will have long term benefits and help North-South divide; the exact opposite of #Brexit.

<|startoftext|>No, it's not possible, certainly not by #TheresaMay. What she can do is corral consciousless #Tory MPs into supporting her fudge arrangement and buy leaderless #Labour support using the technique so successful with the DUP. Any #Brexit is rubbish; May's mashup is just confusion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wonderful!!  If they would do the same about their future being screwed by #Brexit...........<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the rest, starting with #JacobReesMogg, #BorisJohnson, #MichealGove and #LiamFox<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perhaps Joanna Lumley can pick up the tab? #Gardenbridge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How can #LiamFox get away with saying #UK should be changed from one of the strongest economies with a major voice in #Europe to a survival situation under #Brexit? Arrogant, ignorant, incompetent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A visual metaphor for the delights of post-#Brexit Britain  https://t.co/1VIWLr4xIZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With #Brexit we are getting a great deal - a great deal of trouble and future problems.  #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JacobReesMogg changed his mind about a second #Referendum because he is afraid he will lose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Worse than just betrayal - an active collaborator  #JeremyCorbyn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not National Treasure - National embarrassment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More a case of #JeremyCorbyn lays out on the floor and let’s #TheresaMay walk over him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me too!! And let’s start and enquiry into the editor and #BBC partiality. Regarding Humphrys retirement: just because someone is old and worked past their useful time, taking pride in the damage they have done to the country, is no reason to wish them well. Quite the opposite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And all those fish imports from the Faroe Islands will really screw British fishermen. Nice one #LiamFox; shafting the country starting with the people who supported you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Should read: @LiamFox you didn’t have a plan for leaving #EU because even the people promoting #Leave didn’t believe the public would be dumb enough to vote for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hurrah! Hurrah! Not before time. Pity he’s done so much damage. We can only hope the #BBC do not replace him with another right-wing mouthpiece.  #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With all the serious issues at the moment what is the Daily Express trying to distract people from with this trivial tripe?  Harry’s hair loss is either genetic or through banging his head against the headboard. Enough of this nonsense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But #JeremyCorbyn does believe in collaboration- with the #Tories. So the answer is NO; the #Labour leadership will not stand with the many of us who are pro-EU.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But it's the superannuated old gammons who get shown on the #BBC.  #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Regrettably, like Hitler, Mussolini and Mosley, Farage has more ability to inspire people to follow him, even if it's down the road to hell. #JeremyCorbyn lacks leadership skills, ability to do job he's in, doesn't listen to party members and collaborates where he should oppose<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s #TheresaMay’s head-in-the-sand equivalent of John Major’s Cones Hotline; fiddling about with a side issue to look like concern for society. Difference is Major had concern and learned from his mis-handlings while May panders to Daily Mail readers (preaching to the converted)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All true - but how do we get those with the iron grip on power to listen? What calamity will it take for them to put country before the interest of a privileged few? #,#StopBrexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The problems of the motor industry, economic and environmental, apply world-wide. #UK is the only one having serious cut backs and it's all down to #Brexit. Another reality the #Brexiteers are in denial about, or just plain lying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something greatly to be hoped for but recent experience shows they will cave in and put party before country and conscience. One outcome of #Brexit is a total lack of faith in almost all current politicians; starting at the top. #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #Conservative party abandon #Brexit and #JacobReesMogg leaves the country! Oh joy! Oh happy day! #Britain is saved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The rest of London will be thrown to the baying #Brexit thugs; but the Queen has more bottle than our current set of politicians and won't run. Unless, of course, #TheresaMay and her government are complicit with the rabble or cannot give sufficient protection.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#LiamFox reporting to #TheresaMay on his best trade deal so far, secured with a small, landlocked, bankrupt African country: 'I've managed to trade a large area of land and its produce for a bag of beads.  Here's the bag of beads; we need to be out of Scotland by Thursday'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, one of the propaganda tropes about #Brexit was that being in the #EU disadvantages #UK fishing industry; and #LiamFox negotiates a deal to import millions of tons of -- fish. Hope the Cornish fishermen are aware.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And with no effective alternative, no worthwhile opposition, #Labour will be handing another period of government to the #Tories.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All that is true. Tragically, with #JeremyCorbyn as leader #Labour is unelectable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So #TheresaMay and those saying there would be civil unrest if democracy is allowed to prevail are running scared of the #Remain thugs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexiteers/#Quitters have a thuggish element, the sort that comes out in EDF rallies, that is not a characteristic of #Remain campaigners. What's the difference? Different species perhaps?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish! To greasy to be caught and with too many people in his pay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre Trouble is people can't see this for all the #Brexit smoke and mirrors. Generally, I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but it fits with Putin's support for Middle East war  flooding #Europe with refugees.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A quick digest if this information: #Brexit is part of a Russian (Putin) programme to destabilise #Europe and so far it's working. The heat will be turned up on the rest of the #EU.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AmberRudd - Liar! Liar! Liar!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And why should the #EU rescue #Britain? #UK voted to be a foreign country to #Europe.  More accurately: only just over half the population who got off their backsides to vote believed the hype that fed on their prejudices and so voted us into this mess. #Brexit- not in my name<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>'Striking a bare-bones trade agreement isn’t hard; but it would never come close to replicating the frictionless system that allows the crankshaft used in a Mini to cross the Channel three times before the finished car rolls off the assembly line' - ie what we have now in the #EU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trouble is #Brexiteers/#Quitters/#Gammons can't tell the difference between Freedom of Movement and immigration; particularly illegal immigration. They were also not informed that government has powers to control immigration as part of the #EU but has deliberately not used them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>'Fundamentally dishonest' - #JacobReesMogg to a T.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is so ignorant!  We buy food from the world at advantageous prices because we operate under trade agreements made with the #EU. After #Brexit we will be on our own and exposed to the disadvantage of negotiating individual deals as a small country with little bargaining power<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A symptom of a total failure in life is they blame everyone else for their situation. #UK is doing that. We committed #Brexit, an act of national stupidity, but ‘it’s #EU’s fault’, ‘it’s Europe’s fault’, ‘it’s Brussels’ fault’, it’s #Ireland’s fault, ‘it’s #Remainers’ fault’<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, I feel totally sh*t on by our politicians<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The 'will of the lied to, prejudiced, gullible, uninformed people'.   #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gammon steeped in lard!  #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And we are all focusing on the Irish backstop; that is not the only land border #UK territories will have with foreign countries - has anybody told us what arrangements there will be for #Gibraltar? Or is #TheresaMay just abandoning those people?  #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the DUP got £10 million of our tax money to support the #Tories.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a symptom frequently associated with the condition 'bloated capitalist'. The picture give a clue to diagnosis  #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Slight error in dates but not concept - April Fool's day is two days after #Brexit so now we have March Fool's day on the 29th then one two days later to rub the stupidity in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JeremyCorbyn - collaborator<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anybody noticed, if this #Brexit madness is not stoped, the day we are cut ourselves off from the #EU is April Fool's day. How appropriate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Quitters keep invoking wartime spirit; if there had been a #Referendum in 1939 how many people would have voted for war? Losing faith in 'the will of the people'; even more with the #Brexit propaganda 'the will of the BRITISH people'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our fathers and grandfathers fought the Second World War to save ourselves and rid the world of extreme right-wing domination. That created the opportunity for Churchill’s wish: ‘a United States of Europe’. Now we are destroying what they fought for.  #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got it last! #Brexit is the right-wing plan to solve the obesity crisis. There just won't be enough food to be fat. It'll save the NHS millions, if we still have the NHS, of course.  #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If that's what it comes down to I'll stay and brace myself.  #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If they vote against it the Immigration bill won't get to the committee stage. The weasel word is 'try'. That has no guarantee of success and so far everything #JeremyCorbyn has tried has been an abysmal failure but then he's not tried anything much.  #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It is about time this dinosaur became extinct or was at least put out to pasture. This is the only example ever to contradict removal of compulsory retirement age. And we are paying for him, including those of us buying our license with pension money! #JohnHumphrys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is a piece of laboratory equipment called a ‘faecal fat stirrer’ (aka shit stirrer). It appears this fellow has been the victim of its application between the ears.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unless there is a #PeoplesVote, now people know the reality of #Brexit, the government has to reintroduce the concept of democracy into #Britain. However, #TheresaMay and her administration have proved they have no respect for democracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And so say all of us!  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, it’s working, they’re leaving.  #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm for freedom of movement.  The idea of a border operated by magic technology is just one of the #Brexit contradictions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the idea of an effective border other than manned checkpoints is just another #Brexit unicorn. If there is no plan to monitor people movement the concept of controlling immigration is nonsense. It will be just putting a turnstile on the front door and leaving the backdoor open<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Could someone please explain how the invisible Irish border is going to work? How will it check vehicles, commercial and private, and search for contraband, drugs, etc? How will it monitor people movement and check for illegal immigrants? Is it just another #Brexit fantasy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But the promises were based on lies!  #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it translates as 'let's take back control' and give it to #JacobReesMogg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BBC bias again.  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Couldn't happen to a more deserving company.  You live by #Brexit you die by Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No responsible government would ever take this country into #Brexit in any form<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit isn’t the ‘will of the people’.  Almost as many of those who bothered to get off their backside and vote chose to #Remain. Brexit is the will of the gullible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #Quitters are getting nervous  #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have to remember #JacobReesMogg lives in another world in another century. To him anywhere outside Central London is green fields with milk maids, horses, and peasants touching their forlocks to the gentry. #Europe is all about Bonaparte and Johnnie Foreigner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this the Daily Express calling it’s more extreme followers to arms? #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is what we do: cancel #Brexit. From that moment we go back to normal; living our lives, thriving, travelling, not arguing, not wasting money on contingency, making contributions then benefitting from #EU funding, and so on. Businesses can progress and some might come back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not all of us who're retired want #Brexit in any form. Oldies I've spoken to are equally outraged at the rigged #Referendum. What is so infuriating is the reactionary old farts who want to inflict this national disaster are old enough to remember the crap state #UK was in pre#EU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It would show some conscience if #Dyson revoked his knighthood. Even better if the British people stripped it from him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Save the #UK - #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now the #Quitters (#Brexiteers) know how it feels to be betrayed; as the rest of us have been since the #Referendum<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s going to plan then!  #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DeMontfort University honours this woman; it's about time the rest of us put her in the House of Lords to talk sense on our behalf.  #thatginamiller<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This shows the #UK doesn't have control of trade etc in the global sense so #Brexit cannot take back something we didn't have.   #Brexiteers obsess about immigration; we had control powers on that but the government chose not to use them. #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Repeating things you've already said is one characteristic of dementia - you could be right. Perhaps we should be pitying #TheresaMay not complaining about her. Dementia or bloody-mindedness, she'll have to have a personality transplant or just go. #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is #TheresaMay saying #Brexit supporters are a gang of ruffians?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not to mention preventing #JacobReesMogg and his like being hit by new #EU tax laws. #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, instead of #Brexiteers call them #Quitters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First time William Hague has said something credible. #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheresaMay is so fixated on holding on to office and in not listening to parliament or the people  she will just take another clutch of #Tory MPs from further down the barrel to replace any that resign.  #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>

People aren’t trackable in the same way; if a would be illegal immigrant goes to Ireland presumably they can just walk over into the UK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We should stop ingratiating the 2016 gerrymandered vote as a ‘#Referendum’. It invented a new form of corrupt politics - a Scamerendum.  #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Black Friday - except that's being  used for an invented frenzy of trading which is losing it's appeal now the novelty has worn off, except among the zealots- as has #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>According to this, Daily Express owns #Brexit, which will annoy Daily Mail and Sun who also claim ownership.

<|startoftext|>Absolutely! The #Referendum process is the same as an election and it doesn't take a year. If #TheresaMay called an election we'd be voting in a couple of months. Even if it takes a year it's better than no vote; however, another year of #Brexit lies and propaganda would be agony<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Laurel and Hardy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They're not the party leaders one would choose in any circumstances; unless the alternatives were people from the Rees-Mogg, Gove, Davis, Johnson, Farage etc stable. Its that horror which keeps May in the job.  #StopBrexit #TheresaMay #JeremyCorbyn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheresaMay, #JeremyCorbyn, try a #PeopelsVote first.  It will guide you in what the people actually want. Not what you want, not what the party founders want; what we who have to carry the burden of whatever lash-up you inflict on us want. Or we may say we prefer the status quo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is true but not news. Remember #MichaelGove nodding and winking at #TheresaMay as she made an announcement on #Brexit and looked to #JacobReesMogg for approval. Gove gives 'toad' a new meaning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#KenClare might do it but there aren’t many #Tory MPs with the clout and backing for the job. If #JeremyCorbyn came out against #Brexit he’d be sure of winning an election. As it is #Labour will still be an ineffective opposition and Tories will form another but weaker government<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What’s this vote costing the tax payer?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because no matter how bad she is there is no other #Tory MP who would put themselves up for the job and be trusted by the electorate. #JacobReesMogg is too self-serving and extreme, #Boris acts as a bafoon for publicity, #Gove has no credibility and the others are just small fry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hold no respect for #DavidCameron but at the time he was trying to stop #NigelFarage bleeding support from right-wing #Tories to UKIP. Without that this whole fiasco would not have started. Don’t blame Cameron, prosecute Farage.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Eating donuts is a sign of desperation?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So reminiscent of Chamberlain’s ‘piece of paper’ meaning ‘peace in our time’.

<|startoftext|>Regrettably history shows that the people listed and the #Brexit funders will have ways of getting more than their share. Look forward to the rise of a black market and spivs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's called 'appeasement'; it's led to disaster before.  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the conduct of the #Referendum was no example of democracy. #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We had a gerrymandered vote. The information was lies; even #TheresaMay admitted Russia interfered through social media; many people who would have had an election vote were excluded. Despite the manipulation and right-wing press propaganda you only managed a 4% lead. Try again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How do you manage to be so deluded? Of course #Brexit can be cancelled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perhaps some #EU states have better, more effective socialists than #JeremyCorbyn and supporters could be and the anti-EU stance is sour grapes? A collective legislative body informed by all members should be a core #Labour ideal; along with common standards and workers' rights<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What #Tory &amp; #Labour spin doctors omit to say is #EU didn't ask #UK to leave. We are inflicting #Brexit on ourselves. There is no reason the EU should make extra concessions just because we are 'dear old Blighty'. #Brexiteers put our neck on the block, can't blame the executioner<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure where the figures come from but the meaning is clear even if they're over-stated. #JeremyCorbyn is not listening to #Labour members and risks relegating the party to obscurity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This looks like Hitler asking Britain and France to fight for him because his own troops won’t obey orders. #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or is it that #JeremyHunt is finally taking the pulse of the nation? #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not quite: we’ve been cursed with #ChrisGrayling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A general election would not break the #Brexit deadlock. #Tory or #Labour you still get Brexit so where’s the choice? Neither represent the #Remain section of the public which, at the last count, was 48% of the population and has reported to have grown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Regrettably we won’t get a #Labour government with #JeremyCorbyn as leader and if he does form a government it won’t last. That’s the tragedy that Labour has created for itself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True, and until #JeremyCorbyn became #Labour leader, I was a life-long Labour voter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Prediction looks credible.  A worse scenario is that #JeremyCorbyn forces election but fails to get support for his version of #Labour. #Tories are re-elected, with or without buying support from fringe parties, but with a hard right leader. This is taken as #Brexit endorsement<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely right; yet all the #Brexteer politicians talk about is trade. Plus ‘taking back control of our borders’, ie keeping out immigrants, as a sub-text. #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear Mr Grayling, I wish to apply for a contract to ferry freight.

<|startoftext|>Thanks for 40 years of prosperity and peace.  #EU #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A General Election will just get the #Tories back in because there is no effective alternative. #JeremyCorbyn does't inspire and the policy on key issue of the day is fundamentally the same as the government's. Either way, it's vote #Labour get #Tory. A #PeoplesVote is the answer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They're getting worried the truth will out and we will stop blundering to the #Brexit disaster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JeremyCorbyn’s long game for #Labour is to let #TheresaMay fail then force an election. That would be fine except he has made Labour unelectable.  Listen to members, oppose #Brexit or call for a #PeoplesVote to show some political integrity. Then we might believe in him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heard a journalist speaking to #VanessaFeltz on #BBCRadioLondon giving an account of the behaviour she experiences from these thugs; then hastens to add ‘they’re not #Brexiteers’.

<|startoftext|>How come the police moved the brave man, Steve, with the anti-#Brexit banners but these openly Nazi #Brexiteers get away with it? At least shows the true heart of #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Piers Morgan doesn’t seem to get the point - it’s a tree! If he needs an analogy, the tree has survived because it has been tended, cared for and appreciated, not attacked. Like the #EU, the tree has given benefits to the people living round it.  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The concept of a holding bay for lorries is a nonsense! A holding bay will only be necessary because customs/border force processing system is inadequate. Having a bigger waiting area will not speed the system; when the holding bay is full more lorries will keep arriving #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well said, sir; and what is worse than their just living in the past, they’ve forgotten how bad things were in that past. Remember the rubbish state the UK was in before we joined the #EU? They are trying to go back to a past that is a myth.  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Priti Patel, with Indian/Ugandan origins, where British imperialism is subject of deep criticism, cynically using selective British history and philosophy for low appeal. Proud of slavery or massacres in India? I’m proud of the great things UK has done; #Brexit isn’t one of them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Malicious or delusional? Using a corrupted voting process and claiming it to be ‘democracy’. #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These pro-#Brexit tweets have started appearing like a contagious rash. Is this an indication that the #Brexiteers are getting worried?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dunkirk was an exercise in national heroism from an ill-fated venture not thought through. Government started something without a proper plan and under resourced. Ordinary people had to do extraordinary things to save the day and hundreds died or taken prisoner. Sound familiar?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This #UKIP is disgusting but no surprise. If the right wing is allowed to get more control and media time #Brexit could be the first step to a new apartheid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Paname Brewing Company in Paris is serving ‘#Brexiteer’ ale.  It is getting good reviews; looks as if the French can do something better with #Brexit than #TheresaMay and they’re certainly getting more benefit that the #UK.    https://t.co/nHcUSy5MWP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Better stop messing about and get on with it. #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Brexit, the all-purpose disaster: Provides national crisis, constitutional crisis and financial downturn.

<|startoftext|>Yes but you have to go back a long way to find it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‘No deal’ is a frightener to get support for #TheresaMay’s terrible twaddle. No deal = suicide May’s deal = harmful ‘fudge’ Remain = best deal we could have<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Three cheers for them all. MPs who know #Brexit is fundamentally wrong and have the conscience and courage to say so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deb_cohen Try some coverage of the risks and losses of quitting the #EU and representing the views of at least 48% of the population.  The argument for a #PeoplesVote would be worth a listen.  Some open, unbiased reporting on the #BBC would make a refreshing change; quite like old times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It appears that a ‘tightly drawn contract’ means a supplier chosen when you’re tight. Then #Brexit and the rest of this government’s activity can easily send you to drink.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #Brexit bots are out in force; they must be getting worried about a #PeoplesVote. Three cheers for #SadiqKhan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Foreign Office has gone down the path of pretentious twaddle to justify unsupportable government policy.   ‘Unsupportable’ covers the policy and the government<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But the fares go up with no improvement in services. #ChrisGrayling doing the verbal equivalent of the three card trick again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, the #BBC will get one of the 80 experts to try to explain the impending disaster in a few seconds while the presenter interrupts and shouts down; then the one #Brexiteer will get unhindered access to the microphone and an excess of time. It's the current broadcasting policy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A ‘bitter little Englander’ who was a #Remainer until she saw the chance of the top job and switched sides.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BBCRadioLondon this a.m.; shocking anti-#EU bias centred on Mayor’s inclusion of blue and gold fireworks in New Year display.  Blatant presenter hostility and dumb remarks selected from callers to sound as if this represented all opinions. No such reaction when Queen wore EU hat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmm.....pro-#Brexit misinformation is rising fast; as the old saying goes, scum always rises<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't be too sure; the #Tory party is like a virus, just as it's about to expire it reinvents itself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the result of #JeremyCorbyn's 'leadership' and #Brexit stance. With the #Tories in its current state, with the public knowing the in-fighting etc, #Labour should be stratosphericly far ahead. The next election will not be a #Tory victory; it will be #JeremyCorbyn's defeat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or do as so many of we former #Labour voters will, vote for a different party, one that opposes #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And #UK can continue on the straight road of prosperity and peace if we bin #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit has brought out the worst in everything and 'No deal' is flaunted to scare MPs into voting for Terrible Theresa's Toxic Trade-off.  If there's risk of food running out the government will be begging convoys of supplies from US and Trump will present himself as the saviour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BorisJohnson manages to be devious and blatant at the same time. Appeals to the same sort of voter who would support Trump.  #JacobReesMogg, on the other hand, is the darkest of the dark side of capitalism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like an obsessive trying to persuade others into a suicide pact.  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Michael Caine - a high profile example of the stupidity of #Brexit.  Typical example of the #Brexiteer thoughts of a rich person who doesn't need the benefits that being in the #EU brings to the rest of us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We'll done!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not only are there no benefits from #Brexit this is the first time I have been embarrassed to be #British.  I would say 'ashamed' but there is still a core with decent values; can only hope they win through and #StopBrexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now that would be a Happy New Year!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice sentiments; if #Labour opposes #Brexit and ditches #JeremyCorbyn it might come true.  Even just opposing Brexit might give it a fighting chance.  Otherwise we're in for another stretch of #Tory manipulation and corruption.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We'll, #KeirStarmer, having the #PeoplesVote would be a major step towards all those values.  Fine words are not enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And it appears the ferry companies are Europe based; irony upon irony. #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes but #JeremyCorbyn is supposed to represent views of #Labour supporters and provide  effective challenge to toxic government policies. If he opposed #Brexit so we could concentrate on the dire state #Tories have created instead of pursing a personal agenda we'd all support him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can tell a man who boozes by the company he chooses. You can judge a Prime Minister by the public honours they use to buy support.  #TheresaMay #Tory #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit has destroyed democracy but it's been great for hypocrisy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Same logic as ‘shoot yourself in the foot’ Cornwall; an area that receives 10% more from the #EU than it contributes.  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A stream of Leave tweets are coming in; some certainly not UK based.  They have never dared to soil this totally #Remain area before.  Does this mean #Brexiteers are preparing for another fight?  Beware! The mind benders are at it again; next we’ll have another bus of lies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not only is Priti Patel’s argument completely false it presumes the #UK is prepared for #Brexit in any form.  Rather like assuming if you jump off a cliff you will be ready to hit the ground running.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sit with your back to the engine. If the train brakes suddenly there’s a chance your hand will be moved away from your face<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hurrah!  Hurrah!  Vote it down. If that's the path to no #Brexit - vote the deal down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh Lord! #Brexiteers just don't get the consequences of their actions!  If #UK vacates its seat it gives up its rights and authority. #EU can make whatever laws it likes and we have no say. Laws may include improved workers' rights &amp; food standards which'll make trading difficult<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree the list but not the order: #Labour party's arguably worst as it's supposed to represent our and members' interests but isn't; #Tory party's founded on self-interest and is operating to type. On the other hand, the Civil Service implements given policy, no matter how stupid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheresaMay and #Brexit are driving support away the #Tory party now she's doing the same for the Christian church.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh look, it’s #Brexit, a parcel of sh*t<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope all had a Happy Christmas; it may be the last as we know it.   Santa (aka Father Christmas) is based outside #UK; Scrooge #Brexiteer destruction of FoM will stop him entering. At best his sleigh will have to join the Calais queue.  Then there’s import problems for goods.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is archetypal #Brexiteer delusion.  #TheresaMay gives up trying to peddle #Brexit with patriotism as the 'will of the people' line is proved wrong; now she's trying to claim it as the 'will of the Almighty'.  Trying to use the unprovable to justify the indefensible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And after she wore the #EU hat to parliament.  Such a disappointment. #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre W<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre That's one of the #Brexit anomalies; the anti-foreigner red-neck element of #Brexit are expected to accept with open arms dark-skinned workers from Commonwealth countries that the government says will come in to replace the Europeans we've lost. Madness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me neither. #JeremyCorbyn #Labour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It looks as if we are in the age where governments worldwide have so much money they can indulge in vanity projects because all our other troubles are sorted. The reality being that #Trump’s wall and #Brexit are both to keep immigrants out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With democracy having been reinstated and a #PeoplesVote confirming the #UK as a continuing and permanent member of the #EU. Continuity and prosperity restored and the voices of the Farages,  Rees-Moggs and their like becoming  a fading, whimpering, self-serving non-entity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Labour4EU And the worst is, having pro-#Brexit #JeremyCorbyn as 'leader' , #Labour is handing power to the #Tories for another spell of disaster government. It'll be 'Vote Labour get Tory'. #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>'Stupid woman' seems preferable as it is at least half right.  #TheresaMay is cunning, conniving, duplicitous, manipulative and in thrall to right-wing groups; stupidity is just a cover.  However, she is undeniably female.  #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The year democracy died.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #JacobReesMogg thinks his understanding is outdated it must be prehistoric!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or is #Brexit the will of Putin?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So is #Brexit in any form<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The drone has to be a malicious act.  Anyone on the ground with a 12-bore shotgun should be able to take it down. We have enough firearms trained police officers; why are the authorities letting themselves be manipulated? Stop faffing around and clear it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Though they were just misguided, rather than #Cameron, who was too weak in his policies and premiership to avoid losing votes to UKIP, and #TheresaMay who is ignoring the public in favour of right-wing paymasters.  #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anthony Eden, who undertook a disastrous military campaign to recover the Suez canal, and Alec Douglas-Hume who was just out of touch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Having #JamesBrokenshire as Housing Minister is the equivalent of putting an ostrich in change of horizon scanning.  The #Tories haven't progressed past Dickens, blaming the nerdy for their own plight; 'are there no prisons, no workhouses?'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre Step back and let them get on with it. Then give the mob addresses for Farage, Rees-Mogg, Fox, Davis, Banks, and who could forget Boris.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All #Brexit is catastrophic! ‘No Deal’ is the disaster put out to herd MPs behind #TheresaMay’s dog’s dinner deal and avoid allowing the #PeoplesVote.  It’s a tragedy that politicians now have the brass neck to be so blatantly manipulative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s because the ‘government’s contingencies’ include calling out the troops; perhaps to quell riots?  #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is that 3,500 troops to introduce martial law and shoot the public if there are anti-#Brexit or food riots?  Or are troops going to take jobs that would have been done by #EU workers that have been thrown out?   Maybe they'll be unloading at the docks? Unions will be pleased!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's no 'almost' about it. #JeremyCorbyn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As #Brexit mess stems from Cameron calling a #Referendum to stop #Tories leaking votes to #UKIP; it's only fair UKIP centres set an example by taking the big hits.  eg Rochester in Kent was a UKIP hotspot so the parks for lorries waiting customs should be a ring around the town<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #Tories can't get out of the schoolboy 'ya-boo-sucks' cat calling habit; trivializing the most serious constitutional crisis in generations. #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go for it Ken!  If we have to have a #Tory as #PrimeMinister he's the one with cloud and integrity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perhaps his advice is just 'don't do it'.  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At last #JeremyCorbyn has been humiliated into action. His problem is that the house has no confidence in the Leader of the Opposition. #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's fine; better going for quality rather than quantity. If you talk sense they will follow you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh Lord we've come to this! #JeremyHunt 'wants a crack' at being PM. Govnmt ministers admitting UK's most responsible job is a matter of #Tory tombola. Or do they think it's Prime Ministerial pass-the-parcel? "I'll have a go and do a bit of damage then pass it to the next bloke"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An American carpet-bagger or Russian bot?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realTomHa All that delay - great. Then let democracy roll on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If there had been an #EU before 1914 there probably wouldn't have been two wars. 1914 - 1945 31 years no EU two devastating European based wars. 1945 - 2018 73 years including formation of EU, no wars between member states.   #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realTomHa If government wants to do it they'll do it no matter what chicanery it takes. The timescale is an avoidance trick. If there is really a problem it would not be difficult to shift the exit date back to ensure that the #Brexit people are being foisted on them is really their 'will'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realTomHa If #TheresaMay called a snap election it could be held within a matter of weeks. A #Referendum is the same process and requires the same infrastructure. Saying it cannot be held in time is just an avoidance trick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Denying a #PeoplesVote, free of outside interference, without lies, false claims, scare stories about illegal immigration, and based on the better information than was known at the last #Referendum is breaking faith with democracy. #TheresaMay #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CamillaAzis @TimInSuffolk Shaun may have been being ironic but it doesn't alter #JeremyCorbyn's position or lack of action<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That ‘nice Mr #JeremyCorbyn’ has done bugger all.   He’s not provided effective opposition; hasn’t listened to party members; hasn’t  an alternative #Brexit plan or opposed it.  All he’s done is support #Tories and made vacuous statements about the world being a better place<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's doctors, nurses, academics, teachers, etc, etc, plus essential support staff, agricultural workers and so on and so on. #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>'Forge Brexit consensus' - yep, forgery and #Brexit do seem to belong together. #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Idiot statement by #KateHoey.  #Brexit is the trigger for a potentially United #Ireland. The #EU isn’t promoting it and the Northern Irish voted #Remain because they recognise the overwhelming benefit of being part of Europe.  #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plan B should be the #PeoplesVote but that should be Plan A.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or better wig makers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently only crystal clear in #TheresaMay's head.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheresaMay described as 'nebulous' - probably the kindest thing anyone's ever said of her<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This twaddle is from the man without a plan and failed #Brexit Secretary. The #UK government has been fanning around for two plus years and has still not presented a concrete proposal to parliament, let alone the people; and he has the brass neck to accuse the #EU of brinkmanship<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trouble is this will be spun by #Brexiteers and media such the #BBC as an #EU failing rather than a demonstration that #UK is on course to be an outsider to Europe. Part of the #Brexit fantasy is that the EU owes Britain something and ‘dear old Blighty’ merits special treatment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did she not say she wouldn’t lead #Tory party; not that she wouldn’t be an MP. Even if #TheresaMay we’re prepared to be kept at home doing ‘girl jobs’ by her millionaire husband; the sycophantic voters of Maidenhead would keep backing her. Ingratiating #BBC interviews show that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If both #TheresaMay and #JeremyCorbyn continue to refuse a #PeoplesVote they need to say what it is they are afraid of in asking the people?  Ask the same of #JacobReesMogg and the rest of the dog-in-the-manger power hoarding refusers. #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great but these legal challenges don't appear to get anywhere. Is this going to be seen through? #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No - but the people in power won't let us have a say in it.  #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let’s put the current #Tory turmoil into perspective -  #TheresaMay didn’t WIN a vote of no confidence, those within her own party FAILED to give to win a vote that they could provide a better alternative.  Theresa May might have people’s sympathy, but confidence- no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She doesn’t seem to be leading them now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All good and erudite words -but a simple explanation of #Brexit is that it is anti-immigration hysteria, mainly by older people who are not considering future generations, and are susceptible to propaganda by right-wing interest groups who play on xenophobia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GinaMiller should be in the House of Lords for defending democracy and showing the elected politicians what statesmanship looks like. ‘Dame Gina Miller’ - sounds good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So there are some good news items! Perhaps #PiersMorgan would like to take #AndrewNeil, #JacobReesMogg, #JohnHumphrys,  #IDS, #LiamFox, #DavidDavis and the rest of the right-wing shitshower with him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe #TheresaMay just likes going to Brussels or it's an avoidance technique for putting off a #PeopleVote. Or it could be she's using repeated futile trips to make the #EU appear stubborn. #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IDS must be the real pits if arch-#Tory #NickRobinson tells him he's a busted flush on the #BBC!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this prat holds public office!  Hasn't he noticed #UK decided to quit; we weren't asked to leave? #EU has its rules and arrangements, we've spent 40 years helping frame them. If UK decides to cut itself off from benefits of being a member it's up to UK to step up to the plate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>British governments' cavalier attitude through history to #Ireland and its welfare is a massive national embarrassment and that's putting it mildly. Sorry Ireland, it may or may not be an exclusively #Tory or right-wing characteristic, but it is a stain on the UK's standing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Odd how one family can produce the self-serving buffoon #Boris and a someone with a conscience and a degree of national concern.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tragedy is I’ve got no confidence in #TheresaMay and less in #JeremyCorbyn. He’s abandoned the principles of the #Labour party I’ve always supported.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m over 65 and would happily give a microphonefull of anger at #Brexit, plus the way the population has been manipulated like punters being offered a ‘five’ll-get-you-ten’ swindle peddled by snake oil salesmen, and older voters’ stupidity forgetting the state #UK was in pre-#EU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's the honourable thing to do - sacraficing personal ambition for the sake of the nation. #JeremyCorbyn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listen #JacobReesMogg we keep being told #Brexit was 'The will of the British people'.  Terrible #TheresaMay is still PM through the 'will of #Tory MPs', so shut up. You'll have to accept a result you don't like just as those who voted #Remain or have changed their minds have to<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In round numbers in the #Referendum 17.5 million from a voting population of 50 million chose #Leave; that's 35%. On the strength of that we are suffering #Brexit. In #TheresaMay vote of confidence 37% voted her out but she clings on. On that basis Brexit should be cancelled now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A situation promoted by your sometime employer the #BBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #Labour were #Remain it would sweep the board<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We ALL must be saved from #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If 'comfortable' means being content that a third of your party want you gone then how many other buzzwords are just fluff?  Start with 'The British people' in reference to the #Brexit, then 'Brexit means Brexit' was plain twaddle. A continual stream of vacuous #TheresaMay-speak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As #TheresaMay is the head of a party made of basket cases it's no wonder she clutches at straws. Tragic state of affairs when the majority of the Prime Minister's supporters are on the Opposition front bench<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheresaMay may or may not have the confidence of #Tory MPs but she survived being ousted because the alternatives inspire even less confidence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Add: ‘The British people’ with a sprinkling of: ‘Hard-working British people’ and ‘Hard-working families’<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But the #Brexiteers would like to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No point in a general election when there is no effective choice. A corrupt government and useless opposition both with the same policy on key issue of the day; smaller parties without the heft to gain control. We need a #PeopleVote - it takes no longer than an election. #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not right to simplify  #JeremyCorbyn as 'thick'. He is insensitive, narrow-minded, misguidedly obsessive and living in a different time zone. He's also supporting #Tory policies and ineffective as Opposition Leader; as such he is blocking the job for someone more competent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fine words but we will not get #Labour government with #JeremyCorbyn. Even if he could inspire support as leader he is a #Brexiteer.  With the worst #Tory government in modern history clamped onto power, dominating the political scene should be easy, but he fails, fails, fails<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too true - we're all at the end of our tether. #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely right. This useless shower are only kept in place because of our equally ineffective Official Opposition. #Tory #Labour  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>As she's turncoated once from pre-#referendum #Remain to 'I'll be the #PM and do #Brexit' perhaps now she can switch to: Remain means Remain  #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You're kidding! #TheresaMay's an opportunist who put herself up for the suddenly vacant big job. She's there because the alternatives were even more devisive.  As PM she switched from #Remain to being a far right puppet. Incompetent. Only survives because #JeremyCorbyn is as bad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please can we have this woman as Prime Minister or at least Leader of the Opposition. She'd be far better in either role as the present incumbents #YvetteCooper<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The danger is the zombie nature of #Brexit. It may become the great un-dead that stalks around sucking the life out of everyone. #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's start using an expression that has more meaning that anything the #Brexiteers have come up with:  'REMAIN means REMAIN'  It means continuity, prosperity and peace. Or if you can't say 'Remain': 'Stay means Stay' #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote    https://t.co/BUY3htNvjx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great! Let's do that then and stop this nonsense. Whatever's you think it is draining the country financially and spirituality. #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heard a rabid #Brexiteer MP on the radio this morning using the language of a street thug saying the #EU wasn't shown the #UK 'respect'. Nonsense! We put ourselves in the stupid position, it's not up to the rest of the world to mollycoddle the UK, and the EU has been patient.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>OR WE GET A CHANCE TO VOTE AGAIN!! WE ARE THE PEOPLE. THIS IS OUR FUTURE.  WHY ARE THE POLITICIANS WE PAY FOR AFRAID OF ASKING IF WE STILL WANT TO GO AHEAD? #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmm....... #BBC doing investigative journalism not trying to prop up a dodgy government policy - quite like old pre-#Brexit times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hurrah, hurrah!! Bring it on! Where's the risk in no #Brexit? There is no risk.   If the result is #JacobReesMogg leaves the country and follows his money it's not a risk it's a double bonus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is that 'draft' agreement or 'daft agreement? Either way it's shooting ourselves in the national foot. #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's because #Brexit is fundamentally wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hurrah!  UKIP fifth columnist gets her come-uppance.  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>17.4 million were hoodwinked into voting to #Leave the #EU - that means the rest of the voting population, in 2016 that was 45,766,000, didn't vote to leave. Problem is too many of the rest didn't think the nation would be stupid enough to vote for #Brexit so they didn't bother<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JeremyCorbyn is useless as a national leader. Pity it takes a former #Tory party activist now employed by the #BBC to point it out. #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No - we want #Remain plus.  Plus being looking at issues in our membership causing friction.  Uncontrolled immigration isn't an issue as there are controls which the government has chosen not to use. Fishing quotas are a topic worth investigation but better to do that as a member<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This translates as UK parliament is savaging #TheresaMay’s #Brexit which is a bad idea anyway. #UK reduced to an international laughing stock.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>£250,000 - £300,000 and that is after having his salary cut by £150,000 in January! We pay so much for bias, misinformation, and to have our intelligence insulted. This is one instance where age and experience does not bring wisdom, it just blocks the job for a younger person<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BBC drops this because: It can’t be rigged like #BBCQuestionTime There are only 2 speakers when there are at least 3 strong opinions Both speakers are arguing the same outcome so debate is pointless  #TheresaMay’s #Brexit plan looks increasingly shaky and is not worth air time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is what happens when government is led by the nose by populists and gutter press. When self-interest rules and the basic services are starved of support -   The country descends into the biggest fuck-up since the Civil War.  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hurrah!! Three cheers for the #Europeans. Never thought I'd re-tweet anything from #NigelFarage.  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trouble is #JeremyCorbyn said that if #TheresaMay's national suicide pact is defeated he will table a motion of no confidence. That will trigger an election which he hasn't got the following to win.  It will be another period of ticky-tacky #Tory rule under a harder-nosed leader<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Then screw the lid down - permanently!  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have a far better 'deal' now within the #EU that's not perfect. It needs a few things sorted out, notably fishing quotas, but it's better to refine things from inside than to make ourselves the poor relations. #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or have a job, rely on a pension, and so on. Any arrangement that reduces national prosperity hits all of us and the most vulnerable first. #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shouldn’t that read ‘a UKIP party with Tommy Robinson will REVERT to the BNP’? #NigelFarage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Part of the ‘project fear’ putting pressure on #Tory MPs not allow conscience and concern to come before party and support #TheresaMay’s #Brexit mash-up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The joy is understandable and it's encouraging that there are still MPs with some principles Problem is, every time a minister resigns over #Brexit, #TheresaMay just appoints another #Tory troll. She's working her way through the pile until she gets to - oh no! - #JacobReesMogg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks suspiciously like and arrangement pinched off a coffin at some poor soul’s funeral. Apt really with #Brexit about to ‘do’ for us all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh Lord! #TheresaMay thinks we have an army of brave chaps with ear trumpets to stand on cliffs listening for the enemy and a secret stash of Spitfires to shoot down missiles from ‘Johnny Foreigner’. Unless she’s planning to buy a system from #Trump as a package with the #NHS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why can't we have the second vote? If Parliament will not support it we should have the #PeoplesVote. In fact, we should have the Peoples Vote  anyway. What is #TheresaMay afraid of? #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Danger is, as #TheresaMay wilts in the face of right-wing extremists, she'll be taken aside and agree to hand over the #Falklands even if the citizens vote to remain British<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Mark Carney has reached one of the top jobs internationally in his profession and knows what he's talking about. #JacobReesMogg is a part-time backbencher who throws stones from outside the Cabinet. The rest if the time he's running a private business. I'll go with Carney #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #PeoplesVote would 'overturn the will of the British people' then it IS the will of the British people. Does #TheresaMay think there's a separate set of voters who didn't take part in the #Referendum?  And stop putting 'British' into every idea you're trying to foist on us<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's good, then the #Referendum will be just 2 options: 1. In 2. Out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #TheresaMay called an election it could be held before March. What's the problem with a #Referendum?  It's simpler - there's only 3 options: 1. May's disaster deal 2. #JacobReesMogg's no deal catastrophe  3. #Remain for continuity, prosperity  and peace. What's she afraid of?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rather like finally admitting #Brexit, like Father Christmas is a fairy tale  and that someone actually has to pay for the gifts.  And the people having to pay for the 'gifts' are also the ones working and paying taxes, pensioners and those trying to exist on benefits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DailyMail bends the truth again!  Didn't expect ever to put 'Daily Mail' and 'truth' in the same sentence but then context is everything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>David 'Dumb-ass' Davis tries to diss Chancellor's statement that all forms of #Brexit will make #UK poorer saying 'forecasts are not facts'. That means all forecasts on benefits of leaving #EU are based on nothing. There are no 'facts' to support other than we lose influence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pre-#Referendum r/wing press ran deluge of ‘immigrants risking lives to get to #UK’ stories. #Brexit announced -no stories -problem gone. Now #PeoplesVote’s possible stories reappear.  Europeans with jobs leave; others so desperate to come they risk crossing Channel in a tin bath<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Knowingly leading people to believe something which is not true is not TANTAMOUNT to a lie - it IS a lie.  It's also fraud, deception and an abuse of power.  #Brexit #TheresaMay #BorisJohnson #NigelFarage #JacobReesMogg #LiamFox<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If we cannot have a #referendum on  long-term major issues why have elections; they're only another form of referendum?  We might as well go back to having seats in #Parliament bought and sold and the perogative of the Lord of the Manor.  #JacobReesMogg would love it #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And a public debate should be the preparation for a #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s the tragedy of #TheresaMay as Prime Minister; she’s doing her best - lord help us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let’s campaign for Steve Bray to be appointed Head of #BBC News, Radio and TV #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In terms of #Labour leadership #JeremyCorbyn is ‘Red Dwarf’<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Could it be this is #TheresaMay’s secret ploy?  She is a closet #Remainer and grabbed the PM job so she could ‘negotiate’ a deal so bad it would highlight the complete national suicide of #Brexit. If she’s so sure of the ‘will of the British people’ why is she afraid to ask them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What kind of dinosaur is this #DavidBanks? Gets the male sex a bad name.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>At least this disaster has brought unity - of opposition. Except, of course, from the ineffectual Opposition. #StopBrexit #Brexit #TheresaMay #JeremyCorbyn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Delusional fool!  Even if you're pathologically averse  to #EU, seeing the proposed arrangements are fundamentally flawed and the country will be worse off should make you back-off. If #TheresaMay's deal were a Dragons Den pitch to business people she'd be laughed off the screen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And if Julia Hartly Brewer admits remaining in the #EU is better than #TheresaMay's #Brexit deal it must be the real pits. Theresa May has managed to unite so many factions - against her<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Farage may have liked to do something as revolting as this but he is too politically savvy to actually do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly - #Tory #Labour #Liberal #Green #Remainer #Brexiteers, we should all have a voice on this major national issue through a #PeoplesVote.  Otherwise it is just the hijacking of democracy with those with the money to buy the media and external political forces<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spain accuses UK of treachery over #Gibraltar #Brexit deal   https://t.co/pFLgcM8doD  Sent via @updayUK<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The people are bold enough to stop #Brexit but it appears we have bred a generation of lilly-livered politicians; few of whom have a statesman-like bone in their body.  Listen carefully and you can hear that great pro-European, Churchill, spinning in his grave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No #Brexit- hurrah!!!! Bring it on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First time I've had an iota of regard for #IainDuncanSmith. Only because his frustration of the egregious #TheresaMay's #Brexit proposal could mean no Brexit or the triumph of democracy and a #PeoplesVote  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Re #Brexit it’s situation normal. Gutless MPs putting party before nation. Opposition leader working for #Tories. #Brexiteers in power refusing to give people a say with a #PeopesVote. #TheresaMay keeping fingers in her ears while pushing #UK to hell in a handcart - neat trick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hurrah!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like a Third Reich reunion.  #JacobReesMogg #Brexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It is the arrogance of #Brexiteers to assume they can dictate terms. #EU didn't ask #UK to leave. UK knows EU trading terms and conditions; we spent 40 years helping create them. Why should EU make UK a special case? Perhaps we are trying to claim some sort of diabilty allowance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I could not stand Margaret Thatcher but by comparison #TheresaMay does not deserve to be called Prime Minister.  Just proves the Peter Principle that people get promoted until they reach their level of incompetence. #Tories #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does #JacobReesMogg have the appropriate Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) Enhanced Vetting to be with these little girls and boys?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We live in hope! #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just think how much of a lead #Labour could have if #JeremyCorbyn oppose #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any #Labour alternative plan that does not include either stopping #Brexit or backing #PeoplesVote is no alternative. As things are it's vote Labour get #Tory. Odd how #JeremyCorbyn can dress appropriately on this occasion but not when he's supposed to be respecting the war dead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have to admit #Brexit, #Farage, #ReesMogg, #DavidDavis, #TheresaMay, #AaronBanks and the rest of the #Leave conspiracy have reduced me to foul-mouthed ranting from the sheer frustration of having the country screwed by a group who have power and do not listen. #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watch out for #AmberRudd being put in the frame to replace #TheresaMay as PM.  Self-serving, incompetent and poverty tolerant replaced by self-serving, vicious and poverty promoting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And do the good citizens of #Llanelli believe in the tooth fairy and Santa Claus? They appear to be susceptible to messages painted on buses. This is terrible; #Brexit taking grip like a cancer and government refusing to stop it, even though the cure is simple and in their grip<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So let's just stop this nonsense and cancel #Brexit. Done with stroke of pen; normality returns, #Britain continues to prosper; Brits retain protection and right to travel; workforce reinforced, trade deals continue; trade with rest of the world enhanced through #EU arrangements<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yessss!!  Accountability at last!  #StopBrexit #TheresaMay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Boris spent £320k buying them just before they were made illegal; or were made illegal because Boris bought them. Terrible that a politician who aspires to be PM considers using water cannon against British citizens, protesters or not. Compared to garden bridge £320k is peanuts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What does this idiot mean, we'll have a second referendum after we've left the #EU and then have to negotiate to re-join? #PeoplesVote #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have lived under 15 prime ministers and administrations and this is the worst. We are governed by a cabal of barrow boys and money lenders who think the only value is in the fast buck at all costs and that’s an illusion and there is no one with the gumption to stand up to them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JeremyCorbyn doesn’t have tin ears, if he did he would still hear but the message would be hard, perhaps the better for it. He may have cloth ears that absorb everything, or his ears are blocked; in reality he’s JUST NOT LISTENING.  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hurrah!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A staggering development foreseen by everybody except #LiamFox Massive problems becoming part of the WTO.  #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JeremyCorbyn’s refusal to acknowledge the will of party members and dogmatic pursuit of #Brexit is consigning #Labour to another long period of opposition, if what he does constitutes opposition. It‘s handing #UK government to the dark forces controlling the #Tories #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How dispicable that the #Tories should countenance ‘absolute poverty’ as an acceptable baseline or even a condition that should exist at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She’s definitely looking rattled and desperate. One thing’s for sure, a #PeoplesVote would sort out her problems and the warring parties.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Major study finds voters in most vulnerable #Tory seats back fresh #Brexit referendum  https://t.co/pUT261VrMS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Peerage etc go for making money, giving donations and skulduggery to get parties into power, and for having political office no matter how bad they were. Now let’s appoint on merit and start with #GinaMiller for services to democracy and #CaroleCadwallidar for pursuit of truth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perhaps the most depressing aspect of #TheresaMay competence as PM is not just her turncoat from #Remain to #Leave when she saw chance for top job; not just that she pursues #Brexit despite calls for #PeoplesVote; not just poverty and public cuts - it’s that she’s doing her best!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More strength to your elbow Steve. Keep on playing cat and mouse with the #BBC tv editor outside parliament and don’t let them block your message. The only thing worth seeing in these interviews is you getting over the people’s voice. #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If MPs surrendered to populism rather than having a conscience and moral principles we’d still have public hanging, corporal punishment and slavery. MPs represent the people and give voice to their concerns but they mustn’t be in the pay of the loudest voices.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>He’d get my vote and I’m no #Tory.

<|startoftext|>None on this list. If we have to have #Tory government Ken Clarke is the only one with integrity, experience and vision for national rather than self interest.  He’s a big hitter who would face down #Brexiteer hacks out for personal gain and would make #JeremyCorbyn do his job<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed, so let’s take the best deal, the one we have now.  #StopBrexit #StopBrexitSaveBritain #StopBrexitSaveDemocracy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just remember the terrible state #UK was in before we joined #EU and how we've progressed since. #Britain did well (or the wealthy of Britain) through dubious military conquest. Then, of course, there were a couple of world wars in the centuries before, which we barely survived<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This would be true if #Labour we’re providing a credible alternative. As things are #JeremyCorbyn will put the #Tories back in to power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hurrah! #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCNewsPR #AndrewNeil should have the integrity not to have made the insults in the first place; withdrawing the tweet is too little too late. It just attracts attention to his oafish behaviour. This is a right-wing #Brexit media lout throwing his weight around. We deserve better from #BBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is so arrogant of ‘Senior Ministers’. #EU has its rules and procedures; #UK spent 40 years contributing to their creation. EU didn’t ask UK to leave so why do these politicians think #Britain should be a special case, different from other non-EU states. Old times sake?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not only the living Prime Ministers; Churchill, Thatcher and Heath were all pro-Europe, all #Tories. As #DavidCameron resigned after the leave vote it’s a pretty sure bet he’s pro #EU. The #PeoplesVote goes with the territory.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Is this a confession?  Where's he buried it? #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And in the first half of that 100 years there was another European war that was arguably worse as it brought destruction to every country. In the second half the #EU was set up and there have been no wars between member states. #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#JeremyCorbyn is trying to out-Foot Michael Foot. Foot was an old-school intellectual too abstracted to recognise the need.

<|startoftext|>Thank goodness for #Labour MPs who put national interest before ideological obsession. #JeremyCorbyn refuses to believe we can have nationalised industries within #EU.

<|startoftext|>Perhaps an iceberg; then the heat of their right wing rage can have the desired effect. #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Labour government inside the #EU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, #TheresaMay a.nd the other #Brexiteers have made a cock-up; that's because it is difficult to do a good job on something you know is fundamentally wrong and that history will put the blame on you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This poll confirms public opinion shift. How long can #TheresaMay and #Brexiteers ignore it? What has to be done to get some action?

<|startoftext|>Gender is about the only common factor. #Trump<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Not sure it was arrogance.

<|startoftext|>At least #YvetteCooper is asking the questions that #JeremyCorbyn is ignoring. Perhaps with her as leader #Labour might regain some credibility.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I fully agree. The new coin is a direct insult to everyone who voted #Remain, everyone who was denied a vote, everyone who has changed their mind, all those #Brexit casualties who will be worse-off. It will commemorate the denial of a #PeopesVote and the death of democracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And we’re going to have a 50 pence piece to celebrate it - or as the #Brexiteeres would have it, 10 shillings. How symbolic; an awkward shaped #Brexit coin of decreasing value in a world that is becoming increasingly cashless. It’s just two fingers at everyone who voted #Remain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t think you are in a minority. The #BBC has destroyed its credibility for honest, impartial reporting and has become the mouthpiece of government. It’s founder fought against this from the beginning but now it is just the government propaganda unit which we pay for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DavidLammy has more integrity, credibility and ethical approach than #JeremyCorbyn and is more concerned for #Britain than fixated political ideas. Tragically, the red-neck element of the populus are not ready to vote for a black leader; and the kickback from Obama’s was #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me neither  #Labour #JeremyCorbyn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wise words from Martin Amis referring to #Brexit and #Trump - 'Democracies die if the populace gets too stupid to vote in its interest'. What has changed to make voters collectively foolish enough to self-harm?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Aliwoodlands ?? Didn't think I had.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>British Civil Service provides continuity &amp; advice on potential follies based on past government stupidities. It doesn't have to pander to populist nonsense for votes. It's a scapegoat for politicians who can't get their way or want to cover mistakes. Pity CS doesn't have a voice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not since the Dark Ages has there been such a denial of democracy or perversion of the parliamentary and democratic process. That this appalling, abysmal administration could be so blatant in an act of national destruction and cites patriotism as justification is a new low<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Regrettably, rabid #Brexiteers who control #TheresaMay and #Tory government will plaster over any cracks, tell any lies, do absolutely anything, including sacrificing their PM, to get what they want. Pity they have not got the courage to test the 'will of the people's with a vote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As the #EU is a major funder of British research it will be damaged by any #Brexit.  No deal is the worst case scenario. It keeps being threatened so any rubbish arrangement #TheresaMay gets looks like a triumph<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More a case of #Brexit being like a plane 95% complete but without landing gear - it might take off but the ending is inevitable and only a chosen few will have parachutes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmm....#TheresaMay and moral courage - two things you don't expect to find in the same sentence.  That's Theresa May the pre-referendum Remainer; Theresa May the turncoat chancer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A second #Referendum would at least go some way to show that British democracy is not as dead as it currently appears. That's if another vote is not gerrymandered, flooded with lies and manipulated by malign outside influences. #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BBC continuing to dismiss #PeoplesVote and #Remainers. Even heard the traffic report man on #BBCRadioLondon say ‘there’s going to be a big march starting from Park Lane, well they say it’s going to be a big march, we don’t know how many people will ACTULLY turn up’.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And #MichaelCaine talks old man bollocks about slavery within the #EU. #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just proves the old maxim 'you can get away with anything as long as it's the right size'  One MP fiddles expenses, gets investigated and charged.  A right-wing self-interest group corrupts the democratic process to dupe the whole country and the authorities refuse to act #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>........An empty taxi arrived and #JeremyCorbyn got out.  Insignificant, ineffective, insular.  Doesn't listen to #Labour members; doesn't challenge the government; doesn't provide effective leadership; endorses #Tory policies; does not provide credible option for voters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheresaMay - ultimate turncoat. Pre #Referendum she was #Remain. Grabbed the big job when #DavidCameron jumped ship; has reneged on #Brexit promises as well as pretty well everything. She's the right wing's poodle. And she let #AmberRudd take blame for her mess as Home Secretary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're all sick of #Brexit NOW. Just stop it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does that mean #TheresaMay's naivety and susceptibility to bullshit or that she and the government are peddling bullshit to what they assume is a naive public? #Tories #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or:  A royal wedding is the IDEAL cover to slip our bad news where the public needs to be hoodwinked. #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or Dominic Raab is just the #Brexit fall-guy and #TheresaMay is keeping him in the dark.  With November coming up Raab had better watch out if he is the government's guy.  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A royal wedding is the idea cover to slip out bad news where the public needs to be hoodwinked. #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the financial crash that caused the hardship Caroline Flint lists originated, not in the #EU, but in the #USA; the very country our government is trying to get into bed with. #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>'Votes for sale DUP' neatly summarises the state of blatant corruption to which #UK politics has sunk.  #Tories #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, Kent voted #Leave so it has to live with the fruit of the seeds it planted. #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And many of these appointments are as permanent staff. That indicates the depth of this impending disaster. #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Put yourself in the hands of a blackmailers and you are in their hands forever. #TheresaMay #Tories  #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #Referendum was a cynical mockery of the democratic process.  To deny a #PeoplesVote is to disrespect the people and abuse the concept of the #UK as a democracy. If #Brexiteers are so convinced #Brexit is ‘the will of the people’ what are they afraid of?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this the new reality; the electorate as demented punters, manipulated at the will of any snake oil salesman?  Or is it a #Brexiteer attempt at irony?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this an admission that #Leave supporters are a violent mob who do not respect the rule of law and civil decency? Perhaps if #Remainers had been violent the #BBC might have given them air time. Although the right wing press would have made #Brexiteers the victims.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least #MailonSunday is telling some realities. Pity it didn't come clean before #Referendum No doubt it's spun as plucky Brits hunkering down to overcome Johnny Foreiger's actions rather than a self-inflicted shot in the foot. Dunkirk Spirit when there was no need to go to war<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Notice how much more of a leader #NicolaSurgeon is compared to the led-by-the-nose, party before country, opportunist, dancing embarrassment #TheresaMay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And, unlike the rest of us, he has a means of getting his message to the public.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just shows those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it. #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Were #TheresaMay’s writhings an impression of dancing - or the death throes of a wounded, cornered and desperate creature?  Longman Dictionary: ˈdeath throes - the final stages before something fails or ends’<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheresaMay, the cakewalking Prime Minister, says austerity is over, have you noticed?  Does that mean local authorities can have funding restored? Can schools have decent budgets now? Can disabled and needy have benefits restored? And so on.........<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheresaMay dancing to make her speech - looks like an animated medical specimen rolled out to amuse a gathering of suited chinless wonders. ABBA have objected to #Tory use of their music for political purposes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True - the only good #Brexit is a dead Brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quite right; the only downside is that there is another stream made up of #Brexiteers, xenophobes, fascits and so on tweeting like mad to bolster themselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't see the humour in it. British politics has reached a distressingly low point.  Disgusted with both the main parties and that the fascist minorities have crawled out from the woodwork and been given a voice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A former work colleague, not an existing Civil Servant, applied for and got a senior post in #DExEU. Betrayal of principles was understood when I learned it is a PERMANENT position.  Even government secretly acknowledges this process will go on forever. Job for life reinvented<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's called 'having your cake and eating it'.  A painfully common characteristic of British voting preferences. #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perhaps #TheresaMayis living in the same fantasy land where technology can police the Irish border. She thinks the day after #Brexit the low-skilled jobs will all be done by an army of robots; all bought from China of course.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Presumably because #Channel4News has taken over from the #BBC as the source of balanced and honest reporting and asks challenging questions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JacobReesMogg can be pretty tight-lipped when it suits him. That’s even scarier than the egregious #Gove. #Tories<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So he is either lying about what he said (dozens of microphones and tv reports can’t all be wrong, unless it’s the #BBC these days) or he’s saying the #EU is a vital element of our defence system and we need to be a part of it. We shouldn’t be freeloading on the EU for defence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aren’t the #Tories at the heart of the banking system that brought us all to near financial collapse and had to be bailed out with our tax money? And then when we’ve paid to put them back on their fiscal feet they sell of our share to their chums at knock-down prices.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steve_Remainer Wholeheartedly agree, but without an effective alternative, another election will just hand #TheresaMay another period in office in a further weakened position. That will let the far right in and we will have the horror of #JacobReesMogg as PM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As the #Brexiteers live in the past they plan another 'Windrush' exercise. That turned out well.  No doubt putting up signs saying 'No Blacks, No Irish, No Pets' and the like will be legalised again to protect #Tory landlords.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Patriotism - the last refuge of the scoundrel   #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And was it reported on the #BBC?  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheresaMay and the gang are talking up the horrors of a no deal #Brexit so that any hopeless arrangement  they come to looks like a triumph.  They will be trying to polish the steaming pile of excrement that is Brexit in any form.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The unpopularity starts from the top. Unappealing leader, policies that endorse appalling government, ineffective as opposition, deaf to members, in hock to union leaders, rife with disunity.   Why would you vote #Labour? Vote Labour get #Tory and #Brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never mind the 'ifs' and tests - #Labour members and the rest of the country were lied to. The #Leave result was the product of a confidence trick. Now at least some of the realities are in the open we deserve to reconsider. #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You mean Jeremy 'Cloth Ears' Crobyn. It will take more than a massive vote from #Labour members to get through to him.  #JeremyCorbyn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's also a betrayal of the #Leave voters who were lied to and had the results gerrymandered by external forces. The #Referendum was fixed and the politicians have a duty to ensure fundamental decisions are made on straight facts and open discussion. #StopBrexit #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh Lord!  Pie in the sky and jam tomorrow. Promises that require businesses to change their whole governance model are just wishful thinking; especially as so many businesses in the #UK are owned by non-EU companies.  #Labour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The surprising thing is that you believed him at all!  #JacobReesMogg #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bapeterj Congratulations!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JeremyCorbyn is delusional. He is alienating #Remain voters and does not present as an effective potential Prime Minister to non-core #Labour supporters. Holding another election now will just hand #Tories another period in office; albeit in a further weakened position. #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Painful to see a major trades union leader endorsing #Tory policy. Len McCluskey must be after a knighthood or a seat in the Lords. As leader of a major #Labour donor he assumes he can govern Labour policy.  No better than the editor of a right-wing paper dictating to #TheresaMay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AustinEdwards76 No such thing as bad weather only inappropriate clothing. Could be a good opportunity for street photography<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because she's Prime Minister.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JeremyCorbyn WILL accept second referendum if #Labour conference votes for it - AT LAST, AT BLOODY LAST! #StopBrexit    https://t.co/0agCWABQjg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The tragedy is that this humiliating  mess is #TheresaMay's finest hour. Shows the level she's working at the rest of the time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely right, and if the #Brexiteer vision is of plucky #Britain surviving blockades and wartime shortages in post-#Brexit world trade, we really have gone down the wrong path. But we knew that. Once #UK has dived off the Brexit cliff we will be on the beach and floundering<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True but,lll for the current #Tory line-up, #TheresaMay is the best of a very bad lot. Or should that be a diabolically venal bad lot. #Labour doesn't present much of an alternative either for different reasons. The low point of UK politics. Not a statesman or woman among them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheresaMay can't get her mad-cap plan accepted by the #EU so she blames them. It's a blame-shifting stance to avoid responsibility for the disaster of #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And as Chamberlain said it will result in 'peace in our time'.  That turned out well. #Brexit #TheresaMay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And that's news? The power in No 10 is squandered, abused and mis-directed. It hasn't been working properly for a long time. #Tories #TheresaMay #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And it's bucketing with rain - how appropriate. Even the heavens are commenting.  #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You mean Nick Robinson, founder-member of Macclesfield Young Conservatives, former President of the Oxford University Conservative Association and Conservative Party youth group, so cosy with #Tory PM #TheresaMay. As a main part of #BBC #Radio4Today there's no wonder in Tory bias<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dominic Grieve is right, there are alternative options to just crashing out - stay in #EU being the best.  #Brexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s just the description - ‘contempt for democracy’.  #PeoplesVote #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now the reality is clearer even the most rabid #Brexiteer should see we have the right to vote on it before #Britain jumps.  It's called democracy. #PeoplesVote  #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Spitfire is a wonderful plane but it's 1930's/40's technology. The world has moved on and it would be suicidal to try to rely on them now as a line of defence. Typical #Brexiteer nonsense trying to turn the clock back to a mythical past as the basis for the future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never mind a pie-in-the-sky cash bonus; the cost of living is rising now, after #Brexit it will rocket.  What plans has #TheresaMay put forward to increase the state pension for those of us who rely on it and to offset the fall in value of other pensions?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is ‘Mr Wetherspoon’, Tim Martin advocating for -another Windrush?  Swapping one line of immigration for another? Considering how the first immigrants were treated on the promise of a wonderful life in the #UK they are hopefully too cute to fall for it again. #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s part of #Trump’s self delusion that he needs this to make him look bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who could blame them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So what's the 'best case' scenario?  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quite right, and the #EU has its rules and regulations, the #UK knows them and helped create them; why should the EU change them for a country that’s ducking out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think that should read: Even the Daily Fucking Mail is calling it now. When the uber-right reactionaries start telling it how it is finally the Leavers might see what they’ve condemned us to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First glance at the picture with the word #Trump it appears as a burning cross.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Up the pressure then and make sure the options include #Remain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Difficult to believe #ReesMogg's #Brexit economists are actually naive or stupid so they must be lying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trouble is the popular newspapers will spin the outcome as someone else's fault and the gullible will believe them; as they did with #Brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes we must have the #PeoplesVote, it's called democracy, and we need an answer to the Irish border problem AND THE FATE OF GIBRALTAR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you mean #Boris the Buffoon or #Theresa the Dancing Queen? They both have the same core values.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not exactly. I switched from life-long #Labour support to the #LibDems because they are anti-Brexit and because #Labour under #JeremyCorbyn is not an effective opposition or a coherent political force. #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Underfunding #NHS is privatisation softening process. It started with BT sell-off; nothing worked, phone boxes, maintenance, no spending to show inefficiency under public ownership. As soon as it was in profiteers' hands services were fixed and 'oh look, aren't things wonderful'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And what about #Gibraltar?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You and I may not agree with all of Tony Blair's actions, in and out of office; but unlike #JeremyCorbyn he did win elections, stayed as PM for longer than any other #Labour leader, and, if you can remember that far back, after 1997 things generally did get better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lacking authority and leadership skills, #TheresaMay must spend all her time with 'full confidence' in a succession of self-servers and no-hopers, with her fingers crossed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have they been focusing on #Boris and his divorce? It seems to have been passed off as one of the least significant events in his life. No doubt it will be used as an excuse for his behaviour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a thought. If #Boris were to come out against #Brexit it would frighten #Labour into listening to its members.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Government departments will have to make cuts to prepare for crashing out of the #EU   https://t.co/bDEVyRhhcE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cheering thought but I'll believe it when he's standing in the dock.  #BorisJohnson  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bonkers booze baron. Pie in the sky and jam tomorrow- even if tomorrow is 50 years ahead. #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If only #JeremyCorbyn were not leader or started listening to the members #Labour would be so far ahead #TheresaMay would be toast.  As things are, his inadequacies keep her in power and Labour as a disorganised ineffective opposition.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And it is being used to excuse any sort of rubbish arrangement #TheresaMay comes to as she leads us into the abyss. #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More to the point has anyone seen @BorisJohnson @Jacob_Rees_Mogg @Nigel_Farage or any other #Brexiteer put forward a detailed plan for #Brexit at all?  Except, of course, those involving personal benefit, moving assets abroad, removing rights and protections, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2.6 million #Leave voters abandon support for #Brexit since #referendum - just 2.6 million?   https://t.co/XqZioRMc3d<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FarleyDavenport @Andywilds1 #Brexit could be seen as a disaster looking at Leave case before the vote. Result was gerrymandered by lies and external interference Reality has become evident  People have right to a say in what will affect their lives and their children’s That’s Democracy and honest government<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Andywilds1 Regarding the next General Election as an opportunity for public comment on #Brexit, as Churchill said in similar circumstances, it is the most damning verdict - TOO LATE!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And we won’t get a chance to vote whether we agree! Democracy is dead.  #TheresaMay #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When did denying the people a vote on critical, nation changing policy decisions become a denial of democracy?  It is the antithesis of democracy worthy of a banana dictatorship. Is that what the #UK has become?  #TheresaMay #Tories #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fully agree. Living is getting tougher in the run-up to #Brexit and it will get much worse after.  Even if we settle into some form of equilibrium nothing will go back to what it was before this disaster started.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Food price increases after #Brexit; hasn't anybody noticed the way they're escalating now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tragically, unlike #SadiqKhan, no matter how despicable #Farage would have the backing of the right wing media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just found M&amp;S sparking water has gone up 25%. I feel bad buying bottled water anyway so this is insult to injury.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And so say all of us. Duplicitous, exploitative, despicable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While #UK fishermen get what looks like a bad deal under the quota system; in this case the French are in the right. They hold off to conserve stocks just to see foreign boats, including Brits, swoop in to grab the stock. The fishing ban should be international.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Delusional to the end!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Could the cause be simpler; a small example of African wildlife has crawled up #TheresaMay’s trouser leg and this is her way of dealing with it? She is well practiced at wriggling about to avoid dealing with issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Notice none of the African politicians are dancing.  The military officer behind #TheresaMay looks decidedly unimpressed. Is that because of the dancing or the politics?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‘Scrotum Rees-Mogg’ has a certain ring about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NHS maternity units were forced to close 287 times last year. #Labour blames #Tories for midwife shortage   https://t.co/frgQ0cz0Ga<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/frgQ0cz0Ga<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does #TheresaMay mean that after #Brexit we will be applying to other countries for foreign aid? Perhaps 'not the end of the world' means we just descend to a third world country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #TheresaMay had said: "what does not kill us makes us stronger" at least it would have an element of hope. Describing any form of #Brexit as "not the end of the world' is a portent of doom; or in other words: 'were all going to suffer but some will be all right'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why should the #EU compromise? We know the EU trading rules and requirements; the #UK spent 40 years helping create them.  The EU didn't ask us to leave, British voters were bamboozled into voting for #Brexit.  If you choose self-harm you have to put up with the damage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s not just No Deal #Brexit that’s worse for science- any Brexit is bad for science, and everything else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wonderful tribute by the #EU. Has any authority in the #UK been so caring?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It certainly won't be the #BBC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is part of #JacobReesMogg's plan to go from backbencher to the top job in one leap. Openly undermining your leader is a classic sign of a dysfunctional organisation and hints at mutiny. #Tories can only demonstrate this level of disorganization because #Labour is so weak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would you be thinking of #BorisJohnson in this context, or maybe #LiamFox? #JacobReesMogg seems to maintain a psychopathic chill so it can't be him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hear, hear!  One thing I agree with #JeremyCorbyn on is re-nationalisation; only this time without the operating shackles that made state-owned industries inherently inefficient and favoured private industry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheresaMay's problem being her own MPs is self-evident.  There's certainly no effective opposition to give her any cause for concern. #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sweaty and nervous, Raab fumbles his #Brexit no-deal announcement.  Brexit Secretary: the post-referendum poisoned chalice     https://t.co/Jo5hkzxNlE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You’re right. ‘Project no deal panic’ is just to soften people up for whatever deal #TheresaMay manages to scrape together. Any #Brexit arrangement will fuck us up. The only good Brexit is a dead Brexit. Just kill the whole thing with a #PeoplesVote that includes option to remain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed, #Labour no longer represents Labour voters, or the voters it had, and does not function as an opposition. It’s has become a prize example of top-down mis-management. Tragic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheresaMay has the manner and delivery of the speaking clock but with less humanity, understanding of people, ability or use than the clock.  Tories spend £200MILLION fighting to stop sick and disabled people getting benefits    https://t.co/Cg7SocmNA9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is rubbish! #Leave vote was a measure of the public mood at the time and a signal to the government to put that in place. The public must have a chance to endorse or reject whatever arrangements have been made and give voters the option to change their minds. #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How arrogant! A lot of people are down to a point where just existing is a luxury. People with more than they need have always got advice for others on things they can do without<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Video emerges of #BorisJohnson supporting the European single market - this was in 2016; what did Boris decide he'd get out of changing his stance at our expense? #StopBrexit  https://t.co/4lGQzQZoAU<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#BBC news unreliable in Scotland -  it's downright biased in England, so presumably that means the whole of the #UK! As #BBCNews has become the state propaganda machine (using our licence money) Channel 4 has become the go to supplier of honest reporting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In other words: what does not actually kill you makes you stronger, and you don't appreciate what you have until you lose it. #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some people took the #Brexit vote as legitimizing this sort of behaviour. Populism exposes the rank slimy underbelly of society.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>£350million per week for the NHS was a false promise (aka a blatant lie).  Everything else about #Boris is a drain on the public purse as he ‘bull in a china shop’ crashes his way through jobs and schemes to further his career at everyone else’s expense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has #JacobReesMogg ever visited the ordinary streets of India? Not the luxury hotels etc.  How many levels is this offensive person separated from the lives of ordinary people and who does he think he is to dictate what is good enough for us and how we live our lives?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not quite right. #TheresaMay has unveiled a reallocation of money that is already in the system to try to deal with homelessness that her party's policies largely created.  Some other needy area will lose funding to pay for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be careful of dismissing #JacobReesMogg; he’s a dark force within the #Tory party<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JacobReesMogg - the dark side of the #Tory party. He works behind the scenes while the media is distracted looking at #Boris the party clown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good analogy. #Brexit is the equivalent of making yourself deliberately homeless on the strength of something a bloke in the pub said, despite good advice before you did it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Tory #LiamFox calls for savage cuts to pensioner benefits - says 'now was (sic) a "great opportunity" to make sweeping cuts in welfare spending while the Labour party is not such a "great threat".'    https://t.co/EsEhMPC6vD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another example where 'the will of the people' is used to pervert  humanity and abuse democracy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s why #Putin, #Trump, #Bannon et al are working to divide #Europe, easier to dominate and exploit. That’s just one of the reasons we need the #EU and must stop #Brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two future scenarios: #Remain in #EU with stability or #Brexit resulting in economic turbulence. Cost of living will rocket with years or decades until things settle. Stable or not prices always ratchet up. For we pensioners Brexit threatens living standards and long-term care<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Highly unlikely @jeremycorbyn is reading reports on the changed mood of the country.  His key skill seems to be to simultaneously wear a blindfold, stick fingers in his ears and chant “la-la-la” whilst having his head in the sand. #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And certainly not on the #BBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even if 'freedom and sovereignty' were not just a myth, it's a poor exchange for the economic, social, environmental, and political losses the disaster of #Brexit will bring, deal or no deal. And we're going to pay for it for generations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Terrible but #Labour’s creating it’s own disadvantage.  With toxic #Tory government Labour should be miles ahead but it‘s as hopeless an opposition as Tories are as government. Labour needs: a leader to inspire voters to challenge govt not connive with it to listen to its members<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does #DailyTelegraph publish #BorisJohnson's column without checking it? Boris may write inflammatory nonsense to get publicly but nobody seems to be criticizing #Telegraph for printing it. Or is this just what we now expect from what has become a slid-down-market rag?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JacobReesMogg would give the opposite view, though he's shifted businesses abroad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You need to cross reference #JohnHumphrys' behaviour with @withorpe's tweet report with picture on #radio4 #Today editor Sarah Sands' career editing and working in ultra-right wing newspapers and her association with Farage, Fox and Murdoch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never mind withdrawing the whip from #BorisJohnson try applying one. Problem is he'd probably enjoy it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was a pointless newspaper article with sole purpose of getting #Boris publicity. It didn't initiate debate about dress, just got excess media coverage on whether Boris should apologise so his name was on every news item etc, and made #TheresaMay look weak for not forcing him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me too.  I’m a Londoner and proud of the city of my birth. I’m proud to be British; in a union of countries, each individually great and stronger together. I’m proud to be a European; part of a unity of nations that has brought prosperity, peace and diversity High minded; so what<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely right. If #TheresaMay had any authority she would order #BorisJohnson to apologise. He’s out of practice these days, getting away with saying outrageous things for publicity. Remember when he was forced to go to Liverpool and apologise to the whole city for his insults<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, they weren’t actually throwing things.  You notice there was an extra line of cars parked bumper to bumper so the crowd couldn’t get near her.  #TheresaMay #Tories<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who is this twerp saying UK was a strong and vibrant economy before the #EU? He evidently was not there or has highly selective memory. #UK was a mess, economically and socially; getting anything done was a challenge and we were relying on trading with countries half a world away<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another #Brexit delusion: ‘we put ourselves in this situation and if we can’t get our demands it’s their fault, nothing to do with us’. It’s always the #EU’s fault.  Rather like saying that you can’t handle a gun and shooting yourself in the foot is the gun’s fault. #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s an anechoic chamber; a space where everything is deadened and there is no response - like talking sense to a #Brexiteer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The vulnerable and needy should get priority if food and drugs are rationed but you can bet the #JacobReesMoggs, #LiamFoxes, #BorisJohnsons and the rest of the leading #Brexiteers will be able to make sure they do not go without. The toxic companion to shortages is a black market<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wonga becoming insolvent - if there's one thing worse than a parasite it's an incompetent parasite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tragic reflection on apathy and indolence of British voters that they cannot get off their backsides to vote in EU elections; this lets maggots get elected and destroy the apple from within ‘The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men (and women) do nothing’<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And Mark Carnegie knows what he is talking about - unlike #JacobReesMogg who talks about what will benefit Jacob Rees-Mogg.  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If no deal #Brexit means stockpiling food and medicine will this be a permanent arrangement? Will that mean rationing or will money get priority? We are going back to good old wartime Britain so will clothes have to be rationed, will there be a black market in clothing coupons?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’d prefer #Labour government in #EU but that isn’t achievable under #JeremyCorbyn. With #Tory government disorder plus its toxic effect on society, Labour support should be streets ahead, but it is not. If JC doesn’t oppose and votes with government on #Brexit that’s endorsement<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True; all great qualities, but he also supports #Brexit, has failed to effectively challenge #Tory government and actually endorses Tory policies, has failed to provide effective leadership and squandered the massive advantage #Labour should have over toxic Tory administration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParisDaguerre Two months to the next bath! Cripes!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wasn't #TheresaMay Home Secretary at the time?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Certainly he should resign but is he the most incompetent minister in this government? There’s plenty to chose from and this ‘ship of state’ is one vessel that rots from the top.  #Tories<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't speak too soon. Like a snake the #Conservatives shed a skin and re-invent themselves. #Tories<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But it’s not new; we are reverting to Dickensian values:  Ebenezer Scrooge when asked to make ‘some slight provision for the poor and destitute’ -“Are there no prisons? Are there no workhouses?”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What would Winston Churchill do?  He wouldn't have let us get into this position in the first place.  He would have made mincemeat of #Farage, #JacobReesMogg and the other political minows who have been allowed to put us on the road to disaster.  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this #DailyMail taking credit for the plastic bag policy?  Fair’s fair, it may have jumped on a bandwagon and put out a few headlines to get plastic bags brought under control; but it’s a bit rich for this sod-the-world-outside-the-UK rag to claim full credit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this #TheresaMay trying to negotiate with what she thinks is an #,EU leader? Or maybe she thinks it's a #Brexit voter?  https://t.co/U1PBfXZhbl<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>How can you turn around a publication that has become mired prejudice, xenophobia, and reactionary politics? The #Telegraph is the Daily Mail for those who wouldn't admit to reading the Daily Mail.  https://t.co/FdaGJgQ5Ai<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Makes #LiamFox's efforts look a bit sick. A country benefits so much as part of the #EU.  #StopBrexit  https://t.co/Ihqt2pA5aR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And even #TheresaMay admitted there was outside interference in the #Referendum so it is not at all democratic.  You cannot call anything fraudulent thing 'democratic' or 'the will of the people' just because it produced the result you want.  https://t.co/MK1Jv75zzi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is so stupid. #TheresaMay as Corporal Jones in a war we have declared on ourselves saying not to panic because she is preparing for a siege we didn't need to have. #StopBrexit  https://t.co/54H1WpcLHQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The new ‘tabloid’ #BBC News demands press freedom then abuses it.  Nobody should have been subjected to reporting overkill inflicted on #CliffRichard. For example, it did not need licence payers’ money spent on a helicopter to view police visiting one man’s home to question him  https://t.co/qtHGL6rbSf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‘Irony’ - more like tragedy.   The weakness of post-#Brexit Britain is like the most catastrophic drama, with the worst of endings, playing itself out before our eyes.  #StopBrexit  https://t.co/HGRugt4xzg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The government will ensure there are ‘adequate’ food supplies.  Who decides what is ‘adequate’ and how will it be rationed?  Is this a secret government ploy to tackle obesity? #StopBrexit  https://t.co/M5t02cFC6J<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>An example of the desperate measures of this floundering government. #EU didn't ask #UK to leave.

It's the #Brexiteers' job to find an arrangement that fits the EU. #StopBrexit  https://t.co/weHCvloo60<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The Germans and the French are not alarmed at our stockpiling tinned food but we are!  #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s a thought; not only will brave little #Brexit Britain, standing alone and punching above it’s weight, be reliant on stockpiled food, medicine, etc., there will have to be rationing. Presumably the next step is fuel rationing and a blackout. #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoyMotteram That reminds me; I need to check the last date to renew a passport and still get the red cover.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We'll either buy the Mickey Mouse version from somewhere in the Far East or get them from the same suppliers in the #EU but at a greatly inflated price.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Didn't he say that the government is stockpiling food etc against the prospect of a no deal #Brexit  outcome as a prudent measure.  Either he knows he can't cut a deal or he wants us to feel relief at whatever is cobbled together. Madness #StopBrexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The ‘divorce payment’ is just #UK fulfilling financial commitments it has already signed up to; it’s not a payment for leaving. #DominicRaab is demonstrating the total lack of ethics that typifies this government. #Brexit shows shameful ‘Perfidious Albion’ is still with us<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1. Simple answer, just over 50% of gerrymandered vote; real answer, almost none of ordinary electorate voted for the reality of the situation. 2. 50 years, according to #JacobReesMogg, by which time most people who voted for it will be dead. 3. For 99% of the population - none<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>All that is true but #JeremyCorbyn supports #Brexit so all the good policies are drowned out.  https://t.co/an2xase3h0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Right-wing reactionaries, such as #NigelFarage, #JacobReesMogg, #LiamFox and the press barons, are just the sort to have voted against women's rights 100 years ago. Perhaps that's why they have their knives out for #TheresaMay; though she gives them an easy target. #Tories  https://t.co/fB7wmjLwYi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So at least 270 are known to have died through #Tory austerity, doctor and nurse immigration blocks, and loosing medical staff through #Brexit. No doubt #TheresaMay and #JeremyHunt will try to blame the over-stretched #NHS staff. #StopBrexit  https://t.co/2z5MktZvrI<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Never mind ‘grace and commitment’, this isn’t a Jane Austin novel, it’s people’s lives this woman is messing with. No point having someone incompetent but with lovely manners.

<|startoftext|>Yes, start with the headline grabbers, e.g. emigration control  (which we can have within #EU), fishing quotas which appear to disadvantage UK.
