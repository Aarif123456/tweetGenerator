<|startoftext|>@marionmckeone And I would also say that at this point in relationships between north and south, the least necessary overseas role he could appoint #MickMulvaney to!

<|startoftext|>Yes, well looking at this clip from 2015, 1st thing on a Sunday morning, after @realDonaldTrump just obliterated #Suleimani makes me feel real safe.

<|startoftext|>Machines of war are not beautiful,  they rain death and destruction on limbs and homes, for sure they will not fall on you, or your family's limbs, or your many homes, but stop with the childish bullyboy bragging and be a commander in chief for feck sake!#IranWar #Iranattack<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This man @realDonaldTrump has an interview or a tweet belittling or trying to demonize everything @BarackObama ever did.

<|startoftext|>Ah two Irish legends, with an obvious mutual respect. This was the repressive Ireland I grew up in, and both #gayebyrne rip, and now #MarianFinucane have passed 'Ar Chris De go raibh a h'anam dilis' Each in their own unique way gave a voice to the emerging Eire I love.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump Your God, did you ever think that he might not be all Americans God, I am so happy that I live in a small country that believes nowadays in separation of Church and State, America under @realDonaldTrump is becoming regressive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichardDawkins has gotten me thinking, what if we are all looking at @realDonaldTrump's wall fetish all wrong?What if it's to keep the rest of the world safe from these who STILL think he's #MAGA despite all the evidence to the contrary!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>OMG😱 This man runs a country,  this man has nuclear codes, this man nominates judges, this man is mentally unbalanced @realDonaldTrump @GOP #Heisadangertousall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear Donald  @realDonaldTrump ,I know that you're not so much a book reader, but you do watch  TV (constantly) so it might be worthwhile you taking time out of your hetic schedule (hence your 2 minute at MLK memorial) to watch Lord Of The Flies. Might enlighten you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So @realDonaldTrump you have obviously got some poor unfortunate WH staffer Googling 'WALLS AROUND THE WORLD' for you to try and convince the American ppl to allow you build your fantasy . Would you ever cop on and do something useful, like #resignforfecksake<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mellortone @CHM2KXX @mhowe1980 @SethAbramson Same here 👌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This I believe is at the core of what is happening in America now. The ultra conservative evangelical white men took a conscious decision to deal with the devil @realDonaldTrump and to hell with the consequences for Americans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With friends like you @realDonaldTrump who needs enemies!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doubt that there's going to be any dispute over the numbers when this happens #ImpeachTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And @realDonaldTrump ,elections illegally won have even greater consequences #Mullerishovering<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Btw I usually associate the word 'glorious ' with tin pot dictators or despots. Wake up Americans @realDonaldTrump is bat shit crazy now. He may not have been mentally unbalanced 2 yrs ago but he is now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Do you know what, if I read this tweet by @realDonaldTrump, but instead it was tweeted  by leader of my little country #IrelandsAncientEast I would be terrified for  democracy, as I would know that @campaignforleo was mentally ill.

<|startoftext|>...How that propaganda is reaching him—by which channels, via which persons—seems an important if not urgent question. But maybe what happened yesterday does not raise questions. Maybe it inadvertently reveals answers.@davidfrum @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reading this last para by @davidfrum puts @realDonaldTrump words in context now. Putin-style glorification of the Soviet regime is entering the mind of the president, inspiring his words and—who knows—perhaps shaping his actions.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>As 2018 fades into history and we are on the cusp of 2019. As a fervent observer of American politics, who has been  disturbed and dismayed by @realDonaldTrump's behaviour. I am fervently hoping  any wavering Trump supporters listen to this man and answer the question he poses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @JesseBWatters You wish!!! @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/Hz9Tq8lu5D<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#realDonaldTrump is 'loosing' his temper and having a 'biggly ' tantrum #ImpeachTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So @realDonaldTrump let me paraphrase you. Americans are loosing biggly with NAFTA. The agreement you said was renegotiated in America's favour? #ImpeachTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love to travel, but I will never travel to Japan #Stopcommericalwhaleing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WHF! @realDonaldTrump You had one job to do today! And he has a great brain, best IQ, biggly this and biggly that, and he still manages to f@#k up #resigndonaldtrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are ppl here on Twitter who are so so good #Thehandmaidstale #DowJones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh what a 'classy ' man @realDonaldTrump was, and still is @POTUS .And the @ChristianRep are keeping him in office #TrumpResign<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So it's do as I rant, not do as I say#tRumpresign<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So let me get this right,  @realDonaldTrump is shutting down the federal government for that his WH staffers either think is ridiculous or they actually resign over #GeneralMattis. Americans, wtf are you letting him do this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dearest Donald, one question? Who's reading out all of these wonderful quotes to you? Because I would bet all the money I have spent on Christmas shopping that you sure as hell didn't read them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Worthwhile<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And ppl worry about the  fact that @realDonaldTrump has his hand on the nuclear codes ! This man can do more damage with his Twitter finger #Syria<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not a problem, just buy yourself an American president @realDonaldTrump. Simples<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And to think that this man @realDonaldTrump decides what American soldiers do, and where American soldiers go. Who in their right mind would follow him. #Iamtotallyincometent/incoherent/ignorant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had a chat with a friend last night, both of us wondered if there was any point that could be reached by @realDonaldTrump's base where they would realise they've been lied to from the get go. Conceded-no point would be reached! #TrumpRussia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lovely to see how @oneillustration is inspiring the next generation of illustrators #BlazingATrail<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnJHarwood With @jaredkushnr advising #mbs on behalf of @realDonaldTrump it's starting to look more like a really bloody @GameOfThrones episode than the politics of a democratic country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump ,there are reasons to numerous to mention  as to why I want you locked up #LockHimUp , but it's because of the damage you want to do to our planet through your ignorance, that 'sir' is going to impact on my grandson, and nobody's going to hurt him #nannybear<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is not, repeat, not, the way to make friends and influence Irish people #Brexit #Moralbankruptcy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@krassenstein Right, so the man who's not a bribed rich scientist @davidattenburro warned the world that we are hurtling towards the cliff in a handcart unless world leaders get their act together, he wakes up this morning to @realDonaldTrump saying no subsidies for clean electric vehicles !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oneillustration's talent strikes again @WednesdayErskin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is just one of the many tweets @realDonaldTrump has fired off today. This incoherent, rambling man is the 'leader ' of the free world. If @KaynewestKw was tweeting rubbish like this, Americans would be calling for ppl to get him mental health treatment. #Trumphaslostit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>See what I'm trying to figure out, is if any other person's name is put in place of @realDonaldTrump , it reads like a piece of script for a really awful crime series on Netflix ie unbelievable, yet put @realDonaldTrump at the start of the sentence, and I just roll my eyes! Why?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now that's a book that goes to the top of my reading wishlist. As it's going to be far more relevant when it comes out than @HandmaidsOnHulu was when it was 1st published, unfortunately!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump My but this man@realDonaldTrump frightens the bejaysus out of me. As a connoisseur of Dystopian type books, Trump's tweet brings to mind dozens I've read over the years, I bought them in the fiction category, hopefully it stays that way #UnaDuceunaVoce<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smartlyjoan @realDonaldTrump Totally agree with you, his stupidity makes this world an even more dangerous place for those whose job it is to report what's going on. Even if you don't like what they sometimes say @CNN @FoxNews @MSNBC etc...<|endoftext|>
