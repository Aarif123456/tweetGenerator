<|startoftext|>Let's have a look at Boris' options: A) Get a deal. Look weak, defeat the whole of Brexit. Boris is fucked, as is the UK. B) Don't get a deal. Look weak, defeat the point of Brexit. Boris is fucked, as is the UK.  That's some nice negotiating there Boris.  #BrexitShambles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2021 will be the year that the Tories start their agenda, now that EU rules are lessened, of destroying the rights and freedoms our forefathers fought for. Don't fall for their attempts to divide us with Brexit and the North-South divide, unite against it as one.  #BrexitShambles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What in the fuck is going on, and why is nobody even trying to stop it anymore?  And why is it that I'm always right about something going wrong?  And why must I know that 2021s going to be a shitshow?  #BrexitShambles #BorisJohnson #ToryCorruption #Brexit #Trump #Covid19UK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Corbyn's Peace and Justice Project, the membership of Labour, the NEC and Starmer's failed attempts to silence the left backfiring are going to prove serious threats to Labour and with it, enabling of a Tory majority. Not sure if that's good or not.  #BrexitShambles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Starmer's weak, lacklustre leadership, refusal to do... anything and the Labour right's failed attempts to silence the rest of Labour is about to be the death of it.  If we lived in a nation with a good electoral system, I'd be rejoicing. But this could cause a Tory majority.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrisianAlliance Not really the point, my point was that her approach on Brexit talks with the UK were nothing like what Brexiteers make it out to be. Don't doubt for a second that she can be disrespectful and disregarding elsewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Comparing Merkel's respectful, understanding and just approach to Brexit negotiations to Kristallnacht is sickening and if not retracted, should remain a stain on Boris' legacy to remind us what he truly is - a lying, ignorant self-centred Tory wanker.  #Brexit #BrexitShambles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saying take back our fisheries harks back to Conservative policies of selling them off to Europe.  Rather like stealing something off your neighbour, sell it, then demand it is given back for free. This is a hole Tories dug themselves into and I won't help them out of it. #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the rape case against the unnamed Tory MP is dropped.  May I just say 2 things: 1) What a fucking surprise. 2) If this was a Labour MP, particularly one that actually stands for Labour policies, then this would've been in the front pages as a serious injustice  #BrexitShambles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Disgusting. Nothing else, just plain vile, how one can have such a two-faced, sickening and dismissive attitude towards a sector of the public sector that has particularly been hit by both 10 years of austerity, the largest class sizes in Europe and now covid with no help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BrexitShambles #BrexitDisaster  Boris Johnson extends talks with the EU for the reason that we shouldn't extend talks with the EU.

<|startoftext|>#Recount  Let's do the maths for the ignorant.  Biden has a 21,000 lead. Past recounts have flipped 1 in 9 of elections, and usually move the vote by a few hundred.

<|startoftext|>Love the idea that recounting a vote in a place Biden has a 200,000 majority is going to produce a Trump landslide  #Elections2020 #ElectionDay2020 #Biden #TrumpvsBiden #Trump #CountAllTheVotes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This election feels like a game of monopoly where Trump has halfway through flipped the board and shouted that he won, then demand we can't count the money and instead take his word for his landslide win.  #Elections2020 #ElectionDay2020 #Biden #TrumpvsBiden #Trump #Pennsylvania<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a surprise that the polls were horribly wrong again.  The most uninspiring campaign in memory, with 1 redeeming factor ('we're not Trump'), they expect a landslide? He's barely ahead of Clinton's lead &amp; lost votes in Florida which may prove a problem in 2024.  #Elections2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I think #Biden could not have made this any tighter without losing. Michigan is JUST outside recount territory and Pennsylvania is set to be equally close, as is Georgia.  The #Senate will stay with Mitch McConnell however. The #House can expect a modest Rep swing.  #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What in the fuck is going on in America?  I knew it would be a shitshow, but this is just pathetic.

<|startoftext|>Wait, is the Queen seriously about to abdicate?  Wasn't she incarnated by the volcanoes themselves 66 million years ago?  Next you'll tell me Boris is going to become morally just.  #COVID19 #Lockdown #Queen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Prepare for a U-Turn on schools as fallout from #lockdown, the economy and #Brexit all compound to a huge cataclysmic implosion.  I wouldn't even call them U-turns. More like headbutting a brick wall until your head cracks open and someone drags you away, then you do it again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I genuinely think at this point Boris could go "fuck you you're all a bunch of twats and it's all your fault", he'd win in 2024.  However if he apologised and acknowledged he hasn't a fucking clue what he's doing, I'd still think he's a cock. Swings and roundabouts.  #lockdown<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>May we please have our attention drawn back to this, just 10 days ago?  Looks like you just failed, then kept schools open, so it won't work anyway.

<|startoftext|>So let me get this straight.  Businesses now have to stop AGAIN for a month, losing all income for that time...   Then they will have 11 days until a #Brexit deal which will be inconceivably damaging to them.  And now you can scream.  #COVID19 #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The Tories really love delays.  As 4pm, then 5pm, then 6:30pm and now 6:45pm all go by, Tory backbenchers are furious and the nation is waiting for the buffoon called Boris to appear.  All this after saying it would be devastating for months. Pathetic and incompetent.  #Lockdown2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alreadytaken74 Beautiful.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Covid19UK  You do have to question the effectiveness of a strategy that tells us that a national lockdown would be devastating and pointless, then works towards that exact thing.

<|startoftext|>As lockdown approaches, Boris wonders how asking the virus kindly to wait until 10pm every night, or asking it not to interfere while people sit down to eat, or not to spread if people are wearing a uniform, didn't work.  #lockdown #Lockdown2 #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Assurance and assumption fuck you over. That's what we learnt.  Don't do it again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The problem with such a bland campaign is that it means your reliance on the polls is often massive. People going "well Biden's going to win, who cares" miss two things: - Polls don't mean anything. - In 2016, people thought Trump couldn't win, so didn't vote. Look what happened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden's campaign has been EXTREMELY uninspiring. A bit like the Liberal Democrats in the UK. It's been just fighting against something.  It's almost as if elections have lost ideology and become tribal. "Vote me because I'm not him" is the new "I bring change", and it's worrying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump #Biden  As much as I loathe the man who is basically a shit attempt at Obama but 30 years older and mentally challenged, the prospect of a Trump 2016 all over again is just too worrying.  Tl;Dr if you live in a swing state, vote Trump. If you don't, vote Green.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressBeet Jesus Christ no<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's no way that corrupt twat will EVER face charges under Boris.  If someone wants to see their dying relative, nope that's risking lives.

<|startoftext|>March 2021: - Groups of one banned in Manchester - Staying up past 10pm is illegal - Boris introduces new Tier 29 - Breathing is prohibited outdoors - Stepping outside your house in South Yorkshire now a criminal offence - Starmer abstains on the death penalty  #COVID19 #lockdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>274 deaths today. As Britain lurches towards #lockdown again, we know this: Boris Johnson is a useless, incompetent twat whose reckless indifference to leadership, integrity, the country and lives has crippled the UK in a matter of months; and this is just the start.  #Covid19UK  https://t.co/0wArHpffjj<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Lockdown 2:  "We're going to enter another lockdown?"  "What about the two worst places, schools and universities?"  "They stay open."  I never knew school uniforms gave you immunity. Boris sure thinks so. When this fails, it'll be our fault.  #Covid_19 #lockdown #Lockdown2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jeremy Corbyn's suspension - as much as he may have delusions of power - is almost entirely political. There is no way that he was suspended just because of this report.  I don't ignore the problems in the Labour Party - but this is a futile, politicised attack on the left.  #UK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mr Gove, ahem...  Maybe stop being such a deceiving hypocrite. Or is that impossible for a man with so few morals that he will vote to starve children and break international law?  #COVID19 #Corbyn   https://t.co/zM1w4pENg4<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>"The young - who are almost entirely unaffected by the disease - have been forced to bear the greatest burden.  I'd say that's halfway there.

<|startoftext|>@ElectionMapsUK @OpiniumResearch There's two sides of this coin:  1) The obvious "ooh Labour's ahead", which is pretty good considering that less than a year ago, it was on half of the Tories 2) The correct "within polling error", and the fact that they're only 2% ahead of starving children Boris.  Wait 4 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fuck?  Why is this acceptable?  #COVID19 #Brexit #ENDCHILDFOODPOVERTY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's no wonder Scotland wants to leave.  I wouldn't be surprised if the North, Wales and Northern Ireland all demanded devolution or independence at this rate, just to get away from them.  Whoever voted Tory in 2019 has caused the starvation of children. "but Corbyn", fuck off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Sun is trying to put across a British exceptionalist position that this is all Europe's fault.  Nope. This is the Tories' fault for lying, for deliberately forcing a no deal through,  then failing to prepare.  This is what Brexit means. We're fucked.  #Covid_19 #Boris #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like somebody just realised that ending free movement with the EU means ending free movement for British citizens. Don't blame this on Europe.  More like: "UK refuses to negotiate post-Brexit; EU prepares for no deal by readying borders"  #Covid_19 #Brexit #NoDealBrexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The policies this government has been doing - starving children, destroying the NHS, leaving people to die, separating families that need help - are reminiscent of the late 1800s.  How can Tory MPs not realise the fact that maybe Rayner called them scum because of what they want?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet Boris Johnson comparing both the current and previous Labour leaders at once to IRA sympathisers and terrorists in the middle of a debate is acceptable?  Pathetic. The only ways Tories can gain moral status is through shameful exaggeration.  #COVID19 #ToryScumbags<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SocialistPolls The USSR won, ignoring politics, just the USA went:  "Heyy, uhh, race you to that!"  And won it because they'd been preparing that specific thing, like a sullen child. Of course, they wrote history as the West took down Gorbachev just as the Soviets were becoming morally correct.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My prediction is fairly similar. Polls suggest a 350-190 scale win for Biden, but with higher Republican turnout and the probable slightening of Biden's lead, as well as potential polling errors, make that unlikely.

<|startoftext|>It's sad that we've come to this.  Boris Johnson is the laziest, most stuck up, incompetent, sociopathic, apathetic excuse for a PM we've ever had. Children should not EVER go hungry.

<|startoftext|>Equalities minister Kemi Badenoch said that we should ban teaching about inequalities.

<|startoftext|>"Please do meet me, and I can lecture you on how Serco is more important than the lives of these children"  Abhorrent. No government since the 19th century would show such disinterest in the suffering of the vulnerable - and yes, I even include Thatcher in that.  #ToryScumbags<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe if you don't want Angela Rayner to call you Tory scum, you should perhaps stop voting for vulnerable children to fucking starve at Christmas in the middle of the greatest recession for centuries and a pandemic?  #COVID19 #ToryCorruption #ToriesOut #AndyBurnham #UK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boris is genuinely willing to destroy what little left of his reputation he has and sacrifice the loyalty of his Northern MPs just for the sake of £5 million. A sum that would last Serco about five minutes.  It's ridiculous how much contempt Tories hold for the North.  #ToriesOut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/Wu3rfcJu7A This could be an issue that could fracture relations between previously loyal Northern Tory MPs and Boris, with most MPs with a sense of decency supporting Burnham.

<|startoftext|>As the North rebels slowly and painfully, Boris insists his package is generous.  The one that would last Serco Test and Trace just over 14 minutes. Generous. For 3 million people.  Wow.  #ToriesOut #ToryCorruption #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Boris Johnson can't run the NHS, can't help the economy, can't do Brexit, can't beat COVID, can't save jobs, can't do lockdowns without failing, can't even answer straight questions, can't sack Cummings, and can't do school exams.

<|startoftext|>#TheWeekInTory  The government is allowing classes up to 60 in size, while also demanding students not to congregate.

<|startoftext|>As the UK once again misses a target that nobody expected it would reach anyway, the government removed its testing data.  Because you know, if you don't want to say the truth, you can say whatever the hell you want, but only if you're a Tory MP.  #tests #Covid19<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#TrumpTaxReturns  Donald Trump hasn't paid taxes for 10/15 years, and once paid $750 (£550) to the US, despite paying $15,000 in India.

<|startoftext|>Fucking hell.  The hate-driven meaningless insults thrown at Labour MPs - especially Dawn Butler - for sending their condolences over the recent incident are sickening to say the least.  What petty, pathetic little twats.  #COVIDー19 #Croydon #dawnbutler<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Universal Basic Income is a genuinely good idea in an unemployment crisis as big as this (to transition to it) and thus the Lib Dems joining the Greens in advocating for it is a good step forward.  Labour really needs to catch up, the Lib Dems are basically Tories.  #UK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews You didn't win the popular vote last time, and you're set to fuck this one up even harder. Your Senate majority is razor thin and you lost your House majority in 2018.  Incompetent neoconservative clot.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Prime Minister's Questions continues to be an utter mess, with Boris Johnson hearing different questions and responding with largely nonsense, hoping for cheap, pre-prepared laughs, rather than actually answering questions.

<|startoftext|>NHS Covid-19 App, after 673 years and 11 months of saying "maybe next month" (ahem, Brexit), has finally lurched from the depths.

<|startoftext|>@BritainElects @IpsosMORI I served with Sir King Prince Keith Starmer the Second in the Korean War, and saw him as Labour leader meet with the North Koreans and shake his hand and assure him that Labour would be 20 points ahead, in front of all the regiment.

<|startoftext|>@xeccar @Keir_Starmer He really does not deserve that respect.  Breaking international law, killing tens of thousands, breaking his own rules, his innumerable children and his constant unfortunate remarks on every single type of person that isn't him; he doesn't deserve that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@britainelects @YouGov We're talking a 26 point lead that has been decimated within less than a year here, and it's alright trying to go against Starmer with whimsical fantasies of 20 points ahead and the such, but remember Labour just got trounced in 2019. This is serious, encouraging progress.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelenWooldrid14 @britainelects @mikegalsworthy @YouGov It's the representation that gets changed, not the voter intention - so it'd be exactly the same, obviously barring historical unpredictable side effects.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>3,997 people tested positive for #Covid19 today in the UK.

<|startoftext|>#PMQs #TestingScandal  Prime Minister avoids questions as per usual because he's fucked something up as per usual.

<|startoftext|>@JerseyBoy43 @melissamllr97 @EvNov33 Turkey, Poland, Hungary, Russia and now Czechia appear to be cementing as right-wing populist, and Italy refuses to change - Spain is the only real major European nation with a leftist leader, not counting Macron (social liberal)  That probably means the EU could soon be worrying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JerseyBoy43 @melissamllr97 @EvNov33 I'm quite worried for the elections in Germany and France, because Merkel - as neolib as she may be - respects German institutions, whereas her successor could easily not; and Macron's opponent is a far-right populist nutcase.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JerseyBoy43 @melissamllr97 @EvNov33 Labour had a brief turn to demsoc with Corbyn in 2015-2020, but with Starmer refusing to say or do... well anything, then the chances of a real leftist Labour are gone.  Press freedom in the UK also doesn't exist, so they alienate voters from the left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love how my phone autocorrects "news" to "mess".  How apt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JerseyBoy43 @melissamllr97 @EvNov33 Our Labour increasingly acts like the US Dems, especially with Tony Blair, refusing to back nationalisation or even properly solve poverty and inequality.  Britain's last true leftist PM was probably Harold Wilson in the early 1970s, and before that Clement Attlee in the 1940s.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JerseyBoy43 @melissamllr97 @EvNov33 I like to think of it as legalised robbery and exploitation, the idea that wages aren't higher than productivity, or that such a small amount of people are enabled to gain taxpayer money in such an easy fashion.  I've shifted left as I grow older, but was never a liberal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JerseyBoy43 @melissamllr97 @EvNov33 By socialism for the few, I mean in their perspective (seen as many view socialism as just free money for everyone and poverty, which is contradictory).  It pretends to be meritocratic, whilst at the same time blatantly being elitist and cronyist, as well as inherently worsening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@f00n @David__Osland And don't forget Russian donors, which stinks very much of Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JerseyBoy43 @melissamllr97 @EvNov33 Capitalism's sole purpose, especially in the US, is to serve as "socialism for the few, imposition of poverty for the many" - the idea that a small amount can benefit from huge subsidies while the rest are expected to live in poverty, and can't do anything to prevent it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JerseyBoy43 @melissamllr97 @EvNov33 Britain used to have a largely nationalised economy until the post-war and especially Thatcher-Major, and frankly the privately owned services are both pitifully under performing and massively overpriced, as well as not providing all rights to workers.  Capitalism doesn't work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melissamllr97 @JerseyBoy43 @EvNov33 Hurling empty words doesn't achieve anything. This is childish at best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melissamllr97 @JerseyBoy43 @EvNov33 Backtracking again. Not going to respond, as you're going in circles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melissamllr97 @JerseyBoy43 @EvNov33 That's not a question, and completely disregards the entire discussion. I will remind you a final time that I've retracted that, as I shouldn't really need to repeat myself this much.  I see no reason to continue this, you're just attempting to backtrack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JerseyBoy43 @melissamllr97 @EvNov33 I'm a democratic socialist, which derives from how I feel that the people are underrepresented - we need a national and unified trade union with serious power, the 1% to properly contribute, and for all welfare + wages to increase. I'd explain more, but character limits exist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melissamllr97 @JerseyBoy43 @EvNov33 You have refused to answer what I ask, dodge every response and are trying to find something wrong with me? I don't quite see what you're so irritated over.  I've said it numerous times. Either give me a genuine question, or stop arguing, as I've been courteous throughout.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thatcher was bad.  Major was ineffectual and Blair refused to enact change.  Brown crashed the economy and then partially fixed it.  But the last 10 years - mostly the last year - is something of another level, more hate-driven and narcissistic, with complacency and ignorance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melissamllr97 @JerseyBoy43 @EvNov33 I just paraphrased your point. Answer my question, as I've answered all yours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JerseyBoy43 @melissamllr97 @EvNov33 I find there are three types (as with most ideologies, usually).  One type is the kind that genuinely listens but doesn't want to change.  One type is the one that will slander anything you say if they disagree.  One could be swayed if persuaded.  The 2nd one is far too common.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melissamllr97 @JerseyBoy43 @EvNov33 You're saying by liking a post, one can cause people to have lower wages, renounce any previous beliefs and insult all service workers who have ever lived?  Please elaborate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melissamllr97 @JerseyBoy43 @EvNov33 That I can agree with, however I also think we should have discussions with liberals and other leftists alike so that we can find common ground.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melissamllr97 @JerseyBoy43 @EvNov33 You sound like you're actively trying to find a problem, which I find quite amusing yet sadistic.  I've addressed the issue several times and you're dodging. If you actually looked, I said on this thread of my beliefs.  If you have genuine queries, ask. If not, stop wasting time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McAuleyATL out of all the people in the world, they chose the one who is a closet racist neoliberal rich white old man who probably won't survive to the end of his term and is deteriorating mentally<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melissamllr97 @JerseyBoy43 @EvNov33 You are reading something different to what I am typing, and now you're trying the "just wants clout" card.  Once again, I'll ask you to read through everything I've said in order and that should answer any questions you have.  If you have more questions then feel free to ask.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JerseyBoy43 @melissamllr97 @EvNov33 Yes, and it should be extended so that fast food workers (and indeed all workers regardless) have basic rights like holiday and sick pay, maternity care, proper pensions and in America - health insurance.

<|startoftext|>@melissamllr97 @JerseyBoy43 @EvNov33 If you'd read what I'd said then you'd realise I long ago retracted the statements as a genuine mistake. This appears to be a mistake on your part and thus you should apologise.  I'm joking, but seriously, I've explained that what I said isn't what I think a while back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow, the Conservatives genuinely have a snitch hotline.  How sad.  What kind of country does this? And more importantly: how many people will be joining me in reporting Dominic Cummings?  #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melissamllr97 @JerseyBoy43 @EvNov33 You aren't even reading what I'm saying. Kind of a pointless endeavour if you ask me, trying to start an argument when you have no reason.  Ask me what you'd like me to answer, or stop responding. No need for the cancelling, we're not in primary school.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melissamllr97 @JerseyBoy43 @EvNov33 You're saying I renounced those statements because... you think I actually think that? Wow.  Simply, so I don't need to repeat myself again: - Cancelling isn't the same as criticism. - Opinions aren't weapons to be used to against one another, they're ideals to be aimed toward.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JerseyBoy43 @melissamllr97 @EvNov33 Yep, agreed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melissamllr97 @JerseyBoy43 @EvNov33 Missing the point. Saying "this person is fake" for having a different opinion isn't constructive, usually isn't true or at least isn't reflective of the context (it is a warning sign, rather than evidence), and thus doing this kind of thing to people plays into rightists hands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JerseyBoy43 @melissamllr97 @EvNov33 Again, I've been quite vague because tweets are hard to explain things fully in, but in the short form - trying to go "this person is a fraud for saying x" isn't criticism as it doesn't have any real point to it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JerseyBoy43 @EvNov33 @melissamllr97 Criticism isn't the same as canceling.  Saying "I don't agree with this person's opinion" is fine and I explicitly said I'd be happy to discuss further. Criticism is a pillar of democracy.  Saying "this person is a fraud/fake for saying x" isn't, as it doesn't achieve anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JerseyBoy43 @EvNov33 @melissamllr97 Maths error, mainly. My mistake, but like I said I don't expect to be interrogated for potentially having another opinion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melissamllr97 @JerseyBoy43 @EvNov33 It was implied that the mistake was both the statement (which I've already withdrawn) and the like, however I hadn't anticipated I was going to be interrogated to this depth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JerseyBoy43 @EvNov33 @melissamllr97 Like I have told her in DMs, I made a mistake and apologised, but unfollowed because frankly I'd rather not be cancelled for having another opinion.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#WithdrawalAgreementBill  Boris Johnson sinks to new levels of malicious incompetence as he fights his own MPs over obligation to HIS OWN deal that basically was the only defining factor of his election campaign.

<|startoftext|>@Logos235 What do you mean turning?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Public opinion will also fall of Brexit, as the delusions of grandeur will wear off when many are now unemployed, even homeless - however slowed by press.  Trade deals - haha, fuck no.  I can guarantee 1+ Cummings-scale cockup will happen, but one that devastates the UK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The UK is already in terminal decline - but this will definitely be the straw that breaks the camel's back.  It will lose its reputation as a stable, globalist and democratic regional power basically immediately after it leaves the EU.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The press, in this situation would obviously blame Labour for the misgivings and concessions forced on the UK.  But with no other option, and a half-decade long depression, the UK wouldn't have a choice.  And it would be the Tories' fault, despite what the press would say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I make it my prediction that the UK will be thoroughly fucked by Brexit, and a Labour gov. (elected either in 2024 or in a snap election) will begin rejoining the EU.  This means serious concessions.  The 2020s will be the UK's self-inflicted fall from even regional relevance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(NB: I find it peculiar that this spelling is actually incorrect, it should be Miliband.)<|endoftext|>

So instead, the Prime Minister sulks out like a child. Pathetic.  #Covid19 #EdMilliband<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelRosenYes 90% of people think they know exactly what they're on about, but only a very slim percentage of those care to deliberate and actually research their opinions.

<|startoftext|>Let me clarify:  Biden would be preferable to Trump for the White House.  Biden is unfit for the Presidency.  Trump is near far-right, thus Biden is the better choice.  Biden doesn't care about you, and is right-wing. He won't stand up for your rights.  All 4 can and do co-exist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imagine telling people just over 2 decades ago the Telegraph columnist Boris Johnson would become PM, kill 50,000 by ignoring science, make 15 U-turns in a year, do Brexit in a manner so chaotically that his own MPs go against it, whilst also breaking international law.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jeremy_hume Partly that, but mainly: - Local lockdowns have largely failed - The government ushering people into school/work/shops has helped transmit it more, even though especially work isn't necessary in offices in most cases<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nearly 3000 people infected with Covid today in the UK.  There is no way testing has quintupled in two months, thus we are definitely in the opening stages of a second wave.

<|startoftext|>For those in the new #Glasgowlockdown, here's the old rule of thumb:  If there's money involved (or allowing parents to work and spend) - then you can do whatever the hell you want, as long as you accept responsibility.

<|startoftext|>I find it rather peculiar that over 2 million people are considered to be in areas too high risk as to visit other households, no matter their connections... however sending children to school with hundreds of other households is fine.  #Pubs #uk #COVID #BackToSchool2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pinkladyfoxx You really think that Donald Trump - the expanding and obese 74 year old man increasingly reliant on drugs and refusing to exercise - will live to 2028? The chances of that one are probably even less than Biden reaching 2024.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Knaapmans Of course I don't wish to be proved right, my views are cynical and blunt at the best. That is saying that I wish for more innocent people to die - the fact that I don't means that I am not willing to support these riots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Knaapmans However it is far more stupid to put others at risk, including themselves, by attending a massive rally for a policy the government has made clear they won't listen to and the majority of the public has made clear they don't support.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@f00n It just seems impossible that a recession of this scale, growing global tensions, right-wing populism, oil trouble, civil unrest, unemployment, inequalities, Covid and the fall in government trust can be stopped from colliding in a painful, slow cataclysmic global mess by winter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DonaldTrump #2020Election  Stop ruling out the possibility of Trump winning again.

<|startoftext|>@PotniaLive Sweden actually had a pretty bad run, considering its population is sparse and low. Asia-Pacific closed quickly.

<|startoftext|>To those blindly hoping the world returns to pre-2020 next year...  The events of this year haven't really begun. Europe (esp.

<|startoftext|>#COVIDー19 infected 1715 today in UK, the highest number of confirmed infections since May 29.  Even in spite of higher test rates, these are worrying numbers. This is about 2-3x the average between a month and two months ago.  I'm sure this is somehow the public's fault.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PotniaLive This is due to lockdown measures.  The R0 of the virus is between 3 and 4 and that means that it could have spread far more rapidly than it did end up doing under lockdown.  These low statistics are thanks to measures.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IgorBeuker Corona is at 60% of influenza deaths despite the fact that although 24,800,000 people were infected with Covid (0.3% of the world), influenza infects about 10-20% of the world yearly.  That means the mortality rate of flu would be about 30 times lower.  Of course its a pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@britainelects @OpiniumResearch By the way, to those going #20pointsahead and that...  The election is 4 years away.

<|startoftext|>@WilliamDWheeler If the population united behind a third party or at least a significant portion in America then they could have a significant effect.

<|startoftext|>@JacobPatriotic You mean of the one walking towards the police, hands up, saying "I just killed somebody"? He shot two people and blew someone's arm clean off, why on earth would these be self defence...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JacobPatriotic Him shooting two people is self-defence for what exactly? He clearly wasn't being attacked by them or provoked by them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is coming from the person who threw the 2017 and 2019 elections and enabled the Conservatives to continue destroying British institutions for the sake of disliking his policies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JacobPatriotic Example: last week, Kyle Rittenhouse - a hard right terrorist - shot and killed two people with the alibi of bullying in childhood  Far-right terrorists kill above 100 people a year, and increasing massively year on year.  Like I said, this isn't the sole and only reason.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JacobPatriotic A considerable amount of that is caused by the far-right, some of it is caused by underfunding of public services, and the last bit is absolute bullshit.  I agree democracy is flawed, but it is far, far better than the alternative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zxlfbeschikking That's because whereas influenza has a death rate of 0.1%, whereas Covid has a death rate between 2% and 10% - higher especially for the elderly, and depending on treatment. It also leaves a considerable portion more permanently injured.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JacobPatriotic Mosley is long dead, as is Hitler, thankfully.  Has it ever occurred to you how there was a reason why fascism has gone? And why right-wing militias, the erosion of democracy, these are threats?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@oscarjsantos57 Either they just don't allow elections or they only have parties who represent similar ideologies.

<|startoftext|> https://t.co/nwznvMKwFt  It is deplorable how far the Trump campaign and their affiliates and supporters will go to trick, cast doubt and manipulate to get him into power.

<|startoftext|>@oscarjsantos57 They die because they aren't valued to be of worth to the system and hence aren't actually given any chances to get anywhere and die in poverty, as their education may not be as good as the rich.

<|startoftext|>Britain First is a terrorist organisation that only functions from hatred of minorities.

<|startoftext|>Capitalism kills 20,000,000 yearly, exceeding the Black Book of Communism's alleges each 4.7 years.  It also relies on imbalanced trade + development, slave labour (outsourcing), destroying the planet as well as worker's rights.  Don't listen when conservatives claim otherwise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@airbiscuit7 Vague and unfounded.  Communism is an economic and social principle built on equality and equity to benefit the people - it in itself has nothing to do with the unjust nature of previous "socialist" states and their oppressive natures.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Phil_Lewis_ It's almost as if Trump's America wants to be seen as a police state at this point, with a "well who cares, fuck them up" attitude to rioters and haphazard approach to any form of human rights.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TooSmalley No no, I agree with you. The Soviet Union and China alike were totalitarian and didn't care if they committed genocides on a large scale - however they also weren't really communist.  What I'm saying is democratic socialism and communism alike are much better alternatives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@airbiscuit7 Soviet socialism is not communism, and the Soviet Union was a ruthless autocracy masquerading under the guise of socialism.  Once again, don't believe everything people tell you, as it often is based on half-truths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every day, 3,000 people die worldwide from capitalist policies. That is nearly 3 a minute.  By supporting it, you legitimise the deaths of hundreds of millions and the exploitation of billions, including yourself.  Don't listen when conservatives tell you that communism is worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember: When a conservative tries to argue against communism: - Poverty is proof of capitalism's fail - Capitalism has killed more than communism - Soviet socialism is not communism - Communism and socialism aren't the same thing - They don't know what either means anyway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@prageru Because Soviet and Chinese communism is definitely not justified, and because capitalism has impoverished, killed or ruined the lives of more people, especially considering imperialism of the 19th century or poverty in the modern day, thus it would be hypocritical.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Communism is trending is it?  Cool, I'll just send out my reminder that capitalism has killed more lives than communism, despite all that people tell you - and continues to do so.  Poverty kills about 1 million a year (think about the scale of that) yet billionaires can exist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do average people defend the rich when they are told to pay their share in taxes to the nation?  And at the same time, support corporate bailouts when the rich cause a recession then demand money?  Profound stupidity on a massive scale.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Liberals and centrists don't quite seem to understand that quietly contemplating the legitimacy of a problem doesn't rectify it.  If you want to fix something, you don't stand there watching it and wondering if it should be like that, you get to work on repairing it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden I don't agree with a great deal this man says, but this is one of the few good things.  Sometimes you need to look for the good side.  Then you can feel free to spend the next year looking for the bad stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage Yes, because although we're now all much poorer, far more inequal, our democratic functions corrupted, our leader an embarrassment to the nation, millions starving on the streets, Scotland wanting out, and 10 years of relentless austerity...  It's now all some refugee's fault?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelRosenYes It's the British exceptionalism that has persisted in some form in half the population, the idea that we are superior to others despite... everything, thus we have powers to do what we want.  Brexit threw all that nonsense - rightly - back in their faces for 4 straight years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel as if capitalism is the very analogy of "freedom of poverty".  You want a vote? Sure, you're all easily suggestible and will vote for us. You want a union? Sure, but we're taking all its power. You want to live? Work. You can't work as there's no jobs? Then get fucked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nowhere else would "nonce" somehow manage to trend other than the good old not-that-United-Kingdom...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#COVID19  1,522 new cases in the UK.  For reference, these are levels similar to the end of May to early June. Even including the increase in tests - this is similar to 2 months ago.

<|startoftext|>Well, yes, because it's not like you were the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change and could've done that "greener" idea nearly a decade ago?

<|startoftext|>#LibDemLeadership  Ed Davey and Layla Moran - especially the latter - appear just as leftist if not even more leftist in some elements than Keir Starmer's Labour.  This really won't end well - the Tories can easily use this to divide and conquer.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@comradereb3l The Conservative Party of Britain. They are known as the Tories as the Tories were the more conservative of the two main British parties pre-1900.  (Whigs became Liberal, who collapsed when Labour arose Tories changed to Conservative as time went on)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BigBeardedRed And yet you immediately believe that I am somehow wishing to wage war on these people.  I'm alright with legalising it but think that it shouldn't be encouraged as a profession is all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BunnyHeartedGG It's not just prostitution which is bad, and if anything there are much worse professions and different things that need banning (for example tobacco companies shouldn't exist). It stands out because it is easily abused and can be a hub for STDs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pawgliacci Missing my point but I guess it's hard to explain in small comments. Prostitution shouldn't be viewed as a career like healthcare or education for example, and people shouldn't go into it except for if they actually want to for the "work" or if they have to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kilatta The way you describe it is completely fine.  I'm not against rights - but encouragement into the profession shouldn't be a thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigBeardedRed Thanks for the detailed argument, because clearly male prostitutes don't exist and you can't be bothered to take it to a proper level of debate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MxChaoticGood Rights shouldn't be limited whatsoever.  I'm saying it shouldn't be encouraged.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elliana_now I do believe in legalisation.  But persuading especially intelligent graduates to do this drains from society.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kbohas Surprisingly for you and your hostile argument - I'm fine with legalising it.  What I mean is that university graduates and the such shouldn't consider it an option and it shouldn't be encouraged.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ACABra_Kadabra This is the third reply I've done and I'm quite lazy so I'll sum it up more succinctly:  Rights - yes But don't encourage university graduates and the such to even consider it a viable option.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BunnyHeartedGG Yeah I wish I could explain my views in more length but hey, character limit.  I'm more meaning it shouldn't be encouraged as a profession, workers shouldn't view it as an option if they are highly qualified.  Legalisation is fine, it's their choice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MxChaoticGood Then I agree with you up to an extent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yuhfrohweinyuh @HappyBuddha19 No, but I wasn't clear so sorry if you thought I was doing so.  I was making fun of those who believe such.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yuhfrohweinyuh @HappyBuddha19 Imagine not bothering to read between the lines...  I don't believe those things and frankly those who do shouldn't have the ability to state their opinions, I was instead characterising those who do believe such.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MxChaoticGood I'm not saying they shouldn't be allowed to - again it's their choice.  I'm saying people shouldn't view it as an opportunity and people shouldn't be encouraged to go into it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC Yes.  Those screeching "but jobs?!?!?" are yet to realise we're in the opening stages of a lengthy unemployment crisis and millions are already losing their jobs.  The wealth gap in America is larger than pre-revolutionary France, 1780s. Staggeringly disheartening.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SocialistMMA Sorry to burst your bubble and all, but the institution and system of Lebanon survives intact despite the government itself going.  Very unlikely an election will be held and the power sharing agreement controlled by Iranian influencers and associates will appoint a new puppet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shady07827964 @stevensizer2 The police officer that was filmed was courteous at the very least. The one off the screen was dismissed (rightly) by Butler as she was being aggressive and provocative. Every silver lining has a cloud, perhaps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedcruz Ah yes, because last time we tried printing money to fulfil this it went really well didn't it?  (cough cough 1923 Germany anyone?)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lilydont Inbuilt hatred for everything - which in this case would include the institution, which in the USA and Europe alike is largely centre-right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevensizer2 In this instance, both parties were in the wrong. If Butler hadn't been so opportunistic and hasty to argue with a very polite police officer and instead of shooting the messenger, aimed at the institution and cause, then maybe things would be different.  But her point is right.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>As per usual, the government attempts to pretend it has been in support of effective measures while brushing ineffective ones under the rug quietly.  6,000 contact tracers sacked and different methods used as Boris finally realises its a monumental cock up.  #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NHGreenVoter Two fundamental reasons. One - tactical voting. Sadly, unless you live in an area with a strong Green vote, you are just making a weaker majority for whoever gets in. Two - I don't live in America. I think this one is also pretty deal breaking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson Moral responsibility? Your many children? 20,000 care home deaths? Mass unemployment? Dominic Cummings? Billionaire bailouts? BA? House of Lords new peers?  You have yet to even grasp the concept of moral responsibility therefore lecturing us on it will not work or age well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NHGreenVoter Without an organised and universal new initiative (which this soon before the election is near impossible), Biden is sadly the least worst choice.  We aren't lacking in number but we're lacking in organisation. That's always been the left's problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bendoveranddoit No.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Strange how politicians, the press and workers fail to solve the problem of pay v productivity.  Since at least the last few decades of the 1900s, pay has stalled while productivity booms. The pandemic is proof: Jeff Bezos adds $71 billion to his name, tens of millions sacked...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wecanbebetter_ Of course.  It really depends on how a believer would treat atheism and agnosticism as concepts and how they would treat people...  Short answer: Unless one was shouting at me to go to hell for not praying every Sunday or what have you, then I don't see a reason why not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HappyBuddha19 I'm not a communist or anarchist.  Communism is a nice idea but never ends well...  Anarchists believe we should solve society by destroying it. Very strange take on it.  I believe in democracy but we need fundamental changes to it for it to survive uncorrupted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To those going for #NeverBiden...  This election will be at the very least a very strange one. If you don't vote, you help Trump. Biden may not be perfect or even desirable, but unless you want a repeat of the last 4 years but WORSE, then vote and get others to vote for Biden.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Isn't it strange how (as much as I think Butler may have been a bit opportunist) Butler being pulled over and complaining became something that Tories got really annoyed over?  Yet Cummings barrelling 400km up the M1 potentially blind with kids for a holiday in lockdown is fine?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alichat66 I would agree with you but the police lied twice in their reasoning: 1) They claimed it was a West Yorkshire number plate (which is currently in lockdown). This was false. 2) They next claimed that her rear windows were too tinted. This again was false.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@montie I'm sorry to seem like such a politically correct person, but have you actually looked into why both the Red Wall was partially penetrated and why Dawn was even stopped?  If you look carefully at the full interview it's far more than just lecturing on race...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesEFoster @Keir_Starmer I both completely understand why you would expect Starmer to do something like this and the move or rather lack of move from him in response.  Imagine the backlash by the press against him if he had. People turned against Labour by Tory scapegoats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I personally believe that we should keep politics out of sports and the like.  Hence #Wakefield not taking the knee shows they don't listen to the woke few out there hoping to influence and publicise as much as possible, and instead are just wanting to play the match.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThatTimWalker @BorisJohnson Two big problems.  One - Cummings is the puppeteer, not the puppet. He sacks people, not vice versa.  Two - the British public is too complacent and impatient to keep on an issue for longer than a week, and still votes Tory again and again.  Enabling cronies leads to cronyism...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawnButlerBrent, has it occurred to you to not use the race card? Maybe compare to Cummings - the racial bias is far less evident than the bias for the Tories and super rich.  Long gone are the days that Labour would stand up for workers and unions instead of identity politics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The "elections" in #Belarus are so obviously undemocratic that nobody was surprised when Lukashenko stated he got 90%+ of the vote, and that the opposition (rightly) stated they had won at the same time - with violence as the new background noise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawnButlerBrent, I think the last 10 years of Tory government is evidence to at least suggest this:  Identity politics does not work.  If you're going to gain back Parliament from the Tories after the longest stint in power since the 1980-90s, economy matters more than identity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TonyYorath I'm not saying it's necessarily definite and immediate - especially with Labour flailing about at war with itself and the press going all guns blazing to protect its ill-gotten gains.  But it's going to cause a political wave similar to the 1990s.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eliistender10 Conservatives don't represent you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brexit You'd think that Brexit was over already.  That's what Boris wants you to think, to avoid you from the unfolding of his rushed mess of a deal that both sides dislike.  Prepare your "I told you so"s when Brexit and Covid inevitably clash into an unholy mess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Scotland  Ironic how Boris is the one to lose the Union?  He's in the Conservatives and Unionists.  The UNIONIST party is about to be the cause of the breakup of the UNION.  What a bunch of absolute pillocks. World-beating in their lack of ability to do anything right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Newsnight  Once again, the #Tories seek for a scapegoat.  The Wheel of Failure! Who will it be? Will it be YOU? Immigrants, Scotland, the North, Eid, religion, Brexit, Keir Starmer, Jeremy Corbyn, China, Europe, poor people, take your pick - as long as it isn't them...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@f00n There are two possible scenarios and both are happening: 1) Those under 50, angered by lost jobs and no other ones, higher burdens, being priced out of housing and university and then higher taxes and bills begin to look at Labour as a way out 2) 2010s v2, Boris style<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@f00n @jeremycorbyn It's called Utorypia.  All who are rich think it's great, because if something bad happens then they panic for a few days then somehow money magically appears!  Apart from the fact that the rest of us carry the growing burden since the 2010s but oh well who cares about that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenecaRiots He's perceptive, intelligent and almost completely invulnerable from the press...  Only is he just another Tony Blair, or a real Labour candidate? My money's on somewhere between the two.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Olerbia New Labou-yeah not that. We all know what happened last time.  The British Social Democrats. Says what it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenecaRiots He's the new Labour leader. A little bit centrist but then we don't really know what he wants or is.  That's his ace card.  He is like the Biden-type of Britain, appealing because of the simple fact that he isn't Boris, without pointing out his policies for Boris to shit on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenecaRiots Yeah, I heard about that and knew he was a Jewish man so laughed.  They also can't try that one against Starmer, his wife is Jewish and his children are raised that way too. It's fun to watch the press and the Tories alike fail to pin down something, he's too smart for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hewentatthat Margaret Thatcher. Who said I had to choose one of them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenecaRiots They're technically right but not quite hitting the mark.  The reason is more deeply rooted: our press has the ability to sway ejections easily, and Corbyn has been among the worst affected for this.  However, they failed to gain a clear position on Brexit. This didn't help them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Conservatives set up a #NoCapitalistsUnder1k?  How childish. Their philosophy clearly states that only the top 1% can have any, only a true capitalist would know this.  Please nobody make a liberal one. They are the apologetic useless centre ground that nobody wants to deal with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenecaRiots Polls show that even in 2019, Labour had a majority over the Tories for those under 50 - the reason the Tories won was partly down to low turnout of the young (as the Tories knew that they can just refuse to help get voter turnout up to win)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NoComradesUnder1k I hope that this actually helps to interconnect and strengthen the left, rather than be a pointless trend.  This will likely seem like the latter to liberals and conservatives alike. But let's hope that we don't prove them right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you think about it, ageism is a stupid policy.  By angering all those under 40, you create  a massive hurdle. Blue Britain is turning British people red.  Raising a generation of Labours means that within a generation's time, we will see a giant shunt to the left. Fools.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can people please get it out of their heads that liberals are leftist?  They aren't. The American political system doesn't even have liberals, forget leftists.  Democrats - moderate conservatives Republicans - increasingly hard-line conservatives.  Not much of a choice there...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCMarkSimpson ... you mean it hasn't been compulsory there?  How can a country be BEHIND England in this? That's like being more incompetent than the President of the United States.  What a sad state of affairs, when major countries are spearheaded by corrupt mindless buffoons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Noticed how there's always another #Brexit where the EU would bow down to us and give us all their BMWs and we'd have infinite money and have a jolly old time like 1945?  Get over it. It's more like we're plunging off a cliff backwards on fire after 4 years of engine failure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The President of the United States, who wields the most power of any person globally, pronounces Thailand as Thighland.  This is in itself pitiful, but to paint the wider picture around it, it is deeply worrying and scary to say the least.  #Thighland @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JoeBiden  Never has a candidate had to go against such a bigoted blundering corrupt racist and his associates...  - Trump hasn't agreed to respect the election - Kanye admits his campaign was to hurt Biden - Trump seeks to lower turnout  Vote Biden if you respect democracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson Does #Grenfell ring any bells?  The reckless attitude of "thrift construction" is as per usual at the expense of the people there.  If he was told to build a ship, he wouldn't check for holes or weak points as that clearly wastes taxpayer money and time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#3Point5Percent  Studies show that with 3.5% of the population's active and sustained support, peaceful protests have never failed.  So let's use that to our advantage and gather up the few we have left who are aware of our government's nature and act against it. You can help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ToryCorruption  Can we stop calling the Tories incompetent? This misses the point: they are malicious and accountable for their actions.  Influence from Putin, donors? The new peers? The PPE scandal? Brexit? 50,000 Covid deaths? Expenses and bailouts?  This is deliberate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MalaveNoel There aren't enough characters in 10 tweets to list all the failed capitalist countries, particularly Conservative led, who have failed miserably in this pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So you're saying this is somehow larger than the fact that you ignored Russia putting bounties on your nation's troops lives or your constant and relentless interference in elections, influence from other countries and even saying you won't agree to the result if it's not a win?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump By getting rid of you? In which case, yes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NoComradesUnder1k  #COVID19 has proved that the right and centre are incompetent (albeit with exceptions) at leading their respective countries - the trademarks being the UK and US, with both being places of widespread corruption and incompetence.  That's why the left exists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NoComradesUnder1k  I'll get behind anyone as long as they don't look like a liberal or conservative in disguise.  No, this isn't to gain clout, this isn't what this would be for.  It's just one extra step to interconnecting the left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NoComradesUnder1k  Seems like a good idea to gather those of similar mindsets together so we are more of a force as a group.  So feel free to retweet or reply or just follow and I'll follow back, seen as we do need to make our voices louder.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@larrieb121 @Almudn1 That would be fine if Sturgeon hadn't then fully backed the findings and reductions in grades publicly, showing that she indeed agrees with the criteria shown.  By the way I am not saying the Tories are better - of course not. But one must criticise all leaders, not just one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just to highlight the incompetency: Trump: "Deaths are down in Arizona, Florida..." Him: "Down in Florida?"

<|startoftext|>@gazfitzgaz @MPIainDS Boris Johnson was residing Prime Minister and had been for several months when this was signed.

<|startoftext|>@michade1 @MPIainDS Lots of grumbling Brexiteers blundering about trying to find a scapegoat for the ineptitude of Tory MPs - they take months to read the deal they forced through Parliament as fast as possible, then blame Europe or Labour or minorities or whatever they can when they mess up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pablo45911752 @MPIainDS I have never heard such nonsense.  Labour voted against this, but Boris and his MPs last year voted it through.

<|startoftext|>@BelindadeLucy @MPIainDS The EU knew they could easily solve some of the problems left in the wake by Britain due to the sheer incompetence of British politicians.

<|startoftext|>R0 is a very crucial figure, albeit vague.  Using 900 as a benchmark for the UK, this could happen depending on our actions:  September 1: R0 0.5: 56 R0 0.9: 590 R0 1.1: 1328 R0 1.2: 1866 R0 1.5: 4500 And to those saying lockdown isn't working. Covid's usual R0: R0 3: 72,900<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Francis_Hoar Yes, but anything but 0 is a threat to our country and its people.  Even with 10 cases, if the R0 is 3, this becomes 30 daily in a week, 1000 daily in a month, 100000 in two months. This is about the R0 of #Covid19, hence why we needed lockdown, as it was rapid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guardian America has yet to grasp the very scale of this.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump No, the cases don't just vanish when you don't find out they exist. They just go unnoticed - and you cover a growing problem with a blanket.  Well, unless your complete ignorance results in the victim's death. In which case, yes  it has vanished.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wef Possibly, but may be the case that flu cases are documented as #COVID- leading to a reduction in flu cases (sometimes people can be infected with both, or have Covid symptoms without having it)  Still, good news coming out of an otherwise cataclysmic situation is always good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#COVIDIOTS Tories may actually have been half right when they say the public isn't sensible.  Protests against cloth to protect you from a deadly virus in #Berlin, many of them will get Covid in brutal sense of irony  Beaches full, causing new clusters and pointless Covid deaths<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Shielding ends just as the coronavirus epidemic begins to accelerate.  Not only have they spent months in isolation, but now they are exposed to the onset of a possible 2nd wave.  If they ask what protection they will get from Boris, this will be the reply: "We helped already."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Berlin Anti-life protests taking place. In December, nobody would have thought that people would protest against a thin layer of cloth to keep you from having a potentially life threatening virus or passing it to others. However, this seems to be the case for much of this year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@britainelects @OpiniumResearch For a normal Tory leader, these figures would be modest or a bit disappointing depending on the situation.  For the populist, poll-obsessed Boris, these figures show a slowly increasing majority of the public beginning to turn against him - despite divide and rule politics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClassicLearner Refusal to wear a mask is a form of natural selection.  Those so obsessed with their own civil liberties but failing to protest the actual democratic backsliding present in many Western nations so that they protest pieces of cloth used to stop virus transmission endanger society.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brixton  Those comparing the marches in Brixton to Nazi marches in 1938 are ignorant beyond comprehension.  I may not be the most intelligent of people, but at least I can safely say I don't mistake such a march as comparable to a 1930s-esque Nazist one - division doesn't work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xtophercook A repeat of the last 6 months with the magnitude turned up a few notches. The sequel nobody wanted from the producers that didn't do enough to stop it from happening...  #Covid19UK: Winter Edition - with 100% more economic and social devastation, featuring #BorisJohnson blunders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MySay15964328 I apologise for being vague but Twitter limits don't permit me to divulge into the full details.  What I mean is BLM seeks events like this to appropriate to their own cause more often than not, even when they are nothing to do with them - playing into the hands of the right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson  If Cummings permits you, may I ask of the following:  Have you considered giving NHS and care workers proper wages? These are the people who saved your life - yet you continue to show complete disregard for the hard work they do every day, like those before you...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CWhittaker_MP #CraigWhittaker  Your comment implying that ethnic minorities - particularly BAME and Muslim ones - are to blame for the rise in coronavirus due to higher levels of non-compliance are deplorable.  The people of Calderdale shouldn't have to stand for such divide-and-rule politics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#brightonbeach  Pathetic that the North goes through lockdown while they still piss about refusing to lock down beaches. It's a no brainer surely?  Someone please give @BorisJohnson a map and show him that Brighton is on the south coast, and point to the beach that needs closing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Brixton BLM seeks to take on government hypocrisy with hypocrisy of its own. As much as the substance is there, it is disguised in a thick veil of identity politics and self-entitlement. Focus on the real issues. Protest for people - not statues, defunding or opinion censorship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Covid19 #facemasks #coronavirus  WEAR A MASK.  I can't stress that enough.  If you care about people at all to the point you'd rather not cause their deaths - wear a mask. Don't be a selfish prick and don't contribute to misinformation that costs lives. It'll bite you back...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@britishbullybee @Chiaroscuro101 a) Not yet, we haven't got a vaccine. b) That's because the flu has never been subject to the scale of investigation that Covid-19 has. c) There are hundreds if not thousands of strains of the common cold and influenza, we would need this number of vaccines.  Get informed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not saying that she's in any way an effective MP - if anything this was coming for her, someone of repeated misconduct.  I'm saying that Labour's approach is one-sided to support the few who actively search for offense. Somehow "kill all men" isn't worthy of such controversy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Labour So Labour is sluggish at best in investigating antisemitism, racism, and refusing to back trade unions...  But when @RosieDuffield1 likes a tweet that is slightly controversial at most, everyone goes apeshit.  The woke few are increasingly powerful over the many.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guardian Don't sugarcoat this. "Prince Andrew raped a child" is far more accurate. Attributing "sex" with "rape" is about the same as attributing "receiving a gift" to "armed robbery".  #PrinceAndrew<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guardian #BorisJohnson #PrinceAndrew  The way things are going, I would genuinely not be surprised that even in the light of this, Boris would still try and give him some form of peerage or something to reward him for distracting us from his lacklustre leadership.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattHancock #Bradford #Manchester  #Kirklees  For any of those struggling to work out whether it's okay to meet people outside your household somewhere, it's alright as long as there's an ATM machine, and as long as it's a place where you spend money. So not at home, but the pub's fine...?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pritipatel @BorisJohnson A largely inconsequential number compared to the 120,000 your administration sacked in the last decade.  Stop gas lighting the public and face up to the fact that you've failed yourselves and the country, and caused 50,000 families to lose loved ones. #COVID__19 #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheReal58052060 @MattHancock Similar to another comment - I don't mind that it's now, I mind that they have once again done it in such a lazy and unorganised fashion, leaving obvious ambiguities and vague restrictions.  This causes a lack of trust - which in turn costs lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@medusainsummer @MattHancock I get why you think I'm against the lockdown - I'm not. It's the fact that they announced it in such a slap-dash nature over Twitter 2 hours beforehand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson #COVID19 #lockdownextension #Muslims  Boris: "Hope you have a good Eid! In completely separate news, here's a new lockdown for these areas which have very large ethnic minorities, so no family visits. Don't like it? Then go vote Labour in 4 years or run away to Scotland."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump #USA Surprise surprise. Reality finally hits as Trump realises he's done for in November, so he makes a last ditch effort to postpone democracy.  The world stands with America when it says this in response: No.  #Trump #COVID19 #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattHancock #Christmas  Would they really have done this on December 24 at 10pm?  No matter what your political leanings are or how this affects you, this is wrong. At best, it is an act of sheer incompetence and ignorance. At worst, it is blatant racism against Muslims. Appalling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattHancock #ChristmasEve  Imagine: It's the 24th of December, 2020, at about 9pm. You've wrapped the presents, you're preparing to see family in the morning.  Then Hancock decides to make some vague effort to say that's banned in your area. This is what it's like.  Shambolic. Devastating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage Can't you take a leaf out or Tommy Robinson's book and go off to the USA? I'm sure they'd appreciate your thinly veiled racist nonsense there. #Farage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattHancock Government says in the North, you shouldn't meet individual family members or friends indoors...  But going to the pub with, shopping with hundreds around you or having a barbecue is alright?  I imagine you'll blame us for this when it goes wrong too. #Bradford #Covid19 #Kirklees  https://t.co/tOY1xgbOgw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Grow up. You're the President of the United States of America. You act like you've had an argument with a 6 year old.  When will you learn to take responsibility for your actions as President? Your actions will cause people to suffer. @realDonaldTrump @GOP #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afneil The reason why they're trending below average is because more people died than normal, and many had conditions that could (not would) have caused their deaths later on - hence the medium-term slump. Statistics also show 3 year decline without #Covid19 too.  Hope this was of use.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson warns us of the second wave that we all knew was probable months ago.  You don't stop outbreaks properly along the Pennines, this is what happens. You can't sit and watch the infection rate creep up and then blame Europe for everything.  #COVID19 #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meanwhile, Bradford has recorded AT LEAST 500 deaths. It is almost certain that deaths of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales (total pop. near 10 million) are lower than Bradford (total pop. near 0.5 million).  And it's not even a priority area. #COVIDー19 #COVID19 @BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No wonder the Scots want independence - they have managed to halt the process of time.  Cummings has the ultimate rebuttal: Boris doesn't know how to tell time either. You wouldn't know from his policies, he thinks it's May 2016. #Covid19 #Scotland #BorisJohnson  https://t.co/kX98CXidng<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Highest Saturday #Covid19 UK cases and deaths for a month.  Let's not forget these numbers are the unnecessary deaths of people. At the rate of 148 a day, that is 1 dead in 10 minutes.  A film would end after 6 people die. Sleep while 54 people die.  @Conservatives, wake up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Government claimed that no country had a working track and trace app - now allows usage of this non-existent track and trace app to the British people going to Germany.  Definitely doesn't exist, there clearly is no country with one...  Germany, anyone?  #BorisJohnson #Covid19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's put #Covid19 and opening schools into view.  There are 8,820,000 pupils in the UK. Let's go for a very low rate of 5% infected. 441,000 children sick. About 10,000 experience severe symptoms. If a death rate was 0.5%, 2,200 children would die in just the UK.  Really, Boris?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealDMitchell Woah, we must solve this completely separate issue with £30 billion that we don't have!  While we're at it, let's - on a completely separate issue - reduce public spending while saying that we're increasing it by... £7 or 600 billion? Who cares, we'll blame someone else anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump a) these countries had largely taken care of their outbreaks, whereas the US outbreak is in full force; b) opening schools caused localised outbreaks and increases in r0 - which for them, is maybe 100 cases, in the US could be 10000+  Misleading facts don't work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Keep them silent and indoors and we'll all be happy, @realDonaldTrump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson, why are you going to make #NHS workers pay to park? These are the people who saved your life, no amount of clapping can repay that - this is shameful. What is wrong with you?   Who's next? Teachers? Stop targeting others for your mistakes, and do your job for once.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Covid19 @BorisJohnson Good job Boris. Second wave nearly inevitable, probably more devastating than the first - except we won't even have a time where the virus is in retreat for long...   Who are you going to blame this time? You can't get away with the deaths of thousands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Conservatives #Covid19 On March 27, 331 Tory MPs voted to move 15k people from care homes to hospitals, untested.  Now, these same MPs are blaming the very care workers who work to save lives. This is appaling and beyond reason. Take responsibility for something for once, Boris.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson #COVID19 Boris once again flounders under pressure.  Stating that "its all their fault" to hard working care home workers is out of order. It's demeaning insulting, deeply cruel and shocking. How a government can get away with such statements defeats me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdwardJDavey I support you but this wasn't the way. Don't publicise such a move, without backing it up with further action.  You can do so much more than just report him, as annoying a person as he is.  Step up to the podium and do MORE.  #nigelfarage #coronavirus #SuperSpreaderSaturday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage The right knows they can do whatever they want with few consequences; Farage, Cummings, Johnson's father. The earliest he could have arrived was 13 days ago. This means he didn't quarantine for 2 weeks. Apathetic and pathetic at the same time. #Covid19 #nigelfarage #4thofJuly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kanyewest oh no<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@10DowningStreet @BorisJohnson #coronavirus  Don't meet inside but do but only with six people but only two however you can meet outside but only inside but 2m apart only 1m apart only wearing face masks not wearing protection inside outside don't do anything.  Good job, as always, Tories.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@10DowningStreet The old famous line: Stay 2m apart but don't but stay apart but you can go to 1m but you can't but you should but don't.  Clear as usual, Boris.  #coronavirus #BorisJohnson #uk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Isn't it ironic that you pretend to support democratic processes and yet repeatedly pass off attempts to fix the very... interestingly structured American political systems as schemes against your party? At least try this democracy fad. #DonaldTrump #2020GeneralElection<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If we are to beat #COVID19, we need to actively, as a people, defy the opening of the country. Boris wants us to go to the pub and forget all about their failures, just as his father is found flying to Greece. We can't let him play around with 68 million people. #uk #Conservative<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ChinaVsWorld #HongKong China is a foe to be reckoned with. They waited patiently for the world to fall apart and quietly yet blatantly seized democracy. Who among us could say they'd even last this long? The world must unite against this rising aggressor, for Hong King's people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Russia's sudden solidification of a tyrant's political position is as worrying as it was inevitable. Putin won't be going away until he's either in his 80s or dead, and his successor will be no different. Democracy is in serious danger. #Russia #Putin2036<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson #uk #NewDeal And here we are. £7 billion, most of which is spread out and already announced, has suddenly become "£600 billion" in the PMQs. Will the government face up to the fact this New Real is nothing but a small repackaging and revise it for actual usage?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PMQs #BorisJohnson #uk @BorisJohnson @Conservatives After yet another display of lies and diversions, Boris must answer: Is the situation in Bradford really sorted, or are we seeing a repeat Leicester? If its really sorted, why is it the second highest in England?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Covid19UK #DonaldTrump #BorisJohnson Listen. USA: You have failed. No other words, you have caused a spike and seem to relentlessly seek openings to other nations who have worked hard to eradicate it. UK: Don't do that. Anything but that. Don't follow Trump, lives are at stake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson Figures show you need £7 billion now spent to REPAIR the damage you Tories have caused. Don't expect us to thank you for one seventh of these repairs like the Thatcherist apathetic figureheads you are.  #BorisJohnsonMustGo #COVID19 #LabourParty #KeirStarmer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump ... doesn't even survey his polls because they're so dismal that it depresses his voter base by saying them. So much so that 5% of his own party dislikes him. This is the Republican Party we're talking about, where disagreeing results in being sacked. #DonaldTrump #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>... I think he genuinely doesn't even have the intelligence to say the word "stupid". Wow. This man is the President of the United States.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For July 4th, UK: DO NOT go out. DO NOT listen to people who only care for the economy, not our lives. DO NOT fall for the Tories' attempts to cover their failures.  This won't end, don't contribute to the second wave. Don't listen to Boris, he's clueless. #Covid19 #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
