<|startoftext|>@SocialRepose Satan approves  https://t.co/QnuwzQ26j5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, I am not getting anything done anytime soon, this dentist hit me with $20k.  I think this particular dentist has predatory sales tactics.  I've never seen a dentist act like that and it made me very uncomfortable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@portadoramende @SocialRepose Yeah fuck God's plan, don't say that shit minutes after someone dies.  Like can you wait till they are cold before you bring that bullshit up?  https://t.co/JvIwuxgEB1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First 2020 took my gallbladder, now my teeth... Seriously 2020 can't end soon enough... I still have a spleen and an appendix that are in fairly good condition, I'd like to keep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So it's the dreaded dentist day.  Chemo, car wrecks, and plenty of facial trauma have destroyed my teeth.  So I am probably be saying goodbye to the trainwreck in my mouth, I mean all my remaining natural teeth very soon.  I'm not ashamed but  https://t.co/aODfyAk3Gs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gothra69 @SocialRepose I light it but the pieces he used velcro to the headband weren't necessarily well placed and didn't show up well behind the thorn crown.  But overall it's awesome, love the mask!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@portadoramende @SocialRepose I can remember the exact moment that God became a fairy tale to me. Dec. 3, 2001, 10:43 PM.  I wasn't particularly religious but at that moment someone said it was "all part of God's plan" yeah fuck that, fuck all the hype when you're dead your dead period full stop<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SocialRepose My mother never cried, got divorced, the dog died, her sister and mother died... Yeah because she has no heart or soul.  Crying is for exploiting the weak... It's no wonder I'm such a fucked up human being.  https://t.co/Pye38t1CBp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I say, not today Satan, she's like oh, you think you can tell me what to do, muhaha, I'll show you!  I now have cat hair in my sinuses.  https://t.co/2caMqCk6Np<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martyrabkin Sorry, it's a stressful day  https://t.co/iY5OiD3QWK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martyrabkin I can't afford slow like the majority of Americans.  Slow is a luxury for people that have time and money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, just had surgery, yay then a few days after I broke a tooth clean down the middle excruciating.  Can we all agree that dental care isn't a fucking luxury and if you're broke the only option is to suffer is not even remotely ok?!  There's zero options for me where I live.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Things I didn't know we're possible but actually are part 97.  You know you are seriously twisted when you search something on pornhub that have zero results.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BottomRightRich Just listen to her laugh... The serotonin boost will hit immediately  https://t.co/mLhljXvYBw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BottomRightRich Being selfish isn't a crime, it's a life skill that keeps us alive.  We are born with it built into us for survival not as a thing to later be used as a shame flogger by loved ones.  If you are breathing air currently you're selfish and nothing is wrong with that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BottomRightRich Yeah, it happens but learn from it and move on and don't let yourself ever fall into their shoes.  Value your relationships, nurture them, and build a new family because blood isn't always thicker than water.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I'm home minus a gallbladder and $8700... So I guess Thanksgiving dinner or any dinner for the foreseeable future is off, #HappyThanksgiving<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yay, hospital, fun fun  https://t.co/LppEgYevqq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know what isn't fun? Having a seizure while mowing your yard, knocking yourself out, and having the neighbors find you and hour later while your husband is home.  So yeah that's how my day went.  https://t.co/dt8LSdc0Yd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iseemoutofplace I'm sorry but I was looking for the perfect gif as a response and this came up... I giggled, I hope it makes you laugh even though it holds no relevance to your tweet  https://t.co/fUlGc1CecD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I cracked, I mean sheered the entire side of it off, my right maxillary cuspid (canine).  So every single none implant tooth I have is broken at this point.  I've gotta say I am loving mask more and more everyday.  https://t.co/rdSVehS40u<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BottomRightRich Speaking from experience, the past is never as good as we remember it.  We romanticize it because it's comforting. But we can't move backward... It gets so much better when you start looking forward and not backward.  Romanticize your future, the dividends pay better<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Satan demands that you love yourself for 5 solid minutes today.  If not she will curse you by having your Mom call and con you into helping her with lawn work.  So just do it or else!  And warn everyone you know, she'll come for them too!  https://t.co/VWC9Ut79DU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoRestForEvil It works with OJ too.  I used to bartend in college (strawberry, oj, pineapple, heavy cream with dark rum) everyone called it the Pepto-Bismol shake because of the color, excellent for hangovers  https://t.co/UlVIwszyiA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NoRestForEvil Edit: Wendy's Frosty fucking autocorrect<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoRestForEvil Blender ice pineapple juice a little heavy cream or whip cream... Add vodka, actually almost any alcohol work, taste like Disney Dole whip with fun fun juice. If you want it like a wendy's front add a lot of heavy cream.  https://t.co/rjcA3SvSyk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imjustyelah This is so stupid but it helps me so much, if my anxiety is causing me not to be able to talk or hold things, I sing my A,B,C, or mary had a little lamb, focusing on every single syllable over and over until I am in control again, it's borderline creepy but it works for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Suzyspeers Have you tried snorting instant coffee grounds yet?  I absolutely do not suggest it but if you get to that point we are on the same level of caffeine addiction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouTube Youtube is like after last year's utter and complete failure we are not even going to try to make 2020 sound like it's worth remembering.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Mitch Mcconnell - â€œ... we also need to fund the government..." yeah the American tax payer has been paying your bill for 7 terms - shut the fuck and sit yo ass down!

<|startoftext|>@iseemoutofplace I don't know yet.  But I am a big girl if I suddenly start losing weight it is not a good thing.  The would be round 3, fuck 2020, seriously fuck it hard with no lube up the ass.  I just hope no one says I look great... I might punch them in the face.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So did anything happen anywhere in the US yesterday outside of the election?  I can't even find a traffic report, just a lot of people talking a lot of circles but not actually saying anything look at you #FoxNews #ABCNews #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just waiting for politicians to stop using the election as an excuse to continually fail American families... Repeatedly. #Stimuluscheck #DumpTrump  https://t.co/MfWvhTt8B3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AEHSINO Sounds like every job I had before the age of 20.  A tell as old time.  Remember to take a deep breath...

<|startoftext|>@SocialRepose You will always be someone's villain, there's no way around it.  You will never survive into adulthood without hurting someone.

<|startoftext|>@SocialRepose @Gothra69 If love is rational it's after being with someone for 10 years, the first 7 years are a trail period for you to show your ass and if they didn't run away claiming you're the devil incarnate...

<|startoftext|>So #RIPRBG but wow look how absolutely no one cares about getting a #STIMULUSPACKAGE together suddenly it's all about Trump trying to appoint someone so I guess millions of needy American's can just wait for a #stimuluscheck while Trump throws a tantrum  https://t.co/1BsurOyDs4<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hardcore reality check: They say only the good die young.

<|startoftext|>@solospirit231 @SeagerFever @moshwithtyler @lunastellafae I asked you because I don't really know who to ask... My friends kind of treat me like I'm too innocent and couldn't possibly understand.  This is why I'm asking but I can't seem to talk to anyone that doesn't jump down my throat or laugh at me.  It's frustrating<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@solospirit231 @SeagerFever @moshwithtyler @lunastellafae I actually didn't know the spelling change thing, this is probably why I don't know these things.  Why can't I make a statement without people assuming I'm being snarky?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@solospirit231 @moshwithtyler @lunastellafae Sorry, I was just asking not attacking.  I was just curious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@solospirit231 @moshwithtyler @lunastellafae But how does that work? It's like saying do as I say not as I do.  The word makes me cringe like the word moist.

<|startoftext|>I just want to make my stance very clear.  Cheating on someone isn't abuse, maybe emotional abuse, but it's not being punched and kicked.  Stop telling people you were abused because your partner cheated on you.  Stop destroying people's lives because things didn't work out.  https://t.co/E6a010SbFJ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@itsshane2019 @musich0e420 I'm not justifying... Let me guess you are below the age of 30...

<|startoftext|>@itsshane2019 @musich0e420 God I hate it when people think it's their job to crusade against people they don't know.... that have exactly nothing to do with it thinking they are doing some great crusade against the "bad guy"... That's so damn annoying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsshane2019 @musich0e420 The only people that deserve to judge him are the people involved.  If he didn't do it to you... You don't know the 100% truth.  It takes two for a romantic disaster to happen.  I guess it's a lesson you learn with age.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So she's in the doggo hospital overnight due to dehydration but no word yet how serious her condition is.  I've had dogs my whole.  I trained dogs my whole life.  I should be used to the possibility of losing her but... I'm SO not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I'm about to bounce my house note to take my dog to the vet.  She's my service dog (seizure)... She's 7.  I know dogs aren't going to live forever but service dogs aren't just dogs, their children.  I'm tweeting to keep myself from full on panic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am laying in my living room floor with my dog. She has a blockage and can't eat or drink.  I can't afford a vet but I am worried sick and I don't want to lose my dog because... I can't afford care for her because of Corona virus shut down.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I CAN NOT tolerate Nicky Minaj and or Cardi B... They are perpetually reenforcing the cliche of all women are gold diggers and profit from it.  Please, if you value your life, do not try to enlighten me about their deeper meaning, it will not go down well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New meds are very effective but the side effects are extreme.  It's either take meds so I can feel my legs and feel horrible in every was the flu hasn't figured out yet or, don't take meds, can't walk and basically hate life because I can't do shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoreyMooney_33 So did I, I'm not impressed by this one but it took quite some time so..  https://t.co/ZcclY6Rj03<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoreyMooney_33 @marilynmanson Oh my God, good I'm old<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoreyMooney_33 It's not really art if you aren't suffering<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoreyMooney_33 Probably because he is taking sometime for himself and not really using social media<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember #SteveIrwin? I met him about 15 yrs ago. He was exactly like he was on TV and there's absolutely no one like him. I just had a breakdown when I found, #Crikey #itstheIrwins, God that's amazing family. Bravo!  https://t.co/n32d8PupdK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's 572,310,000 seconds 18 years and you are always the person I look for in other people and fail. You didn't lose me, I lost you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's been 6,624 days since you've been gone and this song still stops my heart, I would kill to hear you sing it again.  https://t.co/coFD8wdp0R<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so not joking. Someone left their grocery list in the cart, it says, wine (expensive looking), shit to eat with wine, condoms... Seriously I just missed my soul mate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty is NOT the rent you pay to exist in the world as a woman.  You are under no obligation to get dressed up for anyone except yourself and Ryan Renolds of course<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've forgotten my mother's laugh, I can't recall her smile, she's not dead she chooses to not interact with me. I guess I'll never really know why.  There are fates worse than death.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I wonder how many people are alone tonight because apparently as we age friends aren't really needed, well, until you are starring at the wall taking shots of patron alone.  https://t.co/OZLfEVappB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm incredibly "heavy"(emotionally)right now. I'm done being poke at to see if this or that will work. I'm just starring at my meds and thinking, how am I still alive.  Maybe it's 17 prescriptions, but I don't want this life like this anymore. My life my choice.  https://t.co/ENfm3JZ09K<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I have to read one more article about life changing morning rituals that are basically wake up early and drink lemon water I'm going to scream.  Do bloggers get together and decide how much they can plagiarise each other's shit but still sounding innovative?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@trentjeffrey Sorry, I'm a shitty person, if I haven't pissed you off yet trust me this is a preumptive apology.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sublime_sorrows @SocialRepose Damn straight, Scorn's general well being is his captors only responsibility. As anytime Riche could wake up with Scorn screaming, off with his head... In cat. I should send Scorn a gift pack to show my loyalty to his awesomeness.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NarleeTweets @YouTube I know you're gone and I hope you are peace. I wished I'd have known you, your videos clearly give an accurate of mental illness.  You needed people that were supportive and patient. I can't help but feel somehow connected to your story because it's like mind  https://t.co/XucBNHM6ce<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoreyMooney_33 Same<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had no idea how bad ass #30secondsfromMars is... it's right up there with #breakingbenjamin and that's saying something.  Even the videos are epic not to mention #jaredleto is the hottest thing since molten lava.  Now I want a Joker Harley musical<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SocialRepose Ouch, that sucks.  I totally understand it though.  Take it from some random old lady, family sucks hard, but in the end you will miss them...  Time waits for no one and shit happens... people die... people get sick... don't wait for too long like I did.  https://t.co/qQyYbGEuEf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it just me or is #Netflix on a #suicide movie/show kick?  Watching #BirdBox and thinking how everyone said #13ReasonsWhy was encouraging teen suicide... and I'm just like so basically the whole of Netflix is basically encouraging suicide... Suicide isn't entertainment  https://t.co/040bx9sbTs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've never heard this song, how is that even possible? God I needed to hear it right now.  Thirty Seconds To Mars - Rescue Me (Official Music Video)  https://t.co/Y2fMzqGsGA via @YouTube<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guess what I got for christmas?  A bricked cell phone (ok that is kind of my fault) and my laptop screen some how disconnected from the keyboard... by itself, it wasn't dropped, nothing happened to it, I opened and it just came apart.  So I proceed to getting drunk in an epic way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still can't get my tattoo, Nerve damage is still a serious problem but one sweet sweet day I will get the tattoo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone noticed but didn't mention my scar and the discomfort was palatable.  They think that's the worst part of my story but it's not, in retrospect that was relatively easy... Can I just sleep until the new year?  https://t.co/s0FdvYt1jm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well I'm glad it's over.  I didn't come out unscathed and spent an entire 24 hours fake normal while inside I was screaming, crying, and hating every little thing that might have contributed to my cluster fuck life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder if I'll ever enjoy the holidays ever again. If something sincerely fucked up is going to happen to me it's always during the holidays. I can't remember what it was like because it's been 25 years since everything went sideways.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I woke up with this in my head. I love you like winter. The snow and icicles beautifully hide everything that's dead underneath. Yeah, that's odd and really creepy even for me.  https://t.co/0bOarFUIFn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When or more over why did suicide become a option? Life is hard, high school teaches you that. Does life get easier after high school? Not even remotely and if you think a school bully is bad wait till it's your employer. There will always be bullies, buck up buttercup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cyberbullying didn't exist then but what I went through was just as bad. Parents need to step up and teach their kids how to stand up for themselves. Schools can't fix it, it's plaques every student of every generation. Your child isn't the only child being bullied.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is it with kids these days? EVERYONE is a victim of bullying but bullies are never named. Not every teen suicide is from being bullied. I was tormented through high school but I never went home crying or threatening suicide, that was even an option.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holidays when you are shunned by your parents sucks. Depression is on full tilt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cardi B - Money  Is the most offensive music video I've seen in a long time. Half naked chicks saying money buys happiness. Youtube doesn't like #mercykill by @SocialRepose, standards are whack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are few things that make me nostalgic but the perfect teacup reminds me of my grandmother that come hell or high water had tea at 3pm everyday.  https://t.co/gJV34wNidV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@s8n The afterlife doesn't exist but if it did I'd have to go to hell because that's where all my peeps would be which would be one "hell" of a party.  https://t.co/WMp3d4ChEz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do not understand why YouTube demonetized social reposes videos but yet I've just watched four hours of videos relating two ignorant people physically fighting. How is that okay? @SocialRepose @Suzyspeers @Sublime_sorrows @Gothra69 @CoreyMooney_33<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Empathy is a fickle thing. I'm so empathic it's literally painful to be around people, I take pride in the fact that I honestly care about people regardless who they are. No one ever notices that about me until my zero fucks given policy is in affect and the I'm a narcissist  https://t.co/jzrSY01Ozs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate this. I have the physical capacity to go out and do something but my mind is flooded with more thoughts than I can process so I can't figure out what I should do so I'm just starring at the wall overwhelmed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's been a rough couple days.  My mind keeps wondering into the dark abyss where everything is a question, guestions that have no answers so all the pain rushes into fill the empty answer less void with lies. It's hard to breath when you aren't even safe with yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SocialRepose @tuva_bergstrom  https://t.co/eaNl3JF7BW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well I failed so hard and it's only 10 AM. I'm so over this. I rarely think... Well this is just pathetic... In reference to myself but this is seriously embarrassingly sad.  https://t.co/7OKI559RgJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gothra69 @SocialRepose I remember when I had mine removed I didn't remember shit for three days... Doctors were a little more lax on handing out the oxy back then.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Everyday I hear people say how much they want to die and I try to encourage and listen. But FFS when was the last time someone asked how I'm doing? Everyday I could actually died from organ failure, it's miserable, it's a legit reason to want to die but I'm like  https://t.co/lOsIlx3NNu<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SocialRepose Hell in 10 days nothing that happened today is going to matter. I tend to think in reverse, 10 years ago I wasn't supposed to be alive now... How did that happen?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have you ever listened to someone that is so ignorant that you have to threaten them with violence to shut the fuck up. Their stupid yes, but it physically painful to listen to the sound of words coming out of their mouths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People gave me some flack but they left before she returned. She was so relieved, she just half smiled at me... I'm the only person that would do something. I haven't been doing so great myself and I thought he'll always be young and sweet, I can't blame him.  https://t.co/HU8nY07ldQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They were sobbing and making a scene which upset his mother even more. She had to step out, she knew as well as I did how these kids treated her son. Well I'm that bitch that's going to say something. "If you are a student at .... Get the fuck out, now"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I went to a friend's child's funeral yesterday, it was suicide. I knew this kid had no friends and randomly stopped by to walk my dogs just to have something to do. His wake set fire in my soul. All these kids from his school showed up acting like they were best friends.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Being there for someone isn't a part time job and it has a 24/7 label. It's normally unnoticed by the masses but it really matters that person. If you want out leave don't do that obligatory friendship thing, that's the worst feeling ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know what I'm sick of? You are not alone. As I look around, bitch please, this is as alone as it gets. I dislike these posers that might have spoke to someone once and then tell everyone how hard they tried to help. Fuck you! Go sell that shit to a teenager.  https://t.co/qzHFW4zpzJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SocialRepose It's not the worst option. At least you can see that you need help. But they aren't magic, be patient and make sure you know what to expect  https://t.co/NumR10JRi2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why am I awake? I'm just filtering air. I know I should But I don't Because I know it won't change I'm wrapped in cellophane I'm not pretending anymore I am cold and empty I always have been Now leave, just like everyone else<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mellowdy9 @StoryAvery @GreysABC George the awkward obviously not straight brother I never had but desperately wanted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well when I fuck up I do it on full tilt and wake up 13 hours later to my brother telling me how fucked up his life is. I'm just starring at him thinking, wow I really am invisible. I'm just like you did that shit to yourself, am I supposed to feel sorry for you?  https://t.co/ABG0NbaOke<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Gothra69 @SocialRepose @Sublime_sorrows Really? I feel like I couldn't get his nose right... But hey when you are using colors aliens from other galaxies can see, things get real interesting and difficult.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate it. But I've re done it at least 8 times. So... @SocialRepose @Gothra69 @Sublime_sorrows I need validation too you know, I'm just as shallow and despondent as every 16-30 year old out there. LoL  https://t.co/o7ARKaI8mN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've been sober 12 years today, I should be proud right? But I'm not because that drug killed nearly every friend I had and now Fenanyl is killing their kids.

<|startoftext|>My contempt charges were dropped, thank God. The judge was like... Someone needed to say it but this isn't a jury case so you are off the hook, but please remember your place...

<|startoftext|>I loved my job even though danger was ever present. Today I testified today for the 3rd time on the same case. I got fined for contempt because this pussy smiled at me, on the stand my composure slip.... What you think you can rape and kill your daughter and live<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FFS I haven't slept in so long I'm having seizures and everyone is like just go lay day. I'm like are you seriously saying that? In 52 hours that had occurred to me jackass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sleep and I broke up again.  https://t.co/0gs7kcoyVo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The last 3 days have been the definition of difficult. It got very dark and twisty in my head and honestly that doesn't bother me anymore. It's when things start working out better than expected that really freaks me out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's been 15 years since I had to play with these demons, I'm tried... I'm losing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't have to keep fighting just so everyone can just walk away. I trust people, I love people unconditionally, and I am always the one left on my knees in my tears. I just don't have to...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DBmythical @SocialRepose Happy birthday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gothra69 @CoreyMooney_33 Facebook is dying a long brutal death<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so glad everyone else decided to have a break down, it really distract me from my perpetual self-loathing that normally goes a little to the dark and twisty side which can be detrimental to my health.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I just walked in on my boyfriend holding a very large knife crying... Houston we have a problem. I've always been the one struggling with mental illness, god am I contagious?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It sucks how much other people tear me down and how quickly they do it without flinching. I don't understand hatefulness so no matter who it's directed at I absorb it like a sponge. Now mind mind has shifted to completely deepest darkest depths of my depravity, thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So my new medication is working fucking awesomely... I've been so productive today I'm creeping myself out.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CoreyMooney_33 Now that's what your definition of hypocrisy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tomorrow is the 17th anniversary of the death of what I thought was my forever and always. I wonder if I'll ever not feel like it's happening all over again. Maybe next year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gucciorchids I totally understand<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GingerM55976992 Those didn't work out very well for me in the long run. The vegetables go bad so quick and stuff constantly showed up damaged. I tried hello fresh, blue apron, and a local organics service<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkoEFNiMsaPnOtK @SocialRepose Using suicide as a method of manipulation is 1 of 6 required traits for BPD.

<|startoftext|>@SkoEFNiMsaPnOtK @SocialRepose I was talking about the guy that threatened to kill himself if you left. No Richie is obviously an introvert and doesn't mind it mostly.

<|startoftext|>Guys, I'm not mean or condescending. If you are going to talk about ABUSE, you need some amount of conviction. Abuse isn't a this "clique" thing to sling around for views.

<|startoftext|>@SkoEFNiMsaPnOtK @SocialRepose So you don't want to talk about credentials, you experience, or how you "know" how abuse works... I'm glad we had this chat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkoEFNiMsaPnOtK @SocialRepose Your tweets are solely a bit "exposing" people...  https://t.co/TeYceuUdBm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkoEFNiMsaPnOtK Really. How exactly do you know how abuse works... I'm all about talking about the differences between abuse and psychological trauma... I have tons of experience, a Masters degree and 17 years of law enforcement experience and It still happened to me, tell me more...  https://t.co/CdOpEDd1RC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkoEFNiMsaPnOtK Wait you are doing it social repose... So... You don't like it when someone does it to you. I'm looking because I wanted to know if I was dealing with a child or adult... It's not about creepin... I don't taunt children<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkoEFNiMsaPnOtK @SocialRepose But you don't want the actual truth you want drama, you won't expect anything different than what you already believe is truth  https://t.co/NsSitNikoD<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkoEFNiMsaPnOtK @SocialRepose Oh he'll no. I'm not muting you. You want me to agree and I'm telling you, no. Your response only proves the point you demand answers you have zero claim to and those answers don't  even matter you want to argue for the sake of arguing...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Black latex isn't exactly easy to get out of hair... Totally learned that the hard was tonight.  So amazed how little I had to explain our costumes, anti-Jaclyn, I thought I was being original...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SocialRepose @YouTube It's a catch 22 situation damned if you do damned if you don't bleed for your art. People think art is something you do but if you are ant artist you ARE the pulse of your art. Don't do anything half as* put your whole as* into or don't do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Suzyspeers I actually didn't watch it while it was still airing on public TV. I'm a binge watcher. No shame I think I watched all of Heroes in a week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someone asked me about my suicide attempt and I recoiled. I don't know if sharing it is really beneficial at this point. What do you think?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So I've been working on the same piece for a month and just chunked the 8th version.  Pretty sure I'm a masochist... YouTube the birthplace of procrastination and self-loathing.  https://t.co/VkxD5oT1aG<|endoftext|>
