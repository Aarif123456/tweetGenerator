<|startoftext|>@tlesam Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lollardfish @AlexAnotherOne When he gets out of prison<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ciceruac I think so: public health, especially after #COVID19 has to be priority number one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To buffer our institutions we need: #ElectoralReform, #JudicialReform, the re-drawing of lines between government and law enforcement, new rules for politics and social media, and on and on. This is something Biden *can* do. But we have to keep him to it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What #Biden can do, is buffer our institutions - which took a beating by Trump, but have mostly held up. The US system (we now know) is deeply vulnerable, when the threat comes within the White House, rather than from the outside. This will only get worse in the age of #BigData<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nicoblar 😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can #Biden take us forward? Probably not. More likely it will come from grassroots organizing. In fact, the great silver lining of all this is that democratic engagement was *so* impressive this year .. !!! .. The key is to keep this up between elections, not merely during them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The message is a sobering one, because we on the left like to believe in the Manichean myth: that Dems are Good, and Trumpists are Evil. But Democrat complicity with neo-liberalism is unsustainable; as are platforms based on cosmetic rather than structural change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The main takeaway from the election is that while Trump lost, #trumpism is resilient. The fact that Trump got 70 million votes is arresting; as are #GOP pick-ups in the house and senate. This is something to grapple with, not push away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There will be many autopsies of #Election2020. This one from @ClareMalone is really excellent ... A reminder that elections only do so much, that deep structural change is needed to deal with our ideological divide, our racial animus, our inequality.    https://t.co/wt2t5lBwXg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samuelmoyn @AntonJaegermm That’s a hard question. As a political EMOJI, sadly this is the best we can do: 😅<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dmg320 Hi! Yes - these maps are great. Much more precision ... although still no way to scale ideological divergence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeremiahWJohn Yes. And that the other party would go up in flames.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hispeedtourist Yes. Yes, or at least this one doesn’t. Would be interesting to see one that can.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanCassino Yes- precisely. It tries to overcome the nature of our system; but this is precisely the problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Point is: maps like these are very valuable. But we have to be careful how we read them. To me this suggests that dem/GOP voters are geographically interspersed. But this doesn’t mean their any less ideologically divergent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed. The red/blue dichotomy is unhelpful. But making all states blur into purple undercuts the fact of division: purple here just means equal parts red and blue. But that is *still* polarised. Purple does not mean anyone voted for a middle road, because none exists.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This whole thread is brilliant - bravo @esdebruin ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For those who don’t already know about her, @staceyabrams is a national treasure. If Biden wins the #election we owe it in so many ways to her ... she is as extraordinary, as Trump is repugnant. Great piece by @jelani9:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This tweet from @NateSilver538 about a day ago, about the tone of @nytimes reporting was spot on. They asked: “can Biden still win?” That’s the wrong question !!! It made it seem like 2016 all over again. And that it was Trump’s to lose. Which was 💯 wrong and frankly dishonest:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s basically forging epistemic polarisation and chaos - America is too fragile (and weaponised) to handle this now. Our institutions have been tried enough ... here’s another remark to this effect from @NateSilver538 with this thread:  https://t.co/HEQp7turjF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think that @NateSilver538 has been upfront about this problem - how the media has forged an information divide between data-consumers, who know Biden has won versus the average American citizen who thinks it’s a “toss-up.” He writes on the @FiveThirtyEight blog:  https://t.co/GaqfcigjQm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is worse than generic both-sides-ism because it’s driven by ratings and profits, rather than a commitment to democracy ... and it ends up bordering on *disinformation* which is precisely what the media is there to correct.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here’s another, which makes the even bigger error, of foregrounding #Trump legal challenges. Which are mostly not even worthy of news. And distracts from the ACTUAL story, which is that #Biden is winning:  https://t.co/p45csPLDps<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The media has an incentive not to get it wrong. Thats a good thing. But now their just playing on American paranoia/ fragility for profit. THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS... it fuels conspiracy theory and sows doubt in the result. Exactly the opposite of what they should be doing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This makes it seem like it’s anyone’s race. And that encourages people to try and protest the results and assume their has been malfeasance. Here’s another:  https://t.co/hs9HjWfhQW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look. #Biden will win #Election2020 . That’s great news. But the way the media has handled this is despicable. I understand they are all reluctant to “call” the election yet - good to be conservative. But they should stop pretending it’s “razor thin”. Some recent headlines:  https://t.co/BKA4lnczZb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GosettiV Yeah. NO KIDDING ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterNRees I agree - another tragedy here. Although I think this cycle we might be able to poach a senator to pass something. So maybe I’m less pessimistic on this than most things<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndreiPoamaa @alexandreafonso Sauna Attendants for Jesus?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*sigh* ... If only it were so simple ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomTheuns @NWO_SSH @NWONieuws @PolSciLeiden @SimonOtjes @AndreiPoamaa @fragazzi @NYYordanova @Amy_Verdun Woot! Such good news... 🥳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the real tragedy of #Elections2020 . Even if Biden wins, we will ultimately lose the senate. And so, we can neither repudiate nor fix the horrors of Trumpism. Biden can tread water, but he cannot swim. And as a nation it is unlikely we can heal.   I am 💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenWintersgill @ashwinivasantha But I think I may also suffer from a fair amount of unwarranted rosy thinking ... this has happened before ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenWintersgill @ashwinivasantha Agreed - but this may say more about US pols ... as usual it’s easier to sell a story about progress v doom than about bureaucratic safeguards ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ashwinivasantha @OwenWintersgill Also, I don’t think this is a referendum on trump. I see it more as a test of institutions. It seems clear that in a truly fair election (w/out suppression etc), trump would lose by a mile. The question is if the institutions can hold... I actually see a lot of cause for hope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ashwinivasantha @OwenWintersgill I agree - I think this is the right reading of tonight. The US is in so many ways broken and deranged. But I think the counter-force of activism has been huge profound... a strong case against full-stop-ism<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Rousseau's critique of @realDonaldTrump ... the false security promised by despots:   “It will be said the despot assures his subjects of civil tranquility. Very well. But what do they gain [if] this tranquility is one of their miseries? A tranquil life is also had in dungeons."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the problem of kings and other autocrats (read: Hobbes) to whom you swear fealty for the sake of security:  “On this telling, the human race is divided into herds of cattle, each one having its own leader who guards it in order to devour it."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rousseau, via Montesquieu, on the relationship between leaders and institutions:  “At the birth of societies, says Montesquieu, it is the leaders of republics who bring about the institution, and thereafter it is the institution that forms the leaders of the republic.”<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@akd2003 Yeah, I’m sure that’s what they’re going for ... I’m just not sure I buy it ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@akd2003 And of course metaphorical empowerment is good. I'm not sure this is the way I would pursue it. But i see your point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@akd2003 yes - no question. but that kind of triumphant Hero imagery  (even if inverted) doesn't tend to diminish patriarchalism, but confirms its basis. (just replacing one idiom for another) ... consequently it ends up undercutting the deeper social change #MeToo is after.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@akd2003 You’re exactly right. (Good catch!) ... and that’s part of the issue. It’s suggesting that the antidote to male violence is female violence, which misplaces the point.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jacremes @alixabeth @reecejhawaii @klytlehernandez @stschrader1 So much of the problems of the American state are wrapped up in this convergence. So, good that you are pursuing it. Eager so see where you take it! 👊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jacremes @alixabeth @reecejhawaii @klytlehernandez @stschrader1 It is designed to deal w threats already present. This is part of the problem when people conflate ‘security’ and ‘militancy’. And it’s what makes the expansion of police profiles so heinous, especially in a mode like ICE, where these two logics converge. 3/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jacremes @alixabeth @reecejhawaii @klytlehernandez @stschrader1 The military is invested in sameness and inclusion in part because it is designed for expansion.

<|startoftext|>@jacremes @alixabeth @reecejhawaii @klytlehernandez @stschrader1 Late to chime in here.

<|startoftext|>@OwenWintersgill @enzoreds @adrian_kreutz @DrBillyXmas @UditThakur_ @dotdotdeet Bravo...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bonnie_honig @MarxinHell Indeed. I will try and do the same... 🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bonnie_honig @MarxinHell ha! yeah, maybe Kant wasn't the right beacon for guidance...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bonnie_honig @MarxinHell Terrific - thanks. Reminds me of that beautiful line from Baldwin where he says he cannot find himself in Rembrandt or Chartres Cathedral. ... I.e. that their putatively universal value and beauty had no place for him...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@enzoreds @jaredholley @MarxinHell @DrBillyXmas @UditThakur_ @dotdotdeet @OwenWintersgill A lot of this debate, like Twitter in general, comes down to an issue of tone. The position came off as anti-pluralist and gatekeeper-ish, rather than a plea for rigor ... this is an unfortunate aspect of the platform ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bonnie_honig @MarxinHell I don’t know this Hesse paper - sounds terrific. Thanks 🙏🏽.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irinibus @ykomska Yes. They have different capacities for narrative and argument. And they require wholly different voices.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@phillcole40 Yes. And a large part of the value of ‘decolonisation’ lies in uncovering *how* it resides in the present. This requires learning where to look...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ykomska @irinibus What a great thread! I love essays and try to write them. (I’m working on it!) ... But they are very hard, and in many ways a different muscle than academic writing... I also lo to teach essays (Baldwin, Benjamin, Solnit...). Don’t do enough of it. But working on that too ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The question is how we start to listen. One answer, although not the only one, is to incorporate new texts/voices/perspectives into our syllabi. Maybe this doesn't bear fruit right away, and things seem not to fit perfectly at first. But over time, the debate will be benefited 3/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But I think another important outcome of this thread is the debate about methodology. Rigor need not come at the expense of capaciousness. We should strive to be a listening discipline, that takes as many views into account. This will only make our arguments stronger over time 2/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JDJochim @DrBillyXmas Yes- and that capaciousness may itself be a value.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@billyisyoung @SSteinLubrano Yes, wow - where is that from?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@enzoreds @adrian_kreutz @rodrikdani Right. Which brings us back to why marginal is not the right word for APP in the US, although it may be better used for qual methods amongst empiricists. That was my point to begin with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@enzoreds @adrian_kreutz @rodrikdani Ok. But then everything in a plural discipline is marginal.... Either way, the broad us/uk distinction is a fair one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@enzoreds @adrian_kreutz @rodrikdani I never said high status departments. Either way, it’s not “marginal”. That’s the wrong word .... FWIW, even more critical programs take APP as the dominant idiom (for critique). It’s just that it is part of a roster of methods/approaches, and thus has no monopoly as in the uk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@enzoreds @adrian_kreutz @rodrikdani I don’t think that’s an accurate description of PT in the US. Analytic political phil is not marginal. In many ways/places it’s even dominant. It is just a more plural field... also, FWIW, US PT is more likely to contextualise APP into larger battles over intellectual lineage....<|endoftext|>

(Offset by a healthy dash of Arendt)... The article I read of hers was not too Schmittian, but i don't know the book. She writes on problems inherent to the invocation of emergencies (politically, rhetorically, legally)...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlakeProf @DanaSchmalz @JoshuaBraver1 @david_b_lebow @AdomGetachew @alybatt @erinrpineda @samuelmoyn @jacobinmag Hi - maybe not what you are looking for, but in contemporary political theory, check out Jennifer Rubenstein’s work on emergency.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@padrigmcg And any thinking person’s reaction to “progress” ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here’s what angers me about Bloomberg: He could have run as a republican and mounted a primary challenge to trump. Then he would be a hero. Instead he’s pretending to be a democrat and constantly reminding us how odious he is.... 🤬🤬🤬 ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@padrigmcg Looks like the history of the west, if the world ended in 1945<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>terrific article about ⁦@landemore⁩ and open democracy by ⁦@nathanheller⁩ ... 👏👏👏 ... and a great tool to get students interested in democratic theory ...  https://t.co/2DEb2XVx8k<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@johnwilliamsnyt What a terrifically interesting description... what was the book ?!?!??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenWintersgill Good for you that you read so much fiction. Political theory would be greatly improved if we all read more novels ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GosettiV 😍😍😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tmbejan Wow - that’s terrific! ... (I remember when you were working on this ... amazing how it all comes back around ...)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SnowTheory @ykomska Eeeeeeeeew!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Progress is not linear ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrSJFine Indeed ... Reminiscent of Honig’s plea in Democracy and the Foreigner to stop viewing foreigners as takers, but rather as givers ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Borges, remarking that the kind of leader who would build walls is the same type who burns books ... Seems timely ...  https://t.co/CWCHC9eB4I<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#netherlands, where wind is an opportunity ... 👏😍🌬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@enzoreds No I didn’t mean that. I meant whether the discipline actually recognised the impact the book had on it, as opposed to books that may forever change the arguments we make in PT/PP but have ourselves been slow to understand or accept.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@desireejweber 🔥🔥🔥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@desireejweber Ha!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@enzoreds Also, this table of contents offers a few stabs at your question (although most are before PL)  https://t.co/BSkPJEIuDX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@enzoreds I'm late to this debate, but its an odd way of asking the question. "Major impact" defined by whom? The discipline itself? Often the best critiques come from outside, but only recognized by the mainstream much later ... the question thus seems to beg the answer "none".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@enzoreds @davidthunderac1 carpe diem... Relatedly, I just taught rawls as the centerpiece of a foundational lecture in my "contemporary political philosophy" course. I wonder how long it will be before that falls out of fashion...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cszabla Hi - no I didn’t know that. Thanks for @‘ing me! ... Although as part of my book research I did hear a lot about border patrol facilities, training units, etc across Central America and the Caribbean, esp in Panama. So maybe not so surprising that it’s a global enterprise...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@syllabus_tweets Thanks for the RT!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@prof_mirya What a terrifically kind thing to do. And such a great milestone. I hope you make it to 1000...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomTheuns @AndreiPoamaa I have so much to learn...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndreiPoamaa @TomTheuns Pronounce it? I don’t even know what city that’s in...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ltthompso Indeed. But at least he’d find a way to complain about the traffic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndreiPoamaa @TomTheuns Wait. What building is that? I want to teach there too!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aesager For classic texts, try Plato’s The Statesman. A nice dialogue on the purchase of the outsider, which has also worked well for me in the past. ... also, in a very different vein, Montesquieu’s Persian Letters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aesager I like intersperse migrant stories between sense theory/philosophy texts. I find the edited volume, The Good Immigrant is an excellent start. Very readable, sometimes funny, often moving stories that nonetheless bring up a lot of the big issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@George_Maximus @reecejhawaii @HenkvanHoutum Wow - thanks for calling this to my attention<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@alixabeth ‘Big in Korea’ is the new ‘Big in Japan’ ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@enzoreds Agreed - it’s terrible. Not just cruel but shortsighted. It penalises ambition ... Think how many hours are wasted on (much longer) drafts that no one will see! ... it also shifts power to gatekeepers, rewarding replication and constricting vision. Sets the whole continent back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danaujoks @AmitavAcharya @isanet @reecejhawaii @NancyAHiemstra @mershoncenter Oof. Even the question fills me with horror...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danaujoks @AmitavAcharya @isanet @reecejhawaii @NancyAHiemstra @mershoncenter Ha! Conversely, if Twitter becomes “real life”, maybe the universe will explode...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@padrigmcg Odd detailing on the lampshade. A foot, kicking a cat. Perhaps a further reflection on family life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmitavAcharya @danaujoks @isanet @reecejhawaii @NancyAHiemstra Agreed. But he was part of that generation of scholars that overstated globalisation and poorly identified the tools nation-states would use/cultivate in response. Hardly a failing - and in many ways an impossible challenge - but it makes it now seem quite dated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rosacolmenarejo @PeterVerovsek Hi - that’s great to hear. Please DM me and I will send you more specific info.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aesager @serena_parekh I agree completely - and it seems especially true in this field. There is still so much we don't understand about the practical politics of immigration enforcement that empirical uncovering remains an essential predicate to analytical parsing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aesager @serena_parekh Thanks! Glad to be included on this impressive list ... And good of you to foreground so many books that foreground a mixed theory/empirics approach (which don’t always fit neatly into the pol phil canon). Much appreciated!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jennifernvictor Nice juxtaposition. Can we officially refer to political scientists as “second responders” ... ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@enzoreds @RebeccaKukla @lastpositivist Oh if that’s where you’re going, then read Sassen. Not just Global City but also Territory, Authority, Rights ... also James Tully talks about cities in this way in his new book on glocalism/citizenship<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@enzoreds Great topic. Do you know Doug Rae’s “The City”.

<|startoftext|>@PeterVerovsek @enzoreds This is the point in the conversation where I half expect enzo to grow bored of the sociological exploration and ask a more abstract question like ‘what is time?’ just to see if anyone is still paying attention ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@enzoreds What a terrifically unexpected-but-interesting-question. It has to be status, no? Better to wear a piece you could show, the new vogue, than one you concealed? ... I have a suspicion that Bourdieu would have something to say about this ...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bbehlendorf @wilsonquarterly Now the key is to at least enumerate them. Once we have that, we can begin to develop regulatory structures of enforcement .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbehlendorf @wilsonquarterly But the state still needs way more regulation. Maybe you can’t put the cat back in the bag, but you can cut it’s nails. (Or something). And the same pertains to rights. If we could go back, we would clearly bake some stronger civil liberties protections into the cake.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tlesam I agree with all these points - and clearly represents a knowledge of the map that most liberal reader won’t have .... but if anything this is evidence to also eliminate the electoral college ... we should still eliminate/reform the senate !!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First as Farce; then as Parody<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LayWilliams that’s some version of progress...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@enzoreds The beard is a nice accessory ... really ties the outfit together ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another amazing bit, now about ‘flaming’, a word we def need to bring back ...  https://t.co/3E9jYMNa6K<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reading up on early critical accounts of data surveillance ... here is a gem from Roger Clarke in 1994, discussing early use of “smiley symbols”  https://t.co/UaXQq9j8XG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>... “‘why don’t we fill the river with poison, so the wetbacks instantly die,’ he later suggested offhand in a fatherly discussion with his children” ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GosettiV @APSAtweets Yeah, waaaaaaaaaaay too early for that ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Serious empirical evidence in favour of dropping 8am panels ... what say you @APSAtweets? ... pretty please 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alixabeth 🤓🤓🤓 ... likewise...  Twitter has that feeling of a giant college dorm, where at any given time you knew *someone* would be awake ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alixabeth Without doubt the best thing about Twitter ... it’s out-of-the-blue-ness ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just as Buddha intended ...  https://t.co/NrFu38prsC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And “Freud” ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does this count for teachers too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HAHAHAHAHAHA ... *sigh* ...  https://t.co/14L8oxW7Ni<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How terrifically inspiring ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ahem, I think Trump would like to have a word with you ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imagine #Faulkner today: “read, read, read. Read everything - Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, Snapchat, and see how they do it” ... 😬😬😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JNemsingh 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oof. So glad to be in a profession without any of these ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lenings!!!! ... Every once in a while we have to pause the despair and remember that the world is *also* amazing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here is the full, unabridged list of people Trump has ever said sorry to<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Trump is the Master of Spectacle, we can now officially say his border wall is a *Spectacular* Failure ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BufacchiV That looks terrific- thanks for letting me know!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2019 ... Existential iPhone geographies ... does Tlaxacala even exist? @sasha_trub<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If it doesn’t sell, they should cut a hole in the back and market it as a porta-potty ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surveillance humour in the men’s room ... 2019, everybody ...  https://t.co/x5wCw8l6ie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brilliant article by ⁦@katforrester⁩ in the ⁦@BostonReview⁩ ... a needed intervention on the state of political philosophy, long overdue ...  https://t.co/89mtVcizCD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Baldwin... I love him... even just watching him listen ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@francisco_hcxse @bicycleuser @SusanneFerwerda I second this - really an interesting book ... draws on a lot of theory, especially Jungian psychoanalysis...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusanneFerwerda @bicycleuser Wow - thanks Jennifer, that’s very kind of you ... And Susanne, your work sounds very interesting. Please let me know how it comes along ... always eager to hear about other border theories/conceptualisations ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterVerovsek @enzoreds @BattagliCharles ... or alcohol ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@enzoreds @BattagliCharles @PeterVerovsek Iconic indeed ... Next to Peter, outside the frame, was also Bernardo Zacka, looking equally doubtful/bemused ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@memomiller @andreanne_ob @SLNazario @PJDunleavy Thanks - yes, and I need to read yours. Hopefully someday we’ll find occasion to talk about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andreanne_ob @memomiller @SLNazario @PJDunleavy Thanks Andreanne! Very honoured to be part of your list!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@huzzahmpls We judge him for youthiness bc, y’know, #millennial ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@walkingtogitmo Or just, you know, an occasion for self reflection ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lea_ypi Ha! Yeah, all jumbled up ... quick answer: none of it is empirical ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aesager Wow - looks terrific. Congrats!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@huzzahmpls That was terrific ... hadn’t seen that before !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look at that soul-dead grin ... He doesn’t even care about the money. He just cares that you care about the money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@huzzahmpls Yeah. And all the cameras and make-up... hard to see it as anything else...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RebekahKTromble @julia_azari Lying? ... (I know, too easy) ... failing to appear ‘normal’ when eating corn dogs?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@julia_azari I don’t know. I could see Biden in a one-piece... and anyway, maybe if we call it a pageant, trump will fund it ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting read by @julia_azari on the problems of the debate process ... side note: among us, can we please just start calling them pageants?  https://t.co/mVJ2hwdvej<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VSapiro Yeah, and open sewers ... must have been a great age for rats ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>how foreign, and beautiful ... the city without cars ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiseRButler Brilliant...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Same. Except the White House, 2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@memomiller Wow a still, terrifying... I’ve had definitely had some strange encounters at tradings, but that really takes the cake ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@memomiller Congratulations! ... glad to hear the knife stayed sheathed ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@M_A_Ferdoush @HuuDijstelbloem @UvA_Amsterdam Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Victor_Asal @stsumej @JuliaHellwege @mallendo Me too! I hope you do a post on it...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_FRONTERAS_ @womenalsoknow That looks terrific ... wish I could be a fly on the wall ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HuuDijstelbloem @UvA_Amsterdam Yes - really looking forward!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterVerovsek Autocorrect<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterVerovsek It’s a tough neighbourhood<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ykomska Yes, sad to see this kind of language go ...really puts a time stamp on the letter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Samantharhill Wow- terrific. So steamy, almost uncomfortable to read ... do you have more?!!?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@desireejweber Ha! ... yes, we should definitely walk out together ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@desireejweber At least one who could read Pig(eon) Latin ... I’ll show myself out ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@desireejweber Or a pigeon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenWintersgill @PeterVerovsek Agreed on both counts. One of the things I valued most from my time at oxford was the pleasure/challenge of responding to him in workshops.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DLind #PMQs definitely needed in US politics ... reminds me of that old Robin Williams joke that “parliament is like congress with a two drink minimum” ... so perfect ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New country slogan....  The Netherlands: Most likely to stay in the EU, even after everyone else leaves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenWintersgill @PeterVerovsek Indeed ... Almost like a narrative device ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenWintersgill @PeterVerovsek Terrific. My favourite kind of argument...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenWintersgill 😎😎😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenWintersgill so i figured... excuse my lame attempt at Twitter Humor ... Eager to read it when it comes out ... (BTW: what press? the  pic didnt show...)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Tragedy of the Moderns: From Louche to Douche<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenWintersgill Also, will you be doing any book events on the continent? If so, let me know. Maybe we can lure you to Holland ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenWintersgill What do we owe refugees? You mean, other than the chance to compete for jobs we don’t want (but will resent them for taking), poor healthcare (we will nonetheless blame on them) and generations of collective antipathy? ... Interesting question. Probably worth a read ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mephenke @thehertieschool @TobiasBunde @ARGohdes @NinaSilove @aa_gilli @Mauro_Gilli @EISSnetwork @CISP_Hertie Congratulations! I’m really happy that everything has worked out for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProfDilts Ha! very tempting.. its far, but man, i do love LA ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProfDilts @APSAtweets @CUP_PoliSci Thanks! ... very much appreciated ... One of these days/conferences I hope to get the chance to meet in person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProfCZM @APSAtweets @CUP_PoliSci Thanks for saying so 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jtlevy And it gave a forum for people to speak across their competence (on which they wouldn't necessarily write papers) ... All very promising trends, and I hope @APSAtweets keeps it up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jtlevy I would also add that the greater variety of panels this year (especially the increase in roundtables) is propitious for this theory/empirics dialogue ... This allowed for debates on subjects that were present-forward/cutting-edge (and thus not necessarily pre-written-papers) ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jtlevy I think part of this is that empirical and normative concerns (esp. vis-a-vis democracy and rule of law) are closer than ever before. But there also seems to be an increased understanding in the discipline that this dialogue is necessary ... I hope this carries into #APSA2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jtlevy I agree with this - the empirical panels on populism/democracy were terrific this year. The first time I have been to APSA and felt the "theme" generated debate (not just lip service).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SheenaGreitens @APSAtweets @CUP_PoliSci thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdomGetachew @APSAtweets @CUP_PoliSci Likewise! We'll have to do better in #APSA2020 ... Also, I was sorry to miss the panel on your book. (... I guess I'll just have to read it ... 😉😉😉 )<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@APSAtweets @CUP_PoliSci And a warm thanks to Lisa Wedeen, Jennifer Rubenstein, @DrAdrianBlau, @tunablazer, Signy Gutnick-Allen and Bernardo Zacka for our terrific panel on "Ethnography and Political Theory" ... (my apologies for the terrible pic, its all I have!)  https://t.co/1cbj92Xloa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just home from #APSA2019 @APSAtweets  ... Wanted to extend a huge thanks to everyone for making it such a good experience and especially to the IMM Group for the Charles Taylor Book Award (pic w Bernardo Zacka) and @CUP_PoliSci for their generous Awards Dinner and book display 1/  https://t.co/L4VbnkLCGs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterNRees @OwenWintersgill @aesager @reecejhawaii Great Q ... I would check out the work by Jeremy Slack @machoogabacho (And his new book w Whitfield and Martinez, In the Shadow of the Wall, about the failure of deportation, broadly).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenWintersgill @chrisbrooke @TstrongTracy In situ  https://t.co/78yskOFTT6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenWintersgill @chrisbrooke Even if it hasn’t ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenWintersgill @chrisbrooke @TstrongTracy Yes - absolutely terrific ... The gravitas ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenWintersgill @chrisbrooke I think most academic prose sounds better in your accent. I hereby invite you anytime to read on my behalf...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenWintersgill @chrisbrooke Great discussion. But the accent was surprisingly American ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alixabeth It’s all self-interested ... just trying to lure you back 😎😎😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great article by ⁦@dawn_teele⁩! ... And by extension, women who DO publish tons should be considered superheroes 🦸‍♀️🦸‍♀️🦸‍♀️ ... ⁦@APSAtweets⁩ ⁦@womenalsoknow⁩ ...   https://t.co/NnNjdmnfFV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, rubber bands are basically tagliatelle - am I right? #poliscicooks ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrDuncanBell @AntonJaegermm @cambridge_cpt This looks terrific - I saw bits of an early draft from Bernardo.... very nice to see it in print.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Definitely time for some “Distracted First Lady” memes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@memomiller Hero<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattGrossmann Thanks for the plug! Much appreciated ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Update: more Baudrillard in #Amsterdam ...  https://t.co/lglKUGYgIt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welcome to the Simulacrum! ... (pace Baudrillard) ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ykomska “Raspberry Cave” sounds like a great venue for psychedelics...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoWolffBSG @patchurchland Terrific quotation. Thanks for sharing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The irony is unbearable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenWintersgill Very sorry to hear this - get well soon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AFixedPoint_ Does he, though? Or does he view “Hindus and Muslims” as ethnic markers, just like everything else?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JNemsingh You know what he’s thinking: JUST BUILD A WALL AND MAKE PAKISTAN PAY FOR IT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Its consistently impressive how little Trump understands how borders work ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A million times yes ... reflects the broader point, that people who don’t respect migrants usually don’t understand labor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Make NYC Great Again ...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@michelledean What a terrifically beautiful quote. Thank you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MFBosworth @AndreiPoamaa I know the feeling ... eager to hear about the new project when it takes shape ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndreiPoamaa @MFBosworth Hi @MFBosworth - you’re article sounds fascinating ... They are publishing a lot of articles of this sort at Geopolitics these days. If it’s more theoretical, try CRISPP; if it’s more emprical try either Journal of Borderlands Studies or Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@yoeskenawas Terrific to hear. Break a leg,,,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@suboticjelena @dacretu Ha! Cool ... if that floats your boat, check out Alt-J ... math geekery &amp; moving music to the extreme<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@suboticjelena @dacretu so well said. They are the only band these days that really moves me. The music feels so honest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DLind @JonathanBlitzer @MichelleBrane Yes, but with a lot of US oversight, and our fingers in the process at all times ... it’s the ultimate colonial relationship: do as we say, but do it yourself. (And get punished if you step out of line).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@desireejweber @alixabeth Yes me too - but timing terrible here too, am away and have little internet. But happy to start an email chain in a few weeks ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottDafydd Hi - thanks for spreading the word. Very much appreciated...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@desireejweber @alixabeth Yes - with pleasure. It’s the thing I would have wanted most as a grad student - a real engagement with the subject of political theory and method. Very glad to see it’s beginning to catch on ... Happy to share the texts I teach/swear by.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alixabeth Terrific - thanks. Sounds like a great course, btw... I aspire to teach something similar ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alixabeth Thanks - very nice of you to say ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeffguhin @ltthompso @APSAtweets That would be great - let’s touch base in late August.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dmk1793 @LiseRButler @chrisbrooke @APSAtweets Ha! Terrific. More or less my life goals too. I have for a long time been impressed by the side-writing/diaries of old-school anthropologists for this very reason ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiseRButler @APSAtweets Thanks!  Yes, the argument resurfaces every now and again... Also, a lot of resonance with claims made by contemporaneous anthro theory/philosophy of social science thinkers like Peter Winch ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeffguhin @ltthompso @APSAtweets Terrific - if you happen to be at APSA, would be happy to talk about it ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ltthompso Thanks, Luke... it profited greatly from our late nite journeys up the Narragansett...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GPodmalm Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danaujoks @APSAtweets 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nicoblar @APSAtweets Thanks! Very glad to get the argument out there ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you will be at APSA @apsatweets in Washington DC, we will present this argument on a panel on #ethnography and #politicaltheory ... Thursday, August 29th, at 4pm in the Onni Shoreham ... If you are interested in debates on methodology &amp; political theory, please stop by!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey Twitter - big news!   Have a short article in the APSR @APSAtweets with Bernardo Zacka. We make a case for using ethnographic methods to contribute to debates in political theory.  Check it out - it’s open access ... Please RT!   https://t.co/eKhVOhO7P7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrAdrianBlau Trump makes me embarrassed to be sentient.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bravo 👏 Go @KrishVignarajah !!! (And hi! Hope you are well...)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@newman_chris @realMABarreto Very well said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenWintersgill Hmmm. Nice entreaty ... seems you’re suggesting Twitter *shouldn’t* just be a vacuous pit of complaint ... I’ll have to think about that ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RebekahDowd19 Yeah, a lot unexplained.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrAdrianBlau Agreed....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@transb0rder That’s a great scheme to incentivise productivity ... I do that w cooking ... (#poliscicooks !)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrAdrianBlau Certainly- I’m sure any such classification scheme is hugely problematic... still, not the optics I was craving ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@transb0rder Wow - You’re really good! You seriously offering ?!?!?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I find this so demoralizing... I consider myself to be an open-minded (woke!) male, who would not find himself snookered into an old-boys-clubby discipline and then I look up #criticaltheory and #politicaltheory and ... *sigh* ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emayfarris @profmusgrave Progress is not linear...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alixabeth Yes - and this really distills is so upsetting about MAGAism. It is the pursuit of a native space free of other races (even mutually native ones), thereby collapsing the two logics and facilitating rhetorical slippage, despite the huge harm inherent in doing so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This looks beautiful 👇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Give us your tired, your poor ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danaujoks Brilliant ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump: he for whom Twitter alone is insufficiently narcissistic ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sbmitche @alixabeth so interesting. what was the political point behind it? was it trying to target certain peoples/views vis-a-vis Iraq? or was it more kitchy/random?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sbmitche @alixabeth ha! interesting... definitely makes it weirder... i think i feel more comfortable sticking to baseball...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alixabeth See, this is why we need #polisci baseball cards ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarringtonWard @smsaideman Interesting take. And many good reasons to be cynical re Israeli Politics. But still don’t see how this isn’t a dubious longterm strategy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heathbrown Too soon, too soon ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KalypsoNicolaid Gotta love a good Brueghel mock-up ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarringtonWard @smsaideman What does that have to do w the decision to buddy up w anti-semites? Still seems dubious strategically...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smsaideman Wow - if that’s true, it’s unbelievably short-sighted... do you ever ask how they think this will play out long-term?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RaulACarrillo @memomiller yeah. or, you know, just colonize them...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>... And both are principally symbolic, demarcating a boundary that is not itself contested, and in so doing reifying a kind of bordering that no longer obtains ...  Pure genius.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>... and a perfect distillation of our varied normative commitments: the former, intended as an obstacle (signifying distrust of Mexicans and other Latin Americans); the latter would actually make crossing easier (signifying lack of concern about Canadians) ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Preposterous, agreed ... But a terrific metaphor. The "Slash" on the northern border is the precise inverse of the "Wall" on the southwest border ... the former, a vertical structure that rises up from flat earth; the latter, a vertical recess that dips down from raised forest ..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_James_Riding @EssBarraclough @JackWakeWalker What a terrifically interesting collaboration ... bravo!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SheenaGreitens @profTLe @DubstepInDPRK @ConradCourtenay @EmilyHRitter @hamlinr1 That’s really interesting,esp with the new pseudo-populist-cum-authoritarian regimes popping up (Bolsonaro, Erdogan, Orban) everywhere, causing new kinds of flight, esp intellectuals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SheenaGreitens @ConradCourtenay @EmilyHRitter @hamlinr1 Thanks - that’s very kind of you! ... (also, your project sounds v cool. Am eager to hear how it turns out ...

<|startoftext|>This is so tragic ... @ewarren is such a better candidate. So smart and so deserving ... passing on her, just to vote “strategically” would be such a mistake...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jtlevy Yes. It comes out whenever the wrongdoing is especially blatant... Its as though he’s surprised that we’re still surprised ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PamelaPaulNYT Oddly, that actress looks like Merkel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tdunmoye @Biometricstate You never know!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>... I think dems will only lose in 2020 if they keep to the Wall/ICE script... On this topic, they are better served with policy, not politics ... surveys like this one take us further from thinking about real immigration reform, and back into the stupid debate about the wall ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>... I’m also not sure what the positions in the WP article really tells us about the candidates. I would rather see a discussion about some of the less sexy/toxic topics, such as decriminalising certain aspects of the border crossing/ deportation process ... 3/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>... with no positive content or vision. What about a position that talks about how immigrants are actually really valuable for a country, and tries to empower them or harness economic &amp; social potential... 2/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A fine overview, but too much focus on salacious topics - the wall, ICE, family separation, etc ... but nothing 1/  https://t.co/JWyE0Rzf16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Borderlands are everywhere - right @Biometricstate ???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who you callin’ a rabbit? I’m a hare...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_edinh @ykomska @CasMudde I think what is most interesting about nation in the borderlands is that even one’s ‘own’ nationals in the borderlands often identify least with the center - so they are part of the heterogeneity too. I think some very microscopic studies get at this dynamic. But it’s hard...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_edinh @ykomska @CasMudde ... in the center of the country, insider/outsider is (relatively) clear. But not on the border, which is why identity in the borderlands is such a challenging space to navigate. And it breeds so many interesting loyalties/heterogeneities ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_edinh @ykomska @CasMudde Yes - part of the challenge of writing about nation in any borderlands is that you have to ask ‘which’ nation people belong to, how do you describe mixes. In the US case this is hard as, for ex, how do you codify Mexican-Americans? ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reecejhawaii @_edinh Thanks!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ykomska @_edinh @CasMudde For a good classic treatment of borders &amp; nationalism, the best is Sahlins’ Boundaries: The Making of France &amp; Spain in the Pyrenees ... but in general this field is less well developed than one would think. A good opportunity for research if that is what you are thinking ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ykomska @_edinh Thanks @ykomska for the plug! ... in general there is very little out there on borders/ nationalism in the US. We tend to think of American nationalism vis-a-vis the unwanted migrant (c.f. Populism, as w the work of @CasMudde) but skip over the border itself ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tanvim @FergusPeace @nikeshshukla @RefugeeTales 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tanvim @FergusPeace if you are looking more for theory, a masterpiece is Julia Kristeva's Strangers unto Ourselves ... A very interesting current treatment is @xThomas_Nail's Figure of the Migrant. (I would also add my own book to this list, although it focuses more on borders than crossers) ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FergusPeace @Tanvim For ethics, my favorite book on the subject is Bonnie Honig's Democracy and the Foreigner. Beautifully written - a rare feet in the political philosophy biz.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FergusPeace @Tanvim Also, the book of short stories, The Good Immigrant, edited by @nikeshshukla and Refugee Tales, edited by David Herd and Anna Pincus (@RefugeeTales)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarringtonWard @alixabeth @npratc I agree - that’s infuriating, but unfortunately it seems like a trap that even conscientious members of the media are unable to avoid ... how to be impartial when one side is not arguing in good faith ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@david_darmofal @abyss_gazer @alixabeth yes - please do ... And thanks for the reflections on @KamalaHarris. She has many of the qualities I most value in a candidate, and emotional intelligence is one of them ... It's an essential mark of a good politician: being able to speak and listen at the same time...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarringtonWard @alixabeth Literally, the twilight zone...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just to say that I’m glad people like @neal_katyal are out there  https://t.co/kvtvOpyxNG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@padrigmcg The Los Angeles river, a dialogue  https://t.co/PGUUamvwRU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alixabeth Yeah, I wouldn't say I prefer her either because of substantive disagreement, but I would sure love to see her up there ... She basically embodies my Fantasy of Loathing &amp; Revenge ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alixabeth Ha! nice mixed metaphor ... Also, perhaps not the most sophisticated point, but I increasingly distinguish Dem 2020 candidates based on whether I think they can stand up to Trump on a debate stage and not wither ... On that measure she tops the list. I'd bet 💰💰💰on her any day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alixabeth Yes. And on a perhaps more aesthetic level, I could listen to her all day. The clarity of thought and speech, the unwillingness to cede time or control of the discussion. Absolute 🔥🔥🔥...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It’s impossible to overstate how important this is ... A democracy where citizens cannot protest - to put voice to grievance - is not democratic ... Especially in the borderlands, where civil liberties are routinely trampled by the vague and merciless hand of the law.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alixabeth @NateSilver538 @julia_azari Also - you’d also want a category for *actual* politicians who thought/wrote critically about politics... think, Václav Havel  ... or political artists/novelists (so many here. Ai Weiwei comes to mind ...)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DiCintio @thenation @CUP_PoliSci @atossaaraxia Also, re: Israel/Palestine. Definitely - this was actually the first place I ever went to study boundaries - Wall/checkpoints, etc -  where I first drew most of my insights ... not much Il/Pa stuff ended up in the book. But hopefully in the future...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiCintio @thenation @CUP_PoliSci @atossaaraxia Thanks! In fact, i think there’s a lot of applicability to conflict zones. And areas w boundary disputes... I see a lot of progressive potential, if we design the right sorts of institutions, around the idea.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KWegschaider Ha - yes! I think that, as with the breach of the wall in real life, the #GoT Wall should be a decoy. The horrors outside should be easily solvable. The real struggle should be internal ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And, if somebody does putatively win the #GoT throne, the shadow of their death is already looming ... That's the way all epic stories like this should end: not with answers, but further questions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why you want is for something to leave the reader in doubt ... The best way that happens is if #DanaerysTargaryen LOSES CONTROL OF HER DRAGONS ... So no matter who wins, in a way, nobody wins. And the lesson is brutal: in politics there may be love and blood. but never certainty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now for my unsolicited geeky Game of Thrones opinion. There are many ways GoT can end - but only one good one ... with UNCERTAINTY ... No one should win the throne. That would be too easy. But nor should they all kill each other 1/<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hispeedtourist 🙏🏽🥂🙏🏽🥂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hispeedtourist Thanks for the RT ... yeah, the stats on border spending are mind boggling... (esp. re: value on return) ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So yes, @MSNBC is part of the cable swamp. Bravo to @jakebackpack for the careful profile. But focusing on their specific failures vis-a-vis American politics only scratches the surface. We also have to reconsider our place in the broader world of news too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But its also an artifact of being in a corner of Academia that positions the US in these broader geopolitical developments. As with writing on borders (@reecejhawaii, @Geopolitics2020), migration (@UnlawfulEntries), populism (@CasMudde), etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe this jadedness comes from the fact that I live in Europe - I teach @PolSciLeiden and interact primarily with international students. This makes MSNBC's brand of "left Americana" seem particularly empty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not to mention all the "Green New Deals" across Europe and worldwide. Do these not matter? (Of course they do). But MSNBC ignores them because it doesn't fit into their narrative about Trump and the Rep/Dem turf war.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, for all the attention to Trump's wall, its remarkable how infrequently the channel discusses all the other walls popping up around the world. Are these phenomena related? Were these other attempts at border security effective? What kind of domestic politics produced them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For example: for all the focus on Trump, there is a tremendous lack of attention on MSNBC to other forms of populism/xenophobia in other parts of the world - Brexit, Brazil, Hungary. Are we not a part of this phenomenon? Can we learn nothing by discussing them in tandem?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So its good that this profile is out there - I think we need to start broadening our horizons about what counts as newsworthy in the US, and holding stations like MSBNC to account. (Voting with our feet if we have to).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But the main problem with MSNBC is it further provincializes the left. Americans, even educated ones, are rarely well informed about the rest of the world, and MSNBC's obsession with the petty intrigue of washington politics soaks all attention away from global subjects 3/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The criticisms are real. I think the 24/7 obsession with Mueller is not productive - it risks turning a legitimate inquiry into the witch hunt that detractors purport it to be (but which it never was in the first place). Hysteria is rarely an attractive repose. 2/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is an interesting portrait of MSNBC. I am a fan of the Rachel Maddow show, and broadly support the agenda of the station. Cable TV is a flawed field, and MSNBC is a flawed station 1/  MSNBC’s Wild Ride   https://t.co/zwsYVmRbzC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OwenWintersgill They say the band is outstanding ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MigrationNerd @thaniasanc @ProfTortuga Great thread - on this point, you should check out The Shadow of the Wall, which covers similar ground, based on *excellent* fieldwork. Its here:   https://t.co/D4oFrcjld7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenWintersgill @crookedfootball Hi David - welcome to the abyss...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DLind Yeah - I think we all feel this way. There are SO many immigration crises/urgencies in the present it's hard to be future-looking at all ... What would it even mean to have an 'anticipatory' climate refugee policy? Any honest model would either be too noisy or resemble doomsday.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>People still shocked by Trumpiana and Border Wall Mania apparently haven’t spent enough time in Arkansas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As academics it feels like we are inbox managers first; researchers/teachers second ... these days, ‘writing time’ means ‘ignore inbox’ time, which only leaves you further behind. A vicious cycle ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Important intervention. Email volume is out of control. We need new norms about email sending/replying.    https://t.co/reiNh70lVb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alixabeth Yeah. And of course ‘intent unto meanness’ is impossible to establish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alixabeth Which is to say it has no punitive function. It’s just horribly cruel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DLind Fantastic. All hail the three most magical words in English: 'pitchers and catchers' ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sean_c_lee Thanks! Ah yes, detention ... a space I know well ... Let me know what you think...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really does throw into relief the absurdity of borders...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pebonilla Or Brett Kavanaugh's drinking buddies...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Given tomorrow's conference on Mouffe's Left Populism @ColumbiaCCCT #Praxis1313 seems like a good time to re-post this:  Book Review: For a Left Populism by Chantal Mouffe  https://t.co/UCqAXblyGT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seyla Benhabib on the threats intrinsic to left populism. A very wise piece - I wish I could be there!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PollyWilkins @TomTheuns @vnbateman Interesting. Yes, a perverse side effect of Brexit ... but also social media in general... I lived for three years in the UK but w/out tv and wasn’t on sm. Basically a bubble. Only learning this stuff now that I’m on Twitter!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomTheuns @PollyWilkins @vnbateman Yes. Idiots in multiple senses. Idiots for mindlessly perpetuating ‘normal’ social values. (esp about body norms). And idiots for mocking something they don’t seem to understand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PollyWilkins @vnbateman yes - poorly worded tweet. I didn't mean to say I thought this was BBC. Just that I used to think very highly of British TV and was surprised to see this kind of laughy-sneery tone I identify with American junk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When did #British TV get this stupid? ... I used to revere the BBC, or at least what we got of it in the states. But this is Fox-n-Friends level dumb ... I quite respect what @vnbateman is doing. No need to mock her...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@heathbrown @gorenlj @CUP_PoliSci @NewBooksPoliSci Hi - thanks for the plug. Glad to hear of your interest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Politics, distilled<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Master &amp; Margarita II: Capitalism Edition<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnwilliamsnyt Indeed. My own attitude toward physical pain/exertion is better embodied by one of Woody Allen’s alter-egos, who, upon being asked whether he goes to the gym, remarked ‘I prefer to atrophy’.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. The Logic of Borders too ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jacremes Nicely put ... a reminder that fencing (and signage) is always two sided, with different meanings carrying significance to different people at different times...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, a long legacy of vigilantism, leading all the way up to the minutemen ... the US borderlands have a special way of attracting this variant of ‘white man’s burden’<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoWolffBSG You might call that a ‘raw deal’...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the most perverse features of Border Security Mania is the belief that ordinary (white) citizens should act as vigilantes, to ‘help law enforcement’. We shouldn’t it. This is not what it means to live in a free society.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@desireejweber Yes - and remarkable the ease with which it elides capitalism and heteronormativity ... utterly unthinking, as if by rote...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alixabeth And this is precisely what thinking about time as a political value lets you unpack .. (I think!) .. But perhaps this reflects a personal disposition. I tend to be wary of attempts to reduce politics to procedure, when in fact the two are intimately (and interestingly!) entangled<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alixabeth I see what you mean. But presenting it that way masks the fact that there are very different tactics at play. reducing the one to the other eliminates specificity. Otherwise put: we choose to stall in different ways, based on what options present themselves (and at what cost). 1/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alixabeth Yes - and an interesting example of where formal and informal time politics align. (On the one hand, the use of institutional procedures; on the other hand, backroom stalling tactics).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Capitalism's response to suffering.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@danlatorre @atossaaraxia yes - 'smart city' and 'smart borders' technologies employ similar tactics with a terrifying degree of overlap between the two...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very insightful piece by @atossaaraxia ... must read on #borders  https://t.co/LaKrb4fU06<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jacremes @bomalley500 Thanks! ... Yes, our borderzones of questionable democratic/citizenship practices is a huge area of concern, something I feel we are all only beginning to unpack ... FWIW I make this point in greater detail in a different @BostonReview piece, from April:  https://t.co/JdkVV7ug6J<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Is this a metaphor for Congress?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, but our capacity for distraction is mind-bending ... Until we figure out how to retain focus in the Twitter Age, we are doomed to repeat this cycle until there is nothing else ... but Twitter ... a dark thought.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They don't call 'em Freedom Fries for nothing, folks...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samuelmoyn this is the same logic the state employs when it uses algorithms to generate risk ratings - taking unstructured life stories and translating them into structured data profiles.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DLind FWIW I treat some of these issues here (albeit briefly):  https://t.co/JdkVV7ug6J<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DLind That's me! Yes, I talk about walls as symbols, and specifically that we are missing something important if we only see them as embodying fantasies of exclusion, when they also embody fantasies of expansion and cooptation ... perhaps this is what you had in mind? let me know!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidwaldnerdc yes. or, instrumentally religious...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@84Mand @ProfTags @RutiRegan Ps. Thx for the plug, Amanda Pps. For another authority on this check out @reecejhawaii<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@84Mand @ProfTags @RutiRegan Yes- I talk about this in my book The Politics of Borders. In fact border communities are often the most likely to understand why ‘walls don’t work’, and distrust political rhetoric thrusted upon them from the center.    https://t.co/mmznHsh0eR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Toal_CritGeo @MMalksoo Yeah, I think it’s certainly true that the proximity to powerful women prompts him to spew more hatred than normal. But the actual comments are totally in line with his regular levels of geopolitical ignorance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The road to Brexit is long and tortuous...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Toal_CritGeo Interesting take. Although it’s probably just idiocy... sometimes we consider these things too deeply. The man doesn’t read ...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GroverXV @scsazak Yes. She’s definitely a propagandist. But there’s something time-specific, too. It’s no longer spin, or the classic political move of massaging the truth.

<|startoftext|>@Serdjosega FWIW: In general, I think it’s great that the WC is hosted abroad. I think most of the ugly, violent norms of football emanate from W. Europe &amp; Britain ... de-cantering the sport is the key to perpetuating it as a global form of cultural diplomacy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Serdjosega That doesn’t follow. This particular arrangement has eve-more complicated parameters. So we should be wary that ‘things might go wrong’ ...”<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@abbey_st Yeah. Also, when has this ever worked? ... More weapons in the hands of criminals *may* help stall (unarmed) migrants. Unlikely, but fine.

<|startoftext|>This is the same perverse logic that produced strategies like ‘fund the Muhajideen to defeat the Soviets’ or ‘aid Saddam against Iran’... shortsighted, and easy to mock, but far more pervasive than we would like to believe.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is ... not a good take ... not just because it is substantively asinine, but because it undercuts the entire basis of democratic representation and popular sovereignty... it’s literally the opposite of those things, and would render Congress not only broken but meaningless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MRogers097 Yes. Also, the government has been quietly undercutting the normative basis of citizenship for years. Now he’s just dog- whistling to his base.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>my kinda POV ... thanks @Geopolitics2020! #borderwalls2018 #murs2018<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maya_sen yes - its amazing how hard it is for these politicians to accord that simple basis of respect ... the inability to acknowledge someone else's pain. makes me ill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mirandayaver exactly - that's part of the tragedy of all this. amidst the furor about the committee's (abusive) handling of the sexual assault allegations, we have utterly forgotten all the other powerful reasons for his rejection.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yascha_Mounk OK - but imagine it could. (just as a thought experiment). I'm curious what you thought about the democratic cost to that strategy. thx.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mirandayaver Yeah, and when the person in question comports himself like an entitled, partisan hack. ... its easy to forget, now, that there were so many reasons to question his judgment even before the sexual assault allegations ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yascha_Mounk Hi Yascha. I appreciate this thread - very clear-minded. Question: what do you feel about attempting to impeach Kavanaugh (for perjury, for example) after the fact? There will surely be a push, but not without democratic cost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mirandayaver Yes - also, the fact that there are competing stories, doesn't mean you throw up your hands and give up. Instead, you excercise good judgment. That's part of the point of having a representative body in the first place...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UnlawfulEntries yes - and good for you. We have a lot of pressure now, as a progressive community, to turn our sense of outrage into positive action. Its so important to find a constructive outlet...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. I'm pretty sure that covering a woman's mouth to suppress her screams 'perfectly encapsulates the Republican Party'.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>First as tragedy; second as farce ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's important is to realize this is not unique to China. Democracies worldwide (and esp the US) increasingly use 'digital dictatorship' tactics that undermine civil liberties. This issue is critical and urgent.  I talk about this in my book:  https://t.co/O3CuvjqcvY<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JonnyGeller Perhaps. But a case can also be made for ‘woke’.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes - a tough balance. And I think I’m more likely than most political theorists to talk about ‘method’. But i think it’s doable. ... also, you can talk about archival research in the third person! ... ‘this research entailed ...’<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@desireejweber @prof_mirya And the more generous we are with details, the more others can learn from our success (and mistakes). Political field would be a much better field, IMHO, if we were all more forthcoming about our process ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@desireejweber @prof_mirya Great Qs! I agree it’s tough to strike the right balance. Too boasty is not good. But I think it’s important even in political theory to talk about the archive process, or the challenges of translation etc. It’s hard - but can also produce very good writing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>... I also fear that grad students are discouraged from doing laborious fieldwork, bc they think it isn’t worth the investment. But this is a mistake - insight-generative footwork is essential for the discipline. Featuring this in articles is one way to foreground its value 3/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@prof_mirya archives or field, etc ... also, they are good stories! I understand the urge to make articles more formal, and less personal. But a little story telling can go a long way towards making our articles interesting, esp to people out of discipline 2/<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RamGanohariti Great question - generally I didn’t look at cross border reservations. But it’s a very important issue. An interesting case is The Tohono O’odham people along the US-México border. Some interesting work on this done by @madsen34geog ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For those interested in progressive ways to think about border security, I have a piece in this collection - "Beyond Sovereign Exclusion: Progressive Alternatives to the Wall".  https://t.co/AWC0kwBrVW with @reecejhawaii @madsen34geog @JLatAmGeog   https://t.co/pgFtZBBBjP  https://t.co/YwV3nBBLVQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatBlanchfield @alixabeth @sarahljaffe @UnlawfulEntries Foucault is a great place to start, especially his Security, Territory, Population, as is Jim Scott's work on legibility in Seeing like a State. I write about the new questions posed by Big Data in my book, The Politics of Borders:  https://t.co/1lZZaNqm04<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatBlanchfield @alixabeth @sarahljaffe @UnlawfulEntries @alixabeth - thanks for including me on this thread. The question of internalized borders is an important one - and rapidly evolving due to the rise of "Big Data". The state's desire to replicate its borders internally is not new, but its capabilities are shifting profoundly.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HuuDijstelbloem @deGoede9 @PollyWilkins @ikkibop @beste_isleyen Nice action shot. I am clearly exercised by the discussion...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Now is the time for this debate, while the world is still watching. Because if we let the issue slip away, we may not get the opportunity again. For those interested in the politics (and ethics) of bordering. I have written about this here:  https://t.co/e2azpJKxB9  6/7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What we want now is to use this momentum to really open a discussion about what borders should look like and what policies we should support. We don't discuss this in popular forums (with nearly enough detail); and political theory/science has all but ignored the issue  5/7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>indignation. But the problem now is what we do with this. The mistake would be to use this as a platform to articulate the (extremely valid) anger we feel towards Trump, but then turn away once we return to the status quo, or a new issue takes our attention  4/7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>where logics of equality and liberty are subservient to logics of security. Even the most democratic of societies is illiberal at its edge. Child separations are just the newest and most heinous iteration of this reality. It is good that the issue has galvanized so much  3/7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At the US border we routinely detain, grossly mistreat or deny basic rights to migrants, including those fleeing some of the most dangerous places on earth. This is what borders do, and have done for years - including under presidents Obama and Clinton. Borders are places  2/7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BostonReview just RT'd my article (below). Seems the right time to say a few words about the child separations at the border - certainly some of the most heartbreaking stories i've ever encountered. But it is important to keep it all in perspective. A lot of this isn't new  1/7  https://t.co/u0z5JIyMNv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tmbejan Yeah, I'd say so .... Seems your meditations are both *untimely* and *timeless* ...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@povertyscholar @cmMcConnaughy @LilyMasonPhD @CambridgeUP @Twitter @julillykh @SSNScholars @HealthPolicyHub @tampabay_health @CornellMedia @ssn Fantastic thread - I have spent the better part of this year on book publicity (1st book), and it has been a struggle.

<|startoftext|>@ClintSmithIII Yes - an important corrective to neoliberal ways of thinking about race - in fact, the ills of racism cannot be "cured" by wealth ... Otherwise put: black kids suffer structural challenges that are wealth insensitive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@giannaenglert That makes PPE even more attractive - discussants are great in principle, but they take up too much time on panels (which already have too many papers, and so are spread out) ... I would be thrilled if APSA started to follow the model of these smaller conferences.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@giannaenglert Interesting to note ... I feel similarly strongly about the APT conference at Oxford held each January - small rooms, with concentrated discussions of single papers (rather than panels). Its the most intimate political theory forum I've encountered...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BMcGinnis2 Yes - more generally, this is the issue with the 'broken windows' approach to discipline - if races are treated unequally, then small infractions will be punished unequally ... (A fact itself biased by what we consider to be relevant windows, and what counts as broken) ...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kwcollins @julie_wronski @LilyMasonPhD @cmMcConnaughy @Journal_PoPs Exactly - that's why this is a perfect moment to consider a conceptual disaggregation - perhaps by 'thickening' what we mean by affiliation, which has become too formal, or reconsidering how identities and affiliations are mutually generative/co-constitutive, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kwcollins @julie_wronski @LilyMasonPhD @cmMcConnaughy @Journal_PoPs Important thread ... Another thing that bothers me is the slippage between "identity" and "affiliation" - they are both forms of belonging, but the one doesn't distill to the other.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@84Mand @alixmortimer Hi - yes. That’s exactly the fear, that the US is turning Mexico into its buffer zone as a way of extending its hegemonic interests ... very similar to Imperial Roman and Chinese strategies ... in this, The Wall is something of a distraction ...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@84Mand @alixmortimer And, this is the thing about walls more generally, often misunderstood. Historically, they were designed more for taxation purposes (to keep people in!) rather than barriers (to keep people out). Their military function was not to fix boundaries, but to help expand beyond them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@84Mand @alixmortimer Interesting thread - thanks for pointing it out, Amanda. Yes, the point about hard borders is true. And Hadrian’s wall was essentially a place where troops could regroup, before heading out again. It is sometimes referred to as a ‘launching off’ point.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Geopolitics2020 @RDandurand @UQAM This looks fantastic ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LorenaCassady I agree. I think it would also be helpful to publish a list of places that indie authors should go to offer reviews. (Apologies if you have already done this!)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>hero.  https://t.co/Z9005Lb9aW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@woodruffbets Yes - very important. At the border, the national/international distinction, especially vis-a-vis intelligence, is blurred.

<|startoftext|>@nachoaguilar This is preposterous... border walls are not a panacea and do not warrant their cost. All security practitioners know this.

<|startoftext|>@LorenaCassady Yes - this is so important, good that you are promoting this ... academics face a similar uphill climb getting their works out into the world and can only do so with the help of reviews ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Carnival politics are the best politics ...  https://t.co/myP3YP7UoW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@7piliers @CaitLChandler @irinnews Agreed. A central problem w intensified border security initiatives is that they actually help gangs/cartels, as migrants are forced to take more dangerous routes.

<|startoftext|>Exceptional map/graphics ... the sheer density of migrant deaths around Malta is breathtaking...  https://t.co/FkaBtZpKVB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maya_sen yes - a huge challenge given social media. Calling people out incentivizes them to defend their position (perhaps even more abusively).

<|startoftext|>@CharoShane @EaterofSoles Yes. so much of the future of female empowerment at the workplace (and in general) that may come from #metoo depends on converting this social media 'voice' into institutional 'power' ... how this might happen has to be the primary focus of these campaigns going forward.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@reecejhawaii @SaskiaSassen Yes - great book ... Poverty is the root of nearly all attempts to restrict freedom of movement ... in the US we had ‘indigent’ laws ... This was the subject of one of the first pieces I published in grad school:  https://t.co/MjOMwSmp8x<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JFCrisp @PhilippeMFrowd @scmrjems Agreed. this is a critical challenge facing humanitarian groups: i.e. between appearing objective (in this context, statist) and picking sides (here: compassionate; favouring human rights) ... but at this point isn’t branding *also* necessarily sensitive to public opinion?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@j_hagenzanker @MigrantVoiceUK @heavencrawley @fduvell @si_mcmahon @nandosigona Looks excellent ...

<|startoftext|>@JFCrisp @PhilippeMFrowd @scmrjems And adding another shameless plug, I make this point at length in my new book: The Politics of Borders (CUP 2018):   https://t.co/3B7wB2cXAO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JFCrisp @PhilippeMFrowd @scmrjems I think the question of branding for migration/refugees is overblown - I doubt a new campaign would have much effect as views are so fixed. The more productive thing would be to refocus the debate on the harms/issues of border security - here public views are much less fixed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DamonLinker @DavidAvromBell For readers of this thread concerned with the problem of expansive and vague authority protocols in border enforcement, you might be interested in my new book - The Politics of Borders (CUP 2018):   https://t.co/3B7wB2cXAO<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@emayfarris No shame there. That's a badge of honor i would wear proudly...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ianbremmer @SevaUT Yes. We are so primed to assume that authoritarians are evil, we underestimate their popularity (even if driven by fear) ... What is most important about initial opp protests is that they are big enough to seem "real", even if not as big as gov rallies ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ltthompso Yes. This is the same mistake the Egyptian gov made in 2011, cutting off the internet (putatively to halt opp communication) which left hundreds of thousands of people angry and bored and more likely to take to the streets ... shortsighted, but common authoritarian tactic ...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@reecejhawaii One of the things people have the hardest time understanding about the harms of border control: it’s not just draconian laws; its selective enforcement.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MikaSpencer Thanks - eager to hear what you think! ... and yes, I would actually go further and say that the wall isn’t remotely the most concerning aspect of our border policy, even though it sucks up all the attention ... the deeper you dig, the more troubling things you find ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikaSpencer Yes - the wall! Trump’s vanity project ... if you’re looking for arguments for why it is stupid and wasteful (and not even the most worrying thing we are doing at the border) you should check out my book ...   https://t.co/dKFaBj5geJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattyglesias There was no room in the inn, even though there was lots of room in the inn ... even though the inn has five states worth of empty land and in the middle is a goddamn prairie...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fawfulfan The same is true of the drug war (of which homelessness is also a symptom). The cost of criminalisation is exhorbitant, and better spent on rehabilitation ... in our inability to admit failure, we perpetuate it ... Truly sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@janmpdx Ah, perfect. Cover art for my new book, ‘Hipster Leviathan’ ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachelheldevans Yes. The great unexpected (at least by me) consequence of the internet is that it has for many replaced the church as the principle forum for Manichaean thought ... and with that, exclusion and othering.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrBriePhD It’s a big question. We on the left have a lot to figure out about ‘18 ... whether to go progressive and aim for agenda, or go pragmatic and aim for seats ... (recognising, of course, that it’s not a clean dichotomy, esp now)  ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenKamalaHarris @AnneMorrowCoop1 I agree. Of all the horrible news about borders/immigration, this is the hardest to bear... it hits people where the heart is softest. It punishes them for the strongest, most instinctual forms of attachment. Truly cruel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrAdrianBlau I totally agree - you have to take an instrumental approach towards any of his so-called 'principled' stands ... What surprises me here is that I don't even understand this move instrumentally ... I'm really lost, unless it's simply ego-for-egos sake ... (which seems likely) ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrAdrianBlau Agreed. This is actually one of the moves that's hardest for me to get my mind around. I get the cult-of-personality mania. But given his obsession with the sanctity of the flag, I would think the same would go for "e pluribus unum" ... But as usual, my instincts betray me ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only car I could ever love ...  https://t.co/EuRT5Kkf6E<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reecejhawaii What no bestsellers? ... your next book should be a mystery/thriller, staged around an incident at the border ... that’ll give you an Amazon bump ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reecejhawaii Ha! Thanks ... I was curious about how to decode those numbers ... they seemed to jump willynilly from 100k to 900k overnight, which didn’t make sense ... So it’s more of a predictive algorithm than a rank, per se ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattyglesias Yes. But this may be the least surprising development of the year. Isn’t this the classic “republicans fall in line” ? ... trump may be shaking things up, but the GOP is the damned same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peterwsinger Maybe so. We also appear to be seeing a radical departure between "fact" and "self-interest" ... I think this is the part I find so hard to fathom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NancyAHiemstra @HuffPostPol This is truly devastating, much more emotionally trying than most (even horrible) things in the news. I think the reason is this: it punishes people not simply for the fact of their immigrant status, but for affective bonds they cannot control ... That is so, so, so cruel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesSurowiecki @peterwsinger It also reflects a remarkable lack of concern for the fact that statements are recorded and can be marshalled in the future as seemingly irefutable and condemning evidence ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Layla_AlAmmar @MelissaLaurenE Yes, political. The fact that Roy Moore still hasn't conceded his senate seat in Alabama is a "sacrifarce" ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaoloBiondi82 @BramFrouws @JFCrisp Yes - "considering to leave" assumes free choice. It's also abstract - both b/c we consider many things that don't graft onto intentions; but also b/c it doesn't specify destination ... Do we really care about (constrained) considerations for unspecified outcomes? Horribly vague.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeonHusock That's a very interesting point. Maybe better expressed "fear of sameness," or more provocatively: "fear of identity."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>... because it would be tacky if they just wrote "CAPITAL" ...  https://t.co/oyWAxKIfAT<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lisambayer Especially for first-time authors that have few other means of publicity ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lisambayer I agree with all this in principle. But in practice, when I linked to the publisher, no image came up, only a long ugly link.
