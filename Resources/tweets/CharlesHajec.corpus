<|startoftext|>I also find it halarious that liberals think a Democratic president is the solution to all their problems. If history has taught me anything it’s that you too, will be let down #2020ElectionThoughts #Democrats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a cynical classical-liberal &amp; gun owner I find it haliaroius when republicans flock to gun stores whenever a liberal is elected into office. Talk about having zero faith in the system. @AP4Liberty #2020ElectionThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Juicy history: the election 1824: Henry Clay and JQ Adams steal the election from an unqualified Jackson. 4 years later Jackson wins &amp; ushers in an era of Nationalistic Populism disguised as conservatism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a classical liberal I love when politicians are voted out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you think the country is doomed because a candidate won a close election with massive voter turn out you don’t understand what makes this country awesome. I teach US Histry and Gov for a living and I’d be glad to explain some things to you. #america #trump #biden #vote #2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>American history is a 244 year example of liberalization. Each generation has embraced change it viewed as important. Progressiveism is American. Time has proved that conservatism is not sustainable. #2020Election #vote #progressive #classialliberal<|endoftext|>
