<|startoftext|>@dbongino I do! It’s about removing #DementiaJoe if they win. Then #Kamala puppet is Pres as proxy for #TeamCoup (lead by Obama)she’s the Trojan Horse bc she is all ambition w/out actually doing any work..very useful for the most corrupt President in History, Obama<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kirstiealley I don’t think your “Democrat friends” answered!

<|startoftext|>@kirstiealley *they know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mkraju So it’s about #Biden if they win. They’re always looking out for themselves in the most obtuse maniacal way. They’re never honest or straightforward about their goals bc they’d NEVER get elected if they were. Meanwhile Americans need economic help NOT GAMES<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DevinClogged @AbernatheyScott @Pepe_MAGA_anon @XRPETE1 @NAdiffrence @PressSec Not true.

<|startoftext|>@KTLAMorningNews A total of 98 deaths total since March in a county of 3 million ppl. Of those 98, 20 came from skilled nursing facilities &amp; were dying w/ serious illnesses prior to #Covid.

<|startoftext|>@AmyZax1 @GavinNewsom OC did 775 tests Tuesday so you have wrong  https://t.co/5kJwbCLegM OC tests are 86,694 w/ 4,742 positive &amp; 98 deaths since March 1.

<|startoftext|>@seanvwork @GustavoArellano You’d think the media would give ALL THE FACTS BUT NO... I guess Gustavo likes dunking on his hometown bc @latimes hates OC.

<|startoftext|>@GustavoArellano More cases because more testing! Most are asymptomatic! numbers in #OC hospitals still &amp; have been always VERY LOW. less than 150 ppl total in all 5 major OC hospitals..ICU &amp; deaths have been ppl w/ SERIOUS health probs PRIOR &amp; 85% over 83 years old. #OpenOC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KFIAM640 Now post an age distribution (mostly over 80 years old in ICU) &amp; how many were already on hospice, have serious medical issues prior to covid &amp; from skilled nursing facilities where they had months to live? Why no specifics?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan The legacy media (98% of media) never holds Democrats accountable. It is telling that they don’t act w/ integrity unless they’re forced.

<|startoftext|>@HourlyStruggle @charliekirk11 @JW_Watch That may be but I witnessed massive cheating by Democrats in irvine by stealing ballots from mailrooms at large irvine co. apartment complexes  where USPS leaves mail out that has no forward order. Mimi won &amp; then after days, she lost? Not likely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OConnellRonnie @charliekirk11 True. Same for Mimi Walters a stellar individual. She won as predicted until they stole it after the fact. Now we have a commie carpet bagger slug representing us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 NOT coincidence. I witnessed cheating.

<|startoftext|>@Joseph_Meidl @RyanAFournier I understand your concern &amp; I suppose that could happen &amp; would be as much a tragedy as any loss of life. you can’t control or support all people &amp; I believe we need laws that are enforced as ethically as possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TN_Girl_4_Life @juella_ No idea. Insanity &amp; the newspapers in California employ only progressives who won’t dare criticize progressive politicians lest the all lose power! It’s beyond frustrating to be held hostage by corrupt morons. #CADemsAreTheWorst<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joseph_Meidl @RyanAFournier the focus is massive fraud going on with “birthing tourism.” It is costing taxpayers of California greatly in increased medical costs. The Chinese women are wealthy, get expensive care, shop at posh boutiques &amp; cancel CCs after.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joseph_Meidl @RyanAFournier It’s a huge problem. Wealthy Chinese families are using our resources to buy citizenship. this isn’t migrants. Google “birthing vacations.” Apartments in CA are filled w/ pregnant Chinese women who pay to have baby get US citizenship &amp; sponsor them later.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanAFournier Great! In CA, pregnant Chinese women on “birthing vacations” fill apt. buildings. Their handlers seem like criminals. they cancel credit cards after giving birth. hospitals &amp; taxpayers are left to cover. Baby gets US citizenship/sponsors parents when 18.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CNN Agree. They use her to read UN Climate activists &amp; her father’s words because the nonsense can’t be questioned bc she is A CHILD! It is absurd. Her passion for science &amp; economics should be encouraged by sending her to University to build on her interests.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@yashar handing out hundreds of pens as souvenirs...SO bizarre. Why waste tax $ on unnecessary nonsense? The #Democrats don’t govern at this point, and no one in #media is shaming them, so 100% of time is spent on THEIR political careers. #Pelosi<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WashTimes #FreeIran #IranProtests Stop allowing the NIAC to spew Iranian Regime #propaganda on our #media w/ support of Ilhan Omar &amp; Tlaib. It is outrageous they’re allowed to lie &amp; get no pushback @MeetThePress @jaketapper @TuckerCarlson @CBS_Herridge @gmanews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCWorld The opposite of anything @SpeakerPelosi says. He’s their punching bag bc they can’t beat Trump w/ their ideas because they only are about politics &amp; not governing. She’s had decades to help her voters &amp; has destroyed San Francisco. #CADemocratsFail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveScalise Does this shield them from being called to testify? Can’t imagine the Senate taking any of this sham House charade seriously after the House went against all precedent &amp; pushed an objectively unfair process that found no criminal behavior.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NikkiHaley Makes complete sense. Our #media allows her to get funding &amp; align w/ enemies of the Iranian people who are desperately fighting for basic human rights. She is close to NIAC propagandists who US media allow to disseminate #Iranian Regime  #propaganda here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews @jeremycorbyn A baseless smear of the British public, press &amp; Royal Family. Not surprising. #Corbyn always views everyone through a Lefty identity politics lens.

<|startoftext|>@esaagar What the truly shabby bit about it is Prince Harry canceled going to a big Marine to do that night &amp; he is a Major General in the Marines &amp; chose networking w/ Beyoncé &amp; Disney CEO for Meghan.

<|startoftext|>@AddinellMichael @piersmorgan Agree! Of course they can make their choices as adults. I just believe they treated Harry’s family poorly the way they broke this news. It seems they want to use Royal titles as a “brand” for income. Certainly that will be up to the Queen &amp; taxpayers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan @CNN What do you expect from CNN?   Many of their entitled privileged &amp; unqualified “journalists” say they are victims too!

<|startoftext|>@BuckSexton It’s also an endlessly lucrative money laundering scheme &amp; moral shield for progressives to assuage guilt for their lives of global excess. Like Clinton sending tweets about Climate from Epstein’s perv jet..JUST HELPING HUMANITY!  @EcoSenseNow @tan123<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@esqonfire I Know NO Democrat, Independent or GOP friends, who believe President Trump should be impeached. Democrats have zero credibility after Kavanaugh &amp; Mueller nonsense.

<|startoftext|>@ShellenbergerMD @HMDatMI Also, in CA getting free coverage after #ACA started is easier than most states. ppl RELOCATED here for drug rehab.
