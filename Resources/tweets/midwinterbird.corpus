<|startoftext|>@nytimes Ay no that’s so disgusting. I understand mourning. It doesn’t help your pain to put other people in your level of pain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump sees victory and struggling democrats. I see hard working people to make triple sure the election is FAIR. Trump will take any strength and turn it into weakness. His narcissism is gaslighting the elections. #IowaCaucuses #ChristiansAgainstTrump<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>“Food stamps” go to people who are in need. Then, the money goes to their local supermarket. The supermarket can stay in business, funding employees &amp; then the economy.

<|startoftext|>@michaelsayman I’ve voiced this before. Because the polls all said she was already a winner. And that there wasn’t much to worry about.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TerrySc24806954 @cher Wtf... why watch the leader of the free world if you think he’s high? Uhhh because this needs to be witnessed and called out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy shit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So another quid pro quo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HoarseWisperer No different.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At age 11, I looked out the window and decided I was going to marry the boy next door. We hadn’t met. 3 years later we finally meet (different schools, shy, etc.) and today we’ve been together 20 years, have two kids, and run a company together.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BusyPhilipps I’m such a little crazy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So wise. So graceful. So obviously worthy to be the leader of the free world. 🙄🙄🙄🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@johnkrasinski ... but intrigued. Why do I do this to myself, Jimbo? Jimothy...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnkrasinski I’ve never been affected by a movie like I was affected by The Quiet Place. I felt emotionally scarred! I’d say that means it was THAT well done. But now I’m terrified to see more.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SarahKSilverman My Mother, a Trump enthusiast, says they’re much better off in this mess than what they were living with. Sickening. I know she would have hated this if Obama did it.

<|startoftext|>New York City is absolutely fascinating. It has history, thousands of accents, and everyone seems 100% cool with having zero personal space. Much respect. #nyc #lowereastside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBCNews I mean... it’s kinda impressive. Hilarious, fucked up, and genius. I give this a 10/10<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonSCampbell Speed. Or... nonsense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is factual.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We need some seriously higher standards for #potus. Anything less corrupt than the current administration is now acceptable? We need a leader with genuine love of other people, wisdom, genuine compassion and empathy. A leader with just a fucking brain is not enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theofficenbc Hey now! A kiss is a kiss! Don’t take this from us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cubsfan122112 @jennafischer He looks surprised... hmmm I wonder if it was a scripted kiss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrissyteigen Keep it bright white plsssss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh no<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoodGravyGoose @JoeBiden But I still do think he is refreshing. You took my tweet the wrong way. It’s sad that HE is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It says something if @JoeBiden seems refreshing. Remember the hilarious joe Biden memes?! The weird close up talking and over touching? The dumbness? But here we are.
