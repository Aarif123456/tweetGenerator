<|startoftext|>anything for some fast cash i see<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GangWeedMan @Cehlub @Kiwiz he would have if they met up in person don’t actually dumb, even if she was “14” he was 19 that’s still fucking weird and highly illegal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GangWeedMan @Cehlub @Kiwiz he was preying on a whole CHILD for two years, no minors should be working with him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>full context  https://t.co/79gP3gGoi1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@strawberbri wait eww why are people doing that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NlCOLES i read that bpd and autism in girls have very similar symptoms so it’s hard to diagnose it so they usually just start off with a simpler diagnosis like gad and depression. some professionals even refuse to diagnose bpd so idk honestly hopefully we can find the proper help we need<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cehlub @Kiwiz you are young but please do not work with that man anymore, find a new mentor. you might think it’s okay bc he is nice to you but it could be a form of grooming. i highly recommend finding someone else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AceSpadesArt yup some influencers deserve jail time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpinaSoul he is victimizing himself tho, he went from i’ll take accountability to talking about how this effective him negatively when it’s his fault. no 19 year old should be sending nudes to a 12 year old<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpinaSoul he basically groomed a child for two years and sent her nudes, admitted to it and then now trying to play the victim. i feel bad for his family but his girlfriend is choosing to protect a pedo so that’s on her<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cinnamarolI @occultdolls it lasted for two years so He was grooming her when he was 19 also<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@occultdolls @cinnamarolI he pretty much played the victim card saying he got ptsd from being called out as a pedo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KittyAngie_ @LiIAssX he is a pedo and trying to use “i’m a victim of ptsd, trolling and ect.” as a way out of taking accountability<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fxtterr @Kiwiz it was 3 years ago also when he was 19 sending nudes to a 12 year old, you still support him tho?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AceSpadesArt ofc people will say he changed, they already excusing it in the comments when he was doing it from when he was 17-19 years old. he is trying to make it seem like it was 5 years ago and trying to play the victim card<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VaIxntin it’s pretty much just “i’m going to take responsibility” then went to a “i have ptsd been doxxed and my life is soo bad” mfer is a pedo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Latenci_ NOTHING BUT FACTS 🗣🗣🗣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>tw // suicide mention   thisss!!!!!!!  I have seen an outrageous amount of cis males try to blame female for the suicide rate rather than focusing on the real issue and trying to find a solution on how to make the rate become lower.  https://t.co/BMv1M5zhgl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>although mr.zhongli is also a trader, he isn’t as bad bc he protected that land for 3k years. and he didn’t try to openly kill me so he gets a pass for right now...i’ll keep an eye out for him tho 👁👄👁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>genshin spoiler //  i use to love childe until he tried to murder us three times in a row, tried to destroy a whole town by awaken a god, failing, and then pretending like everything was cool and we are friends...all his attractiveness just crumbled, he is dead to me.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dayoffgoth wow really?? that’s so wrong of professional to do that. my therapist is really new to her job so maybe that’s why, i tried to explain to her i have abandonment issues really bad and she was like okay just try to use a coping mechanism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and i feel like that why their help wasn’t actually doing anything for me bc they diagnosed me wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>they diagnosed me with gad and clinical depression but i feel like i have bpd. my symptoms fall more into that category<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i think i’m going to find a new therapist and psychiatrist bc i don’t know but i feel like they might have diagnosed me wrong and i want a second opinion<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EdMeister01 definitely and some people don’t even need college like some jobs just want a certain license to take classes of or a trade school. or no prior education. just depends on the field and job type.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>you don’t have to go to college right after high school. take a gap year if you need. find yourself and then start going to college for something you are passionate for because college will burn you out fast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if you don’t need college, don’t waste ur money on it trust me. if you get college for free definitely go and experience it but if you gotta pay for it and you aren’t sure about what degree you want to go for don’t waste the money.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DPN098 you clearly can’t read so i’m going to end the conversation here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPN098 she’s literally a grown women, she’s 30 years old. dylan is 10 years younger than her. she literally DOXXED him and exposed his information to 13k followers yet you think he is the only problem?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HeyImAmethyst44 @Future44111 @TheCreeperKin11 @ExiledPanda @beaustanaccount @stardewleaf she deactivated after rting doxxed information of dylan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xparacosm @pieroalec @stardewleaf no she deactivated after she rted doxxed information of dylan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InhaletoExhale she literally DOXXED people????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Arleanabb @joaquim6667 i been using spotify since 2016 and remembered it would show the stats and who was ur top artist as a slide show. I thought that’s what she was talking about. if she added an image of it i would’ve been able to visualize it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LampMado @stardewleaf it’s not her joke to make, if it was a joke about being bi that’s fine but shes not gay so she shouldn’t be making jokes about that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stardewleaf bi people can be homophobic tho? it doesn’t just cancel it out. you need validation because you are wrong. no one invalidated you being bi, everyone pointed out that you were being homophobic.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ExtraDespresso I have the black one!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hello! I have been following your tweets for the past two days, and have come to the conclusion you do not deserve to have Raymond on your island. He is my comfort character and seeing him in an environment not meant for him brings me anxiety, so I will be expecting a reply<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I still to this day don't know why I got so many death threats and hate for it but I still find it funny 💀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gamergf420 Yes and she started beefing with Ariana Grande jdjfbdjdn<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@glintisland A COMPOST PILE DJDNDBD💀💀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Their house probably smells like straight piss bc I never see any of them with a toilet or litter box, they probably shitting on their yard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SolRecall They have eye crustys like this I can tell  https://t.co/o1rjb1Ky9u<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Villagers in animal crossing gotta smell like straight ass, they probably don't shower and got those crustys on their eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@freep I have never went there and now I'm definitely not going there, this is concerning 😐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am going to stream all my favorite flash games before they go into the void, when should I stream it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imma just go cry in my little corner now  https://t.co/IWVzdXCgYs<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Trip to Japan next year is a MUST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pomelopaints Discount ditto all the way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@augustbythepond I'm sorry for being so understanding<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interacting with her is causing her fans to go out of their way to harass poc in the Fandom and only causing more issues. Just leave it alone everything has been said and done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know a majority of my following is animal crossing accounts and I'll only say this once, stop interacting with the stardewleaf girl and her fans. The proof is already out that she's a racist, her fans don't care. Just let this shit die down so she become irrelevant again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤶 Mrs. Clause is here 🤶 Drop your Amazon wishlist below and I will choose one persons list and buy them a gift, will be choosing tomorrow 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>when i finish my island, I will twitch stream it and we can have alittle tour and do some villager hunting :3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i been seeing tweets sending hate to people bc they entered j stars giveaway for money and its stupid like get ur money up not ur funny up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>look if you follow/rt problematic people bc they are doing money giveaways thats cool idrc. its hard out here and that extra 1k could help you out alot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Britt_wa Do it do it do it<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ah yes  https://t.co/Y5ghvbJeIO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can we talk about how Nintendo ads are always adults playing animal crossing, like they are aware of their fanbase and recognize that yes it's a kids game but more adults are appealed to it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is like 4 feet tall and it's heavy asf, made out of pure stainless steel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ready for the new attack on Titan season  https://t.co/CxEKzgSBk0<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If you are not going to wear a mask, you don't need to be at a grocery store.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ALANABOOPS Turn off ur dms and mute any tweet that have mentjons of her also make all ur tweets so followers can only reply or go private.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>85% of drama could have been dealt with via dms but alot of people on here are clout chases and like to harass people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It seems like alot of people expect everyone knows what drama is going on and gets angry at people for following or remaining friends with the person is really none of your business.?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>White people in this community are easily manipulated and will agree to anything a POC tell thems even if it's wrong or they disagree. I seen this happen multiple times bc they are scared of getting cancelled lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This community cancels alot of people over stupid shit bc they are sensitive, I've seen some dumbass drama that makes me question if some of yall deadass are serious or not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The community sleeps on Villagers that are unpopular bc pointing out they like___ character will make people disagree with them and they can't handle someone not agreeing with them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Raymond only became popular because someone put him into a maid outfit but other than that he is a boring character and was never worth the thousands of nmt people spent on him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No nuance November but on animal crossing Twitter, no one asked but I'm here to give my opinions anyways 💕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@infilraid Lol ur whole account is just rting giveaways get ur money up son<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Other people's alts: I'm so sad *NSFW post*  Me:  https://t.co/u6q7hJ1DQZ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Worcatem @stardewleaf Ditto<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PunishedGuru This is possibly one of the worst takes on twitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I made a discord server (link will expire in a day) just for my youtube and twitch but its a chill out so everyone is welcomed.  please read the roles then choose ur roles! see ya there!  https://t.co/sQT0FS0zmT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@barcodetattoo92 They literally archived the tweets with the replies and that Instagram is hers lol ur in denial.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>my first time seeing this in game  #AnimalCrossing #ACNH #NintendoSwitch  https://t.co/NgbPsXqaxW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the total is...565 hours 😀  https://t.co/Oru7AqlcIi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm about to check how many hours I have on animal crossing on both my switches.....I don't want to see<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kKAIslider Don't force yourself Kai!! If you aren't feeling well take a day off if you need :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@titanialynida Yup, people never want to take responsibility for their actions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mx_Zan Yes I love the main characters so much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NETFLlXUS She went private bc she's guilty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🎤sawarasenai🥰kimi😸wa⛓shoujo👻na💅no? ✨böKù🌸Wâ🧚ÿARiçHiñ🤴BįCChī😾ńO😩oSû🚣Dà🎉YO💦<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the stardewleaf girl who wore the afro puffs and called them space buns is now proven to be the same girl who was posting the n word and attacking people by being racist....and her followers are most likely still going to support her bc they are all racist. I hate twitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also Ouran but I don't watch all the episodes I just watch the ones I like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A silent voice, blue spring ride, angel beats and madoka magica. I rewatch them like once a year 💀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VelvetIsCake Cake and golden apple<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MyAnimeContent I don't know how anyone can like asuna, she's personally so irratating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eustass824 You already know I'm going to say avatar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Twitter legitimately just isn't fun anymore because people take shit way too literally. I can't even post copy pasta anymore without people crying in my mentions it's annoying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The two people who share my birthday are the most chaotic and problematic people to exist i-  https://t.co/PnmBd7xg0w<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>DEAR ALL WOMEN: Pokémon is not a real game. Animal Crossing is not a real game.The Sims is not a real game.Mario is not a real game.Stardew valley is not a real game. Mobile games are NOT.REAL. GAMES. put down the baby games and play something that requires challenge and skill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@josie_ferngrove I'm so sick of all these people who think they're gamers. No, you're not. Most of you are not even close to being gamers. I see these people saying "I put well over 100hrs in this game and it's great!" That's nothing, most of us can easily out 300+ in all our games.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Kitten_AC YES YES YES<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TravelingBeing @renfamous It's robots, I don't think Twitter even has a direct team it's almost impossible to get help on here and when you do its months later<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMadz My brain says: open it make blue go away.  So I open it then I refresh n the cycle restarts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a huge reason why I stopped using snapchat bc my brain sees any form of a notification and it needs to be opened :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sorry if you see me open ur fleet fast asf and as the first person seeing the blue around the circle bothers me so I have to open them hfjdf<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If you are white, that's fine as long as you educate yourself on topics that don't affect you but do affect others. Give others voices to speak and fight against injustice that your people have created.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I remember when I use to tweet just for likes, my tweets were awful but would constantly blow up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Twitter is really "do I make shitty tweets that I know will blow up but are corny" or "make shit post and only get 3 likes but show a sense of true self"<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Why you should add ur pronouns to ur bio? Everyone has preferred pronouns so to make it easier for other to be able to call you what you would like to be called. Also people try to target people with pronouns so if everyone has them in their bio they can't target everyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Add ur pronouns to ur bio, ain't no s/h or h/h. spell it out ex. she/her also dont put it in ur location just ur bio because you can get suspended for having an invalid location<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kaiascrossing But if those third party was going to vote against biden anyways he would lose on a bigger margin rather than a smaller margin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump seems like a cod player<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You down really bad just give it up you look like a pussy lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I understand why people say it's throwing ur vote away but if they were going to vote for trump but then gave it to someone else it helped trump lose<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Wiesner_Colten @ains_rose thats very interesting considering the fact that he is trying to make it harder for lgbt+ to be able to adopt also made it possible for health professionals to reject a trans person of treatment also rejected trans from being in the military.....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@VaIxntin i thought he was in jail for a year at one point. he really went for being the biggest trump hater to a trump supporter reallll quick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VaIxntin he doesn’t even make the required threshold of biden’s proposal, he either wants clout or they paying him 🤷🏻‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ESPECIALLY IF U ARE A CIS MALE YOU DONT HAVE ANY SAY ON A WOMAN BODY OR CHOICES.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if it’s not ur body then shut the fuck up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anteikue i just be thinking like what tweet made them unfollow lmaooo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>my fault for thinking my mutuals are all my friends tho like we just be vibin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>not me thinking i’m cool with someone and then they break the mutual 💀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VaIxntin i wanted bernie so badly but american really let him down<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notsorrydad 🥺 aweee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VaIxntin yee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Archiebunk88 jobs that offer health insurance usually require you to work full time which most college students work part time bc they are busy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i mentioned multiple times that health care for individuals 18-26 is on the line if trump wins because he wants to overthrow the affordable healthcare act so if you are on ur parents insurance and voted for trump u are voting against urself 😐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RosieACNH_ yaaaayyyy letsss goooo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if you follow me n you voted for trump unfollow me immediately as you truly do not give a flying fuck about me or my health thanks 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chasiecrossing i hope they don’t follow me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acnheunoia thank you<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>of course the fuckers behind me didn’t get the message and keeps inching closer to me 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marenaltman yessss queeennn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>everyone is social distancing and wearing a mask which is a good sign and i’m glad about<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the line is HUGE i was not expecting this usually when i vote barely anyone shows up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>off to go vote, hopefully the trumpies don’t try to attack me 😎👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notsorrydad he isn’t even in the tax range for biden plan to effect him. I don’t think this will do much for his career especially if trump loses people will remember that he endorsed him n not want to support him at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notsorrydad ONE MILLI??? 👁👄👁  holyyy i can’t even imagine what some of the famous people who endorse are getting paid that’s insane<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>lil pump was anti trump for the longest time i bet they had to pull out some bands like “we will pay you for endorsement” n he grabbed that shit n ran with it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bro how much are they paying this man to do this shit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i’m sorry i’m very anxious over the presidential election and making a lot of tweets about it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the video i look ugly in on tiktok is blowing up BFJDBSH i did speak some facts tho<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OM3NITY i don’t think i have the patience to deal with people like that especially not early in the morning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>what y’all call it?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@southburd its not necessarily new but a lot of people are uneducated on the topic and more reports are coming out of people who are legal citizens being detained for crimes they committed almost 20 years ago it’s insane.  https://t.co/dTcCZutfrD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@southburd that was my tweet, i was talking about how they been detaining people who have green cards and how the supreme court wants to be able to deport those people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>idk if the supreme court passed it yet but they want to make it possible to even deport a person with a green card...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>just alittle fact: ICE can detain you even if you have ur green card....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatyMagNaves @canadiangirly74 @JoeBiden wait till u find out that ICE couldnt careless and has detained people who are legal citizens 😳<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@flowersforkaine you don’t have to forgive him but he is trying to become a better person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flowersforkaine the car driver assault thing, justin never was charged for because the court ruled it as pretty much a lie. and justin making his racist comment was 10 years ago and has been a huge ally for the blm. he continues to apologize for his mistake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flowersforkaine i’m not going to argue with you but the “dui” was never charged he only got a reckless driving account n he was only on marijuana. the abortion statement he says “i can’t judge because i’m not in that situation” but everyone took the first sentence and that was 9 years ago<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrappeFizzy awee if you had/are having a good time then that’s all that matters but if they make you uncomfortable then make them go home 👍<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I gotten to that point in my life where I just want to change my number and delete my snapchat so no one who i grew up with can ever get ahold of me again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>eventually when i start making money thru twitch and youtube i want to help out the community more and have more giveaways and be able to donate more<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>it’s like a charity raffle :) i want to be able to use my community to help other communities and i feel like this is the perfect opportunity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>then they will dm me that they sent the money thru dms this will be part of a big prize so the prize can be anything from ac merch to in game items and then i will have a smaller prize (in game items) for only people who rted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>so i’m going to start doing giveaways again starting in november but these giveaways will be different. I want to be able to help charity as much as possible so i came up with an idea. i will post a link to a charity and people can donate any amount they want (c)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>do not give them anymore interactions then this only interact when a mutual interacts and explain why we no longer support this person. do not message them, do not try to get into contact, do not give them any interactions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>unfollow the person on EVERYTHING, block them if you need to. explain the situation to others so they are also aware of the situation. if you need to report this persons actions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First recognize the problem, dm the person and explain the situation allow them time for a response. allow them to explain themselves and give them time to change. if the continue behaviors start the next step.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>they are not going to change and are going to wait for everything to die down to restart their previous cycles of tearing people down. you have been warned<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>before i deactivate this account for good i just want to confirm that some of jess old friends are manipulating you guys and making apologies just because they don’t want to lose followers. they are still continuing to make fun of people in their private groupchats.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@clotteris @RosalindArdenAC @vesperiisms i agree, i hope those accounts never return back to ac twitter. me and my friends have been taking precautions since bc of it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RosalindArdenAC @clotteris @vesperiisms no it’s okay :) i just think it’s a misunderstanding and i probably didn’t explain myself well when I was in the situation because I was panicky but at the end of the day i don’t really speak to tossing anymore and i both spoke to tossing and jess privately on the matter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clotteris @RosalindArdenAC @vesperiisms the whole situation was handled incorrectly and i should’ve spoken to them in privately rather then go off in public but the whole situation was very overwhelming for me and i didn’t want that information on the timeline so of course i was upset which i had the right to be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clotteris @RosalindArdenAC @vesperiisms actually i did talk to tossing and explained it to her that what she did was wrong and that i was upset with her. My mentions were in shambles that day so I don’t remember exactly what you had said but jess did post the ss and i talked to jess about that privately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RosalindArdenAC @clotteris @vesperiisms these are my exact dms to jess about that situation and a ss of tossing apologizing to me for dming jess without my permission  https://t.co/Yum03obwcH<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I could truly careless about how many followers I have, I wanted to protect my groupchat. the two tweets under the main tweet, jess told me to tweet them so i did so she would leave me and my friends alone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>multiple accounts were being made threatening my friends and me begging to be in my gc, sending pictures of me and being really creepy. i deleted the thread to protect me and my friends and after it was deleted the accounts just stopped coming after us.  https://t.co/HDNlzgGdqI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>most of my friends were minors and because of the threads people were doxxing us, sending death threats, hacking into our accounts, so we had to move to discord because of what we were experiencing. the only way to make it stop was to agree to delete the threads. (c)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i really didn’t want to speak on this situation but i guess i have no other options<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>my dms are open and i’m willing to talk to anyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clotteris @vesperiisms that’s not true, my friend dmed jess without my permission nor my acknowledgement. i will dm you everything that actually happened if you are willing to listen.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>if a minor feels uncomfortable following an adult accept that and let them be, don’t bother the minor as they aren’t obligated to follow you or interact with you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>as an adult it’s okay to be in a groupchat with minors but be mindful of what you are saying and don’t speak about inappropriate things that you wouldn’t say around your little cousins or younger family members .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>we need to protect minors on here look out for warning signs of other adults and do our best to make boundaries with the minors.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Linzicrossing @faesprout could be a possibility<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>maybe if trump gave us the second stimulus check and told his minions to wear a mask he wouldn’t be in this predicament ✨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if i get suspended, twitter knows i was a real one ☝🏼<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>cute now explain why your discord mods were banning people for saying acab and why your mods have been racist?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@starbitcandies someone said that they are 13 so maybe they are just uneducated idk i have them muted anyways<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@starbitcandies she changed her name real quick 👀<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@soIitxa hi<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Zexion131 benny 🤡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jackensei ofc i respect that, just be careful with the wording bc minors could see it and take it the wrong way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jackensei arent even*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jackensei my school was the complete opposite they never spoke about sex ed and half the school got pregnant, it’s basically effective teaching and giving people the best possible advice/help that will prevent it. most people are even aware of all form of birth control.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@craziebunnie if you need someone to talk to, i’m here for u b<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jackensei and when they do speak on the dangers of the internet they make it corny and doesn’t hit the points that it should be hitting, if they were to educate and actually pay attention to the child then it would happen less.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jackensei it’s on education, minors should be educated on these topic and told the danger they will face if they pursue it but no one wants to speak on it bc it’s a “taboo topic” schools refuse to educate on sex ed but if they did, their will be less likely to get a std or pregnancy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jackensei i knew a girl in middle school who sent one sexualize picture to just one person and it ended up on porn sites so i think it’s best to try to get them help or to prevent it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jackensei no no no don’t give them that idea either, minors just shouldn’t be posting sexualize image in general bc it’s illegal doesn’t matter who it’s being sent to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if we are on discord and you tell me that I am being too loud I will scream into the damn mic, turn ur fucking volume down coward 😤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Naomi_am_Hogan i’m okay ty :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I’m not sure if it’s okay for me to move onto another community since most of my followers are from the ac community..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and all the tweet I do see are literally other tweets just rephrased. I don’t know if it’s okay if I tweet about other games and stuff since no one interacts with that either. I’m not sure what I have done entirely wrong or if the community is just gone and moved on from the game<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i’m kind of in a pickle, everytime I tweet about animal crossing it doesn’t do well no matter if it’s a giveaway, tweet, pictures ect and like the community is pretty much dead but since i’m not tweeting ac i’m losing followers but there isn’t much to tweet about anymore (c)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goIdiedog i hope it goes great and you get stuff you like :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goIdiedog happy birthday!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see people refusing to play animal crossing anymore because they hate the fandom like stop interacting with the fandom then and focus on playing the game. every fandom has shitty people it’s impossible to be in a fandom that doesn’t have some type of issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>you guys really need to learn how to separate the fandom and creators from the game/anime/whatever like you can still 100% enjoy something and not agree with the fanbase.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>sunshine alone goes for like 80$ on the gamecube.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>people are actually mad over the all star mario collection being 60$?? that makes each game like 20$ and if you actually had to buy the original game and console you would be spending 2x more.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@QuirkSensei i’m just now starting to catch-up on the manga and like I hope one of the students come to the realization and choose to turn bad it would be interesting 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>you know how hype it would be if some students from UA choose to become villains and go against their friends that plot twist would be crazy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish deku realizes that UA is a scam and that hero’s are actually villains in disguise and chooses to become part of the LOV and takes over the planet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PlutosHelmet you too :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@animalcrrsing i can’t even go a day<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@onyx_bolt its pretty obvious, i don’t think i have to write a whole paragraph explaining myself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@onyx_bolt because no said all men aint shit i just said it in general. if you take offense to it then you are part of the men who aren’t shit. it’s like saying all cops are bad. it’s obv not all cops are but the majority are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@onyx_bolt if you take it personal then that’s a you problem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@onyx_bolt they are terrible ✨<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IhnayaC oo i had no clue that could happen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RunicGEAR in general the fancy font causes issues for text to speech :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>asking respectfully, please do not use fonts in your name. It makes it impossible to listen to for people who use text to voice and for those who are visually impaired.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>trynna make a pumpkin patch in animal crossing, give us the pumpkins 😗🤲🏼<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>small accounts are suffering and this has to stop. everytime we tweet something it feels like we are talking to ourselves while big accounts get thousands of interactions for doing the bare minimum. we spend time and effort on our tweets and we deserve better<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>treasure island and ac store accounts need to learn to distance themselves from their account like be professional on your work account.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>wait so you are telling me that all entps have god complexes and it’s not just me? lovely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SolRecall one day i am going to snap and then you will never hear from me again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I remember I was in 2nd grade and I dressed up as a fucking storm trooper to school for halloween and I took off my helmet and everyone was so shook I was a girl LMAOOOOO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>my whole world revolves around anime, i started cosplaying when i was 11 but even earlier bc I use to have naruto headband and throwing stars when i was in 3rd grade<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i still can’t wrap my head around the concept of people just finding out about anime now after they are already in college, your life had to be boring as fuck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>the audacity of redd to come to my island once a month just to let me buy only ONE painting or statue that could be fake...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if you feel burned out of the game, it’s probably time to pick up something new.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>this community has a history of harassing nintendo over things they just don’t like or they want different.  I understand you might envision the game differently but just let the creators do what they feel best for the game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>sit down and let me tell you alittle something...  stop harassing nintendo because you didn’t get a feature or update, the game came out right when a pandemic hit and it’s obvious things will be pushed back and slowly will come out as time passes.  https://t.co/ir1KVeOtUe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Laura_Louuise he got exposed for being a pedo, asking underage fans for inappropriate pictures. he admitted to it then supposedly went to therapy for a month then ran back to ireland and is pretending like nothing has happened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brookiecrossing I had to skip this semester too because they wanted 800$ straight up and I didn’t feel comfortable taking out a loan for it. always next semester, always next year. trust me their is no rush you will get through it eventually<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rosepoof the game literally dropped the same week everything started to close and mask were starting to be required so yea that too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rosepoof honestly, the fandom was chill asf and  the only person we all disliked was bricyln forest, but i was a smaller account at the time so maybe i didn’t see everything going on idk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rosepoof i was here before nh was released and we literally never had drama until the game dropped 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>what if we went to a treasure island together haha 😆<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@maebcrossing OMG NOOOOOOO IM CRYING FOR YOU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i been checking my twitter only a couple times of day but not staying on here for long intervals and if i see something i don’t like i just switch to a different app or find something else to do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I started spending more time on actually playing animal crossing then being on ac twitter and honestly i’m enjoying the game more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ARENDELLEAC AHHH OMG<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I don’t know who needs to hear this but it is okay to cut off toxic family members.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>my biggest escape growing up was watching video game let’s plays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i’m cool with people getting into video games and anime but you have to realize a lot of ya were bullied and laughed at for wearing cosplay or being into anime.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thirstyteddybe1 @yoongiswhale @sapphic_angelic since the 50s, he/him lesbians have been around since then look it up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>report these accounts immediately and block them if you ever come across them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>tw // death threats and doxxing   guys please be very careful on here, their is accounts being made just to troll and that are actively doxxing, hacking accounts, and sending death threats to people. some are pretending to be rp accounts please be wary of ur mutuals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>got some new mini figures 👉🏻👈🏻  https://t.co/sYIfECMLtZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pchprk i never played but i’ll try it out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>yes i decided i’m going to focus more on other games then animal crossing because animal crossing twitter seems to figure out a way to get worse day after day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beecrossing_ @crossingdann @sunbeachisle @ashemonxx @jennamations @lukasspukass @kkunoriginal @SGaazer @mochitide @AhgaseACNH @KOROKCROSSlNG ?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I think that’s enough twitter for me today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WorldYea HEUEVEUEEBSV ONG THIS IS LIKE A WATTPAD STORY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@azu_ruma people now a days omg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>did someone really just blame harry styles for why they were saying the n word i-<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ice_witch_13 thank you 🥺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@koffeekenma thank you 🥺<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Quiqueh6 pogggerss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PastelKristina_ omg i deadass forgot about his existence dhhdhhdbs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PastelKristina_ awwee it’s all good 👉🏻👈🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IceyAnthonyy so excited :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I GOT MY FIRST TWITCH SUB TODAY ❤️❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>he was speaking some facts ngl  https://t.co/5Ej5LuFTkf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>monokuma was speaking facts when he said “why rely on the police they are just bad guys kicking other bad guys to look cool” and I live by that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if you want a follow back just ask it’s hard for me to keep up with my followers list so it’s easier for me to follow back if u ask or just interact with me 👉🏻👈🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gf_shiverpass good :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>it feels like everyone is leaving animal crossing twitter, its understandable honestly since the community has grown we have been dealing with a lot of ignorant people and it can cause a ton of stress.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gf_shiverpass same here!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamhurtin about to sleep hbu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VanilleLucia 🥺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ITS ONLY BEEN A DAY AND 17 PEOPLE DEACTIVATED WHY IS EVERYONE LEAVING  https://t.co/4iHoXvt2zd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i’m honestly starting to think everyone has me muted because no one has been interacting with me 🙃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the sound of thunder is so relaxing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just don’t think we should say things like “you aren’t ___ enough” because it invalidates the person who is apart of that community.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>when i say lucky to have lighter skin i meant like i’m lucky i don’t get profiled as much or have to deal with the racism that’s implied with it. you should be very proud of ur skin color. if that came off wrong im sorry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i’m very lucky to be able to have the privilege to go to college and be the first one in my family to make a step forward, i know i’m lucky because my skin is lighter, i know that i’m privileged but i’m still fighting for our community the same as you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>lowkey it makes me so upset when people tell me i’m not hispanic enough like i know i’m a very privileged individual in our community but i’m still part of it...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the fact that i most likely will have to get hand surgery and i won’t be able to play video games until it’s healed makes me sad 😞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>omg i thought i was just weird hdjdhdjdbx  https://t.co/C5Tk2VGWU0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>stream tonight?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@animalcrossiant sally’s!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@animalcrossiant do it without letting them know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blondiee180 omg on 4th od july everyone was shooting fireworks and i had to hide in my basement bc it was so loud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blondiee180 me too especially fireworks they hurt my ears really bad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jackieacnh @SGaazer bunniee:)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>do your job @Twitter what’s the point of blocking people if they can still see my replies and shit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>twitter new update now shows the replies of someone under a tweet even if they have you blocked 👀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I go by she/her pronouns but if you ever use they/them it doesn’t bother me either :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@l4ruh cheese<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vanilalewd do u know what anime she is from<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WorldYea people do that???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>educate yourself if you disagree 👋🏼  https://t.co/nvizhktHwW<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>SHOULD I STREAM ALL THE DANGANRONPA GAMES??? I PLAN TO PLAY THEM ANYWAYS SO UR CHOICE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@snitchery ma pls play animal crossing with me i beg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maebcrossing if you do, obv don’t try to make yourself darker like how people cosplay the girl from mha who is a bunny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maebcrossing it depends tbh but i think their is enough lighter skin tone characters to the point where you don’t need to cosplay as a poc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>it’s pretty obvious it’s okay to use face paint if you want to be purple or another color but you should know when it draws a line.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just want to say, since cosplaying is now becoming a “cool kids trend” please choose a cosplay character who matches ur skin color or a weird color (blue) but don’t do black face, don’t tan ur body to try to become a character shade. there is so many characters to choose from.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grendelsgf thank you same to you ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i’m going to be taking a short break from twitter, I will every now and then possibly post links for my twitch streams but other than that i won’t really be on the tl or looking at my replies. i’m going to rt older tweets i posted that i think you guys will like! byee 🥺❤️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@xamycrossing they started attacking someone for using tw on a tweet 🙃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i’m honestly starting to believe animal crossing 30+ twitter is on a whole different wavelength<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>let’s normalize trigger warnings please<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@road2lvl100 please use trigger warnings thanks<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wifeofbella same to you, thank you for listening to me and holding me accountable for my past actions. glad we could have a civil conversation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wifeofbella shit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TWW// anti sentimism   HE MADE ANTI SEMTIC JOKES NOT DEATH THREATS I DONT KNOW WHY I SAID DEATH THREATS BUT REGARD THAT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>tw // death threats  jess is also not responsible for anything her followers have done to me or my friends including death threats or doxxing as she can’t control that. we are both trying to figure out who this person is as it effected us both.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>tw // anti semitism and rape   I was mistaken by the fact that I thought jess was friends with omar who accused a minor of rape and made death threats. the person who told me that didn’t want to come forward/have ss. Jess was not friends with omar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have spoken to @wifeofbella and we have chosen to both delete our threads and move forward from the situation before we do this I just want to add another two tweets clearing something up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acnhmateja it’s okay just not really my thing tbh<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jouchprincess i’m pretty cute, i don’t encourage bringing others down by their looks but i think you are cute too have a good day :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>as jess said that she wants to figure this out privately I will not be commenting on the situation any further until I hear her out and try to figure out a solution. I encourage you to read both threads and understand where both parties are coming from. love you all ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@animalcrossith i wasn’t paying attention to any of that i’ll will unfollow them right now thank you for informing me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jouchprincess um ok<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ACNH_Kizzy people are going to pick sides it’s pretty inevitable, but i don’t care if people follow her or not. i just wanted her to take accountability for her actions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@btschub i’m not saying snitch but 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AthensIsland no i was never like in middle school by any guys from what i knew<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@honeynef lmaoo thank you 😂😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@s0lstin ty i also reported them, they made an account before harassing my gc but that one got locked. i hope their account gets suspended and whoever ip is linked to it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@s0lstin @/acnhjudy1isback<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if you have a problem, take it up with me not any of my friends because most of them are minors and this shit isn’t okay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>personally I don’t want any minors involved to be receiving any of this stuff as it was hard for them to even come forward to start with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>tw // doxxing and death threats  people are really doxxing me and minors included in my thread and sending death threats over this shit.... i hate animal crossing twitter.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wifeofbella let’s talk then<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I shouldn’t have added something to the thread that I didn’t have full context of but everything else was fully fact checked, again I am sorry to that person for my mistake and i’m thankful they held me accountable for my actions as I did mess up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want to make a public apology to @paradisebstsong as I added a ss to my thread with her name and I didn’t cover her name or have the full context. I’m really sorry and I should have spoken to you first on the manner. She is a good person and was fighting for her beliefs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paradisebstsong i just woke im still reading thru all my dms and comments, that one was sent to me so i explained it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crossingcreedy that shit would always make me scared hdjddbd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Disneylovemail you shouldn’t apologize for not being active, you have a life outside of twitter and everyone should respect that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Disneylovemail it’s okay don’t apologize:3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AwesomeMonkey97 ur parents shouldn’t be treating you that way, take some time if you need to just be alone.  i’m really sorry :(<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CeceCurlz don’t pay it full off, just make sure ur under 30% and is constantly paying it on time and you will be just fine. if you don’t have anything to pay off it won’t help with ur credit :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@honeynef ur welcome bb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CeceCurlz it’s really important bc young people always are like yess credit card let me buy a bunch of useless stuff then never pay then wonder why years later why they are deep in debt and can’t qualify for a house :/<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@yeagerzoes yesss and then most recent was brolly from the dragon ball z movie  https://t.co/1QhL3aZN1U<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yeagerzoes he had over 300 roles and most of them where playing high school students hdhdhdhd i’m glad he is gone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yeagerzoes i think he went to my local con that year too to some other time, I only liked his role as tamoki from ohshc but he wasn’t meant to be annoying. I’d say give it a chance and if you like it then watch it but if you don’t drop it. I personally don’t see the hype<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yeagerzoes I always found his voice insanely annoying, I watched the dub in like 2014 I doubt I will ever rewatch it again it felt like a huge waste of time the first run :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yeagerzoes I honestly could not get into fma like I watched both the original and brotherhood (to see the hype)but i was bored watching it idk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pansyleaf @P1XIEWRLD send you thoughts and prayers, if you need anything shoot me a dm and i’ll try my best to help<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DestanieACNH probably for the better tbh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lucyplaysacnh atleast try to stay away from the tl, the tl is usually the most toxic thing i just try to stay in dms and sometimes in noti<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarmaCrossing oooo okay 👉🏻👈🏻 continue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarmaCrossing i think it’s because a lot of people are deactivating, it seems like everyone is losing followers rn don’t take it personal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@caitieofabalone too meee ur not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@caitieofabalone you are never annoying 😐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@caitieofabalone i’m always hear to listen you can vent me privately if that would make you feel better 🥺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@caitieofabalone sometimes it happens to me and i’m a bigger account, the algorithm can be terrible especially if you aren’t changing to “lastest tweet” and only have “top tweets” on it makes it hard for anyone to see ur tweets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@caitieofabalone nooo don’t be embarrassed it’s okay if a post doesn’t do well, maybe no one saw it or it just got swept on the tl because so much is going on 🥺 keep trying don’t give up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@caitieofabalone the tweet is deleted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@caitieofabalone ooo i can’t see bc i think they have me blocked :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@caitieofabalone what’s wrong bb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexxSeven honestly, i just don’t remember it being this bad in the fandom to the point it is at rn :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rosepoof wait that’s so adorable omg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just realized how many people have been deactivating :( i’m so sorry this fandom is slowly no longer to be a safe space but pls come back when you are all ready 🥺<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@strawberbri i know we aren’t close but i like you 🥺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>as animal crossing community gets bigger more toxic and problematic people will join but we just need to learn to faze them out and try to stick to being positive as hard as it can be sometimes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@citrusspam onlyfans is going thru tax evasion and locking people’s account probably not the best idea rn try patron<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenIsABot_ read my last two weets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>tw/ suicide  the fact that people in this community are making tweets encouraging suicide because they are upset or triggered over something aint it, I hope you are speaking to ur friends privately about the situation and tell them that it’s fucked up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>y’all really out here making/liking tweets telling people to die just because they did something you don’t like....I’m speechless<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>not sure how correct this is but supposedly o*lyfans is in court for tax evasion and they are locking people accounts so it’s best to take out whatever money you earned from them rn<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@P1XIEWRLD this what it looks like for iphone users  https://t.co/IUfBE4RSFp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AthensIsland it’s pretty simple so 9x1= 9 so when you put a finger down you get nine and it goes from here so 4x9 you put down the forth finger, the three infront of it make that 3 so you add a 0 to make that 30 and the fingers after the four make 6 so the answer is 36<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@m00nisle pitfall seed but i won’t be home for like 6 more hours😔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AthensIsland that’s how i do my 9s is on my fingers like the teacher deadass taught us to use are hands to help<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@snailcrossingac who said that? i’ll fight them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LunarIslands gotta keep people safe 👉🏻👈🏻 i always carry safety defenses just in case and not everyone can afford a gun or a pocket knife so just having pepper spray can make people feel at easy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>most pepper spray go for like 10$<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>it’s becoming an everyday thing where animal crossing treasure island accounts are getting exposed and this is why I buy off ebay 😐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZeeeJeee if you play video games that means you most likely have good bodily kinesthetic because it helps you catch bugs in animal crossing twitter or tap fast when you need to tap<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@acnh_islndr ofc, my dad taught me this before driving bc he gets racially profiled a lot. so whenever we did get pullover I always made my hands visible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@birussou if i could dip, I would.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>newer drivers probably don’t know this so I just want to make it clear, speak to them like you are speaking to a teacher because if they feel like you are not showing them respect they will get insanely aggressive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t know who needs to hear this but if a cop ever pulls you over, put ur phone in the cup holder on record and put your hand on the steering wheel do not move unless you are told and when you do move make it transparent of what you are doing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>best thing to do for you and your mental health is to log off twitter or to block those people and not respond<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>reading negative tweets and arguing with people on twitter will raise your cortisol levels which can cause you to feel more stressed out and affect your mental health.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I honestly forgot that they changed money trees into egg trees during the easter update, that was the worst shdhdbdb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LunarIslands I’ve seen so many arguments today that could have easily just stayed in dms :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>we should normalize educating people and having conversations in private rather than attack someone before giving them a chance to even explain themselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the biggest problem is people aren’t willing to settle things privately so it ends up causing a whole war on the tl and people feel forced to feel a certain way when they aren’t involved or know what’s going on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>honestly, when it comes to drama on here I just think most of the time is miscommunication issues and they could be fixed if people took their problems privately.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wifiboybands you can always play with me!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@latenadia small mexico<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>animal crossing is really just high school all over again except the fact that it’s virtual and no one learns shit  https://t.co/ZZj7xcf9ts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mayacrxo honestly people just hateonthings they aren’t educated on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if i don’t follow back like this tweet so i can follow back :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pxxchyel LMAOOOOOOOO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>play animal crossing the way you want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if you have a kidcore island, continue doing what you are doing. if that’s ur aesthetic then go for it. don’t let anyone try to lower you or make you feel uncomfortable. block anyone who gives u trouble and enjoy animal crossing the way you please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>which she has confirmed to doing ^ so rather than people saying awe that’s cute instead they try to turn it into something it isn’t. kidcore is not meant to be sexualized, it is not meant to cause issues, it is meant for people to enjoy their islands and be able to relieve stress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>tw: sexualize and pedo  people are sexualizing kidcore, lolita, anything child like because people are trying to make it more sexualize like belle delphine for example she uses her childlike built, braces, and kid like behavior to market off of pedos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i’m sure there are more reasons people enjoy kidcore. the problem is people aren’t understanding this and making it into something that it is not. it shouldn’t be sexualized because it’s not meant to be. but why do people sexualize it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another reason people have kidcore islands is because the sense of nostalgia of being a child, liking pastal things, teddy bears, childhood games, this can cause them to feel relief and able to relieve a childhood they enjoyed or create the ideal childhood.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TW/ trauma  Many people react differently to their trauma, one reaction is called regression. Regression is a coping mechanism in which one goes into a younger version of themselves. people who have this can make their island reflect that state of mind so they feel safer in game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is similar to a style called lolita which is very childlike and have a child feel to them. The problem with both is that people tend to sexualize it without understand why it’s created/being used. so let’s talk about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is Kidcore? Kidcore is a style of island made to look child like compared to cottagecore or other styles of island. these type of islands tend to be pastal, have nostalgic sense and all around be more child like. here is an example  https://t.co/wxqiOUYkB7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RottenmilkAC i’m starting shhh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>let’s talk about kidcore: a thread ✨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AceSpadesArt one of my favs too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>choose<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>at my funeral, I want a one hour reading of my best tweets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gf_shiverpass exactly, it’s kind of like cosplayers like some are cringy but most of them are some of the nicest people you will meet. I personally never had a bad experience with a cosplayer or furry irl at cons but everyone different<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mayacrxo this video helped me learn more about the furry culture  https://t.co/21008N7Hnq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mayacrxo (c) go into a child mind state or other disassociatethemselves from their trauma, what the furry community does it create their own idea self as a animal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mayacrxo every community has a portion that’s problematic and like that, not all furries are like that tho. a lot of furries are actually minors, and it’s more of the story of their own characters and creating their own persona to mask their current one, like some people regress and (c)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heathergraysonn omg the red looks so good on you!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRedComet__ pc or ps<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wifiboybands i doooo :3 i’m pretty sure i’m like level 60 something<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kkmeIba just want the cupcake trees back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anzucrossing i’m glad try to keep it up i believe in you 🥺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@renntendo for example killua like he is a 13/14 year old boy and all these girls on tiktok are obsessed with him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I try to keep my tweets as sfw as possible bc I know I have followers as young as 13 who are looking at my account and I don’t want to make them feel uncomfortable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dylan_bobrosx so much for talking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if you are going to post anything nsfw, please commit to be an 18+ account and be full in because if you have even a couple minors following you, they will see that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SupremeHokage3 like a year ago, he deactivated them came back like nothing happened and everyone suddenly forgot until he got caught this time and people actually held him accountable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SupremeHokage3 yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SupremeHokage3 he got called out for the same stuff in the past so this is the second time and he almost made a girl d word by bullying her and making his fans gang up on her. he should’ve deactivated and never came back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SupremeHokage3 no❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ultrafloral i-<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pierrotouji i didnt even think about it like that thank yu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pierrotouji i’ve always wondered why people gender god as a man and invision them as one, bc god is explained as energy and not a human form. i think a lot of people mix up god and jesus alot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sapphicolive i’m not a big fan of the nsfw either but i think that person clearly don’t know what their talking about. furries come in all ages and most of the stuff is sfw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>have you seen a fur suit? those shits are dope and I know the people who make them out hundreds of hours into their craft. and like they have to be in those hot ass suits for HOURS at conventions, big respect to them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>how are you part of the animal crossing community and hate furries? you are half way there<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I wasn’t completely sure the person said that to trigger me, They were saying before they were a fan of my twitter and asked if i went by the name dusty/desty so I just tried to respond as calmly as possibly and not let it get to me but please don’t do this again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@natsukashi_isle it’s okay 😓 i’ll just make sure to have my boys ready to block that word as i forgot and didn’t think anyone would do that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i’m new to twitch this being my second week of streaming, I will not allow you guys to try to bully me off twitter or twitch. if you don’t like me, ignore my existence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>please don’t come to my stream to call me dusty it is very rude since I mentioned multiple times that’s a trigger of mine and i will automatic ban you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lucyplaysacnh i never really seen it on my tl until recently and it’s getting worse, i try to block people who are like that but it’s like waves are coming in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>this community is starting to become just a group of high school bullies can y’all like stop that behavior?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acnhrach AHH HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The phrase “it’s just a game” is such a weak mindset. You are ok with what happened, losing, imperfection of a craft. When you stop getting angry after losing, you’ve lost twice.   There’s always something to learn, and always room for improvement, never settle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@snitchery omg I was at a concert like three years and a guy was behind me with a boner pressing against my ass (I was in the front at the barricades) and i was trying so hard to push him off of me 😓<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>looking for someone who does town flags for nmt or in game materials:3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RottenmilkAC @KenmieLovesYou @caitieofabalone @polarisvlogs i didn’t mean to it was an accident 👉🏻👈🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish realized you don’t have the shake the trees to get the items, they will eventually fall out themselves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Naomi_am_Hogan probably best idea<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@solyluna_acnh definitely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiseTitus i use to play daily too idk why I stopped I had a whole server<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need to get back into minecraft, it was a fun game and I really enjoyed how relaxing it could be just building<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mayacrxo oof 😓<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t ever want to make y’all uncomfortable or feel forced into doing something, if I do something you don’t like shoot me a dm and i’ll try to fix it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i mentioned this before but if I ever call you bb and it makes you uncomfortable let me know bc I call everyone it and I don’t want to make you feel that way :(<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>am I the only one who rereads over all my tweets 100 times<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>we just here for the dank memes and chill vibes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>saying “hey you follow this person that I noticed did this please look it over and choose to do what’s best in ur opinion” is okay because you aren’t trying to force people to feel a certain way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I honestly think tweets that are like “unfollow this person I don’t like or I will block you” is really distasteful and kind of show that you want to force people into your idea on that person rather than allowing them to create this own opinion.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>personally i don’t have any ill feelings towards anyone on this app, i just don’t care enough. I just block and move forward.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@babyusagimoon @cinderisle bc she posted about MY PERSONAL information without my consent lol ok bye<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cinderisle @babyusagimoon the only tweet i seen on the account was about me so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@babyusagimoon i’m being the asshole? she made an alt account to talk shit about me after telling her followers that i’m the reason she’s deactivating, that’s an asshole /manipulative move<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luckyluckyollie @clotteris @MaplesStoryACNH then what is this  https://t.co/KmUDn8bIXm<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>i honestly feel sick to my stomach<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luckyluckyollie @clotteris @MaplesStoryACNH obviously as i mentioned before she would be the last person I would ever talk to about my own personal issues but she came onto the tl blaming me for what someone else did<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luckyluckyollie @clotteris @MaplesStoryACNH never fucking asked her to? she did it without my knowledge and i didn’t know until it was too late to say something<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaplesStoryACNH @clotteris after she already fucking dmed you??? not before BECAUSE I NEVER ASKED HER TO DO THAT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clotteris @MaplesStoryACNH she was the one posting it on the tl and making it public so technically it is her fault<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaplesStoryACNH WHEN DID I SEND MY FOLLOWERS? I NEVER DID, YOU ARE TRYING TO IMPLY ITS MY FAULT THEY WANTED TO DM YOU PRIVATELY WITHOUT EVEN ASKING ME FIRST THATS NOT MY FAULT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaplesStoryACNH GIRL YOU ARE THE ONE TWEETING IT ALL OVER THE TL AND TALKING ABOUT IT??? YOU NEVER GOT MY PERMISSION TO EVEN SPEAK ON WHAT IM GOING THROUGH THE MAIN TWEETS WAS ABOUT ME/MY FAMILY, YOU DONT THINK IM TRIGGERED BY THIS WHOLE THING? LEAVE ME ALONE<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MaplesStoryACNH are you fucking kidding me? is this a fucking joke to you? i never asked anyone to send a fucking dm to anyone all you do is assume and speak on shit you clearly don’t know about holy fuck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrappeFizzy have you added stuff to it?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_Gypsum_ @luckyluckyollie @MaplesStoryACNH @KathlnTheHat i think you misread my tweet, my tweet was towards maple. maple shouldn’t have posted that dm bc she didn’t have my permission to even speak on the subject.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@calliecrossing that’s good tho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the way my brain is running off of two hours of sleep but hey it’s friday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ACTeapot it’s banned???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Simba2691 yes monarch is fine too :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>as you can tell, no where on my account even says desty on it so I don’t know why people are even referring to me as that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewHorizons___ my best friend and my dad is a sagittarius, I appreciate them and how much they talk 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Personally, I do not go by desty anymore because people would call me dusty as a bullying tactic. It makes me feel uncomfortable as I have mentioned this multiple times I even had a pinned for awhile, I go by classic so call me classic unless you know me personally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@khaleeesia omg ur icon is so cute 🥺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RosieACNH_ damn we have it hard out here bc cancer rules the moon so we feel our emotions the deepest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RosieACNH_ what’s ur moon?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SolRecall basically some girl wanted to cancel me over someone else saying a slur when i had nothing to do with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>my dms are open if anyone wants to talk about the situation, i’m always here to talk and listen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@familypetMars @MaplesStoryACNH @pixiemoe3 @AJungkookBias @acnhleiv ???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mudkip_fuck also bla bla<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AC_Marie_ o idk it shows ur full amount when i look at it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AC_Marie_ after 10k yea<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Naomi_am_Hogan I know that but I know some people do it just to bother me rather than actually make a mistake. love you too 🥺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i’m definitely bla bla<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i haven’t been able to stream lately bc my internets been out plus something other personal life events  but i’ll be back soon i miss it so much❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>anyways what thread should i do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t know why people are lying on me saying I agreed when that wasn’t the case, also I go by the name classic it is very offensive to me when people call me anything other than that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I spoke to moe about what she said and explained to her why she shouldn’t be saying those things, again her tweets are out of my control but I did speak up and talked to her privately about it. I never defended/agreed with her actions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaplesStoryACNH well you contined to tweet about the situation rather then speaking to her privately leading it to that and she had to go private bc she was scared for her life. which you never apologized to her for allowing ur followers to do that to her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaplesStoryACNH ohhh so you are okay with allowing people to send them death threats and doxx them bc it was a small inconvenience for you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaplesStoryACNH after she apologized countless of time you kept tweeting about the situation which caused her to get doxxed and sent death threats like this  https://t.co/JVgDBW8RlA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaplesStoryACNH this you?  https://t.co/ZmazDb1LFT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaplesStoryACNH also didn’t you make a shit ton of tweets bullying my friend bc she was confused about something and allowing people to send death threats and dox her bc you wouldn’t accept her apology? you put my friends endanger, why would i apologize to you over a tweet LMAOOO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaplesStoryACNH you were still friends with them and allowed their behavior<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaplesStoryACNH actually it was ur friends bc it was the goons gang that you constantly interacted with so nice try lying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaplesStoryACNH oh your friends that were in a groupchat making fun of my eating disorder and continued to harass me after telling them to leave me alone multiple times? no❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaplesStoryACNH where did i say that i agree with her or i defended her. i said i spoke to her in private about the situation as you would too if you were friends with someone. i can have private conversation that aren’t on the tl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaplesStoryACNH i never defended her? where did i defend her?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>calling me desty/dusty is invalidating me, y’all are sick 🤮<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaplesStoryACNH aweee calling me desty/ dusty knowing that i don’t go by that name anymore, first off call me classic. second off ur “friends” were harassing me and i told them multiple times to leave me alone which they refused.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acnhleiv you know ur friend is still calling me stupid right ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acnhleiv ah your making fun of my spelling, you really showed me!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acnhleiv didn’t your friend openly call me dumb then compare me to a kodik bar... how do you know if i have a learning disability? if you want to make it about me calling out my friend, call out your friend first 😌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i didn’t realize we had karen’s in animal crossing twitter until today  https://t.co/pIionHiwN8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acnhleiv @SimliciousSarah ahhh so i have to speak out publicly about something i didnt do when i can speak to her privately about the situation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acnhleiv @SimliciousSarah ah so if she’s in my bio that means i agree with every word she says?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acnhleiv @SimliciousSarah where did i say i stand with what she said? make assumptions hmm...how do you know if i’m talking to her privately about the situation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acnhleiv @SimliciousSarah ah so i didn’t say it, then don’t make up lies saying i did ✨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimliciousSarah why did you go quiet all off a sudden, where did i say a slur? i’m waiting sarah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acnhleiv how do you know if it’s paying someone rent money or not? are you the one selling in game items?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimliciousSarah @acnhleiv where did i say a slur?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acnhleiv then cry to yourself not to me or the others who are making a living off of it 👋🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimliciousSarah @SpinaSoul you are spending a lot of time replying to this messages sarah, shouldn’t you be going to ur job?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimliciousSarah  https://t.co/B9HYFLQ5Sh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimliciousSarah @pixiemoe3 what you going to do? cry about it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chawbiecrossing pisces men are evil<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RosieACNH_ exactly like nmt are more useful then leaf tickets will ever be and it’s cheaper too 100 leaf tickets is like 4$ while 400 nmt is 4$<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pixiemoe3 @SimliciousSarah LMAOOOO MOE SHDHDBDH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>anyways if you sell any in game items shoot me a dm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>y’all are okay with feeding the corporations but not ur own community, i see how it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>so y’all perfectly fine with paying for leaf tickets on pocket camp but upset that people are buying nmt for new horizons???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@citrusspam people are honestly just so oblivious to the world they live in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pixiemoe3 she’s out here telling people to get a job when she needs to focus on herself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pixiemoe3 sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@herewithnessa i literally work full time and i got other shit to do where i miss events and stuff so it’s easier to just pay to get the diys i missed then time travel backwards and spend house looking for them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i’m tired of people acting like the damn animal crossing police, this the reason why star trees were removed and why we can’t have nice things in this community.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stars_near_mars really? my mom and brother are opposite, they are more feeling based but won’t express their feelings while i’m more of a logical type. like they both are infj while i’m an entp meaning they are feelers while i’m a thinker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@onIypietrostan deadass it’s really not their business if people buy from it or not and like i would rather pay 4$ for the whole set of cherry blossom diy then spend hours trying to get every diy for it, it’s more convenient for the buyer and helps the seller.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_adriennelee they are boring to me :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i’m a cancer moon and pisces rising if that gives more context lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HakiPuck all the virgo’s i’ve dealt with are snooty and think they are better than everyone. also they expect you to do everything thing hey say perfectly or get mad. not my cup of tea<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stars_near_mars my mom and brother is an aquarius and they are just too out of touch for me like y’all really have no emotions at all or atleast don’t know how to express them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sweetpcrossing i hate them, they ruined my life ✨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>libra men and libra women are wayyy too different, i had to separate them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>my opinion on the zodiac (taurus sun)  aries ★★★★ taurus ★★★★★ gemini ★★ cancer ★★★★★ leo ★★★ virgo ★ libra men libra women ★★★★ scorpio ★★★★ sagittarius ★★★★ capricorn ★★ aquarius ★ pisces ★★<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@m00nisle idk if her commission is open but @judkalei_art is a great artist 😌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WorldYea to them, its negative to call out people who do this so 😌✨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ibascrossing dry bones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>did you create the art? did you pay for the commission and got the consent of the artist to resell their artwork as merch? if the answer is no to both questions then don’t sell stolen artwork ✨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>do not come to my account to try to defend people stealing and selling art that they haven’t made themselves, your reasons are invalid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AceSpadesArt i have the original dvd when it first came out but i also watch it a lot too i know it like word by word almost lmaooo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@m00nisle she is lovely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i can say a reference and people will actually catch it 😌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i’m kind of glad people are realizing how amazing the scott pilgrim vs the world movie is and all the iconic quotes from it 🥺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WE LOVE TO SEE IT 🗣🗣🗣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@keywey03 omg i just woke up but i have to get a shot!! try to have fun at work<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crossingnips hii<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i just realized the tl deadass probably bc it’s 9am here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itslulubear don’t come into my mentions again byeee 👋🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>goodmorning to my babies 🥺✨how is everyone morning going?  https://t.co/qlmMeNRNkZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itslulubear this isn’t negativity, it’s deadass stolen work and you are supporting that bc it goes to “charity”, I was able to raise 300$ for the blm through animal crossing twitter without STEALING. it’s not excuse stop excusing him for stealing art and selling it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itslulubear they can, i don’t know find other way to raise money for that charity then sell stole assets???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itslulubear lol ok u do u, support copyrighted work bc it goes to a charity 👌🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itslulubear so calling out the fact that a big account is using their platform to sell copyrighted work when smaller artist clearly feel the hit because they spend hours to create art is negative? just say ur a fan of that parody account and go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itslulubear lol i always rt artist and buy from them, it’s my account I can bring attention to whatever I want?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itslulubear if they actually drew roald themselves rather than photoshopping a orange onto him and the mask is literally a picture of roald just zoomed up. it’s a complete different of stealing work and making your own. they aren’t making their own work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itslulubear actually, it does take away from real artist. people look at the account and see a big following maybe like some of the tweets so they want to support the creator, it would be different if they were rting small artist but nah they just stole copyright work and sold it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@galacticlunairy yess exactly and ive seen people who have drawn roald stickers who has been gotten barely any sales while the stock photo orange one gets sales<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itslulubear donating to charity is good and all but they are most likely taking away sales from real artist who need the money to survive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4 and my newest one of sayaka from madoka magica is my favorite  https://t.co/oiYkXjBCwH<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>at the end of the day, talk about things you are passionate about, tweet whatever you want and do it for your own benefit. if people fuck with you then they fuck with you and if they don’t then they don’t. stop taking twitter personally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>you know how many animal crossing accounts exist?? if one doesn’t want to be friends with you then move onto the next.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@galacrossing i have the regular one and the acnh edition 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WorldYea plus i spelled it wrong on purpose 🥴✨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>since my island was mass reported for this, I would’ve seen something from nintendo by now but I haven’t received anything since it isn’t breaking any rules 😌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>fencing off your island in the dream island isn’t violating any rules so do with that information as you will 🥴<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>the biggest lie in animal crossing was the white fences in the trailer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MobbDeepMela why didn’t he just cashapp her 5$ to get spotify 🤨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>verlisify when he realizes that nintendo is after him even though he thought he was doing a “good deed”  https://t.co/ZcJzRJyRAG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nebuleii_xoxo hehe 🥴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenLikesACNH basically they told some girl to get corona virus bc she was outside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>wouldn’t it be a shame if we all reported his discord and showed discord the ss of him taling bad about ptsd and him having it as a gift you pay for his patreon but he turned that feature off... so he is technically scamming his own fans  https://t.co/524cwGlS0G<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aestheticklutz @FrappeFizzy that’s the nintendo help number<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>if you are reporting to nintendo, his in game name is verlis and his island is called poketopia. do with that information as you will 😌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@misshemlock link<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>can we like stop using “ur mentally ill” as an insult...?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2N3RDY latino and hispanic are both ethnicity so yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2N3RDY idk if this make sense but ethnicity is different than race<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2N3RDY because hispanic is an ethnicity, you can be black and hispanic or be white and hispanic. you can be dominican and have european origins which makes you white.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@horizoncrossing WAIT THEY CAN USE SPARKLERS IM SCREAMING THATS SO CUTE<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Kitten_AC queen shit respect ✊🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kitten_AC at most nintendo will just remove it off the dream island and you can reupload it later. you should be okay. his fans might already be mass reporting so even if u remove it there isn’t much you can do :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>feel free to repost both and to contact patreon and gfuel directly ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JakeACNH__ @PatreonSupport yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crossingrosie ofc :3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hi @PatreonSupport It has come to my attention a youtube channel called “Verlisify” has a patreon. the owner of this channel has started harassing minors and making transphobic comments. they also have a discord connected to their patreon where they are bullying people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have emailed both so we will see what will happen 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kkfrobert wait that’s dope<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hi @GFuelEnergy It has come to my attention that you are sponsoring a youtube channel called “Verlisify” the owner of this channel has started harassing minors and making transphobic comments. It is also known that this youtuber has been racist and attacks other youtubers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>oh and patreon would love to know this person is on their platform too 😌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i’m not saying that if enough people tweeted at gfuel they would break their sponsorship with him but if you want we can idk tweet at them and let them know that they are sponsoring a transphobic who has targeted a couple minors 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fadedwxtch i don’t think imma even watch it, waste of time.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DizzyBunnies i’m not even part of the LGBTQ+ community, I just have it in my bio to help normalize pronouns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_clownkun 1/10<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@citrusspam second hand embarrassment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and with that tweet I am done with this topic. this guy is just an asshole. 🌸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if your dream gets reported than your dream will get removed, it won’t affect nintendo online or your island. so this grown man wasted atleast 20 minutes of his life going to dream islands to report them and asking his fans to report them to gain absolutely ✨ nothing ✨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>goodmorning hope you all have a wonderful day today  https://t.co/EtsAAPWuiN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yllecrossing exactly and nintendo isn’t looking into the islands they just see the mass reporting and take it off without checking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yllecrossing it’s already starting to happen :/ someone even got in trouble just for self promotion!!??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>also noticed if enough people report ur island then it will get kicked off the dream even if it’s not hacked. y’all ruin the whole point of the dream update.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>update: i haven’t seen anyone get banned on nintendo online for the star trees just seeing people not able to use the dream island anymore. y’all really did all that so others can’t visit the persons island in a dream 🤨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pinky_crossing @yllecrossing i’m really sorry :( i hope you can still enjoy ur island even after all this stuff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jackensei i’m sorry 🥺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@myavibroke where did i equate cheating to hacking? can you not read?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kawaiihotgirl you aint ready for it.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Senpai53571632 no clue<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@caitieofabalone i posted like 2 minutes of the video but i’ll be on twitch later reacting to this shit and watching the videos<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the reason people have their pronouns in their bio is for two reasons, they have a certain pronoun they go by or/and they are a supporter or part of the lgbtq+ community and realize that normalization of pronouns can help the community.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>since y’all are here, here is a thread continuing the support for black lives matter with petitions and education. take a moment out of ur day to sign if you have not.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NovaLu_ that’s a fan account ;/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ verlisfly you seem like the type of as*hole who would search up their own name, if you have a problem with the animal crossing community for getting star tree and other items you have to go through me first.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>guys, I understand your mad about liv idk her @ doing digital blackface as you have the right to be but some people are starting to send death threats and trying to dox @DatOneGuineaPig for spreading false information and she apologized for her mistake. my gc has spoken (c)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SlaterACNH i think i saw a post of people at nintendo y’all about it bc they don’t know if you hacked the trees in yourself or got them and it’s against nintendo rules to sell/buy in game items with real life cash that’s banable too even tho they don’t really hit on that hard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@solyluna_acnh be careful fr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toad_egg o no 😳 cut it down or close up shop<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if you have any hacked items, please remove them before opening up ur dream island because people can potentially report you and get you banned from nintendo online.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@strawberbri i don’t have much right now but i sent 20$ i hope it helps and you reach your goal ❤️ another stimulus check is hitting next month so hopefully you are blessed with that. stay strong!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>about to piss off the “family” who openly neglected me for years let’s go✨✨  https://t.co/zJbe8pLeAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>now i go log off bc that is giving me anxiety love you all bye bye 🥺❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PlutosHelmet thank you 🥺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>roni might be a good person I don’t know, but she definitely does things to please others and will manipulate you into her side. I hope she speaks up and actually apologizes for her actions and tries to change her behavior rather than just deactivate and run away from the problem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the point of this thread is that, roni only does what makes her look good and she will only apologize if it makes her look good. she has a large following so i never spoke up about the situation as I was afraid she will try to bully me into silence like she has before to others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>roni was dming her followers to unfollow and attack me. this is ironic because the people who were harassing me got called out for bullying their own friends and then she suddenly switched up saying that we should call out minors and that she doesn’t associate with them anymore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>her friends were harassing me and i told them multiple times to leave me alone and just to block me. and then she decides to make tweets like this. she deactivated so i can’t find all the ss but she made countless of tweets shading me.  https://t.co/MTD4pyIAAI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>some pointless drama happened and  her friends decided to target me, none of them dm me or spoke to me privately they just decided I was the target of the day. So roni ends up blocking me and making subtweets about me saying that adults should protect minors and all this bs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>me and roni were actually mutuals for awhile, I never interacted with her like that, sometimes Id reply to her tweets. I think I stood up for her before over something that happened but I can’t remember correctly so don’t quote me on that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am very nervouse to speak about this bc i don’t want to be harassed again but since everyone is speaking up i feel like i should also.   this is a thread about my interaction with roni aka islahorizons and her “friends”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>should i speak up or should i just mind my business 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@catriona_hannah awe ur stuff is adorable i’ll give you a rt, i’m really bad with plants so it not really my type of thing. thank you for sharing with me :$<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@windslicer4 it’s better to have 2 real friends then a thousand fake 😌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toad_egg exactly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>it is okay to call ur friends out when they do something wrong, if they refuse to change or fix the problem then they should have never been ur friend in the first place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>white people want to make their characters poc but can log off and not face the problematic system that is created against poc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>white people want to be a poc so bad but don’t want to face the struggles of being a poc. a dialogue.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>i just found this out like a few days ago off a tweet ( i couldn’t find the original tweet) so i just wanted to spread the info<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>this is for anyone with an aesthetic font as their name, I recommend changing it back to the normal font because people who use text to speech or who have dyslexia have a difficult time reading/understanding especially bc text to voice doesn’t pick up the font correctly.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@beaivicrossing exactly, stigma surrounding mental illness needs to be removed and we need to be able to talk about the symptoms and disorders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WorldYea kanye west is having a huge manic episode and his fans are egging him on and making a joke out of it when he clearly needs helps and kim tried to get him to go to a hospital<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yumekosdismay exactly! his fans aren’t taking it serious at all while his kim is doing her best to try to get him help. its so sad :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>tw// mental illness  everyone pretends to be mental health supporters but as soon as a someone shows clear signs of mental illness no one takes it seriously or laughs it off as a joke and that’s really heart breaking to me :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t think people understand that  kanye is going through a manic episode and people are just laughing at him and not trying to help him :(<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>what if they made it possible in new horizons to buy fortune cookies from nook cranny and their is atleast 100 possible items to get but every month or so they will switch out the special items n the only way you can get the item is thru the cookies??  https://t.co/BWIBpnmj1Q<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i would die to have this egg seat swing in new horizons  https://t.co/nt5H4Y7Kck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nookrep nah it’s normal to ship villagers together as long as it doesn’t get sexualized tbh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@s7nful yesss exactly how i feel!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexantium @byrunt it’s confirmed that he is actually a cancer so a water sign lmaooo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ilovefilbertsm i 100% agree, shipping them with other villagers is okay as long as they aren’t trying to make it weirdly sexual as some nsfw artist have done<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Xasannnni because the villager are like little kids in my eyes and people trying to romanticize them just seems really disturbing to me like you can think “judy and stitches would be cute” but instead it’s “me and judy would be cute” idk it doesn’t sit w me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>having a fake wedding with your favorite villager isn’t cute, it’s actually really weird and kind of disturbing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katieslider hi katie happy birthday!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nosocksclub wtffff i think i seen someone do that in new horizons but that’s so weird to me<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I just don’t see the point in people harassing yandere dev like yes you can be upset over the game not being finished or his bad past (i don’t really look into it so idk) but doxing him, sending him death threats, telling him to commit, is so disgusting to me?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>it’s becoming a huge problem and i’m sick of this person continuing to start drama for no reason. I want to be able to move on and not speak about this anymore. stop stalking me and move on thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>this is actual harrassment because it is unwanted and i have not spoken to this person nor said anything for the past three days. They also posted my private dms which spoke about my ed on the tl without my permission. I asked my followers to just ignore him but<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i’m tired of this bullshit, a minor is stalking my account and has been harassing me for the past three days after telling them to move on. They have started dming me and taking ss of my tweets twisting it to be about themselves. They even made one of my tweets their header.  https://t.co/0JK682F38N<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>CAPRICORN ♑️   finished their islands so early on and now go on to prefect it and talk to their villagers. they definitely have a goat or deer villager on their island.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>SCORPIO ♏️   played for the shortest amount of time then got overwhelmed over the options so they decided to play another game, only gets on when you force them to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LIBRA ♎️   is crying over the fact that their island isn’t even close to done and aren’t sure if they want to demolish it or continue on. most likely burnt out from overthinking about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>VIRGO ♍️   wants to make their island completely symmetrical and wants everything to be perfect before they allow anyone to come to their island.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LEO ♌️   claims that their island is the most beautiful thing they have ever seen and tend to post hundreds of pictures of each section they have created so others can admire them as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CANCER ♋️   will show up to your island to give you many gifts and bells then run away like they were never there but then message you to tell you that ur island is beautiful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>GEMINI ♊️   has no clue what theme they want to go with so they are constantly changing their island but yet never truly satisfied.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TAURUS ♉️   runs all around their island, stares at their island, realize they hate their island but is way too lazy to fix it then have their tenth burnout of the month.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ARIES ♈️   Aries are usually running after their friends with an net typing “i’m gonna get ya” then deciding that the net isn’t fun enough so they switch to the ax 😀<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>it is pretty much ingrained into my head that I have to protect myself because ain’t no one else going to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>people always ask “if your in trouble are you going to call the police for help??” bitch I grew up on 7 MILE, if you call the police they won’t arrive until a couple days later and then be like “oh well nothing we can do”<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@animalcrossiant @sunnyandbill lMAOOOO WHAT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kaitlynrose156 #i think i know who you are talking about, i watched her videos about the tiny tales<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s also good to have their own sand baths so they can clean themselves whenever they feel like they want to rather than forcing them week to week to do it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pikachu_268 oh yes of course I have had a few, they are adorable but very short life spans, just want to give them the best life possible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>jenna marbles made a perfect 14 minute video explaining how hamster houses should look and be like  https://t.co/nBWdHMoBbU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ARENDELLEAC definitely they don’t have a clue on what their doing and they just want the sale rather than educating the buyer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The best way to keep them out of the light is buying a little cover to put on their cage during the day then opening it up when you hear it awake and moving ☺️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pikachu_268 it’s not mine just a picture of reddit, i want one tho 👉🏻👈🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>adding chewing toys and a spinning wheel. make sure the spinning wheel is the perfect size for the hamster bc they can hurt themselves if it is too small for them. Also they enjoy hiding so tunnels are prefect. they are nocturnal so they enjoy not seeing light durning the day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The perfect home to buy them is a fish tank, preferably a 20 gallon tank. but the more you plan to buy the large the gallon you should get. remember to add a lot of filling because hamsters love to dig under it and play with it.  https://t.co/ErSZYBvN2q<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The tiny tale brands are very popular in pet stores usually right next to the hamsters so parents end up grabbing these believing these are okay. Drawf hamsters have a difficult time getting through the tunnels so imagine a regular size hamster? do not buy these ever.  https://t.co/72ItC3JadA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>let’s start with their homes, never put a hamster in these type of cages because the cages are wayyyy too small for the hamster, the hamster will have to squeeze to get through the tunnels and they will definitely break out of the cage bc it will stress them out.  https://t.co/YBaj5EnZJy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>a random thread on how to properly take care of hamsters because there is so many misconceptions and the pet store will lie to you ✨<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>since you are here please continue to fight for the blm movement, please continue signing petitions, donating, and doing your best to continue spread awareness. Breonna Taylor murder still have not been put into jail 🗣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I take mental health very serious so I try my best to speak up about those things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@egglietoast exactly that too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>adults are less likely to get help or even speak up about mental illness bc people tend to invalidate older peoples feelings by making statements like “you are too old to care about ___” or “you are an adult, who cares?”  when they speak up about their own issues/problems.  https://t.co/hKeH8sEBcP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>all the people who are saying “your 20 you shouldn’t care if they talk about your personal problems” this is invalidating my own feelings. This is a form of stigma in mental illness and I really hope those who said this understand that it is not okay to invalidate others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>also i never want to make my followers feel as if they need to unfollow or block someone for whatever mistakes they made, people grow and cancel culture is stupid. It is your own decision but there is always two sides of a story and sometimes it’s best to ignore situations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would never want my followers to feel as if they need to defend me because I can always defend myself. The truth has already been posted. Wasting your time arguing with him isn’t worth mine or your time. love you all ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>honestly last thing, don’t attack/even tweet at will, he clearly is young and doesn’t understand his own actions. the best thing to do is just ignore him. I know people want to defend me but it’s better to not get involved and just move on from the situation as i already have.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@strawberbri i’ll try to be more active ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>honestly love my life and the people who are in it 🥺<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nebuleii_xoxo marriage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OpalOfBallonlea i really hope she is safe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cathnuri really? it would make more sense tbh bc i doubt she would just leave her child on a boat by themselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>as someone who is going into law enforcement, The first two days are the most important and I feel like they didn’t do enough for her case. She can still be alive but the chances now have decreased bc of how they are handling this case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OpalOfBallonlea it’s scary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They need to be checking nearby areas, checking her phones and computer also her house to find any possible leads or information. Any cvt cameras in the area and asking more questions to people who could have been witnesses<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anyone else think it’s kind of sketchy that Naya Rivera hasn’t been found yet after three days and accordingly to the reports that they searched most of the lake, she could have gotten abducted or something else. They need to work harder on this case!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if she is a fan of bunnie, bea, or cookie then she’s the one 🥴<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>laugh all you want, talk shit all you want. But that’s my body and how i feel about myself and you have no right to speak on my body or the way i feel about myself. my gc is my safe place and that’s why I went to them about how I was feeling I didn’t think it would get to the tl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And i want my character to be seen as a different version of myself and all the thought in my head were getting to me so i wanted to cry to my bf about how i felt. I didn’t want that to be on the tl but since this person decided to post those ss. that’s the full story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TW/  also, I will speak for myself since it’s on the tl. I was dealing badly with my body dysmorphia and I felt really ugly one day having a terrible day and I went to my gc to talk about how i just don’t feel pretty enough and how my selfies don’t do as well as my character-<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>thank you for all my mutuals who have stood up for me, I really appreciate you guys. I honestly don’t think talking about people personal issue should have be discussed with anyone except the person.

<|startoftext|>I don’t know if I’ve spoken about this yet but I started working from 5-2am everyday and school is going to start soon so I won’t really be playing much or having time to post on here, i’m sorry I might become inactive but this is eventually going to help me be successful.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>bitches cry over copypasta but be the first to tweet “Hello! I have been following your tweets for the past two days, and have come to the conclusion that you do not deserve the have Raymond on your island. “<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ninja I have deleted the TIK TOK app off all my devices. Hopefully a less intrusive company (data farming) that isn’t owned by China  can recreate the concept legally, such funny and amazing content on the app from influencers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@honeynef wtfffff that’s wildddd be safe my guy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@animalcrashingg trueeee 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>this might be surprising and a new concept to some of you but have you ever thought about explaining and teaching a minor that what they did is wrong so they will learn in the future and never do it again ✨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>minors can say the most outrageous meaniest shit and someone in this fandom will be like “they are a minor we need to protect them ✨”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acexclusxve link it bb<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FrappeFizzy i use both, youtube are mostly auto generated so they can mess up a lot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>this is probably why i tend to be able to recite shows i’ve watched more than once, I know the entire script of shrek and most ouran high school host club episodes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chelseacnhh okay good omg i feel that and sometimes subtitles have extra captions in it like the background you wouldn’t notice if you just listened with sound<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@liopopp like sometimes i just read it instead of listening bc my mind gets too distracted on other sounds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>am I the only person who likes subtitles on even if i’m watching a show in my native language??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@octaviasalive 👁👄👁 it all makes sense now, I have watched shrek over like a thousand times and i still enjoy it everytime<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The phrase “it’s just a game” is such a weak mindset. You are ok with what happened, losing, imperfection of a craft. When you stop getting angry after losing, you’ve lost twice.   There’s always something to learn, and always room for improvement, never settle.<|endoftext|>
