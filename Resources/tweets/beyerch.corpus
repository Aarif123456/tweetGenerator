<|startoftext|>@JoshuaADouglas @travisakers Another pile of crap to rile up the base just like the binder full of "affadavits" and the binder full of blank health care plans........<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@travisakers At what point, do we arrest these people and charge them with sedition and/or treason?  This is *not* how the electoral process works and is yet another attempt to disrupt a valid election which is core to our democratic process.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnCleese I'm glad Trump is on his way out the door; however, no need to make stereotypes about people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@17_brook_17 Perhaps OL having consistency has something to do with it (Monty) as well?  I personally have *nothing* against Trubisky.  He seems like a great guy, but its been 3 seasons of poor passing and some questionable decision making.  Agree 100% he is more mobile and it helps, tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@17_brook_17 I'm not sure what you are smoking, but the biggest issue with Trubisky is that he can't pass consistently.  His numbers on passes &gt; 15 yards are horrible..  Foles didn't have tons of completions but that was more due to no time for play to develop due to OL issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@32Stats I love the ability to misinterpret stats by "stats" guys.  (e.g. using Foles vs. Trubiski as the predictor....)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DROYJohnson I agree because of O-Line, it makes Mitch look good, but he's not good.  But may be a better choice than Foles at this point.  Neither is our solution.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@junidaman Ummm no.  #1 - Look at the record of teams for Mitch's games and for Foles. #2 - You are forgetting that we had O-Line issues for multiple games due to injury and even COVID. #3 - "Mitch's" LOST games w/ more points.  (e.g. Detroit fumble to blow game)  Neither is solution<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@17_brook_17 If you think this team is good with either of them, you're an idiot.  GB (Loss) - "Garbage Time" points and special teams Lions (Loss) - Worse record than Bears, Trubiski cost Bears game w/ fumble. Texas (Win) - Worse record than Bears  Montgomery - Not due to Trubiski, lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flcnhvy @elonmusk @SpaceX @FutureJurvetson I know this launch was still a success, but this photo reminds me of ...   https://t.co/zZwWkIFFph<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"GOP election official tells legislators no 'credible evidence of large-scale voter fraud' during November election"  But sure, let's all go on the internetz and cry out for *ahem* "Marshall" Law because .......   https://t.co/J3qfoPjLP4  #MarshallLaw #TrumpVirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lew2Nai1 So if this were a Democrat president who "believed" he won, you'd have the same opinion?  Do you realize how utterly ridiculous this sounds?   Trump lost, get over it and move on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepBJNikkel @realDonaldTrump You guys are literally insane, there is no other way to explain this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tom2badcat This is by far the STUPIDEST thing I've read on Twitter and that is saying a lot.  Courts and most government officers operate on *FACTS*.  The *FACTS* are that Trump lost and no *CREDIBLE* evidence has been provided demonstrated fraud.  That is why 50+ courts turned them away<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillPascrell Sounds good to me.  They know they have no evidence and this is purely for their selfish interests.  They should be held accountable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MackMahoney @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump My math says there are &gt; 360M people in this country.  &gt; 80M of them voted for "non-Trump".  With that said, if I was presented with **evidence** of fraud, I'd take your side.  Can you show us your evidence?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nikatnite00 @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump She's just another nobody trying to cash in on the "voter fraud" attention-fest happening in "GOP Land".  I haven't figured out if 1st place prize is a:  1) Pardon, 2) Internet Followers, 3) "Inner Circle" job, 4) Any combination of 1-3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jimmyofflagstaf @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump Last I read, they had collected &gt; $200M.  The bulk of that money *DOES NOT* go towards "fighting fraud", just goes to their bank accounts.  Absolutely crazy that people haven't realized this yet.  If I didn't have morals, I'd turn Republican and start a fund as well.....  :shrug:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump Evidence, please?  Enough with the bullshit conspiracy crap.  This admin has now lost &gt;50 court cases due to lack of evidence.    I know it is apparently "trendy" to cry voter fraud in Republican circles, but enough already.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The Supreme Court did show great courage.  They stood up to 17 states, 100+ Republican Representatives, and the President to affirm the state's right to manage their elections.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA @GeoffDuncanGA @GaSecofState I'm a little confused.  If Democrats have rigged the GA election, why should Republics even bother voting?  If you really believed that is what happened, you wouldn't be telling people to vote, no?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Other than the "China virus" comments, this was a *GREAT* 3 minutes and 15 seconds.    If you only acted in this manner the other 3 years, 10 months, 21 days, 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 45 seconds you probably would have won re-election.  #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@politvidchannel Ouch, @SenTedCruz  .....  Does he (Trump/Russia) have something *that* incriminating on you or are you really just *that* desperate to move up the "political ladder"?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@covie_93 In case you haven't figured it out yet, this is all for show.  They knew this had no chance.  They are doing all of this so they can rile up "their base" to convince them of the "conspiracy" against them.  Then they will use this as justification to obstruct Biden's term.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan You forgot 17 states that allowed their attorney generals to join in on with this shit fest.  This country *SERIOUSLY* needs law reform including harsh penalties for frivolous lawsuits.   The past ~month has made a mockery of the courts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abbydphillip In a way, I somewhat wanted to see this get argued.  There's no way they expected this to get taken up by the court nor would they have been prepared.  It would have been rather entertaining to see them make asses of themselves again.  But I'm perfectly content with this outcome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drscott_atlanta The lack of knowledge on the internet astounds me....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanCrenshawTX Actually, I'm pretty sure you are doing this to cast doubt on the election.  U/GOP will then use this as a justification for obstructing Biden's presidency.  My "personal hope" is that elected officials do their jobs and  quit acting like spoiled children who didn't get their way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanCrenshawTX Firstly, states have the Constitutional right to manage their election processes.    Secondly, even if this had merit, why are 4 states being sued?  Dozens of states, including Texas, altered their process.  Shouldn't we throw them all out, not just ones Trump lost?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanCrenshawTX No, the Supreme Court does not "hear all cases", nor should they.  They hear cases which are within their scope and that have merit.  This "case" meets neither.    This is an irresponsible attempt to subvert the election and to provide "justification" to obstruct Biden's term.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donwinslow @Yahoo And now the real reason behind all of this bullshit:  Republicans want a "false outrage" to justify their planned obstruction to Biden's administration.   Thanks @SenTedCruz  for clarifying the situation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcorubio Are you really that unknowledgeable about our government or are you just being dishonest?  Hard to tell these days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Politics_PR On a side note, I think we now know positively who Russia has compromising information on....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bradheath This is absolutely ridiculous.  Per the Constitution, each state is responsible for their elections.  This has zero merit and the fact that so many people are joining to support this demonstrates how little these people understand the document &amp; country they claim to love...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JB39540608 @Politics_PR These states have performed any necessary recounts and have **certified** their state results.  **PER THE CONSTITUTION** each state manages their election process.   The opinion of 75M people or ~100 representatives are irrelevant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@raquelvasquez Far more importantly, the **CONSTITUTION** disagrees with those 106 House Republicans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GKeile This is utterly stupid. States, per the *constitution*, control their own voting process.  These states have certified their election results.  This lawsuit has zero merit and is quite *UN*American.  I understand not being happy with results, but this is getting ridiculous guys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Browns @CALLME_WOOD @bakermayfield Cool, but would really suck if he blew a knee out doing that....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@historygirl1020 Where do we sign up?  I'm done with the current sh*t we put up with.  Would be very interesting to see what happens when the bulk of economic production 'disappears' and the "leadership" can't blame the typical scape goats.  I guess they'll just create a new boogeyman....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmfa I actually agree and would love a split.  ~74M voters would realize real quickly that they were suckered into believing the "libs" were out to get them.  I wonder who they would blame next for their leadership's hate of working class workers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRickyDavila I'm sorry, but Colin Kaepernick did no such thing.  He was benched already for poor play and *THEN* he started protesting.  Since then he has cashed in with Nike.  If he was serious about fighting, where is he?  Other than asking people to donate for legal fees, nowhere ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PullxUpxLock @the_resistor @realDonaldTrump @jack @TwitterSupport Feel free to provide some *evidence* of that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Sure... why not, it's not like facts change your opinion or anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NKChapman @elonmusk Learning is a process of trial and error.... mostly error.  :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC @elonmusk - That's what happens to me in Lunar Lander&lt;tm&gt; when I come in too hot as well.  They'll get it right next time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNBC This is absolutely the most ridiculous thing I've read in quite some time.  As Texas also modified their voting rules for COVID, wouldn't this mean their delegates are eliminated as well?    There need to be serious consequences for this continued attack on the election process.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump On a side note, 1/3rd of GoFundMe pages are for medical expense donations.  Perhaps you could use your remaining time in office more productively?  There's also that COVID thing that is wrecking people's jobs / livelihoods.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Congratulations, you're the first one then!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustAManic2020 @AynRandPaulRyan @realDonaldTrump I'm disappointed.  His name was Baghdad Bob!  I think he was more truthful than McEnanny though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TonyFlo37023553 @Mrosie1031 @realDonaldTrump The Constitution also says that states manage their own elections yet Texas is suing 4 states over how *they* ran *their* election.  Somehow I don't think "The Constitution" matters to these people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrj614 @realDonaldTrump Their position changes to whatever suits their current needs.  Nothing more, nothing less.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LoriBragg16 @DuncanMcDowall @realDonaldTrump Feel free to point us to evidence of this.  Surely you have it available.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump "Our Country" *GOT* a victory when more than 80 million voters chose Joe Biden.  Feel free to publicly share all of the proof you have of fraud.  If it is credible, I'm right there with you.  As it currently stands there are over 40 "lost" court cases citing no evidence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Phyllis94584953 The country got a victory when ~83M voted Trump out of office.  This is an attempted *THEFT* by the out-going president.  There has been *NO* credible evidence provided.  Over *40* court cases have been filed &amp; lost where bipartisan judges have stated there is no evidence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllaboveClark lol, not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChicagoBears @MontgomerDavid I wish the ownership would keep on fightin' and clean out the Front Office.  Definitely some strong individual/group efforts on the field, but it just goes to waste in the end for numerous reasons that the currently 'leadership' cannot seem to figure out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah... wow @ChicagoBears .....  Time to clean house and start over.....  AGAIN......  #Chicago #beardown #Bears<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatrickMahomes @StateFarm Don't lie, they *DID* give you guys a special rate!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@picksixpod LOL, that's great.  Unfortunately, I'm a Bears fan.  We don't get quarterbacks that can pull off these sorts of tricks.  We're lucky to get completions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenMastriano Considering the election is certified, probably a good time to take a nap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedcruz While I think this is all a waste of time, I hope they grant this.  Would find nothing more entertaining than you embarrassing yourself on such a meritless case in front of SCOTUS.  Bonus points if its live on CSPAN.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisgarcia1063 @ethanmcarpenter More likely due to the fact that foreign nations have more access to space which put our satellites at risk.  It also allows us the ability to limit other countries capabilities and strike earthbound targets more efficiently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KEEMSTAR @realDonaldTrump @FBI @DHSgov @POTUS @CIA @DeptofDefense People can't even accept certified election results and you expect them to process that aliens exist?  That's rich.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elonmusk Is that the decryption from 'The Mandalorian' or that ex-Israeli leader talking about aliens, or both?  :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sparklingtechie @charliekirk11 @EricTrump Well, they've *presented* in court, but they haven't presented anything credible.    I'm really struggling with figuring out if these people are reallly *THAT* delusional or dishonest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trschmidt85 Kind of scary that these people need a wire to say the stupid shit they ramble about.  Very curious to see what they would say w/o a wire.....  Scary or entertaining......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OfWaterville You're right.  That's because respectable presidents don't have rallies right next to AF1.  lol.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@marklevinshow The "decline" started in the late-70's when we significantly started outsourcing jobs overseas creating a massive gap between worker productivity and pay.

<|startoftext|>@ApolCor If that is the "mindset", they are definitely not even doing that right.  Why would we be drafting QB's?  Wouldn't you get O'line and RBs?

<|startoftext|>@runbackdave How's business?   https://t.co/nwKSBxktk7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ILXCTF oh wow, seriously?  I didn't watch the game, I just saw this as my "trending" feed.  https://t.co/LSOKaSXkw4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gnashty7 Didn't watch the game, but this was my "What's happening" feed as of a few minutes ago?  Guessing it didn't go well?  https://t.co/Hi8JOU2a8I<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's my "trending page" currently.  Guessing the @BearsLocal @ChicagoBears game didn't go well?  Uh oh.....  https://t.co/974DthystD<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChicagoBears @ProvenIT_  https://t.co/zZwWkIFFph<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMikeWilbon I don't know as I didn't bother to watch today's game.  Gave up, reclaimed 3+ hours out of my week, and not in a bad mood this Sunday.    Guessing it didn't go well?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckGrassley You do realize that Mr. Flynn admitted / plead guilty *TWICE*, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scott_Negron @MrMichaelBurkes Actually, that's *EXACTLY* what I'm saying.  Biden-Your evidence is from &gt; 40 years ago.  Trump-*CURRENTLY* behaves in ways that support racism &amp; violence.  Right/Wrong American was a much different place 40+ years ago.  Some moved on, others apparently haven't.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BearsOutreach @BearsLocal @ChicagoBears Good stuff guys!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlanaKStewart Never heard any of that evidence.....  But here's the "witness".  I think I lost brain cells listening to this....   https://t.co/dw9Kr0rOKj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scott_Negron @MrMichaelBurkes P.S. I did appreciate the fact that you at least made an effort.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scott_Negron @MrMichaelBurkes You got the quote right, but it was from 1975.    Who would have thought that people could change over the span of 45 years?    Any chance you have something more recent?  Would be far easier to believe you if you could point to something say ... in the last 30 years or so????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scott_Negron @MrMichaelBurkes Hey, you got one right.  He actually said this one.  He clarified that is not what he meant and apologized.  Apparently no one was offended or he wouldn't have been on Obama's ticket, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scott_Negron @MrMichaelBurkes and ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scott_Negron @MrMichaelBurkes I'm not sure what I'm "welcome" for....  Nothing but invented evidence mixed with some 'half-truth'/out of context statements.  I thought you had evidence?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scott_Negron @MrMichaelBurkes 1st "quote" - Evidence he said that?  I couldn't find anything.  2nd quote - He did not say that.  He did make comments in the early 1970s about desegregation, though.    Again, Trump is actively supporting racists and inciting violence against U.S. citizens.  Try again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scott_Negron @MrMichaelBurkes Taken *WAY* out of context.  At the time he made these comments it was after Wallace denounced his past and was doing *GOOD* for the community.  Trump, on the other hand, is actively encouraging racism and violence towards U.S. citizens.  Try again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JennaEllisEsq The last time I checked ABA ethics rules frown on lawyers making false statements and/or engaging in deceitful conduct.    Stating matter of factly that AZ has engaged in election 'corruption' and disenfranchised voters without providing any proof seems like a risky proposition.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AZGOP They didn't certify a false election.  The certified a valid election.  Instead of complaining about conspiracies, I have a suggestion:  put together a compelling case for how your party *HELPS* AZ residents.  If you do that *and* implement it, you'll probably win elections.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlanaKStewart Just checking in on that evidence .......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@politico Agree 100% and was saying that from the start.  I think everyone agrees that reform is needed; however, "defund the police" is really bad messaging.  Anyone that takes it literally is going to discount you as being unrealistic and naive.    This message cost congressional seats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec The Trump Vaccine? If he's taking credit for COVID related items, what about all of the people that have died unnecessarily due to poor management / Trump's insistence to ignore expert medical advice?

<|startoftext|>@atrupar These people are so ridiculously delusional.....  On that note, if it is the "Trump Vaccine" are all the dead people the "Trump Culling"?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MZanona What will this solve?  Worst case is that Nancy Pelosi ends up as President....  That would seem worse for Republicans than Biden.   These guys aren't very smart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kaitlancollins For what?  1990's Notre Dame football?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scott_Negron @MrMichaelBurkes Since you're not "making shit up" and you are 100% truthful, why don't you show us your evidence that Biden is :  - known racist - liar - thief   and that he is 'propped up' by scumbag liars   Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tracybeanz Tracy, can you provide some specific proof demonstrating the fraud that would support your claim that Trump won?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMattGaetz You're right, when you are delusional, *nothing* is off the table.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ksorbs Yes, he won 2nd place in a 2 person race.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgePapa19 Oh, ok.  So now the "massive evidence" is "classified".....  That's funny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlanaKStewart As an "intelligent person", can you call out some *specific* evidence referenced in these 'hearings' which demonstrate this "massive fraud"?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christina_bobb As a "reporter" for a "news network", would you care to explain to us exactly how he has 'betrayed the people of Arizona'?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Coach_Yos @ChicagoBears That sounds believable.... sad... but believable....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scott_Negron @MrMichaelBurkes You should probably try getting your news from more than one source.  You might have a very different opinion.  (but you probably won't since there's a pretty obvious MO for Trump supporters...)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @OANN @dougducey I don't support fraud at all.  If there is fraud, I'm right there with you and anyone else fighting against that.  With that said, WHERE'S YOUR PROOF?  Surely you can share it with us, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearBurner I'd argue for us flopping to get a higher draft pick; however, I have no faith that we'd actually make a good draft pick with it.....    Only way this shit show changes if if we all cancel our tickets and stop buying merchandise....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChicagoSports That's confidence inspiring.......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ConradVols @ChicagoBears I'd totally take him back at this point....  We're so f'ed.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mlc118 That is indeed scary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Coach_Yos @ChicagoBears Has it really been 43????  I knew it was a lot, but .....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DirtDerg2000 It may not help, but it won't hurt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthewkentgen @ChicagoBears @The_Dream99 oh my naive child.....  :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiSportUpdates The offense is .... offensive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AaronLemingNFL It wasn't a great performance, but I get where you are coming from.  Surely they get a free pass now and again given how much they've contributed.  (and how badly GB committed uncalled penalties against the D)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kfishbain I'd really love to know WTF is going on in the locker room at half time......    Assume it is more about the *other* team making basic adjustments to counter whatever simple tweaks Chicago made to the offense from the week prior.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChicagoBears @IGSEnergy Maybe you should send some of the Tweets to ownership so they can see that things need to change.......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rob32944175 @sdaniel04e @Peter_Bukowski I guess I edited the game tape then, right?    🤦‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearsLocal No more gear for me until you guys find a way to put together a COMPETENT front office who can draft / develop talent.  It isn't enough to make a huge FA signing here and there.  It just wastes your money.  Yet another season down the drain.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wingoz @PatrickMahomes Stop reminding me, lol.  The *bigger* question is: Would Mahomes be "Mahomes" if the Bears drafted him?    I think Mitch was a bad choice regardless, but genuinely curious if Patrick would be the same QB or if we're simply cursed here in Chicago.  (due to bad development ability)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@runbackdave You must not have many pieces left at this point.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Johnathan_Wood1 His fumble, interceptions, and poorly thrown passes are clearly better than Foles.  Sure, he is more mobile, though.  I'm not convinced that makes him better than Foles though.    Absolutely positive he isn't "clearly better".  Agree 100% that we're screwed either way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WaddleandSilvy I turned that game off pretty early, it was too depressing.  Definitely reminded me that Trubiski isn't anything close to a solution.  Defense looked pretty bad too.    Bears teams are continually out coached and draft/develop poorer talent.  #MakeItStop......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_Bukowski That happens when you hold the guy literally all night.  It would not have mattered, but watch the film and realize your OL wasn't that good, the refs were that bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@barstoolsports Yeah, I knew that wasn't going to turn out very well, lol.  Waiting to hear the excuses from the Mitch apologists...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SportsCenter Waiting for all of the "See it wasn't Mitch" people to come up with new excuses for him....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonLaCanfora "Teams run out of positions in games at time"     Oh come on....  This is very atypical due to a very atypical situation.  @NFL should allow some sort of remedy to this and not screw a team out of a game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBCSports I find it ridiculous that the @NFL isn't allowing this game to be postponed / allow some sort of "extra special" measure so that the Broncos can field a playable team.    I'm not a @Broncos fan, but given the circumstances... (e.g. sub in coach that knows offense at least...)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drdavidsamadi Japan has a high suicide rate.  While there is a 2nd wave uptick, please don't misrepresent the data to imply fighting COVID is worse than not.  The real data point is they have *only* ~2,000 COVID deaths compared to US &gt;250,000 deaths.  (a real study:  https://t.co/3HBLjn8ni1)  https://t.co/0cAYOipjDn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @OANN @newsmax People should watch news from MULTIPLE sources.  Watching all of your news from one source leads to people getting locked into a 'safety bubble' where they no longer believe reality, only what they want to believe.  Fortunately you don't know anyone like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump It's been 26 days now of "it's coming" "you will see" "fraud fraud fraud".  You've lost ~30 court cases where bipartisan judges have citied lack of evidence.  Your own lawyers have admitted to no evidence of fraud.  Put up or shut up, PLEASE.  #PresidentWhoCriedWolf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottMGreer #1 - Anyone who posts their "IQ" in their bio isn't smart #2 - Japan *NEVER* went into a lock down #3 - Japan has one of the LOWEST infection / fatality rates from COVID.  Only **2,000** people have died in Japan due to COVID  Stop lying and/or misrepresenting data<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReallyAmerican1 Yes!  Show those two!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillKristol Good point Bill.  Republicans, please don't vote if you don't trust the equipment.  That will show everyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anneapplebaum Follow's Trump's MO perfectly:  Became a self-made millionaire who was given hundreds of millions  #ArtOfTheDeal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jennybethm Do you have some evidence / proof that you would like to share with the public that the election was a fraud?  It's been ~30 days with no evidence provided.  There are also ~30 failed court cases where judges have stated they haven't seen any evidence.    #PutUpOrShutUp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kurteichenwald Pretty nuts, right?  Of course the real reason they are so adamant they won is that *their* fraud failed this time unlike 2016.  That's why the exit polls didn't match poll results, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KelemenCari @realDonaldTrump Who exactly are you planning on fighting?  The majority of voting citizens who voted Trump out?  Seems rather undemocratic, but .....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandPaul Still trying to figure out if you are genuinely this dishonest or uneducated.  I'm leaning towards dishonest, because the alternative is really hard to believe.  Democratic voters voted by mail.  Mail ballots were counted later than in-person votes.  Enough already.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OANN Yes, it should be very entertaining.....    As a "news" network, how about you guys do the general public a huge favor and publish some of this 'proof' we've been hearing about for ~30 days.    Would be HUGE for your ratings, would help Trump, and would convince the public.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carriesheffield @JustTheNews @RealAmVoice @PhillDKline @JennaEllisEsq @txelectionlaw @w_terrence @JackBrewerBSI @KMCRadio @jason_meister @TeamTrump BREAKING:  Yet more bullshit insinuations without any real evidence.  It has been almost 30 days now and not one single shred of actual proof has been presented.  The only thing presented to the public has been a string of lost lawsuits w/ judges stating no evidence was provided.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Elisa_freedom @SidneyPowell1 @LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump @GenFlynn @LLinWood @krakenwood @KrakenWood1 @GaSecofState I'm still not sure if you people actually believe this garbage or are just parroting it because it fits your personal agendas somehow.

<|startoftext|>@JDRucker @JDRucker - Still waiting on that explanation........<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenMastriano Really?  Can you provide a link to this mounting evidence?  We've heard for weeks about this; however, all we have seen are court cases getting tossed and judges stating that no proof is being provided.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ginacarano The first thing we need to do is make it illegal for people to make false claims about the election process.  Claiming fraud without providing a shred of proof should be criminal.  Curious if you have any proof?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedcruz I'm not even sure what that means, but hopefully you are inviting all of the Texans who are waiting in hours long lines for Thanksgiving food to come by your house and have some Turkey.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Surely if you had such compelling evidence, you would bring that into court, right?  You wouldn't need to appeal to state Republicans to subvert the normal process.  Why don't you have ...the COURAGE to show the world your evidence?  THE WORLD IS WATCHING!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KimMangone Should be arrested.  Him, and others, are intentionally lying about the election results in an attempt to subvert our democratic process.  This is not normal nor acceptable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neal_katyal I wish you were right that this is "way over"; however, we're just getting started.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdwardNorton Agree 100% that this is the plan.  He knows the second he leaves the WH, he's in deep shit.  Can't cut a deal or it just enables future instances of this.   Crazy times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisCuomo Were you really surprised, though?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Knesix I guess if your goal is to emulate a press secretary who lies to the American public and refuses to even listen to press questions, then yeah.... she's a great role model.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DigitalEphermia @PressSec Odd, it looked to me that the press secretary provided more lies to the American people and avoided calling on reporters who would ask actual questions.    I get people will disagree on policy, but this type of behavior is ridiculous and should not be condoned by anyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Disney - Seriously?   https://t.co/pnTsF0oegl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrunkFoles Best running quarterback, sure.  The problem is he can't complete a pass &gt;15 yards.    Foles doesn't have enough time in pocket for a &gt;15 yard pass play to develop.    :shrug:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawindycityP Notice how since plays like that happened, we've had significant losses on the o'line and we've played tougher opponents?  Thinking that Mitch is a solution is wishful thinking.  Its a catch-22.  Foles can pass, but doesn't have time. Mitch can't pass, but is mobile.  Ugh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JDRucker @FoxNews When you claim a person is an asshole, they might be an asshole.  When you claim that everyone else is an asshole, then *you* are probably the asshole.  Same logic applies to claiming everyone else is "fake news".....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ACTBrigitte I'm not going to say anyone is lying; however, you can truly believe you are "right" and be wrong.  All I will say is that if you know "exactly" how the election was "rigged" then you should provide your evidence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HerschelWalker People making claims w/o evidence are the ones "playing with this election".  Show some evidence and *then* there's something to talk about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgePapa19 Spreading claims such as these without any evidence really should be criminal.  If there is evidence, put it out there for all to see.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Hoosiers1986 @NYGovCuomo A Donald Trump supporter claiming a Democratic Governor is "garbage"?  I'm shocked.    Curious if you have any metrics for why he is "garbage"?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmberKansas99 @DPWIMM @realDonaldTrump Twitter... and government agencies.... and medical experts.... and voters ... and bipartisan election committees ... and ...   It's a sad state we live in where the president consistently lies, but it is what it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPWIMM @realDonaldTrump At this point, they should just block his content.  Seven minutes is too long when you have millions of followers, etc.  It is unfortunate, but that is the reality we are living in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec Speaking of slanderous rhetoric that is toxic for our country, thoughts about president &amp; Republican leadership continually claiming the election was a fraud w/o providing proof?  If concerned about achieving "unity", perhaps transition activities shouldn't be blocked either?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec @camanpour @CNN Pretty sure you guys lost the moral high ground after you started putting kids in cages?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec @realDonaldTrump Hopefully, their successes can offset the failure of leadership from the White House.  This is especially relevant as WH "experts" are advocating for people to ignore safety guidance from experts.  Not surprised to see the WH try to swoop in and get some credit, though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Where was all of this concern for electronic machines in '16/ '18/'20 states you won? Stop being a baby &amp; act like an adult. You lost, it happens. Stop listening to the "Yes Men" you've surrounded yourself with and get some real advice.  Regroup for '24 if you want another shot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan @realDonaldTrump And in Ohio, you can get elected to Congress even while hiding abuse....  Crazy states.   https://t.co/JTW35HTzvZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieLoukas @LarrySchweikart Where I am at, it has hit businesses hard as well.  We are doing what we can to order local and keep $ in town; however, a lot of places that rely on 'foot traffic' are getting crushed.  Best thing we can do is thoroughly follow pre-cautions so that businesses can re-open ASAP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonjkerr @GovPritzker Sure.  Instead of wanting to help prevent unnecessary deaths, lets write your AD/principal/superintendent because sports is *THAT* important.  Yes, it sucks, 100% agree.  But this is a coachable lesson.  (sometimes you have to make hard choices for everyone's benefit)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllieLoukas @LarrySchweikart Well guess I will avoid Libertyville..  With that said, this is a rock &amp; hard place.  If government is going to mandate closings, there needs to be a way to compensate / help the owners.    People can help as well by following safety precautions so we can re-open more quickly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaelsobrien Hrm.... let's see.....  Help prevent unnecessary deaths or High School Sports.  Is it really that hard of a decision to make?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OleMurica "Truth" requires evidence.  There is significant evidence showing that elections were run fairly.  There is no evidence showing that there was widespread fraud.  Spreading tweets stating the election was fraudulent w/o proof = misinformation/fear mongering and s/b blocked.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RudyGiuliani @realDonaldTrump Surely you have some proof to provide, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Now its a "fake recount"?  I see a pattern here.    If all of these elections are rigged and fake, why did Republicans gain House seats and keep control of Senate?  #Election<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The reason why they vacated the result and chose a run-off in December was they found ~1,000 votes w/ potential issues.  The race was decided by only 10 votes.  Perhaps if you were that close to Biden they'd extend you the same courtesy?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SONNENFELDTKID2 I bet the Colts are happy about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TommyK_NFLDraft To be fair, I don't think anyone anticipated the amount of O'line issue......  Doesn't fix all the problems, but it is a big part of offense issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CSM_MemesInsta lolololol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChicagoBears @LarryMayer - Did Nagy only give him the same 6 plays to call or ? What a train wreck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LucaKr1sp Tell us how you really feel.  :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiSportUpdates Not mentioned in breaking news:  Nagy gave Lazor the same 5 plays to pick from.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WatchYourTone4 Seemed like more of the same plays to me ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hthill Oddly, the plays seemed the same, though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zack_Pearson Spoiler - They also played tougher opponents and now have lost how many O'line players?  Agree Foles isn't a savior, but he hasn't been the only variable since that "2-0" start.    Regardless, looks like this season is over... at least now I get my Sundays back...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arturasfanclub I saw another f'ng bubble screen too ..... god damn....  Nagy didn't even call it.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheKostos Yeah.... this is brutal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ESPNStatsInfo Any chance you have a stat for "How many times now the Bears waste timeouts before the half?"  Vikings on their ~20, ~1 minute left, 2nd &amp; 10, 3 timeouts.... Lets watch the clock burn....  @ChicagoBears   #MondayNightFootball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonMillerinDC You mean out of millions of votes, there'd be a *mistake* somewhere?  Completely amazing.  I guess that Republican county with Republican politicians conspired against their own guy, right?  Congrats of the addition of ~748 votes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CamWorrell @ChicagoBears That doesn't explain road game failures either.  The field doesn't help, but the field has nothing to do with turning 4th and inches into 4th and 10+  Pretty sure things like that have far more to do with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pdelfine @Xfinity Oh wow, so you had this issue in 2016?  It's Nov-2020 and the exact same thing is happening to me today in Illinois.  Almost 15+ minutes of non-stop amber alert.  I guess no NFL for me today.  Come on @Xfinity ......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rjohnston4 @comcastcares Funny you say this.... EXACT thing is happening to me today during NFL.  Had the same amber alert now for almost 15 minutes straight.  Ever going to fix this @Xfinity as it seems that this has been a problem for months....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kimcxlt My @Xfinity TV has been blasting these almost non-stop for the last 15 minutes.  I think that's a bit excessive.....  (especially given I'm 100's of miles away and can't do anything about this situation...)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@larryblakeley @FoodieGrizzly I 100% agree with you that she would eat my lunch (after stealing it) and would blame Democrats for it.   @foodiegrizzly - Did she really go to Harvard?  Like *THE* Harvard?  Yikes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DC_Draino Interesting that his own agencies are saying there was no fraud then.  Odd.   https://t.co/IOT2RQolSc  It's not like Trump has personal motivation to claim fraud, right?  P.S. Why is Trump's "election defense fund" putting money directly in *HIS* pocket?   Odd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KLoeffler @realDonaldTrump Are you like the band playing on the deck of the Titanic?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ksorbs You may need to take remedial math if you counted over 1 million people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DineshDSouza Actually.....  this demonstrates that Trump *was not* popular; otherwise, he would have won the election.  It seems that non-presidential Republicans are *more popular* than him.    Personally, assume this has more to do with the "defund the police" calls.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kirstiealley @realDonaldTrump Reminder - When was the last time you were relevant? Cheers?  Speaking of, can we please CLOSE THE DOOR on this election cycle and begin the proper transition activities w/o lying to the public about fraud.  (or provide some real evidence of such)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan I personally have no issue waiting for the states to certify.  What I *DO* have an issue with is Republicans, including the president, crying election fraud when there has been no evidence of such.    $.02<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgePapa19 The military is "with" the constitution.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump If your party has been in charge for the last 4 years and your goal was to "drain the swamp", why are you still stating it's a swamp?  Did you fail?  Or did you forget that was the game plan 4 years ago?    P.S. That isn't anywhere close to 1 million people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PRPAChicago @BearsFilmRoom @danorlovsky7 Its not all Foles' fault.  They have played tougher opponents since beginning of the season.  O'line has also been WORSE than start of season.  (injuries &amp; COVID)  Play calling (to fit the talent) is a major issue right now, though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bfergie4042 @rickytrevinot @BearsFilmRoom @runbackdave @danorlovsky7 But Dan is right.  If you have a bad O'line, you ..... adapt.  You can't have Nick Foles as QB sitting in the pocket for an extended amount of time.  You need up tempo and quick passes.    Interestingly, this was Foles' complaint.  (e.g. he calls plays that I know we can't run)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArieLJLit @BearsFilmRoom @danorlovsky7 Agree, but if I see one more bubble screen or run up the gut play .....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera Claiming fraud w/ no proof isn't "fighting until the bell", it is attacking the heart of our democracy.  (as is perpetuating that lie to the public)  I used to think of you as a "kick ass reporter"/investigator.  Now you sound like a partisan shill.    What happened to you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump Your "realist" friend is *NOT* "doing the right thing".  If you were a real friend, help him realize the damage he is doing.    - Want to wait for votes / certification - OK. - Claiming Fraud with no proof - NOT OK  As an investigative journalist you know better, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PAAttorneyGen and to be 100% clear, these ballots **were not** already counted; therefore, there is no actual impact?  (at least that is what I've read)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kayleighmcenany @TeamTrump Why do you lie so much?    They **never counted** these votes.  They were collected, but put off to the side in anticipation of a legal challenge.

<|startoftext|>@paulsperry_ @realDonaldTrump You realize this was a story from September?  They discontinued this *before* the election and did not count those.  *sigh*  https://t.co/ULIGNqAeTC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BuckSexton @realDonaldTrump They were allowed in, stop lying.    In regards to the "good reason", yeah there was... COVID.  They were asked to keep a distance to protect workers.  Perhaps if Trump &amp; team did a better job managing COVID, this wouldn't have been an issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Well that is a good place to dig a bigger hole for your campaign.....  #Elections2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Perhaps if *YOU* handled COVID better, we wouldn't still need safety precautions.  "Your" observers *were* allowed in, they just had to maintain a distance to protect poll workers.  Please stop, this is embarrassing for everyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @JonathanTurley Any actual evidence or just blowing more smoke?  I don't recall any complaining in 2016 when you took MI?  Funny how that works.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump 1 - Obama wasn't running against you.  You've polarized a lot of people and they came out to vote  2 - Your numbers are pretty suspect, though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump 1 - You weren't complaining in 2016 when they "called" you w/ slim margins.  2 - They don't "call it", they project. The states certify their election results.  If you don't understand this yet, you need to find some better advisors or listen more carefully to the ones you have.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrPaulGosar @realDonaldTrump @AZGOP @VP @ali @GOPChairwoman @GOPLeader I'd really like for people to stop rambling about 'fraud'.  So far the court "challenges" have been thrown out because no proof has been provided.  Repeatedly claiming 'fraud' w/o proof doesn't make it reality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaeljknowles @realDonaldTrump I don't think the court challenges are going to change anything; however, I agree that there's no reason to concede until after any/all recounts &amp; court events are resolved.  I would like to see actual evidence; otherwise, we shouldn't be ranting about fraud, though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiRuxinBGO That's such a stupid comparison.  O-line is in way worse shape and some of the games have been against tougher opponents.    Trubiski has been on team for ?4 years? and still can't make a 15+ yard pass consistently.  Sorry, but that is ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@barstoolcarl Interesting observation from the game?  Sure he didn't light things up, but he didn't allow a bazillion guys into the backfield, make players drop/fumble balls, or commit a bazillion penalties...   :shrug:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMikeWilbon Enlighten me how Mitch makes this better?    He can't pass.  Since we have no line and can't run, we'd have nothing then.  Sure Foles isn't mobile, but if we didn't commit a bazillion STUPID penalties or fumble the football at inopportune times, we'd be doing OK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@runbackdave Honestly, we're screwed either way, but Mitch doesn't deserve an apology.    He can't complete passes.  When he's in defenses don't have to respect passing game.  ZERO chance of running either.    Foles at least gives us some passing.  But without a line, we're screwed anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chuckwoolery Sorry Chuck, but he's a racist.  Holding up a bible for the TVs and *possibly* getting some funding for minority schools doesn't wash away locking kids in cages or inciting all of the hate/anger at his "rallies".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samanthamarika1 That was probably before the successful speech at the landscaping company.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dyllyp and I guess in hindsight, if you're going to dig a bigger hole for yourself, what better place than a ..... landscaping company.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KermieFrogman @BettinaForget Hrm.  I think you are confusing items.  You should probably try reading again.    I *DID* provide a counterpoint to your initial statement.  I *DID NOT* accuse you of stating "either for us/against us"  Sorry you're so upset about it, but I know comprehending can be difficult.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KermieFrogman @BettinaForget That's funny, I didn't state you said that at all.  I guess you should take a second pass on my comment.  Thx<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ashfos9 @BettinaForget @kristenmeinzer I have nothing against farmers, I grew up in farmland.  Its the shitty politicians they continually support that are the problem.

<|startoftext|>@TheChiefHeretic @BettinaForget @simongerman600 Honestly, I'm all for a split.  Tired of getting blamed for the crap big corporations/conservatives do to their own supporters.  Wonder who they'd blame at that point....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Karsomendrake @mollycrager @KindofCurly @LatterDayMoroni @BettinaForget Not this guns shit again...  Every election someone is fear mongering about losing guns.  Every day on Fox during before/during Obama this was the mantra.  Guess what, it's 2020 and people *STILL* have their guns.  Can we focus on *REAL* issues please?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KermieFrogman @BettinaForget As opposed to urbanites losing all of their stuff to 'folks in the country'?  Odd argument.  Frankly, I'd prefer whatever system lets everyone *work together* as opposed to turning literally every decision into a fucking "you're with us or against us" argument.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump There is accurate and it is no doubt an impressive number.  Fortunately/Unfortunately, your challenger got more votes.  It was good to see people come out and exercise their right to vote in large numbers!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Can you clarify which election you are referring to?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taimoor1x @realDonaldTrump Perhaps it looks like that if you are detached from reality....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_gh0stn Elon was a HUGE mistake though.  Love his tech and assume that is why he got the Iron Man nod, but he's definitely not on "that team".    Connery - Yeah I get the women grips, but he is a bit of a legendary badass type and assume that is why he's there.  9.5/10  :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBSTattoos1 @BettinaForget Perhaps that's because illegals are attracted to areas where they can find work which would be the more densely populated areas?  Correlation != Causality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshtpm This is *NOT* over.  You still have to worry about delegate stealing by state government's.  You are mostly correct about the 'illusion'.  In addition to mail-in delay, there were numerous attempt to disenfranchise voters and given Trump past projections, probably fraud as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillKristol Unfortunately, the decent ones have already spoken up....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 Yes!  They should stop at the Postal Service and figure out why they dismantled high volume equipment right before an election and disobeyed federal judge orders to expedite ballots.  Then they should investigate the closing of polling locations, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kphextwin @joshtpm Probably about ~50 million of them.  The other ~16 million *IS* voter fraud on their part.  Don't forget everything Trump says is projection.  If he is blaming Democrats for fake ballots / vote count hacking / etc., that means *THEY* are doing that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshtpm @newtgingrich - Spouting lies about the election, election process, and polls is ... election tampering and that is ... against federal law.  When should they come and pick you up?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donaldrusso994 @GovRonDeSantis @marklevinshow How about you provide some **PROOF** of fraud and then we'll talk about delegates.  This "law and order" crowd sure seems to like talking about treasonous / anarchy topics...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SalesWhisperer @lilybart15 @Harlan 89% of *REGISTERED VOTERS*  If you've registered to vote, you are already more likely to vote than a non-registered voter.  Given the stakes this year, not terribly surprising that they would actually show up and vote.    Keep in mind, WI has same-day registration as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ericjgibbs @Harlan @RedEaglePatriot This is incorrect.....  *sigh*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyannMcEnany @kayleighmcenany I find this an interesting statement in regards to US elections given that Donald Trump isn't religious while Biden has been a life long Catholic?  I get that religious types typically vote Republican, but such a weird claim to make....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abigailmarone @kayleighmcenany Because ... they are .... no one was keeping them "out of the build/room", they had them further away for COVID concerns for election workers...  Regardless they agreed to move them closer.   https://t.co/iXITbDs8v6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kayleighmcenany Why do you people lie so much?  Do you literally have *zero* integrity?  They are allowed at the locations, they (and other) observers were at a distance due to .. COVID.    Regardless they agreed to move them closer.   https://t.co/iXITbDs8v6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump #1 - False. #2 - This doesn't even matter at this point, but ok.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrumpWarRoom @kayleighmcenany This fake video again?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyannMcEnany @kayleighmcenany .... because it is a fake video ......  Surprisingly big tech companies are good about catching fake videos.  Go figure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kayleighmcenany @JamesOKeefeIII Send the whistleblower to the FBI, or other credible agency, to have this verified.  Wouldn't that make more sense than spamming social media?  (unless it isn't real and you're just trying to stoke the fire....)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidwebbshow @kayleighmcenany @ReaganWorld It would also help the party to survive if they stop locking kids in cages, didn't allow hundreds of thousands to unnecessarily die due to improper handling of deadly viruses, etc., etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader @kayleighmcenany Definitely recounts in multiple states are coming given the close margins.  With that said, counting votes isn't a "battle".  We're not "at war" with each other.  Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.  The process should *always* be respected, though.  #ElectionResult2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump @kayleighmcenany You're right, It isn't controversial!  Hopefully the pending states will finish counting their legally cast votes so we can get final results.  Glad to see everyone is on the same page.  #Election2020  #ElectionResults2020  #Elections2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kayleighmcenany ...and apparently he supports Biden.  That actually would make sense considering Biden actually attends church and practices his religion.    Maybe God's upset about that tear gas bible holding stunt?  #ElectionResult2020  #Election2020 #Elections2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What did the count ever do to you???  https://t.co/VFiebBFpxL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump If someone knows where they are, then they aren't missing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@planterspunch7 @GOPChairwoman Don't forget the people banging on the voting center windows demanding for vote counting to stop.  (? or start ?) depending on what state they are in.    Or the twitter claims about "claiming delegates" regardless of vote counts...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kennycovington1 @GOPChairwoman I'm 6'4 and 245lbs and the guy you are referring to is way *ahem* larger *ahem* than me.  You need to add *at least* 50-75 lbs to your description.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman I'd like to make a report.  There is this guy.  He keeps tweeting and demanding that multiple states should STOP counting legitimately cast votes.  He's also unilaterally decided that he is going to take electoral college delegates regardless of the vote counts.  Please help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrierWHStaff @TheRealHoarse I'd like to make a report.  There is this guy.  He keeps tweeting and demanding that multiple states should STOP counting legitimately cast votes.  He's also unilaterally decided that he is going to take electoral college delegates regardless of the vote counts.  Please help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet Because people have different opinions of local/state vs. national elections?  This isn't anything new.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@newsmax @realDonaldTrump For people named Donald Trump, that is correct.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylenabecker I don't know the numbers, and you could very well be right; however, what does it matter if they call it for him right now or in a day when they are comfortable with the numbers?  NC going in either direction doesn't solve anything at this point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NateSilver538 If those are Atlanta area voters, could be bad times for Trump.    Curious how odd it is that all of these battle ground states are within 10-50K votes?  Knee jerk reaction is that this would be hard to believe, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SebGorka @realDonaldTrump @JennaEllisEsq Help me out here, but you guys really don't see how ridiculous that sounds?  He's in no position to know what is / is not "legal votes" &amp; zero evidence has been provided showing any fraud.    This is a statement you would expect from a third world dictator, not a US President.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HeyTammyBruce Kindly point to your evidence supporting election fraud **against** Donald Trump, please.   (and no, Trump tweets are not evidence...)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickJFuentes @GOP ?  Step in and do what?  Stop state's constitutional rights to count votes?    You guys crack me up.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ScottAdamsSays that's funny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The_Dream99 OMFG hahahaha  That one Saints player was looking at you like:  "Dude, you ok?"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rossjonesWXYZ Yeah, you're 12 hour shift of voter frauding......  (I'm kidding... I'm kidding)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthewamiller You probably want to research how the president is actually selected and then realize that there is still a potential for this election to be stolen.  You should be very concerned about what the President is saying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maddow It's funny until he starts colluding w/ red states to install delegates that will vote for him regardless of the state's vote.  (and uses all of the "proof" he's been spouting as justification for that action)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Acosta One person's problem is another person's opportunity.  Surely they'll invent some creative bullshit to justify the seemingly obvious inconsistency.  They can go to court all they want, it won't help.    You should be more concerned about delegate selection @ state level.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepAdamSchiff You need to expound more.  His next step will be to attempt to install delegates who will vote for him over the wishes of the votes.  His justification for doing this will be all of the items you cited above.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gtconway3d Even if he "loses", this isn't over as he'll try to install electors that will select him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaryLTrump "Law and Order" dictates it, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therecount @RudyGiuliani - Reality and Logic dictate that, yes, you are either terribly stupid or dishonest.  I don't have sufficient information to determine which, though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RudyGiuliani @realDonaldTrump I can't tell if you are that dishonest or unintelligent, but there is no "stealing" here.  It is rather simple.  Democrats voted by mail in larger numbers and those are the ballots being counted now.  Republicans had larger numbers at the polls and those votes were counted first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DineshDSouza @RudyGiuliani I can't tell if you are that dishonest or unintelligent, but there is no "stealing" here.  It is rather simple.  Democrats voted by mail in larger numbers and those are the ballots being counted now.  Republicans had larger numbers at the polls and those votes were counted first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benrileysmith The real problem is his talk about "taking electors".  He's not kidding and this is something that they've been strategizing.  Even if Biden wins some of these states, they plan on replacing electors that will select him *AGAINST* their vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Basically.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 Technically he isn't "under performing" as he has more votes than 2016.  The issue is, there are more votes on the other side as well.  In regards to determining the presidential race result based on other ballot items, that stuff happens a lot.  They are not in lock step.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteHegseth @realDonaldTrump I think every rational person (D) or (R) wants all the votes counted.  Unfortunately, the person in the White House thinks he can unilaterally decide what is valid/invalid.    That is not true &amp; should scare the hell out of any sane people that our president is states such...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Reuters I'm not sure which part is scarier:  the fact that he clearly has no understanding of math or that so many people cheered this speech.  Granted the room is full of supporters / yes men, but you'd think *someone* would pause when you imply we need to stop counting real votes....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRapAgenda Wait he was really running, lol.  He wasn't even on the ballot in most states, not sure what he was expecting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jester2trife @hannahhycho @mattyports Uh, no.  Many states did not start counting mail-ins until *AFTER* the in-person polling.  Do some research before spreading stupidity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VACountryBoy94 @benshapiro By all means please share details about the 'meddling'.....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@paytonsun Other than a few plays, defense definitely showed up today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KyleBrandt I'm definitely not saying Foles had a great game, but I'd love to hear how Mitch would have made this better?  Play calling, O'line, running are the big issues at the moment.  At least Foles doesn't (always) over throw receivers by 10+ yards on passes &gt; 15 yards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamHoge I spit out my drink when he said that..... Probably true though!  :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@runbackdave Taysom can throw.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheJimmyGraham Yeah, you looked pretty rough in this.  On a side note, what was with all of the hits you were taking to the legs today?  They didn't look intentional, but WTF?  Was a little concerned as you got bent back on your leg from one of them pretty good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZMiller86 Really?    Is Mitch going to fix the O'line?  Is Mitch going to fix the play calling?  Can Mitch make completions?    Yeah Foles has made his share of stupid passes, but he also does show he can hit receivers.    Tired of watching Mitch overthrow guys 10-15 yards .....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurenceWHolmes To fix the O'line so we can run the ball?  Take the play calling away from Nagy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SlaytypeDA @ChiSoxFanTyler Ever notice how the offense moves much better in hurry up?  Guessing that is because they aren't waiting around for bone headed play calls to come in.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiSoxFanTyler I've had to endure multiple seasons of Mitch, I've seen enough.....  The last games have been tougher defenses and the O'line / running is the main issue at the moment.  At least Foles can complete some downfield passes...  (if he has time to throw...)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiMittenSpence Why's that?  So we can watch him overthrow receivers by 10+ yards?    Foles has had some tough games, but they have been tougher teams.  Foles made some mistakes, but ....  O'line is a hot mess right now and the lack of running is the current issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump A few thousand people died from H1N1 and you have let over 200,000 people die from COVID.  This type of attack on Biden makes no sense at all.  Surely you can come up with something that doesn't make you look ridiculous in the process, right?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@meridithmcgraw 100% positive that the 'leak' was his plan the whole time.  He wanted to play the victim to his base one last time b4 election.  He's more interested in boosting his fragile ego than winning an election.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mitchellreports @AshleyRParker He insulates himself in a bubble of enablers/yes men who tell him everything's all right.

<|startoftext|>@elonmusk Any chance of holding off on that $2K price bump until you accept orders for 7-Seat Model Y?  :) :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Wait, you're complaining about someone not wearing a mask?  Might be a credible complaint if you weren't actively mocking people for ..... wearing masks.  She should have worn one though, yes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Raider4x4 @HamillHimself I don't know anyone blaiming them **FOR** the virus.   They are being blamed for how they have failed to respond to it.  We have ~5% of world's population and ~20% of the world's COVID deaths.  If we're the "best country in the world", you wouldn't expect that, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HamillHimself I didn't take it as Emperor Palpatine evil laugh, more of a "Oh Shit, I'm screwed.  I'm just going to laugh nervously because I don't know what else to do"  Cringeworthy either way and I hope he gets voted out.  He's the worst.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Manawyrm Things like running an Ad-Lib / SB / etc., are interesting since that could easily be piped through the actual computer's built-in audio.  So I guess that is just a "because I can" kinda thing, right?   Pretty cool stuff!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pantomath__ Video would be far better if it didn't have the overly dramatic music, etc.  Stick to the facts and don't cheapen them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Manawyrm So theoretically, I could take an old RLL hard drive w/ its ISA controller card, plug it into this USB-ISA bus and then the virtualized computer on the PC could interact with it?    (and then I could theoretically move data from that drive to the PC's storage.  Interesting.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Manawyrm Help me out here as I'm not familiar with PCem.  You have some sort of emulation software (PCem?) which is actually able to talk to real ISA boards (via USB) as part of the emulation?  Interesting, though I'm a little confused why?  Cool, just not 100% clear what I'm seeing here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AriFleischer The irony in someone complaining about Trump being interrupted....  I watched Trump 'town hall' and I'm actually not sure what you are referring to.    :shrug:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IngrahamAngle She challenged Joe about Burisma as well.  Of course, Trump is easier to "challenge" (aka ask questions to) since he has been the President the last ~4 years and has presided over a lot of questionable situations.  Journalists ask tough questions, you should try it sometime.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TXblondegrad So its "despicable" to ask the president real questions?  I thought the "left" were the snowflakes?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FiveRights You must have some VERY low standards if you think Trump's job performance has been "superbly capable".  Wow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee Come on man, you're killing me here.  LMAO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Glad to see that this time he admitted that Lincoln has done more than him.  So modest.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan @JudiciaryGOP Did they post demonstrably incorrect information that has a direct impact on our elections and in violation of Twitter terms of service?  I can't tell if I feel bad for you or your supporters at this point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anniefreyshow The one conspicuously placed in camera line of sight behind Trump who largely/obviously nodded at every single statement Trump made?    Trump:  "Today is Thursday" Red Mask Lady:  NOD...NOD...NOD...NOD   She's literally a pro-Trump activist.  But I know you know that already.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benshapiro Why?  Because she asked the President a few real questions and held him accountable when his answers didn't align with his prior statements/actions?  Out of curiosity, exactly what question(s) triggered you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader Alternative suggestion:  Post factual information instead of unproven conspiracy theories.  It seems they don't block accounts that are communicating facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMattGaetz I guess if you consider preventing people from spreading false information as election interference, they are guilty as charged.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kayleighmcenany You forgot to mention that prior Republican party leaders, strategists, advisors, cabinet members, military leaders, etc., are also "against you".  Maybe you should reflect on why literally "everyone" says you guys are "wrong".    Bonus Points - Learn from it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProjectLincoln Thanks @DonaldJTrumpJr , I'm impressed to see such an honest commercial!  Good for you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheOgTerra LMFAO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBCNews - I guess the Trump "special" should be produced by @nbc entertainment.  A lot more fiction than news/reality...  Also, what's up with the conveniently placed "mega-head-nodders" behind Trump?  #townhalls #Elections2020 #DEBATES2020 #FactsMatter<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Tesla Any photos of the 7 seat layout for Model Y?  and .. I hate to ask, but would there be a 6 seat variant similar to Model X?

<|startoftext|>@harpjazz @realDonaldTrump Everyone grows older, only some grow up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FredTJoseph Interestingly, I have the *opposite* opinion.  The *worst* time for them to show a Trump event would be at the **same** day/time as Biden's. (as it will definitely negatively impact viewership)  Almost seems like NBC had to carry Trump and picked lease damaging slot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LolaaLaines @FredTJoseph Actually, no.  If they wanted better ratings, they would do it at another day/time when there wouldn't be a strong competitor at the same day/time slot.    NBC isn't dumb and would know that as well; therefore, I'm curious if there is something else going on here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ForestaWriter @FredTJoseph Well.... someone has to become the government mouth piece after the government is taken on..... #AmIRight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cjgproduxions @FredTJoseph Having Trump &amp; Biden head to head will do exactly that.  Need to get as many "eyes" on Biden's debate.  I'd also recommending to watch via streaming so the data can be more accurate.  (e.g. TV #'s are estimates, streaming are actual #'s)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mjfree No.  Only steadfast Trump apologists would watch his town hall if there were other options.  Let the rational / undecided voters watch the Biden town hall.  (or anything else for that manner)  Putting these at separate times will boost Trump's viewership and no one needs that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HillaryClinton The problem with your example is that women's right to vote was enabled via a constitutional amendment which is a mechanism firmly supported in the Constitution.  It doesn't demonstrate any inconsistency with her statement.  Senate should waiting until after election, though.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Aren't you like 3 years younger than him? Given both of your ages that is ~5% variance in age....  Rather odd line of attack, no?

<|startoftext|>@Brian72329568 @JOEL9ONE The issue is when you bring in a guy in only one type of scenario and then only run one type of play with him.  Makes it stupid easy to predict.

<|startoftext|>@JoshuaPotash @realDonaldTrump This reminds me when I got out of hospital after 17 days of pneumonia.  I couldn't breathe well for a while after.  Was quite scary to me.  Went from 3 hours a day of full court basketball to not being able to walk 20 feet....  Rough Stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MairinAnna He's using the railing while trying to appear like he doesn't need the railing.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Unilaterally stating that there will be no discussions until after the elections pretty much makes *YOU* the bad guy.  Even *if* you *are* right, you are applying a losing strategy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump "Sleepy" isn't actively trying to kill seniors.  "Sleepy" also didn't get (or spread) COVID by being irresponsible, you did.    Was hoping that perhaps getting infected by COVID would give you a fresh perspective, unfortunately, it looks like the same old president Trump.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Can provide proof?  I'd take you at face value, but since you lie about literally everything, it is hard to take you seriously.  As your own experts state there are no serious risks to voting by mail, I'll continue to believe that unless you have actual proof.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Marina_Sirtis Make it so.  :)   Agree 1,000%  Unfortunately many can't as they need to remain employed to provide for families / qualify for health care.  Only in the U.S. do you have to work in an unsafe environment to be able to afford health care to treat illness from said environment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvanMcMullin Debate goes on.  Put Trump / Pence in "bubbles".  Easier to mute that way.  Also would be very telling to see how Trump holds up for 60+ minutes of standing / debating.  Easy to BS a sound bite / Tweet, not so much in person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidJollyFL In person and put Trump in a fully enclosed "bubble", will make it easier to mute him.  :^)  Don't do zoom because you won't be able to see who is helping him answer questions, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidJollyFL Debate must go on, just double distance between candidates and put up safety partitions, etc.  While Trump can sound tough on Twitter and in 5 second carefully crafted video bites, 60+ minutes of standing / debating should show the country how easy it is to blow off COVID.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AP Debate must go on, just double distance between candidates and put up safety partitions, etc.  While Trump can sound tough on Twitter and in 5 second carefully crafted video bites, 60+ minutes of standing / debating should show the country how easy it is to blow off COVID.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jmwilt17 @AKonCloud @elonmusk and I should say EVEN IF there was a shoulder because it surely doesn't look like there are any.  Nothing on the left and possibly on the right.

<|startoftext|>@jmwilt17 @AKonCloud @elonmusk I don't recall saying "walk in lanes of traffic", though given your prior logic, I can see why you would extrapolate that.  Even if you walked in the shoulders, that is very dangerous as there is no protection.  You're one inattentive driver away from being killed.  Why risk it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmwilt17 @AKonCloud @elonmusk In the Reddit thread, they said they 'called it in' to Highway Patrol.  You can do that without having to manually walk up the highway risking your life.    Mile marker signs exist to make it easy to determine where on the expressway you are.  (as well as GPS)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@noel_aurelius @contrapositiv3 @elonmusk Agree about overall safety.  They are the safest vehicles tested, no doubt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmwilt17 @AKonCloud @elonmusk If you want to walk a 1/4+ mile on an active expressway, by all means, bud....  Those of us with common sense will remain in our vehicle, call it in, and return the vehicle to the dealer.  :shrug:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmwilt17 @elonmusk Use YOUR head.  U R doing 65 MPH/95 FPS +.  You will be AT LEAST 500+ feet away.  You're going to WALK on a freeway for ~500 feet to inspect?  Turn Around? OK, exit could be miles away.  Then U have to park, cross multiple lanes of traffic (on foot) to "find it"?  Come on...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmwilt17 @elonmusk Yeah, I always stop... IN THE MIDDLE OF THE EXPRESSWAY.  Are you serious?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmwilt17 @elonmusk I'd say a video clip of a roofless Model Y on the expressway is pretty sufficient.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FCalciu @Hotpockets4ever @Nathani04992006 @elonmusk Ok... bad sensor caused robot to jizz glass sealant on ground?  Sounds like an episode of Silicon Valley......  Jin YAAAAAAANNNGGGG!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zollotech @Nathani04992006 @elonmusk It's called inconsistent build quality due to poor internal controls and a rush to meet quarterly unit quantities.  Other brands have issues too, it isn't just Tesla.  But roofs?  Damn....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Che1167 @jToronto1000 @elonmusk Dude's roof rips off on the highway and all of the idiots come out to call BS?  Weird.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeanEnjoying @Nathani04992006 @elonmusk News flash, not everyone tweets every microsecond of their life on Twitter; however, if your roof blew off your car .... that might be noteworthy due to the rarity of such an event.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MonikaMeMyself @Nathani04992006 @elonmusk Wow, you people crack me up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmwilt17 @Nathani04992006 @elonmusk Seriously?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@noel_aurelius @contrapositiv3 @Nathani04992006 @elonmusk So your defense of this person's roof blowing off is that other cars have issues?  Of course that is a valid point as all cars have issues, but how many reports of roofs blowing off do you recall  BTW - Tesla is ranked *LAST* in initial quality.  Love my Tesla, but let's be real.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ray4tesla @Nathani04992006 @elonmusk Seriously?  You're implying they sabotaged the car?

Stick a billboard out your sunroof and see how quickly it rips out of your hands....  Come on.....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@amber_athey One situation was because there wasn't a choice.  The other was because the president wanted an entirely optional photo op.  Of course agents know there are risks in their line of work, but it would be nice for people to not intentionally put them in risky situations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaMarieBoothe Sure and put countless lives at risk for people who *can't* choose to stay home.  Well thought out there......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dbongino Not really.  Nixon is probably pretty far up the list.  Regardless, seems like a Freudian slip to say "WAS".  Assume that was because Trump *IS* the most corrupt president.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan Nope, not really?  Seems like you are trying to gaslight, though.  Surely you have something more productive to do with your time, no?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricTrump You think it's great that the president is intentionally exposing service agent's lives at risk for a photo op?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Even though I really don't like you, I don't want to see anything bad happen to anyone.  I hope you have been advised that "you feel better than 20 years ago" because of the effect of the medicines and that you *are not* recovered.  You need to rest and follow Dr. advice.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@luciusfgrant @nonameknown1 @flcnhvy The only thing I'm having trouble understanding is why you are being so rude over a simple discussion.  I'm moving on, have better things to do with my time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IsaacDovere Amazing timing.... almost as if they needed an excuse to avoid debating.....  Maybe he'll appear 100% fine while touting the new vaccine he took?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maggieNYT If this is real, and not a ploy to evade debates / news, then should all of those people at the first debate be concerned?  After all POTUS and entire family was there w/o masks and all?    What are the odds he comes out "fine" and says he got the new "vaccine" and he's now 100%?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luciusfgrant @nonameknown1 @flcnhvy "The problem is that it is over stated."  *DING*  To my point, trained pilots **KNOW** what "autopilot" can/cannot do.  Mass public buys a car that says "autopilot" and .... they don't know shit about how it works and some rely on it too much.  (with disastrous effect)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luciusfgrant @nonameknown1 @flcnhvy You should probably google Tesla lawsuit and you'll find plenty.  As far as states allowing it, I think its a bit of a grey area right now to be honest.    Tesla does not make up a large % of vehicles on the road so it is flying under the radar, for now.  (in my opinion)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luciusfgrant @flcnhvy If the governing bodies in Europe think it should be restricted, it should be restricted.  I don't speak for Europe.  What I do know is that it isn't perfect.  Perhaps when the next version of the software rolls out?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luciusfgrant @nonameknown1 @flcnhvy Again, I own one, I don't need a test drive.  (Possibly a 2nd in a week or two)  What is your issue with recorded video and accident reports?  That seems far more reliable than your dubious "everyone I've talked to says ...."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luciusfgrant @flcnhvy I own one, I'm not talking "theory".  Nor is it theory to find the news articles / YouTube videos of idiots using it wrong.  I know there are plenty of responsible drivers who are "super cautious" nor did I ever claim there weren't any.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nonameknown1 @ChampaPower @flcnhvy "light aircraft" - I don't recall making that categorization.    You obviously got my point and are just being disingenuous by sidestepping it.  Pilots have much more rigorous requirements than your "everyday" driver.  They know exactly what "autopilot" is/isn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nonameknown1 @luciusfgrant @flcnhvy According to the people that make the rulings, they disagree.  Given the crap you see on YouTube / read in the newspapers, I have to agree with them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luciusfgrant @flcnhvy You have far more trust in drivers than you should.  I complete "get" Autopilot is "easy" and you have to monitor it.  (and agree) But there are enough idiots out there who don't.  Just go to YouTube.    Govt's job (in this case) is to protect people, not help sell cars.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luciusfgrant @flcnhvy My point eluded you.  Pilots have a lot more experience understanding airplanes than most people do with their cars.  They clearly know what autopilot is/is not.  The same is not true of the mass public and it is more likely they would incorrectly understand/apply "autopilot"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nonameknown1 @ChampaPower @flcnhvy Regular drivers don't fly aircraft either......    Were you required to log hundreds of test hours in car, pass certifications, and maintain training before you bought your car?  I didn't think so...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ozwegian @flcnhvy I have never even thought of engaging it in my car.  Love the technology and I'm sure there are many fine engineers working on that stuff; however, there are tons of variables / situations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nonameknown1 @luciusfgrant @flcnhvy Those pesky regulations/specifications... Always trying to keep people from dying and all...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luciusfgrant @flcnhvy Perhaps it has to do with the fact that pilots require certifications, hundreds of hours of training, and are thoroughly trained on all parts of an airplane while car buyers read a couple ads, drop some money, and happily drive off.  Hope they read the manual .....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SchmittNYC I'm not if I want to believe you know better and are being disingenuous or whether you are really that ignorant.  Biden's funeral comments were for an "ex" member who denounced his past and turned his life around.  Seems slightly different than telling a hate group to "stand by".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec @johnrobertsFox So .... why not say that on TV in front of cameras?  Why tell hate groups to "stand by" at the debate.  It's the world's easiest question for a politician and he not only failed to answer it, but then he specifically name a hate group and told them to "stand by".  https://t.co/wdtBEqnFk8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamVTV It may be open, you just have to step over the dead bodies...  What you, and many others, are apparently missing is *NO ONE* wants to "close places".  If *proper precautions* were instituted and *followed* in Jan., we wouldn't need to be talking about lock downs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RubinReport I don't recall the "Ku Klux Klan" being in Kenosha or Portland.  These are two different questions....  Trump further went on to tell the "Proud Boys" to "stand by".  *sigh*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AriFleischer What, are we 5 years old now?  "Mommie, *HE* started it!"  Come on......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenTedCruz Besides the fact this meme is "full" of stupid mistakes, is this really what mature leaders of our country do?  Why aren't we talking about real issues that affect everyone instead of acting like a grade school child?  Don't you have any real substantive issues we can talk about?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amyklobuchar What he said is 100% accurate.  If he loses, he'll almost certainly end up in jail from one of the numerous lawsuits coming his way.  Unless he is placed in an MN prison, he won't be coming back......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisCuomo - Tried to watch the Ted Cruz interview and that was horribly painful.  I'm on your side of the argument, but you have to tone that down and be more professional.  Cruz could hardly finish a thought without you speaking over him.  Not a good look....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@votetimscott   "I am committed to serving the citizens of South Carolina. We must preserve liberty, freedom and opportunity for all"  Do you think Mr. Trump is preserving liberty, freedom and opportunity for all by telling a white supremacist group to "Stand By"?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SHARONKAYMILLS @9NEWSNANCY @FoxNews Biden could have stood there without saying a word the whole time and he STILL won that debate. I wish he would have pulled out a bowl of pop corn and just ate it while listening...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@9NEWSNANCY @FoxNews Of all the shit that went down last night, *THAT* is all you have?   Biden could have stood there and not said a single word all night and Trump still lost that debate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewYang $1,000 for every time Trump interrupted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Klow7 Someone needs to dub Trump's head into this video....   https://t.co/P8VEIsTB90<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cottonXdelight "at this point"?  He's been speaking out of his ass since he was born....  You see his college grades?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HKrassenstein I was very annoyed with that 'discussion' as Biden didn't even hammer them on the hypocrisy....  I thought he really missed the mark in this exchange.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JordanYanch Especially because 20 seconds prior he said "masks *are* important"  WTF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anyone else fail to understand why the moderator does cut off microphones?  This surely isn't a technical problem.  Poor debate behavior &amp; moderation made this debate far worse than it needed to be...    #Debate2020  #debate #debates #Trump2020 #BidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@revrrlewis I'm not sure what is going on here; however, it seems more likely that Giuliani is suffering from some sort of issue.  That guy couldn't even string together an argument.  That is hard to watch.  The only thing I can say is that this bunch of guys are experts in projection.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenTedCruz I guess I shouldn't be surprised to see a politician make an apolitical situation political.....  I'm sorry Trump trounced you so bad in primaries that you lost any common sense and good decency you may have had left...   https://t.co/m2wmA4l2hJ  #COVIDIOT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Reuters Biden needs to start off with : "Donald Trump hates America and is a crook.  He spent more on hair than the median family makes and paid less tax than poverty level.  He also is a horrible business man as he's $1B+ in debt and "loses" money every year"  #GrabsPopcorn<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JimCarrey Assuming the leaked info is true, there are only two options:  A)  He's a *HORRIBLE* business man.   B)  He's committing tax fraud, probably in connection with other illegal activities such as laundering.  Neither scenario is good for him, he needs to go.  (If B, go to jail)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattOnAir Thanks Nick..... that 3 (5) TD performance was garbage.  Please stop being yourself.  I really hate it when you throw completions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JBStewart That was vague, but ok.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JBStewart To be fair, the Bears played a lot better offense with Foles in.    It's amazing what happens when the QB can complete passes.  "conservative" play calling when leading a game sucks.  The Bears only had so many opportunities because Falcons offense stopped being as aggressive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattOnAir Assume we can both agree that the last possession for the Falcons was moronic.  *THREE* incomplete passes and took mere seconds off the clock?  Odd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattOnAir Another TD..... should be 4 for Foles in this game, though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattOnAir I'm sorry you can't see that he has continued to under perform since he was drafted.  Perhaps he's a friend or on your fantasy team (lol) but ......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattOnAir Mitch is a *A* problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattOnAir Foles threw it out of the back because no one was open and he was under pressure, that was the correct thing to do.   You conveniently didn't mention the two "should have been completions" to the end zone.  Graham missed the first, other is about to be overturned on review.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OpenUREyesNSee @Porterhouse320 @GlueTheComic @LakesaValentine @michellemalkin @CaliKidJMP @LLinWood So like the other ~20 guys were together and he was by himself with a fire extinguisher?  I'm sure we'll get more details at the trial, but still sounds like bad decision making.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattOnAir Agree it's not "just Mitch", but he isn't helping, so why leave him in?  Those over throws man...  been years of them.  Receives cost them some.  Defense blew a fumble which resulted in point as well.  Definitely a team effort.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Porterhouse320 @GlueTheComic @OpenUREyesNSee @LakesaValentine @michellemalkin @CaliKidJMP @LLinWood How exactly was Kyle "defending people's livelihoods" when he wasn't even near the business(es) he said he went there to protect?  Unlike the others, he was running around in the street.  He put himself in a bad situation and ruined his, and others', lives in the process.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chimpvsdog @michellemalkin @CaliKidJMP @LLinWood I'm not sure what you are smoking, but it must be pretty high quality.  How can you have fairness &amp; tireless empathy while hating other Americans?  That makes zero sense.    P.S. The **responsibility** of the presidency is the support **ALL** Americans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@d_renome @john_yazek @michellemalkin @CaliKidJMP @LLinWood @SykesCharlie I saw the footage.  Possibly self defense when he was on ground &amp; other person pulled gun?  The problem; however, is that he intentionally put himself in the situation directly leading up to all of that. Had he stayed w/ group none of this would have happened.  #AvoidableMess<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jodireese13 @LindseyGrahamSC  - I wonder if there is a reason so many people "hate your guts" all of a sudden?  I'm sure its completely random right?  Or possibly because they all "hate America"?  Oh... maybe it has something to do with your hypocrisy?   #ByeLindsey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scottsantens I don't know about "10 days" but the whole point of the money would be to *use* it and not hoarde it.  If people really need the money to survive, that won't be a problem anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MittRomney Glad to see you agree with this.    How about Postal Service?    What about SCOTUS?  Everything Trump is doing is "Belarus".   Don't be on the wrong side of history w/ SCOTUS pick please.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@elonmusk Any updates for those with "older" vehicles?

<|startoftext|>@grojas7171 @fredschroeder_1 @pambaker18 @alex_avoigt @elonmusk Yes, in *some* places there isn't an official limit; however, "no limit" does not equal "go as fast as you want".  I think I already explained that, but .....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grojas7171 @fredschroeder_1 @pambaker18 @alex_avoigt @elonmusk Thanks for clarifying that.  Seemed like you were when you stated "He's from Germany" as if that somehow made driving at a high rate of speed acceptable.  🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@grojas7171 @fredschroeder_1 @pambaker18 @alex_avoigt @elonmusk Ich weiß...Even though parts of the Autobahn are not speed restricted, you still need to drive within your ability, vehicle's limits, conditions, and traffic.    Wrecking at that speed implies one of the above was violated, possibly bad luck.  Inquiring minds want to know... :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fredschroeder_1 @pambaker18 @alex_avoigt @elonmusk Perhaps the bigger question is .... why were you going 230km/h (140 mph/h)?  You referring to a head on collision or was that your speed?  😮<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PPathole @flcnhvy I guess I'm confused, but where did he make a statement about liquid assets vs. net worth?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flcnhvy $10.3 billion in stock/stock options is still a hell of a lot better than someone who needs $600 to pay rent/eat.  Pretty sure Elon (or others) wouldn't switch positions with those people.  Surely you don't have such a poor understanding to get Bernie's point, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brenontheroad @elonmusk @richardreinariv @BillGates "Tweet 1" is below.  You incorrectly quoted him as flatly stating the internet has no commercial value.  He never said that.  From there, you have changed your "argument".  (e.g. pivoting)  I'm sorry your definition of "repeating yourself" is making a different argument each post  https://t.co/X5WbNAosUE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brenontheroad @elonmusk @richardreinariv @BillGates and again.... the discussion was not about him being "wrong".  Thanks for pivoting your argument again.    *sigh*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brenontheroad @elonmusk @richardreinariv @BillGates - First you misquoted him - Then, when corrected, you pivoted to a claim about "first world necessity" - When corrected again, you pivot to something else  For your latest pivot, no, 6.6% is not "nothing", but it doesn't support your original claim.  Next pivot?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brenontheroad @elonmusk @richardreinariv @BillGates I'm sorry, but facts do not support your claim that he was "ridiculously far off".  In 2004, only 6.6% of US commerce was through e-commerce and only 11% of world population was on internet.  Finally, the browser wars of the 90's clearly indicate Gates/MS knew what was coming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elonmusk @cleantechnica I'd agree, but ..... if I could Summon my Tesla like Knight Rider.....  that would be cooler than a Neralink.  (though I'd take one of those too!)  https://t.co/2C8sMrKaU8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brenontheroad @elonmusk @richardreinariv You are misquoting him.  He said (in 1994) that he didn't see any commercial value *in the next 10 years*.  As most of us were still on modems then, seemed reasonable. He wasn't nearly as far off as you are implying.  It's not like he said 'COVID is dumb' ...   @BillGates<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@elonmusk @ruskin147 I agree with both of you.  The demo was very light on the neuroscience; however, isn't that to be expected?  Without having technology in place to observe/experiment, you can't get anywhere.  Expect that you'll have exponential improvement on the neuroscience as tech expands.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DailyCaller He doesn't even know Biden so how he can say any of that is interesting.  Further interesting is his stance that Trump is a great guy even though he's directly contributed to tens of thousands of dead US citizens.  #LouHoltz #Clown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepDougCollins In normal times, I'd agree; however, with the current state of things, she's right.  There is bipartisan evidence that the President and Republican members worked with Russia to impact our elections.  Doesn't get much worse than that, does it?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@marcthiessen @DonaldJTrumpJr Let me get this straight, your defense of Trump's failure to handle COVID is to claim the prior admin failed when they had far fewer deaths and a vaccine?  Do you guys even attempt to think these things through or ?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KeithFrank31 @TheRickyDavila @wwredpepper The USPS *is not* a "business", it is a Constitutionally mandated **service**.    Could it be more efficient?  Probably.

<|startoftext|>@elonmusk @WholeMarsBlog Sounds awesome from a manufacturing perspective.  What would this mean in terms of aftermarket repairs, though?  (e.g. collision repair?)   Easier / Same / Harder?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC " I mean, she goes out and she yaps"  Sounds like Trump is projecting again.  Pretty all he does is "goes out and yaps", lol......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QuinnMandell @ChicagoBears If he does, that will be great.  I have absolutely nothing against the guy personally, just frustrated at **decades** of poor/inconsistent QB play in Chicago.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@elonmusk @BernieSanders It is disingenuous of you to ignore the fact that Tesla has greatly benefited from government subsidies.  (both consumer &amp; corporate)  Instead of owning up to that, you double down by implying Sanders is a big oil shill?  Come on, dude...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VictoriaIdoni Honestly, I'm all for 3rd party candidates; however, in this election I think it is far more pressing to ensure Trump is removed.  Adding more candidates is just going to fragment votes against Trump making it easier for him to get re-elected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AFP That guy **TOTALLY** knew he broke that statute.  That is why he looks back down at it for a few seconds after getting up.  I love his completely uncasual, casual walking away.

<|startoftext|>@dashing_nelson @RealLifeStarman @elonmusk The thought behind space exploration is to leave behind those who aren't willing to work together.  Populating another planet with like minded/rational people is easier than getting all of the irrational people Earth to agree.  Space is mostly just a technical challenge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieBender19 @DanRather Even if everyone 100% "safely" votes, if Trump loses this election, he will cry foul until someone drags him out of the WH.    This is why he has been consistently making comments about the election being rigged, etc.  Repeat a lie enough times w/ push back and people believe it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanRather Similar to how people don't like debating Trump.  They refuse to have a battle of wits with an unarmed opponent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jackfarrington @RealLifeStarman @elonmusk yeah I must be missing it, that sure looks like it says there is one stall open and there is ... one stall open.   (though it looks like it is taped off so that should be fixed, but no clue where you came up with 7?)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dashing_nelson @RealLifeStarman @elonmusk I think he's given up on that and is trying to get some people off this planet before everyone else wrecks it.  On the other hand, the point of Tesla/Solarcity is to help clean some of it up.  The problem is that there are too many different countries/leaders who do not agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boombrains @RealLifeStarman @elonmusk really?  it always amazes me what people focus on.  these guys just shipped people to space and back in a brand new transportation system and you're fucking criticizing his hand placement.  lol.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StringCheese87 @ChicagoBears True, but typically hasn't been enough as offense is/was garbage.  Almost won it all in 2006 w/ gr8 defense and a *FEW* flashes on offense.  The sad reality is, would have won that game w/ Kyle Orton simply because he wouldn't have made all the mistakes that Rex did in that game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@canyamanbae Exactly.  Funny how no one is talking about FL anymore.  Far too many entitled / selfish people.  No one is going to die if sports are delayed.

<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 I feel bad for people that continually have to use loaded language to scare people instead of just trying to make a logical argument.    It apparently seems to work well enough for you to attract a following; however, having a following doesn't make your arguments valid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StringCheese87 WTF do the @ChicagoBears have to do to get a QB even half as good?  Seriously.  You guys have Brett f'ing Farve and then Aaron Rodgers.  We've about 30 different guys over that same time span......    It's not fair....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dean_hegney @Lily195066 @DHS_Wolf No, I want police doing ... policing.    All of the *other* crap that has been put on their plates over the last couple of decades should be allocated to groups more appropriate able to handle it.  (e.g. mental health checks by ... mental health experts, not cops)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel so much better already.  Glad to see we're taking on major tasks such as a rose garden rebuild.

<|startoftext|>@donwinslow Appreciate the thought; however, anyone that isn't already a die-hard Trump supporter knows that is a lie.    Trump is basically a bad guy from the old Star Trek show:   https://t.co/XYdWcjcbU8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ManMadeMoon Probably.  It is a very gullible group and if you can't beat them, might as well profit from them.  After all, that is what "their" politicians are doing to them.  I do have to give them credit for convincing ~50% of country to vote in a way that HURTS THEMSELVES.  Blows my mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mamafullosong @McNaughtonArt @realDonaldTrump @EricTrump @TuckerCarlson @dbongino @LauraIngram @seanhannity I guess you didn't do well in U.S. History?

George Washington, especially, would kick the ass of any current politician R or D ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McNaughtonArt @realDonaldTrump @EricTrump @TuckerCarlson @dbongino @LauraIngram @seanhannity Is this like the ending of the last Star Wars movie, where all of the ghosts come back and help channel their powers to defeat the evil Emperor?  Looking good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MISkycar Maybe one day you guys will have a retail product???  Please?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @realDonaldTrump You will NEVER solve any problems either.  P.S. "Defund" is a horrible word choice as the intent is to reallocate funds to focus police on ..... policing as opposed to the variety of "hats" they currently wear.  (which do not make sense)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanAFournier What in the world are you rambling about?  Trump has been in office almost 4 years.  Why are you complaining about Obama?  I guess, though, that is better than talking about what is happening in Washington these days.....  #FacePalm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarlohDZN @realDonaldTrump @Yankees Unfortunately even that is very appealing given what is currently happening in Washington.  (of course that is nowhere near the truth, but dishonestly is also par for the course currently)  *sigh*<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JerryDunleavy .... Perhaps because she wasn't knocking the Mt.

Not that facts ever stopped you guys before, but ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elonmusk @kanyewest I think Trump has proven that the *last* thing we need is another *celebrity* president, come on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elonmusk @Lockl34r @Tesla @Lockl34r ... but you still need to swap modem/mcu for data, probably really swap charge port/hardware ($$$), taillights for EU spec, change config parameters for EU regulations, etc., etc.    Easier to sell / buy a EU spec version unless you are really tied to this car.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mike5517918482 This also implies that Trump committed voter fraud since he mailed in a ballot to .... Florida.  Just saying....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Teslarati @elonmusk - I've seen a prototype of this already.   https://t.co/XiF3IOPXEV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@twitteck @Elite4Jacob @Cernovich If I understand you correctly, you are stating that being shot in the back is an appropriate consequence for running away from police? Interesting.  The taser is moot as:  a) per police they are non-lethal b) per reports it was already used twice already and would not work<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cernovich I guess that just goes to demonstrate that they are not very professional and a new approach is required for public safety.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@twitteck @Elite4Jacob @Cernovich You aren't "protecting yourself" when the person is 15+ feet away, traveling away from you, and has no means of seriously injuring you from that distance.  Police do shitty things to and there need to be consequences for those actions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReavisHammond8 "Cool" story, but looks like you assaulted that guy.  *YOU* approached him.  *YOU* prompted him to go up front/outside.  *BOTH* of you got in each other's faces.  *YOU* dropped back and initiated the fight, etc.  Sure the guy is possibly a POS racist, but that wasn't right.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mattgaetz Yeah, its not like we drop bombs or send in military to on them, we just freeze their cash and give them a time out, right?

<|startoftext|>@WBFO @MikeDesmondWBFO I "love" how they just fucking leave him there and walk around like there's nothing to see.  Fucking assholes.

<|startoftext|>@donwinslow @RandPaul Honestly, *any* bill that puts an *automatic minimum* jail term is garbage.  The whole purpose of the legal system is to allow for each situation to be carefully reviewed and handled appropriately.  Bills should not be passed simply because they have emotionally charged titles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods Can you be any more dishonest or ignorant?  Democrats were not literally arresting Americans for opening businesses.  The scientific community is/was trying to **SAVE LIVES**<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nsouthern95 Knew this was coming: stage violence at legit protests, label violence starters as "terrorists", and then "link" your political / powerful industry opponents to "terrorists" group.  Figured this was coming once Trump fucked up COVID response and realized he couldn't win election<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EddieDonovan Funny, I don't see a video of a protest, there.  I see a video of criminals causing property damage.  Plenty of PEACEFUL PROTESTERS to pick from, but thanks for trying to spin bullshit.     https://t.co/n2oKxxcnS4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KingJames Kap didn't start protesting until he got benched. He opted out of contract looking for more $. He turned down offers from other teams, CFL, XFL.

<|startoftext|>@kristencheeks @MeghanMcCain - Why in the world are you so dishonest?  You realize that with "the internet" it is very easy to fact check claims like that.   You must think your followers are really stupid to make such blatantly false comments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump What a horribly IRRESPONSIBLE thing for you to post.  There is literally no context to this video and no such proof that this person is doing anything wrong.  Now he's getting death threats.  Investigate and prosecute *if* he did something wrong, but this is just out of line.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thejtlewis I continue to be amazed at people who make such stupid comments which are easily dispelled by a 5 second Google search.  (e.g. I'm waiting for the media to acknowledge his death)  Many of them reported it *before* you even posted here complaining.  Irony.  https://t.co/kpVATZZYtX<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GeekTrader No.  "Kap" didn't start his bullshit until he got benched due to his crap FB play.  What has he done with all of his time &amp; money since not being in the NFL?

<|startoftext|>@travelong6 Actually *we* warned the DNC that forcing Clinton on the voters wasn't going to go well.  I fear the same with Biden, but hoping that people will be so tired of Trump that anyone with a pulse will do at this point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarackObama While Trump is hiding in the bunker and the oval office is empty, would you mind filling in for a bit?  We sure could use the help.

<|startoftext|>@DC_Draino Way too convenient that all of those violent protests sprang up out of nothing.  Even one of the small towns near me had something happen.  Hours of peaceful protests, then magically it got violent when some unrecognized people arrived.  Very odd.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SaraCarterDC I can't tell if you people are just ignorant or intentionally misleading people.  I really hope you're misleading....

<|startoftext|>@nessnitty @NFL @nflcommish @NFLPA @Kaepernick7 For those who may not be clear on word definitions...  retired (adj) - having left one's job and ceased to work.  When was the last time he played?  Didn't he turn down offers/interviews after opting out of 49ers contract?  Is he working in NFL?  Sounds like the definition to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenPAdams @nooktastical @conorsen Especially since people leaving the Valley and working remotely will save FB **TONS** of money in  expenses.  Kinda insulting to cut pay if the workers doing the same work **and** he created a net savings for FB.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cashel @PhMai In regards to the FB discussion, I think the issue is that employees converting from working in the Valley to working from home are going to **save** FB a lot of money. Giving an employee a pay cut, in that light, seems odd.  I guess they can stay &amp; FB can pay more overall?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhMai I would understand Facebook's thought *IF* they were incurring expenses for the employee, but in this case the employee is *SAVING* FB money by working from home.  Giving them a pay cut on top seems like an insult?    (e.g. less on-site=less rent/build exp...)<|endoftext|>

Never knew how poorly paid/treated you were, deserved MUCH better.   Sit out in '97=100% OK,  Knicks '94=Ugh, but shit happens, was OK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRPGer @HugeJacket @xeviuss @KinelRyan @DDayCobra ?gun?  You ever see a real gun that looks anything like that?  Oh, for fucks sake.  She put it down on the ground, they could have easily walked up and realized it was all fake.  The owner was in the doorway telling them as well.  So was the guy with the camera.  wow....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimMurtaugh @PressSec @kayleighmcenany Yes, she's so savage for taking out of context statements, flinging it at the audience and then scurrying away before anyone could ask follow-ups.    I should become a conservative pol...  much easier work requirements, same % of approval, just avoid mirrors...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MZHemingway I love how she scurried away after throwing out the only defense she had.  Guessing that was her he notes ended.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LinZbeee @stevenmnuchin1 @LisaMei62 @axlrose Not sure what you are smoking, but damn......  I have to give it to this administration (and "conservatives") for mastering the art of getting people to support people that act *against* their best interests.  It is very impressive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevenmnuchin1 @axlrose What have you *ever* done *for* our country?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Starbucks   as a follow-up I can buy gift cards through the website with the same payment info so this seems limited to either my account or the gift card refill process.....  https://t.co/oypdv9xGF2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Starbucks - How does one get support for ordering on-line/mobile?  This hasn't worked for well over a month for me and I'm quickly growing tired of unnecessarily waiting in 30+ minute lines since I can't order in advance.  Thoughts?  https://t.co/q17WnQSPMQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SportsCenter He's probably feeling relieved that she might get a scholarship for college now!  :)  Have you seen the prices lately?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@el_cjr Reminds me of a boxing weigh in session.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeptuneRivers Kinda like how I miss going places.....  Remember.... Places?  Yes, I miss having a President with a brain.  It was such a refreshing feeling, wasn't it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mayne1Carrie You're missing out.  Apparently people are now trying to link him to the Wuhan lab.......  For Conservatives, Obama is apparently used on everything.  Kinda like salt.... or like that SNL skit "Needs more Cowbell"....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricTrump Bragging about a 49% approval rating is somewhat depressing, isn't it?  Especially considering approval ratings are typically at their highest during national tragedies/events.  Can we please focus on COVID and help people as opposed to pats on the back?  #COVIDー19 #Covid_19  https://t.co/Gzl6f5OsRu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanScavino This makes me strangely ill and gives me a migraine at the same time.  Maybe we should be focusing energy on resolving our pandemic problems?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w_terrence You're actually being used as a pawn in a larger game, but feel free to think of it as you'd like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidJHarrisJr Still blaming Obama for all your problems?  Wow.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec @realDonaldTrump Can we please just drop the charades and put Baghdad Bob as the PR man for this group already?  At least then it would be remotely entertaining.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NikkiHaley @realDonaldTrump Amazed that anyone is actively pushing for this guy at this point.  Have some respect for your party and at least put up someone who is competent.  Unfortunately for regular people, the DNC has the same problem and can't put up a viable candidate either.  So depressing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EverydayElon @elonmusk P.S.  Cancer rates, especially deaths have been dropping for years.  (primarily due to earlier detection, better treatments, people making choices to minimize cancer risks, etc.)  You should take your own advice and do some research.  https://t.co/vkXGiOfr6S<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EverydayElon @elonmusk The only thing embarrassing is your failure to process the data provided.  *TOTAL* deaths are up significantly Mar/Apr versus prior years.  Unless you think they are counting dead people 2.5X, the data does not support any argument that deaths are simply classified incorrectly.  https://t.co/cmdg8wExbM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elonmusk @Grimezsz Welcome to the real world, all of our wives/gf's are mad at us for one reason or another. :) :)   P.S.  Any good sales?  :) :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EverydayElon @elonmusk What?  Not sure what you are smoking, but that doesn't even make sense.  I'm hoping you are a troll account as the alternative would be very depressing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EverydayElon @elonmusk "Project Veritas" is a right wing "media" source known for inventing bullshit to push an agenda.    Real data clearly shows higher than "normal" fatalities since March.  As far as the death certificates, the official CDC guidance disagrees....  #StopTheBS   https://t.co/uaScuhXF9R  https://t.co/FMH7uOSySZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elonmusk @JamesOKeefeIII P.S.  Here's the official guidance on how the death certificates are to be filled out.....  They provide plenty of example scenarios at the end.     https://t.co/uaScuhXF9R  Come on Elon, you're smarter than to buy into internet bullshit.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elonmusk @JamesOKeefeIII I guess they are also instructing everyone to count dead people twice as well?  (and to put manequins in the Uhauls containing bodies that they cannot process quickly enough?)  https://t.co/U8ZT6FWG3X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SportsCenter You can clearly see he has two cards and he switches them while he "shakes" it.  #KeepDayJob<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PPathole @elonmusk (p2) With that said, ventilators are invasive and do cause problems....  A better option could have been:   https://t.co/pxV62vieEa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PPathole @elonmusk People who were put on ventilators were put on them because there was *no other* choice.  It was a last resort because the patient couldn't breathe otherwise.  Doctors were not just putting them on ventilators "just because".    Prb of death w/o =~ 99 % Prb of death w/   = ~80 %<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ant91838820 @Stingofsweden @Gfilche @elonmusk Yeah, it looks like they are over the peak.... mortuaries still need help though...   https://t.co/a9H5R4W639  But that happens every week w/o COVID, right?  Nothing to see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ant91838820 @Stingofsweden @Gfilche @elonmusk I guess consider yourself lucky.  Perhaps you could volunteer your time to assist in a harder hit area if you are that bored....   https://t.co/a9H5R4W639<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stingofsweden @Gfilche @elonmusk Yeah, there's no fuzz, just a ~12% fatality rate.  Very sensible.  The plus side is you'll kill off a bunch of people quickly and then can move on, though.....  https://t.co/EEXDvTT97E<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JMTexasPR @mmpadellan Says the even lesser known guy.....  Comical.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LucasBevan2 Can we borrow him for a while?  We'll trade you some hand sanitizer and toilet paper?  :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@socflyny The fact it is *only* an 8% lead tells you how bad Joe Biden is.  Joe's snafus, easily exploitable "issues", and lingering allegations, make him a less than ideal candidate.    I can't believe that out of ~360M people, this is the best we could come up with ...  (Trump v Biden)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackAlDavisJr @etanthomas36 @IsiahThomas oh, FFS.......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chicagobulls How'd that work out for him (@IsiahThomas ), lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThrowbackHoops @IsiahThomas-@Jumpman23  100% right.  Olympic team should be ambassadors of US basketball.  Isiah/Pistons' unsportsmanlike behavior was petty and demonstrates why he was undeserving of representing the US.    To this day he hasn't figured it out, apparently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KendrickPerkins I knew all of that back in 1998, didn't need a documentary to reach those conclusions.  The 1990's were the best basketball decade *EVER*.    [biased Bulls fan of course :)  ]<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jtylerconway That picture is probably photoshopped......  Doubt you could get them that close w/o one of them going off on the other.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@espn She can really suck.....  ummmmm...... yeah.... nevermind.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elonmusk Good.  Are you saying you'd prefer them to be full?  You plan for worst case models, do your best, and hope you don't hit "worst case".  Surely you over engineer your SpaceX rockets/capsules with the same thought process in mind, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@funkychicken @daveyalba And your point is ????  We know UV light kills germs, but your example requires no one to be in the room because ... it's dangerous to humans.    As far as this recent item, no testing has been performed and we'll have to see how that turns out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kennethmejiaLA Not sure if you are a robotroll or just bad at math; however, dividing the vote between Biden and a "green" candidate *is* going result in 4 more years of Trump.  I'm *NOT* a Biden nor a Hillary fan; however, I at least think Biden would listen to experts during a pandemic.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mike_Pence @VP @MayoClinic Good job on 'leading the way' by not wearing a mask per Mayo requirements and U.S. Coronavirus task force guidelines.    Just because you are "getting tested" doesn't mean you can't be infected and spread it in between tests.  What are you thinking?  #COVIDIOT #coronavirus<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@officialmcafee 1 Different reporting methodology surely has something to do with it.  2 Japan is run by intelligent people who took proper steps to prepare the country.  3 "No lockdown" is misleading.  Japan asked its citizens long ago to social distance and stay away from crowds. They listened<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FlyThaiMMA On a side note, does this add a new dimension as to why Biden has been adamant that the VP pick will be a woman?  😇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@caffeine_adct He should never have made it this far in the first place.  There are only two real options: 1 - DNC leadership has zero morals and wants a "company" person above all else.  2 - Politics is just like wrestling.  Both DNC and RNC have the same boss and winners/losers are scripted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JRehling Unfortunately, the Democratic party has any many idiots as the Republic party as people are blindly blaming "Bernie" for this, etc.    Unfortunately, it is *just* like Trump / Republicans.  Trump says the stupidest/crazy stuff and people still line up to defend him.  Sad state...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@artsyboy1985 Highly likely this bullshit about Biden dropping out is a Russian troll operation.    Instead of having an emotional knee jerk reaction, exactly like Russia wants, apply logic and research. (read the Senate committee reports)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maddenifico So let me get this straight.  Bernie Sanders supporters are at fault because the DNC keeps promoting shitty candidates for office?  I used to think only Republicans applied this sort of logic, but here we are ..... again.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@QuinnMandell @ChicagoBears That is true.....  definitely tru-biski.......<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 I think your question is your answer.....  In less than 6 weeks we've had &gt; 40,000 deaths due to COVID-19.  It took 7 months to get 1,000 deaths from swine flu.

<|startoftext|>@cwarren2006 @saxisgirl @_ReaalAmerican_ @senatemajldr @NYGovCuomo My point is that just like we have people making them *now*, we could have started that process *earlier*.  Then we wouldn't have shortages and people dying due to lack of protection/equipment.    Also, what's with the name calling?  Grow up or give the computer back to mom &amp; dad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cwarren2006 @saxisgirl @_ReaalAmerican_ @senatemajldr @NYGovCuomo No, the point is *not* moot.  The administration knew of this issue at least as early as Jan.  They could have reached out to domestic suppliers to ramp up production, just like they did in ... MID-MARCH.    Stop making excuses for bad leadership.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cwarren2006 @saxisgirl @_ReaalAmerican_ @senatemajldr @NYGovCuomo Chris, I agree 100% that no one could have stopped it from getting here.  The point is that the WH was getting DAILY briefings in January (and possibly sooner)  They did *nothing* to marshall resources until Mid-March!  That is unacceptable and resulted in unnecessary deaths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adam4004 @LiveFromLiz @saxisgirl @_ReaalAmerican_ @senatemajldr The article is here:   https://t.co/CbiGP1YXUR  They do mention multiple sources confirming its existence *and* cover the denial.

<|startoftext|>@LiveFromLiz @Adam4004 @saxisgirl @_ReaalAmerican_ @senatemajldr @ABC and you really believe a random website full of advertisements and conspiracy theories... oh ... wait... nevermind, you probably do.  Carry on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiveFromLiz @Adam4004 @saxisgirl @_ReaalAmerican_ @senatemajldr So your 'retort' is to post an op-ed from a non-news source which provides no facts?  Interesting choice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@saxisgirl @_ReaalAmerican_ @senatemajldr You realize that Trump still has the support of nearly half of the country even after everything that has transpired as of late?

<|startoftext|>@_ReaalAmerican_ @senatemajldr Facts have no place here.  Trump, McConnell, et al., are much smarter than the rest of us.

<|startoftext|>@dbongino Way to take statements out of context.    Trump's statement was that the *cause* of the shortage in NY is due to theft.  Cuomo's comment is in regards to the claim that theft is the cause of the shortage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HKrassenstein Well in a way, Trump is right.  If Trump were competent and displaying proper leadership at the national level, Cuomo wouldn't be getting nearly as much attention for his professional handling of the situation at the state level.    $.02<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Reagan_Democrat @DrRobDavidson @realDonaldTrump @GovWhitmer I *agree* that the China ban was right.  Literally everything else after that was *wrong*, though.  I strongly believe that Trump thought it would never get here which is why we were so poorly prepared to handle it.  In fact, we shipped 18 tons of medical supplies *TO* China....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedHourBen Unfortunately for us Americans, corporations have taken control of media.  In the early 1980's, ~50 companies owned media and now that number in the single digits.

<|startoftext|>@Reagan_Democrat @DrRobDavidson @realDonaldTrump @GovWhitmer Ok - So we've been short since 2009 and it's all Obama's fault.  Ok, fine.

<|startoftext|>@Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump I wonder where the $ is going for texting TRUMP to that number?  Not a bad $ generating idea to say a bunch of conservative stuff, get retweeted by Trump, grow followers, and then cash in.  That demographic eats that stuff up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I have ZERO doubt that EVERYONE wants to get back to normal as quickly as possible.  With that said, we cannot panic and allow fear to enable us make bad decisions.    Follow CDC / Expert guidance, resist fear of the unknown, and American will be stronger than ever before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Raoulseyepatch @zack__attack69 @ESPNStatsInfo Cam *IS* a big guy, but I don't think he's on the DLine....     (Yeah yeah, I saw your other tweet, I'm still going to give you a little grief. :) :)  )<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zack__attack69 @Raoulseyepatch @ESPNStatsInfo Considering you are admittedly "defending" him against ESPNStats' post showing his "less than stellar stats" that seems to imply you think he is better; otherwise, you wouldn't need to "defend" him, right?    He is not, and will likely never be, the player that he was again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zack__attack69 @Raoulseyepatch @ESPNStatsInfo So you've switched back to defending Cam after just asking for facts or?  I'm confused.  Again, he did great, that one season and has been injured for most of the past 5 years.  You pay an elite athlete for what they can do going forward, not just what they did in the past.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@denise_dewald @DrDenaGrayson Unfortunately, the admin in Washington can't be bothered with science and data.  That's too boring.  We are basically living in Idiocracy:    https://t.co/mCUjUdJ89v<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benshapiro Our estimates of the risk for death in Wuhan reached values as high as 12% in the epicenter of the epidemic and ≈1% in other, more mildly affected areas. The elevated death risk estimates are probably associated with a breakdown of the healthcare system   https://t.co/WBfZg4OtWR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zack__attack69 @ESPNStatsInfo Considering you responded to a tweet providing a negative stat about Cam with "show all the facts", that probably implies you disagree.  If you agreed, why would want more facts shown that just reinforce the original point?    #HaveAShovelDigAHole<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zack__attack69 @ESPNStatsInfo And that helps your argument how exactly?  Who wants to sign an aging QB that has only had one complete season out of the last 5?    Cam's success came when he was most physical , not because of great accuracy or finesse.  Unfortunately, that came at a cost.  (longevity)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mcspocky I'm *NOT* a Trump fan, but it just looked like he was looking down.  I'm all for booting this guy in November, but make the argument justified, not sensationalized shit as that will find a way to blow back in your face later.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TankLawrence Father time, is that you??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OrphanAntoinet2 @DemoPat @Grandpa_Rufus @JoeBiden The arrogance displayed in your post (and by DNC) is why Trump was elected.  I did not vote for Hillary and it wasn't because of "a tantrum".  Votes are earned, not assumed by "right".  Hillary did not attract independent leaning voters, thus lost battleground states.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fieldviewsports Cam is not a serious upgrade.  Trubiski's weakness is passing accuracy.  He can't hit anyone 15+ yards and resorts to checking down.  Cam Newton is not an accurate passer either unless he is ... checking down   +Cam is older and has a closet full of injuries.  We're done here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fieldviewsports *YOU* started this discussion based on Cam's great COMP-% for *1* year where he was primarily checking down to receivers.    My argument, which has apparently escaped you, is that *NEITHER* of these two are accurate QBs (other than checkdowns) so it isn't an upgrade to get Cam...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fieldviewsports I am talking about completion % and that is relevant since that is Trubiski's biggest weakness....  How many times has he flat out missed open receivers 15+ yards, etc.    We don't need to replace him with another QB who has accuracy issues.    Anyway, we're going in circles...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fieldviewsports So your argument is that the *one* year Cam had a good passing rating, he "played like Mitch".    That isn't a good thing.  I think you are allowing your judgement to be clouded by Cam's glory days, which are long gone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jason It adds up.  China has lied since Day 1 about both scope &amp; severity of illness, so we really can't take them at face value.  Also, as they didn't contain it well, it already "burned through" their population.  Weak are already dead, remaining people get mild symptoms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fieldviewsports "All I've shown" is that he has worse accuracy than Trubiski and since that is one of the biggest problems with him, why would we pickup another inaccurate / inconsistent passer?   With that said, I"d be curious in accuracy on 15+ yard plays.  Trubiski does a lot of checkdowns..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fieldviewsports Seriously?  I guess this conversation is done if you don't understand / care to recognize trends and outliers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fieldviewsports Completion % / TD / INT by Year 2019- 56.2 % / 0 / 1  (obviously not a full year) 2018- 67.9 % / 24 / 13 2017- 59.1 % / 22 / 16  2016- 52.9 % / 19 / 14 2015- 59.8% / 35 / 10  2014- 58.5% / 18 / 12  2018 &amp; 67.9% is an outlier as far as we know....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fieldviewsports Narrative?  My narrative is for the Bears to get a good QB and win games.  Newton has been in decline and the injuries have taken a toll.  Completion % is my big issue.  Since that is a big issue with Trubiski, why go with someone worse?  (and Cam had better targets @ Panthers)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Patriots *NOT* a Patriots fan, but lots of respect for what Tom and the Patriots org. has accomplished over the years!  Still a bit surprised that he's moving on, but all good things must come to an end eventually.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fieldviewsports Cam Newton?  Cam Newton from 5+ years ago, maybe....  Present day Cam Newton would be like when the Cubs signed up Soriano....  lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BearsNationCHI If he can complete 15+ yard passes to wide-open receivers, I'm in.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@W00dsTiger @Panthers @ChicagoBears Hrm.......  Not sure how I feel about this.   I think we've already reached the upper limit of Trubiski's skill; therefore, a change would be good.    I'm not sure that Cam is an answer as he's regressed quite a bit and Trubiski shockingly has a higher pass completion rating...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realkatiejow You can be a carrier *WITHOUT* showing symptoms.  That's the problem.  You can seem and even be 100% "healthy" while passing it on to others who may not be a fortunate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realkatiejow Given your comments about COVID-19, I don't think you deserve to "stay in the race".   Why would any school district want someone in this role who doesn't understand the "big picture" and/or making "hard decisions".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BreitbartNews He's right.  I do feel Trump is finally starting to listen; however, for months he has done nothing but HURT this country's response to this epidemic.  We've known about this virus since December.    Why did it take "the greatest country in the world" until ~March 14th to act?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNNPolitics @CNNDebates   Can someone ask @JoeBiden why if we hate China so much, we allow literally every product to be sourced from there?  If we are so concerned about their policies, why are we not preventing business from dealing with them?    #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realkatiejow @AOC You have no business being anywhere near a school district given your brazen disregard for the welfare of others.  The CDC/experts aren't asking people to stay out of the public just for their own health, but for that of others.  A board member would know to put others first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Book_of_Cyril @Tzipshmil @BrookeGMcDonald @fly2ohare In this case, it kinda starts with Trump since he is in charge of this org.

<|startoftext|>@HardballChris @MSNBC Did you really imply that the U.S. would be better off with Trump than Sanders?  Have you not been paying attention the past ~4 years or are you getting paid by someone to say that?  I can't possibly believe that you would really actually believe that.    Ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@byJulianMack He actually said he had no issue with blowing the whistle, but his issue was with him doing so *AFTER* he got a ring....  (e.g. why not blow whistle immediately?)

<|startoftext|>Suggestion for @MLB - Home team's promotion item should be a min-plastic garbage can when Astros are in town.   How about it @Dodgers or maybe hometown @Cubs?

<|startoftext|>@PirozziH @hippyniki Sorry you feel that way, but you should really do some research.  The economy CRATERED right as he came into office due to prior budgets/tax cuts/housing crisis.

<|startoftext|>@jjervis78 @XFLNewsCom and that was for a reason.  If you can't fill the lower, there's no reason to open the upper.  All that would do is make the place look even emptier by scattering the people around more.    I'm not dogging them, it's the first week after all.  Guessing it will pick up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@XFLNewsCom This guy is an idiot, lol.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@XFLNewsCom I haven't followed this league much, but it seems the only player I know well is Matt McGloin....  He may have the honors of being the first player cut from the league as well.....  IF so, give him a trophy or something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@XFLNewsCom OK turnout, uppers are empty and some of lower section.  On the other hand, its Week 2, so ....  The real question:  How much are tickets for XFL games?  A decent NFL seat is &gt; $200 in my market......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xfl2020 @ABCNetwork I think a High School player could have intercepted that pass it was so bad.....  I love how the QB was ripping on the *team* at half-time when he was the one stinking up the place.    Love the real time post-bench interview... that is golden!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brianmctaggart Doesn't matter one bit.  If they knew about it and didn't do anything to stop it, they are complicit.  They still absolutely benefited from this....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SInow lol.....  @TeamCJCorrea - Trump can probably use you on his team with bad lying like that.....    Who was going to see it?  The team on the field?  Guess he hides in the locker room too, then....  Fans?  They aren't going to see that from any distance.. TV?  Nope....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brianmctaggart and how many games *before* Game 7 did the Astros *cheat* in?  Would the Astros have even been in the WS without cheating?    @TeamCJCorrea - Classy.....  #MLBCheatingScandal #houstonasterisks #Cheaters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeamCJCorrea -  Facts - @astros ( including you) *CHEATED*     Take your own advice and kindly STFU.    Your team doesn't deserve the 2017 WS Champion title nor should anyone on your team hold any honors from that year.    If others cheated, they should be reprimanded as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffPassan I agree 100%, @MLB  should step in to stop "premeditated" targeting.  They can do so by stripping the title from the @astros The only reason this is even a discussion topic is because MLB didn't adequately punish the team &amp; players...  #houstonasterisks #MLBCheatingScandal #MLB<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SuniDae @Delta I agree 100% with airlines needing to fix this.  One flight the seats were so close, I couldn't even sit down as my knees were into the seat in front....  I'm tall, but not ridiculously tall either.  (6' 4")<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuniDae @Delta To be fair, there's nothing wrong with being courteous.  If I had a dollar every time the person in front of me just slams their seat back, I'd be independently wealthy.  One time laptop screen was cracked, one time my knee got cut open, bunch of times knees just get slammed....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexia I've gotten blood clots while flying due to lack of leg room and one time someone slammed their seat back so forcefully/quickly my knee was pinched / cut open.  I try to upgrade but sometimes, you can't.  Don't assume everyone else doesn't have issues.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pedrogomezESPN @Dodgers @astros What a joke, @astros and @MLB.......   What makes it all even worse is finding out that teams knew about this *AND* reported it.  Great messages you are sending to youth players....  Astros should lose title/stats for cheating years ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_SJPeace_ He didn't start "taking knees" until after he got benched due to bad QB play......  The real reason why he hasn't signed with a NFL, CFL, XFL, or any other league is that he *DOESN'T WANT* to actually play.  He just wants to play the martyr card and collect piles of cash....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WayneDupreeShow Say what?  How exactly did this clown bring the NFL to its knees.  They are doing just fine without him....  No room for drama players.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theblaze He has no intention of REALLY playing football in the XFL, CFL, or even NFL.  The second he puts on cleats he will be exposed for being a sub-part quarterback.  Better to keep milking the martyr myth......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnFugelsang Offended by Trump.  Kapernick is still an idiot.  Actually, he is smart.  He took what was a failing QB career and turned himself into a martyr allowing him to profit from book deals, interviews, shoe deals, etc.  This clown has no intention of REALLY trying to play FB again....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nessnitty This was that guy who after having very bad QB stats, got benched, and then started protests?  Same guy that then blew off a few offers from teams as well as a tryout day put on by the NFL?  Not sure why so much drama with FB players....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBCNews Actually, he had a contract and opted out.  Then he asked a ridiculous amount of money given his sub-par statistics.  When given a tryout by NFL, he cancelled at the last minute only to put on a "private" event.  Can we please stop this myth of him being a great QB?  He isn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@espn Is this the story where a mediocre quarter has a good season due to awesome teammates, then craters, gets benched, and then decides to protest.  Then after passing on multiple offers he claims NFL is "keeping him out"?  Gets tryout and cancels @ last minute?    #Yawn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lloydblankfein @msuster This is probably the dumbest thing I've read in quite some time.

<|startoftext|>@fradarl29 @Eviljohna @chosenlyric The DNC's pre-anointment of a candidate (Clinton) who *could not* connect with **REGULAR PEOPLE** cost the Democratic party multiple battleground states.

<|startoftext|>@LindaKWS1 @Eviljohna Bernie or Bust / Putin supporters?  What?  You guys are nuts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Burkmc In other words, some people lack comprehension and won't learn.  The DNC is at risk of repeating its prior mistake of trying to force pre-chosen candidates.

<|startoftext|>USC case (Nixon v. US) upheld stance that Senate impeachment trial has standards.

Why didn't they ask Roberts this during Q&amp;A?  #ImpeachTrump #ImpeachmentTrial<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarkillersAlly But when you literally have a Skywalker who has went through a redemption arc *and* the movie is called "The Rise of Skywalker", its a rather odd choice to kill them off... But hey, that's just me, lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSCloud Any chance you can help with the #ImpeachmentTrials  ?  Seems we have a bunch of Senators who don't understand their constitutional obligations.  Any chance we could use some of that #AI to enforce impartiality?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonGATX This is probably the stupidest argument that I keep hearing.  Sounds like something you'd hear on Fox News and repeat without thinking.  I'd argue to explain why this is so ridiculously wrong, but it would obviously be a waste of time.  This response was even a waste of time....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarkillersAlly What you don't like a newb with no training of any sort be a master builder, space pilot, space gunner, jedi mind master, jedi fight master, and take over the skywalker name even though she's a palpatine who did nothing to earn her place in the universe other than show up?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CarmineSabia Victory?  How exactly is this "victory"?  The Senate's *Constitutional Responsibility* is to try the President on the House's charge(s) to reach a guilty/not-guilty verdict.

<|startoftext|>@GerardEzinwoke @AlanDersh @Harvard So now you're transitioning to ad hominem..... Classy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GerardEzinwoke @AlanDersh @Harvard A Legal counter argument would imply there was a legal argument to start with.  We can start with that.  :)  But.... When I'll sitting at the airport later, I'll provide clarification to some of what I took issue with (and why)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlanDersh  - "We can't impeach, it's too hard, and people won't like it....  Instead vote him out in 8 months"  a) Right isn't always easy and that isn't an excuse b) Isn't this impeachment about him compromising elections?  P.S. Nixon resigned, not relevant  #ImpeachmentTrial<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow.... @JaySekulow  - The framework gives the Senate the right to set their own rules which could easily allow for the Chief Justice to make those decisions.  In regards to your reference to other trials, trials allow witnesses / evidence on a regular basis... #ImpeachmentTrial<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ummmmmmm....... @RepJeffries  At no point did you answer Senator Collins' question????  I support impeachment, but when you go up there and speak for your entire allotted time and don't actually answer the question, you aren't helping your argument.....  #ImpeachmentTrial<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rhondawfleming1 Yes, to see how to make bad arguments while sounding knowledgeable......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GerardEzinwoke @AlanDersh I'm sorry you feel that way.  Used to respect this guy but after tuning into the last hour of Q&amp;A....  I don't have a law degree and even I know he's way off base at best and being intentionally dishonest at worst.  @Harvard should reconsider their relationship with this guy...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daunteburks @Harvard Agree 100%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MonicaNocciola @AlanDersh @Harvard I could not agree more.  He literally just said that a Presidential impeachment is far more important than a judicial one yet he argues we don't need witnesses?  For an "expert" trial lawyer to argue you don't need witnesses in the most important trial? Seems rather disingenuous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlanDersh  argues that:  Presidential impeachment proceedings are far more important/serious than judicial impeachments while arguing for no witnesses? What?   #ImpeachmentTrial<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>House Manager who answered the Trump due process question in House inquiry did a bad job of answering.  They should have presented a DETAILED list of all of the dates/communications/etc.  Instead was a vague-ish answer.  #ImpeachmentTrial<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People need to file complaints on this Pat Cipollone "lawyer".  Just now during Senate Q&amp;A he has propagated numerous false statements.

<|startoftext|>@virgoascending @Dartagnanmagic @JeromeJT3 @colintrevorrow I'm just saying they did a shit job with the sequel trilogy, I'm not losing any sleep over this.  This is Twitter, it takes about 5 seconds to make a post and get something off your chest...  Disney also isn't taking a multi-billion $ movie franchise very seriously either.. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@virgoascending @JeromeJT3 @colintrevorrow 2/2 - Those "continuity changes" were *not* perceptible to the audience, those were changes during filming/writing.  The final movies did not contradict prior work.    The changes in sequels (TLJ &amp; RoS) clearly broke the story arcs that the audiences knew.    Major difference<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@virgoascending @JeromeJT3 @colintrevorrow Yes, those changes were made ~43 years ago......  Since those movies came out and established *cannon*, there have been books, cartoons, prequel movies, etc., that all reinforced the story from the originals.  The new sequels destroyed all of that even when it didn't have to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DominantCub72 @DRMovieNews1 You loved The Rise of Palpatine??!?!?!?!?!?!?  Ummmm wow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@virgoascending @JeromeJT3 @colintrevorrow Actually there *was* ~42 years of continuity, no clue what you are talking about?  Cheesy dialogue?  Absolutely.  Overly used/abused CGI?  Definitely. (prequels)  I'd rather have that than crap that just is wildly inconsistent.  (e.g. Emperor ! dead, SuperTecmo Female Jedi, etc.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MLB &amp; @MLB_PLAYERS   So.... your response to the sign stealing scandal perpetrated by players was to give them immunity while hanging out the manager/GM out to dry?    That will really send a strong message to prevent future cheating.......  #WTF #MLBCheatingScandal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skorusARK I have the same issue with this as I have with Volvo claiming they have the safest cars.  There are so many variables that it is difficult to simply say it is autopilot/cars.  That is an oversimplificaiton.  NOTE - I own a '14 Tesla w/ AP, so I'm not a "hater"...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@joelpollak @RepAdamSchiff Could you be more specific about what part was deceptively edited?  Trump clearly said people should testify.

<|startoftext|>@kkazich @The_Dream99 I've been a Cubs fan long enough to know how Chicago sports can clutch failure from the jaws of victory, lol.

<|startoftext|>@GVennarucci91 @The_Dream99 I'd take Brady OR Manning.  Either could hopefully help mentor/train Trubiski while putting in a couple serviceable years.  I'd take Brady over Manning, but both are far better than what we have and would have a big chip on their shoulders.  Might even help Mitch in long run.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goblin9 @The_Dream99 What, you don't like watching balls continually sail over people's heads by +10 yards all season?  Who knows, maybe some preseason practice could have helped to figure out that route timing?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AndrewTLibby1 @Tslammer4000 @The_Dream99 I agree 100% it wasn't all on Mitch, but the guy can't make throws.  Open receivers downfield = 10 yard overthrows / or doesn't see them.  2018 = Lucky/Caught a lot of breaks b4 the "double-doink"  2019 = We didn't get those breaks &amp; QB talent not good enough to compensate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SarahSpain Watching Mahomes during the playoffs depresses me when I think about what we ended up with in CHI....  Mitch is a nice enough guy, but he's nowhere near Mahomes.

<|startoftext|>@AngelicDeby @tedlieu @DevinNunes Yeah, you're right.  It seems a lot of "conservatives" fall back to legal bullying tactics when their lies get called out.

<|startoftext|>As a lifelong fan of baseball, shame on @astros **players** and mgmt.  Millions of youth players look up &amp; emulate their stars.

<|startoftext|>@legant66 @NextLAMayor @Kaepernick7 Actually, no, he did attack the argument.

<|startoftext|>@cmclymer I'm not sure who these "fanboys" are that you are referring to; however, I know plenty of people who were around for the original movies that simply want stories that don't ruin the ~42 years of plot/character development.    They are not mutually exclusive desires..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KennyChilders97 GoT was different as the show didn't have any material to work with, the last couple of seasons.  The failure of Disney to put together credible storylines for this last trilogy is unforgivable due to books,movies,comics,THE CREATOR'S ignored advice... You may want to buck up...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesPrescott77 NO ONE has a problem with a strong female lead, but when that character hasn't development/earned anything &amp; just magically beats everyone, it is wrong.     With all of the content in the SW universe I don't understand how fuck this up this trilogy so badly. #BlameTheFansInstead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ConnorBehrens Definitely difficult, but here's a suggestion - Don't bring back old characters that invalidate everything that was fought for/"earned" in the prior 40+ years of story telling.    The SW universe is huge, plenty of new avenues so confused how they can fuck up so bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danielleradford Normally, I'd agree, but ... I think they are trying to spare people from paying / sitting through a train wreck.  To quote Han Solo:  "All of it (spoilers) are real.... All of it....."  I'm just amazed that with amount of $ / resources available to Disney they fucked it up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MauLer93 The "deep theme" is that the entire trilogy series has been about Anakin Skywalker bringing balance to the force.  This was accomplished by killing the Emperor / saving (Luke).      If the Emperor didn't die then.. none of the other movies mattered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OdinsMovieBlog I'm going to barf....  Definitely not watching this in the theater....  Lets see.. how else could they fuck this movie up... Oh, let me guess.. Rey single handedly beats the Emperor....   #SorryGeorgeLucas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kendalsnowflake The whole new trilogy is nothing but pandering to different demographics solely to fill the seats... (e.g. Unbeatable female characters w/ no development/failures, etc.)  TLJ - was hated for *breaking* established plot ToS - apparently has the same failure<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@heartbenprince The ot was actually sufficient enough, but ... it's not like Lucas was consulted *and ignored* I'm sure he could have educated them on something that at least would have been consistent with plenty of room for creative direction..... What a shit show.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anarchosorcerer Sadly I have to agree.  When I was younger I was dying for movies, but after seeing the heaping mess that was the *Disney* movies, I'd rather have ended things with RotJ.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Prismatic85 It isn't "being a fanboy" to point out that shitty decision after shitty decision ultimately destroyed ~42 years of well thought out, though not always well executed, story telling.  If you want to view movie in a movie vacuum "ok", but this plot wrecked the premise of the series<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NattyD13 it's literally everywhere... Emperor is Alive.. There.. I said it for you...  JJ would have been better served to start Rise of Skywalker with Kylo getting out of the shower and talking about what a shitty dream he had....  Seriously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@geekygirl1989 I don't think he would want JJ to fail because that means Star Wars failed, regardless of the fact it was "on" Disney.  This is probably going to wreck him more than it succeeding as he'll always hate himself for selling out &amp; wrecking 40+ years of work.  #HugeRegret<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LeoCTweets I got it. I got it. Hear me out. @jjabrams  also did some Star Trek, right?  He borrowed a cloaked Klingon ship which was orbiting the Death Star.

<|startoftext|>@LeoCTweets April First, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeoCTweets @rianjohnson 99.9% sure @jjabrams just madlib'd that shit *after* rian unexpected killed Snoke.

<|startoftext|>@fangirlcantina @LeoCTweets You're joking, right?  The character who "magically" learns everything and loses no fights while every other character had to "work" / develop?  Did she actually have to earn something in TROS unlike the other films?    #SmallViolin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeoCTweets @jjabrams - Seriously? I know @rianjohnson gave you a shit sandwich by killing Snoke off, but that ruins all of the other movies!  I guess if you live in a vacuum and act like the other 6 moves didn't already exist, or the books, or the comics, or the guy that created it all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarWarsINTRVWS @LeoCTweets That sucks, but agree completely about the Emperor... If only these guys had source material or people they could bounce ideas off of to see if they make sense in the SW universe.... too bad there nothing for them......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CommanderAppo2 Not really... there's probably only 130 or so people that liked The Last Jedi and most of them are @ Lucasfilm or shills for them.....  This whole trilogy has been a clusterf*ck though.  They should have used George's vision and just made it with ... good dialogue...  *sigh*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeoCTweets Look man, they were flying blind here.  There was no source material or anything.  Just pure gut feelings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SassyMamainLA Justice for Rian Johnson?  The guy that ruined Luke Skywalker's character and brought such innovations as: hyperspacing through ships, 1 MPH WWII "space bombers", and a bunch of scenes that had no bearing on plot/character development?  Yeah... I'm good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikeryan So in other words, the original trilogy?  None of the current trilogy has done anything to develop characters.  Rey=No Training/Beats Everyone, Finn? Poe?

<|startoftext|>@davidlsims Not at all.  But Luke acting like a grumpy old man hiding in a hut who debated murdering a relative isn't even close to his character at all.  Whoever wrote that version either: didn't like Luke/Mark Hamill, was ignorant to SW universe, or both.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidlsims Actually EP 7 implied Luke was searching for something of importance, not that he was "retired in shame".

<|startoftext|>@lamachine21 @ctcoff99 @GenieBaseball I think we all get what they are thinking, but ..... who gives up a 100% known quantity (e.g. 2016 WS win is in the books) to take a gamble, especially when you're talking about the Cubs.    They barely won that WS as it was, though I blame most of that on Maddon ironically...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KurtisJEvans @GenieBaseball Still no.  Give up 100% guaranteed WS vs. an unknown outcome?  (and don't forget this is the Cubs... and that genie's like to give you want you want, but in a trickster way with unintended consequences.... :)  )<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GenieBaseball There is no realm of reality where you tear up a known World Series victory in order to get a healthy player which in no way guarantees a WS victory...

<|startoftext|>@IWPCHI @BonaireVolt @elonmusk I don't think so.  It looks like that after the door pops open, the window drops which is SoP for the other Teslas.  Think its real glass mounted "for real", just the door was somewhat open allowing window to flex and not break.  After the ball hits, door pops open &amp; window drops<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BonaireVolt @elonmusk The more I think about this, the more I think this video was filmed **AFTER** the demo.  That is why the window suction cup is still on the rear door, etc.  They probably swapped out the glass and kept trying until one didn't break?    #ImNotParanoidJustEveryoneAfterMe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elonmusk Perhaps these were successfully since the window partially down and not solidly against door frame allowing for some give?  (unlike stage demo)  Or perhaps the first couple steel ball tests damaged the glass?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lucasc0102 @tesla4k @elonmusk It does have *some* to do with power,  but yes a lot of other variables.  Rims/tires look smaller on Ford.

<|startoftext|>@KarliBell33 Like everything else this season, the decision to pull him at 3 minutes left in 4th is quite confusing.  Chase isn't going to work a miracle w/ 3 min, should have just left him in and bench for rest of season.  And then to imply he was injured?  WTF.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeSilver @Kaepernick7 Why?  So we can replace one bad quarterback with another one?  Is it because the "new" one comes with large doses of drama?  While that might help distract from the poor play, it isn't going to win any games.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aarontor @thekapman  https://t.co/Edk9lz9esd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@conlon_penny @thekapman @obvious_shirts A LOT.  That guy is nothing but a walking drama storm.  Did you see the shit show he turned his "workout day" into?  The last thing Chicago needs is more ways to screw up team dynamics.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@stephenasmith I'm sure this will come up at Thanksgiving dinner.  :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stephenasmith @E_Reid35 I don't use Twitter much, but curious if this is common now?  (e.g. posting a photo with a lengthy response to get around Twitter text limits)  #Creative<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stephenasmith There's a lot of things you say that I don't agree with you on; however, I agree 100% on this.  The reality is his play was poor before the whole "controversy" started and he has no real desire to play again. It would expose him. Better to be a valiant legend / myth than a bad QB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@techweenie @atrupar Listen, you know those liberal, boring, nerds, made a time machine, but Biff Tannen... errr Donald stole to go back and take over...  Beginning to think 'Back to the Future' is a documentary on Trump, lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar It literally blows my mind to think that ~ 50% of the U.S. population will believe this line of bullshit.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nessnitty @msuster More drama, seriously?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eartha1969 @ErickFernandez @NFL   Eartha1969 - "I don't care.  I don't pay attention to gaslighters."  Stating facts doesn't make you a gaslighter, refusing to look at/listen to facts while spewing unsubstantiated BS, makes *you* the gaslighter, though.  #HypocrisyMuch?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eartha1969 @ErickFernandez @NFL @Eartha1969 apparently couldn't handle reality and blocked me claiming I'm gaslighting, ha ha.  I posted actual statistics and news articles demonstrating a position while she sticks her fingers in ears and hums.... Another "victim" I guess.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eartha1969 @ErickFernandez   @NFL   More "reality"  Kap *opts out* of his contract    https://t.co/xY4vNyYzeg  He thought he'd get more $ in FA, but his poor performance, high pay expectation, and drama factor resulted in no offers......<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Eartha1969 @ErickFernandez @NFL The number of Twitter followers I have has nothing to do with football / bad QB statistics; however, it is obvious that you don't have a grasp on facts so I shouldn't be surprised by that comment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jrichlive If you buy some of those trailcams, you can catch them sneaking through the forest looking for snacks/treats on occasion, though.  :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SportsCenter @msuster Was that like a 9 step drop?  Also what happened to the NFL coordinated event? I thought it was w/ Atlanta Falcons?  This looks like some random high school?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Orangerfans @ErickFernandez @Godswarrior1993 No, no he shouldn't.  Why?  Because he can't do even the simplest of things without creating a bunch of self-serving drama.  No **TEAM** needs that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eartha1969 @ErickFernandez @NFL I don't know what you people are smoking, but actually look at his stats for the last two seasons.  Also realize he was benched **BEFORE** any of this kneeling non-sense started.   He was only good the first couple seasons because the team carried **HIM**<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zzzzzacurry @ErickFernandez You know he had a *guaranteed* contract through the 2020 season, right?  He *voluntarily left* in the delusion that he was going to make a killing in FA.   When your QBR is in the 30's and your team is in way last place, no one is going to throw money at you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ErickFernandez This guy is such an idiot.  NFL gave him a shot in front of NFL teams today and instead, he demanded last minute changes to the format and then made up his own event while slamming the NFL?  Clear that he really has no intent of playing in NFL and just wants to create drama....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ErickFernandez Well he looked better than Trubiski; however, his drama will ensure he doesn't land a spot in the NFL.  Nice of him to invent last minute drama for this day.  I honestly have no clue why the NFL even offered in the first place, this bizarre outcome wasn't a surprise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FOX5Sports What a shit show.  This "drama" only demonstrates why he isn't in the league.  Even **if** you are the most talented guy out there, if you do nothing but create drama you won't have much success.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamSchefter @msuster I guess it isn't his arm that resulted in the benchings and the YoY decling QBR.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Brewers Because ... someone did better than him.  Just because someone did better than their last year, doesn't mean another player cannot outperform them.  Your analytics department can probably explain this one to you guys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jiggs44 @TOOTBLANTime @BleacherNation As a Cubs fan, no I didn't forget about Sammy roiding it up with Mark McGuire.....  I didn't approve of that and I wouldn't approve of sign stealing.   Also MLB is probably going to block any Sosa / McGuire HoF elections so no, no one forgot....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mgds005 @Angrydoc24 @BleacherNation Pitching was far worse on the road.  Perhaps partly due to people stealing signals?  It's not like we had players batting 20:1 home/away, that is something worth investigating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BleacherNation Does this make @ChristianYelich the league's MVC ("Most Valuable Cheater")<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jessica_smetana or did they?  :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@some_fake_name It's funny you posted this as I would envisioning this today when the one rep. offered for Trump to take a seat.  I could totally see him shout out .... "You're damn right I ordered the code red.... "<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeTalkShow @Jim_Jordan If he's your voice, I'm sorry.....  All the guy did was yell and interrupt the panel before they could even answer the questions he was asking.  (when he was asking questions and not insinuating some theory/rumor)  #ImpeachmentHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pgold1230 @girlsreallyrule This is perfect. I knew I recognized his behavior from somewhere.  Anytime he feels threatened, he tries to front strength, just like my little dog.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SoozieCuzie The funniest part was during the break one of the other Republicans was talking to reporters and when asked about Jim Jordan he said, "yes, he's great.  He is very good with his words and that is why he's here"  Wait.... what?  :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SistaCitizen Didn't realize he was 5th in a class at West Point and *volunteered* to do infantry in **VIETNAM**  A little surprised he didn't literally smack him down, but ... he is a professional unlike some of the clowns asking questions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoaquinCastrotx   #ImpeachmentHearings  FYI -  "The State Department decision, which hasn’t been reported previously, stemmed from a legal finding ... the president, had no legal standing to block spending of the Ukraine aid."   https://t.co/vmqKYpX448  #DoYourHomework<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ImpeachmentHearings   Why has no one mentioned the fact that the aid was restored because the WH was notified that they had no legal standing to withhold it?  And why are we talking about Obama?    #Confused<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ImpeachmentHearings  Just listening to one of the Rep. during the break and he continually avoided answering questions/offering unrelated crap.  Not one reporter called him out for not answering the question and/or for offering unrelated info.  They just let him ramble on?  Why?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BearsNationCHI Four score and seven years ago ......  In other news KC came from behind against Minnesota today 26-23 with a backup quarterback who had been coaching HS football for the past two years.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Josh_Frydman Yeah, this was 100% Grade A bullshit.  As bad as the Bears played, this was ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoodyKyrie and in other news, KC comes from behind with a backup QB who wasn't even in the NFL the past couple of years.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaxMarkhamNFL @jhansen_op6 Wait?  What?  Why?  He's the genius that brought us Matt Nagy *and* traded up for Trubiski.  Yes, Mack is a great acquisition, but Mack was already an established presence and the Raiders were stupid to let him go........<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaxMarkhamNFL KC put up 26 points (and won) today with a backup quarterback who was coaching high school football for the past couple years before he got called by the coach right before the season starts.  Crazy stuff......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@teddybrunson P.S.  Looks like Jordan Howard is having a bad day..... *NOT*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SethAbramson @msuster Kinda like when people look back on Nazi Germany and wonder how anyone would have let that happen, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joehill187 @sdrobert12 @AaronLemingNFL You must watch different games than the rest of us.  This isn't about "Hall of Fame" caliber, this is about simply making normal passes, reading defense, etc.  Today 1 first down / ~1 yd of offense in 1st half.  Last week blew the game with INT/Fumble...  FFS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joehill187 @AaronLemingNFL What's with the victim mentality?  Trubisky had no place being drafted as high as he was and he's done nothing since to justify it.    I will agree that I wonder if better coaching would have helped him develop, but to blame the media and fans is idiotic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@teddybrunson I strolled in and caught the game around the ~2 min warning of the first half.  Saw the Bears had 0 first downs and ~1 yard of offense...  Wow..  I also saw a couple of BS penalties against them and a non-call OPI against Fuller, so insult to injury!  Does Chase start 2nd half?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ironhead17 @pourmecoffee @IvankaTrump I guess they have already legalized drugs where you live?  lol.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RepMattGaetz Since you seem very concerned about having all of the evidence available for all, when can we expect you to storm the DoJ to get full release of the Mueller report / investigation?  As that info is already directly related to this situation, I assume you will fight for that also?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@msuster Honest question, but what is the value in a fractional ownership of a baseball card?  Investment or sentimental?  Do you actually get to hold onto / see this thing for any amount of time?  Not criticizing, but probably better investment choices?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HollywoodDGirl @AB84 @NFL @NFLPA ?  @Raiders - He skipped out of the whole preseason, got into a fight with the GM, and demanded his release, to which he exclaimed on SM "Freedom!"

<|startoftext|>@HollywoodDGirl @AB84 @NFL @NFLPA AB is definitely not the first, nor the last.  As we've seen here, "guaranteed money", isn't 100% absolutely guaranteed.

<|startoftext|>@Markit_Zero @Cubs As much as I blame Joe for nearly costing the Cubs the World Series in game 7, this season is *hardly* Joe's fault.  Literally everyone knew last season that the Cubs had major relief/closer issues and the front office did *NOTHING* to address it...  (that is just 1 example)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulZeise To be fair, the legal stuff didn't come out until *AFTER* they signed him.  Also, given they cut him today, they obviously didn't want to have any ties to the guy once they knew.  For that matter, he may have got cut after this interview since Coach doesn't like drama....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricCReynolds @AB84 This deserves about a 1,000,000 likes.  I think the issue, though, is he is so delusional/has a mental issue and honestly doesn't realize he's screwed up.

<|startoftext|>@drewg03 @E_Reid35 @roybelly Kaep didn't sacrifice shit.  He had a contract through 2020 and opted out in search of more money.  Additionally his performance dropped every year and QBR was in the 40's...  He then turned down an offer as he wanted more $ than Tom Brady makes...  That's greed, not sacrifice.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_Teezy_216 @HarleenQuinchel @E_Reid35 and part of a football player's job (as most other jobs) is ... not pissing off your company's customers.

<|startoftext|>@LSChiefsFan58 At no point did I imply you need to poll the world before making any decision.    My seemingly simple point was that you can't use *one* person to represent a much larger set of people.  Feel free to continue misconstruing that, though...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bamdixon @LSChiefsFan58 @ErinNeelyLopez @Kaepernick7 @E_Reid35 @KSTiLLS @iThinkIsee12 Did you conduct a survey to determine that or is it your opinion?  I don't know if the majority are or are not, I'm not making that assumption.  Asking "one" guy doesn't cut it though.  General population polling shows they are generally viewed unfavorably, though.

<|startoftext|>@ffflygirl @Kaepernick7 @E_Reid35 @KSTiLLS @iThinkIsee12 Isn't JayZ performing a service and getting paid?  Once again, seems a bit hypocritical to slam a guy for "working with" the NFL while .... "working with" the NFL.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Mandy_hive @Kaepernick7 @E_Reid35 @KSTiLLS @iThinkIsee12 Only "silencing" the ones with subpar performance who opted out of their contracts through 2020 in search of a bigger paycheck, who also turned down offers from two other teams since "they" wanted $20M a year.

<|startoftext|>@CJ_FromTheBay @jacobcthompson1 @Kaepernick7 He only really was good the first couple of seasons when surrounded by talent.

<|startoftext|>@Proudmac1 @Kaepernick7 I guess you don't follow football?  His QB ratings declined every year and he was benched multiple times the last couple years.

<|startoftext|>@jacobcthompson1 @Kaepernick7 His stats say otherwise.  While his first couple years were good, he declined essentially every year.

<|startoftext|>@bitch_hoggle @gjbgjj @emilynussbaum I'm not asking women to "remain silent", but why shit all over someone's award moment?    The nominees didn't do anything wrong.
