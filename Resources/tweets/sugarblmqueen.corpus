<|startoftext|>@Guayaki is a terrible company that she no longer be supported. their drinks are terrible and the way that they’ve used the plant name as their label as made so many ppl think it was the name of the company. if you enjoy drink yerba mate instead go to the latin market n support<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#NewProfilePic  https://t.co/WSDHQfWOeV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnceriangoddess @ny_ocho it’s working somewhat effectively actually but it’s just the fact that some ppl don’t care or see themselves as being above it all sadly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madybeerluv you want to be able to share your partner that brings you happiness and joy with your mom or simply bring them back to your space that you call home w/ your mom seeing it as you seeking attention ☆彡 i’m hoping that with time it’ll get better and she’ll truly understand<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ny_ocho @MadiganEmily i understand through someone else educating me that sage was also used by enslaved black ppl for their healing 💓 i feel as sage is very much over marketed and i think that all natural healers that use it for their ancient rituals should be the only ones using it 🌟<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@keonxblue thank your for educating me on the fact that enslaved black ppl also used sage in their healing ! i still think that sage should be only be used by the natural healers that need it for their healing rituals and that it’s being over marketed :/ they should be the only 1s using it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>not someone trying to black mail me 😃 whoops wrong person ! try again nxt time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@msgorillagrip @ny_ocho @MadiganEmily i’m not completely sure but i would stay away from sage in general since they’re usually marketed together ! hopefully someone indigenous sees this and can voice their opinions 🦋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>pls remember that white sage is meant to only be used by indigenous ppl !! it’s heavily marketed which is making it hard for these communities that use it in their rituals :/  take time to research yourself instead of following big creators :-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ny_ocho @MadiganEmily hi :-) ik you have good intentions but pls aware that white sage is meant to only be used by indigenous ppl !! it’s heavily marketed which is making it hard for these communities that use it in their rituals :/ consider switching and using different herbs like lavender! :-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@noahmarkell @ny_ocho white sage(in pic)  is only for indigenous ppl use ! you should try using lavender or maybe other herbs instead :-)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@616BROOKLYN @sza i never said she doesn’t have every right to get it deleted but there are more appropriate ways of doing so !! THE DMS ARE OPEN!
