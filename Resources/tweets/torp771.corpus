<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 Readmitting Derek Hatton might cost a few more votes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 Possibly some perspective needed here....we are still headed to a Brexit fuelled catastrophe. Forget these 7 MPs and form a coherent plan that will be embraced by the voting public or heed the views of party members re 2nd referendum @paulmasonnews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmasonnews Luckily no Labour MPs have said anything offensive, racist or otherwise, as it would have been investigated with due diligence and impartiality and acted upon with results published. Do you see why members are leaving??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 More than has been spent by Labour on tackling anti semitism I‚Äôm sure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenJones84 @TomRtweets Unfortunately when you remove the rose tinted glasses you‚Äôll see the current Labour leadership for what is. It looks like all those new members (Tories) who voted Corbyn will have achieved their aim of destroying a once great party<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jamesldowns @bbcsesh @samaritans Thank you James for your incredibly powerful video. As someone who‚Äôs been in your position I recognise what you‚Äôre saying and being able to reach out and having support available is so key. Thank you for speaking up.<|endoftext|>
