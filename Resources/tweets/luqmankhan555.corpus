<|startoftext|>In my opinion, hurt feeling claim in Luise Regan case was not sufficient justification to breach the Law in Article 10 in Human Rights Act and page 27 of EHRC report. Ms Regan suspension is Breach of contract by @UKLabour @Keir_Starmer  https://t.co/2smtTxZfpi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Suspend @Keir_Starmer for hurting FEELINGS of LEFT wing Jews given that hurting someone's FEELINGS is not an unconditional reason for suspension.

<|startoftext|>Why?  What can we do?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To my knowledge, @Keir_Starmer doesn't condemn Israel for illegal occupation and settlements or Racist Apartheid and has not demanded Israel return to pre 1967 borders.  UK Muslim voters must remind themselves regularly during the Council and Mayoral elections in 2021.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer 's @UKLabour issuing Suspensions threat to stop members discussing @EHRC report is Racist and Islamophobic because the EHRC failure to report on the FAKE antisemitism complaints the SMEARED HATE CRIME towards Muslims.  https://t.co/Bjn8BblV5i<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer gagging order on @EHRC report stops me Muslim to seek help from CLPs to pass motions on EHRC report failure to examine FAKE antisemitism complaints to Smear Hate Crime against Muslim. That is my Islamophobia complaint against you Starmer.  https://t.co/Z2X5FrAQH6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me Muslim - Why have you @Keir_Starmer not suspended Luke Akehurst after alleged Isslamophobia complaint against him.  You accepted of 'all' LMN Labour Islamophobia report Akehurst facing Islamophobia complaint of anti-Palestinian racism -  https://t.co/u8MImEbFl9  via @skwawkbox<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Over half (55%) Muslim Labour members 'do not trust party to tackle Islamophobia' @Keir_Starmer has focused all his priority on antisemitism.  @Keir_Starmer has treated Muslims as second class.  https://t.co/SraI7kGBLO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This CLP has no confidence in @Keir_Starmer because allegedly he is racially discriminating against Black and Asian by using more #LabourParty resources dealing with antisemitism than Racism and Islamophobia against Black and Asian people and Muslims.  https://t.co/7CfxQzfZ3N<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In my opinion @Keir_Starmer is conducting Race Discrimination against Black and Asians and Muslim people like me. Don't add to that Race Discrimination by doing anything which will give credit to Keir Starmer.  Pass the attached motion at CLPs  https://t.co/rjNeSVzQM6<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer ignores Socialist Jews and so Starmer HURTS the Socialist Jews Feelings.  That is Starmer's antisemitism towards Socialist Jews, which is something Starmer is not concerned about in my opinion.  https://t.co/4nUJd174My<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Dear @Keir_Starmer according to EHRC report pg 27  people can make legitimate Criticism of Israel.

<|startoftext|>@EHRC Report didn't examined FAKE Antisemitism complaints against Muslims.  @Keir_Starmer and Evans are allegedly threatening to discipline people if they want CLPs to discuss EHRC Report.

<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer has been told that @UKLabour Party FAILURES identified in the @EHRC report also exactly apply to Racism and Islamophobia in the Labour Party.  Starmer's refusal to deal with it at the same time as antisemitism will be Racism and Islamophobia by Labour Party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EHRC report into @UKLabour Party is ambiguous and its findings deeply flawed, vague and inconsistent.  It concluded only two unlawful acts by two Labour Party “agents”. So much for the five years news headlines.  https://t.co/9PJpZyP1Bo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When pollsters asked the British public what share of Labour members faced complaints of antisemitism, the average guess was 34 percent.  That's over 200,000 members the public perceive to be Antisemites.  https://t.co/IsSewLPv3h<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer is FAILING to take action to deal with Racism and Islamophobia in the @UKLabour Party.

<|startoftext|>In my opinion @Keir_Starmer 's @UKLabour General Secretary Instructions NOT discuss EHRC Report and Corbyn's Suspension is RACIST, ISLAMOPHOBIC and ANTISEMITIC and also those who implement the instructions are guilty of the same. Detail in URL   https://t.co/QZBmKW5V65<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Antisemitic, Racist and Islamophobic thing about EHRC Report is NOT what is in the Report but what is ABSENTS from the Report.  So the EHRC Report is not good enough to be accepted.  See Email to @Keir_Starmer in URL    https://t.co/QZBmKW5V65<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Corbyn is suspended without telling him, which Rule he has broken.  @EHRC Report states that accused must be told what Rule they have broken.  Labour will waste my money through abuse of process in my opinion. So the AGENT who suspended Corbyn must pay the Legal costs them self.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>A Daily REMINDER to @Keir_Starmer of Labour Party. It is Antisemitism to collectively equate Jewish people to Israel State.  As is, it is Antisemitism to blame Jews collectively for the actions of Israel State.   https://t.co/xouPcZL7LB via @skwawkbox  https://t.co/hqXiyMinJo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So is it to be Starmer's THIRD WAY all over again Like BLAIR.  Is Labour Party to further the interest of the FEW and the MANY?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Allegedly Labour Party Hard Right Wing are  comfortable with @Keir_Starmer not voting against legislation that would allow the State to have individuals murdered or raped without any judicial oversight/division of powers.<|endoftext|>
