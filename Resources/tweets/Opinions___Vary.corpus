<|startoftext|>@palmsolo Read your Black Friday Phone article. Google Fi has a deal on Note 20 Ultra with $500 off.  Just fyi. Great day to you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marklevinshow Saw that. Why were you so nice about it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dagenmcdowell That is amazing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a break from all the noise about November 3, 2020 I offer this:  #election #trump #biden #TRUMP2020Landside  https://t.co/qOPYugXeaC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JessicaTarlov Read "this" because you are highly intelligent, but I thoroughly disagree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveHiltonx He is definitely a character.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatiePavlich Sounds like he is concerned that the truth is resonating with voters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizClaman @ClamanCountdown THANK YOU!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nprpolitics EMBARRASSED. STATE LEGISLATURE RULED BY GOP TOO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne Even used copies are good because the used books still have plenty of prosperity. Its unstoppable!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>why is it that links on faithgateway lead to other obs studies and not You are never alone? @MaxLucado<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveHiltonx Sounds like today?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyjashinsky What come back?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MelissaAFrancis I hope for our country and everyone in it that you are correct.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(\_/) ( ‚Ä¢_‚Ä¢) / &gt; üôè<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaxLucado Looking forward to Monday now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marklevinshow Most of the powerful white supremacists have been Democrats. So no surprise that he is endorsing Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatTimpf but because you came to NYC, we all get to see and learn about you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dagenmcdowell Like Twitter, Facebook, The Mob, etc......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyjashinsky Strength through silence. üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WallWallb Who is that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Truly extra awesome debate 8:30 to 9:00! @MorningsMaria  @dagenmcdowell  @cvpayne   and everyone else I can't remember.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlanDersh I would listen, but the podcast is not on an open platform podcast host. Freedom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dagenmcdowell That really is an insult to the pelletized ecrement industry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dagenmcdowell Do to him what he did to that poor dog!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Then fire him!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlanDersh Would be nice to listen too, but I don't do Apple. They are to closed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marklevinshow Getting more nuts everyday. I didn't think that was possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bicep22853    https://t.co/cwiv9NoQUr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@petapixel Quite useful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatiePavlich That Joe isn't a nice guy. Most of us named Joe are nice guys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greggutfeld and so are they (the media) ghoulish and repugnant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyjashinsky Not a difficult choice. Just choose the third path even if you have to make yourself.  I watched no TV streaming shows last night because of the dnc, and I didn't miss it. I might be on to something, at least for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you @JesseBWatters  for the sad news of Cannon Hinnant. I live in NC, and even our local news is not covering this. UPDATE: 25 year old neighbor charged. He was known to family, even sharing a meal with the family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dagenmcdowell @cvpayne You know that would be very interesting, and entertaining. Could you imagine the candidates being called on their bull**** an camera? Love it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dagenmcdowell @JaniceDean And sell them for donations to MS research.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@saramcdowellart @dagenmcdowell @TheRobio If I had anything of value to say it would be this: Be who you are and NEVER try to bow to what the world wants you to be. Never be subservient. Never play dumb. And always believe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaxLucado @DenalynLucado 7/21 = 29 years for us.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LysaTerKeurst Thank you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dagenmcdowell Yours? (Hope not.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MariaBartiromo @NYSE @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness @CNBC It is a wonderful accomplishment. You deserve it 100 times over. Congratulations!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedGiantNews Sounds like Photoshop for Iphone!  Although you should not discount Android. Some of us prefer Android.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nypost I guess Covid really has legs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatTimpf Blunt and to the point. Love it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaxLucado @Sandramccracken What time?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dagenmcdowell He's wrong He's mean. He got translated!  BTW, we love how you speak your mind and heart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dagenmcdowell @greggutfeld that's not nice to best friend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatTimpf But did you get a free copy? @dagenmcdowell  said she had to pay for one yesterday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne   Awesome suite. One of ny favorite colors<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marklevinshow Not surprised, but am saddened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dagenmcdowell didn't know you were also a blond too.  You are Multi-Follicle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizClaman Welcome back, your dreams were your ticket out..........  Sorry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dagenmcdowell How do they expect to enforce it?  Their staff never confronts anyone. Ever!  Also, why are they waiting?  Do it now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Redskins set to retire name today. Your thoughts?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Homerun!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dagenmcdowell Let me put my teeth in first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dagenmcdowell I have 8 followers and I don't show my a**. Should I change my strategy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Followed both. Retweeted Same.  Awesome stuff here. Even if you don't win, these two that you follow here will tweet much useful info.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They have great stuff. It gets better everyday. So what are you waiting for? RETWEET!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dagenmcdowell Sorry to but in, but Bluegrass isn't so bad. I didn't used to like it. Now it is not bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dagenmcdowell Yes you are. My error. Forgive this fool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dagenmcdowell Then even censoring a bad movie is dangerous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marklevinshow I am sure if I trust that guy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne I do understand. I have been there, but not like you. You didn't get to say goodbye. I am so sorry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dagenmcdowell With all these numbers, we should remember that the numbers represent real people, their families, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedGiantNews You keep making this stuff gooder. ü§£<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dagenmcdowell @ellisonbarber You know, if she really wanted to scare her MOM, then just she should just tell MOM she's pregnant. If that is not enough, then have your MOM's idea of the worst possible partner for you standing beside you (or a picture would do). Just crazy thoughts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dagenmcdowell Heartbreaking is one word I would use. Two others words would be idiocy and criminal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LysaTerKeurst What you wrote X 100.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fstoppers Price too high.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MaxLucado Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What ARE you drinking @dagenmcdowell ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne yes we will<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizClaman @RosieKDog No. She is on the sheet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne So sorry.  Prayer for them and their family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizClaman @ClamanCountdown Yes they are. I am sorry for the team members loss.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera @JoeBiden And Futures are up @ 9:08 DOW 454 points. Happy, but a head scratcher.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dagenmcdowell  There is nothing wrong with being a "loser or a nerd".   I know. BE YOU!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Franklin_Graham @BGEA Actually I am not worried about the future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dagenmcdowell ALWAYS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marklevinshow But the Fed wants inflation. They think inflation is good. Prices go up and paychecks don't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedGiantNews Thank you but Please hurry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KristinBTate Disagree. NOT taking a bailout could result in many state employees, like teachers, losing their jobs. State employees always bear the burden of these types of draconian cuts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>never thought I would see negative oil @LizClaman .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dagenmcdowell @SirajAHashmi I can't afford $5. How about a nickle?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatTimpf Convenient.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedGiantNews Looking forward to PIP. Might be able to use it to show a virtual choir or band.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Awakeland3D @RedGiantNews Great video. Great demo of video tools. Where did you get them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KristinBTate It is. Great article you tweeted. Thank you. @PoppyNoor  you nailed it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera @wtam1100 'Tis curious you are the only one I have heard talking about this. I wonder why. Keep going.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marklevinshow Maybe, Probably. However, is a blog a reliable source for news? Isn't this what HuffPo is, but from the left. Just saying we don't need to stoop to that level.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well worth it. I use it. It really is all I need.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatTimpf How do I share a stone tablet picture?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizClaman Tears of joy for that dog and his wonder owner. Seriously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Franklin_Graham @michaelwsmith @FoxNews I am DVRing it because I have to be at a church to stream something there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatTimpf and relief.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanaPerino Honestly, I'm missing a full hour of The Five.  I really do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like your ringtone @TuckerCarlson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marklevinshow Good. But my team will still be bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LysaTerKeurst Amen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaxLucado It won't. We are live streaming 2 Easter services, outdoor if possible. We are also filming the services to post on YouTube in case streaming fails. AND, we will post a pod cast of each service. Praise GOD. Worship WILL NOT stop!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizClaman @FoxBusiness Consumers cheer now. What happens after the US crude industry folds? Higher prices for consumers and dependence on foreign powers who do not like us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dagenmcdowell Chipped tooth and no dental procedures allowed now. Ouch!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizClaman THAT'S AWESOME!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@glennbeck Waste of time to argue with a socialist comrade.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dagenmcdowell NEVER thought I would see that number.  And I have seen a lot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizClaman Its Jobs day. 6.684 million jobless claims. Wow. Never thought I would see that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizClaman @ClamanCountdown @FoxBusiness can't wait!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arimoin @LizClaman But you can't find masks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizClaman @AviReichental These stories and information you constantly bring us is very anxiety reliving and so much appreciated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBGLibrary I knew @seanhannity stole this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne @lizpeek is correct. When are you due back Charles?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizClaman Futures DOW down 850 now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaxLucado @foxandfriends We Video Live streamed our Worship and we also recorded it for a podcast. Worship continues. As you said @MaxLucado we don't need a building to Worship. God Bless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More pictures @realDonaldTrump .  You are MY president. Fire those giving you bad data. @WalmartInc Get the shelves full in Mocksville NC!  https://t.co/DDIJIP6qEq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wheres the food?  Where is the baby formula?  Where is the toilet paper?  Don't  tell us things are not accurate @realDonaldTrump .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No offense intended @realDonaldTrump but this is what I saw at @WalmartInc . Empty shelves! Not full shelves like you said. #VIRUS_CORONA  https://t.co/jiLWPWK8an<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BGEA @Franklin_Graham Don't let worship stop because of this! My church is going to video live stream Worship and also do a podcast recording. Don't let the enemy win!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne Hey, I didn't get a special message from @cvpayne in my order. What is up with that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LysaTerKeurst Let HIM also add Joshua 1:9 -  "Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.‚Äù<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LysaTerKeurst WHAT HE SAID.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatTimpf I say get busy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizClaman (groans). The pain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizClaman @federalreserve Hasn't the fed opened a commercial paper facility with a 1 trillion upper limit (Steven Mnuchin@ covid19 presser)?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizClaman Liz please get some sleep. We need you tomorrow and it might be rough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera And the conspiracy theories fly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera Let not your heart be troubled @GeraldoRivera .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizClaman @ClamanCountdown @arimoin Didn't they already decide that. I did hear it on Claman show.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizClaman Hope it lasts!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatTimpf No you won't. TV is a one way medium. I will see you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad to see @MariaBartiromo on @Varneyco .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizClaman @ClamanCountdown The last 2 weeks have been horrible. I have been watching. I am always relived at 4pm because it will be a few hours before it gets worse. Thank you for being there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera And watch The Five.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elonmusk Finally. Hope people listen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MariaBartiromo @DrOz @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness Why are the numbers (%) different than whats showing on the scroll.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@STEPHMHAMILL @cvpayne @FoxBusiness Don't run fast so we'll have a chance to catch you. üòÉ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ash Wednesday. Praise GOD!  https://t.co/WjnySIRuSr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dagenmcdowell That's precious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizClaman 725 down now.  7:32 am<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dagenmcdowell Why do people send in such horrible things about him?  I love it when he reads the insults on air and embarrassing them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Your hair is not fuzzy today @dagenmcdowell   Have a great day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimonettiLauren  Just wanted to say that if you have a custom greeting for your voicemail, that hackers can get your voice from tjat as well. Also answering the call and hanging up verifies the number as valid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dagenmcdowell @RobertVCampbel2 Taking breath x 2.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dagenmcdowell 1917 is about WW I. Not WW II.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlanDersh I surrender.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaxLucado Are you saying that we should act to leave a legacy? Leave a mark so our names will be remembered?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizClaman @foxandfriends @KennedyNation @Varneyco @ainsleyearhardt @SteveDoocy @kilmeade @ClamanCountdown That was great to see, the entrance part. I had to go teach children (high school) following the intro.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LollyDaskal Actually you can if the world around yoy is changing for the worse.  I would go on but then I would start quoting scripture.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LollyDaskal All of which seem to be forgotten today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>awesome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LollyDaskal Through all the tweets lately, one thread keeps repeating: Be Humble.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatTimpf Why I'm not watching.  üòÉ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Unexplained Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LollyDaskal How can one achieve these traits of success?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>good stuff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizClaman Beautiful way to start the day! Thank you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dagenmcdowell @JaniceDean @dagenmcdowell   My wife tells a joke about a talking parrot named Chet that sings a aong when you hold a flame under it's feet.  Know the song?  "Chet's Nuts Roasting On An Open Fire."  Just a joke, but she tells it so well with special voices.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LollyDaskal Simple. Not have the meeting.  Or be organized, efficient, and brief.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LollyDaskal I do these all the time. It is amazing how such simple things can make your little part of the world so much nicer. Doing things like these may rub off on others too. Thank you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greggutfeld and missing The Five, which really does piss me off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greggutfeld Are you Gilligan?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marklevinshow Interesting. Twitter recommended I follow @marklevinshow  and used this tweet to do it. üòÉ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyjashinsky Hard Candy Christmas. Tears! and Joy too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CSLewisDaily You do not know whether Trump is a Christian or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera Maybe they just like how you feel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne Favorite song, I know them well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dagenmcdowell @JeffShank1 My ear buds were in. What was that? üòÉ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyjashinsky Will always be a dog person who has cats too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizClaman A View to a Kill. #1 all time for me.  Christopher Walken does a great psycho path!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is @greggutfeld doing right now?  The Five isn't on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizClaman @Algorand We would never blame anyone with Claman Countdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne But my wife might get mad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne On my way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@castingcrowns I didn't like the silence after the last track finished.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizClaman He's barking up the right tree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC I disagree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@conservmillen Your views are so extreme they feel normal to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne This must be stopped. Prosperity is bad.  üòé (i was never here.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump my friend's brother's girlfriend's niece's boyfriend said you're guilty. So it must be true. How many hands is that? Four, as in forth hand?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OliviaEnos That's an interesting question qnd you didn't limit the question to ballet. Why don't you do a Twitter Poll?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dagenmcdowell So sorry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theToriKSmith Hope he correct. Thank you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizClaman Good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyjashinsky Agent of the GOP? Really? What planet is she from?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatTimpf Take it off and show us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidNathanaelx @jerryma81755221 @conservmillen I agree. He gave us life and life should valued.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@curtis_serben @conservmillen Only Jesus can judge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FergusFSU @jerryma81755221 @conservmillen No we don't hate questions about our Faith. Who are you to judge anyone's faith? Jesus warned us about judging others. Have you read the bible?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FergusFSU @jerryma81755221 @conservmillen And a Christian trying to boxJesus into their view as opposed to His words written in scripture. I pray for you. Good day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FergusFSU @jerryma81755221 @conservmillen Yes and it is that same church based in Rome that canonized the bible and decided that Gospel written by women were not worthy. The Church back then was very much against women. Jesus was not. He loved everyone. His final command was: love one another as He loved us. Praise God!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jerryma81755221 @conservmillen There always that chance that they're correct and I'm not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FergusFSU @jerryma81755221 @conservmillen Read scripture. He talks to our hearts that way. We have but to listen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@curtis_serben @conservmillen not assuming. just trying not to judge him specifically.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jerryma81755221 @conservmillen oops. you're correct.  üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@conservmillen Unfortunately many Christians, including pastors, miss what scripture says in plain text and in their hearts by the Spirit. They try to mix God with our politics. Sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne I'm at work and can't see it. what were the numbers, est and act?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne Absolutely. Good advice. Thank you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BGEA Amen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikeroweworks sings Nation Anthem in S3E4 of DIRTY JOBS. He has a great voice.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cvpayne @foxandfriends @ainsleyearhardt @kilmeade @SteveDoocy I thing your forgetting Charles is that Millennials do not necessarily vote based on their pocketbook. In many instances, it seems, they vote on grand idea without examining the implications.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CooperrWall @WallWallb I have for a lifetime.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BGEA @AGLotz I'm not trying to be difficult @AGLotz . I have bought several of your books and an even larger number of Rev. Graham's books. So how does it stand that those books are spiritual candy as you wrote in this article? I am thoroughly confused and concerned. Please help me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BGEA @AGLotz Interesting that @AGLotz says in the opening that part of the spiritual junk food is books on Gods word and retreats and conferences. @AGLotz has written a lot of those books and taught a lot of retreats. How does she stand on this? It seems to be a bit of a conflict. @AGLotz ?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bltndvd @Franklin_Graham @jeremycamp Prayer for @bltndvd :  Lord, please show David Bolten your Grace and Love, that he may come to know and be saved by you.   In Jesus Christ name I pray, Amen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizClaman @foxandfriends @FoxNews @FoxBusiness See you @ 3pm. Watching @MorningsMaria now.  Sorry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@conservmillen If you weren't we wouldn't know what happens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@conservmillen I can't afford pronouns. Mine are amateurs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LysaTerKeurst Over 200 people stood and received Jesus tonight in Hickory. Praise God!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Franklin_Graham @jeremycamp Over 200 stood to receive Jesus tonight.  Luke 15: 3-7  Verse 7: I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BGEA @Franklin_Graham Over 200 people stood and received Jesus tonight in Hickory. Praise God!    Thank you @Franklin_Graham .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Franklin_Graham We are up and streaming here too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@conservmillen They do enjoy it. $300 for a cut &amp; color?  I objected when a cut alone was$15. I'm glad I shaved my head. No worries now!   üòÅ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LysaTerKeurst Even in the darkest of storms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dagenmcdowell Love it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Franklin_Graham I rededicated tonight. Tomorrow I'm hosting a gathering of people who are not able to attend the Hickory event. We're going to stream it live in our fellowship hall.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dagenmcdowell I am at a loss for words right now @dagenmcdowell .  Mr President @realDonaldTrump  you must reengage now! THIS IS WRONG!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LysaTerKeurst Remember, all these whispers have a response from God. Just pray and have faith in Him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LysaTerKeurst So true. That is the only filter I need.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CSLewisDaily Not really. Why do you need proof of God's word?  Do you not have Faith?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fstoppers I think when you start judging others work as being inferior to your work, is where a photographer should stop and re-evaluate. Evaluating another as inferior helps your pride but stunts your growth. One can learn new things from the "less experienced".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBGLibrary @BillyGraham Not in our spotlight, but I think his mission was always in his spotlight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BGEA Wonderful prayer to our Lord.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikeroweworks These podcasts are wonderful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne Don't forget about   @MariaBartiromo , @TeamCavuto , and @LizClaman .  IMHO, The 5 best business shows.  It does not get any better than this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@glennbeck @realDonaldTrump unroll<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dagenmcdowell @RealClearNews Is this good or bad?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizClaman @DavidBGalloway Seriously!  He must be on the wrong channel.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@fstoppers It does look fraudulent, but looks can be deceiving.  Maybe redesign the website.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne @Redskins @Patriots @TheJuanWilliams What a nightmare.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne @Redskins @Patriots But the 'Skins scored first!  Right @TheJuanWilliams ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FitnessRedline Following you!  One of favorite places!  Will you follow back?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Franklin_Graham So you told them the truth without suger coating it? Awesome.   Praise God. Amen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@conservmillen According to Wikipedia, Schiff was raised in a Jewish family.    https://t.co/0wzctWKWDn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 I doubt it was good investments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne Thank you wise sir.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HumeKantDance @conservmillen Their words not mine. I am not a hateful person nor am I unhinged. It is not that I disagree with AOC, it is simply that she disagreed with the time frame, not the eating of babies. That is truly abhorrent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne  You said this morning that you are only worried about the oil patch. Isn't manufacturing also an issue we should be concerned about?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonHe87339022 @conservmillen Hard to dispute a video. That is not stupid. Calling someone stupid is simply an attempt to denigrate and marginalize a viewpoint  you  do not like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ValueCritic @conservmillen @AOC But AOC did not object to eating babies. That is the entire point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ValueCritic @conservmillen Yes, and as you just confirmed, eating babies is perfectly fine with progressives. This point was not disputed and that is shocking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@conservmillen Something else was pointed out by someone on a different thread:. AOC and most people there DID NOT object to what she was saying, just the way she was saying it. Also not good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizClaman @ClamanCountdown @FoxBusiness It's like this. You want the truth and best analysis, you go to FBN. Especially at 3 pm. No fluff or flattery,just my opinion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Impeach goodness?  Not in America!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@conservmillen I will also pray for you @TalbertSwan . May you find him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatTimpf @AOC OMG! Getting crazy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizClaman @FoxNews @FoxBusiness @SusanLiTV Sorry I missed. But I bet the one who scored the most points won.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LilaGraceRose Please don't force YOUR lies and faulty beliefs on others @pollarinecn1 !  Please also stop trying to silence others from expressing viewpoints different from yours!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera No money, no outrage. Shouldn't be that way, but it is. Sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BruceKlingner He said Americans wouldn't feel the tariff bite.  Nooooooooooo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatTimpf Wouldn't you rather be addicted to life than nicotine?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne I've always thought that about these "polls", especially immediately before an election. For example, someone not paying attention to election news sees a poll showing candidate H leading candidate D might vote ror H because it seems like H is better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xkcdComic Trying to Curry favor I see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne No nuts in inventory. sorry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AGLotz All I can say is Praise God. He is always there for us, but we must be willing to hear him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AGLotz Just got it on my Kindle!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fstoppers No goodies for singles. sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne Watch out for the tree huggers!  ü§£<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera Actually @GeraldoRivera , a 50 caliber version of the AR-15 is available. I won't but the link here, so I can't be accused of spreading violence.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is awesome!  Congrats @MorningsMaria .   FOX News re-signs FBN anchor Maria  Bartiromo to a new multi-year deal   https://t.co/n7uHXgex8e #FoxBusiness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne @DiMartinoBooth @DavidBahnsen @MAGAindex @Paul_Schatz Book or not, some people are just not good at public elucidation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AGLotz release the book!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera Probably many of us. Do you have to use profanity in this post. How does the word s*** enhance this post.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera Maybe. But the ultimate cost of this will be borne by others, not Saudi Arabia. For example, that poor family of four who can not afford higher gas, won't be able to work to buy food.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillyGraham as i nearly experienced this week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bold_To_Pray @RealCandaceO Thank you so much. I got out of the hospital last night but am still recovering. Praying everyday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizClaman @FDNY @helpbhh You will make a difference. God bless you Liz.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BGEA @TellaGraham i can't co.w forward. I'm in a hospital.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatTimpf they just hate me. you, @greggutfeld , @BGEA , @cvpayne , @TeamCavuto etc.   gues thats why.    either that or I'm a complete unknown to the famous people and you. üòÄ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealCandaceO Fan of yours bit I have been in the hospital all week. sorry. can't be there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBGLibrary @StrawMinistries If you don't listen, then he'll get your attention. I didn't listen and my actions got me in the hospital. He is saving from from my self for his service with the care I received.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne as long as I get the money I'm good. üòÅ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GingerJ66019714 @cvpayne @lizpeek @PatricePinkFile @KevinRKelly_ @ScottyMarkets @KFGTotalWealth @EthanBearman @emma_meshell @DubauskasJan it did. made me smile.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatTimpf I'm in a hospital with breathing problems -3 days because of that. Stop vaping @KatTimpf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne @lizpeek @PatricePinkFile @KevinRKelly_ @ScottyMarkets @KFGTotalWealth @EthanBearman @emma_meshell @DubauskasJan Hopes its good. Watching from my hospital bed -3rd day.  Make me happy. üòÅ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MariaBartiromo  Watching from my hospital bed. Great show again.   @MorningsMaria  Great show today team, as always. Unfortunately I'm watch world from hospital bed. But getting better I think. Have a great day and weekend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dagenmcdowell Hardly anyone knows that movie. I liked that movie, bur I am weird like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne Make it good. I'm watching from my hospital bed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Read a book. I hear "The Gutfeld Monologues" is good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AGLotz Wonderful! Is there a transcript? I do better reading.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I climbed 10 floors today and got the Happy Hill badge with Fitbit!  https://t.co/PVjMJq7Ymm #Fitstats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheJuanWilliams  Do you have video of your sermon?  I would love to see it. This is a  topic that has been concerning me a great deal lately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edhenry @foxandfriends glad you're back. don't shave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne Good news?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaniceDean  You say that so well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne Honda Ridgeline. Style and class.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne It was out of order today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Unexplained No.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera I disagree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Unexplained Nothing. They are just daddy long legs. Harmless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyjashinsky Catch anything?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatTimpf as long as you don't get pissed off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne But you know its that little imperfection that makes us all a little more genuine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clark_packard @torikwhiting Isn't that what the WTO does?  The problem is WTO does not have real enforcement power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GTSFarmer and @RealCandaceO   Congratulations on your upcoming wedding. May you both have joy and happiness in your lives together.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OliviaEnos @thejcoop Whether you are successful or not in actually have the date night, it is worth the effort. Yes?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JessicaTarlov @TheStoryFNC what time tomorrow?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cl8z @cvpayne So, the feds can be influenced. In this case for political reasons "to teach the President a lesson".  I understood that.  Hence my reply.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne In the divided society that we are today, this is not a surprise. Sadly.  This would not teach the president a lesson, but simple hurt low to middle income workers. Who is more important?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SaraCarterDC @IlhanMN So he's her gigolo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LysaTerKeurst because he will wipe those tears away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mises But only He knows when that will be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another awesome suit @cvpayne . Great shows today also.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dagenmcdowell Oh how I love the southern lady "curse" thrown sown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds like @bicep22853 !<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bicep22853<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NatlParkService A visit to a national park has not inspired me. I have never been to one.  What excites me is the fact that our nation has the foresight and insight to establish the parks to preserve the wild places and our heritage.  Happy birthday  NPS!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cvpayne   Very sharp today. Like the jacket. üëç<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awesome interview with Navaro this morning @MariaBartiromo on @MorningsMaria . Steller. Its why I put the show on every day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mclaurenseries I'm glad a doctor finally listened to a patient and looked further. Too often they don't and put it off as just being all in the patients head.    Also I hope you get better!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatiePavlich You are absolutely correct. They know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CSLewisDaily Don't worry. You'll know when he really comes back. You won't miss it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CSLewisDaily THIS is 5/16/2019. What took so long? He could have come and gone by now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne Makes you look younger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@roselavelle Sweat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyjashinsky I wonder why.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatTimpf Just put it to the side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BGEA @BillyGraham Actually not a surprise, on quality alone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mclaurenseries I didn't know the rainforest was fire. We just don't have a real news source anywhere anymore. Its all politics, entertainment, realty tv, etc.  Well when we can't breath anymore, maybe we'll hear about this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LibertyCliff @KristinBTate True. It will also make criminals out of millions of American Citizens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyjashinsky Either its very fresh salad or they bought the protein enhanced version. Since they don't want the frog I hope the frog is set free.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyjashinsky Wow. Celebrating a murder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizClaman The liberal elite think FNC &amp; FBC are state run. Does this mean liberal Twitter will forgo ad money from Fox?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatiePavlich Israel = Racist  Palestine = Good  That is what they say and will keep saying because it fits their narrative. They will ignore this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne It is also a possibility that there will be no recession, correct?  It is a further possibility that this is a political headline meant to hurt @realDonaldTrump and his reelection.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BGEA My prayer: Great and Glorious Lord, May your Grace and Love show through me to others and my actions reflect Glory to you. Amen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@breeannnn_ @Unexplained I guess that means he will love you forever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KristinBTate @YALiberty @foxnewsnight Non-thinkers without skill require someone/something to lead them. Sounds like that is what they want. Goverment dependence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ONLY JESUS album is Awesome.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KatTimpf makeup or clothing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatTimpf the juul.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatTimpf so this one will be used on the Gutfeld show?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh boy. @LizClaman . The Trumpers are going to come after you today about his "trade wars being easy" but "never said China was easy". Especially since you provided proof. Ouch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CSLewisDaily Interesting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dagenmcdowell I want him. I hope he finds a furever home very soon!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Unexplained Hold still. This won't hurt a bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhanham Just use a rooster avatar. problem solved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne We must also remember that hearing views we don't agree with gives us the knowledge of what they are saying. If we know what they are saying we can be more prepared to expose and refute them. Call it intelligence gathering.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne @HaroldFordJr @GeraldStorch @RLHeinrichs @kelseybolar @philblancato @KFGTotalWealth @dietzepointview @shavarjeffries @Greg_Valliere Great lineup as always.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dagenmcdowell @jody_mazzarese @FoxBusiness @MorningsMaria As others have pointed out, including @Varneyco , we may be in a situation where the normal "rules" are not applicable right now. I have seen analysis on different FBN shows that have speculated this over the last several weeks. Just saying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizClaman @debra4KAG you are so incorrect. Have you even been paying attention? Give it a try.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizClaman I'm glad for the analysis. I just wish it wasn't needed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/8oEYbG5FA0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne Is it possible that the inversion is because of high volume treasures sales because of the negative yields elsewhere?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBellCFRA @StovallCFRA Just mentioned on @MorningsMaria  by @dagenmcdowell . Credited you.  That is why I watch FBN.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DavidBecken1 @Franklin_Graham @Disney One last thing (I not trying to harass you): Kevin Swanson has Jesus and the Gospels wrong. Never cared for him. No excuse but.....

<|startoftext|>@DavidBecken1 @Franklin_Graham @Disney If would be so kind and name that preacher. I would greatly appreciate it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatTimpf And on tv in70 minutes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LivingFacts Yes and I usually get all but castrated ror it. But Jesus is worth it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomiLahren Its better than doing nothing. I do see and agree with your point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidBecken1 @Franklin_Graham @Disney Actually in the bronze age homosexuals would be burned at the stake. Isn't it great that that time has past? So my "joke" is definitely not from that time. Bless you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will leave the dm up until Wednesday. It will be deleted after that. Please investigate.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AGLotz Thank you for this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealCandaceO No. She'll call you a deplorable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomiLahren The insanity and misinformation spreading just never stops with these people. It is just unbelievable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatTimpf @drdrew @RichVos @CarolinesonBway Good for you. Its good to branch out to new horizons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne Very good points. unfortunately I doubt anyone will listen.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BGEA @BillyGraham Thank you for tweeting that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera Access isn't the issue. The issue is a lack of healthcare for mental illnesses AND failures in the system to stop the mentally ill from getting weapons. For everyone else, access to weapons is why we are still relatively free.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fogcityfraiser @Franklin_Graham @bicep22853 Perhaps you need to add your prayers for all those who were injured or killed too. The more the merrier. Also, perhaps not mocking those who place faith in God would also be helpful. Your choice in either case. God Bless You.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LizClaman I found it and @LizClaman did not say @realDonaldTrump was to blame for the violence. She did say that, in the aggregate, Trump tweeted about 4 black or brown people, which gives material to his opposition to say he is racist when he clearly isn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizClaman What did you say then?  (I was at church and missed Media Buzz.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BGEA That is awesome. Praise God.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Franklin_Graham Reply to comments: This a simple request by @Franklin_Graham to pray for the victims. Lets put political opinion and debate aside for now. At least 20 people lost their life today. 26 wounded. Is that worth a simple prayer? @bicep22853<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wilcher_sharon @Franklin_Graham He didn't quote scripture.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CSLewisDaily The only problem with wearing a cross is when you are doing it with some other reason other than Jesus. Aprime example would be marketing your business towards Christians and blatantly wearing a cross where it will be very easily seen. See My Pillow for example.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BillyGraham Upon finding the perfect church, turn around and run. Something is not right.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BarryMacDoubleU @emilyjashinsky And 1 more thing, please don't use profanity. I did not use it and it is not called for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarryMacDoubleU @emilyjashinsky I am not a terrorist! Bernie is hiding in his Dacha.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KatTimpf You should stop worrying about what others think about you. Be who you are, who you want to be. If someone doesn't like it, **** them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyjashinsky I hope you dvr'd it. Wait. That was a stupid thing to say. Of course you  are recording it. The real question should be: Did you set an alarm  to wake up after the debates are over so you watch something more interesting?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dagenmcdowell @scribandotcom Fox Business never neutral. They are on Americas side. Thats good for US.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne Well I think they are all losers, so yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyjashinsky That's what I keep trying to tell people, you just don't know who is really behind the screen name. Wow.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KatTimpf Can I DVR?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greglaurie So sad. I thought silence might be your reply. I was hoping to not hear silence, but the silence to my reply is deafening. I assume that when someone disagrees with you, then are cast out by your silence. May you be blessed by God. Amen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greglaurie @randyalcorn Amen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilyjashinsky Are you against Daylight Savings Time?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greglaurie I thoroughly disagree. A Christian who has lost their testimony is NOT pathetic and does not deserve to be mocked in such a manner. A Christian who has lost their testimony needs help from us and most especially God. Prayer and support, not pity and mocking.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cvpayne @DiMartinoBooth @kelseybolar @FoxBusiness Really? Money is a monopoly: "Modern Monetary Theory (MMT or Modern Money Theory): the currency as a public monopoly and unemployment as the evidence that a currency monopolist is restricting the supply of the financial assets needed to pay taxes and satisfy savings desires"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne @FoxBusiness Bad Idea. But our Republican Legislators (I'm live in NC) want to make grad rates look higher. Next up will be guaranteed HS diplomas.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LizClaman Great. But I don't think much will change, sadly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne WWTD:  TWEET storm you!  But you would still live. üòé<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cvpayne Did someone speak my real name?  Shhhh. It's secret. Tell no one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizClaman Hopefully it is a good deal and lasts far beyond his presidency.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LizClaman Actually a good pic. It follows the "rule of thirds" very well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Varneyco I would agree, but I don't want it to come back and haunt me.<|endoftext|>
