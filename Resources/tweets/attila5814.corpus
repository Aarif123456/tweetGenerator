<|startoftext|>@unionlib No doubt he will be taking his guide dog with him. That way he will know when he is near the ground when the lead goes slack.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBC Who decides what ppe is necessary, the doctors who need it or the politicians who are desperate to ration it in order to cover up their incompetence?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews good to see that your front line reporter's are well equipped with ppe,better than the nhs staff it would seem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WorkersPartyGB Only another 500,000 to go to be as relevant as the Labour party👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carolecadwalla Can someone please throw him off that roof<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EveryCountry Definitely a cull<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@unionlib @MAPCampaigns Will give him 6 months and then see, there is no viable alternative to labour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Anyone travelling to a second home should have their doors nailed shut once they are inside and made to stay there for a fortnight.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@georgegalloway @MoatsTV By the way, what ever happened to the Respect party, did the funding dry up?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mrjamesob Jeremy Corbyn was a decent leader and always wanted a fair deal for the working classes. It's just unfortunate that he was carrying too much baggage to be electable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tpopularfront If you want to be part of a constantly losing cause you could join George Galloway's socialist workers party<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@unionlib Just before he went down the local Inn, put 3 nails on the bar and said "can you put me up for the night"<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SamuelM35427190 @carolecadwalla Always a good idea to have a recess in the middle of a national emergency. This PM needs to be held to account<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@unionlib You can't show compassion when you're orchestrating a cull, which is clearly what this government are doing the poor will be blamed for not self isolating ☠️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carolecadwalla If you can have cabinet meetings by zoom, then why not PMQ's?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@georgegalloway @MoatsTV Go to the pub. But definitely not wetherspoons, that tosser Tim Martin deserves to be driven into bancrupcy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@georgegalloway The government needs to institute a basis income to make sure everyone has financial security. They should take a 49% share of all plc's to help pay for it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@georgegalloway @WorkersPartyGB As much as I admire and follow you George it would take a lot more than the offer of a free book to dessert the Labour Party. 120yrs, 3pm's, all from the centre. Prefer Lisa N but would support Kier. It's the only sensible way to defeat the tories in my lifetime. May buy the book<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@georgegalloway @MoatsTV The supermarkets should fill the empty shelves with coffins so people can panic buy those as well.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@unionlib If there was a contract on this prick's life, the price just went down considerably. Not that I would wish any harm to come to even imbecile like this one.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RPLibertyReport I can't believe idiots like you are still comparing #coronavirus to the flu. People are dying every few minutes in Europe, there is no vaccine and no cure.

<|startoftext|>@georgegalloway @MoatsTV A suitable body bag to crawl into just before you die due to the abysmal performance of this government. And I do not say that to run down the fantastic efforts of the NHS. It's a wonder that they can perform at all considering what the Tory's have done to them in the last 10 yrs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beyondclem @AndyBurnhamGM @Gabe55Gabe @MattHancock I'm sure Chris Grayling is being lined up to take over at a moments notice ☠️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@unionlib A Fistfull of dollars up your bum<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC This is the moment the pretence that the good Friday agreement was based on meets reality. The pretence that republicans in NI can be Irish, whilst at the same time unionists can be British and the pretence that a border between two  separate. states doesn't exist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC What happened to the tories being the party of family values?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage If any civil servant is knifed or violently attacked you will be to blame.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC What about VAT exemption and charitable status. Fine have private schools, but don't expect the taxpayer to subsidies them in any way or form.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Increasingly demented Nigel Farage, not bemused.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC There's no such thing as a clean break brexit, only a complete fucking nightmare. The only option is to leave with a deal or remain. Labour's position is far better than that of the lib dems, who would not even want you to have the option.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC More brexit party bullshit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage The brexit party, live from wherever Nigel can scam a few more quid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Clean break brexit, new sound bite same disaster<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Another 2 hour party political broadcast on behalf of the brexit party. Keep your £25 subscriptions coming, Nigel needs them to keep living in the style Aaron Banks was paying for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC I wonder what would happen if the EU offered a deal where we could leave with no deal, but with the choice of changing our minds within 6 months if we don't like the outcome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC How does close cooperation with EU military differ from close cooperation with NATO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC If Boris can't handle a small noisy crowd, what's he going to do when the general election really starts?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage The only betrayal was that of the 1.5 million brits who were refused a vote in a referendum that was only won by 600,000 votes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamualCotes @Nigel_Farage It's not won in the minds of the 16.8 million remainer's nor in the minds of all those millions who couldn't vote in 2016 but who could now. Thats why Nigel is terrified of another referendum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @Nigel_Farage Nigel, I seem to remember you saying that if the brexit vote went 52 /48 remain it would be unfinished business. You really need to remember what you said in the past if you are going to lie through your teeth on the radio for personal profit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC The only person sounding desperate is you Nigel, you're terrified that people are starting to wake up to bullshit that you've peddling for the last 3 years<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Nigel, all the immigration people need to do is hand the immigrants a copy of yellowhammer and they will be begging to be sent back, they will probably claim that their human rights have been abused if we keep them here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Friday 13th is unlucky because its the day that the knight templars were rounded up and executed. The order went out secretly to be enacted on that date<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC If Boris doesn't like the decision he could take it to the EU courts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Since when did you tell the truth to anyone Nigel, you're hardly in a position to come across all indignant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Mp's could have voted not to shut down parliament for the conference season, proroging parliament stopped from doing that. That's the real issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@countryhousegnt Watching series 5on Amazon,what's happened to episode 2 am going into withdrawal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Nigel, if you admit that the referendum was binding, surely it should be rerun due to the criminal activities of the leave campaign. After all you can't have it both ways<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC If Jeremy Corbyn has stopped people talking about brexit how come your still gassing on, and how come LBC has aloud you the longest party political broadcast in history<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yoda's on#Marr<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBC Nigel, please tell me when an election didn't take place on Thursday. It has to be the 10th of October, its the only date that makes sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage Can't wait to see you all loose your deposits<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC If Donald Trump buys the UK, he will probably buying it from the Chinese.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Let's see if he makes it to the end of the month<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC The Conservative Party consists of around 160,000 members, most of whom are dropping like flies from old age. What Boris needs to calculate is how many tory voters have switched to remain, because these are the people who are most likely to switch their vote to Lib Dem.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage Aaron Banks has just stated on #marr that he would vote remain in a new referendum. Is this the rats finally leaving the sinking ship or is he right to be conserned? And do you agree with his assessment of brexit.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBC @Nigel_Farage The brexiter's in the tory party had their chance for a brexit PM when Cameron stood down and they bottled it.

<|startoftext|>@LBC @Nigel_Farage Anything that has bricking it Nigel is more than acceptable, it's absolutely brilliant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage The candidates who stood against TM were both hard line brexiter's and both stood down. Were they afraid that if she had been elected by the tory members that her current stance would be legitasiced<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBC There is absolutely no chance of getting the brexit that was voted for because that brexit was based on a complete pack of lies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC If you are so sure of a brexit victory why are you so scared of another vote once the true facts are known<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage You also need to send a message to the leave Mp's to deliver the brexit they promised at the referendum even if that means extending article 50, no one voted no deal, no one voted WTO.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mrjamesob James, l think in order for you to understand the position that JC is in on brexit you should spend an hour on your show explaining why you think Britain will be better off leaving the EU. I look forward to listening<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrjamesob @jeremycorbyn Jeremy Corbyn is not miles ahead in the poles because not only does he have to contend with the ultra right wing media, but also the blairites on his back benches who are hell bent on getting rid of him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @Nigel_Farage Nigel, we used to manufacture and sell things, shipped around the world by our merchant navy. All long gone. No wonder JRM is now saying we won't see any benefit for at least 50 years, what he really means is we won't see any benefit in our lifetime.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBC @Nigel_Farage Where's Boris, where's Gove, I bet that they are in Dublin swigging pints of Guinness with JRM having put their millions into his new EU based investment funds, whilst leaving the rest of us to get screwed. I wonder if they have included Nigel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @Nigel_Farage Nigel, how many brexit supporting Mp's had the chance to run against her for PM. Every one of them bottled out. I wonder why!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@faisalislam I hope that they are going to seriously stock up the food banks, I suspect a lot more of us will be relient on them post brexit.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBC @TomSwarbrick1 The government should do more along the lines of House arrest controlled by tagging for non violent criminals.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LBC @Nigel_Farage A second referendum would be pointless, remainer's like myself would vote no in the hope of staying in, leavers would vote no in the hope of a no deal brexit. Who would vote yes?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisCurley11 @LBC @Nigel_Farage The same as Robert Mugabe maybe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @Nigel_Farage Nigel, didn't the PM set up a royal commission on this when she was home secretary?, when do you think that one will report. Your attitude on this matter is to just keep kicking it down the road.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @Nigel_Farage I heard on the radio earlier that the UK is one of the world's largest producers of medicinal cannabis, yet its illegal in the UK. Work that one out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @Nigel_Farage Harold Wilson loved Royal commotions . He said that they take minutes to set up and years to report. The only people benefiting at the moment are the criminal gangs who deal in this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC @Nigel_Farage Nigel, correct me if I am wrong, since the referendum we have had a general election. Everyone in the house of commons has been returned to the house by their constituents, knowing their views on brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichelleDewbs Totally agree with you, the things are worse than cigarettes and should be banned in public places.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC This is all bollox, people will always vote how they choose to vote, it is only the arrogance of over paid arse holes like you that think they make the difference?<|endoftext|>
