<|startoftext|>If we never learn how to overcome failures we will give up on our dreams, goals and aspirations #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BroWM46 is giving guidance on how to overcome failure #1 Remember its not final but a stage in progress to success #2 Look for the lessons in the failure #3 Apply the lessons we learned #4 Forgive yourself #5 Educate yourself #6 Try again #Mosque46 #noisundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BroWM46 is informing and explaining to the audience how the life of Peter and Jesus are signs of @LouisFarrakhan &amp; his teacher Most Honorable Elijah Muhammad #Mosque46 #noisundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Peter's public failure was only a sign of the internal failure that many who believed in Jesus experienced @BroWM46 #Mosque46 #noisundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Peter had to be prepared for his future responsibility which was to represent Christ to the people and stand in his place!!! @BroWM46 #Mosque46 #noisundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some failures are for purification! Peter had to grow in humility! Nothing like failure that will humble us! Success doesn't humble many of us! @BroWM46 #Mosque46 #noisundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't allowed a failed marriage cause you to give up on love! Don't allow one failed business to cause you to give up! Don't allow a fall in faith or morality cause you to give up! @BroWM46 #mosque46 #noisundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our failures should not be our final resting place as well!!!! @BroWM46  #Mosque46 #noisundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The LESSON in this is that his failure was NOT final!!!!! @BroWM46 #Mosque46 #noisundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imagine how Peter felt? Do you think he felt like he was successful? Do you think he was able to look himself and others in his face and their eyes? @BroWM46 #Mosque46 #noisundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Peter had many failures! His greatest failure was denying his teacher @BroWM46 #Mosque46 #noisundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Peter was Jesus top disciple! He was given a name by Jesus, was designated to build the church, identified Jesus as the Christ @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BroWM46 is now lifting up the life of the Disciple Peter to illustrate how we can overcome failure #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We must not be afraid to fail! This is the mindset of NEARLY ALL who have accomplished success! @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many successful people when interviewed on the subject of failure all stress that a key ingredient is to have a positive attitude toward failure. @BroWM46  #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At the root of failure and rebounding from failure is FEAR! The letters that make up FEAR are found in failure #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Failures and falling short of our goals even ONCE causes our brains to say abandon ship #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reason why this lecture is important #1 we all desire success and #2 God desires us to be successful according to the Bible and Quran<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet he had MANY failures! His GREATEST failure was the denial of his teacher! @BroWM46 #Mosque46 #noisundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Student Minister @BroWM46 will be delivering a lecture on the subject, "How to Overcome Failure?"<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We do not know the impact our acts of kindness can have on the lives of others. Let's find our purpose and make this a world a better place. #Mosque46 #NationofIslam #Farrakhan #noisundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have to take control of our lives. When you transform your life, your testimony can help someone else with the same problem. You can be an answer to their prayers. #Mosque46 #NationofIslam #Farrakhan #noisundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is no mystery God. In the end, we have to do the work. #Mosque46 #NationofIslam #Farrakhan #noisundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God said that the power is within you to solve your problems. We are an atheist of self. We disbelieve in ourselves. God means force and power, be the force and power to make your own solution. #Mosque46 #NationofIslam #Farrakhan #noisundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When we run from difficulty, we are running from that which will help us develop or purpose. #Mosque46 #NationofIslam #Farrakhan #noisundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To be successful, find a problem and solve it. Look at difficulty as that which will help us to develop our gift and purpose. #Mosque46 #NationofIslam #Farrakhan #noisundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You don't have to be perfect to be an answer someone's prayers. You just have to be willing to do the right thing.  #Mosque46 #NationofIslam  #Farrakhan #noisundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We settle for less than best because we think that we are nothing.  #Mosque46 #NationofIslam  #Farrakhan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surah 23:115 "Then did you think that We created you uselessly and that to Us you would not be returned?" You we were not created in vain.  #Mosque46 #NationofIslam  #Farrakhan @BroWM46<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>When we are quick to cast our people aside and slow to do all we can do to help them overcome their sickness, it’s because of a lack of love and faith in the ability to give life to the dead! #noisundays #mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scholars couldn’t put knowing God and knowing scoundrels and disreputable people together. Jesus didn’t act the way serious religious people acted. They couldn’t figure Him out, but they concluded that He must be as phony as a con man.” #noisundays #mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How can we have the audacity to pick and choose from who is worthy of being rescued from the wickedness of their world? #noisundays #mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The MHEM/HMLF teach us that the lost whom God, the Son of Man seek to save are the Black man and woman in America who are styled as sheep in the Bible. We are lost from God, our way, our morals and knowledge of ourselves!  #noisundays #mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are not here to condemn our people! We are here to teach, resurrect and save them! Our Mission, Spirit and Aim should be the same as the Founder of the Nation of Islam here in America – Master Fard Muhammad, who the MHEM said came to “seek and save that which was lost!”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let us understand the work of a redeemer. The word redeemer is defined by the English dictionary as A person who redeems, especially to buy back, to win or get back. To free or remove from an entanglement or difficulty.   #noisundays #mosque46<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>QUESTION: What are your thoughts about the Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan experience? #Farrakhan #WarningToTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>QUESTION: Do you agree with the @Louis Farrakhan statement that President Trump is a reflection of the ideology that really fuels America?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>QUESTION: What aspects of our thinking and actions as a people we need to change? Why?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Q2: If it is the tradition of God to send “prophets” when society has gone astray and are errant in its actions. Why is it that the majority of the major religious communities do not believe that God has a prophet or Servant of God present today to warn society? #Farrakhan<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>to SEE difficulty properly!! Study Guide #3 Overcoming Difficulty by @LouisFarrakhan helped me to see its DIVINE PURPOSE @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have been touched by such spit, such a teaching. My eyes were open from the words of @LouisFarrakhan that has helped me to see #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The blind man saw men as trees. Meaning deeply rooted institutions that could provide him shelter &amp; subsistence @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus touched him again and helped him to see properly @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The spit comes to from the mouth of Jesus. This is talking about a teaching that gives one PROPER SIGHT @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think this method shows that Jesus uses a method of healing that is strange to this world, that is offensive to this world but it works<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is a deeper meaning to this story. Notice there is NO mentioned of the blind man having an issue with the method @BroWM46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is what stands out to many! Who spits in a person's eyes to heal them. Spitting on people is considered an insult in any society<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus does so in a way that is STRANGE! He spits in the blind man's eyes @BroWM46 #mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go and read Gospel Mark 8:22-26. Jesus helps a man to SEE properly @BroWM46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which means we need an EYE DOCTOR who specializes in helping us see DIFFICULTY properly @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Allah in Quran says He created us to FACE difficulty which is ordained to help us contact God WITHIN! @BroWM46 but MANY don't see it as such<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who do we go to help us address not seeing difficulty properly? @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In closing, when we have issues with our sight we seek someone trained in skill that can help address our physical sight @BroWM46 #mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouisFarrakhan said that its a waste of time to quote victories of prophets over difficulty if it does not motivate us to do the same<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am not lifting up David so we can just admire what he did and leave feeling good about his victories @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What stands on the other side of the difficulty in your marriage, financial trouble or issues in your own spirit? @BroWM46 #mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Between David &amp; God's destiny for him stood Goliath, stood a difficulty!!!! @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If study David we will see what we should do when faced with doubt. Scripture said he IGNORED their doubts @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also when we face difficulty we will also be confronted with doubt inwardly &amp; outwardly. David faced if from family/King Saul @BroWM46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The higher we get up the smaller something looks. Isn't interesting that the word ANT is in the word GIANT.  @BroWM46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tune in NOW to hear this POWERFUL lecture about OVERCOMING difficulty -  https://t.co/KZNrai9d3N<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The word attitude is defined as a manner of disposition or a position toward a thing. The right attitude determines our altitude. @BroWM46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As u read these tweets, how is your attitude about the difficulty in your life RIGHT now? @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouisFarrakhan says that our attitude has the ability to damage our perception of reality! @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The armies and King Saul's fear colored their attitude. @LouisFarrakhan says a weak attitude = a weak Will @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While army was in awe of military prowess of Goliath David saw him as a uncivilized Philistine who insulted God @BroWM46 this is huge!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>David came to serve brothers. Study his response to Goliath? What do we see was different? Difference was David's VIEW @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Goliath challenged them every day for 40 days &amp; everyday they feared. Point: Difficulty we do not confront continues to look insurmountable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Their fear of Goliath caused the extinguishing of their DESIRE. How many of u readin these tweets have allowed difficulty 2 kill your desire<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BroWM46 is talking about how the Army of Israel viewed Goliath! Scripture said they were afraid and lost hope #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now @BroWM46 is asking the listeners to read 1 Samuel 17 about David and Goliath #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If we do not see difficulty properly we will allow it to extinguish what we need to help us to overcome difficutly says @LouisFarrakhan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But if u &amp; I knew we were being forged into a very expensive sword we would SEE the purpose of difficutly @BroWM46 #mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tune in NOW to hear this POWERFUL lecture about OVERCOMING difficulty -  https://t.co/KZNraiqNVl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imagine if u were the piece of steel being hammered by blacksmith &amp; u did not know why? Most of us would complain &amp; try to escape @BroWM46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouisFarrakhan has used the analogy of a blacksmith to point out the purpose of difficulty. Blacksmith is making a precious sword @BroWM46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We will NEVER contact, access or manifest the god within if we do not PROPERLY see difficulty @BroWM46 Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BroWM46 is sharing words of @LouisFarrakhan on the purpose of difficulty which is to bring out the God in us #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The @LouisFarrakhan encourages us to study our inception in the wombs of our mothers to see life has inherent  difficulty @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have to realize that difficulty in our lives does not solely mean punishment or something bad @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The faster we understand the purpose of difficulty, the faster we will stop expecting a life of only ease @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why I pray Allah helps me to do today. Teach you all Islam properly @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The MHEM told @LouisFarrakhan that he sent him to NYC to teach Islam properly which would help believers SOLVE their own problems #Mosque46<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Go check out the powerful message delivered today! #NOISundays  https://t.co/Z2W1qlFsIG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To hear more lectures by our Student Minister visit our Youtube Channel Mosque46av to listen to other lectures #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Men who are without those 5 criteria need remain alone. @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Men who satisfy those 5 criteria are the ones God says are not meant to be alone. @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is he not only a talker of God's word but is he a doer of it? @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can he protect you? Does he make you feel secure? @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He should be able to improve your condition. Can your potential mate do so? @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He should have a vision for what he wants in life. @LouisFarrakhan said thats problem with most bros. have no vision. @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sis make sure brother is in the presence of God. Meaning he has real relationship @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Adam was in presence of God, He had goals/vision, he cultivated, he protected and he had God's word @BroWM46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To sisters go and study what Allah did for Adam in Genesis @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FOI I would point you to @LouisFarrakhan article Allah's Choice of Jesus read 1st paragraph. He gives guidance @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Major question courting couples ask is how do they know if the person is the one @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But u don't want to do that but u instead just like all of his post, pics etc hoping he gets hint! are just flirt @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Courtship is NOT marriage!!! U are not asking to marry a brother if  u submit a request @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Much of the rejection to that idea is fear of rejection &amp; misunderstanding of courtship process @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plus @LouisFarrakhan said that a sister can in the Courtship Manual @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know I have heard the reasons. Sis shouldn't pursue brothers. U are not pursing a brother when you submit a request @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Courtship is not u pursuing a bro its the proper way to engage in dialogue to see if there is compatibility @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sisters instead of flirting on the slick, being overly nice to a brother why not just submit a request @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FOI/MGT should not entertain bro/sis trying to approach them outside of the courtship process @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When we approach courtship as an Islamic version of boyfriend/girlfriend we take away from process @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The courtship process doesn't leave one wondering what end destination is @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouisFarrakhan says most important part of marriage is the approach, more so than the marriage @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now @BroWM46 is talking about courtships. Animals/insects have system to select a partner. How can we as humans not? @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The behaviors we fail to address as a single can potentially ruin our marriages @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a single person u must realize that your marriage will only be as good as the work u do on yourself @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you knew all that you know about you as a single person would u marry u? @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BroWM46 is now talking to singles. #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not dedicating proper quality time with spouse causes marriage to die @LouisFarrakhan @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our duty to our spouses is also part of our duty to Allah! @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are not listening to each other so we don't know each others needs @LouisFarrakhan @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every marriage goes through storms @LouisFarrakhan @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Success of marriage is not solely based on love. But rather duty @LouisFarrakhan @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tough times in marriage provide us with opportunity to prove our love &amp; our word @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>View @LouisFarrakhan lecture How to Heal a Brokenheart! @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To those who have been divorce don't let it sour you and turn you away from future possibilities @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Divorce breaks hearts/crushed spirits! But Allah says He heals broken hearts in Luke 4:18. Know He can heal your heart @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BroWM46 is now quoting words by @LouisFarrakhan for guidance to married couples #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most treat their former spouse as if they are an enemy &amp; don't adhere to guidance of the Holy Quran @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Read @LouisFarrakhan article about Allah Hating Divorce! He gives us guidance on how we should handle a divorce @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When we do divorce we must maintain our integrity and do the process in a way that does not conflict with our faith @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As married couples we need to be on the lookout for that which threatens our marriages. @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So we must put on the armour of God. Notice scripture says we MUST put on the armour of God. No 1 will put it on 4 us. @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the Bible the word for divorce comes from same word for apostate which means to defect. @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My mate isn't this or that! But real reasons is bcuz they are tired of living the faith. Divorce is an out! @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Their faithful mate reminds them of a lifestyle they want to leave. So they come up with justifications for divorce @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes divorce is inspired by one spouse's desire to return to the world @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1 of the other negative impacts of divorce is that we lose 1 or both of the believers. @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Divorce is painful! It negatively impacts the atmosphere of the mosque. News of failed marriages saddens believers @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>also to study the causes of divorce and make sure that the thoughts &amp; behaviors don't exist in us @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>should know about stat for the purpose to know that we live in an environment that is hostile to marriage @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Single, courting &amp; married couples need to be aware of the 50% divorce rate in U.S. Not to be afraid of it. @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BroWM46 is talking about divorce first since he did not get a chance to speak on during part one. #NOISundays<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>World wants us to divorce/defect. When we do Satan wins. Satan's 1st attack was on family in Book of Genesis @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Defect is a term used in relations with a military solider. This world is at war with marriage bcuz its at war with God @BroWM46 #NOISundays<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Just posted a photo  https://t.co/4SAUcj6h0U<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tomorrow!!!!! #Mosque46  https://t.co/Os9ReQPcSM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The answer is found in Luke 4:18. THIS Jesus @LouisFarrakhan   heals broken hearts! #Mosque46 @BroWM46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Divorce is so painful that people often lose faith. I have noticed how we lose a believer or both after a divorce @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go order @LouisFarrakhan lectures on how to mend a broken heart!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you are divorced know that there is LIFE after it! @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not talking about physical heart! That's a sign. Broken heart means life force has been sucked out of us! Our spirit. @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go read Proverbs 18:14 @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Divorce breaks the heart of he/she that goes through it! @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BroWM46 is quoting how Allah in Quran says about how divorce should be properly handled #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BroWM46 is talking about what @LouisFarrakhan says about what should happen before a divorce is decided #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why scripture says PUT on the full armour of God. Notice it says WE have to put on the full amour of God. No mystery god! @BroWM46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not that marriage itself is a war, but this tells us that marriage is under attack as we pointed out in beginning @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BroWM46 is reading from and encouraging people to go read @LouisFarrakhan article Allah Hates Divorce #mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In Bible the word for divorce is connected to apostate. It means to defect! Soldiers defect. Marriage is a military unit, war is involved<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Single/courting &amp; married couples need to know this stat! Not out of fear but to be proactive We can begin to prepare ourselves against them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Divorce rate in America is 50%! @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BroWM46 is dealing with divorce #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We must remember what @LouisFarrakhan said about difficulty of marriage. 2nd only to self-creation of Allah! @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We MUST remember that difficulties in marriage or only moments in the journey. If we don't address them they become permanent @BroWM46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As married couples we have to remember that difficulty is INHERENT in the process! @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Arrogance, old hurts, feeling of lack of reciprocity &amp; needs not being articulated clearly are some of reasons that prevent us @BroWM46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BroWM46 is now speaking on 4 obstacles that prevent us from satisfying our needs #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our natures are different. This is why you need to hear what @LouisFarrakhan teaches about the differences in men/women #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>women need to know they are loved and valued! Men need to know that we are respected @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We need to know what are the needs of our spouse and how we can best satisfy them @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How can we say we are dutiful to God but neglect the 1 who is part of the process that helps us to become 1 with God? @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BroWM46 points audience to the Ephesians 5:21-34 to show that duty to mate is part of our duty to Allah and His Christ #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember @LouisFarrakhan says that LOVE is DUTY and DUTY breeds LOVE @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some like to hide their neglect of their spouse behind their "duty" to Allah! Duty to your spouse is being dutiful to Allah! @BroWM46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Complacency is a threat to marriage. @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1 problem in marriage is we stop doing those things that made the person fall in love in the beginning @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some in NOI are not following the process right but expecting the results. When they don't they blame the process instead of their deviation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now @BroWM46 is dealing on marriage and what causes some to fail. #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BroWM46 is explaining how he credits his 17 year marriage due to him following the principles of courtship #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When we see it as a boy/girlfriend thing we forsake the critical analysis that courtship requires. Only ask superficial questions @BroWM46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Courtship has become an Islamic way to say I have a boyfriend/girlfriend. This interferes with the courtship process. @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unfortunately some in the NOI are now bringing worldly practices into the process of courtship @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too many women are getting hurt today because they enter relationships now knowing the end game! Courtship done right prevents that @BroWM46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The ultimate aim of courtship is to make a decision on if I will marry this person. This is not like dating. A date always changes! @BroWM46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The courtship process is the medicine to heal the damage of the slavemaster denying us the science of mating! @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Study nature. The smallest to largest animal has a PROCESS by which they select a mate! Why don't we as human beings? @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tune in to hear this lecture! Its live on FB right now! Go there and google Willie Muhammad #Mosque46  https://t.co/eynnimnPe9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now @BroWM46 is talking about courtship. #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the better job we do at working on ourselves as a single person the clear of an idea we have of what kind of mate we need @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouisFarrakhan talks about how physical attraction is what begins the process of marriage. So appearance matters. #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Use this single time to work on improving your physical appearance. Go to gym, get serious about how to eat to live @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Use this time single  to grow! LISTEN to ALL lectures by @LouisFarrakhan on relationships, courtships, marriages @BroWM46 #mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Use this time as a single person to learn and develop skills that help increase success of a marriages @BroWM46 #mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We spend less time in grocery store when we know what we want. Spent less time in relationships or courtships when we know what we want<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While single you need to begin to write down what qualities you want in a mate and why. Compares this to grocery shopping. @BroWM46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>relationship choices. Yes, our relationship with parents influences our mate selection @BroWM46 #mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BroWM46 encouraging single people to examine relationships with parents. Quotes article that shows how it influences future #mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BroWM46 is referencing an activity that single people can do from his book   https://t.co/ssNmAFnoqW  #mosque46 @BroWM46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Use this time to rid yourself of the negative beliefs about love, marriage, relationships &amp; YOURSELF! @BroWM46 #mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Use time as a single person to better yourself. Don't fear being alone! Doing causes 1 to enter relationships out of haste @BroWM46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BroWM46 is beginning to share guidance to singles people from @LouisFarrakhan #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BroWM46 says this is why Self-Improvement Study Guides are important to singles, married, courting &amp; divorced #mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ex. Money Issues, Poor Communication &amp; Lack of Commitment all are issues we have when single @BroWM46 #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lesson in Genesis &amp; Problem Book is that a corrupted/broken family breeds a corrupted/broken Nation @BroWM46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BroWM46 many of the problems that suck life out of marriage begins before we are even married! We BRING them! #mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tells Believers to look at Problem Book. 1st two problems deal with a husband &amp; wife @BroWM46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After that attack all hell breaks out in the Bible thereafter @BroWM46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Marriage &amp; family was the FIRST target of the devil! See Book of Genesis @BroWM46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>decided to do this lecture again bcuz @LouisFarrakhan said I want to see successful marriage in the Nation of Islam and among Black people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>but nothing is more important or sacred than family and the cornerstone of family, which is marriage. @LouisFarrakhan said @BroWM46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We can talk about many things that are important in life says @LouisFarrakhan quoted by @BroWM46<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>All interested in acquiring this lecture can reach out to us! #NOISUNDAYS #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BroWM46 is closing out by giving the audience pointers on what we all can do to develop quality of humility #NOISUNDAYS #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BroWM46 is quoting @LouisFarrakhan words from social media explaining what allows him to not respond back to attacks #NOISUNDAYS #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouisFarrakhan is a man we can study to learn how to develop quality of humility #NOISUNDAYS #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouisFarrakhan humility is one of the reasons he is the LAST ONE STANDING! @BroWM46 #NOISUNDAYS #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The root of the hardness of the Son of Man is his LOVE! @BroWM46 that is @LouisFarrakhan #NOISUNDAYS #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BroWM46 is quoting Ezekiel 3 that speaks about Son of Man being made to withstand the rebellion of the people #NOISUNDAYS #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BroWM46 is quoting Ezekiel 2 showing the kind of people @LouisFarrakhan has been sent to work with #NOISUNDAYS #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouisFarrakhan whose love for us as a people is greater than our own hatred of self, vanity and rebellion! #NOISUNDAYS #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But we should thank Allah for placing @LouisFarrakhan in our midst! A man not motivated by vanity but LOVE #NOISUNDAYS #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When this leadership ego is bruised they call those whom they are to serve N***gs #NOISUNDAYS #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The MHEM was told by his teacher by his Teacher to TAKE PLENTY #NOISUNDAYS #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An indicator to show that their leadership is vain and level of love is low is their inability to take plenty #NOISUNDAYS #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This kind of leadership is starved for ego gratification #NOISUNDAYS #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If we listen to them we can hear it in their talk. "I did this, I did that, this would not exist if so was not here" #NOISUNDAYS #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They posses some knowledge and an ability to speak. Yet they are moved by vanity! #NOISUNDAYS #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In this day of social media we are seeing an emergence of people who desire to be leaders amongst our people #NOISUNDAYS #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ALL of us must master the urges to be vain, if not it will lead to our downfall @BroWM46 #NOISUNDAYS #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have to be very careful in this age of social media.Despite its great benefit it also can feed our vanity @BroWM46  #NOISUNDAYS #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouisFarrakhan said what we do is limited by why we do it #NOISUNDAYS #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Reason why it doesn't last is because the motive isn't right @BroWM46 #NOISUNDAYS #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Leadership that is founded in those characteristics do not last long @BroWM46 #NOISUNDAYS #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many today are relying on arrogance and vanity to propel themselves into leadership @BroWM46 #NOISUNDAYS #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The characteristic of humility is really the key to proper success. @BroWM46 #NOISUNDAYS #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Humility is the quality or condition of being humble &amp;a not unpretentious, unassuming and submissive. @LouisFarrakhan #NOISUNDAYS #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Leaders of Fortune 500 companies are beginning to look for characteristic of humility in future execs #NOISUNDAYS #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouisFarrakhan said Our experience as slaves has made us look at humility and meekness as weakness. #NOISUNDAYS #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Due to living in a world of vanity and arrogance humility is viewed as weak.  #NOISUNDAYS #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BroWM46 is speaking on the topic of the Rare Gift of Humility which is inspired by words of @LouisFarrakhan #NOISUNDAYS #Mosque46<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We would like to welcome you to @Mosque46 #NOISUNDAYS #Mosque46<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GranspearZX @TalibKweli @YouTube that CNN segment was embarrassing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come hear Brother Lawrence  https://t.co/5tjZgpg3Vd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viznix @TalibKweli so does that mean when you rap along you say the N-Word? Be honest. We can't have a discussion if you won't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalibKweli work on getting the rest to stop saying it. First by stopping yourself. Conscious only in name.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalibKweli you good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalibKweli was being sarcastic. You understand what you want to. And ignore what you want to as well. As long as they cheer you on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalibKweli I'm not ignoring them. There are a few. Why you trying to act like you don't have white fans who use the N-Word?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalibKweli racism isn't the only issue in the world. But hey your fans don't say it. You like a Jedi Rapper. Laugh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalibKweli I can see u at shows now. "Hip-Hop is participatory! Hey white fans please remember not to say N-word! Only blacks can!" Plz!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalibKweli great fans. 😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalibKweli real fans listen to your lyrics but don't rap the N-Word huh?😂 I guess they skip over other profanities as well. You have some<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalibKweli Deflection as usual. Ignore the question/point and bring up something you fail at trying to argue in the past.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalibKweli It ain't just a them. You need correction as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalibKweli but oh,the ones that do are not your fans. Really? Man please. SMH.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalibKweli we're there in line when you were here in New Orleans. They were rapping them lyrics right along with you as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalibKweli laughing. First you said it didn't happened. Then when that was proved otherwise they are not your fans. Well they showed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalibKweli now the video TMZ. They showed knew those lyrics to State of Grace. I saw it personally and videos show it too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalibKweli fam their are people in their repeating your word for word. SmH.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalibKweli don't discount what I saw either. Trust brother they do. Next time I'll video it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalibKweli believe that if you want to. I have seen them NOT mute it. Keep believing that if you want to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalibKweli they are rapping along. I guess they stop on that point. Yeah right.  https://t.co/COzZjUz3BE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cee4our so what do you do when you are rapping his songs when the N-Word is used by him?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalibKweli enables them. If you don't just say it. I guest your white fans mute themselves when it gets to those verses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalibKweli State of Grace! Come on brother. There are videos performing in Europe saying N-Word. Obviously you don't believe your usage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalibKweli I have been to your concerts. I have seen hundreds white fans saying it when you do. Does that mean you enable them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalibKweli so does your use of N word enable your white fans to feel free to use it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalibKweli no. U mentioned in an earlier tweet how U feel his words enable Nazis. Does your use of the N word do the same?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalibKweli does your use of the N-word enable nazis, white supremacists and its continued use by young whites and blacks?<|endoftext|>
