<|startoftext|>"Dont kneel and pray, donate $6.66 today!" That made me laugh! But people now days are either going to laugh like me, or freak out unnecessarily (most likely) ‘Sit on Satan’s Lap’ fundraising event draws different reactions  https://t.co/1CzEl3TqIT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@post_offensive @the_field_doc Wait seriously? Cause I pretty much carry somewhat of the same items. Sorry for my ignorance on the matter<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>How come it's always the people that can afford to buy the stuff, always get it for free? I see these posts of people with everything getting everything just sent to them. I mean I get how its promoting/advertising but damn....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheCondomFish Does the pants still on one leg count?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtrlPew @TheAKGuy Fair reply. Unfortunately I dont have a computer at this time. Or a printer. Nore do I have the intelligence to do so if I did. So I'll just shut up now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr Preach bro!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jcorriv35 Can only afford one. Not both!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtrlPew @TheAKGuy I wanna see a bacon wrap holder!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr I'm taking a wild guess and say the order came up 5 times? Like they ended up making it 5 times only git paid for 1? No clue. Asian places I go to dont even talk. Just point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr Honestly didnt even know it was gonna snow! Just walked out to throw the trash and there it was. Hope it's still coming when I get off...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The_Poying It's like notches on a bed...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McDonalds The pumpkin pies you stole away from me too soon??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>See perfect weather for dashing, snowing in the desert. And I'm stuck at regular job<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@000_three Umbrella Corp.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@themasterdasher Side hustle that pays more bills then my full time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Inarush1996 I still have my original!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@freegunzone First of all.... he totally shot first.   Secondly, not usually a fan of the style but that is down right clean looking badassery.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr @the_giglebowski @t_xu I've only been doin this a short time compared to alot of you. I am already at almost 600 delivered though. I bust my ass! I worked 56+ hours dashing last week alone. In top of my regular job<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr @the_giglebowski Sarcastic much?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@the_giglebowski One of those times i wish I had money<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CashApp My notis never seem to work correctly. Maybe it's my phone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeannemstevens  https://t.co/hiGLS5CvWq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HiddenCash Sometimes you do something that's not even that great, but in a world full of assholes, the smallest considerations of another person can mean the biggest of differences.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DashBridges I'm jelly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All the room on the other side and this bitch cant even park in the lines. I dont care what your line of work is, your not privileged to park like a dumbass.  https://t.co/kCqbbr9ljH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lisa602 On decline #6 already...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Doordash #Delivery Tip of the day- Gas stations are a good spot to grab extra straws and drink carriers. You never know when they might come in handy when picking up and they are either forgotten or out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seen any custom plates today?  https://t.co/228kI3KLYR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr I have a few places but damn not like that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr Dude.... trade me areas please<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Week ass night for dashes.... scheduled all day tomorrow. After tonight, hopefully I can make something throughout tomorrow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DNPthree @JaredFPS Never says I have any entries? Why is that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr It ain't horrible. Beats some things people have done for less!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr This one is on chewing tobacco, and if I do the whole thing (5 weeks at like an hour or two a week) they will pay $1075. $75 first time, $200 each time after<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GFuelEnergy I'll take one please!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr Oh hell no I'll run man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr Right. Need that yesterday. I'm actually signing up for a clinical study to try and bring in some extra cash...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoShoutoutGamer @McDonalds Dude this holiday pies are good but they ran out at every location here in like 2 days... its dumb!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does apple have H1 chips (2) in their Airpod Max headphones?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is actually pretty awesome! Not trying to be an ad but I honestly respect this. Just random how I came across it but #respect  #Cooking #foodie #imhungry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HiddenCash Exactly the thing in which we dont think it is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Started off making $60 in just over an hour, and now haven't had a dash worth seriously taking in over 2 hours. What the hell is going on here!?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@the_giglebowski @DlvryDryvr Interesting. Kinda wanna try it but at same time dont haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr @the_giglebowski What is zax sauce??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HiddenCash I think I said it already but just in case Ace if Spades<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pollux2789 Challenge accepted! Do enough dashes to need that much gas in a week!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The_Poying I did but then she after that I but totally together didnt at all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr Man I wanna dash in your area. People around here are just assholes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr Ya but appreciation and pride are dying with the new generations. No one cares but for themselves and how to cut corners to get ahead of the next guy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr Dont get me wrong, I'm not trying to hate on homeless people. But these people talking about "easy money" and then talking shit on the Walmart workers, as they stand there looking like that, just sits the wrong way with me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr I mean I get comfy, but personally I would prefer my stuff being dropped off by someone who doesn't look homeless. Am I out of line?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So even tho I was short from the goal I had set for myself, guess I still did pretty good. Sadly pretty good isn't good enough!!! TRY HARDER DAMN IT  https://t.co/PlHnNYAZdP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QueenieKris Discovery Zone/Planet Fun<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr Haha next time then!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr Haha if I had it I woulda. Just ended up cashing in so i could get some gas. Oh well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HiddenCash Ace of Spades!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mivhellv Right this second, gas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Catch 22. Gas light came on. I want to keep dashing to hit my goal I needed to hit today, but I would have to cash out in order to get gas, which then I couldnt cash out again if I made it to my goal... damn it. Well... shit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Griffiiisu @Pollux2789 I havent even checked i will here in a bit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EntreCourier Thank you. Very VERY detailed and informative<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cllickss No... what's it feel like?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FenixAmmunition *Drops the mic*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DriversAmerican Report it to DD and they'll give you another $5 for that 30 minutes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steak31018980 @jeannemstevens Computer wise? A broken desktop that doesnt work from like 2006<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Steak31018980 @jeannemstevens I'll gladly take that over what I currently have!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What kinda car you think this family will get next?  https://t.co/g53RJjr6t0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DriversAmerican Oh snap!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Take10Trivia Maybe a dumb question, sorry if it is, but when is the winner going to be announced?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I just learned that for every 30 minutes you wait for an order DD will add $5. Had  3x orders at Walmart for $15 total (Trust I didnt want too but) waited 35 minutes. Made $5 per order for wait. So 1 hour =$30. Not horrible if you bring ur Nintendo switch  https://t.co/ffNiHxHB5G<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@s8nstan But... just trying to help you out! Keeping it fresh with new faces all the time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Take10Trivia Oh man that's a tuff one. Are the clothes just a little big if I chose the most comfy sleep gear? Cause man some billion thread count sheets would be some seriously awesome comfyness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jcorriv35 Was that a thing in like the late 80s early 90s right? I'm trying to remember. I mean I remember seeing them in commercials in the 90s still<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jcorriv35 I got a key chain and sheets that match that haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The standard dasher attire around here is apparently the "I just got out of bed" look. Like come on people, have a little tact. These are some of the better dressed ones too  https://t.co/JoHiekz3xN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pollux2789 Oh got ya. ok makes sense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pollux2789 I mean I have unlimited data on my plan, but I mean I can show how many hours I am actively dashing pretty easily<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is a new phone a write off come taxes? I mean I use it non stop for working?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr Sorry for crappy quality. Had to zoom in alot and phones all broke as shit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At first I was confused by the donuts but then I looked harder and figured out what was goin on! @DlvryDryvr it's made up of sweets!  https://t.co/H5Q2uxpmDV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr I've honestly never used the customer side of it. I mean I get what you mean tho. But ya I never use it. Ever haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HypeHondas These pictures actually<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alright off to an hour late start, but gotta work to make up for shitty yesterday. Todays goal. $240. #HustleEveryday<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Creepy ass prize in the claw game... WTF ??  https://t.co/2PQHkaPxqm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BDG_JB I need one cause all I do is work to keep us afloat and still cant afford one if I could even find one. But having it to play and take my mind off how crappy everything else is would be amazing<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr You said ZJ and I'll I could think of is "if you have to ask, you can't afford it" Haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr My favorite is when they got no mailbox, no curb numbers, the porch lights are off, and they reply "look for numbers on house "... you mean the ones behind your Bush that's out of one of Ron Jeremy's films in the 80s? Dumbass people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woke up to it snowing. So hopefully there will be some good #DashingInDecember to go with all the dumbass drivers that come out.   "I got 4x4 so I can haul ass!" -every idiot where i live<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DexertoIntel Wish I could play it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gare_ted Is there supposed to be more? Wait booze!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryVeteran_ Your missing Die Hard man....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@P2BrzL @behindthesceans @PostMindBlowing Will smith?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr What does it even mean!?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtrlPew Oooooooooo. I want one!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr That or a Chevy. Hard to tell. The sound when it hit was freaking solid! I'm guessing the old dude in the truck blew the stop sign. That's how my prelude got totaled. Old couple blowing  stop sign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr That's the only one I saw happen. I was down the street at the intersection, heard it, looked up in time to see it finish landing on the side. Then went right by it  https://t.co/SNiOkrLVSq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Inarush1996 I'm trying! Thanks, you too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe dashing is a bad idea tonight. 3 accidents within a half mile.  https://t.co/wliYEJSOFN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jcorriv35 A ford<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I definitely put in some time over the weekend...  https://t.co/kgQNf2SpS9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BananasRama  @KingsRuthless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtrlPew Man I want a printer so bad! Oh wait, i need a computer first....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DNPthree #FreePS5Monday  Holy crap that special edition one looks soooooo awesome  $tex1E37<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@this_dash @DoorDash Ya I seen a bunch of $3 ones... even a $2.75!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DriversAmerican Tomorrow I have my brewery job. I mean dont get me wrong, I'm scheduled to work tomorrow soon as I'm off from that, but $200 might not be feasible. I can hope though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amiraliR1 Haha fantastic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dave4977 @brian4NY @GrantB911 @GovMurphy Agreed. Just unneccessary no matter what. Like really wanting them to wat and where a mask at the same time or what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Took me the entire weekend. But I'm officially not in the negative now....it sucks that I busted my ass, made $400, just to get back to zero...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pfunk2300000 @DriversAmerican Albuquerque, NM. I wish it was that good here. I gotta put in seriousl work to make what I need<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr That's so bad!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pfunk2300000 Nope. Virgin bag. Or saying you never have?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr Everyone should just know not to do that ha! But no. I was the only customer there for like 10 min too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr No clue. Was at a place picking up and order and it was all alone!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr Haha. I havent had that yet... I mean its only a matter of time though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uh oh... someone forgot their hot bag.... #bad #dasher  https://t.co/Brkr04MWvD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So taking a short break. Today is definitely not as good as yesterday, at $108 for the day so far. $100 more to go. So hope the dinner rush comes in hot!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewBCole @DlvryDryvr I'll keep checking then. Cause having better back ups would help me a ton!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jcorriv35 Ya that's like my parents. They live in south dakota so they always have snow!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HiddenCash It's like a crab cake but with an egg.?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jcorriv35 It never really happens here so it would be a nice change! If we get snow it melts by noon usually<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wrexham_gamer Haha. Still. Would be nice to have one. Hell I really just want cold war for PS4 and I would be happy. To go back to when I didnt work my ass off to pay bills would be blissful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmm..... #scam ??? Has to be. Too good to be true  https://t.co/vu6z0q6Xf6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jcorriv35 I'm trying to figure out if these clouds here will give us a little of that  https://t.co/v2BAa6IFSW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewBCole @DlvryDryvr Both those actually. I dont think it told me a specific time just said on a list<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is it labeled "DIET KIT" not dinner kit or utensils??  https://t.co/4N4ldCZv64<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewBCole @DlvryDryvr I need to get the others but they are "on a wait list" to get on them they tell me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blckriflecoffee @SuperHeroNexus People really quick to jump to conclusions these days. Does anyone actually research anything before telling everyone about it and their opinions?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JewishRedditor I feel like a mortal kombat character<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JewishRedditor Shit I do that.... I just have to have it on all the time so just end up leaving it on. Hell I get home and still have it on sometimes. Like when you wear sunglasses all day and forget they are there....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@catlyncrespo What's snapchat?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewBCole @the_giglebowski I get it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewBCole @the_giglebowski Cant blame yourself though. That helps no one. It's sad. But it's where we are it in the world sadly. Least in my opinion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HogDexter Almost used this one instead actually ha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jcorriv35 Hell if I ever can get a new not a used car in general I'll count that as a win!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HogDexter  https://t.co/vxyffHcyxT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jcorriv35 Right! Good to know I'll never be able to afford it. Ha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WashlngtonNFL @Frankie_Knuckl I appreciate you guys for the chance to win!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattGoesBuck 3D print that shit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@the_giglebowski I feel it's ok to pay respect still in your own way even if it sucks to not go<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jcorriv35 Hell ya. Too bad it's not just trying to get paid. Its what I need to make ro pay bills<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I pray there are mo crashes in the dash today... gotta get that money. HAVE TO MAKE IT!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jcorriv35 Ouch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well slow start this morning so far. No many dashes coming in. Gotta get that $200! LET'S DO THIS !!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Exellion_ Duh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr Right! Kills me it was down for like 2 hours. I coulda made probably another $50 easy if it wasn't!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well.... I've officially hit $200 for the day dashing.... sadly need to do that again tomorrow in order to stay afloat. Sure feels like I'm drowning...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr All. The. Time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@the_giglebowski I usually dont unless it's super easy and quick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@the_giglebowski Instead I'm getting screwed on tios cause all the customers are mad from waiting...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@milkiemouse Wrap it like a present<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DriversAmerican My phones getting a ton of texts after restarting and still not able to accept anything through app<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DriversAmerican I just tried that as well and still no luck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DriversAmerican It's not really tho. I keep getting the texts to pick up, but nothing in the app to accept....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoorDash_Help keep getting these messages and nothing I can do about it. I dont want to lose my time slot though  https://t.co/TlfNrJC8hi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr I did finish it ya. And now they send me this...  https://t.co/HZwbTpJKiw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr Cant sign in or anything  https://t.co/Cg40DGODSQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr Its started scewing up in the middle of my last order then about 15-20 minutes ago it completely crashed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr Fuck me too. I need this to not be happening.  Please dont let this last long... I HAVE TOO make this money or I'm screwed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevieJPN It's like when I deliver to the million dollar homes and they dont tip. They can afford it because they do that kinda stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pulte I mean I didnt help. If I could I would.  But I'm one of the ones on the side of the spectrum that isn't as warm and fuzzy feeling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DriversAmerican Hell most the places around here are late with their orders anyway. I'm always early never late so sadly always waiting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DriversAmerican Oooo. Imagine if it did have a benefit  though. Like gave priority....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On average as a #delivery #driver you drive how many miles (or kilometers) per week?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UberFacts What if most people are just quoting Tommy Boy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrowYourSocials @vipgameio Good luck to all. I know alot of us out here right now could really make this go a long way to help out with necessities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarthaH04086421 @pulte Least yours is in the positive!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoShoutoutGamer Cause most people, sadly, are very stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr #tryandtakeit  Protected delivery service here #Ruger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pulte Every bit helps, specifically when helps people help themselves. Gas money for instance. $5 worth of gas could help someone like me to go work to make enough to get groceries to help feed the six mouths in our house $tex1E37<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Talking to a manager of a restaurant I pick up from alot dashing, he said he was gonna give me a "thumbs up" is there any advantage of him doing that for me from the restaurants side of the app?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you choose contactless delivery and to have us call when we drop off, then dont get mad when we call... now I'm probably not gonna get a tip cause they were too stupid to fill out their own requests correctly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr I feel ya man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pulte I'm out here working as hard as I can on second job to make ends! $tex1E37<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr They gonna cancel the order?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr Haha well if Wendy's would hurry the hell up I wouldn't be on here! And I made sure to leave the switch at home!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr Good advice! That's what I'm trying to do. Avoiding these damn Walmart ones that keep coming up. If I get stuck in a slow down I might have to take some if they aren't horrible and aren't where I have to go inside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well in order to not get further in debt I'll have to make just under $400 this weekend so I'm scheduled from now till 1:00 am today to dash... hoping for the best<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TurboDodson Still jealous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pulte #twitterturkeydrive $tex1E37<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pulte $tex1E37<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RESPAWNProducts Wait what<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KEEMSTAR What are my chances? Slim to none? Or less then that?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr Haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@milkiemouse I'll do my best! Keep on keepin on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@milkiemouse How ya been? Rough times we living in no doubt! Ya was just curious cause I've been doin it lately and hadnt heard of anyone losing it unless they really screwed up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jchorp @UberFacts Nailed it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am also in the damn parking lot of said restaurant so...ya I call bullshit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for literally giving me 3 seconds before saying I missed it... #thisshitbroken  https://t.co/sV7E99U8Cl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DriversAmerican @DoorDash Took the food another 25 minutes after talking to them to be ready. BWW is horrible. I try to avoid. But I take what I can get right now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KEEMSTAR This is the shit I like to see!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@milkiemouse How did you lose your doordash job? If you dont mind me asking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This human sized uncircumcised penis literally ran to cut infront of me in line...slid in when I was opening the door to get infront. Like really? Grown ass penis of a man  https://t.co/aDL1XfdkjV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xoxabstract I'm right here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@themasterdasher It's less then or right around $9.50 here. Albuquerque, New Mexico<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skywlka22 @snkr_twitr I see it as top or bottom? Or you mean. The shoes!?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pulte I'd be happy with just a cornish hen...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pulte I got them on. They never work. But they on<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PulpNews And I thought this stuff couldnt get any dumber, then SURPRISE!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustJonna69 @krqe Right! I read it a few times to make sure I wasnt seeing it wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IllusionOG -4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KEEMSTAR Sometimes I see exactly where your coming from<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustJonna69 @krqe Way to proof read the article guys!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustJonna69 @krqe I was about to post that too haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IllusionOG A break from always working but still never being caught up on bills.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UberFacts How many were car accidents that hit labeled covid tho?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BananasRama @JoeBiden What if I just didn't<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamaninventor @DriversAmerican Well shit.... ha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone else use the Stride app to check miles? And if so notice it doesnt stop even if you tell it to from tool bar, only if you fully open the app will it turn off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr @the_giglebowski That doesnt sound good at all!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrantB911 No one tried to stop them? They seriously grab their shit and just walk alway like that? Just...wow...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Xfinity Oh yay! I was looking for a way to lower my IQ this evening!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Driftingdream1 @HypeHondas AGREED<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Inarush1996 @Attach I'm right there with you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jcorriv35 I would say accord over civic but jetta?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DriversAmerican Just a few months. Not as long as some people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DriversAmerican  https://t.co/SYgZyJZ6Pp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jcorriv35 I saved those pics too....  https://t.co/hfS3a0vqP3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pulte Damn that's lucky<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@themasterdasher Even 10 an hour is better then nothin if you really need money.  Beggars cant be choosers!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@the_giglebowski I havent had a free food from a screw up in so long! I'm jealous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KEEMSTAR Dont worry I feel you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pulte That's groceries for a few months as well as dog food for my fur babies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pulte Ya that would help alot in alot of ways<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoorDash_Help seriously what is going on? Wont let me dash at all even though it's just came up as busy. What's going on? Last night having no dashes coming up for me  now this???  https://t.co/kT0Uponip4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Driftingdream1 @HypeHondas Ya, dog hates car rides now, and car that had thousands put into it was only worth $3k from insurance. So it was heartbreaking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Driftingdream1 @HypeHondas Got Tboned by some stupid couple running a stop sign. Ended up in a wall and totaled<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HypeHondas Brings back memories of my baby before she got taken from me... man I miss her  https://t.co/6M6tMUfx3p<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr @DoorDash_Help Would make more sense!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr @DoorDash_Help It's like gas station and walgreens snacks and small munchie orders and such<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr @DoorDash_Help Unfortunately I dont have UE. Just this, gopuff, and instacart<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr I'll try it. I've even force stopped the app and stuff like that. The dash gods are hating me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr @DoorDash_Help Its killing me. I've seriously got one dash in last almost 2 hours. It was super short but still only $4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel that #doordash is scolding me for hating on the Walmart dashes I wouldnt take or something. I'm not getting anything tonight... literally nothing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BananasRama @TeaWap I dunno. I REALLY liked it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I unassigned a dash cause I waited 25 minutes past when it was supposed to be ready and got sick of waiting. Now zero dashes coming up even tho its "busy " what's going on? @DoorDash_Help<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtrlPew Oh man that green has my name all over it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McDonalds When you actually fried the apple pies...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Off from brewery job... TINE TO DASH! Dash Gods, please let have a decent night, I would really like to maybe make enough tonight to be able to relax tomorrow, as well as be able to afford to purchase #ColdWar  Please and Thank you, Your avid disciple/follower<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@the_giglebowski #Respect<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@the_giglebowski Ya that's some crap. I'm not saying no 15% but come on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheCondomFish I mean I don't got a grill but I turn over a shopping cart. Same thing ya?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RESPAWNProducts Then why can I comment??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr I'm old<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any platform is fine by me. Long as it's not the newest ones!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh yup it does mean 11 years. Holy shit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you remember when you joined Twitter? I do! #MyTwitterAnniversary  Does the 11 mean.... what does it mean?  https://t.co/V8oqk0A4ST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KEEMSTAR I would do absolutely nothing except be entirely grateful and possibly send one of those Thann you cards my mom used to make me do. But this time would truly mean every word of it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshLun40901950 @krqe Trying to make a profit I see...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@krqe Better have a shit ton of groceries to make it even close to remotely fair.  Have to see some steak and lobster with a good scotch to make it worth the while  and even then.... ya....no<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HughAkston0 @krqe ☝️☝️☝️ This makes a hell of alot more sense and more beneficial to all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BananasRama Dick move bro.  I'll be over here trying to drown myself with my own tears.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BananasRama For real man. Shits depressing as hell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BDG_JB I would love this! Getting down to it is I flat out cant afford anything right now. Bills, dog food, and people food are more priority then gaming as sad as it is. Not that I dont game anymore, just money gets spent elsewhere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RESPAWNProducts All the above<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryVeteran_ I like it cause I can use my chest conceale carry without getting overheated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dupritos Thread the needle While playing frogger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doordash does me hitting the "I dont want to go to this store" make that store automatically pop up 10 more times? It sure seems like it right now...  https://t.co/QBkhHh5gnT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cleflore23 Wow.... like seriously lost so much money on that. And then the cops are just going to auction them for a profit watch...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiscountLasers @Exellion_ I wish I had mine. I was looking for the psp version fir a while but no luck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidavakian0 @CashApp I'd take it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CashApp I dont see nothing live on...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidavakian0 @CashApp Right!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HiddenCash Hell no!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HiddenCash Haha I wish I could make a living off it. Only made 5 bucks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HiddenCash Sugar Flour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RESPAWNProducts I really want to be able to play it...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been using my #NintendoSwitch alot lately, waiting for dashes and what not, trying to make money, and some how my Zelda Breath of the Wild cartridge vanished.... fuck me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CyberpunkGame Were only a couple months apart!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sonofzion777 @Exellion_ Or counter strike<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sonofzion777 @Exellion_ Rainbow Six?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Exellion_ Oh times were so much simpler when gaming started for me so long ago!  Anyone remember Tenchu? Got it used on a whim for like $5 so long ago. Some of the best money I ever spent.  https://t.co/AuJlhBFfWk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can everyone stop posting all this awesome #ColdWar #CallofDuty clips please? All those, as well as all the #PS5 and #XboxSeriesX tweets are making me feel bad! Some of us cant afford these things and it hurts my feelings!  https://t.co/R0RgOCNS1b<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RESPAWNProducts Morning! Not so sure if it's good yet... but morning it sure is!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RESPAWNProducts I didn't know we were even playing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RKneegrow @seizeyourmeans Well that's good, now I just gotta find the funds. My money tree is broken so might be a minute before I can afford the necessities to do so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seizeyourmeans Its not that I dont already have a decent assortment, and I have torn them down for cleaning, but to be able to create my own in some funky colors just sounds awesome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DadPrepper I wouldnt say destroyer, ha, but I'm working on it!  It's a long hard road out of (debt)hell, just gotta keep on /?keepin on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seizeyourmeans You all make me want to get a 3D printer so damn bad. I'm probably too dumb to make anything correctly but hell I'm jealous and respect the hell out of what y'all doin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KEEMSTAR I'm thoroughly intrigued by this! I wanna know what exactly I'm looking at!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DadPrepper  https://t.co/9ojXvLIROC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So got almost nothing but @Walmart dashes popping up today that I'm on strike from, and only dashed for 4 hours, still averaging $20 an hour though with what I didnt decline. Still not my goal but not horrible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigBryTV Story mode, on Multiplayer, off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KEEMSTAR I respect this answer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BDG_JB At this rate I'll be able to afford when we get that 2nd stimulus check...if that ever happens<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RKneegrow Oooooo.... pretty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr Agreed 100%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr Its crap! If I choose to not take it and  put "I dont want to go to this store" as my reason, it should stop showing me that store for atleast a little while.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I make this tweet and since have had nothing but Walmart dashes pop up. Like seriously stop please. I refuse to ge6 screwed anymore!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoorDash please stop trying to give me @Walmart dashes. I was all for it till I got screwed out of the last SIX tips. Yes, SIX times.... no tip. So what's the motivation there?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowackdesign Working. I dont know that other word...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Segamastertim I want to try this!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NoahJ456 Twisted metal has special place in my heart. Being a kid pulling all nighters at a friends house. Not a care in the world!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sonic_peed Haha well over thinking it I was<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewBCole @DriversAmerican Wont hold my breath on that goal but appreciate the positive vibes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sonic_peed But what's the meaning behind the poses? I'm confused!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewBCole @DriversAmerican Nice. I'm gonna start earlier tomorrow, try and go for 8 hours and shoot for atleast $150<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VraagSlim @DriversAmerican They are hiring...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pollux2789 Damn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alright so those of you who believed in me... I've made $120 for the day. Not too shabby. Essentially $20 an hour. Better then my day job and I get to play switch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HiddenCash Hard to say these days. As much as I want to say yes. I would probably end up helping if I was able. I'm a sucker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cathode_g @Ivan_Is_Back I dont get people that do that. Dont like it, dont acknowledge it. If you dont like a channel on TV you change it right? So what's not to understand here?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sasssymo My broke ass would greatly appreciate it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is it the worst direction hovers and the sketchy ass places always want the best service but think it's just fine to tip almost nothing????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewBCole @DriversAmerican Ya. Luckily my reg. Job I work 4-10s so gives me 3 days to do dashing or whatever, but then days i work are long. And ya bills and car maintenance are a killer lately<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Waiting for dashes to come in...  https://t.co/CHb1zK2wWJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love that $66 order with a 6% tip... fantastic... if you can afford to order food, you can have enough respect to tip the person doing it for you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KEEMSTAR @BananasRama<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh please have some luck in my life!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewBCole @DriversAmerican I feel ya. On days I work regular job I limit to only an hour or two of dashing. I work 10 hour shifts doin manual work so dont wanna wear myself out more then I have too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DriversAmerican I wish but I do work 40 hours a week and another job. I try and get in as much as possible but doesnt always work<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr Ya last night I did $80 in 3 hours. Sadly it all went to my girls phone bill... so hopefully tonight I can do $100-$150 for dog food and people food for the week<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Picking up @ChipotleTweets and then chick working is rolling up burritos into literally a ball... I'd be pissed if it was mine<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TurboDodson Wait, those aren't year round?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HiddenCash Anything people should be thankful for! I mean in a gamer too poor to afford the new stuff so that calls to me personally, but people should be thankful no matter what. Everything helps these days, physical items are cool, but lifted spirits are needed now days too<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pop_o_cIock 6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HiddenCash See the problem is all the people saying "pet" fuck that. They are family. Family doesnt get left behind for anything. Times are hard, and they still eat before I do.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AngryVeteran_ Let me know when it gets to be about a year if it decides to be nocturnal like my girl has been lately<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Times are hard. Monetarily speaking. But on a much bigger scale, the mental toll. The time I do have to enjoy and "relax" I find myself wasting it doing nothing.  Not the good kind of nothing either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I fucking hate the times we are in. I've never been rich, but I've always had the new games and consoles because it's what I truly love to do.  Now days its "can we afford to keep the heat on" or scrounge up enough for fucking food.  Fuck me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryVeteran_ That's one thing I've noticed about my girl, she seems to be nocturnal! Always whining at night but sleeps like a baby in the day unless I purposely try and keep her awake<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryVeteran_ Shes papered and not fixed yet. Was hoping to find a good male but I either dont like the dog, or dont like the owner<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@000_three My 2 favorites in one... what's under the hood!?!?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Riddle me this. Had a dash for Walmart last week. 100+ items. Paid $5.75. Then now I am doing one with 13 items. Paying $9.75. What the hell? Neither one has tipped yet either...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PNWUSCGPatriot @DriversAmerican The order was actually ready when I got there surprisingly. Although it was a chocolate shop so they didnt really have to prepare anything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UberFacts Then I'm fucking einstein and Bill Gates put together<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DriversAmerican Weather I am or not, the mall with lots of people is not my favorite place to be haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DriversAmerican I did. I'm just not a mall person. Thought it was a place outside not in the damn mall! Was not happy about it at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattGoesBuck Holy shit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hate getting dash orders inside the mall. If I would have known it was I wouldn't have taken it!! Making me walk a mile around people. 2 things I'm not fond of at all...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoorDash at first the Walmart pick ups were worth it, but I've now done 4 or 5 with no tips. $5 is not incentive to carry that many groceries up that many flights of stairs...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gpowerf Sadly not familiar with any if that. My knowledge is very slim when it comes to computers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gpowerf Is a Raspberry worth it? I need a computer for minimal things and want to learn programming<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HiddenCash Before covid, i wasnt the only one bringing in money. My girl was going to school and making good money as a bar tender. Now, she cant do either. 3 dogs, a rabbit, and 2 humans need alot of food ha. So I work fulltime and do gig work when not at reg job<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HogDexter Hahaha nothin but love<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>With that halo slipping down... I'd hate to use it to pull you to the ground...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr I'm actually seeing houses with signs saying "trick or treaters welcome" so...thats... something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gare_ted Ya. It's over rated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@koolaid See that's a hell of an idea, kids stay home and people bring them candy haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr Sad to say it is right<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gare_ted Doesnt it keep you frosty?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gold_Puree Wait what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gold_Puree Nothing your saying has any true relevancy to my statements. The only constant seems to be you getting off on yourself, which could be so much easier with a mirror then Twitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gold_Puree I guess standing on that soap box of righteousness just gives you a better view than I have.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gold_Puree I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for the super sweet pointers. I've never met someone so passionately over zealous about whatever it is your going on about. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gold_Puree So your saying that in return your gonna fuck with shit too? Makes sense... fuck that "be a better person" shit let's just retaliate! Sounds like a great idea!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Accepted $11.50+ @doordash before realizing was 2 drops. 1 was 8.50 and simple, 2nd drinks were put in bag which proceeded to leak through, made bag fall apart when picking it up. Was able to save everything and clean up packages with a smile for base pay only.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pfunk2300000 @DoorDash Acceptance rate is at 48% haha<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@krqe I didnt know it all was riding on his sole consent?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr So just to be clear, you did hand it to customer and they proceeded to take off the tip they originally had put?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr got a sweet pic for your collection today... #Ghost ,  #Goblin , #Dragon , and #spiders Oh My! #halloweendecor #lawnart #inflatable  https://t.co/Ksz5uP6iOg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My @DoorDash  completion rate took a hit to 99% today.  Accepted a Walmart one, then realized the order had more items then I could fit in my car!  Honestly hurt my pride a little having to unassign a dash.  Popped that unassign cherry though I guess...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StreamrWear I will be looking into these one day when bills dont take all I got<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lisa602 @the_giglebowski @DlvryDryvr @FoodDlvryChamp @themasterdasher Walmart ones have 15 days to tip though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So got asked at a restaurant if I wanted to join their rewards program they just needed my phone #. I give it to them and they respond "is the name Tex you?" What system would bring up my gamertag/twitter handle?? Wasnt mad, I was impressed! #PokiPoki #gamers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@the_giglebowski @DlvryDryvr @FoodDlvryChamp @themasterdasher I made 50 off one trip to walmart one time, so I can't completely hate it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@the_giglebowski @DlvryDryvr @FoodDlvryChamp @themasterdasher Usually have it ready, and most of the time you just park and they bring it out. But not always. I would say try it, feel it out once or twice before completely crossing them off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@the_giglebowski @DlvryDryvr @FoodDlvryChamp @themasterdasher Right before I stopped doin it they made it 24 hours<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@the_giglebowski @DlvryDryvr @FoodDlvryChamp @themasterdasher I've gotten some good tips off those like a week later, but also been screwed. So it's hard to say<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr @Uber @UberEats That was big issue when I did instacart. You would see these huge tips then all the sudden after drop off it's like $1.50<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr @Uber @UberEats I dont understand what you mean? Sorry I'm ignorant and curious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoodDlvryChamp These are kinda downers man. I mean I get the point. But not very uplifting<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Car_Porns @BananasRama Not a big Ford person, but I can give credit when its due<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheCondomFish Mood.... apathetic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DriversAmerican @LQ What grounds ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Could I please get a dash with a tip? Nothing coming up worth a shit so just taking what I can get. And it's ever so pathetic...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pulte $tex1E37  Since I keep getting screwed out of tips, might as well try my luck. Then again, based on this last week, I have absolutely no luck....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Take10Trivia @BananasRama<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The initial orderbtook me 15 minutes and paid double .. how does that make sense?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doordash so I know it was an add on, but for goin as far as I did does that really seem worth it? Plus customer with the $2.35 tip on like $50 worth of food then having to find a managers office in a Sam's club? Took me almost 40 minutes. Complete waste. Not cool.  https://t.co/LopDuzMEjQ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RebekkaMary 1. I dont need a huge house, but having a large piece of land surrounding is amazing. Then I could rescue more doggos!! Letting them run free on all that grass!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QueenieKris "Buttered- Toast"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DriversAmerican Not bad for pretty much only doing it during free time and days off. But then gotta subtract the $200 for new battery and tire I had to replace.  https://t.co/EPWtcKVMcN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jayde_don @TheRideshareGuy @Instacart And not many leave comments. But when they do they were always good. And still I made shit.  https://t.co/WAyh9qMYta<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jayde_don @TheRideshareGuy @Instacart Ya my record on instacart is perfect. I did it for a while, but always glitched out, and some how the "good" batches would never let me accept them. So I switched. Dashing depends on the day but i average 20-40 an hour and you dont have to do any shopping. Pick and drop off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jayde_don @TheRideshareGuy @Instacart Um ya. .. must be my ratings. Ha. Seriously try doordash for a week. You will stop pretending instacart is actually paying you well.  https://t.co/ByhTivM3Gj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TreasureLearn Valhalla or bust!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jayde_don @TheRideshareGuy Cool. You got a couple lucky ones. But it's not consistent. @instacart isn't worth it consistently and their shopper help chat has the worst communication ever. All around dashing is more money, quicker, and easier.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProConverters That rack sure has lasted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr @Uber @UberEats @DoorDash @NTB @MrTireAuto I never thought of getting a kit. But bet your ass I'm gonna go look into getting one here soon. Are they costly?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gare_ted Its healthy.  Dont worry.  Cause I'm a doctor.  Heres a prescription of suboxone. And a sucker.  https://t.co/XL9Dronhw9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr Ya I make sure to keep a spare all the time. The full size spares is a great idea though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DlvryDryvr Talk about replacements... I had to replace a battery and then blew out a tire doin a dash last night.... so much for making money...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheRideshareGuy I did instacart for months before doing doordash. Trust me you do not  make $20 an hour. Between bots and fighting to get the high ticket's you lucky to make that in 6 hours<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Izadeliveryguy @DoorDash See I want these kinds of customers. Not the "dont mess up my order or I'll leave a bad review even though I know you aren't the one who made my food" kinds I get all the time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Izadeliveryguy @themasterdasher Ya I can be really nice, but I also cant fix stupid and they really test your patience sometimes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Izadeliveryguy @themasterdasher Hey all input is good! That's essentially what I did, but he was just being a dick! Like dude, not wirth the $3 you tipped me to try and explain it over and over!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LtBuzzLitebeer @Battlefield @DANNYonPC Ya not even close!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoodDlvryChamp I've always dated bartenders so I usually tip pretty high. I mean it all depends on where I am at financially at the time. Like right now, I'm broke, so I tip only what I can, if I cant tip, I don't use someone's services and get it my damn self!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheCondomFish At a loss for words<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Like what's the point of doing something that fucked up? Theres nothing to gain except blatantly hurting someone else. That sits high on the douchey pedestal.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@themasterdasher I've noticed in my area stacked orders just do not happen. Maybe because the way of our layout, number dashers, or it my luck. But have not seen it once<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So first day of doing just @doordash didnt make as much as I wanted but $180 isn't bad I dont think?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So yesterday I did @Instacart 5 hours made $39. Then did @doordash for 1 and made $42. Doordash it is today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Instacart this distance, with minimal traffic, takes almost 40 minutes to do. I tried informing support but they didnt understand English enough to get what I was saying. Anyway, doesnt seem worth it logically when my tip gets changed to nothing all the time  https://t.co/YpDyZd6Z9s<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Personally feel that #instacart and other delivery gigs should tie into the weather apps and have little more incentive when it's raining and or other bad weather. #DeliveryDude #notFun #rain #FAIL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's hard to get motivated to start delivering on days like today. The batches are either ridiculously long distances or the amount that I would make is really not worth it. And I've done some worst batches just to make something in the past. #DeliveryDude #instacart ,<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GiveawaySquadd Come on luck....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@babymorgal Nope. It's me and my girl are both getting screwed for some reason. Did taxes through the IRS site even. Like literally no reason I or her should not have got it and yet here we are. Loving being broke that's for sure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@babymorgal No I do. Like I said I did everything exactly as they wanted and still nothing and no updates through the IRS site except...  https://t.co/0IKXGRbPGj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@babymorgal Damn m<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@babymorgal I did. I did everything a good little boy should. Absolutely no reason I shouldn't have got it already. Never changed account #, filed, live in same place, everything. But nope. They just love making me suffer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@raptor_primeval @officialmcafee Wouldn't that be a shooting not sighting?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OfficialTravlad Ok now I will try and hold my breath....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Shaostoul Cause sadly, I am not good at computer programs and stuff but I can smooze people and things like that haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shaostoul With that if you wanted. Just let me know what your trying to achieve (more detailed) and what exactly you want to achieve and I could start reaching out places like that in my spare time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shaostoul I doubt the schools in other countries are going to reach out, sad to say. But do you have someone that can do reaching out for you? Like marketing/PR person? I dont have all the spare time in the world cause I gotta pay bills and in poor, but I could help<|endoftext|>
