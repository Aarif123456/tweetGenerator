<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump LOSER IS AS LOSER DOES.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Several great ideas here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's everyone's wait time for #raspberrypi400 ? I ordered the kit through @Newark_Avnet on 11/2 and delivery is estimated around 1/4/21<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>💯😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bradfitz So the side effect is false positive to HIV tests?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr DO YOUR JOB INSTEAD OF BEING AN OBSTRUCTIONIST LEECH ON TAXPAYERS' PAYROLL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hacksterio Requires a bellyflop maneuver.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Without physical security, screen locking is only useful if you have a cat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rhatr Certainly, it's a good encoding for low bandwidth media (naked eye, rough seas), or when language may be an issue. But none of those restrictions apply to mobile devices that are several factors more powerful than Cray 1, and running Google Translate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Icons are to Operating Systems as "pieces of flair" are to "Chotchkie's" servers; and nearly as relevant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>UI should have a rule to not second guess what the user is trying to input.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Heartbreaking.  Requiring masks and curtailing in-person gatherings seems like a small inconvenience in comparison.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wonderful and inspiring.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coreboot They justified their decision with the assertion that the Earth is flat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>⚽️⚽️⚽️ in 20'. Fantastic comeback from 0-2.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bradfitz Just read it to Pat. She is speculating there must be some Italian ancestry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>283,000 ÷ 2,403 = 117.77  COVID19 deaths are 117.77 times the number of Pearl Harbor deaths. Trump and the Republicans who have propped him up are responsible for this. None of them care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reminds of a skull-cup-pencil-holder thing that my wife received as a gift. It met an unfortunate end; accidentally, of course.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>An important bit of computer history.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>A large private corporation acting like a large private corporation shouldn't be surprising. Their only goal is "increasing shareholder value"; any other goal is pure PR.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>100%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@govkristinoem Please spare us the usual #GOP nonsense to distract from your own failures. You can't even manage your own state. Nearly 10% of your population has COVID-19 (80,912) and 948 dead. You ARE the government and clearly you're no help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@migueldeicaza It is probably safe to speculate that a lot of ganja had to have gone up in smoke for the marketing people to have come up with those names.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@subboor18 @RichardDawkins @SamHarrisOrg @danieldennett @ChrisHitchens It ain't a religion. In some parts of the world acknowledge it exposes the person and the family to danger.

<|startoftext|>@davidcrawshaw @Tailscale Congratulations!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump #MitchMcConnell #AGBarr are setting fire to the house they too are sitting in. Their billionaire and corporate benefactors need to understand that they have the most to lose if Trump's scorched earth policy succeeds.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KamalaHarris @JoeBiden Congratulations. We love you. Now the hard part starts. It'll take a ton of work to repair all the damage the Republicans have done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In case you want to relive the climactic moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congratulations to President-elect @JoeBiden and VP-elect @KamalaHarris.  My wife and I are celebrating our 34th anniversary today. Your win is the best present we've ever received. Thanks to all who made it possible, especially our new favorite state, #GEORGIA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DebraMessing @morgfair No we're not doing that again.  Count all the votes and most definitely look into the votes in Florida. Miami-Dade results looked very fishy. There's reporting that some 27% of mail-in ballots in South Florida were not delivered by USPS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would anyone trust the results in Florida until this is checked?  "one of the worst failures occurred in South Florida, where 27 percent of mail-in votes may have never been received."   https://t.co/BQiPIWdGur<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Swarthy_Bastard seems totally legit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanCrossNYC It looks like Republicans' strategy to win there is to play hide-the-ball with ballots sitting in USPS facilities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One thing is clear: some 30%+ of my fellow Americans are OK with a liar and racist representing them even though he has brought them nothing but death and economic ruin (I'm no talking about billionaires).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@radkat "Connotations" dimension seems rooted in cultural context. Rumi and Khayyam poems are full of double meanings that could be interpreted as devotional or as courtly love. Cultural context is needed to see both meanings at the same time.<|endoftext|>
