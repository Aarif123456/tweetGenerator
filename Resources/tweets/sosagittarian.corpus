<|startoftext|>@glennkirschner2 @YouTube That’s because #LindseyGrahamIsADisgrace and #MoscowMitchMcTraitor name would come up in some of those investigations. They’re not fighting this hard for #TraitorTrump .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump is such a tough guy, but afraid of prosecution and jail time. He's not fighting for the #Presidency he's fighting to stay out of jail and avoid another #bankruptcy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The #TraitorInChief aka #IndividualOne must be held accountable for his actions. If not #America will never be the same. @RepAdamSchiff said it many times during the #Impeachment "if not removed, he'll be worse". Look at him now, trying to start a #War . 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's as simple as this.... #FuckTrump, Mark #Fuckerberg , #MoscowMitchMcTraitor #LindseyGrahamIsADisgrace , #AGBARR, #FOXfakeAssNews, #MelaniaTrump and the rest of the selfish, complicit #Enablers 🖕🖕😷😷<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I agree!❤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Next up #GeorgiaSenateRunoff we have to keep pushing forward. @ossoff @ReverendWarnock is the only way #BidenHarris will get things done. Remember when the #GrimReaper #MoscowMitchMcTraitor admitted to  blocking anything @BarackObama tried to do?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan I just said the same thing! This is B.S.!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's time to make an example out of the entire #Trump administration. Starting with #TrumpPence2020 #AGBarr #SecretaryofEducation #SecretaryOfState #MitchMcConnell #LindsayGraham should all be investigated and prosecuted. This way those that follow would think twice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something tells me #Trump has something on @senatemajldr @LindseyGrahamSC @tedcruz and others. With all the crimes #TraitorTrump has committed and they're still backing him and fighting to keep him in office.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I prefer a #GeorgiaPeach over a #President that has been #Impeached  Or an #Orange traitor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is why the #DownBallot is important people. As much ground #Biden has covered in #Georgia we shouldn't be looking at any possible #georgiarunoffs . But if we do #VoteBlueToEndTheNightmare<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#DontWorryDarling you and #Flotus can start calling two men and a truck. Ctfu 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What about #COVID19 , #stimuluspackage , #Healthcare ? You're still #President until #January ! And still not focused on the #Americans . Which is why you're losing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#America has a habit of taking 1 step forward and 20 steps back! When you all opted for a #RealityTV host over reality. 4years later here's the results. #BountyGate #Division #unemployment over 200,000 #COVID19 deaths , #stimulusbill not passed and #CivilUnrest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's #November4th  and #TrumpHasCovid  and told his supporters we wouldn't hear about #COVID19 after the #Election. Well here we are more deaths and more #Americans  hospitalized . Lies lies lies and people still #voted for #incompetence . 🤦😷🤷🙄😪🙏🤔🏃👮<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#democracy is on the line during these uncertain times. The #PopularVote has been in favor of the #Democrats and somehow the #ElectoralCollege count is what decides! #BushGore  is repeating itself. #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I knew we wouldn't have a decision today. But I'm still #PrayingForAmerica and hope #JoeBidenKamalaHarris2020 is the final answer.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Things to think about when you go to the poll's. #TrumpHasCovid #BountyGate #TaxEvasion #SCOTUSGATE #VoterSuppression #impeachment #Division #RacistInChief #KidsInCages #Healthcare #LiesAfterLies and the list goes on. So #VoteBlueToEndTheNightmare<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on #America if you haven't voted for @JoeBiden yet, please do so on #November3rd . Please and thanks!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Zombie apocalypse #TrumpRallyOmaha<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Everyone loves @BarackObama and he's not worried about who likes him. He's worried about the #Americans Meanwhile @realDonaldTrump is worried about who likes him and how many favors he owes #Putin for winning the 2016 election. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #BarackObamaWeek<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's call this #BarackObamaWeek since his birthday in two days.  #Trump you were right when you said " #NobodyLikesMe . 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The reason why we should wear a mask is because @realDonaldTrump spits when he talks. Right after he said " you don't know my energy". Sure we do! No energy to save #Americans but energized every weekend to golf in #Florida<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Evidence of someone who really touched lives is when you have a woman from #SaintLouis in tears. #America lost a jewel and a great #American should be when we lost #JohnLewis . Leading by example, his actions spoke louder than his words. #GoodTrouble and #GoodExample ❤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A confident person doesn't cheat or try to push the #Election date back. #FuckTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No sir The 2016 #Election was the most rigged in history. Remember when you yelled out " #Russia if you're listening "??????  We do! 🤔 #VoteBlueNoMatterWho<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The only time #TraitorInChief  says it's real need it benefits him.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's nice to be able to understand the words that comes out of a #Presidents mouth. Oh my bad, some #Americans thought it was a good idea to elect a #realityshow host.  Better days are coming<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#jameslawson is speaking the truth. #WeThePeople of the #UnitedStatesOfAmerica is what #JohnLewis fought for. ❤❤❤❤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump should resign. Pass it on.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>He calls all of the #Dictators very #Strong buy yet #TrumpleThinSkin is so weak. He hides behind his #Tweets like the wiz on the wizard of oz. Making all that noise , but scary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A man in his 70's is crying 😢because no one likes him. We don't need a #Weakling in office another 4years. To be honest, I don't think he was liked in his younger years. #TrumpleThinSkin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #AfricanAmericans  #Hispanics #LGBTQ  #Farmers #Elderly people, #Poor #whitefolks  #Uninsured , #Unemployed and everyone with #morals and #Values would #VoteTrumpOut  on #November3rd we can #EndTheNightmare<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Teacher's couldn't even get the pay they deserved before #COVID19 . Now #TrumpleThinSkin  wants #SchoolReopening w/o a plan or resources. I support a strike.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AGBarr  is full of shit💩 just like his boss #TraitorTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #JIMJordan  was as passionate about his players as he is today.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>There's something about the name tag Honorable #WilliamBarr  that doesn't sit right with me. Maybe because he's not honest.🤷🤷🤷😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To see #BlackCaucus standing around #JohnLewis today inspired me more! #BlackLivesMatter We've come far but still have a long way to go! ❤❤❤❤❤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi  you are one of a kind.  A speech from #JohnLewis at his own #celebration was on point. Thank you!❤ #RememberingJohnLewis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We the People of the #UnitedStates of #America deserve a sane #President . One that will unify us vs. dividing us. One that cares about the #Troops that keep us safe. One that doesn't praise #Dictators . One that doesn't lie daily. One that listens to #Science and STFU!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When it comes to #JohnLewis  I appreciate all of the years you served and thank him for the #GoodTrouble  When it comes to #MoscowMitchMcConnell  I think term limits and smell trouble. There's a difference between the two.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trumplethinkskin perfect nickname for #PresideWussy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Real talk!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In 2016 #Trump asked #AfricanAmerican what do we have to lose? Well you can look back and around if you didn't know then, you should know now. In 2020 I'm asking all #Americans what have you lost since he's been in office? Healthcare, loved ones, jobs, 401k, etc is the answer!<|endoftext|>
