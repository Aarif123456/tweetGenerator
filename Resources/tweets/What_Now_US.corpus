<|startoftext|>@driddlecavetto1 @Conixel @temptingfate7 @DiscoTempoJazz @HeathenOnEarth_ If there is so much fraud, why were the lawsuits rejected by the numerous and many judges and justices?  They were not all Democrats.  45 and the minions have no provable facts.  You may never see what you're looking for.  I need to know what "evidence of fraud on many fronts."<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@driddlecavetto1 @Conixel @temptingfate7 @DiscoTempoJazz @HeathenOnEarth_ That's what they get the big bucks for. Remember 45 can do anything.  This is a set up for a valid reason. tRump is quaking in his boots in the WH.  He is scared and I don't blame him.  I would be, too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@temptingfate7 @driddlecavetto1 @Conixel @DiscoTempoJazz @HeathenOnEarth_ 45 even sent his own mail-in ballots to NC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@driddlecavetto1 @Conixel @temptingfate7 @DiscoTempoJazz @HeathenOnEarth_ The funny thing about the mail-in ballots is tRump and his minions had plenty of time to address it as a preventive to alleviate their issues with it. They chose to whine and complain setting the scene for their "issues" now.  They didn't. tRump caused his own loss via mail-ins.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@driddlecavetto1 @Conixel @temptingfate7 @DiscoTempoJazz @HeathenOnEarth_ Due to the fact 45 kept asking for recounts.  That is the primary reason for the delays.  Notice the word delays with an s.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@driddlecavetto1 @Conixel @temptingfate7 @DiscoTempoJazz @HeathenOnEarth_ Do you really not see the reason for all this invalid fuss and trying to recreate the wheel by 45?  You need to see through the BS for the truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@driddlecavetto1 @Conixel @temptingfate7 @DiscoTempoJazz @HeathenOnEarth_ You are listening to tRump and not doing the research.  Georgia did certify and Gov. Kemp was dragged through the mud by 45 for it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@driddlecavetto1 @Conixel @temptingfate7 @DiscoTempoJazz @HeathenOnEarth_ My sister has worked the polls for years and is now a manager.

<|startoftext|>@driddlecavetto1 @Conixel @temptingfate7 @DiscoTempoJazz @HeathenOnEarth_ That is not true. The second audit was done by hand.  I live in Georgia and am very aware.

<|startoftext|>@driddlecavetto1 @Conixel @temptingfate7 @DiscoTempoJazz @HeathenOnEarth_ Do you believe that the three validations the Georgia polling teams conducted are invalid?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@driddlecavetto1 @Conixel @temptingfate7 @DiscoTempoJazz @HeathenOnEarth_ I don’t understand the fact that if the machines were incorrect in their tabulations, why were the down level candidates not affected? It seems that if the software engineers we’re going to cheat with the presidential election, why didn’t they cheat on the rest?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Conixel @driddlecavetto1 @temptingfate7 @DiscoTempoJazz @HeathenOnEarth_ Along with who he owes the $441M to within the next two years.  Everyone knows (except tRumpites) that the $200M is more than enough for his shorter, more maniacal  list of lawyers.  Where is the rest going? To his delinquent hotel bills?

<|startoftext|>I agree!  I am a Dem, too, as are my parents and they love him.  I just want him to get the recognition he deserves.  He's awesome! Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@keller_ina @senorbundy @IamHuma67575528 Absolutely true! Trump and his minions lied about the Pandemic Playbook, the firing of the team established to watch for diseases worldwide, the stockpile and the Trump Cabinet's training on Pandemics from the Obama admin.  Trump just lied about it all and still does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@keller_ina @senorbundy @IamHuma67575528 Translation: Obama's National Security Council left the Trump administration with detailed explanations of the tactics and key political decisions with which to react to a pandemic, the US news website "Politico" revealed in March.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gov. #LarryHogan earned my respect with his actions since he has been in office.  My parents live in Maryland and I know Gov. Hogan has their best interest at heart, Democrat or Republican.  He definitely told the truth in this interview with Tapper.    https://t.co/Om0SoPR9D6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senorbundy @IamHuma67575528 When will Trump stop enraging over it making the entire nation vulnerable and threatening our national security.  He is blocking efforts to address the virus putting more and more at risk.  When will he stop acting like a spoiled toddler?  It's over!  This is what enrages America<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChristianWalk1r What do you not understand about the facts?  Trump lost!!  There is no way he can find 4M+ votes and more than 56 electoral votes to win.  He knows this.  https://t.co/ghjljkGXb5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChristianWalk1r @HerschelWalker Where can I find more detail on this info?  Thanks for your help.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>How do ppl have time to make this stuff up?   https://t.co/IrLn0YysCX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump needs +4M votes and 56+ electoral votes to win the presidency.  The American people have spoken and we do not want to live under his dictatorial, tyrannical state of life any more!  Facts are facts!!  Da*n!!  https://t.co/HsMf7bDrpc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When will he realize he needs 4M+ votes and 50+ more electoral votes to beat President-elect Biden?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump How stupid is @GOPLeader's question?  Are others elected by Electoral College?  Trump and everyone under him in the #GOPComplicitTraitors are not the smartest bunch, especially after the election.  Their brains do not compute well.  Fact is fact.  Trump cannot make up 4M votes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m joining in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/SHrkVxvRaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, it's time to do it the right way!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Aren't you tired of blaming others for your errors? You had more than 100 days to resolve issues with voting prior to the election.  You chose to whine and complain.  Now, things did not go your way!  Did you see how happy people were yesterday?  The world rejoiced your firing!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump This is a lie!!  There was a Republican and Democrat in each room.  Stop making up lies!  When they are found to be untrue, you will look more pitiful than you do now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Mr. Trump, I have never called you that before.  America understands the disappointment and hurt you must be feeling. The outcome of the election is valid and true.  Please, for the sake of your reputation 100 years from now and your family, concede and step away with dignity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Blanco_B7 @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump Do you wonder why none of the accusations against Biden stuck?  It is 100% because they were not true.    Before you call someone rigged, please be sure you can back the claim up with proof.    Not unsupported accusations from a liar and his minions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Karma?  Or God?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I could not agree more!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepVernonJones  Once again, please grow up.  Stop whining. Be a man. I pray your constituents remember these moments when you are up for re-election. Please don't waste your time jumping on the winning train now. You have been exposed in your beliefs and injustices. You suck!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HerschelWalker Your sppke down to Americans who only want a good, just and moral president instead of the inhumane, unjust, racist  you support. Should make you feel guilty. In God's omnipotence, is there is a reason for your choice?  Please listen for His voice and learn His lesson for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse @VP How long are you going to hold onto Trump's dream?  It's time you have a real talk with him. He needs a dose of reality and if you were really his friend and not his flunky puppet, you would stand up, be a man and tell him the truth.  The votes are not lying. The process works.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Congratulations and let the work begin!  You are the one who brought hope back to our world!  I believe you are the answer to prayers and I will do everything in my power to back you to success.  Thank you for who you are and we trust you!  We have been freed from tyranny &amp; hate!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Its_Sargasm @staceyabrams Excellent ideas!  She would be awesome!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump should have been honest with America. He screwed all of us up with the lies and falsehoods he told.  All the conspiracy theories and hateful comments made us the laughing stock of the world.  Now, we can come together and fight to get our world back.  Back to a new normal!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course, I joined!  Looking forward to working my hardest until January 5th to put both our guys in their Senate positions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@staceyabrams Congratulations and thank you is not enough.  You saw us lose our voice and took on the Herculean task to lead us to gain it back and look where we are today.

<|startoftext|>@realTuckFrumper This is a real President. This is not just numbers; they are votes, people, democracy, America, us!!!!

<|startoftext|>@SenatorLoeffler @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Does this mean nobody else will give to your cause of running for Senate so your husband has to fund you?  Does that not tell how we feel about you from individual to corporations?  Don't you get it yet??   https://t.co/ZBNKt68bDd<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SenatorLoeffler You chose this path and since February, you have not lived up to the position.  I think Barr is your mentor.  Well, bad job done by both.

<|startoftext|>@SenatorLoeffler Jelly, Rudy Giuliani gave falsified emails to The NY Post!!  This is why you need to go back to Georgia.  Your racist and bigoted hatred is again unfounded.

<|startoftext|>@TurkanForkmaz @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump The vast majority should never have been infected.  Your remark points out how little empathy you have.  One death from COVID is too many, one death from police brutality is too many.  Both need to be fully addressed by the feds, not dropped like they do not exist.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@James__Mckenna_ @planar_arts @Lpuzzle6 @RelentlessYapp @KellyannePolls You were so far off track that it was impossible to believe you were serious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@James__Mckenna_ @planar_arts @Lpuzzle6 @RelentlessYapp @KellyannePolls Where did you get this idea of absolute power?  You're quite a bit off track and making assumptions.  At no point did I imply Trump had absolute power or could obtain it.  That will never happen if he upholds our democracy.  What are you going on about?  Who said that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@James__Mckenna_ @planar_arts @Lpuzzle6 @RelentlessYapp @KellyannePolls Apples and oranges - US Constitution and the Canadian whatever it's called there.  Not president and governors.  The emergency powers are not absolute powers.  This is why I suggested you do your own research first.  Your assumptions are not on point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@James__Mckenna_ @planar_arts @Lpuzzle6 @RelentlessYapp @KellyannePolls Are you a bit hyped up, James?  Calm down, please.  Not good for your health to be so heated.  Your 1st sentence does not make sense to me.  Would you repost, please?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@James__Mckenna_ @planar_arts @Lpuzzle6 @RelentlessYapp @KellyannePolls Where do you live again?  Canada or the US?  You seem to have gained a lot of knowledge over the past couple of hours.  Did you get your information from The Constitution?  If not, you want to start there.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ElCapitanMarve1 @TrumpWarRoom LOL!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigImplantFans @Bobby_Adjei @TrumpWarRoom You proved nothing.  Everything Trump says is true.  No reason to check it.  He has told over 30,000 false statements so far.  Keep your head down if you want to.  Don't check for the truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bobby_Adjei @BigImplantFans @TrumpWarRoom You don't get it.  I understand what happened when and why.  How many died during H1N1?  12K not over 200K.  Who doesn't get it???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kirby_ate_u @TrumpWarRoom The virus and it's destructiveness was known by Trump.  So why did he sit on it for so long?  Who destroyed the Pandemic department and the Pandemic Playbook?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1953mdl @TrumpWarRoom How about reading up on the emergency powers given to the president during a national emergency.  Who can wield the DPA?  Who can call in FEMA?  Who should negotiate with other countries for supplies?  Who can order the Army Corps of Engineers to come in?  Not the governors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigImplantFans @TrumpWarRoom Trump's famous "hoax" speech was given on 2/28 after Nancy Pelosi's trip to SF.  He was downplaying it when he knew the seriousness of the virus.  He knew!!  I doubt Nancy Pelosi did.  https://t.co/1EMTrDi5UU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lebo_22 @TrumpWarRoom Where was Trump?  Remember the "hoax" speech.  This is when he gave it.  He downplayed the virus at that rally.  What a leader!!!  https://t.co/MajUhsj9lY<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DEPBKLYN @TrumpWarRoom @JoeBiden It is so wrong it's funny. The homicide victim was never counted as COVID.  His name was listed in the NY Times not part of any COVID count.  You believe anything.  I've proven your conspiracy theories as wrong.   https://t.co/6zonIDWXZA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whosyourdawgy @TrumpWarRoom Conspiracy theories!  Did you take the pledge?  Who is Putin's puppet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's amazing how many intelligent people bought into Trump's lies without challenging or researching for themselves.  It's sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whosyourdawgy @TrumpWarRoom Biden is not a socialist.  Trump is not telling the truth as usual.  You have bought up conspiracy theories that are not true.  Please start doing some research on your own.  Please stop believing what Trump says.  Look into everything for your own safety.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@whosyourdawgy @TrumpWarRoom You are forgetting the Great Recession.  Biden headed the team that lead the US out of that.  How about H1N1?  There were 12K American lives lost.  You need to perhaps review b history again.  There was a Pandemic team under Obama with a Playbook ready for it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@James__Mckenna_ @planar_arts @Lpuzzle6 @RelentlessYapp @KellyannePolls The president declaring a national emergency does.  Tell you what... you go do some research on the powers of the US president during a national emergency and then I can help you with your questions.  To me, you do not make sense comparing apples and oranges.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@James__Mckenna_ @planar_arts @Lpuzzle6 @RelentlessYapp @KellyannePolls Oh, now you get to the truth of your posts.  You support Trump!!!  LOL!!  Thought you were Canadian???  LOL!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@James__Mckenna_ @planar_arts @Lpuzzle6 @RelentlessYapp @KellyannePolls I have answered you more than once.  You just are not reading the responses.  What is up to the governors and not the president?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeborahWadswor7 @TrumpWarRoom If Trump started addressing the virus in January when he learned of it, we would have had a better start.  He should have used the DPA earlier to ensure there was enough PPE and medication  for our medical heroes.   https://t.co/ltT2o83uX5  https://t.co/knpo4Aa5eF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/eQxzXyHx7h<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@James__Mckenna_ @planar_arts @Lpuzzle6 @RelentlessYapp @KellyannePolls There are built-in checks and balances in our Constitution. Once again I state you should research it. I would grant such power in an emergency.  It is not permanent. As one person, I cannot tell the president what to do.  Do some research to understand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@James__Mckenna_ @planar_arts @Lpuzzle6 @RelentlessYapp @KellyannePolls I am so sorry Canada does not uphold the right to declare a national emergency with built-in authorities.  Our Constitution does.  It was used correctly by Trump and has nothing to do with what I as an individual think. It does not take anything away from me.  You do not get it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@James__Mckenna_ @planar_arts @Lpuzzle6 @RelentlessYapp @KellyannePolls He is the president and he did declare a national emergency.  Biased talking points?  It is one of our government's options and should have been used.  It has nothing to do with individual rights.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LetUsThinkMore @TrumpWarRoom I take responsibility for what I posted, not for what you assume.  You are attempting to skew my words and meaning.  It's his fault and you are being purposely slow to understand my meaning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@James__Mckenna_ @planar_arts @Lpuzzle6 @RelentlessYapp @KellyannePolls As mentioned in response to your prior post, you do not understand and should get more info prior to making a determination on a subject.  It has nothing to do with personal liberties.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@James__Mckenna_ @planar_arts @Lpuzzle6 @RelentlessYapp @KellyannePolls You should really research prior to making a determination with little to no information.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@James__Mckenna_ @planar_arts @Lpuzzle6 @RelentlessYapp @KellyannePolls The two are not comparable. It does not give a person control of an individual's life.  It focuses specific authority to the president instead of giving more power to 50 different governors who would be doing the same thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigImplantFans @TrumpWarRoom If Trump handled it in the beginning using federal powers, this would not have happened.  Trump did not understand the power a national emergency declaration had.  We are still chasing the virus instead of being proactive to kill it.  We need better leadership.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LetUsThinkMore @TrumpWarRoom Like I said trying to start a fight.  His negligence, incompetence and lack of knowledge about how the government works are the primary reasons for the huge number of infected and dead.  He can fix it by himself, right?  Isn't that what he said?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@James__Mckenna_ @planar_arts @Lpuzzle6 @RelentlessYapp @KellyannePolls The president has an option to declare a national emergency.  Once he does that, he/she has over 100 powers  to address the threat to the country per our Constitution.  This is very different from the president's ordinary powers.  The problem was Trump was not aware of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LetUsThinkMore @TrumpWarRoom No, you're just trying to pick a fight. You know what I meant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Its_Sargasm I don't believe there is a contact tracing effort going on.  This admin has not proactively done what it should to actively chase this virus to it's death.  Ppl just do not realize how defenseless we still are.  Trump is a liar!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is due to his narcissistic personality disorder. He is mentally challenged and unfortunately still holds the key to our nuclear weapons as well as the scientists who could take us out of this COVID loop were in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is 100% true!  If Coronavirus/COVID had remained a public health issue, we could have defeated it like the world leader we are!  Why are we still trying to catch up??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AfonsoTorres456 @TrumpWarRoom You can’t even try to come for me!!  You’re lame!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paul1981 @B2theRyan @TrumpWarRoom What does that 10 minutes in history prove?  It’s been 6+ months!!!  You just don’t get it.

<|startoftext|>@lilly9117 @TrumpWarRoom WTF are you posting about?  Trump watched them each die all alone?  They died alone!!  Are you mentioning what 45 said today?  He told each of them that!  I do not have to call you a name to get my point across.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paul1981 @B2theRyan @TrumpWarRoom I sent you the Op Ed written by Biden on 1/27.  You have nothing more?  One statement against all the detail I provided you?  Go to bed.

<|startoftext|>@paul1981 @B2theRyan @TrumpWarRoom Why do you keep sending Bill O’s video?  Do you not have any other facts?  So what? One statement from Biden does not give you backup to blame him for the virus?  Many, many other things happened. Did Trump ask for input from the 2 men who could help him?  No, he did not!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BlackPearl99 @TrumpWarRoom It is not an issue of hating Trump.  I do not hate anyone.  I feel sorry for Trump bc he will be judged on his response.

<|startoftext|>@B2theRyan @paul1981 @TrumpWarRoom  https://t.co/9tENUlFxAP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B2theRyan @paul1981 @TrumpWarRoom That was Trump's call.  The agreement prior to the ship's arrival was that no patients with COVID would be treated on the ship, only non-COVID patients.  There were mistakes made across the country by many different leaders who never dealt with this issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LetUsThinkMore @TrumpWarRoom I never stated anything like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B2theRyan @paul1981 @TrumpWarRoom Another Trump mistake putting the governors in a supply clerk's job.  Who can wield the power of the DPA?  Who called FEMA in to assist?  Who else can take the needs of all  50 states to fill that need?  Who has the funds available to purchase the order? Where did you get 10K?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B2theRyan @paul1981 @TrumpWarRoom Theory and inhumane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B2theRyan @paul1981 @TrumpWarRoom I'm trying to understand why this matters to COVID numbers?  Yes, people die every day from every day occurrences.  That does not deter from COVID-related deaths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrincessObieWan @TrumpWarRoom You are incorrect per the CDC.  I have heard the theory you are relating to.  It is theory, not truth.  The CDC works from death certificates.  Are you saying our hero doctors and medical teams don't know what they are doing?  They cannot tell the difference?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The science tells the truth.  Their timeline does not support their story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paul1981 @B2theRyan @TrumpWarRoom You are so busy trying to blame the entire issue on Biden.  It will not stick.  That is your opinion.  Not fact.  Biden wrote an Op Ed and had the Pandemic Playbook as did Trump. Biden paid attention. Trump sat on his butt for 70+ days.  Biden was not the president!!! Trump was!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrincessObieWan @TrumpWarRoom Whatever you choose to believe is your choice.  I will continue to believe the scientists and their facts.  Not theory.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@B2theRyan @paul1981 @TrumpWarRoom No, not the same.  This Playbook was created after that and used some of the knowledge learned from the H1N1 virus.  It was not from the same doctors.  Trump dismantled the department and fired them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NetStepp @TrumpWarRoom No<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@paul1981 @TrumpWarRoom No, Biden would have used the Pandemic Playbook, the team in place and would not have gifted China our supplies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HerefortheBS2 @TrumpWarRoom Perhaps you are thinking of a different topic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrandonTimoth16 @TrumpWarRoom No, they were killed by the virus, not fear.  I prefer scientific facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JMDesros @TrumpWarRoom That definitely helped save a few thousand.  The number is still being debated.  Italy  closed it's borders totally to China.  The US did not.   https://t.co/u7sorcNuuv  https://t.co/Ceqtpibeh1<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TrumpWarRoom @ChrisCuomo Trump is putting other peoples lives in jeopardy by wandering around while still contagious!!

<|startoftext|>I wish they would do the VP Debate remotely!    @KamalaHarris I do not trust anyone in Trump's admin based on their handling of Trump's illness and McEnany should have  been told to self-quarantine last week.

<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan Where are their contact tracers?  Nobody is being alerted or self-quarantining!!!  WTF do they think guidelines are for?  They do not get COVID like regular people.

<|startoftext|>@Richard31331936 What selfishness and arrogance!!  She should have quarantined last week per the guidelines from the Trump admin.  Selfish AF!!!

<|startoftext|>@TheRealDainjaRu @JoyousPanther @thehill You're  cherry-picking now.  Last time, here is the crime Mueller says could be charged.  You're fighting until the last drop of blood is let.  Save it for January 20, 2021 at noon.  https://t.co/FJ5wIOStbW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRealDainjaRu @JoyousPanther @thehill The document says exactly what it should.  You are using one sentence to throw the entirety out.  The Report is substantial.  It just depends on which side you take.  Now, goodbye.  I hope your next disagreement leaves you on firmer ground.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRealDainjaRu @JoyousPanther @thehill Then why are we wrong?  I agree.  We will see the final judgment of these actions and others when 45 leaves office.  It has not been forgotten and is in the works even now.  Your opinion is just on the other side of ours.  We do not deserve to be called out of our names for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRealDainjaRu @JoyousPanther @thehill The name calling is offensive and would be to anyone.   Mueller's meaning is crystal clear and  when 45 leaves office we will see what follows.  I watched the testimony every day and did read what I sent to you.  You make very fast, unfair  and negative opinions of others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRealDainjaRu @JoyousPanther @thehill I see  Greta Van Susteren's opinion, if that is what you are referencing.  Mueller's statement was clear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRealDainjaRu @JoyousPanther @thehill It began with your second post.  Look at the names and negative viewpoints you state about us.  It's not a nice exchange.  https://t.co/ztjTLc00Tm<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheRealDainjaRu @JoyousPanther @thehill This is prior to the screen shots I sent you.  Keep reading.

We've all, except you, been very civil here.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BAMOShaunesy @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump There seems to be a disconnect here.

<|startoftext|>@BAMOShaunesy @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump They may seem inconsequential to some but they are a direct assault to minorities.  Chinavirus started the violence against Asians.

<|startoftext|>@BAMOShaunesy @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Trump does not address the plight of minorities but will definitely defend white supremacists.

<|startoftext|>@18cingirl @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Racial discrimination and police brutality are national issues.

<|startoftext|>@BAMOShaunesy @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump The real issue is division and no unity.  It has to come from the head down.  There was not turmoil in all the cities you listed.

<|startoftext|>@BAMOShaunesy @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump The cities with the violence and rioting were not on his travel list.  I do not believe violence and rioting are the correct response for action.  However, Trump could begin the effort to listen and work with the peaceful groups instead of inciting more violence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BAMOShaunesy @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump These are the trips Trump has taken recently.  What city did he visit that had violence and looting except Kenosha?  Who did he meet in an attempt to learn, negotiate or influence?  The info came from the White House website. It was in response to your statement.  Very apparent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You misunderstand the symbolism &amp; pretend nobody explained it to you.  Did you ever address the player's concerns two years ago?

<|startoftext|>@ciara_nicole777 @renekai @MJ72804966 @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Nobody downplayed the virus more than Trump.  He lied and caused more death by waiting 70 to do anything about it.  He knows it!!  Listen to the Woodward tapes.  It is unbelievable. We have 160K dead people!!! More than any other country and we are a world leader? He knew in FEB!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ciara_nicole777 @renekai @MJ72804966 @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump What parts of the country are still closed?  If we have to learn to live with the virus, why is so much money being funneled for a vaccine?  Yes, H1N1 is now rolled into our flu but we cannot do that with this virus yet.  It takes time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ciara_nicole777 @renekai @MJ72804966 @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Where is your data coming from?  What source?    The travel ban, yes, the wonderful travel ban!  Slowed and helped somewhat but look at us #1 in infection and deaths.  What really happened?   I have more info on this.   https://t.co/lB9XNMqEfN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ciara_nicole777 @renekai @MJ72804966 @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump That's your opinion and you too are biased.  We all have one.  I think lying about a virus that caused 6M ill and 150K dead is much, much worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ciara_nicole777 @renekai @MJ72804966 @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump How many people got through to air?  This argument is not a good one.  It was not random or scientific. People do not need to continue referring to it.  It is not a good example.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ciara_nicole777 @renekai @MJ72804966 @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Has Mr. Blake admitted reaching for a weapon?  This is why I say it is a different topic and not in any way linked to the first.  Why not let the our justice system handle the police and Blake incident? We do not have all the facts. There was no reason to attempt taking his life.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ciara_nicole777 @MJ72804966 @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump To say people do not want to work is incorrect. It is a political claim, not a logical one. I think you are missing the main point. How long has it been since we were in a war? Why are we still so far from inclusion and resolving the lower class? This is not the reason either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ciara_nicole777 @MJ72804966 @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump I understand what you were pointing out.  Pointing fingers at the wrong resolvers does not help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ciara_nicole777 @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump No, the looting and rioting do not help and the finger pointing has to stop. It's very childish coming from the highest office in the land. We have to come together and kill the virus first or we may all be extinct in 10 years. 3/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ciara_nicole777 @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump It is a top down issue, part of the president's job. Yes, they should be role models but they are human with different agendas.  I wish this was not happening but it has come to a head and should be addressed with empathy, sympathy, compassion and walking in other's shoes. 2/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ciara_nicole777 @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump This could be over and did not even have to start.  If Trump addressed police brutality instead of addressing kneeling, we would be much further Crime is not that easy to resolve.  If Trump  does not understand the reasons for protesting, it will not end. 1/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ciara_nicole777 @MJ72804966 @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump What light are you shedding on the validity of Trump's claim to have done more for minorities than any other president? Or his visiting cities with violence and protesting?  2/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ciara_nicole777 @MJ72804966 @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Neither party is the same. The world constantly changes and there are quite a number of Republicans moving over.

<|startoftext|>@Damion70263326 @TechHelp @IgnorantSpot @AndersonContmpo @ayemissay @godmoringmm @PollWatch2020 @realDonaldTrump He states "SNAP is the biggest welfare program in the US," that doesn't mean it went away or is not needed.

<|startoftext|>@Damion70263326 @TechHelp @IgnorantSpot @AndersonContmpo @ayemissay @godmoringmm @PollWatch2020 @realDonaldTrump If it's true, then it's true.

<|startoftext|>@Damion70263326 @IgnorantSpot @TechHelp @AndersonContmpo @ayemissay @godmoringmm @PollWatch2020 @realDonaldTrump It may be that way in Mexican families who tend to live together for a while, save, get their own and gather with family on wkends.  It is not the same with families of other races who are encouraged to move on with their lives like more educ or a job that leads to independence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Damion70263326 @IgnorantSpot @TechHelp @AndersonContmpo @ayemissay @godmoringmm @PollWatch2020 @realDonaldTrump I understand your take but it does not appear to match with reality to me. Divorces, partner relationships &amp;children growing up are much more involved than stating ads effect the outcomes of families. Emotion, financial issues, jobs, living arrangements would have more influence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Damion70263326 @IgnorantSpot @TechHelp @AndersonContmpo @ayemissay @godmoringmm @PollWatch2020 @realDonaldTrump So you concede the patriarchal family is not the primary reason Mexican food is popular?

<|startoftext|>@Hu2018H @BlackVotersMtr Is this an approved method to vote?  The article does not state it is. There is no website detail for each state and at this point, Trump is trying to make it harder, not easier.  I do not think this will be approved by 11/3.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackVotersMtr Voters can request Absentee Ballots by sending an application to their Election Offices.  There are secured lockboxes in most cities and states.  The lockbox locations can be found on their state election office website.   https://t.co/u7NIXZ1GPp<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Damion70263326 @IgnorantSpot @AndersonContmpo @godmoringmm @PollWatch2020 @realDonaldTrump Trump has had every opportunity to resume control of the individual states, cities. He didn't and will not do it. There should have been a national plan from the start of the virus.  He just wanted someone to blame and apparently it is working today.

<|startoftext|>@BrianAnthonyBo1 @dave_dcar08 @MarySaw14 @TrumpWarRoom I assume you want this addressed, too? 45 never will.  Remember the action he issued written by Tim Scott?

<|startoftext|>@MajorBatGuano @Gypsy725 @jennifer_snow3 @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump I agree totally. He still is not focused on it or the ill and dying. There are still PPE shortages and doctors choosing which patient is vented and which to send home to die.

<|startoftext|>@Gypsy725 @jennifer_snow3 @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump He was busy turning around the recession and adding jobs.  Congress would not support President Obama or VP Biden in a lot they attempted to do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MajorBatGuano @Gypsy725 @jennifer_snow3 @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump My thoughts exactly.  Bannon makes #10 of his crew.  You are also measured by the company you keep.  Crisis reveals character and Trump's shows by what he does, says and does not do. He is like a chameleon changing his thoughts, ideals and focus every day. He will not stop COVID.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Gypsy725 @jennifer_snow3 @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump I missed this one. I do my own research. 45 creates issues with his speeches and tweets by pointing fingers instead of solving problems. He is a whiner, not a solver. I do not support a racist, bigot, criminal, pathological lying psychopath. I do not believe in him as is my right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gypsy725 @jennifer_snow3 @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump You should sit down and listen to someone outside OANN and FoxNoNews. He is not a leader nor does he understand the real issues. He should be working on a cheaper version of remdesivir.  An approved treatment.<|endoftext|>

If he sat down with the protesters in Portland and around the world, the only remaining ppl are the rioters.  Arrest them then.  Now, he supports a possible terrorist group.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gypsy725 @jennifer_snow3 @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump I truly do not care what you think. It makes no difference to me.  I have better things to do and 45 is so shifty and criminal I would probably never find out what the real deal is.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump When there are enough tests to know who asymptomatic ppl are, perhaps ppl would be more comfortable voting in person. However, we all know the real reason you object to voting by mail is losing the election.  https://t.co/gHMLjgAo0l<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BWoody1213 @SurferKit @Pegster99 Now that, really sounds Stone-ish.  I was thinking Trump would pull money from some of the sources he already “spirits” funds from. It will be interesting to see what happens with him after the election.  Keeping my curious eyes open.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BWoody1213 @SurferKit @Pegster99 Definitely, the tactics of the last two weeks reek of Stone and Trump will give him whatever he wants now.  If Trump wins (God forbid), I see a job in his admin for Stone.  Trump has no shame.  What do you think?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Pcarb21 @Balancement @TeamPelosi @TheDemCoalition Are you talking about Welfare? It's needed now since we are in a recession/depression based on who you ask.

<|startoftext|>@Pcarb21 @TeamPelosi @TheDemCoalition You are sharing your opinions with no facts. That shows your lack of good judgment.  No, the conspiracy theorists are the primary issue.

<|startoftext|>@KenNYBUnChained @TeamPelosi @TheDemCoalition Look at the number of those contracting the virus and those dying in the US as related to the rest of the world.  How much further do you have to look? How many schools closed after less than one week in session?  /3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KenNYBUnChained @TeamPelosi @TheDemCoalition Why do you think he pushes for kids to go back to school?  That is backfiring all over the country but children can become infected and brush it off.  Why?  He ignores the truth and advances his agenda.  Beat the virus first, economy recovers second. 42% of jobs will not return.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KenNYBUnChained @TeamPelosi @TheDemCoalition You are belittling what I posted which is controlling. Why do you think Trump will not report the truth of COVID?

<|startoftext|>@gtrich1 @mojoRis82970268 @Conixel @StephenAtHome Also, we have no way to know who is asymptomatic bc there are not enough tests.

<|startoftext|>@president4hunn1 @redcaffeinepill @TeamPelosi @TheDemCoalition Nothing? I used your words. Did you not mean what you posted? What did you mean to say? You implied if blue states (which states?) did not send patients to nursing homes there would have been no problem.  I am asking for support of your statement.  https://t.co/9CCCghESET<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eldhogeorge1997 @TeamPelosi @TheDemCoalition That mistake did not outweigh the overall performance of Cuomo. His daily briefings were more truth than Trump offered on any succession of days. He did it the right way, he helped other states, he told the ugly truth, he hid nothing.  Trump is still telling lies about COVID.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricTrump Actually, it was excellent.  Now you and your daddy have ideas you can steal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@president4hunn1 @redcaffeinepill @TeamPelosi @TheDemCoalition No, for yours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eldhogeorge1997 @TeamPelosi @TheDemCoalition True  but remember the Reopening Guidelines were presented and the next day, Trump sent the LIBERATE tweets to VA, WI and MI, all Dem governors.  It started his push to open the states.  Very bad mistake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@president4hunn1 @redcaffeinepill @TeamPelosi @TheDemCoalition You did not differentiate. So where is your supporting info?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@redcaffeinepill @TeamPelosi @TheDemCoalition Yes, they have so gauge by total outbreaks, not deaths only based on population.  Outbreaks are also based on population size.  Johns Hopkins shows that detail also.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eldhogeorge1997 @TeamPelosi @TheDemCoalition This was a national public health emergency. In which case, the lead is shifted to the fed who can do much more such as use the DPA, etc. Check The Constitution.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@president4hunn1 @redcaffeinepill @TeamPelosi @TheDemCoalition Is that your pic?  LOL!!!  Cuomo admitted his mistake.

<|startoftext|>@redcaffeinepill @TeamPelosi @TheDemCoalition Well, bless your heart, dear.  I don't agree. I look at the total number of cases bc there are two different strains with the first more deadly than the one now.  Who is keeping totals on underlying conditions and releasing that info?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eldhogeorge1997 @TeamPelosi @TheDemCoalition Ryan John, I can tell you are ready for an argument based on the questions you are asking. I do not want to play  around with this. Say what you want to say.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Emperor_YZ @PeterNavarro45 Great cherry picking.  Tell the entire story.  So the Dems run the FDA alone? 45 had 3 1/2 years to move the pharmaceutical companies back but another broken campaign promise.  It's easy to blame the Dems for everything.

<|startoftext|>@Emperor_YZ @PeterNavarro45  https://t.co/08QCvtEUev<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redcaffeinepill @TeamPelosi @TheDemCoalition I look at this as a national problem. Currently, most cases are in primarily Republican states, right?  I am not pointing a finger at the governors. This should have been better lead by the feds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eldhogeorge1997 @TeamPelosi @TheDemCoalition I believe the governor played it a bit hardnosed. I did not understand some of the restrictions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeamPelosi @TheDemCoalition No, Donald Trump is not the president for our time.  He cannot handle it.  He has no plan except to partially attempt to battle COVID!!  Before he kills us all, like Michelle Obama said, we must vote like our lives depend on it. They do!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gtrich1 @Conixel @StephenAtHome @mojoRis82970268 No, I have not been anywhere but to my doctor's lab.

<|startoftext|>@MWenneshiemer @mtgreenee The wings of a plane are not as dense and sturdy as the body of the plane.  They would not have made a hole in the building.

<|startoftext|>@mtgreenee Your remarks about MS-13 are false.  MS-13 has been around since the 1970's. President Obama did not bring them into the US.  They have been here for years.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I watched Get Me Roger Stone on Netflix. I have a theory. 45 needs him to be a pivotal part of his campaign as he was in 2016.   If you read Stone's Rules (below), Trump is writing straight from this playlist. So Stone is free and probably working behind the scenes by now. 1/<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SonyaGreenleaf1 You are so right! Trump is the master of deflection for starters. He tries to keep our heads on swivel.  Our current admin is full of unfair, unjust minions and so many are following the leader. Never thought I would see the world like this. I just pray.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Keefer1958 @Etsy156 @newtgingrich @JudicialWatch This is a new topic.  They have good processes in place but a process is not 100% guaranteed.  If you have suggestions, please forward them.  There are 22 states that require ID to vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Etsy156 @Keefer1958 @newtgingrich The other mail-in states do not have a different offering.  It's 100% mail-in for each of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You'll announce something in 2 weeks, right?  You always promise change, info, updates in 2 weeks. For the majority of times, the 2 weeks never comes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keefer1958 @Etsy156 @newtgingrich @JudicialWatch You insist on being mean.  I am an American. I live here, was born here, have a family here and love this country. That's all you know about me. Generalizations are, in most cases, invalid. People are individuals and should be treated as such.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keefer1958 @Etsy156 @newtgingrich I agree.  There should have been a task force or something to focus on these issues from a national standpoint.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Etsy156 @Keefer1958 @newtgingrich Stop lumping everyone into one category.  That is unfair.  If you think that's an issue, raise the issue to a resolver.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Etsy156 @Keefer1958 @newtgingrich I would support online voting also but it is too late to arrange that for November.  There should be choices; mail-in, in-person, advanced and absentee.  Pretty much like normal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keefer1958 @Etsy156 @newtgingrich @JudicialWatch Oh, I do not have anything to take to the elections board. I am not the one complaining.  You are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keefer1958 @Etsy156 @newtgingrich @JudicialWatch A political party is not the entirety of someone's makeup.  You are making an assumption and it is invalid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Etsy156 @Keefer1958 @newtgingrich You mean due to voter fraud.  Go complain to your elections office. That is why I suggested they work on it now as a nation.  It will happen &amp; 45 will claim it's invalid and we will be hammered with law suits until Jan. 20 at noon, then Pres. Nancy takes over &amp;  45 is dragged out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keefer1958 @Etsy156 @newtgingrich Okay, they are still people who can address your concerns.  I cannot fix it for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keefer1958 @Etsy156 @newtgingrich Same as the previous post.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keefer1958 @Etsy156 @newtgingrich Why are you telling me what should be corrected? You need to scream at your elections board. I hope you did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keefer1958 @Etsy156 @newtgingrich In this case, the election should have been disqualified and a redo done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Etsy156 @Keefer1958 @newtgingrich So happy they were caught and the system worked. No ballots only go out to active voters. There may be some for those who passed within the year. Most of what you state is not a huge majority.  If it is, there is a huge problem in your state and you should complain to them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keefer1958 @Etsy156 @newtgingrich Human error has a lot to do with erred information causing recounts that can potentially influence the election.  There is less chance of tampering than human error.  There will be errors.  There always are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Etsy156 @newtgingrich Like I said you cannot guarantee it is counted if you go to your polling location, can you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keefer1958 @Etsy156 @newtgingrich Okay, #2 wirh 7 convicted for 1800 (not verified) votes. Please don't send NY and NJ incidents.  That is 3 and 4.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Etsy156 @newtgingrich You should drop your vote in a secured drop box if you want to ensure receipt. Even if you vote at a polling place you are not 100% guaranteed.

<|startoftext|>@DrWinarick @Porter_Anderson @madrid_mike @ProjectLincoln You have me questioning national offerings. Most states or counties have a website to the closest secured ballot box.

<|startoftext|>@wnseven014 @Dist_5 @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump I disagree.  I agree it was an over talking nightmare at times but what Barr said was telling for me.

<|startoftext|>@wnseven014 @Dist_5 @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump He answered enough. He was allowed to speak enough. His actions or lack of prove a lot to the American public. Barr has bent the law, used politics over law, made unlawful calls and ignored the illegal actions of law enforcement. He worked to prove it today.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@michaelzzzs3 @Finleyis4ever @drdavidsamadi Doctors have worn masks for centuries. Why change something that works.

<|startoftext|>@sp1coli1983 @TeamTrump @kayleighmcenany Your response is unfair. The majority of Americans want to go back to work and find the "new" normal.

<|startoftext|>@drarpatil You are a racist talking about backward classes. None of God's children belong to a backward class. I pray He teaches you that. You have no right to talk down about people. The caste system in India is cruel and unfair. Please leave me alone, phony, poisoned, fake person who lied<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drarpatil Have you ever been on BLM's website? You listen to the conspiracy theorists, right? Please take your poison somewhere else because you have presented yourself as a phony, having a phony narrative toward a phony end.  I have no respect for those who lie on purpose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drarpatil That has been fed to you. BLM protesters are primarily white people. Here comes the truth!!!  You do not want to learn anything. Your mind is poisoned by Q or racists or ignorant people who listen to one news program that lies. You did not hide it well. You are clueless on truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drarpatil What a negative thing to say. You are in India. What do you know about the average protester?  What you said should not be said of anyone unless you know them personally.  How do you cast a statement like that over an entire group of thousands and thousands you do not know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drarpatil Opportunities do come to you through blessings, work you do and pay back.  Opportunities at work are offered for jobs well done but systemic racism will promote a white person over other races.  Nobody I know wants something for nothing.

<|startoftext|>@drarpatil BLM protesters do not belong to a particular group.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drarpatil BLM protesters are the groups supporting the end of racism, the equal treatment of all races, equal opportunities for all races, against police violence and murder, not members.  BLM is an organized group advocating non-violent means of protest to gain equal rights for Blacks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Etsy156 @JasonMillerinDC @realDonaldTrump He has agreed to debate. Keep up! He has sheltered-in-place according to Delaware state guidelines.

<|startoftext|>@drarpatil There is no indication that COVID can ride on air and come into your house.  It does not travel that way that far.  https://t.co/3GauFdMUw8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drarpatil Your country is going up, too.  https://t.co/rhtmrO5x7r<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drarpatil We do not have enough tests to test those with no symptoms.  I can send you proof of that.  If asymptomatic people are not identified and quarantined, how do we stop them from spreading the disease?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drarpatil You did not answer my question about how it gets into the home if nobody is infected. If not one person in your household has COVID, you will not wear a mask either.  In most cases, the COVID infected person does not share the same space with the non-infected person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drarpatil Why did COVID begin it's assault again after businesses were reopened?  Prior to that when businesses were locked down, there were not as many new cases of infection.  Why according to your theory?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drarpatil Do you have proof all the medical personnel receive additional compensation?  Some first responders do but not all.  https://t.co/G6cFuSNtNn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drarpatil Do you have scientific confirmation of these opinions?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drarpatil Sorry, the virus does not live forever if it is on surfaces. It does not live forever in the air. If no one in your home has the virus, how would it get into the air in your home? I do not believe everyone will get COVID now. Perhaps when it blends into the flu like H1N1.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@drarpatil To clarify, please see FACTCHECK info. The blame for COVID is primarily based on the lack of action for 70 days.  It allowed the virus to take firm hold on America.

<|startoftext|>@drarpatil First, ppl don't like being referred to as "you people." Next, I think hate is a bit strong. Trump's actions have caused many problems that negatively affect us. His leadership has been biased, racist, sexist, confused, incompetent, and complacent. The election is his priority.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GreenAcres_LA @Conixel @peggy_fruge @GeorgePapa19 Much of what you theorize actually is researchable.

<|startoftext|>@TeamTrump Please stop drinking the Kool-Aid. Trump lies about just about everything and nothing is ever his fault.

<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Why does he refuse to address the issues that are life and death?

<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd You will never have deaths reported in close proximity to exposure. Considering hospitalizations gives a very valid tracking method and one that needs to be considered. It also will clue toward what is many may be infected. 2/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd You mentioned something I wanted to revisit. You said hospitalizations don't mean anything. Death is the measurement to use.  1. Deaths follow illness.  The average time from contracting the virus to hospitalization to recovery/death appears to be around 3 week.  1/<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd I mentioned Trump because your response agrees with his post and thinking. So the traitors are Satanists and pedophiles? They cannot make movies or TV shows and keep social distance and wear masks. You think they should still film? I forgot. There is no virus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New topic please. After the tweets today, do you think Trump is trying to start a race war? Why are today's tweets not verifying he is a racist?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd Yes, Jussie did but Bubba did not.  Whatever you want to think is fine. I have explained the difference I see. Crime/no crime. You back Trump &amp; what he says is true.

<|startoftext|>@essenviews @PressSec It's not in the binder she reads from every day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd You do not know the story. I thought you didn't.  Phelps, NASCAR president, told Bubba in Bubba's trailer after Phelps saw it.  The NASCAR owner got in touch with the police, DOJ, FBI,  and others. Bubba didn't.  He did respond to interview requests.  You have the story wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thephil26 @SportsCenter @BubbaWallace Jealous much? You do not think he worked for it apparently. You must not be a NASCAR fan?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd The two incidents are very different.  Not even comparable.  What Jussie did was illegal and he bought it on himself.  Steve Phelps broke the news to Bubba and Phelps went forward with it.  How are they comparable?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd The Jussie Smollett incident was January, 2019.  Darn, so current affairs and top 10 news stories every day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd Did Bubba report it or ask the FBI to get involved? Bubba never even saw the noose. The FBI called it a noose. This was not even in the news anymore after the FBI verdict.  Bubba spoke on it that following day and it was dead, not even discussed until today.  June 21 to 26.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec I hope you spill coffee on that book and are 100% lost tomorrow. Reading is fundamental to your job.

He seems to be creating more racial tension with his tweets. The Bubba Wallace tweet is just being racist. Bubba owes no apology.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeishaBottoms Prayers going up for you and your family. You are doing a great job. Thank you and your fam for your sacrifices.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd Thanks for sharing. Trump now seems to be using race to separate us. I believe we're too smart for it. Happy to know you found a place that feels good. Unfortunately, I have experienced hate and agree that the media does pump it up. So disappointed with Trump's remarks today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SportsCenter @BubbaWallace I detest what you had to endure. Way to rise above the hatred, racism and divisiveness thrust upon you. To try to crush your character to win a vote is despicable. He will be judged by another. Tell your folks congrats for me. You are a King and this POTUS, has no home training!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd I already follow more than the demoncicle and CNN.  I would hope you realized that. We choose to believe different politics, different primary objectives and different methods. Off topic but do you think 45 is a racist?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd You get off topic and start down some really off road subjects. I learned not to cover multiples with you the hard way. The topics are not even related and most times are accusatory and assumptive, not logical.  It usually prompts me to ask if you are angry with someone else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @GenFlynn I think you mean multiple responses per post?  You probably do.  I was upset yesterday. I never gave you a list of sites or publications. Was not me. I only said I was not addressing your off topic rants. Totally different. Do you tweet w/ me when ur angry w/ someone else?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @GenFlynn Off topic. You had one source in one instance. Remember it correctly, please. The other person doubted your source. I just wanted to verify the claim.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrsRota1 Sorry for your loss. Great pic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @GenFlynn Conspiracy. right? Not buying it.  Thanks.  Not someone told someone who knows someone.  Give me facts always.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd Yes, I do.  You're demeaning sometimes, too.  Goodnight. I am not answering your off topic rants. Never will.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @GenFlynn Yes, they do.  I understand Maxwell's part. How much more time and money on the missing emails?  Did you know Ivanka was conducting govt business from her personal email? Kept that quiet, Tired of the Trumped up long dead things only 45 cares about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd What are you talking about? Has anyone told you that you point fingers too easily? You also assume a bit more than most people.  I will go back and find out what I did not answer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @GenFlynn Trump could not even tell anyone what Obamagate was.  Nobody talked to  or worked with Flynn in 4 years? Did he just remember the intel when he decided to change his plea? Trump fired him and initiated proceedings. All criminals play to win. It's not fake news.  You'll find out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd I remember the memo.  I am not stupid but I don't remember 50K being a confirmed number.  I keep asking you questions but you are not responding.  I am going to bed because you have nothing to discuss. Your conspiracy theories are dead so far. Pls answer my questions. Thank you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @GenFlynn Why is it taking 4+ years for them to gather intel? Trump may leave earlier. Have you read the articles stating he may step out if his ratings get much lower?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @GenFlynn Maxwell?  What was the Durham reference?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd You should know if you don't do your research first, I will find out and correct you.  I am going to bed.  You have nothing else for me tonight, do you?  Any answers to the questions I asked yet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd Where do you get 50K? Yes, most people agree the lack of acknowledgement, leadership, delays, incompetence are all Trump. All him! Nothing to wait for. Trump's case is being worked on now. There is no Obamagate, nothing on HRC, nothing!!!! I stay current on the news and politics<|endoftext|>

It is a dead issue. Please clarify Durham indictments part. Think words are missed or something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd All the charts I gave you before were from the CDC's web site.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd I understand it. That was not deaths of over 120,000 Americans.  Why has the rest of the world been able to overcome the virus and we haven't?  Why is Europe open to travelers except from the US? Why do we have to quarantine to go to NY?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @GenFlynn What are they waiting for?  The new decade?  Not true, so not true.  What is taking them so long?  Four years?  45 knew there was no Obamagate.  Do you hear anything from him about that now?  No, he is a liar. Deflection is his tool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @GenFlynn You didn't listen to Mueller? He said the crimes Trump committed could be tried after he leaves office. I found out last week that may not be true.  Waiting for a response on that. It's been almost 4 years. HRC and the President are out of office for that long. That is idiotic.1/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd I am 100% a great American and they are guilty. I take traitors, liars and criminals very seriously. They used our country for personal gain, not for Americans. That is what makes me angry.  Read Bolton's book yet? Getting Mary's? I also don't like racists.  No respect for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd Once again, Flynn is a liar and a crook. I do not care if he is a general. That does not make him have clean hands. Same with 45, the lying "president."  I have no respect for either of them. 1/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @GenFlynn Mueller said so. He will be jailed along with Barr, Giuliani. Ivanka, Jared and more.  Going to be very interesting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @GenFlynn No, not because I say but because it is truth. What is in my face? Science and not conspiracy theories? I like it that way. QAnon is not for me. Flynn has nothing. Nothing has been proven against HRC or the President. Nothing will but Trump will go to jail when he leaves office.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Well, you're not listening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd Do you not realize Trump is surrounded by Republicans?  They are telling the stories to us. What states have the highest % of cases.  Yep, it's the Republican states, the let's open the state and skip a couple of steps. LIBERATE the virus.  The Rep states are backing off opening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @GenFlynn I retweeted it. Flynn is a part of the #TrumpCrimeFamily.  I don't care about him either. He's a liar and criminal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd It is science, not theory, idea, ideology or made up. Fearmongering! LOL! Stop putting your stupid theory words on me.

<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd No, 45 gets no break. He golfs every weekend. That's enough while people die. 45 sat on the virus info for 70 days and still minimized it as he is doing today.

It's always proven true. I hope it makes you go away forever. You're biased, opinionated, fixated, brainwashed, inconsistent white man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh I did not dodge it. I responded. I would pay both. I love my neighbors as myself. How can you change the mind of a narcissist?  Even his own support says he doesn't listen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh Substantiated facts. Not speculation.  I need to research healthcare for immigrants to make a decision. I've not done that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh I will never support a racist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd LOL!  You quote those wackos!  ROFL!  Please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh No, are you?  The topics have been your statement and who killed more people Cuomo or Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh I'm not slow but thorough. There's a huge difference. We asked for another one to support the first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh My response was about corruption.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh You don't keep threads going. A thread is all posts connecting together. You don't do that. This post is connected to your post, not a singLe separate post which is what you do. That is a thread.  When did you answer it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh Just one question, please. Why do you continue to choose one of my posts to attack?  It seems every time you show up, you're angry about something else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh Researching a statement, for me, thorough research requires more than one article to be believed. For truth and my own backing, I need more than a single source. It just makes sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh Off topic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh Off topic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh You don't respond with the post you are commenting on. You just start a new one. Usually off topic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh You're admitting one source finally?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh Off topic again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh You stated a point and never substantiated it. That's why we are asking for the validation you refuse to provide. You're off topic again and refuse to validate your point which means there is no reference and it's not true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh Opinion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh Theory??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh There she goes again.  Can't keep one thread going. Just all over the place. You inability to give a second validating source means there is not one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh Why can’t you support your statement with more than one reference? It’s a valid request. Both @hwestonbull_hhh and I have. Is there not another one?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Nobody is more corrupt than you, Bill Barr and Moscow Mitch!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh This is how you keep a thread going.  Bye, Karen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh You are so funny to  me.  I spend most of the time laughing at your ideals, ideas and theories.  It is so unreasonable and unlikely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh How backward are you? You continue to follow me and harass me bc I do not believe your theories.  Why don't you find another Dem to argue with? You can't keep your train of thought on one point. You become confused and jump around which is why you cannot follow or keep a thread.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MLCypher @aoxamaxoa @WajahatAli @TheRickWilson @ProjectLincoln I agree with you.  I see the social media from Biden every day.  It's primarily encouraging and poke at 45 sometimes.   It's better than spewing hate and divisiveness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KLGLASS2 Brainwashed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast We have no leadership.  45 may as well continue golfing and campaigning.  He's not helping Americans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh He is creating more divisiveness.  His tweets are evidence of that. No, we will see who is elected president in November.  That is the telling sign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh I recognize that there is divisiveness that 45 continues to trump up. He thinks he can do the same things as 2016.  It is just not working this time. Yes, one credible source would be great, especially if it was the president.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh You did not answer if you wanted me to start sending you articles proving 45 sat on his fat butt for 70 days ignoring the threat and lying about we have 15 and they are under control.  We have no illnesses. There is no threat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣We have a new flu strain every year. I am sure you have info that it comes from China every year.  I would love to see that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh That is not what you said.  See below.  https://t.co/rXNLT56jvP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh Why are there generals and Republican higher ups jumping off the 45 train? Nobody said CA and NY ran the country.  It is different now than 2016.  Hugely different.  So many are discouraged by 45 and his responses to issues.  Do you see it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh Don't even go there. LOL!  https://t.co/U9AUII8kUr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh That still does not total anywhere near the total dead.  There is plenty of evidence 45 sat on it.  Should I begin sending you articles that prove it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh Has it been confirmed?  Nope.  I will wait for confirmation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh China did not cause 45's lack of leadership, mistakes, mismanagement and ineffectiveness.  Nor did Cuomo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh No, how does China stem from Cuomo? Why can't you keep one thread going?  I think you're confusing yourself now.  I'm not confused in the least.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh Most people feel that way.  Why do you think so  many are beginning to jump on the Biden train?  This is a primary reason.  Trump's mismanagement and ineffective handling of the pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh You said Cuomo let more people die than Trump.  I sent you a screen shot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh  https://t.co/mjHXxiGGFa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh Acknowledge that China was the origin probably?  Yes. never said it wasn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh Cuomo or China?  Which convo would you like to finish first?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh You started those side comments, not me.  Look back at the posts.  You just keep typing and sending multiple responses.  It makes it difficult.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh Yes, you did bring this up.  I did not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh This still does not say the number of dead outnumber the total number of US deaths.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh No, direct blame.  His decisions have caused us to be in the situations we are in.  He's the man in charge.  He gets the intelligence and makes the final decisions about most issues crossing his desk.  I blame him for those bad decisions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh I do not do that.  Are you getting emotional now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh The virus did not reach US borders from China.  It came here from Europe.  It originated in China probably.  It's here.  45 waited 70 days to start doing anything about it and it grabbed hold very, very well.  45 is now campaigning and doesn't acknowledge this problem any more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh You did not send me articles.  I did say you did not understand how the Constitution works.  No pity party but you can't use abusive comments directed toward me especially when I have done nothing to earn them.  It's disrespectful and I do not tolerate that from anyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh The states are primarily Democratic. There are too many cities to determine.  No, it does not destroy anything. 45's fault was at the beginning when his lack of action allowed the disease to take firm hold of the population.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh No names or negative statements made.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh I responded until you began posting negatively about my abilities to research, make decisions for myself and the names your called me. It became not a discussion but a string of mean statements.  I will let you know if you approach that again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh I gave you supporting info in earlier tweets.  You may have overlooked them.    How did the total Cuomo sent to nursing homes and are counted in the total infected and dead add up to more than the 122K?  That is the total dead in the US today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hwestonbull_hhh She is frustrating, isn't she?  I will not permit her disrespect. Thanks for pointing out her unfounded claims and wacky info.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh You need to support your claim with more than one article.  Can you do that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh You have one article stating a foreign address, however, both of us can find no other supporting facts for the claim.  This puts onus back on you to support your claim.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh Where is proof of this?  Also, I asked on where you obtained your info a couple of times.  You never answered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh 1988 - 2020 is 32 years.   https://t.co/kw8UGCXRgg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @hwestonbull_hhh Where did Mrs. Obama live outside the US and when was she there? There is no info I can find stating this. Screen shot is from The White House info.   https://t.co/r09GuIHFql  https://t.co/8lgR7NSqtJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd Oh, I don't have to block you.  I can ignore abusers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd You see?  Abuse, belittling and you do not know me.  You however, are mean.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd You are being mean and ugly.  You should apologize but since I know you won't agree you are being abusive, I choose to no longer carry on this discussion.  Abusers never admit their abuse.  I responded until you started attacking with your words.  I never did.  Goodbye.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd Reread your comment.  Tell me that is not mean.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd Okay, I have had it with you talking about me. I take it personally. You have gone too far. I have not ignored anything or refused a topic. Whatever you want to think about me is fine. You don't pay my bills or rent or groceries.  I do not choose to be the brunt of your meanness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd You are talking about my ability to research and determine what is true. I never did that to you or disrespected you.  This belittling I consider disrespectful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd Nothing but the pockets were shown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd Also, please do not categorize me as "left."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd Now, you decide to continue belittling me.  I have not done that or disrespected you.  That's not discussing.  That is not a conversation. I am not pointing fingers. I am telling the truth. You choose to believe another "truth."  Simple as that but I will no longer take this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd The DPA has nothing to do with dictatorship.  See you don't know.  WHERE DO YOU GET YOUR INFORMATION?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd I have read 5 articles on Mrs. Obama.  Nothing about her being out of the county and not having 14 years in the US.  What obvious?  I take accountability for my errors.  45 doesn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd She won the popular vote!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd Not addressed bc I said your negative opinion on my research will not be addressed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd Did you watch the briefing yesterday?  Apparently not.  Go listen to it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd Here you go with that stupid theories.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd That was 45's idea for the ships. He misunderstood they did not want COVID patients on board.  Cuomo had nothing to do with it.  Nor the one in LA.  One mistake for Cuomo!  Look at Florida today. They opened too soon because DeSantos opened too soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd The DPA sat signed on his desk for almost a month without using it.  Public pressure caused him to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd No, you do not.  Where is your info coming from?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd It is the truth.  Trump was not the first and only!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd Your argument supports my facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd What does that have to do with anything?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd You do not understand how the government works in these situations or how purchasing works.  I do.  Can't one huge order cancel 90 smaller ones?    Governors bid against each other and other countries.  You don't understand that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd  https://t.co/1sFx1x3QIs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd  https://t.co/Be6T2Ap6H6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd  https://t.co/1GVsaPWvQK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd Not true!!!  Do some research.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd He did not know how to use his power.  Who stood in his way to partially close borders? Did not matter if they did not agree.  Who stopped him from using the DPA? He and his minions did not know.  Think!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd Directly which is what the Feds are for.  Did not the process change and the supplies were collected by FEMA and distributed by 6 distributors (3rd party)?  Did not FEMA confiscate equipment from hospitals that had already been paid for?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd What is Fox News? I may be wrong but is that your primary news source? I have many resources because I dig. Your attacks on my credibility and research will not be discussed again because you should know I research..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd Candace Owens is being used. I give her no reliability.  She spews divisiveness, like her dad, 45. I do my homework, you should know that by now.  I just arrive at different conclusions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd Where is the voice for the Democrats now? If 45 left office, we would have Pence who lies almost as good as 45.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd He should have been doing his job in spite of impeachment.  If your theories are correct, he should not have been concerned about it. The real ppl in power would have saved him and America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd I have researched your theories and been approached by others who follow the same ideology.  I understand it but I cannot follow it based on my beliefs. There is no way you can blame Democrats for Trump's errors. That does not make sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd That is totally untrue. I believe we went through this before.  The Federal Government could more easily order huge quantities competing with other countries.  The governors had to compete with each other and others. No $$s.  The states cannot use the DPA only the president  can.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd Politico noted it as did I. I saw this coming. BLM did not start the protests. The murders did. Check their website if you want to know what they have been doing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd So he would prefer people die or become ill rather than take the authority back from the governors and stop tweeting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd We do not have any leadership now. If he could have fixed it, he should have in January. He could have resolved it at any point. Would have welcomed it.  He didn't.  He does not know how to.  Ex. Tulsa, Arizona.  Failure, pathological liar, no compassion, no empathy, no science.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd On your 400,000,000 count, I did not state that. I'm not the one to address it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd he Fed should have lead this from the start but Trump does not understand how the govt works or the Constitution or Washington or Foreign Affairs. The USA is currently a laughing stock. He pays no more attention to the dead and dying. 3/  https://t.co/aCT4U0kzUH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd Did not Trump tell the governors to supply their own equipment and the next day begin using his power (as any other president before him would have from Day 1) to begin the process of obtaining supplies? Did he not understand the power of the PDA and delay using it (twice)? 2/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd That was his plan. He takes no responsibility for anything. I was not the only one who saw this coming. Why did Trump issue the Guidebook to Reopen. The next day, he posted the 3 liberate posts and encourage opening the country with no regard to the guidelines. 1/<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dedkobrez @Marchiana9 @sequinpants @ddale8 @factcheckdotorg Also, the climate at that time had governors bidding against each other and other countries for medical needs turning them into supply clerks. This was caused by misuse of the DPA. It's just much more involved that the article addresses. 2/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dedkobrez @Marchiana9 @sequinpants @ddale8 @factcheckdotorg I read your article and understand the points.

<|startoftext|>@dedkobrez @Marchiana9 @sequinpants @ddale8 @factcheckdotorg Cuomo erred on the side of caution and he distributed what was not used or no longer needed to other states.

Is 45 so upset with his current situation and us that he would let us fall ill and die?  Does he honesty realize what he’s doing?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BroMark13 @AriBerman It definitely has been. This has been one of the hardest and most heart wrenching times of my life.  You are so right!  He's destroyed this nation and I don't want to leave this mess, this swamp to our children and their children.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@geokeyhole @washingtonpost @senatemajldr never mentioned Congress was on a scheduled break.  It was his option to pull them back.  Also, the latest was due to @senatemajldr not addressing the urgent needs created by unemployment, hunger and Coronavirus/COVID. He only wanted to address appointments.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>With this current generation &amp; the protests, I feel it may be possible. They encourage me and my friends and we will support them no matter what.

<|startoftext|>For the first time in my life, I believe there can be an end to  racism. My kids (Millennials) told me during a deep discussions, that their generation was not as racist as mine.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump A month of people able to shop again &amp; filled with protests, growing unrest, growing COVID #s, no PPE, policing issues, however no leadership, no recognition of Americans problems, lives, jobs loss, evictions, hunger, financies and any problems. Not addressing them,they remain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vinit506 @tobi_johnson_ I understand your problem &amp; agree. She doesn't stand up for what she posts about unless you agree.. Personally, I wish she would stop making negative, biased comments that are not sound. Everyone is not an expert but everyone should be willing to discuss their opinions, posts.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Its_Sargasm I didn't have to ask. I knew you were right with me. I'm on disability, too. I love cats. My son has two. Have had a few myself.

<|startoftext|>@Its_Sargasm I can understand why she deleted her personal social media account but her business, no.  It's a shame to see people act this way with all the protesting against discrimination.  I wish I could join them. Since I can't, I'll continue to fight this way and I hope it supports them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AusFlynnsArmy @Trish3560 @SharonErwin3 @MixMamba35 @tobi_johnson_ Ma'am, I am not nor was I arguing with you. I simply asked for information so I would appreciate it if you would stop posting stuff. It's not necessary. A simple post would have been fine. I watched the video and get your point. I am not attacking you and your beliefs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trish3560 @AusFlynnsArmy @SharonErwin3 @MixMamba35 @tobi_johnson_ That is what I didn't understand.

<|startoftext|>@ActionBraxton1 @KertoT @Isabelleskdmore @gunther2cool @aleczandah @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Yes, I agree.  She trolled me yesterday and the posts started.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bekah_topaz I am so glad you're free.  Take this tweet and send it to Keisha Lance Bottoms and Captain Shields.  This should not have happened to you and you need some explanation from them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KertoT @ActionBraxton1 @Isabelleskdmore @gunther2cool @aleczandah @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Understand, Brandon, why I said she drank the Kool-Ade?  She's done.  I think she's really young and just started voting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KertoT @ActionBraxton1 @Isabelleskdmore @gunther2cool @aleczandah @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Means nothing to me.

<|startoftext|>@KertoT @ActionBraxton1 @Isabelleskdmore @gunther2cool @aleczandah @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Which means either you're very young or are older and do not care about your government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KertoT @ActionBraxton1 @Isabelleskdmore @gunther2cool @aleczandah @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump You know what?  You will not tell me what you're talking about so I do not believe you.  Goodbye, Stuck!!  You are too in a mold to be helped or even to have a decent debate with.  You have nothing so I have nothing because you will not explain yourself.  You think it's a game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KertoT @ActionBraxton1 @Isabelleskdmore @gunther2cool @aleczandah @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump If you do not answer with some detail, you didn't find anything as far as I am concerned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KertoT @ActionBraxton1 @Isabelleskdmore @gunther2cool @aleczandah @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Which claim?  Which one are you stating is wrong?  The Atlantic is fake news? Only Fox News is truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KertoT @ActionBraxton1 @Isabelleskdmore @gunther2cool @aleczandah @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump You don't explain what you are referring to so I assume you found nothing.  How can I understand and defend what you do not tell me.  I asked you again and again so you did not find anything for all I know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KertoT @ActionBraxton1 @Isabelleskdmore @gunther2cool @aleczandah @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @maddow You are not clearly explaining yourself, just throwing things out left and right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KertoT @ActionBraxton1 @Isabelleskdmore @gunther2cool @aleczandah @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump if I send you an article, I did not write it.  So you have to be more specific  because I still do not know what you are referring to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KertoT @ActionBraxton1 @Isabelleskdmore @gunther2cool @aleczandah @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump I do not understand what you think you uncovered<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KertoT @ActionBraxton1 @Isabelleskdmore @gunther2cool @aleczandah @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump What do you think is true?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KertoT @ActionBraxton1 @Isabelleskdmore @gunther2cool @aleczandah @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump After I gave you three examples and you found excuses for all.  I am not wasting my time to send you anything else except an article here and there.  It's just not worth it to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KertoT @ActionBraxton1 @Isabelleskdmore @gunther2cool @aleczandah @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump How can you prove something to someone whose mind is so closed to challenge and enlightenment that you make excuses for everything. He lies and most realize it.  You are just stuck!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KertoT @ActionBraxton1 @Isabelleskdmore @gunther2cool @aleczandah @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump You called them opinions, not true, etc.  You don't believe anything against him or potentially against him.  For him to claim Scarbourgh is a murder was enough of a lie for me.  He tore that families heart out and didn't give a crap.  I am so glad Twitter is fact checking him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KertoT @ActionBraxton1 @Isabelleskdmore @gunther2cool @aleczandah @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump He is a racist, sexist, bigot, etc. He is a pathological liar.  He treats people like crap, probably not white men so much.  He is dishonest as a criminal.  He is not a good person or a good president.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ActionBraxton1 @KertoT @Isabelleskdmore @gunther2cool @aleczandah @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump This was so disrespectful and a huge lie. All the protesters, the peaceful protesters were moved from the area by tear gas and rubber bullets so 45 could have his photo op.  He is the most prejudiced, racist, sexist, xenophobe, pathological liar ever to walk Earth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ActionBraxton1 @KertoT @Isabelleskdmore @gunther2cool @aleczandah @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Thanks, Brandon, for jumping in. This one is stuck in Trump's swampy bog very deep. She can make an excuse for each lie, saying it's opinion or some other excuse for the pathological liar. I sent articles to her but doubt she read them. She really drank the Kool-Aid.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I am from DC.  It hurt me to watch peaceful, respectful Americans shot at, tear gassed and disrespected by law enforcement so 45 could have his picture taken.  Well, I just wish I was home to cheer these DMV folks on.  I'm cheering them on from here and am so proud but hurt.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rising_wellness @xxkaitlynn_ @ACTBrigitte @realDonaldTrump 45 enjoyed the set up thatmade him look good. He couldn't have screwed it up if he wanted to. Ask him what the deficit is, why unemployment was slowing prior to 2020, ask what happened to clean energy, ask if he believes climate change is real, why he's destroying the planet.<|endoftext|>

You're really tripping, wrong and making things up, twisting. You're not American. I can tell.  English not your 1st language<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KertoT @CNNPolitics I'm not splitting hairs. I  just found the correct term.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KertoT @CNNPolitics You mean mental health,. The enforcement of mental health is the term. WTF are you talking about. You use some words incorrectly. It's like you're trying to use descriptive words but you're using them incorrectly. I am in Maryland. I would survive anywhere except the poles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KertoT @CNNPolitics Are you implying I have a mental illness?  How do you enforce mental illness?  You're not American, are you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KertoT @CNNPolitics Retarded is an extremely negative word and has been deleted from most people's vocabulary. Stuck is not. It just describes you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KertoT @CNNPolitics That was a test. If you found that the rebuttal and confirmation that there was no letter should prove there was no letter. You are brainwashed and stuck with your  head in the sand. Like he said he can stand in the open and kill somebody and you would deny ihe did it!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KertoT @CNNPolitics Media is not a demagogue, Stuck. You’re making things up now. I sent you reading material to enlighten you. It’s not worth choosing a lie it two for you to deny and say it’s opinion. The lies are well documented. Go read them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KertoT I’ve moved past this issue. There is no sense continuing the topic with you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KertoT @CNNPolitics You just refuse to answer about Scarborough. I did ask you about your use of the word discriminate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KertoT @CNNPolitics You’re getting nasty and degrading and you won’t address the other one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KertoT @CNNPolitics @GavinNewsom He’s lying about there being issues with absentee balloting. You still will not answer my question about Scarborough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KertoT What about the other one?  This is no longer worth discussion with you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KertoT @CNNPolitics Whatever you want to think. I would never degrade you with a poultry comment. That was ugly and uncalled for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KertoT @CNNPolitics That is your opinion clouding the issue. Who is Newsom discriminating against?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KertoT @CNNPolitics The quote is Trump tweeting. The fact anyone was used implies people who are not voters will receive a ballot.  The 3rd bullet addresses the inaccuracy of his statement.  Hence a lie. Newsom is discriminating against who ?  Did you not see the other one?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KertoT @CNNPolitics @GavinNewsom Look at bullet 3. I chose two I know something about. Did you see the other?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KertoT @CNNPolitics It will have your name on it and would cause an error when both are input.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KertoT @CNNPolitics @GavinNewsom I think you mean disseminate. Everyone, anyone is not the issue. Not so much his tweeting erroneous information.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KertoT @CNNPolitics Okay, you need proof he tells lies? Please don’t ask me to describe what he is. You definitely would not like my answer but he is neither you mention. You bought this discussion around to politics when it wasn’t about that at all.  Why?  If you need proof of his lies, let me know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whew!!  https://t.co/iCh42VhtH9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KertoT @CNNPolitics What I am referring to is lies, not a disagreement in policy, fundamentals or beliefs. A lie is not telling the truth and 45 has many instances of not telling the truth. Even his biographer acknowledges he is a pathological liar.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KertoT @CNNPolitics You use the word "retarded" a lot. It's not only CNN reporting  this. Of course, he lies about something almost every time I read or watch him on TV. Nobody can deny that. Who claimed he’s a traitor?  I never did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KertoT @CNNPolitics People decide what to believe. It's not the media making a person's decisions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KertoT @CNNPolitics So you're saying don't open dialog with/ anyone when they state something wrong?  I am not playing gotcha. I am rendering information.

<|startoftext|>@WilliamMcC1997 You send me one article that does't say what you think. Find some proof. I've seen the video. She never says anything you said she did. You check it again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WilliamMcC1997 I never said she didn't. She did not on that trip. Prove sfid. I was lready proved she didn't.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WilliamMcC1997 She did not delete tweet. She did not call Trump a or the travel ban racist or xenophobic during the trip. It was not political. You're still talking before or after  I keep saying I am addressing the trip ONLY. I gave you so much detail. You didn't look at or read it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WilliamMcC1997 The day prior to Trump's trip, not Pelosis. I sent you that. You need to look into the timeframes and what was shut down.   He never closed the US completely and he did it he day after jitaly did. There are quite a few facts you have wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WilliamMcC1997 This is just so wrong "and in one of your posts you provided trump’s statements to that effect and thus your support for pelosi under that thread is also trump support"  I keep telling and telling and telling you the risk was reported as low. There was a change to travel 1/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WilliamMcC1997 Trump banned travel on incoming Nationals who may have been to China.   "The administration’s action will restrict all foreign nationals who have been to China in the past 14 days from entering the United States.". Article attached.    https://t.co/wHr9l49tg7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WilliamMcC1997 What is your issue?  I am only addressing her Chinatown trip. She did not call anyone racist or xenphobic during that trip. That's where you started. I am not going to address what may have happened later. The article you sent was wrong about Chinatown. I went no further<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WilliamMcC1997 You do not understand. How many ways do I have to say it?  Trump was lying. The issue is not how many cases there were. Pelosi went to Chinatown to alleviate the growing tension against the Chinese Americans. At that time, there were not a lot of cases, no pandemic. Do u get it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/EPUDsKSlqP<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>From Politifact, At the time of Pelosi’s remark, U.S. health officials said the risk of the coronavirus was low to the American public since they had no reports of community spread. Trump during this time also said the virus was under control in the United States. 4/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>his trip was after Pelosi's.  He was continuing to deny the threat. He complained that her trip was during the period when travel was discouraged.  His was during that same time.   Pelosi could only go on what the admin (Trump) shared with her. 3/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Asian Americans were all Covid-19 carriers. Speaker Pelosi was standing up for her constituents to help fight this myth.

<|startoftext|>@WilliamMcC1997  In all your posts, there seem to be 2 issues.  1)  Pelosi's deleted tweet, 2) the number of COVID patients at that time.

<|startoftext|>@Its_Sargasm The article is amazing. Just seeing how much other countries make their citizens the primary focus. Here nothing close.

<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @PressSec That is not oranges to oranges. I do not see much Trump has done but create division (racial, sexist, class). To treat people the way he does is wrong.

<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @PressSec I do not blame President Obama because he tried. He tried more than once.I do not know why he did not do an exec order. I was not on his staff.

<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @PressSec He left it to 45 to complete since Congress would not move on it. I do not know about an exec order. I was not on his staff. He tried to handle it.

<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @PressSec You are jumping all over the place. Can we keep 1 thread going? I don't think you're reading my response.

<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @PressSec How many ways do I have to say it?It's ridiculous that 45 threw the playbook out, got rid of the Pandemic Prep team, sat on the news for 70 days telling the country lies about it.

<|startoftext|>@CtznCncrnd @PressSec I answered this question previously.  There is also reference in one of the articles I sent you. President Obama gave 45 a list of things needed and in 3 1/2 years, why didn't 45 replenish it?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BaileyShowers @nypost My granddad treated all kids that way, not just family. That's why I said I understand. The video is awful. Did you know he is a stutterer?

<|startoftext|>@slartybartyslow @SenKamalaHarris They did obtain more money for it but they don't administer the program. That's Mnuchin and the new IG is supposed to verify its done correctly.

<|startoftext|>@daveconte1971 @SenKamalaHarris @sunflowerinsea I don't think it's that easy. Doctors or MEs have to identify the exact cause of death or it won't be correct. It has to be on the death certificate, their records and reported to the CDC.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@swodo @Tinfoil58530199 @Practical_Dude @TeamTrump @TrumpWarRoom @realDonaldTrump It's curious why people supporting 45 never bring discussion topics.

<|startoftext|>@rock1040 @Pegster99 @chefjoseandres @waltshaub I know how much kids and some adults love and need milk. CA is working with FEMA to get the milk that was being poured out and NY, I think. I hope more states can do it. There are also schools still serving one meal a day to children. They could use it, too.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jakkedup1 Perfect description of you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jakkedup1 It's curious why people supporting 45 never bring discussion topics. It seems the pattern is 1) Attack, 2) Responds to valid questions with no facts and, 3) Start cussing and calling names. Never facts or discussion or debate. I would respect that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jakkedup1 No, you are mistaken. Just like all Trump supporters, attack,attack, cuss, belittle, attack.  The following could have been written aboutyou specifically.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jakkedup1 I supply you with data and you choose not to believe. Look at the national polls. They are so much stronger. America isturning on 45 just like Fox News. Trump's approval rating is in the toilet.  Watch him during the briefings. He is losing it. Look at his tweets yesterday.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jakkedup1 In all three states, Biden owes his lead to women voters, leading Trump by 12 percentage points in Florida and by roughly 20 percentage points in Michigan and Pennsylvania.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jakkedup1 The rest of the quote.  He topped Trump 50 to 42 percent in Pennsylvania, 49 to 41 percent in Michigan, and 46 to 43 percent in Florida (which falls within the poll’s margin of error).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jakkedup1 But, but, but!  That's Trump country!  His favorite news source. Until last week at least. I usually do not quote them but thought he'd believe it from them.  There's more than just that source.    https://t.co/wUA7DifaF6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CrazyBirdLady55 @HamburdersFrump @kylegriffin1 @WalshFreedom The head of the Army Corps of Engineers reported on the additional hospitals they are building/built. Did you not see that? Trump's been bragging on them.  There's a lot of info on the internet and the replays of the daily briefings. I tried to help you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CrazyBirdLady55 @HamburdersFrump @kylegriffin1 @WalshFreedom The additional hospitals built? The WSJ article I sent to you?  Trump's press briefings? I've provided plenty of info to you. Your choice to believe or not. I assume you support Trump and Fox News (who Trump is now calling Fake News). They have both changed their stories about it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWh17129042 @em__vaughn @realDonaldTrump Yes, hopefully, the pollsters have reworked the issues. You're absolutely right, we'll see for sure in November.  I think he pulled the undecideds, the Rust Belt and they both were underestimated.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HamburdersFrump @CrazyBirdLady55 @kylegriffin1 @WalshFreedom That's correct, ma'am. I've been nothing but nice to you. I never cussed at you.

<|startoftext|>@brhodes @smartdissent President Obama won one. Greta Thunberg was up for one. He ignored her after her presentation at the UN General Assembly. She bested him on Twitter.

<|startoftext|>@CrazyBirdLady55 @HamburdersFrump @kylegriffin1 @WalshFreedom So COVID is not the flu as you claimed.   It's more contagious, harder to overcome, we don't know long term effects. Our hospitals are filled, flu doesn't do that. The extra precautions support it. We don't have to be afraid, just careful and aware. I'm not afraid.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CrazyBirdLady55 @HamburdersFrump @kylegriffin1 @WalshFreedom You are correct. The total US deaths are lower.  I sent you an article comparing COVID deaths to the flu. It's a huge difference. Why quarantine iif its the flu?  Masks, gloves are not used for the flu.<|endoftext|>

His right. The historical info has nothing to do with my opinion on this current topic. My opinion remains the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeCamptown @shugyo4dhm @RepVernonJones I respect Malcom X. Different time in history and does not apply to everyone today. There is racism and bigotry. It's alive and well in all parties unfortunately.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@psclbssn @realDonaldTrump Absolutely. He is so delusional, just sick. Does he think the virus hasn't hit the service people?  He's still trying to kill all of us and restart the economy. War always makes lots of the green stuff for the US and kills people. Somebody is going to call him out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesOrlando126 @Syndicalist_Mia @onlyripley @T_FisherKing @quinnanimallove @OttawaRic @BetoORourke You don't understand the list of Trump's actions or Beto's accomplishments?

The economy he admitted was first. 3/3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesOrlando126 @Syndicalist_Mia @onlyripley @T_FisherKing @quinnanimallove @OttawaRic @BetoORourke He made the staff and advisors create the reopening document He rescinded it the next day Said the protestors were six feet apart on day 1 Just off the top of my head<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesOrlando126 @Syndicalist_Mia @onlyripley @T_FisherKing @quinnanimallove @OttawaRic @BetoORourke 45 had no government background.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Good. My evening appointment to watch you make a fool of yourself!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Except the numbers do lie. Trump’s approval among Republicans isn’t 96 percent, any more than it was consistently 95 percent from October through March and no more than it was 94 percent from July through September.  https://t.co/1JIjD2aXBn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>President Trump consistently gets low grades on trust. In the average poll since the beginning of March, 43 percent of Americans say they at least somewhat trust him on the coronavirus, and 53 percent say they only trust him a little bit or not at all.   https://t.co/bH5mtIxBQD<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The 2nd international policy mistake. You're a fool!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowitsbribery It's curious why people supporting 45 never bring discussion topics. It seems the pattern is 1) Attack, 2) Responds to valid questions with no facts and, 3) Start cussing and calling names. Never facts or discussion or debate. I would respect that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowitsbribery People are tired of his lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowitsbribery My mental game is so much sharper. I don't believe just anything. That's what bothers me about tRumpers, they take his word and don't challenge it when he says something one day and something else the next. Do you watch the briefings?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowitsbribery I have to send you something I posted. The gift sentence was followed by 45 is digging his own hole. He's burying himself everyday. It's proof of how delusional he is.He tries to change history. He's not the 1st prez to donate his salary.  He's a racist, evil, morally corrupt man<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nowitsbribery @NotATweeter16 @ddale8 @Yamiche You don't know me but your initial post was hostile and judgmental. Discuss facts, debate topics or exchange facts in a respectful manner is my preferred. Even 45 confessed she was a very good reporter.  Her questions are not always relating to race.

<|startoftext|>@Kate4Djt @PressSec @realDonaldTrump You never mentioned providing facts in your previous posts. Check it. Opinions do not override facts. I never asked you to look for anything.

<|startoftext|>@MrReali39272354 @PressSec @realDonaldTrump Lol!  Okay, I don't have a negative opinion on the article. It's good. I do have an opinion on the mayor's conduct. It was bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MamaTriedHoney @Hard2finetj It's curious why people supporting 45 never bring discussion topics.

<|startoftext|>@JaxWaterfront @LizRNC @TrumpWarRoom Trump does not tell the truth.  I have a number of reasons not to support him. I don't seek anything but truth, honesty and respect.  Not confirmation bias whatever you mean by that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrReali39272354 @PressSec @realDonaldTrump Not you. The other guy did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MohsenA14631942 @PressSec @realDonaldTrump I was born in America. I sound fake media?  What does the rest have to do with your or my posts?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrReali39272354 @PressSec @realDonaldTrump Thanks for the article. It explains very well why NY is so inundated with cases. It supports my answer. Tourism was not mentioned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrReali39272354 @PressSec @realDonaldTrump The Mayor was wrong. Never said he was right. I said it was not logical to believe his efforts to increase tourism caused of half the the population to become infected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrReali39272354 @PressSec @realDonaldTrump You said half were due to the MayorI never said the Mayor was correct but you think that many people visited NY in 2, 3 weeks?  Doesn't make sense. SF didn't have the same outbreak as NY. Blaming Pelosi when she didn't bring that many tourists into SF is not logical either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaxWaterfront @LizRNC @TrumpWarRoom Deep?  I think you meant sheep. I research for truth. I do not believe Trump, his minions and Fox NoNews supposed facts blindly. I probably know more than you about this situation. I've been studying it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MartinStarshine @LizRNC @TrumpWarRoom Okay. Even Dr. Fauci says we need more testing and the tests require other products like reagents for processing and swabs. These items are also needed and are in short supply in some states per governors and other health officials who are closer to the need for their community.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaxWaterfront @LizRNC @TrumpWarRoom I'm sure the Trump camp thanks you for yours.  https://t.co/iZQAMAKfXi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrReali39272354 @PressSec @realDonaldTrump Can you prove tourism increased in March due to Mayor DiBlasio's urgiing? I think your logic is flawed. NY's population is more than 2, almost 3 times more than LA. Sounds like a more logical explanation. Less Healthcare and more high risk diseases in blacks and Latinos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizRNC @TrumpWarRoom There are not enough. I didn't know Adm means doctor or scientist. I believe the governor's. They have data they share.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MohsenA14631942 @PressSec @realDonaldTrump You really believe those points, that's on you. I encourage you to research. Let courts, feds judge and prove.

<|startoftext|>@JDiamond1 I applaud your efforts to get a true and reasonable answer from Trump! You were on point with your questioning and he couldn't handle it. I apologise for him.

<|startoftext|>@Rhinoooo2 @freddyatton @realDonaldTrump The deficit had grown 16% as of January. He promised to balance the budget. It's going in the wrong direction. You have no idea of what my accounts and portfolio total.  I've never gone bankrupt or had a negative effect on this country. 45 has.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KellyannePolls @TrumpWarRoom Is this an excuse? 45 keeps changing the rules because he's the king of chaos and confusion. His strategy is F'Ing NUTS!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Rhinoooo2 @freddyatton @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/nLRPhIObKo  Tho strides were made the last two weeks, he lied about it.   https://t.co/b0UXk9Y3Hd   https://t.co/D93npAuKW4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rhinoooo2 @freddyatton @realDonaldTrump 45's morals, honesty, respect for others are lacking. He doesn't understand gov't, further proven this past week. He does not ever accept responsiblity, irrationally blames others and lies a lot. He's divisive, lacks sympathy and empathy.  Not my idea of a good president.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rhinoooo2 @freddyatton @realDonaldTrump You have your opinion.I have mine. An opinion does not make people stupid. There are valid reasons for both points of view..The debt of this country has grown under 45's admin prior to this current situation. A businessman with 6 bankruptcies did not fulfill this campaign promise<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden @DrWinarick Thank you for honoring them. It was a dark time. I am sorry for all the losses and honor them. Praying fo the families and friends.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexBarrella You keep making things up. I have things to do and have no more time for back and forth with you. It's not worth any more of my time or yours. Just agree to disagree like adults. Nothing constructive is happening. You can devote as much time as you want to waste.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexBarrella It fits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexBarrella Use the word correctly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexBarrella It's in your posting. Not hard to read there. Do you know the definition of bigot?  Look it up.  Use it correctly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexBarrella Lol!  Written earlier, it applies now.  It's curious why people supporting 45 never bring discussion topics. The pattern is 1) Attack, 2) Responds to valid questions with no facts and, 3) Start cussing and calling names. Never facts or discussion or debate. I would respect that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexBarrella Lol!  Very good out of 5 posts. Stop trying to dig and find something to critique. You'll get embarrassed. I won't even look for your item. For the third time, good luck. Goodbye!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @BretBaier You're a liar and people are catching on. Look at your approval ratings. Dropping quickly. Get ready to move. REPORTERS, GOOD JOB!

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @BretBaier You &amp; @bretbauer are so  https://t.co/UfJBxE287G is  https://t.co/UYD33AMHMP should be serious.

<|startoftext|>@AlexBarrella Whatever you choose to think and believe is on you. I know you're not correct and I have nothing further to say to you. You're not open, you're accusatory, incorrectly quoting me, getting unpleasant and upset. I'm not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexBarrella I never said you could not succeed. Your perspective is biased and unfair. You've accused me of very negative behaviors. You're not open to suggestions and I see you want to be mayor, tried to help but you don't see it so go for it. Again, good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexBarrella Okay, I'm not a snob but have been very successful in business, personal and volunteer life. I've helped many people reach success so think what you will.  Inability to understand and appreciate suggestions is not good. I can tell you're young so go at it. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JRavinmoore @TrumpWarRoom Who do you define as a globalist?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexBarrella Not true but if you can't take a suggestion for personal and professional development, then that's small minded of you. Nobody's perfect.

<|startoftext|>@AlexBarrella @AliVelshi @KeishaBottoms No, I'm not closed minded.

<|startoftext|>@WolverineGene @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @rushlimbaugh @TuckerCarlson @larryelder @FoxNews @seanhannity Just learned the Chicago total deaths from COVID so far was higher than the total homicides in 2019 over 400.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wmcoale @DrWinarick For 45, the economy wins. It bothers me that he has made no heartfelt, empathetic or sympathetic comments to those I'll, dead or mourning. He just doesn't care. Deflection away from his errors is his goal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WolverineGene @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @rushlimbaugh @TuckerCarlson @larryelder @FoxNews @seanhannity Dr. Bond has presented that data at a few briefings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoMurdochracy @EIDGeek @V2019N @realDonaldTrump The point I learned was you can do it right or wrong. Just understand what you're doing. It is not being treated scientifically but politically. It made sense to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ACMeinde @BCFPresident @TrumpWarRoom @DNC @realDonaldTrump @parscale @BlackVoices4DJT @AlvedaCKing @w_terrence @MsGailWilson @HW_Floyd @DonaldJTrumpJr @YourBCN @StarParker Well, if you don't care to give points you think are invalid, I will just disregard your initial comments. Facts matter to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexBarrella @AliVelshi @KeishaBottoms Okay, everyone can have their opinion. I read your frustrations in your misspellings and incorrect wording.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews We need standardized testing from YOU, money to hire contact tracers, equipment for processing tests and reagents needed, a formal plan for how the medical community handles COVID and regular patients. The states need funding.  USE THE PDA, STUPID!  ITS YOUR JOB NOT STATES!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 @smartdissent Restart the economy at risk of ANYONE'S LIFE except his!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi Unfortunately, deflection is his primary purpose in what he does. 45 will not tell the truth. He takes advantage of everything he can lie about and he carries on taking people's attention away and then he does anything he wants, changing bills, taking money away from education.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Pegster99 @DrWinarick @soychicka @LincolnsBible This needs to stop.

<|startoftext|>@trolloquently @realDonaldTrump You must not have really read it because it states:  What's False However, Trump's travel restriction did not fully "close [the U.S.] border to China," and archives do not document Pelosi's Twitter account having posted and then deleted a video of her Chinatown event.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@trolloquently @realDonaldTrump Jared Kushner is who he followed in the end. Fauci said they only had two meetings with 45 during which time they made recommendations.

<|startoftext|>@trolloquently @realDonaldTrump Are you kidding???  What does this prove?  Nothing. Trump had the Intel, not Congress!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@davidaxelrod @AmbassadorRice @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Susan Rice told the truth in an interview last week. The handbook, the meeting, the walkthrough for pandemics.

<|startoftext|>@DMZsixtyfour @stevenmnuchin1 That's awesome to hear. I'll pass the info on to them. Good luck and God bless you, your workers and family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samelljoanne @stevenmnuchin1 I can definitely understand your frustrations. We need to be sure it's safe to go back. Most people don't have an extra $50 normally. I know I don't. I just hope this is over soon. I'm tired of illness and death.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samelljoanne @stevenmnuchin1 That is how it was to be. Their checks don't come for another couple of weeks. In all fairness, please don't direct your frustrations on them.  Disabled people had nothing to do with it. The IRS issued checks to tax preparers and some dead people. Mnuchin is the right direction.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@stevenmnuchin1 Trump says it's going so well but my friends can't get in, don't have buddies at banks and are drowning. GIVE THEM THE $250M. You'll just print more money to cover it!! Give them a Trillion!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevenmnuchin1 GIVE THEM THE $250M THEN!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fred_guttenberg @UNBREAK64166467 @NYGovCuomo I did it!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dfrost733 @ThinkGlobalHlth @IHME_UW @AliHMokdad @realDonaldTrump @VP This doctor agrees.    https://t.co/lizs7NpUZJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DBelardoMD @ifindkarma I am and have been. Unfortunately, 45 lies and says he doesn’t believe it. There are still months and months of medical treatment coming. The feds are even confiscating equipment on the way to hospitals to deliver. #PPE #PPEShortages #coronavirus #COVID19 #medicalsupplies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CapriSonOfaB @realDonaldTrump I meant it as posted. Others like it. Your opinion not to.  Thank you for the explanation. If you don’t want to be asked for an explanation, please don’t post it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CapriSonOfaB @realDonaldTrump So what does “imagine thinking this is cleaver” mean or what did you intend it to imply?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@washingtonpost No. Just truth and my opinion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dfrost733 @ThinkGlobalHlth @IHME_UW @AliHMokdad @realDonaldTrump @VP That was uncalled for.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PepperOceanna @cljmo If there is ever an area and year that we need to come together, it’s this year, this election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PepperOceanna @cljmo Voting for Bernie Sanders seems like a vote for Trump because it’s not counted toward the valid Democratic party nominee. Why split the party?  Happened in 2016 to some extent  Just saying.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ThinkGlobalHlth @IHME_UW @AliHMokdad @realDonaldTrump @vp What are you going to do?  Federal issue so use the PDA for the purpose meant. If you used it the day you signed it, we would be in a so much better position!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@washingtonpost Is this supposed to impress us?    It doesn’t.   What impressed me was President Obama’s endorsement video.   He was honest, forthright, humble, and honest.   Twice said because 45 doesn’t have empathy or sympathy.   If the words weren’t written on paper, he wouldn’t say it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OneHomesteader @0Jessie_Dakota0 @weazry @eugenegu @freddyatton @realDonaldTrump There's not enough room here to really explain his plans I agree with. He's a better person than 45. Will begin rebuilding a better nation after the mess we've been placed in.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LewisCorrigan01 @Akikur19 @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump @jonathanchait The Democratic leaders want $100 billion for hospitals and health systems to support rapid testing and personal protective equipment, $150 billion for state and local governments and a 15% increase in the maximum food stamp benefit for families.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LewisCorrigan01 @Akikur19 @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump @jonathanchait The question is the results of the 2.2T for me. Has anyone received the $1200+ yet? Are the SBA loan being processed. 45 fired the IG who provided oversight. HThe Dems want better oversight. 45 keeps firing IG's unlawfully. It's a mess.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Wolfsfriend42 @tomabernathy Repeated where?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wolfsfriend42 @tomabernathy I don't hate anyone. You just can't prove what you post.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wolfsfriend42 @tomabernathy Like I said before I work with facts as proven to you. I don't just hear and believe. Apparently, you do. You presented NOTHING to support you "opinions"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wolfsfriend42 @tomabernathy That's what's wrong with you people. You never have facts. Neither does 45. Let him lead you into the swamp. I will not be there. Lol!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wolfsfriend42 @tomabernathy That's for a doctor and patient to determine,  even with chemo. Not 45s to advertise and suggest. That is medically illogical and dangerous. Let them finish trials safely. Now, lupus and RA can no longer find medicine and it's proven to help them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wolfsfriend42 @tomabernathy What facts?  You presented none.  I can. There are those who take what someone says as valid. I find supporting or negating facts.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Wolfsfriend42 @tomabernathy You did not answer my questions so you have no facts, just opinions?  I will send you the AMA's warning to doctors against it. Please see website listing in 2/ for potential side effects of Hydroxychloroquine.  How do people know how much to take?  Who  should not try it? 1/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wolfsfriend42 @tomabernathy is your Hunter Biden comment a proven fact?  When did 45 become a medical doctor with the ability to legally prescribe medication?  The AMA didn't even buy into it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomabernathy What a fu**ing novel idea!  Bet you like “We’re all in this together” and “the buck stops here,” too. 45 is not a subscriber to any of that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@smartdissent @EPA @EPAAWheeler We already have 3+ years to recover because 45 is the president who does not believe the planet is being poisoned. He favors mining for fossil fuels that will kill us.  Well,he can go be poisoned alone since he doesn't believe in science, pollution or anything outside himself!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biggest liar in the world. Every time 45 is presented with something he is RECORDED saying, 45 lies and says it is not true!!  Give me a president who in a caring, compassionate, honest and trustworthy. 45 is none of these. Money, only money is all he cares about!! Piece of crap!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tezisold Going now. I hope I'm not monopolizing your time. I appreciate it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tezisold Yes, to have the foresight and understand what must be done must take genius and a huge amount of foresight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tezisold Smart men. To have determined this, I admire them even more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tezisold I love history, too. Of course, it came after I started havingmore free time.  I am a baby compared to you and your knowledge. I'm going to find the book by LeBor to start. And then Terry's articles and book.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tezisold When I read that I jumped, physically jumped!  I have to find that speech. You've opened a new world for me.  I thank you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lhyoshi0323 @USATODAY I feel the local government is doing a great job.  The state not so much. I don't buy Trump's actions based to what I hear, read or am told. I make my judgement s based on research looking for the truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tezisold I read through the articles shaking my head. Now, I understand why you were so adamant about the numbers and comparison. Do you think Trump knows his power in this?  Do you think the way he responds to this virus is directed from above him? I guess it all is.Extremely interesting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC Just reinstate Obamacare!!!  @realDonaldTrump Makes everything harder because his grudge-holding, whining, narcisstic self has to undo everything President Obama did.  Our lives don't mean anything to him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smartdissent If he thinks he is going to deny children a good education to help pay for the $2.2T, he's crazier than I thought. He's doing some real underhanded crap when he thinks we're not paying attention.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tezisold I believe you, unfortunately. somebody a few months ago asked if we thought there would be a race war. Well, look at where we are now. It's so much worse.

<|startoftext|>@richsignorelli @UNBREAK64166467 Not only the masks, also PPEs, gloves and the meds they are running out of to put patients in deep sleep while they are inubated. I cannot imagine what it would be like to waken attached to a ventilator.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@essenviews Didn't he tell Trump the virus was no big issue?  Great!  He's has no use except to BUY supplies from Putin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JudeaPride @USATODAY He used the PDA last week but only with GE for ventilators. I don't think he understood what it is and what it does. I'm just happy somebody explained it to him apparently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@USATODAY Trump sucks as a president. He doesn't do or know his job, his power as president or what we really need. Poor excuse for a leader.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast It's really unfortunate that we don't have a good leader at the helm and nobody among his top advisors won't tell him.  They can't all be stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamalaHarris @lesleyabravanel You were EXCELLENT on the Steve Harvey Show. I so want Joe Biden to pick you as a running mate. Thank you for your encouragement, ideals and ideas and leadership. It is appreciated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tezisold I understand your points. So you think this is due primarily to economic problems, recession. Do you think there more underlying factors?  Before this, there was supposedly low unemployment, great economy. Do you think that was wrong. I never really felt it was right.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tezisold @BenjySarlin @ircrc Humanity just doesn’t fit your model. That’s my point. Apparently, you haven’t lost anyone to this disease. It doesn’t seem to be real to you, is it?  Everything is not rigid fitting your mold.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SenatorLoeffler Including Biden who warned him and wrote an oped in January about it. Don't waste our time. If you can't handle it step down. I personally challenge you to step up, not wait for Trump and his minions to save you and us. THEY WON'T!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorLoeffler Your nice video is not what we need,. We need a very on top of it leader, the more the better. Work with South Korea. They are saving their country and the first patient was documented the same day as ours. They are not dying like us. Trump needs to learn to play well w others!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorLoeffler Help Trump understand the need to keep medical supplies coming FOR MONTHS, use the DPA to open more manufacturing plants to fill OUR, I repeat, OUR needs, more tests. You're supplying a nation for months. Those initial, short, small shipments even the ships are not covering it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just praying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please, please #StayHome!  Let's all live!  I really want to live.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Defeat_Trump2 Maybe it can undo the harm we've done with no national push since Trump doesn't believe we are killing the Earth. Or maybe now he will believe science and scientists since ignoring them got us where we are today!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@USATODAY Why did Trump say he didn't know there was a shortage on the governor's call?  There are not enough locations either since his buddies on stage did not open drive-in thru's as promised. Does he forget?  Somebody needs to be more responsible. More medical supplies!?? Killing us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Defeat_Trump2 This can compound our problems. Some of us may be at the end of our ropes; mentally and emotionally drained, short-tempered, edgy, sleep deprived and impatient. Take a walk, deep breaths or just scream.  You're not alone. Believe me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorLoeffler Kelly, I know you mean well but right now, I have no patience for another Trumper.  He and you, in such overwhelming support of him, don't bring comfort.

<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse @EsperDoD @realDonaldTrump @VP WTF is wrong with you? Deflection. If you don't continue restocking supplies to medical pros, there won't be anyone to defend!!!  You gave away the stockpile for us to fight. You screwed us again.  Use the DPA to involve more manufacturers!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer 45 does not understand how the govt or DPA work. Keep tweeting they need to supply tomorrow, 10 days from today, 30 days. His vision is short. There may be discrimination against blue states based on earlier tweets. Somebody needs to talk to him to shake him up. Incompetent!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump DEFLECTION 101! Go find a way to keep the supply of medical equipment going. Use the DPA for more than ventilators from GE. Bring other manufacturers IN TODAY!! You are not thinking. It's easy supply and demand, basic principles. WE NEED TO SUPPLY FOR MONTHS NOT DAYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden @Defeat_Trump2 They supplied a bit but do not appear to have a restocking program to continue supplying the needs. How short sighted can they be?  How uninformed?  Make full use of the DPA!!!!  Put these manufacture to work!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OutFrontCNN @SenSchumer The problem with 45 Is he still does not understand how government works. He doesn't understand how to use the DPA. Someone needs to take charge. They are playing catch up and the virus is winning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenKamalaHarris They are the unsung heroes. It's a shame we are so exposed and there seems to be no plan from the feds to continue to supply medical needs. Trump needs to use the DPA for more than just ventilators from GE. More of everything needs to be in production NOW.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheDailyEdge 👏🏼My point exactly. 45 should have been honest from the beginning. He disrespected our lives, livelihood and families.

<|startoftext|>@RedRaidr89 @JMaddened @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell Mulvaney said it during a presser, then tried to walk it back hours later. Rudy admitted it. Trump did it. He was impeached but not removed from office. End of story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedRaidr89 @JMaddened @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell Please refer to my buddy's post. He gave verification.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedRaidr89 @JMaddened @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell That is incorrect. I do not lie and I have not resorted to calling you names. You learned about impeachment facts. I learned you have an opinion that I do not subscribe to.  Nothing else.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RedRaidr89 @JMaddened @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell You have not verified for yourself. You really should.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedRaidr89 @JMaddened @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell and you won't verify it for yourself. That's why you call names instead of stating facts. I have not called you a name. I understand people have differences of opinion. The impeachment is a fact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedRaidr89 @JMaddened @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell You are proven incorrect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedRaidr89 @JMaddened @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell Trump became just the third U.S. president ever to be impeached – after Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998 – when the House formally charged him in mid-December with abusing his power and obstructing Congress.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedRaidr89 @JMaddened @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell The rule is if either votes for impeachment then it is a formal impeachment. Removal from office is both house and Senate agree. Look it up. He will always be impeached in history.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedRaidr89 @JMaddened @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell The impeachment of Donald Trump, the 45th president of the United States, occurred on December 18, 2019, when the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives approved articles of impeachment on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedRaidr89 @JMaddened @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell That's not true. The testimony was taken very seriously.  The majority was cohesive and supported by other testimony. It became a matter of party, not legality. Also, 45 does not fully understand how government works.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedRaidr89 @JMaddened @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell He should have listened to his advisors and formulated a game plan in Dec/Jan. It's that simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedRaidr89 @JMaddened @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell The Democrats did not lie. There was evidence of the quid pro quo but 45 did not call it that.  Guiliani admitted it via Twitter and testimony verified it. That's why 45 fired everyone who testified confirming it. Biden and son have not been accused of a quid pro quo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JMaddened @RedRaidr89 @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell He will definitely go down in history as impeached.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedRaidr89 @JMaddened @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell I am asking you to give me what you want facts on since you've called me a liar multiple times. You have not presented anything I lied about that I can prove I haven't.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RedRaidr89 @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell 45 just doesn't want to be blamed for anything so he lies to make himself look better. It's not the best method. That's why his temper is so short if someone confronts him with a previous quote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedRaidr89 @hellyindler @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell On what point am I lying?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedRaidr89 @JMaddened @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell My opinion is based on research and facts. I'm sure you think yours is too.  We just agree to disagree like adults.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@livelygames @Kenneth42609302 @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell That's where common sense comes in.  Fortunately, this has not been an issue. It's the other way around.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@livelygames @Kenneth42609302 @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell HE BLOCKED ME!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBitchIsBac16 @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell Standing ovation!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nasira2020 @jeffw355 @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell Okay. That was their opinion. Politicians are not God and they are not correct all the time. 45 closed the borders 4 days after Italy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedRaidr89 @JMaddened @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell Your opinion. Don't think it will happen. My opinion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeffw355 @JMaddened @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell I do not watch CNN. I know and understand the truth.  Your "truth" is different. Still no facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedRaidr89 @hellyindler @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell It's not fabrication. You have your opinion and I have mine. I am not lying about anything so why call me a name.  Give me what you want facts on. You're judging with no basis for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedRaidr89 @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell How many lies has he told about just this disease?  From it was contained, 15 people have it, it will just go away in the Spring, sunlight will kill it. Please all lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBitchIsBac16 @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell Thank you so much. Character really doesn't change. It's not like changing your clothes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kenneth42609302 @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell 45 owns this. He has trusted advisors and has not said his advisors were touting differences or conflicting info. Only Jared Kushner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Picarat @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell In the past, the supporting science and technology are no comparison to what can be done now. We learn from the past, not try to repeat it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kenneth42609302 @Deb37222451 @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell Not my implication. Why was 45 caught so off guard when he was advised?  People are dying while they play catch up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JMaddened @RedRaidr89 @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell He's not getting his just yet.  It's coming. Being worked on right now. He has a real surprise coming.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@livelygames @Kenneth42609302 @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell Facts?  No, 45 owns it. He’s supposed to be our leader and he has all the advisors. The governors are the unsung heroes of this catastrophe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Picarat @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell What do you mean?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedRaidr89 @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell I am not ashamed. For what?  I am not lying. Why do you not recognize 45’s lies?  If he acted more like Jesus, I would welcome him with open arms but he’s a very flawed, liar. Why do you not see or recognize his lies?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hellyindler @RedRaidr89 @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell Thank you so much. Great points. He has no empathy or sympathy. I bet he has not called one family that lost someone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@knowstomuchjr @Kenneth42609302 @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell “I have black guys counting my money. … I hate it," Trump told John R. O'Donnell, the former president of Trump Plaza Hotel &amp; Casino, according O'Donnell's account in his 1991 book "Trumped!" "The only guys I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes all day."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@knowstomuchjr @Kenneth42609302 @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell He knew it was coming. He sold our stockpile. They know the person who brought it in.  Why wasn’t that airport shutdown and the contagion stopped there?  People are dying and many act like the don’t realize it. So many lives could have been saved.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jeffw355 @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell His racist traits have been proven.  Do you know about the Central Park Five?  Just one example.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kenneth42609302 @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell He should have acted in Dec/Jan at the insistence of his advisors and science. He wasted 6-8 weeks that were critical.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeffw355 @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell I do not subscribe to this type of information. Facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeffw355 @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell Isn’t this media stuff? You do not know if I personally believe any of this. Facts please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeffw355 @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell He will never say he’s sorry for anything because it’s always someone or something’s fault. Grown ups take responsibility for their errors. He whines and is a racist and bigot. Crisis reveal character. Did in his case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeffw355 @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell 45 accepts no responsibility for this. With the progress of scientists and laypeople over the past 2 weeks, we could have stopped this. Italy closed their borders 4 days before 45 did. I understand how he got where he is and it wasn’t how he wants people to think. He’s ill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeffw355 @HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell Jeff, I am able to form my own opinions, I do not watch CNN. If 45 had taken action in Dec/Jan we prob would not have so much illness and death. I am doing my part making masks and snacks for the hospital workers. Trump lies and I do not trust liars. He does it every day. 1/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My question exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DearAuntCrabby Yes!  I believe this 100%. Thank you for passing it on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HowardSelcer @RepublicanSwine @JasonSCampbell I keep thinking about the people who still believe Trump is doing an outstanding job must have not lost anyone yet. Do they have no empathy like 45?I pray the don’t but what allows them to continue having so much faith in Trump’s admin. It is so apparent to me and others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jerry12865 Keep it real, okay?  And factual, Jerry!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“I wonder how many people who are infected right now listened to that sort of talk (Limbaugh and Trump) and listened to people saying that it was a media hoax, that they’re whipping people into a frenzy and overplaying this to try to get President Trump impeached,” he  said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EsteeLauder @NYGovCuomo @elcompanies Thank you so much for your generosity!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FACT:  The US has conducted far fewer tests per capita than some other countries, such as South Korea and Italy, though it has been closing the gap in recent days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He admits the economy was #1. We knew that!  As daily U.S. deaths exceeded 500 for the first time, Trump pivoted sharply on his warnings about the economic impact of the outbreak. “The economy is No. 2 on my list,” he said Monday. “First, I want to save a lot of lives.”<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@donnabrazile Thank you for the information.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish Donald Trump had the empathy and humanity you show. He has told so many lies and so little support. He pushed his job on our governors. They are the real heroes. I do not understand your earlier praise of him. I wish you knew the entire truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrumpWarRoom @realDonaldTrump He had 6+ weeks. He should have had an action plan, inc stockpiling supplies &amp; not selling our inventory to China.

<|startoftext|>@TriBeCaDad @WalshFreedom @wapo He was warned of a possible pandemic and he did not address it. How long did he lie as to the seriousness of the situation?

That’s grandstanding and we don’t need it. Send trucks, cars, rather than wait. Save people!#25thAmendmentNow #TrumpFailure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BHPIII13 @EllenKurz @AdamParkhomenko Just like the grandstanding he will do tomorrow when the ship sails. Why did he not get a caravan of trucks to get the supplies there faster, at least 2 days earlier.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FOX5Atlanta Which is true?  Both?  https://t.co/voT798Hh8f<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yamiche About damned time!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FOX5Atlanta About damned time!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast Do you trust Rudy Giuliani’s medical advice?  I don’t think so. He lies almost as much as Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FOX5Atlanta And what does Donald say?  What does Donald?  Too little, too late !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yamiche He is embarrassingly stupid!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast Shows his level of stupidity. That's his friend but did Trump ask him to collaborate?  Our scientists are not working with scientists in other countries las they did for Ebola. Trump does not play well with others, only the corrupt ones!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HouseGOP @SenateGOP This is good for relief. How how about the stmulus?  Hope it does not require same the time and arguments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP Invoke THE PDA while you're there. Stop the bleeding!!  You can do it. Be a man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@azstudigital @realDonaldTrump @generalmotors @Ford Trump is playing catch up. No time to verify anything. It's offense instead of the defense he should have played in January.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarlosdelRio7 @KeishaBottoms Just like Trump does not understand science (disease control, climate change), how could he be expected to understand exponential math?  We have to continue saving ourselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nytopinion @paulkrugman Amazing!!! ON POINT.  The remarks are in line with what I've seen. Some understanding it all and placing blame on Trump (where it belongs). There's a second group that thinks Trump is rescuing us. The governor's rescued us by doing Trump' job. He needs to apologise &amp; invoke PDA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Acosta Is he not an a**??????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ifindkarma @MollyJongFast Trump put  15-day timeframe idea together. If he had begun focus via science &amp; medicine in January for 15-days, we would have had more time for research and preparation. It would have.made a huge difference, I believe. Trump has all of us playing catch up now at huge disadvantage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CityofAtlanta @KeishaBottoms @ATLPublicWorks Thank you for continued support!  This challenge we face must make your job even harder. It is appreciated.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#25thAmendmentNow #InvokeThe25thAmendmentNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mom2huskies @lesleyabravanel @realDonaldTrump Trump lies about so much. Now, ventilators are not being built. The medical teams are choosing which patient lives or does. The teams are unable to outfit themselves properly. This is so heartbreaking. #InvokeThe25thAmendmentNow  #25thAmendmentNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lesleyabravanel @realDonaldTrump And the DPA!!'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@speckholt2015 @UsaKapil @glamelegance @realDonaldTrump I can agree with that. There are evil people in the world. I have been closely watching this from the beginning. Trump did not take action though he was warned. This did not have to happen. So many people did not have to die.  https://t.co/r5eAlvSTrM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity Who really cares?  He sat on this issue for months. People are dying and it didn't have to be this way. @.  Unfortunately, Trump does not believe in science or medicine. seanhannity, you're on his payroll anyway!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NikkiT_12 @YpsiGal @GovWhitmer If Trump had taken action in Dec/Jan, we would NOT be playing catch up now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BuffaloTracer @GovWhitmer @ddale8 If he had a brain!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sharinotes @GovWhitmer They are doing Trump's job as well as their own. The fed can negotiate with big business. Trump can enact the DPA. The governor's were competing with each other. Have you kept up with what's happening to the nation not, only Michigan?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lakemichigander @GovWhitmer So does Georgia!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamromieb @GovWhitmer @AmyPandina Hope so!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NikkiRedeemed @GovWhitmer It's nottested and proven. Dr. Fauci has explained that.  Have you heard about the woman whose husband died because he took the meds. I trust Dr. Fauci to make medical determinations, not 45.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProfMJCleveland @GovWhitmer It's a real shame they are so narrow minded they can't understand the truth without being judgmental.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrumpWarRoom @GovWhitmer @ddale8 She is but Trump is not doing his.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tony_z1776 @WaveeBanks @ProfMJCleveland @GovWhitmer They currently have hospitals  overflowing as well as the emergency hospitals in parking lots, etc. Gov. Cuomo has said he will send any they don't need to the individual states. He's understands the state's needs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Leonard_Solano @WritesPat @ProfMJCleveland @GovWhitmer The governor's have had responsibilies pushed on them that Trump should have handled. He worked with big business to get ventilators, obtaining larger volumes than the governors could.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayevs @ProfMJCleveland @GovWhitmer Truth be told, the governors have and are doing Trump's job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProfMJCleveland @GovWhitmer Trump can, in his position, do more than the individual governors. He can negotiate with the big businesses and get more accomplished.  The governor's were competing against each other, it was determined. Trump can invoke the DPA. He hasn't but he can. The governors can't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UsaKapil @glamelegance @realDonaldTrump How do you know to trust this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glamelegance @realDonaldTrump He will never admit it, unfortunately. He needs to apologise to this country, too. #TrumpMeltdown<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BombshellDAILY Do we expect any more from 45?  He wants 4 more years and based on his handling, sorry, bumbling this disaster, are we really surprised at any dirty, filthy ploys he uses?   He has blood on his hands from his ineptitude and stubbornness but won’t admit it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC I’ve been so encouraged by the strength and kindness of our medical teams. They are a daily source of inspiration. But my neighbors and just people have shared that same care for each other. We don’t wear Democrat or Republican on our foreheads. We’re beings being human.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@funder I agree. 45 only goes general statements, no facts, no real numbers and the info he gives I don't trust. There are people dying while makes fanfare sending a damn ship. WTF!!!  How much more do we take?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FOX5Atlanta @realDonaldTrump You are grandstanding with this ship launch. Send the supplies with trucks TODAY!!!  STOP KILLING PEOPLE so you can show off!!!  More than 1,000 dead.

<|startoftext|>@FOX5Atlanta @realDonaldTrump Fix the US first!!!  Why are supplies being held until Saturday to go on a ship?  Get a damn caravan and get it there fast. They are sharing ventilators, making life and death decisions based on equipment. If you could save ONE life isn't it worth it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VAinRI2828 @elder_jodi He tried to kill us. That's what keeps playing in my mind. How much more do we need to take from the warped narcissist. I bet his children don't mean much to him so how can we. If he lies to us, he doesn't care for us!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blame it on the one who doesn't acknowledge blame!!  Donald John Trump. Never should a game show host be president again, please!

<|startoftext|>@BandsInTow @SpeakerPelosi How do you know fact checking was not done?  That is the statement you made. It was not true based on the first post. You question, not statement, should have asked for the source, not just say it was not done. That is an opinion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This opinion I do believe.  #covid19 #coronvirus #TrumpLiesAmericansDie #trumpplague  https://t.co/jtY6DJbraB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PoliticsReid @smartdissent Watching the daily press conf conferences  would be much better if Trump dropped out and let the team speak. They have the info, numbers and game plan. Trump gives no detail and he lies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bravo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshtpm @smartdissent @juliettekayyem @JeremyKonyndyk @cafedotcom @PreetBharara @AnneMilgram That’s why he needs to go. He put all of us in danger. He has blood on his hands and is totally responsible for this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshtpm @smartdissent @juliettekayyem @JeremyKonyndyk @cafedotcom @PreetBharara @AnneMilgram He doesn’t learn from history. He makes up his own. Dangerous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillHanage @V2019N That’s what I believe 45 is not considering this. It’s not just supply for now.  What happens on Day 10?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MichaelSholler2 @madmissmattie It’s another one of his dreamed up visions. He’s really after money but doesn’t care if he kills us all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYGovCuomo Thank you. You have been a bright light in all this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BandsInTow @SpeakerPelosi It was not an opinion. The fist post stated fact checking had been done. That’s what I meant. You overlooked that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Retread03 @LisaDNews - $250 billion for direct payments to individuals/families - $250 billion in unemployment insurance  - $500 billion for distressed companies - $367 billion for small businesses  - $130 billion for hospitals  - $150 billion for state and local governments<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PosterBoyHec @Lananalula @TimOBrien In addition, the hospitals need additional supplies like ventilators, masks and PPE more than normal. The virus is expensive.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It’s going to be helpful to us but I don’t think it’s enough. They will probably have to do another one. And further down into Trump’s swamp we go.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Trump said during a Fox News town hall that he wants the country "opened up and just raring to go by Easter," which is April 12. Doctors, scientists and even the President's own coronavirus task force disagree. #CoronavirusLockdown #TrumpLiesAmericansDie   https://t.co/tbDdmVjzjF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump No you are not and have not been. How dare you lie again. You sent the governors on a wold goose chase doing your job. You are lower than dirt. Do us a favor and resign. A toddler could do better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRickyDavila @RepublicanSwine Makes me wonder, too. Nobody has addressed whether or not our children’s children’s children will have to pay this back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs @FoxBusiness Why waste our time sending this?  Go do something worthwhile and helpful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepublicanSwine Sounds like Trump dreamed this up and is calling on his minions to spread it. Coronavirus is not taking enough of us out.  Trump and Glen Beck can go first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yamiche Still doing it!  You go!  You need an award, raise, party, something because every day, you do an incredible job!  Thank you so much!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Yamiche He’s playing God again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelCBender @Yamiche So disappointed in those that cannot see the truth. He caused t. The governors are saving us and Trump has created more chaos in his handling of it.  Please wake up, people.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NYGovCuomo I am not a New Yorker but I appreciate all you’ve done for your state. Your leadership has been first class and admirable. The way Trump has treated all the governors is reprehensible and plain ignorant. He doesn’t understand how government works, only game shows. Thank you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yamiche He is past crazy. His focus is money and more money. I think he’s becoming delusional. He does not understand government and how it works. Unfortunately, it’s to our disadvantage.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TeamTrump @Mike_Pence Puppet<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Rrijght in step with his president, he only wants to kill some.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrTedros @realDonaldTrump Dr. Tedros, he has been defensive, presented no factual information, told a huge variety of lies, told many lies, tried to embarrass reporters asking valid questions, sowed racism “Chinese Virus,” created discord with citizens and our representatives.

<|startoftext|>@patrickmkcirtap @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump I don’t see a president either  I see a reality show host who fooled some into believing he could run the US government like he did a business.

<|startoftext|>That’s probably why Fauci is not there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alaskawater I believe they are selfishly thinking about retaining the support of these businesses and their money. They have to think about their remaining time in office as well as what they will do after they leave. It’s all about the money, unfortunately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alaskawater @SuMoh7 And he is 100% narcissist. Unbelievable he’s in the position he’s in.  So sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Johnthemadmonk @MollyJongFast Charity in the flesh. God bless him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KLoeffler You told so many lies in your tweets about the stimulus that it makes it hard to believe anything you say or tweet. Bring on the experts and stop listening to that advisor. I’m am a constituent and extremely disappointed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KLoeffler How is this any different or any more believable than your original statement?  This will need to be investigated before it can be believed.

<|startoftext|>@SenatorLoeffler You are just a crazy, lying, guilty thief!  When you send out stupid stuff like this, it makes it harder for you to be believed. You are frustrating. You could not find your way to the truth if if there were blinking neon lights showing you the way. TELL THE TRUTH. #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorLoeffler You infuriate me! After 2 months in the job, you are proving you never should have been there in the first place.  WHO KEEPS TELLING YOU WHAT TO DO?

<|startoftext|>@Mike_Pence Trump is not. His narcissism will not allow it. That man makes me ashamed to be an American. He has caused racism we thought was the past. He fights for the rich.

<|startoftext|>@smartdissent Wasn’t that one of his campaign promises?  Never actually saw that new plan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OldWomanWeezer @MollyJongFast Unabashedly!  Makes it even worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast When he lifts his head and starts his usual rhetoric and generalities, he just makes me ill. He should stick to the script and get out or not show up at all. Even better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonaldKlain @smartdissent Okay, sent to FB. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Surgeon_General question, please. Why don’t the  folks in the  the testing centers verify people have symptoms before testing. Would that help weed out the unnecessary ones?  I realize there may be lies told but it could save kits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MariaAl41693608 @davelanger2k @LordAdmiral7558 @kylegriffin1 Love this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LordAdmiral7558 @kylegriffin1 And Trump will slither back into the swamp he came from with his minions close behind.  Yay!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 @UNBREAK64166467 Now, that’s a President!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ebruenig @ifindkarma Oh my goodness.  So sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepublicanSwine He is so childish<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#TrumpLiesPeopleDie #TrumpPandemic #TrumptheWorstPresidentEVER<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump spent the past 30 minutes bragging on himself.   Not solving or reporting on problems.   Tomorrow, when he wakes up he will have at least 2M+ jobless people.    He should have discussed that.   Two sentences of reassurance and back to the hate and raged filled narcissist!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ddale8 President Obama set him up to soar. Unfortunately, he tried so hard to undo everything President Obama when he didn't understand the government. It's so sad. It's so wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where's my violin?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeanniemillar @Yamiche Lol! He's the most perfect narcissist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yamiche Lie number 670,958!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You people???!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why don't the test centers verify that people have symptoms before using a test kit?  It's that simple or should be???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ddale8 @Yamiche He needs to grow up. Does he not know the rules of supply and demand?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ryanstruyk @Yamiche If he spoke with them in January we wouldn't be here now. He is a waste of air and space!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yamiche  https://t.co/KjuxUVjqaq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast How about we can't let the American people get evicted or be hungry. Take care of that first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yamiche He is so hate-filled. I’m surprised he doesn’t explode from the pent up steam.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alan_Peltier @LisaDNews Absolutely, I agree. They need to fight it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MahdaouiRashad @LisaDNews @Yamiche It’s just maddening. He doesn’t know how to work within the government. He just stomps around and acts like a whining baby.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kasie @Yamiche Yes, he should perhaps talk to them. He’s doing nothing here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bobpi31415 @maggieNYT Yes!!  We know Trump’s watching from the shadows.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdgeofSports @maggieNYT @Yamiche Of course.  Narcissist needs it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maggieNYT @Yamiche Absolutely!  @PeterAlexander was 100% correct and somebody got to 45.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crazy!  A good president would have stepped up and found the supplies, drawn up a PO and had the governors contact whomever. Controlling costs, happy governors, happy Americans!  Done deal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elder_jodi Well put!  He is disgusting and ignorant!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RtisticFX @UNBREAK64166467 @MarkHertling @mccaffreyr3 I agree! 🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AdrianeZane @RepublicanSwine @HelenaofTroy60 @maddow @washingtonpost @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer Until tomorrow!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yamiche @PeterAlexander Somebody talked to him. Someone told him he needs to reassure us like @PeterAlexander asked. @PeterAlexander, he’s just a toddler. Excuse him, please. I don’t!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, well, well.  Someone talked to him. He’s trying to reassure us like Peter asked him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plus you don’t play nicely with the other countries. Would you please resign so a grown up can take over?  Thank you. /2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The governors are bumping heads trying to bid for supplies. Bad advice, 45. You need to think really, really hard before you speak. You’re running around creating chaos bc you don’t understand and cannot fully comprehend sapparently, how govt works. /1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I hope you come with answers and information this time.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@seungminkim Selfish, jerk. Wonder if the virus can live in the pool water?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jfreewright And spending days and days discussing bills that would make a difference in our lives. Do they just like to hear each other talk?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeJoPro @RepublicanSwine Been saying the same thing. He’s so arrogant, immature and narcissistic, tho.  It is all his fault. It should memorialized that way. We’re going to pay for this for a while mentally and economically.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @JBPritzker @CNN You freak!    You don’t understand how government works. You tell the governors to order their own supplies and the next day you come back and tell them how many you’ve been able to order. Something is wrong with you!  You are a wate of air!!! #TrumpLiedPeopleDied<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovPritzker @jaketapper Empty promises. Why is there still so much confusion and chaos still?  Still telling lies. This is at 45s level to arrange, not the individual state’s. He could do more for them but he is a lost case!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ReignOfApril @ifindkarma I lost my last baby at the end of January. Both were rescues. This is so difficult without them. I can't adopt another until I fence my yard so I'm really trying to save. I encourage everyone to adopt. They never stop loving you for it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr @realDonaldTrump This should have been done days ago, weeks ago.  You're letting Amercans die because you're sitting on legislation that will help us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenBillCassidy @realDonaldTrump 45, it's just amazing how you now take this seriously NOW.  You are truly at fault Hersh and you're not fooling anyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sunny She's only been in the Senate since January. The governor appointed her and she's running for re-election now. This is truly unbelievable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidfrum @perfume_chick Exactly!  Don't any of them care if we live or die?  If we come between their money Or supporting 45, we definitely get the short end of the stick. We can just die!  FIRE THEM ALL IN NOVEMBER!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JRubinBlogger @funder His news conferences are so uninformative. Filled with general statements (doing an incredible job, I hear, really great things, many things are, we're working...).

<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr Is there anything you or someone can do about Donald Trump referring to COVID-19 as the Chinese Virus?

<|startoftext|>@DrTedros please is there anything WHO can do about Donald Trump using the term Chinese Virus?  It is so unfair and hateful. Many people have asked him to stop but he continues. I know WHO asked that negative terms not be used but he still does it. I am a black American.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pbump @gtconway3d I think he goes to sleep at night and when the demons chase him, he dreams of better places and situations and when he wakes, he thinks it's real.  Has to be dreaming this up because it's not true. Just a deranged mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@raephilson @MSJRedlands @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump They did not do this on purpose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QuancyClayborne No, I trust not. If they do, Trump wins.  He will have finally killed the American family just like he killed the public trust.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DrTedros Thank you for your leadership during this crisis. I understand how difficult and taxing this must be. Your help please. Donald Trump continues to refer to COVID-19 as the "Chinese Virus." Just done on national TV.  Can you please help to stop him?  Please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did 45 just say Chinese Virus on national TV? How can he continue to belittle and use racial slurs?

<|startoftext|>Makes perfect sense and not just from someone’s off-hand thoughts. Thank you so much, @juliettekayyem.  Much needed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenKamalaHarris @realDonaldTrump Will you ever stop blaming someone else? A couple of days ago, we were in this together. Your actions are why we are in this situation.

<|startoftext|>@KamalaHarris My son is a first responder (paramedic) in Atlanta. They dealt with the cruise line passengers and are now in position to handle emergency calls relating to COVID-19. They don’t have enough equipment to handle this.  I am afraid for him but don’t let him know.  I just pray.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So true!  Why don’t some people get it yet?  It’s his fault!  He should have acted in December.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DocFossick @CNN Who does he report to?  They cannot just move without direction. That’s why we have levels of government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN I’m telling you, the governors are our unsung heroes. I thank each and every one of them cleaning up Trump’s mess!  You are saving us! #TrumpIsTheWORSTPresidentEVER<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You need to fix some of this crap we are now living with. You’ve made so many bad decisions that a 12 year old could do better. The way you’re running us into the swamp is heartbreaking, sad, irresponsible and unforgivable. Get out!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ezraklein And they state something that refutes everything 45 is saying. But that’s after they build 45’s ego after he screwed everything up in the beginning. We are so vulnerable to anything right now because of that idiot!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump How many lost their lives in Iraq today?  How many died because you don’t understand the word pandemic or how to govern?

<|startoftext|>@CNN @realDonaldTrump where is he getting them?  Have you found out?  Are you in contact regarding sourcing?  Any new news on the US government’s supply?  Do something instead of flying back and forth between DC and FL playing golf. #TrumpPlague<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse Too little, too late!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @Mike_Pence @CDCgov Why didn’t you admit your fault in this in the beginning? You left us vulnerable AND PEOPLE ARE DYING. This is not a game, not a joke!

<|startoftext|>@OPM4everNot @TrumpWarRoom @TeamTrump @Mike_Pence We do not as human beings deserve this. Trump needs to be forthcoming.

<|startoftext|>@OPM4everNot @TrumpWarRoom @TeamTrump @Mike_Pence Of course. If we don’t admit wrong and are not truthful about it, leaving an entire country vulnerable, I would expect to be called on it.Especially since it effected so many.

<|startoftext|>He could not be less concerned with us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never. 45 is in over his head that I don't think he can dig his way out ever. He is taking us into the abyss, into the swamp, into recession head first. Nov can't come soon enough. He has no gov experience, doesn't believe what scientists tell him and is too narcissistic to learn<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid Thank God!  We need a different perspective to survive all the changes after this scare is over. Trump is not going to give it to us. He will go back to his mean, degrading, ugly tweets. Causing division and negative feelings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@washingtonpost This would be funny if it wasn't so scary detrimental. 45 needs to listen, give others the ability to do their jobs, believe the science and stop sending hate-filled tweets and making hate-filled statements. We need better administration to pull us out of this. #TrumpCoronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Suzy18119142 No, didn't think it was. Absolutely agree with you. They decided. Yes, we need human decisions now, not party.  Good luck through this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Suzy18119142 I’m not arguing that everything Obama did was 100% correct. My concern is the divides he loves to create.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ElizLanders @Acosta @LindseyGrahamSC Girl, I’m praying for you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am still really bothered by 45 giving the Medal of Honor to Rush Limbaugh. Limbaugh did not deserved it.  He is A racist, bigoted, lying,  cowardly monster. Can the medal be taken away from him? #RushLimbaugh #MEDALRUSH #TrumpNotFitForOffice<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@joncoopertweets @lesleyabravanel Absolutely!!  I've been sending him a tweet a day stating that it is all his fault and the sick and families of those passing should sue him. It's all on his shoulders. He had 6 weeks notice but he doesn't how the government works, therefore, we suffer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ddale8 When he lies, he repeats himself. Great example.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump His numbers outweigh human life. He's probably hiding some affected citizens to keep his numbers low.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBCNews @vp Yes, there has been irresponsible rhetoric by your boss!  He made all this worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBCNews Are you kidding? @VP Trump is the one guilty of this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FronOcia @washingtonpost And so begins the recession.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@happysuzie100 @washingtonpost Have we been?  Did something change overnight?  Has it been truthful?  I think not and that is truly unfortunate for our country. We are too great for what 45 is doing. He doesn't understand how government works to our disadvantage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iudex57 @washingtonpost The executive narcissist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lesleyabravanel Absolutely!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@funder He made a fool of himself again. Now, Europe is upset with him. His plan for funding those effected by COVID-19 will really start the recession and the deficit is already at an all-time high. Just get rid of 45, please. He is just embarrassingly dumb.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Strandjunker @realDonaldTrump @kilmeade @foxandfriends The narcissist does not care about us!<|endoftext|>
