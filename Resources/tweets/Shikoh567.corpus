<|startoftext|>@Inquilabo @jagritysablok1 Be careful when choosing friends. One is a wolf in sheep's skin and the other is an open outright wolf. We really need another alternative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jagritysablok1 I agree that Muslims, dalits and all sane minded people need to unite against Hindutva and its henchmen. It's no longer a choice but an existential issue. Let's embark on a campaign to raise the awareness of the real face of Hindutva in the whole world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jagritysablok1 That's a high risk gamble. History shows that economic hardship makes people selfish. In extremes, it can also lead to anarchy, chaos, xenophobia and ethnic cleansing. We need to raise awareness amongst the masses and bring down these lunatics before they destroy the nation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jagritysablok1 I disagree and sincerely hope it doesn't happen. I wouldn't want to see my country totally destroyed, more innocent people lynched, population polarised and the fabric of the nation and its democracy damaged beyond redemption.

<|startoftext|>@BlackLover_1626 The reason and context is unclear but Tbh I don't care. Nothing justifies such violence and particularly four men attacking one woman!
