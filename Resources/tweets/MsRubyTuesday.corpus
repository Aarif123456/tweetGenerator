<|startoftext|>@CBSNews blame it on Pelosi... she is the one that insist millions be given to planned parenthood to fund abortions- which clearly has NOTHING to do with the working adults who are unemployed due to the Governors forcing unemployment under the guise of Covid-19<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dsminla1 @CountyVentura my point is Ventura County - #CDC &amp; #WHO along with the rest of the USA is intentionally allowing coronavirus to exist - if they TRULY wanted to stop the spread - they would FACTUALLY #Quarantine EVERYONE who test positve rather than force the #healthy to wear a mask &amp; not work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dsminla1 @CountyVentura if you say so... but reality is never false- even now- not one person who test positive is FACTUALLY #quarantined in a qualified facility- they are just sent home- &amp; allowed to go shopping!-my coworker went to a BBQ in oxnard-got it- was sent home &amp; she infected her entire family<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dsminla1 @CountyVentura the fact is they were only isolated 1 day and sent home- They were sent to Point Magu because Costa Mesa succesfully kept them from being housed at a hotel- in Feb- the patients were distributed to every navy base across the USA- 10-12 patients each to allow infection to spread<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dsminla1 @CountyVentura my sources? common knowledge- they 1st arrived in Feb- just type in google search engine "coronavirus patients imported to Ventura County Navy Base"- the point I am making is NO ONE WHO HAS TESTED POSITIVE (even now) has been FACTUALLY #Quarantined allowing the spread #plandemic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dsminla1 @CountyVentura yes- 10 months in -since Ventura County intentionally imported 12 people who were infected from the cruise ship... to the Navy Base &amp; did not factually #Quarantine them- just sent them home- even now- those who test positve are still just sent home to infect others....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ABC7 nope- she will become the "1st female of ethnic combination" chosen SOLELY for VP due to her Gender/Ethnicity-NOT qualifications (No man was considered for the job) &amp; she will be PRESIDENT after #Biden is medically removed-thank goodness now the cities can take down their boards!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TMZ hey @TMZ how come when a cop drags a WHITE Teen over concrete- not only do you fail to describe the color of their skin?- but you won't even report it??? what is with the obvious intent to only draw attention to "Black Injustices"?- headline should be cop drags teen over concrete<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealCandaceO tho I agree no pregnant woman wants to share a bathroom with a man pissing inches away... I would be more concerned that you are experiencing "morning sickness" at 7 months of pregnancy... make an appointment with your doctor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KTLAMorningNews yeh... right after her next hair appointment...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMZ the law is clear- you are REQUIRED to have ID on you at all times in public-(and that is because if you are found in need of medical care /end up in a hospital/ need to prove who you are) - no one feels bad for anyone who plays that "I don't need to show my ID " game to the PD.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KTLAMorningNews not 1... not 2... but 3 lil boys. #Scumbag - If I was one of the parents of those lil boys- I would be sure to learn which jail he will be going to for that short sentence he receives &amp; put money on the books.... of the meanest jailmate there... #JusticeIsNotAlwaysObtainedInCourt<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheRealJohnHCox @Disney and yet that SOB begs for money from TRUMP to cover the fires that were avoidable...  I voted for you- but yeh- unfortunately Newsom won in spite of his evil Aunt... Disney should've just made a cartoon about him &amp; Pelosi #TheEvilBloodline<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PhilipScalione @hodgetwins I took 2 years law enforcement at Golden West College &amp; did 1 year of ride alongs w/ Westminster PD- Officer Robert Burnett was the officer who explained the theory of shooting the criminal in the leg to increase the odds of getting them to court where they could be prosecuted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanMadonia it is still a great song! :-D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hodgetwins I am voting #Trump2020 but- the statement "Aim 4 the leg" is how I was trained when I considered being a P.O. - the theory is: if you shoot em in the leg- they can't run/they are forced to be in court &amp; prosecuted with a bullet hole to remind them for life regardless of outcome!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Elex_Michaelson he is 100% correct- no matter what we vote for- even when it passes- we do NOT get to see it happen...

<|startoftext|>@ABC7 yeh that should be good... I mean- all those little girls who were forced to "try" the HPV shots are still suffering from that decision...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ksorbs The way I see it- Since #WHO refuses to factually #Quarantine those who test positve- &amp; just send them home to infect everyone (that has been forced to stay home from work /school during lockdown) - then we should be able to resume our lives &amp; do our best to remain healthy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I've never replaced my brakes (disc in front drums in back) on my Nissan GXE ever... &amp; I've had the car for over 20 yrs now- so after painting it- I decided to buy it new brakes &amp; have the calipers/drums painted red.üòä<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ABC7 has anyone protested her boyfriend yet??? I mean- If I had a boyfriend whose actions caused me to get killed in my own home by police- I would hope someone would sue the boyfriend &amp; draw light to the fact he was the cause of of all the flying bullets.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@4everSkylarr @mrcertified4 @yerbs7 I did not chastise the victim...

<|startoftext|>@4everSkylarr @mrcertified4 @yerbs7 In California- IF you do not have a DL- you ARE required to have a California ID card issued by DMV after the age of 18- Banks/Planes/Apartments/Hotels... &amp; even some jobs require government issued ID's<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hypoculese @TMZ Don't be an idiot-- IF they lost their ID- or are in the process of getting a new one- all they need to do is simply tell the officer their name &amp; date of birth- they can type it in their database &amp; learn if you are you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dawnparagracias @TMZ As a rule-the PD only responds that way when they feel they need to-heck-I got slammed to the ground by 5 police officers in the 80s w/ knees on my back-because the truck I bought had been reported as stolen 6 months prior... once it was clear I did not steal it- they let me up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrcertified4 @yerbs7 Mr Certified- rapist will rape you even if you are wearing a sweatsuit their actions are based on violence-not what you are wearing- don't put words in my mouth-but-yes- some people do have negative encounters with the PD due to their actions towards the PD- #NoReasonNotToComply<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoeHH76 @Oseaivy @TMZ you're right- your not "required" -unless the PD believes you may be an accessory: EG: drugs/weapons found in car etc- it then qualifies as PC148 obstruction/resisting -<|endoftext|>

I'm not afraid to show my ID when asked for it- even when it resulted in my going to jail for 7 months- w/ 5 yrs probation for simply for telling the truth on my personal website.... which as it turns out- under the 1st ammendment was not illegal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yerbs7 @TMZ I didn't "justify" a cop beating anyone... I meerly pointed out- some people encounter that scenario due to their own actions...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Oseaivy @TMZ you are correct sir- this is not Nazi Germany- it is California... &amp; the reason we are REQUIRED to carry that silly little ID is because if you are rushed to the hospital- or worse found dead they know who you are... it also is REQUIRED when using a credit card in stores...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atlhawks2000 @qveenhq @angelic_lady81 @TMZ (here in CA) it IS the law a person must always carry ID when walking/driving in public- &amp; IF anyone gets pulled over ALL passengers are REQUIRED to show THEIR ID as well. - Yes- you can refuse to give your name/show ID - but- as a rule its easier just to show the ID.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@qveenhq @angelic_lady81 @TMZ you hope I get beat up by a cop?- for pointing out the law???- EVERYONE is REQUIRED to carry an ID- it is WHY we have one-but- if makes you feel better- I spent 7 months in jail for embarrassing political cartoonist Jim Day in 2001- &amp; guess what I didn't factually break the law-<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMZ when I get pulled over- for just a faded out license plate... all my passengers were required to show thieir ID as well... due to the fact- some passengers (unbeknownst to you) are on probation/parole/have warrant/drugs/are REQUIRED by law to carry ID. Bottomline: Carry Your ID<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ABC7 of course she did... it is the standard answer of EVERY criminal to buy 10 yrs of court dates... the problem is -there is no law that states "if you are guilty admit it  - if you claim to be "Not Guilty" and you are- it is an automatic 20 yrs in prison."<|endoftext|>

FTR- EVERYONE loses 100 or more strands of hair DAILY- &amp;- for every day of non shampooing add an extra 100- EG: 3 days no shampoo= 300 strands in the brush #Cosmetolgy101<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gee... @GavinNewsom can fund gift cards to criminals being let out of jail due to #COVID19 - yet- can't supply the extra $100 for the #unemployment to the law abiding citizens he won't allow to go to work...<|endoftext|>
