<|startoftext|>@WokeAFMedia 1/3 Why do I say it? to normalise without admitting I am scared. Cause to acknowledge my fear means I have to change my behaviour and that is too much. Women should be safe walking anywhere.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@auspost still no idea where my parcels are? And now I’m being to get the sender to contact AP when the stuff up is yours?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hi @BickmoreCarrie hoping you can help share this to support Joel in his battle with brain cancer  https://t.co/i05MaevbTn. My beautiful friend Steph is doing everything she can to make their lives easier.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@auspost Why would I make this up? What benefit is it to me? I cannot believe the way you treat customers. This issue has been going on for 5 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@auspost Seriously I called yesterday &amp; your staff told me to wait &amp; watch for a status update as the app is the most up to date. The call is recorded so you don’t have to take my word for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@auspost Think of how easy this would be if AP just delivered the parcels correctly. I pay for a service &amp; you provide it. Pretty simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@auspost I have also asked for a transfer repeatedly &amp; keep being told to go to YPO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@auspost Yesterday I was told the app was the most accurate source. Is that not true either?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@auspost Your app shows it’s gone back into “it’s coming” status. I’ve sent screenshots several times now.  https://t.co/jW82hbMZo5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have also asked for a transfer several times yesterday &amp; today &amp; have been continually told to go to Yarraville PO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@auspost Really? My parcel is missing &amp; the DM response is not resolving that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@auspost My parcel is now missing, not at the locker, not a lot the PO. What’s the deal with that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@auspost first you don’t deliver parcels when I’m home, now you don’t deliver to my parcel locker? Why even tell me to set one up?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@metrotrains what is happening with trains williamstown/werribee, no trains stopping at Seddon, no announcements?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glennmcgrath11 not good enough - we've all had difficult times but we don't all go shoot an elephant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty sure that running every train late is not good service @metrotrains  http://t.co/O63FyJUhML<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love the new @metrotrains strategy of running every train late 2-5 mins. Brilliant who needs a timetable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JetstarAirways is there anyway of finding out when flight is departing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JetstarAirways how hard is it to let passengers know. This is my first &amp; last flight with Jetstar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JetstarAirways we could have stayed at our hotel. Air Asia were bad but they at least advised us of changes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you @JetstarAirways delay our flight but don't bother to notify us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AirAsia  http://t.co/BNmVnH2MYn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AirAsia media is reporting no direct flights MEL-DPS but we were sold direct flights. No one will help us?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@metrotrains maybe tell people before they get on the train, can I get my fare refunded?<|endoftext|>
