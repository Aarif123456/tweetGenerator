<|startoftext|>@DaxGigandet Of course.  Because I also use the seat belt in a car.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TSicarii @DiamondLynne1 @pinkheretic I like you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiamondLynne1 11, 11 and then, to shake it up a bit, yes you guessed it - 11.  And yes, I'd watch them all one after the other!  https://t.co/nou94QXXFS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Palwanda Ist das nicht einer der üblichen Witze? Dass man sich in Deutschland nicht grüßt?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Palwanda Man könnte sagen Alman Level 99 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AiG With your line of argument it follows, that you really believe in Zeus AND Odin AND Mbombo AND the FSM - you just don't believe that you believe in them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meckernfueralle  https://t.co/8DKIw62OHw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marczimmermann I feel you. Although it may not be for the same reason, but I do have that feeling today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@02deebo First my body will be donated to the local university for medical students to have proper (😉) human specimen to study on. Here they cremate the remains and hold a ceremony once a year at which one can chose to be mentioned or, in my case, not be mentioned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kim The Madame Tussauds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiamondLynne1 310 km, but it used to be 10756 km.  Those were wonderful times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Brokenstill50 Always one, isn't that what drinking alone means?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankPKing Interestingly, you stumbled upon one of my all-time favourites.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkinAtheist I do think so, yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CA_AstroComm I'm sorry I don't/can't take the time to ❤️ all women in this thread.  Please know that you all are respected, no matter how many mediocre men here try to downplay your hard work and achievements.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toronodon @StevenDorsher @CA_AstroComm Funny that, huh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CynicalMinion And a good thing that you didn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoldenerAluhut 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂  Und kaum teuer als ins Kino zu gehen  https://t.co/g5vEcuOIV7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gotta love #Canada!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CynicalMinion I didn't know that... But Google did help just now so I don't need to ask and you don't need to answer.  I hope you "served" them what they needed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CynicalMinion I only really know a few things myself, but I'd guess my most favourite and useful bits are:  dos cervezas por favor  and  pendejo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CynicalMinion Oh, there goes my reminder to not assume stuff.  Just assumed you skipped Google because it's so bad 🤦‍♂️ my bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CynicalMinion Wow, Google sucks bad, doesn't it?  What it says is: And they call that a "hard" #lockdown! Ridiculous.  Fuck you!  Because, once again, they just pretend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤣😂🤣😂🤣 Und das nennen die einen "harten" #lockdown! Lächerlich.  Fickt euch!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ivery5000 No. She's only crying because she lost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DocAtCDI To be there for each other whenever needed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiamondLynne1 That's great!  We were just talking about how you'd be doing now.  We're glad to hear that you're back, we sincerely are.  Happy hugs from all of us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickyfabiyi Absolutely understandable!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mithos1987 👏👏👏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRocsWorld @OaxacaChaka Ah! Now I get it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DocAtCDI I'll be on my way then...  https://t.co/MpmbYWrlpo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder I can only hope for the best for all of them.  My best wishes to you and your family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rak_strong Yep.  3 items of 3 different relationships.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logosaetos  https://t.co/nViz67hhIC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OrmPosting Ja'loja - viking style.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DocAtCDI And I even would send you some, honestly. Trouble is, that you live in the US and I happen to know that their customs regulations would not be too happy about my weaponized chilli. 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rak_strong Yeah, no worries. Snow may look nice in pictures or on TV, but in real life it's white shite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DocAtCDI I received 13 kg of dear and wild boar from our local hunter.  Then I went to bed. Both very good things. Now that I'm up again, I'm making chili... Also a very good thing.  I don't know, I just like my life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rak_strong Same.  What a crappy season, that winter thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aelurotheist Kerbal irgendwas...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PermissiontoQ In what cases is murdering someone fine?  The predetermined act of killing a person is murder.  Also, human rights.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidVeillon5 @needreset2020 @logosaetos 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logosaetos 🤣 You make it sound like a bad thing...  It's true, though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OrmPosting Arvid may be strong, but he is as sweet as he is strong and in this particular fight this would be his disadvantage.<|endoftext|>

I shall think of all you people enjoying your weekend while I shall be on duty.  Nightshift! Yeah! 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rbdwarf @drhingram @NikkEffingham But apparently, not bad enough for future people to come and stop it. Makes you wonder what happens next. Next as in, between the future and now, of course.  And the invention of the time machine can't be that far away now, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IMomalogues Sleep? What's that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irina_florescu @therealkong4 @savage_purpose @GhostOfJustin1 Yep.  Just like it would raise a few eyebrows if a doctor just came to check on a patient...  I know it's not exactly the same, but I hope it shows why I see a problem if a cop were called somewhere on duty and the situation took a turn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealkong4 @savage_purpose @GhostOfJustin1 If so, that'd be severe misconduct, if not rape.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Marcus_mit_Zeh Zuckerguss.  Die mit Puderzucker sind nervig.  Ich hatte aber noch nie welche mit Apfelmus/Zimt/Zucker Füllung. 🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GhostOfJustin1 Worse? Are you implying having sex in a car in a parking lot is a bad thing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DocAtCDI Leaking secrets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NuckChorris16 Oh... So, a catholic website?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tachyon100 All or any Harry Potter.  I was so annoyed by the hype. Whenever a new one came out you couldn't even go the the cinema anymore. Out of twelve theaters 10 showed Harry and the other two showed yet another Asian horror movie. And it was the same in all cinemas!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NuckChorris16 Cool. I don't even know what you're talking about, so I guess I'm fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dave_O_Leary77 It's baffling to think that people's attitude changes just because someone is out. As if you changed or became a different person...  You're right, though, sadly it wasn't going to be easy. But you're out now, the rest is on the others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiamondLynne1 That looks weird, but what you describe sounds bad and the possibility of long term effects, like nerve permanent damage, are what make this virus so bad even when one survives it.  I really hope you're through it soon.  Hold on, we love you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AwardsDarwin The blue man group protesting veganism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LadyThal1a @gunsnrosesgirl3 Nice!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@allesgeschizzl Ja, den Film anzusehen hat mich auch um mindestens 10 Jahre altern lassen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HenryRambow It requires thought, that's just too hard for some people 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Nicoism_ @ExGOPer @cruciataultima @OrgPhysics How are "subjective experience" or "human experience" tough questions?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaugustinej @bonsaibean2 @__Helicon__ You don't believe in not believing?  Can you spell oxymoron?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaugustinej @bonsaibean2 @__Helicon__ No. It just is a position of not accepting your kind of "explanation" because 1. there is no evidence to support it and 2. it doesn't even explain anything.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@XianJaneway The denobulan relationship model.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logosaetos Say, is it a bit of work to become a doctor? Or: Why didn't you just use Google, like all those "smart" people nowadays, like #antivaxxers and #COVIDIOTS?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Elishabenabuya Never seen it. Now I'm happy I didn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkinAtheist Oh yeah! I'd send you a Pic of my wife but she wouldn't like that...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Talija8189 Ach so! Cool.  Schön, wenn man nebenbei noch was machen kann. Freut mich für dich.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aelurotheist Ja, oder? Plötzlich wollen die alle einen haben.  Ist wie damals mit den Hinkelsteinen. Die sind aber leider aus der Mode gekommen. Was schade ist, weil die doch so praktisch waren, die konnte man überall hinstellen.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kevin_ketzer 🤣😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RexChapman @JoeBiden This man deserves a medal! Seriously. I know he didn't kill too many terrorists or flew a drone over Pakistan, no, he is a bright moment in the lives of people on his route.  Talk about healing a country - people like him do that every day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevin_ketzer Ja, tut mir leid, mein Französisch ist nicht wirklich salonfähig. 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JumpimitRose 🤣😂 Komisch wenn man merkwürdig ist weil man die merkwürdigen Sachen nicht mitmacht.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CynicalMinion @Stop_Trump20 Yep. 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CynicalMinion @Stop_Trump20 He deserves all the ouchies they can bring.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CynicalMinion @Stop_Trump20 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣 Then they really messed up his hair and face!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CynicalMinion I remember the story of the mice, yes. They were all wrong, not?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuraSegretario Ich hab bis vorhin noch gedacht, dass das Du als Beleidigung eh nicht reicht - habe aber doch etwas Neues gelernt...  Ich selbst sehe es auch nicht als Beleidigung. Nur halt als Ausdruck von Nähe und Vertrautheit - welche ich in einer solchen Situation unangebracht finde.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stop_Trump20 A blacked over arm sounds good, I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CynicalMinion Okay, comparative theology.  Do the different theologies agree with each other? Of course not, then they wouldn't be different.  So, if they don't agree, and they can't all be right, we would have to conclude that at least some of them are false. Not?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CynicalMinion A choice? Can you choose to believe something?  How would that work?  Can you choose to believe in the tooth fairy? Can you choose to believe in Mbombo?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@allesgeschizzl Sehe ich auch so.  Man könnte jetzt blauäugig fragen warum in solchen Situationen Distanz gewahrt werden soll, abe rich glaube das versteht man ganz leicht.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CynicalMinion You seem to still think that atheism means to claim that there is no god.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CynicalMinion And here is where I would earnestly ask you to please tell me if you found me to be wrong.  I really would like the things I believe to be true. If I believed something wrong or for wrong reasons and you could help me see that, I would highly value your help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CynicalMinion Which is why theology isn't a big fan of asking questions. Which would make it wrong according to your own definition.  The rest I fully agree with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CynicalMinion Nope, not much of a difference.  Different only in that the bible already giving quite clear points on what god is like and is thus easily shown as false and the non-defined higher power is to vague to even address as a subject.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CynicalMinion No it isn't. To answer "Do you believe in a god?" with "I don't know." isn't an answer.  I would agree with you there and if I ever meet such an atheist I'll tell them so myself.  That's exactly what atheists are saying all the time when faced with: Then prove there's no god!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KampfzwergJoddy 🤣😂🤣😂 Das wäre ein cooler Look für jede ComicCon!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KampfzwergJoddy Nicht schlecht. Ich hoffe es hält lange an 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CynicalMinion Also, no personal experience is needed to find one's way out of faith.  Seems though as if many people who find faith have done so through a personal experience they can't explain, so they opted for the good old god of the gaps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CynicalMinion Okay... Just to avoid future misunderstandings.  The both words are answers to two different questions.  Is there a god? I don't know.         Yes./No. Agnostic.               Gnostic.  Do you believe in a god? No.              Yes. Atheist.       Theist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CynicalMinion Wait, what?  Please elaborate on what you see the difference is between atheist and agnostic.  Also, what do you mean you don't think anybody is wrong?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JumpimitRose Götter nein, sowas kann ja auch nicht gut enden!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KampfzwergJoddy 😳 Was ne Frage...  Da bin ich jetzt echt neugierig wie du aussiehst.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiamondLynne1 Glad to hear that.  Btw, @Bowrie sends her best, too.  She wasn't able to see your tweets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoeckelRene Gerne!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Palaeo3D 🤣😂🤣😂🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoeckelRene Krass!  Aber, heh, gewonnen. 👍  Und die Kohle wäre eh an den Staat gegangen, dann kann Papa Staat auch der Kohle hinterher laufen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Palaeo3D Fehlender Respekt ist eine strafbare Handlung, oder zumindest eine Owi?!  Bayern?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heaven_nurse Ah, danke!  Es scheint doch ein paar mehr Leute zu geben, die sich davon nicht so gestört fühlen würden.  Spannend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoeckelRene So nervig ich unhöfliches Dutzen finde - das wage ich zu bezweifeln.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BRijswijk @CynicalMinion Yep, that's what you and I agree on. But I'm certain you have heard theists twist this into their idea of what atheism means and go from there.  Thia is what has been the basis for their attempt to explain how atheism isn't the default.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KampfzwergJoddy Ja, Schweden ist berühmt dafür, gelle?  Jemanden zu dutzen nur weil ich sie für jünger halte, fände ich auch eher merkwürdig. Sicher, bei Kindern ist komischerweise völlig normal. 🤷‍♂️  Aber wenn jemand im Teenagerbereich ist, schalte ich automatisch auf Sie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@macmac01011964 @nbcsnl @freddyatton I'm not sure that's a left vs right issue.  I only am absolutely certain that Trump is an embarrassing specimen of humans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sergiorahmsos @Stormageddon666 🤔 Okay...  Der Ton macht die Musik, unabhängig von sie oder du. Soweit bin ich natürlich voll bei dir.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sergiorahmsos Ah, mal eine andere Sichtweise! Danke!  Im Französischen, Russischen und im Thai wird da allerdings auch ein Unterschied gemacht. 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@laumilumpf Moment, du meinst gerade, dass eine zu kontrollierende Person die Beamten duzt? Das passiert natürlich regelmäßig und da wird dann einfach mal vorausgesetzt, dass die Beamten über den Dingen stehen (na klar 🙄).  Nee, ich meinte einen Beamten der Beteiligte so anquatscht.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CynicalMinion That is absolutely what they are getting at. The lie that atheism means to believe that there is no god. But that would be like believing that there is no invisible blue cat sitting next to you... The whole notion is ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@macmac01011964 @nbcsnl @freddyatton Yes, I do. This kind of joke has been thrown around for the last years and, of course, there is no direct evidence for it. But the pictures of them do look very inappropriate and he obviously is a vile person with a very suspicious group of "friends".  You know, if it quacks...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Palaeo3D Stimme zu.  Allerdings, wie sollte die Strafe dann begründet sein? Also, was sollte da bestraft werden?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevin_ketzer @DieMeZi @KonHaubner 😂🤣🤣😂🤣  Sehr praktisch, ja. Und wenn's 3. Person plural sein soll lass ich das gerne durchgehen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevin_ketzer @DieMeZi @KonHaubner Stimmt. Im Kindergarten waren wir alle nur Muttis und Vatis, aber der Schule war die Welt wieder normal.  Sie, solange man sich nicht wirklich kannte, Du wenn man gut mit einander klarkam - alle Anderen bleiben Sie.  Lehrer, immer Sie, selbst wenn man sie mag.  Seh ich so 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kevin_ketzer @DieMeZi @KonHaubner Das Einzige womit ich auch im "normalen" Geschäftsverkehr noch immer nicht klarkomme ist, in der 3. Person angesprochen zu werden. Z.B.: "Hat er alles gefunden was er braucht?"  Da könnte ich jedes Mal ausklinken.  Standardantwort ist natürlich: "WIR haben alles gefunden, ja."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaAntifascist @atheist_bad Agreed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@klausfenn @UdoGuengerich Na gut, das stimmt auffallend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaAntifascist @atheist_bad Oh, right.  Yeah, it doesn't always have to be the throwing dishes/killing each other type.  I once was scolded by a friend because I called those dads, who make dating rules for their daughters or "playful" threats to their daughter's boyfriend, jealous.  That's "soft" jealousy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@The_Lady_Red @johnny_queer Now that's how it's supposed to go!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaAntifascist @atheist_bad I still don't see a good form of it. As I still think the coveting you described is more along the lines of envy. To want something one doesn't have.  Granted, one doesn't own a person, so jealousy may be called envy, because one wants to possess that other person. But is it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Everybodys_Mum 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂  That's a tough kid there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaAntifascist @atheist_bad Ah, okay. That I would register under envy. As in, I would like to have what someone else has. Generally not a nice emotion, but as you said, there are soft forms.  Jealousy being possessive is one of the problems I have with it. I cannot imagine to possess another person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stormageddon666 @hexaOrthorexia Oder wie mein Kind sagt: Isso!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stormageddon666 @hexaOrthorexia So wahr.  https://t.co/GP7vYLM70o<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@twatschi Ich würde fast vermuten, dass würde diesen Menschen gar nicht stören.  Insofern... Sind wir vielleicht doch nur zu konservativ und er ist uns da voraus? 🤯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaAntifascist @atheist_bad 🤔 For example?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TechNoir80s @RandomMnky I also was wondering about the apparent lack of it.  But, here we are, defending realism in science fiction. 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@klausfenn @UdoGuengerich Oder? Ist schon merkwürdig. Irgendwie... Wie Versteckte Kamera oder so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hexaOrthorexia @Stormageddon666 Versteh ich. Allerdings bin ich hier im Internet rein privat unterwegs, da erwarte ich (in Sachen Förmlichkeit) nur ordentliche Grammatik und ordentlichen Ausdruck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stormageddon666 Jawoll. Seh ich auch so. Ich wollte nur sicherstellen, dass meine Bubble mir da zustimmt.  😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nordvvind Muss ich mal nachschlagen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OnkelBlogs @KonHaubner Daher auch meine Reaktion wenn ich so geduzt werde: Kennen wir uns? Hatten wir schon'mal ne Orgie zusammen?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DGehirnwurm @DieMeZi @KonHaubner Was ja im Endeffekt weiterhin das Sie wäre.  Ich glaube damit könnte ich gut leben, ja.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DieMeZi @KonHaubner Eben. Reine Höflichkeit, oder?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UdoGuengerich 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nordvvind Ja! Oh, das würde ich eigentlich ganz gerne mal hören! Nur um mich dann vor Lachen wegzuwerfen.  So wie ich jahrelang in der Eifel darauf gewartet habe, dass ein Polizist mich mal festholt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KonHaubner Ich hab auch schon überlegt ob ich da etwas Konservatives an mir entdeckt habe...  Aber ja, ich denke auch, dass ein Verwaltungsakt nicht mit einem Du beginnt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mal 'ne Frage an die Deutschsprachigen: Wir hören inzwischen immer häufiger das Du statt des förmlichen Sie im Alltag. Wie würdet Ihr es empfinden wenn ein Beamter euch zu einer Kontrolle anhält und Euch geradewegs duzt?  Hab das jetzt 2mal erlebt und finde es sehr befremdlich 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NiggaAtheist Nope, just praising. All day, every day - for at least one eternity.  Thus, no. Only Lucifer does that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bon_aparte_ @oezgeschmoezge @wanderhakan 😂🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Nordvvind Aber, cooler Pulli.  Ich hatte gerade dieses Zucken im Finger gleich danach zu suchen...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@iam_ThePaulo I have no clue what's happening there...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PermissiontoQ Yeah, annoying as hell. And nowadays it's the supposedly strong woman who does things on her own - things that turn out to have been completely wrong or just irrational.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhotoJennBo 😂🤣 Oh we've done that! Overdid it. I'm so over mushrooms right now!  Ask me again in a year or so...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hq_thekonsept You people... They're annoying, huh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhotoJennBo I'm fine, I'll be off work in a few hours and then a lazy afternoon with the family.  Depending on the weather maybe a longer walk through the woods.  Yeah, walk. No bike. 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhotoJennBo Oh dear, I was just about to say: Hi, we haven't had a chat in a long time and how are you? and then there's this video. I'm sorry... I'm just gonna say: Hi! Have a good sunday!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darinnstacy I wonder who photoshopped my house into this spider's home?  Then, of course, I go  https://t.co/z0vNwT5NtP<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jamie_Foxworthy No matter what happens, ever, don't call the cops.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pontifex The nasty religion you sell to the gullible is pro slavery.  So, be honest and shut the show down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reb_profess @_Mark1966 @Pontifex Oh, that changes everything, of course. Remember that part when Jesus says "Do not keep slaves!"  No? Me neither.  Or when Paul wrote slaves should be free of their masters? Oh, that neither?!  This boring old "NT better than OT nonsense"...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jamie_Foxworthy Oh, nevermind, I just read your answer to the other comment there.  Do not call the cops.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jamie_Foxworthy Did you call the cops yet?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>How wrong can one be?  A "tabula rasa mind", by definition, does not believe in a god because the concept isn't yet put there. No belief in a god = #atheist  But nice self-debunk. Thanks.  Also, what are you talking about?! Most new born animals would die if left alone!  e.g.  https://t.co/N6kDwiGaFr<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@atheist_bad Jealousy.  It never did any good and quite frankly it only makes the jealous person look untrustworthy.  I am of the opinion that jealous people are/would be the unfaithful ones, if given the option or chance.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Stop_Trump20 Never enough...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiamondLynne1 Oh, no. Now that it's there, crap that's worrying.  Take good care of yourself please. You know how to do that.  And do not worry about not getting shit done in the house (as I've heard from some ppl) there's plenty of time to do that afterwards.  We're with you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Nordvvind Freut mich für dich! Jede negative Nachricht ist eine gute Nachricht, gelle?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyKaffee Ich selbst würde da auch schon ein paar Hunderter drauflegen...  🤔 Allerdings wären das nur Geschenke für mich selbst, da in meiner Umgebung keiner wirklich dafür empfänglich wäre.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Howsito I'll be a CIA analyst who reads books in order to find ideas for techniques or procedures that may be employed in the agency and then my whole team gets murdered while I'm out to lunch and in the aftermath I unearth a conspiracy wich then is published in the news or not?  🤔 Nah.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mork_v Quite a few people yes. Of the family I was born into, those who are left after some troubled times. The family I was lucky enough to make, my wife and child that is.

<|startoftext|>@ThatEricAlper Musing about humanity as a social experiment that is getting very interesting at the moment, as we are now at a point when we could either move towards an enlightened society à la Star Trek or we just drive ourselves into extinction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eliz2Vargas I would, yes.  But I don't really see the point to do so. It's not like they can give me anything relevant to the way I live or how I see myself and others.  We're all human and we all originated in Africa.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Nasir19652 @ZwiebeIfisch @alex_nman Da wir verantwortungvolles Handeln seit März versuchen und jetzt sehen wohin wir damit gekommen sind, können wir wohl kategorisch ablehnen, dass das am besten sei.

<|startoftext|>@LoveLaTiyah @JohannesBusch6 I don't understand how that was even a question, but since I don't want to be negative about this I would like to say: Good decision!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DaxGigandet They are a large group of people. With every kind of human being represented within that group.

<|startoftext|>@ichbindabomb The country.  I wouldn't step into the US if you paid me to.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Borgziege @Kyno_Sura Haha 41%! Aber die Kommentare 🤦‍♂️  https://t.co/DJQBUmC4rC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whomeverett @YouTube You tricksed me! (you can't believe how hard my autocorrect fought me on this one)  This was no song. But I watched it, being a Coppola and all. Now I'm wondering, what the hell did I just watch?  But! "they looked at each other with the hatred of disappointment" Nice line.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whomeverett @DazzDzatron @Sven_Sational70 Yes, sir!  https://t.co/7NuAw9Ptym<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whomeverett @Sven_Sational70 For a second there I almost asked which song that would be, but then I remembered, it doesn't even matter.  It still is true, no matter who sings a Christmas song, I would probably find it annoying. Even Eazy-E once did a Christmas thing, I think...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KonHaubner Mantel 👍 Schnee iiiiiihhhhhh!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sven_Sational70 All of them. Don't even need to know any titles, just all of them.  Christmas is so annoying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meckernfueralle Lecker!  https://t.co/wYNca64e3y<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamDoctorOK @atheist_bad @MichelDKerrigan I have.  Every single one of them had some kind of experience they couldn't explain. Meaning, in a nutshell their "reason" to believe was: "I don't know, therefore god."  And to anyone not afflicted that is just sad.  Do you happen to have any reason to believe?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atheist_bad @iamDoctorOK @MichelDKerrigan I don't think she is, no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@valabg Ein Beispiel: Ich komme gerade vor meinem Haus an, in jeder Hand jeweils 2 volle Carrefour-Tüten. Mein Nachbar sitzt vor dem Haus und fragt: Warst Du einkaufen?  Nein. Ich grabe einen Tunnel unter der Straße und bringe den ganzen Schutt in die Wohnung, damit es keiner merkt.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HeliaTropist @KamalaHarris Persuade people to do what?  To think that free vaccines for everyone are a great idea? I'm right there with you.  To think/believe that the US is going to hand out free vaccines? I will only consider believing that when it happens. Until then, excuse me for being sceptical.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamDoctorOK @MichelDKerrigan @atheist_bad At least you can be funny. 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jlittleboy Dead people don't go anywhere. They are dead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HeliaTropist @KamalaHarris Did you miss the part were I said that it would be great?  I just don't believe in the US doing such a thing. You know, one of the few countries not having "some kind of national HC plan.  Also, according to your comparison, the US is like a country that lives in yurts 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Markus41406755 @tagesschau Weißt du mehr als alle Anderen? Wenn ja, Quelle. Wenn nein, lösch den Tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamalaHarris @HeliaTropist Oh dear...  I see a tweet not aging very well.  Free Healthcare in the US?!  What's next, gun control?  Don't get me wrong, those would be great things, but it's the US...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Tosin Wow...  You really missed the mark here.  Atheism doesn't make a claim of a god not existing. It simply means that your claims of a god are not believed.  Also, faith is useless for anyone who cares about truth. Because ANY position can be held based on faith alone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stq66 @Donauschwalbe @jholofernes @Frauenchemie Ja, gefühlt genau vor 5 Jahren!  Und dann schaut man nach...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackWolfTwo @Renevelation 🤔 Then they must have given me kangaroo or something whenever I thought I had a piece of liver...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Borgziege @KonHaubner @kevin_ketzer @NatalieGrams Öhm... Okay...  Ich denke mir reicht dieser eine hier, ich hab noch nicht mal ansatzweise geschaut ob oder wie man auf twitter einen Zweitaccount gestalten kann.  Gesperrt wurde ich bisher auch nicht. Vielleicht bin ich ja nicht kontrovers genug 🤷‍♂️  Aber was nicht ist... 😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EnormaSass @Kr8cken Oh, very nice question!  Berlioz, Symphony Fantastique Op. 14, 2nd movement  Simply because not many people would know what it is. 😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@faridghalili Sorry. No.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rebekahneeds420 Did you bring drinks or weed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Borgziege @KonHaubner @kevin_ketzer @NatalieGrams Ah, cool. Danke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wellness4You13 @jbadomics 🤷‍♂️ After all those years of hard work? Why would that surprise anyone?  What would surprise me is, if they never managed to get anyone into better positions then, say, the mailman.  Mind you, though, the mailman is not a bad position for a spy. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jbadomics @Wellness4You13 And why would they stop? Did you not hear about Snowden and why he became famous?  Seriously, this game is being played ever since there were people in powerful positions EVERYWHERE.  Why act so surprised?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bee_coast Suddenly everyone is reading?  I finished my "The Origins of You" the other day and am now very busy running through Norway and England, slicing  and hacking whatever or whomever I can. 😁  #ACValhalla<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano Sorry, lost me there.  Playing nice with nazis has been tried and didn't work out so well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yang_WenIi 🤣 Yes, that's true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Tosin And now you're reading my mind?  You have made no point. All you do is claim something, then talk about natural processes and then go: See?  That's rubbish. Present how you know that there is intrinsic meaning.  Repeating your claim does not make it true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Tosin Ad hominem, thereby showing that you realized how your "argument" isn't one. But instead of seeing how your idea wasn't thought through, you just pretend that it's somehow my fault.  Boring.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Tosin Yes, I know what you said. That's how I know that the circle of life isn't the same as intrinsic meaning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KonHaubner @kevin_ketzer @NatalieGrams Siehste, da hätte ich jetzt erstmal nicht so schnell gewusst woher ich die Info bekomme wer denn da von mir geblockt wurde. Denn wenn ich auf solche geblockten Sachen tippe kommt da nur so ein unhilfreicher Infotext von Twitter. Ich schau immer nur welche Namen noch dabei sind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamDoctorOK @MichelDKerrigan @atheist_bad Billions of flies eat shit, they must know something we don't, huh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KonHaubner @kevin_ketzer @NatalieGrams Kann es sein, dass sie den von dir beantworteten Tweet gar nicht sehen kann wenn sie ihn geblockt hat? 😉  https://t.co/62EOhpcKY5<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@stq66 @Donauschwalbe @jholofernes @Frauenchemie Heftig, oder?  Uns ist letztens aufgefallen wann die Matrix in den Kinos war...  Das war bitter.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Palwanda Ha! War gerade mit dem Hund draußen, kein Schnee.  Wir müssen Opfer der selben Verschwörung sein!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Parody, right?  Must be parody. I still hope that there are actual people sitting on the other side of this interweb and sometimes they are being funny.  Right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whomeverett Nope, just playing with the word and it's pronunciation.  We would never be so disrespectful and turn a nice fish into a distraction. That's blasphemy, where I come from.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@naturegirlkenie Not me, no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mithos1987 Schönen Urlaub gewünscht!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whomeverett "to fry" something is "braten". And the herring, well...   Combine these two words, as German famously can, and you get Brathering.  The not at all funny pun is just reading it as if it were an English word.  I'm certain you have heard of brats, the Bratwurst. Fried sausage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whomeverett It's fried herring, actually, and it's an old pun in German.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@manchestermelly No, they really don't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whomeverett Or, here's a nice one: If you ever show up at my place I'm going to give you a Brathering.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whomeverett This one is annoying, yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whomeverett How about sign-if-he-can't?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Tosin What? Are you trying to say that the digestive system is an individuals intrinsic value? 🤣😂  I know you're not, but you ARE trying to sell the idea that nature being interconnected is intrinsic meaning.  That, however, is like saying: Look at the trees!  So what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did you know that this is utter nonsense?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Tosin Actions of individuals have outcomes, that's it.  Also, if you want to claim an individual has intrinsic value, that value would be independent of any of that person's actions.  Or, even if completely without any action, that person would have such intrinsic value.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Tosin Are they? How do you know there is intrinsic meaning in anything?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__Helicon__  https://t.co/cdkEj8aRQH<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NeilLowenthal1 How religions are born...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HeathenSassy Yes, clearly. As it would not eradicate silly beliefs, but it would take away the idea that such beliefs are normal or even respectable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KazePlays_JC Nationalism, religion and, of course, xenophobia.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@logosaetos Most of my friends in school were tom, it was safer and more relaxed that way. And the guys, well, I wasn't into football so 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logosaetos Right? One might think that parents and grandparents support their offspring because they want them to prosper... Who knew? 🤷‍♂️  Nice one, with the paying back. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logosaetos I really hope she can come around to this. It's sad when family isn't that anymore just because of someone's dating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logosaetos Same difference...  🤣😂🤣😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logosaetos I can imagine!  I'm sorry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logosaetos Okay... Interesting. I don't yet know how to place this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logosaetos I never understood why guys find this subject so uncomfortable.  Seriously, what's the problem?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logosaetos 😂🤣😂🤣  My wife still asks me when our wedding anniversary is exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logosaetos This one surprised me a little. Needing a break on a date sounds like an early date, maybe even a first date. Right? And in that setting they join you?! Wow...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logosaetos 🤣😂🤣😂  Don't you leave out any details then!  I'm looking forward to an eye opening wave of information when I wake up.  Good night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Megan6663 @pinata1138 Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sharonafinlay Clothes  As weird as that may be to a native speaker, I just assumed that letters that weren't taught to be silent can be rather quiet.  Yes, I had an English teacher who could have told me otherwise, but she either did not know better or didn't care.  But thanks to Maya, I know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logosaetos Oh? Do tell!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickPonticello All Night - Parov Stelar   https://t.co/rolahGGv43<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParosTom If you find a proper definition for "spiritual" I may be able to answer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rbdwarf Cute little puppy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rbdwarf And then the happy face when they get some crust?  We had pizza today, too...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichL315 None. Whenever I got a new car it was that little bit better than the one before.  So, for now I'd stick with the one I have.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KleineNessa @BoxenIude Moment! Punkt 5...  Böllerverbot ist ja gut und schön und ich bin dafür, aber ich darf nichts trinken?!  https://t.co/f1hjkHV9xC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheFigen Oh sure! She looks amazing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheFigen Make this without an engine but for cycling and you've created a nightmare for motorists.  😂🤣😂🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiamondLynne1 This looks safe...  As long as that middle ladder doesn't slip up it's all good...  Right?  Anyone got a camera?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OllerQuestenman Gelle?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sharonafinlay @logosaetos 🤣😂🤣😂 That had to hurt!  And you didn't even yet fart in her general direction!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ichbinschoener @HerrWM Hm...ich nicht.  Aber meine Vermutung ist auch nicht, dass das gemeint war.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HerrWM @ichbinschoener Inwiefern?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zwillingsmami87 Neid kenn ich nicht, aber ich kann sagen: Sehr schön!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PastorAlexLove But seriously, what is that?  Did a weasel rape a cat or something?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OllerQuestenman Nee... Soll der im Strahl gekommen sein, oder was?  I'm Strahl kotzen kennen wir ja, aber jauchen? Nee...  In welcher "Zeitung" soll das gestanden haben?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logosaetos You're Asian and you became a doctor. Oh, how cliché 🙄  Did I mention that I never understood nor liked the idea of roasting someone?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kapset @AtheistRepublic Speaking the truth has nothing to do with equating incest, adultery or homosexuality.  If you understand the difference of meaning behind those words, then lumping them together is the opposite of speaking the truth, it's lying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kapset @AtheistRepublic "Sex with a partner who is not a spouse" does not contradict the control of human wisdom over one's emotions.  So, no, you either  haven't explained what you mean by "uncontrollable" or you may need to reexamine your initial position.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kapset @AtheistRepublic When you're lumping incest, adultery and homosexuality together like this it looks like your dharma is generalizing quite a bit.  Not a good start.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kapset @AtheistRepublic What do you mean by "uncontrollable"?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doltschevita  https://t.co/YPp2QVoKXc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jwcoppy54 Never.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logosaetos Not a problem from where I sit.  I genuinely like that look.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mork_v I miss traveling abroad.  That would be a nice thing again...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulLaugh44 That's just it. It looks nice in pictures, but in real life it sucks ass.  It's just more white shit falling down on us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rosepet19239091 So far it has only been good.  Never had any trouble.  But, it's a service I don't pay for, so there must be something they make money from.  Consider this before joining.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alfonslopeztena @debbiepalm44 @JRubinBlogger It's cute how they try to distance themselves from the guy they put into office.  No, the GOP should not be let off the hook.  They did this before and now it blew up in their face.  Screw them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiamondLynne1 Usually I intend to just quickly get past them, but once in a while, when they seem like they know what words mean, I let myself get dragged into one of these pointless back-and-forths.  They haven't had any new idea for hundreds of years now... Nothing that even starts interest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Itjustdawndonme @godless_mom Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@debbiepalm44 @UncleRee1 And I am so glad that this someone at least has this choice.  Remember them for who they are in life and for the strength of their decision.  https://t.co/riY3CGxb6S<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@killbyte @godless_mom 😂🤣😂🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UncleRee1 @debbiepalm44 How does this work in his head?  Does he think people just wake up one day, with a tummy ache, and decide they want to die?!  Nobody wants to die, people don't want to suffer! And if your future is suffering until you fucking die, it's not about death, it's about ending pain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@onyxandindigo1 Understandable.  Poor Raven.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rbdwarf I can see why 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zeppelin30188jr Yep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BluesEngine Why? Why am I not surprised?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder Oh, I enjoy seeing mistle in trees!   No particular reason, I just like them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logosaetos A block of rotten milk!  Change my mind?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCReed40 Yes, it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CapturingChrist Because rising from the dead is such an everyday occurrence?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaidenSarah1 Just the other day my mom and I talked about that. Neither of us understand this practice of charging "rent" from your children.  The mere idea is odd to us.  Teaching children to be self-reliant? If they still live with their parents as adults - something went wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@manchestermelly Quick, though.  Imagine that death certificate: axed herself in the head<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jacksoncapper @ElfieGoldbergi1 Talk about 100000 years... Your ancestors are from Africa.  You're the insult to them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alann13345388 Sweet! Congrats!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheFigen 😳 Holy shit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kapset @AtheistRepublic Who says it's uncontrollable?  Being in control does not exclude finding pleasure in sex.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whomeverett Something in the oven?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ichbinschoener Einfach den Leuten einen Zettel an den Kopf nageln, dass sie im Falle einer Infektion nicht behandelt werden wollen...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiamondLynne1 That guy clearly never talked with a theist. Ever!  When you go into the conversation expecting a rational grown up human being, you're in for a treat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zwillingsmami87 Röchtöch!  So sagt doch Jesus in Thessaloniker 7:24: Wer alle Fensterchen an einem Tag öffnet kriegt keine Extrawurst!  Jaja, so ist das.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logosaetos 🤣😂🤣😂🤣  I will SO tell my wife this one!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@godless_mom It's just old and boring.  Faith in what, exactly? And that's when they try telling you that atheism is just another religion blablabla...  It's self destructive, actually. By trying to point at how "atheism doesn't make sense either" they just show how they know THEY are wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mein #Ausblick für heute.  Ja ich weiß, es könnte schlimmer sein...  https://t.co/3Rr1wta2Q7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zwillingsmami87 Jep, ich habe mir auch schon anhören dürfen, dass wir doch keinen Adventskalender haben dürfen.  Aha...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParosTom My what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the funniest shit I have read today!  When this whole #religion gig is over you may consider a career in comedy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pnerd6 @AtheistRepublic Thank you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AtheistRepublic I can't find this tweet. When was he supposed to have sent this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DearMrAtheist Do tell!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mithos1987 @Ninidiil @Kaltmamsell1 @MyMissMM @Don_Marco2 @BlondePusteblum @MuttivsFaschos @DGehirnwurm @KampfzwergJoddy @akiina1987 @DichJasmin Da wurde die Jagswurst aber nicht angebraten... Schade.  Also nur 8/10.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCMhere @rak_strong Agreed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCMhere @rak_strong Thanks.  I was surprised how simple the answer is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logosaetos I'm a switch, generally as well as sexually.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rak_strong Well it's an absolute No on the first.  The second, it's not only my choices that affect the course of my life. And on top of all the choices people make, there are things happening which no-one has control over, say, nature.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mithos1987 Immer gut.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiamondLynne1 😂🤣  Good one, though...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiamondLynne1 😳  Quick, hide the tracks!  Someone might start asking questions!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@authenticsilvr Wer sich mehr um Bildchen kümmert als um Menschenleben, dem ist es doch egal, dass es abartig ist Kinder zu instrumentalisieren.  Ganz im Gegenteil, sie werden darauf beharren, dass es doch gut ist, wenn man Kindern beibringt wer gut oder böse ist. 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shatteroverton @authenticsilvr Na klar, genauso wie es mehrere Götter gibt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Borgziege Na siehste, dann hat er sogar noch Recht dabei...  🤦‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenniLynn2017 @MEarlLou @Rosie_wearamask @natemax @marceelias @GSAEmily Those who are protested against aren't necessarily those who mess up, no.  Fir example, people protesting against masks. Here the protesters are then ones to mess up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Borgziege Na wenn er doch nun so einen Großen hat...  🤣😂🤣😂🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ParosTom Oh dear... Went into the forest - it's full of people!  Sunday, huh? So, Valhalla it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParosTom As today I have a day off, I slept in, am still in bed and the rest of the day I have nothing planned. Maybe strolling through the woods, maybe just playing Valhalla...  Brunch sounds good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AApologetics Wrong question.  The question is what reason might be there to be a theist.  Only to a believer the nonbeliever seems strange.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Palwanda Na denn, alles Gute.  Ich selbst habe 5 Monate vegetarisch gelebt, wegen einer Wette.  Die Wette habe ich natürlich gewonnen, das vegetarische Leben dann aber ebenso natürlich sofort wieder fallen gelassen. 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atheist_bad Just showed this to my wife, who doesn't yet know that already there's another axe on its way here...  She asked: Yes, what do you want to tell me?  I guess I wait until I let her know.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Elishabenabuya @positiefatheism And wouldn't that have been a miracle to behold?!  Imagine how easy it would be to do that nowadays. Just create a brand new human being out of dirt, preferably already at the age of about 30, and have that dude walk around and show us all what's what.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kalanyr @MikeStuchbery_ Paleo Chef... It's another kind of special food hype, right?  Something like only what the stone age people ate?  Somehow the feeling of being special seems to drive those people 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeStuchbery_ What about being a chef is the bit here?  The vegan part at least is a basis for seeing "the others" as evil...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SueBoobinks The Black one, of course.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logosaetos I know what it means, yes. I just don't know if I ever met one.  Sure, with a couple of friends of mine I can assume so, but we never really talked about it, so 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Elishabenabuya Oh... Well, when life gives you lemons, huh?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ThoreRehbach @uwwn19 @martinpallmann @moritz_post Inwiefern?  Er hat ein Jedermannsrecht falsch verstanden. Ja. Und war dann der Meinung: Achso, Presse, na dann dürft ihr.  Eigentlich hat er sich für die Pressefreiheit entschieden - wenn auch unnützerweise.   Die Pressefreiheit ist nun'mal etwas Anderes als ein Jedermannsrecht.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealAnonDouche @Jess_asli I can use my phone with the car too, yes.  But my car's voice is just some female voice explaining stuff, if need be.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ThoreRehbach @uwwn19 @martinpallmann @moritz_post Nämlich, dass die Presse Photos machen darf, Privatpersonen nicht.  Stimmt, damit liegt er falsch.  Nicht aber, weil er die Pressefreiheit nicht verstanden hat, sondern eben das Recht eines Jeden Photos zu machen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThoreRehbach @uwwn19 @martinpallmann @moritz_post Und? Was hat das damit zu tun einem Polizisten zu erklären was Pressefreiheit ist?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jess_asli DeLorean! It's a bloody time machine!  A talking car? Already have that.  And all the others are just cars, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martinpallmann @moritz_post Warum? Da steht doch, dass die Polizei nach Vorzeigen des Presseausweises davon abgelassen hat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaidenSarah1 It's saddening when it's the children who try to build bridges to the parents because it shouldn't be on them to do so.  I learned a long time ago that family is who acts like family, not necessarily who happens to be related to you.  I'm just glad she's not alone in all this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sharonafinlay @AmIMombling 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markoftheD Alright! Congratulations!  Interesting times ahead. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParosTom It's a joke. Friday the 13th and that in 2020!  Imagine, with all the crap happening this year, this Friday was really calm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KlatuBaradaNiko That's like 6 metres, innit?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@VamboRools @CarrotteG Nowadays I can only hope so. I'm sorry to say that I do not think anymore that this is improbable.  After all, it's the US.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiamondLynne1 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irSkullBeard @CatSoluna Not quite. I made a point of teaching my child to remember the life of those lost. The achievements and good times shared.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarrotteG @VamboRools No. Please, no.  Tell me this is satire.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TDen2020 Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrueFactsStated @wvd11_moo But who would want to take this moron in?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fToRrEeEsSt @NurseSheepie Oh crap! Who are you? And get out of my head!  Instant follow!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NurseSheepie Well, banks, churches and the military-industrial complex.  Oh, you said wrong answers only... Sorry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Morgalisa I'm glad we agree there 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PastorAlexLove Oh, I am so sorry!  SHE is making a good point, of course.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Morgalisa Only question, though.  Why are EMT not considered health care workers?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KonHaubner Na warten wir mal ab...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PastorAlexLove 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂  I believe he's making a statement about the state of the world these days. And he's right, of course.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder I shall set my alarm and definitely send you a tweet!  Don't worry, I won't have to wake up, as I shall be at work. 😉<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sharonafinlay @AmIMombling This. I would miss all my other books, but this would be it.  Instead of the two books I didn't bring, I'd bring my pot. Trust me, you'll want me to.  https://t.co/0AKYT7OBSo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder Magic, I tell you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sharonafinlay I'm glad that cleared up.  But how!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@namaferd If it didn't come across that way, the middle part was sarcastic.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MARKJDANIELS @kevin_ketzer @Gerecht_Suender He'll only burn me forever if I don't take it.  How do you not understand this?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CynicalMinion @RCMhere 🤣😂🤣😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCMhere @CynicalMinion To be fair, the same applies to advertising.  If you believe what advertising tells you, then you're a gullible fool who almost deserves to be taken advantage of.  Truth in advertising:  "Diamonds, render her speechless." "Diamonds, that'll shut her up" Ron White<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MARKJDANIELS @kevin_ketzer @Gerecht_Suender That is exactly what threatening damnation is.  "refusing the loving hand" is punished by eternal damnation.  "Love me, or I fucking burn you forever, because I love you."  To not think that this is a threat is, to say the least, twisted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hanjiluvrs  https://t.co/UeoNtZ73xz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCMhere @CynicalMinion Are we now drifting off into talking about religion again? 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whomeverett Hey, don't worry about it too much. We just opened an airport that should never even have been built. 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whomeverett Woo-hoo! First class engineering, huh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCMhere @CynicalMinion Depends on what has been said specifically. 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LetruneInedil It definitely is the exploration.  This is why I got so hooked on almost all the #FarCry and almost all the #AssassinsCreed  Right now, with #AssassinsCreedValhalla I am kinda enjoying the idea of setting up a settlement in England, but so far I'm not too impressed by it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PastorAlexLove Yes. Yes it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCMhere @Soronsen Facts decide what's true.  And as much as winners WRITE history, they still can't create it.  I guess he's taking 1984 too literally (as the whole Trump administration does)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCMhere Hm... Interesting question...  One thing that comes to mind is the idea that a lie about a particular person can be seen as a direct attack on that person's honour or reputation.  Telling masses a lie about, say, democrats wanting socialism, is aimed at an organization...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KonHaubner @FriendlyGrond Well, yes, Elijah Wood was 20 in 2001, not at all a child, sure. And yes, I just looked that up 😁  Anyway, I guess we can agree, if you talked to people who had only seen the movies and asked them  to guess Frodo's age none would have been even close to 50.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logosaetos In time...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PaulLaugh44 That is one happy beaver!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gerecht_Suender @Io_No_ Und wen kümmert es ob es eine Schriftensammlung ist oder nicht?  Damit ist die Frage nach deren Wahrheitsgehalt nicht beantwortet.  Grimms Märchen sind auch eine Sammlung. 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Io_No_ @Gerecht_Suender Bisher habe ich noch keine Antwort darauf bekommen. Dafür wurde die letzte Stunde darauf verwandt über diese oder jene Bibelstelle zu reden.  Als hätte die Bibel irgendeine Bedeutung...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michawitcz @kevin_ketzer @Gerecht_Suender Ist sie doch genauso hilflos wie alle Religionen...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gerecht_Suender Behaupten kann man Vieles, aber ob es stimmt...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gerecht_Suender Ob es Hardliner gibt die sagen, dass das keine wahren Juden sind ist doch egal. Man kann konvertieren. Es gibt auch Christen die anderen Christen absprechen wahre Christen zu sein. 🤷‍♂️  Das behauptet deine Religion, aber ob es stimmt ist die Frage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gerecht_Suender @kevin_ketzer Du versuchst gerade die Richtigkeit der Bibel mit dem zu beweisen was die Bibel sagt.  Das ist in Sachen Logik komplett daneben und obendrein, wenn wir das gelten lassen wollen, gilt es für alle anderen heiligen Bücher genauso.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gerecht_Suender @Io_No_ Wie auch andere Religionen das Christentum als abgöttisch verordnen.  Also, unzureichend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gerecht_Suender um Anderen etwas zu vergeben, was er selbst geschaffen hat?  Wo ist da die Logik?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gerecht_Suender Ne Menge Behauptungen... Jünger oder älter - keine Basis für R/F. Menge von Gläubigen - keine Basis für R/F. Ethnie? Völlig falsch. Man kann zum Judentum konvertieren. Religionen, die Andere negieren - genau darum geht es doch gerade. Logik? Ein Gott der sich sich selbst opfert<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sart26409389 @RoMaPhotobug Okay... Hm, I don't drive auto nearly often enough to have realized that.  If I do, it's because at work all the sticks have been taken (almost never) and then it seems fine. It a VW Transporter 6 (T6, shortly) I don't remember it doing that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Gerecht_Suender Sagen alle Gläubigen über ihre Götter. Reicht so also nicht.  Aber, da ich kein Spielverderber bin:  Wenn du mir einen Weg zeigen kannst über welchen ich herausfinden kann welcher von all diesen Göttern wahr ist, dann können wir drüber reden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tele_chinese @onyx0815 Muss!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@onyx0815 Warum?!  Klingt ein bisschen wie: habe mir probeweise ein Messer in den Fuß gesteckt - läuft nicht so gut.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tele_chinese @onyx0815 Röchtöch!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gerecht_Suender Aber? Dann ist dir aufgefallen, dass wenn man selbst noch an den Weihnachtsmann glaubt, man nicht über den Osterhasen lachen kann ohne sich selbst lächerlich zu machen?  Nein, ich weiß, das wäre zu viel Denken. Lieber zurückfallen in: "Andere Götter sind Unsinn, meiner nicht."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarrollMack82 Which is EXACTLY why she should have been running for president and he could have been vice again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZDFheute Warum ist dieses Land in der #EU?  Ach ja, die Wirtschaft... Ich war mal wieder kurz in dem Gedanken versunken, dass die EU eine Wertegemeinschaft sei.  Es gibt Momente, da könnte man den Brexit fast verstehen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gerecht_Suender Warum? Manitu hat doch nichts gegen Homosexuelle oder Transgender.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@semperdiced Sorry, but when have "the men and women in uniform" ever not been used as political pawns?  When was the thanks for service ever more than lip service?  The military is a tool. Always has been.  The stories of honour and glory have always only served to keep up morale.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoMaPhotobug I'm European, stick is normal.  In Germany it says in one's license that one is allowed only to operate vehicles with automatic shift if you learned to drive in one of them. And rightly so, imnsho.  Sticklers (pun intended) are allowed to drive either.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EbonySkeptic And why do these boards have anything to do with anything? 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atheist_bad What a bunch of idiotic kindergarten kids. 🤦‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotLordByron I feel you.  I hope it's still warm though. THAT would be a change!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaneDoelish Isn't it? Isn't the believer part of the problem? This war machine couldn't run without those who are blinded by these shiny lies, just like the glorification of the military, and the nationalism that is squeezed into every little thing in the US.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder Sounds good so far.  Everything is going to be just fine.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LePeas69 @pinkheretic A truth that isn't scientifically verifiable. Interesting idea...  Can you name one?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@godless_mom My favourite picture this week was an old one. We shared it again amongst ourselves as we said goodbye to the airport #TXL while we had to take our places in the "new" airport.

<|startoftext|>@Io_No_ @valabg An sich richtig - einem Berufstheologen ist das allerdings völlig egal - Hauptsache die Kohle stimmt.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mork_v Aren't those the nights you remember?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@valabg Hobbytheologen sind leider nur arme Opfer.  Berufstheologen hingegen nutzen die Leichtgläubigen aus und sind in meinem Buch daher eine Stufe schlimmer. Ja, ich bin mir bewusst damit zu implizieren, dass B. den Unsinn selbst gar nicht glauben.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PherenikeK @NatalieGrams Nein, das war nicht deine Frage.  Und da ich auf Taubenschach gerade keinen Bock habe:  Tschüss.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PherenikeK @NatalieGrams Okay, du kannst offenbar nicht bei einem Thema bleiben.  Oder werden Beschneidungen bei Phimosen aus Glaubensgründen vorgenommen?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PherenikeK @NatalieGrams 2. Frage zuerst. Das hättest du gerne, dass ich der Böse bin, der sagt Menschen seien nicht normal. Glaube und Mensch sind nicht dasselbe.  Zu 1. Leider eben nicht. Beispiel? Beschneidungen sind in unserer Gesellschaft "normal".  Wie kann sowas normal sein?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PherenikeK @NatalieGrams Wissenschaftliche Fakten und Daten falsch zu verstehen ist noch nicht einmal ansatzweise in der selben Richtung wie etwas zu glauben wofür es keinerlei Grundlage gibt.  Das Eine kann jedem passieren und kann durch Hinterfragen berichtigt werden, das Andere ist nur tragisch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PherenikeK @NatalieGrams Wer redet von Extremisten?  Das Thema ist Glaube.  Nein, Glaube sollte eben nicht normal sein.  Warum in aller Welt sollte es normal sein, dass jemand glaubt 2+2 sei 5 und darauf basierend Entscheidungen trifft?  Entscheidungen in der realen Welt, mit realen Folgen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ApostateProphet @ArminNavabi  https://t.co/6YG8Ggj41e<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnthroBlogger Wo sind die Wasserwerfer?  Ach ja, Leipzig... Warum frag ich überhaupt?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PherenikeK @NatalieGrams Kurz gehaltene Antwort: Es normalisiert Glaube. Und solange Glaube in einer Gesellschaft als normal angesehen wird, werden die, die in ihres Glaubens Namen Schaden verursachen ebenso normalisiert.  Glaube schadet, wenn er entgegen Wissen und Vernunft zur Tugend ernannt wird.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NatalieGrams Ich empfinde es, wie bei allen Menschen die von Gott faseln, als eine Beleidigung ihrer eigenen Person.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PermissiontoQ I'm not worried then. And you may talk dirty to me as much as you want.  Oh, is different from talk shit about me? What I know, I no native speak English. 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@logosaetos 😂🤣😂🤣  It's true, though.  Just think how photos on ID rarely look like you. And now, how it may look to someone who hasn't ever seen you before and probably never will again while, at the same time, they look at thousands of ID photos every day.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@w_nicht For a while now that is so, yes.  The last few days have been filled with shrooms since I took my wife into the woods and she is now totally into it.

<|startoftext|>@PhadingDark That I'd need a lawyer I can easily follow, even agree to a certain extent.  But refusing a medical procedure that would save a child's life is abuse at least!

<|startoftext|>@idrisyounis @AaishaArshi What's so hard to understand?  Parents don't teach their children that tattooing their faces is "good".  A woman decides whether or not she wants to be pregnant.  These are choices.  If you like hijab so much, you wear it. 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thegoodgodabove Illegally.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Chris_SmithsJ @JosephNollaSJ the only logical answer that we have to find an answer before we go on.  Jumping to a god conclusion is in this case the good old "I-don't-know-therefore-god", the god of the gaps. 2/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chris_SmithsJ @JosephNollaSJ Yes, this would be the moment when we start to talk about the premises in the argument, not the lack of logic in the argument itself.  Sadly, in all versions of the cosmological argument the premises, if answered honestly, can only be answered with: I don't know.  Leading to 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BadBradRSR Carlin, anytime.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mork_v Law Abiding Cirizen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JosephNollaSJ Finding infinite regress absurd doesn't make it true or false. That's why we said that we don't know.  Jumping to a conclusion does not qualify as a logical conclusion.  And that there must be a cause without a cause, without explaining why, is special pleading.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JosephNollaSJ like the idea of infinite regress. 2/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JosephNollaSJ Right. And thus, going back to the claim everything that begins has to have a cause, so there has to be an uncaused cause. Which 1. as you said is a contradiction as 2. we agreed we don't know. Thus, it's an exception without merit - a special pleading.  Just because we don't 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jothaka Aba lustisch! 😂🤣😂🤣  Schön gestellt, aber lustig.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParosTom I'm at work, for example.  But just another hour and a half!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JosephNollaSJ Many finding it absurd is true, that doesn't make the claim true or false, though.  Our problem is that we have no other examples but the world around us to make any such claim.  Us not knowing the answer does not lead to a logical conclusion.  Honesty would demand we say: Dunno.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DocAtCDI This made me interrupt my colleagues' lunch by bursting out laughing!   Luckily her English is good enough to understand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JosephNollaSJ It's the same thing.  It just adds the "beginning" vs "eternal" and goes on to make one thing eternal (special pleading) and the rest had a beginning.   One could also word it as: Nothing exists without a cause, but there has to be that one thing that didn't have a cause.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BesapLilly @iam_ThePaulo Because the stories are made up by boring minds, rather than interesting exciting ones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JosephNollaSJ Sure. All these versions of the same argument state that nothing can be "X" and end in therefore something has to be "X".  If an exception is made that one thing can be "X", without showing that this can not be applied to other things - that is special pleading.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Clauduella_ella Aber leider nicht mehr überraschend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JosephNollaSJ Just to clarify. You're saying that the premises may be at fault but the logic is sound?  As "contingency" is just another version of the cosmological argument it isn't logical at all, no matter what premises one uses, because it ultimately ends in special pleading.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rbdwarf That's annoying. I feel you.  We had to do this in March.  But there's a silver lining: in general one doesn't do that too often, so when you're done you can look forward to a long time of not moving.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Synsei1 @Renevelation @davestewart4444 This is the only point I would concede here.  Generally people do not take/have the time to assess the legal subtleties of situations like this. That is why there is a legal process afterwards. While hindsight is 20/20 this means that a good lawyer is aware of legal options.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Minuteman04 It's not a matter of belief.  He went into the bedroom with her.  Done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davestewart4444 @Renevelation I guess.  I'd consider it Kindergarten.  But in times of corona being spat on, risking my whole family's lives, a little more could be merited.  https://t.co/ScwVZHTFMD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davestewart4444 @Renevelation Yes.  Because spitting back wouldn't be useful to stop her from spitting further.  Pushing her away clearly is the better option.  Well... 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davestewart4444 @Renevelation Which is why it's still covered under sepf defense.  I don't know, though, how the law handles that in the US. But considering that the US sanctions shooting people for just being on your property, I think I can assume that it's easily covered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davestewart4444 @Renevelation Got it.  Yes, retaliation offers a feeling of justice being done. And it's a way to make sure that the perp might consider doing any such thing again. The problem, of course, is that this may lead to the "eye for an eye" kind of "justice".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarieAllOverAg1 Gray broccoli.  That's hot!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davestewart4444 @Renevelation That instance is self-defense, yes. You throw a punch and walk away and then catch a punch while moving away is excess of self-defense.  In German law, at least, this still is covered, as after being attacked you are emotionally driven. But that too has its limits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davestewart4444 @Renevelation Are we talking legally or emotionally?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaeDaeSupreme Shit! Man, it seemed so cool.  I hope you're okay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Renevelation I would consider this to be excess of self-defense.  As spitting at someone isn't just an attack on someone's honour, it also is a physical assault, certainly so in the context of disease/mask-no-mask.  I do agree, though, that this isn't funny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davestewart4444 @Renevelation Retaliation is not a part of self-defense.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PastorAlexLove I'm loving it!  How it tells all of us to stop giving a fuck and just enjoy life - until Christmas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_lemontarte @heimsittich Okay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCReed40 🤣😂🤣😂🤣  I get you!  But her though... If she ever got tired of him I'd surely offer her a place where she can rest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_lemontarte @heimsittich Und genau da liegt deren Problem.  Eigentlich wissen sie, dass es reiner Unsinn ist. Aber Mami und Papi haben doch immer gesagt, dass es stimmt.  https://t.co/b49zxhSagt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_lemontarte @heimsittich Doch doch, sie lassen solche Typen dumm aussehen. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DocAtCDI My axe and a good knife.  Whatever awaits me on the other side, these will be useful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@7EyedGoddess Well then, let's go with: it came on it's own, it'll leave on it's own.  I'm crossing my fingers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrishGlenn @bikinatroll @NatureUK Wow...  Are there smurfs nearby? Someone has to be maintaining it, surely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atheist_bad My immediate question would be: if he's so important in anything else, why was he not involved in the getting married part?  Why that weird specific exclusion?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@7EyedGoddess Heh, concern doesn't cost me a thing and at least shows you that you're not alone.  Working through is okay and respectable, just, if it doesn't get better have someone check it out.  Says a guy who only goes to see a doctor when he's holding his head in his hands 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dimamynedd Europa.  It's the one I would bet on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@galadriele24 But, you don't have to comment.  Just don't write anything and press retweet instead 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@St_Manches  https://t.co/naljpHIyi9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder Sounds good.  You do that. Batten down the hatches and don't forget to bring some toffifee or whatever you like.  We're here if you need to vent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder Oh...  That shared workplace does make it difficult, I can see that.  They say it helps to imagine the people you're confronted with as naked, but I'm not sure if that helps you in this case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@7EyedGoddess Sounds like this isn't just a case of the wrong exercise yesterday...  imnsho - leave the schoolwork, take care of yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@7EyedGoddess Damn...  Can you do that school work in bed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DocAtCDI That would be my wife.  But, thanks to humanity being what it is, she slowly develops nihilistic opinions and I am NOT the right person to try and persuade her otherwise as I already think humanity is fucked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SueBoobinks Si. Esatto!  😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder Oh dear...  Are you sure she wouldn't understand?  And yes, I'm guessing the thought of explaining it to your mum doesn't really help against the anxiety.  Most importantly, I think, before getting into any situation that puts you under pressure, rest and gather yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logosaetos Ah, Lapu-lapu!  Okay... Interesting story.  Sadly Christianity still found its way onto the island.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Muhammadfarh_an @disclosetv Because we can!  And because that "person" you love so much is a horrible character.  Any other questions?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is beautiful!  My respect to whoever decided and allowed this!  This is in fact what EVERY newspaper and public institution should have done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logosaetos Thorin Oakenshield<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logosaetos I don't think it will change much.  It'll just serve as a talking point about how nice and forgiving he is and what a great reformer while his cardinals and bishops already declared, that this does not impact the church doctrine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArminNavabi @aliamjadrizvi My initial reaction was to protest, but having read the point that religion is just as well covered under freedom of expression and freedom of speech...  I am inclined to give it go. Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aelurotheist @marczimmermann Richtig.  Und ich kann gar nicht so viel fressen wie ich kotzen möchte.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marczimmermann @aelurotheist Yep, die gleichen Leute die ohnehin so tun als sei jetzt ein ganz ein lieber Typ Papst geworden...  Nee, der Heuchler und sein ganzer Verein hat nur ein Ziel: Menschen zu unterdrücken.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aelurotheist @marczimmermann Ach das Ding. Also ist nichts passiert.  Er unterstützt staatliche Ehen von gleichgeschlechtlichen Paaren. Etwas, wo er eh nix zu melden hat, dieser alte Heuchler.   Hui, danke.  In der katholischen Kirche ändert sich dadurch nichts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AHumannature Indoctrination and gullibility for the first part. Lack of evidence for the second.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heimsittich Let me assure you - there are quite a number of lefties who understand the difference between religion and ethnicity.  Oddly, the are the ones who are considered radical. 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marczimmermann Ist etwas passiert?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#JamesRandi died.  He was one of the greatest people ever. A brilliant and funny mind.  There are few people I would miss, he's one.  .  .  .  Fuck 2020.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CommonCormorant What do you mean? Retweet works fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nyccookies It's not huge at all. Nothing changes.  He talked about civil unions. Meaning legal unions, not weddings in catholic churches.  In short, he says that sovereign states can allow same-sex unions. Which is none of his business anyway!  Why thank you! What a great guy... 🤮<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Serious question to #ProLife and #Prochoice alike.  Knowing what we do about #child #development.  Do you think there should be a legally guaranteed paid #parental #leave for the first year or two years of the child's life?  Please RT for range.  You may comment, of course.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logosaetos You're right, it does look like a painting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maxbrooksauthor @MelBrooks Woah, @MelBrooks I see you've been tagged in this already...  Well, at least you'll know when your son doesn't tell you what I asked him to.  Thank you, again, for being a wonderful memory from my teenage years.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@webheaven22 @sanjaymehta @mathewskluke @101avenger @Patrioticsoul3 @JerryAbsolute @Khushal30459869 @ArminNavabi @AtheistRepublic Utter nonsense. Once an idea is out there it does not depend on one person to be valid or not. It depends on its veracity or its value if it kept by people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@webheaven22 @sanjaymehta @mathewskluke @101avenger @Patrioticsoul3 @JerryAbsolute @Khushal30459869 @ArminNavabi @AtheistRepublic Nonsense. Belief doesn't mean it's true.  Only evidence and facts can point towards truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@webheaven22 @Patrioticsoul3 @sanjaymehta @mathewskluke @101avenger @JerryAbsolute @Khushal30459869 @ArminNavabi @AtheistRepublic Ever heard of Troy?  So what?  If there is no way to verify something - whyever would you believe it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@webheaven22 @sanjaymehta @mathewskluke @101avenger @Patrioticsoul3 @JerryAbsolute @Khushal30459869 @ArminNavabi @AtheistRepublic You are conflating a character with an ideal.  Ask yourself: Are ideals or ideologies individual or do they depend on someone special holding the ideals?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@webheaven22 @sanjaymehta @mathewskluke @101avenger @Patrioticsoul3 @JerryAbsolute @Khushal30459869 @ArminNavabi @AtheistRepublic Again, you're late - the "personal experience" as a reason to believe something doesn't account for the fact that a person can be wrong about something. As such it then doesn't present a good reason to believe anything, let alone make life choices based on that belief.  So: No.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@webheaven22 @Patrioticsoul3 @sanjaymehta @mathewskluke @101avenger @JerryAbsolute @Khushal30459869 @ArminNavabi @AtheistRepublic What facts?  It's a fictional character! There are no facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NbGeek2 @StdSucks They think they play a role in Star Trek.  😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@webheaven22 @sanjaymehta @mathewskluke @101avenger @Patrioticsoul3 @JerryAbsolute @Khushal30459869 @ArminNavabi @AtheistRepublic Facts and proofs?  Dude, it's about a goddess. A most ridiculous notion to start with. Facts and proofs obviously are not what believers care about.  Also, ideals and qualities exist without any deity and are therefore separate from it - thus they are not the target.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@webheaven22 @sanjaymehta @mathewskluke @101avenger @Patrioticsoul3 @JerryAbsolute @Khushal30459869 @ArminNavabi @AtheistRepublic If they are mere symbols, why get so upset?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@webheaven22 @Patrioticsoul3 @sanjaymehta @mathewskluke @101avenger @JerryAbsolute @Khushal30459869 @ArminNavabi @AtheistRepublic You really are late. All these have been mentioned before.  Yes, religions are fairytales that just are believed to be true by gullible people.  Which is why we find believers so ridiculous.  The only sad part is, that most religious people have been indoctrinated as children.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atheist_bad  https://t.co/NI8mwelAQ3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaeDaeSupreme 🤣😂🤣😂 I can see how that happens!  Thanks for the warning. I shall not re-watch it, just so I can keep it in good memory.  I quit watching after the 7th, for the same reason you had.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Tuxiterano Die Zen-Schranke am Ende!  😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atheist_bad I assume you know why, so:  Because Schadenfreude.  They love to watch people with their kids and give them idiotic advice on how to raise their children.  Just for shits and giggles.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ennolenze Nö. Alles noch genau so.  Aber das Heulen ist doch spannender als einfach nur sein Leben zu leben.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AntitheistCrsd No way. They won't be normal for a long, long time.  Also, I'm sure that Biden won't make much of a difference, even if he wants to.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@webheaven22 @sanjaymehta @mathewskluke @101avenger @Patrioticsoul3 @JerryAbsolute @Khushal30459869 @ArminNavabi @AtheistRepublic BTW if you attach yourself to fictional characters that much, you should reconsider calling other mentally sick. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@webheaven22 @sanjaymehta @mathewskluke @101avenger @Patrioticsoul3 @JerryAbsolute @Khushal30459869 @ArminNavabi @AtheistRepublic I do understand the emotion.  That's the whole point!  Your emotions are irrelevant to other people's right to draw a picture of an imaginary character or even their right to mock said characters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@webheaven22 @sanjaymehta @mathewskluke @101avenger @Patrioticsoul3 @JerryAbsolute @Khushal30459869 @ArminNavabi @AtheistRepublic I liked Sherlock Homes.  Now, do you think that I'd be upset if you drew some pictures of him?  Of course not. It doesn't change the reasons I liked the story.  Not for a second, though, would I suggest him to be anyone's father. 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Patrioticsoul3 @webheaven22 @sanjaymehta @mathewskluke @101avenger @JerryAbsolute @Khushal30459869 @ArminNavabi @AtheistRepublic Stop bugging you?!   You literally came into a thread that followed a tweet of mine.  You came to me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@webheaven22 @Patrioticsoul3 @sanjaymehta @mathewskluke @101avenger @JerryAbsolute @Khushal30459869 @ArminNavabi @AtheistRepublic Of course it does. The only rule that says I can't is a religious one and since I don't follow that religion, as you said, I am free not to follow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Snoozedanger Kiffen bis wir so aufgeputscht sind, dass wir wild schreiend durch die Einkaufsstraße rennen. Nackt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Patrioticsoul3 @webheaven22 @sanjaymehta @mathewskluke @101avenger @JerryAbsolute @Khushal30459869 @ArminNavabi @AtheistRepublic We can easily talk about people who can "misuse" religion.  Would you like to start by talking about how some religious want to tell non-religious what to do and what not to do?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@das_kaushik @AprlShwrMayFlwr @50cent Likewise!  And don't worry, if I didn't live in Germany I wouldn't use German at all, either.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ParosTom Disagree.  All it takes is being biased. Intelligence then only enables one to comes up with more elaborate excuses as to why one believes something without having a reason for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairlessChimp @toferj_ Since I had to fix up a house over the last half year I started to detest the star headed screws. Getting worn out pretty much immediately.  Talking about the lower of the designs you highlighted.   The crossed screws served best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PageSix Well boohoo...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder Oh dear...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder Did someone have some millions of bucks that needed to be moved to Europe?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCReed40 Oh, 1996!?  Yeah no surprise I don't know that one - at that time I was in the service. 🤷‍♂️  Well, maybe I can catch up later...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCReed40 Looks cute.  What is this?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@heimsittich Yeah, adolescents...  Slowly becoming adult but not yet being allowed all the things adults are allowed. I can imagine that to be frustrating.  So, who's the bad guys? The adults. 🤷‍♂️  And who's the easiest target? Those who are perceived as the weakest - the elderly.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Exactly.  This is #truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Renevelation He still hasn't blocked you?  Wow... It's so peaceful without seeing him repeat the same nonsense over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been picking some mushrooms for lunch and went for the prettiest ones. You know, as in relationships, pretty means it must be good...  Is it normal to see blue elephants with frog legs flying through the house?  https://t.co/G2Oijasbbz<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheFigen When he wakes up: 1st: make sure they got that on tape. 2nd: cheapest divorce ever!  But, since he doesn't seem like a guy who stands up for himself it's more likely that he'll go to her and even apologize for whatever he guesses she thinks he did wrong.  Sad story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrunTheBear If I were a US citizen who could vote there, my only reason to vote for Biden would be to counter Trump.  Because Biden is just another bland old white guy.

<|startoftext|>@NokooTV @DaeDaeSupreme @InspiringChris1 Same old BS.  The cosmological argument isn't an argument for a god at all.  Well, the "god of the gaps", yes.  And this is "the best case"?  Ridiculous.  #religion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCReed40 Heh, at least potatoes are American 😉<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mathewskluke @Patrioticsoul3 @sanjaymehta @101avenger @JerryAbsolute @Khushal30459869 @ArminNavabi @AtheistRepublic All good.  What would we be if we couldn't talk rationally?  We'd be religious 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mathewskluke @Patrioticsoul3 @sanjaymehta @101avenger @JerryAbsolute @Khushal30459869 @ArminNavabi @AtheistRepublic Right. I agreed with all but the last point.  Saying that incarceration is preferable because it's worse than death is appealing only to emotions. Specifically the want to carry out revenge.  Appealing to emotions is what religion does - hence the religious' overboard reactions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mathewskluke @Patrioticsoul3 @sanjaymehta @101avenger @JerryAbsolute @Khushal30459869 @ArminNavabi @AtheistRepublic Except for the death/prison part - there I have very strong opinions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Patrioticsoul3 @sanjaymehta @mathewskluke @101avenger @JerryAbsolute @Khushal30459869 @ArminNavabi @AtheistRepublic All that "talking nice" (well, mostly).  And then you finish off on "avatar is a scientific concept" 🤣😂  Nobody attacked you. Sorry, but you being upset about a drawing is all on you. 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@atheist_bad  https://t.co/55jMxyCYt1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@solsukut It's not that people don't understand the CA. It's simply that it isn't a logical argument at all.  The ball, for example, might just as well have been moved by a gust of wind. 🤷‍♂️  Regurgitaters of the CA do not eliminate any other options, they just jump to a conclusion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Patrioticsoul3 @sanjaymehta @mathewskluke @101avenger @JerryAbsolute @Khushal30459869 @ArminNavabi @AtheistRepublic Still upset over a drawing I see...  Well, that's on you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HeathenOpinions It's a tough but very freeing decision.  My congratulations!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nkostelic Me! My hair is easily maintained.  Whixh is why I have it the way I do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InspiringChris1 If they don't contradict each other and are evidence-based, sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarkCloset911 Here is an article someone already posted under the original tweet.    https://t.co/jo8TCDctm1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaidenSarah1 I'm sure you'll make the best of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarkCloset911 And then you hear about what they did with the guy who discovered that it was toilet water...  All #religion is dangerous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zwillingsmami87 Oh, sowas hab ich schon'mal gesehen!  Ich dachte das wären solche blöden Entspannungsbälle sind, oder Liebeskugeln für SEHR entspannte Leute...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mork_v I have, for 13 years. Then, at some night shoot of some commercial, I had a quick break and there was only 1 cig left in the box.  I decided that this is my last one.  That was 14 years ago... Yes, I never went back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zwillingsmami87 Was sind Trocknerbälle?  Und was machen Kinder damit? Essen die sowas?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Na wenn es bisher noch keine Einladung an #Hausbesetzer gab, dieser Artikel ist doch jetzt eine, oder?   https://t.co/KNqclhzb89<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KonHaubner Sehr viele Sachen die du da erwähnt hast waren mir gar nicht bekannt. Den zuzufügen wüsste ich nur, dass Cleopatra recht schön gewesen sein soll. Und da ist Gal Gadot ja wohl perfekt!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sanjaymehta @mathewskluke @101avenger @Patrioticsoul3 @JerryAbsolute @Khushal30459869 @ArminNavabi @AtheistRepublic Tell me what that has to do with #SexyKali and I might consider your request.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mathewskluke @sanjaymehta @101avenger @Patrioticsoul3 @JerryAbsolute @Khushal30459869 @ArminNavabi @AtheistRepublic The whataboutism is strong in this one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Patrioticsoul3 @mathewskluke @101avenger @JerryAbsolute @Khushal30459869 @ArminNavabi @AtheistRepublic Who introduded in your right to practice your religion?  When did someone else drawing some picture stop you from doing whatever you do?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eweigel112 @trbln Wrong. Belief is, to accept a given claim as true.  It is by no means an answer to the question if that claim is true or false.  It is at best the answer that one beliefs it even before the question has been answered.  And it's an unsound answer at that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JerryAbsolute @dan_hazrat @Patrioticsoul3 @Khushal30459869 @mathewskluke @ArminNavabi @AtheistRepublic True.  Aesop's fables.  Stories told in order to convey morals - nobody needs to believe they really happened.  But teaching people takes more time and effort than indoctrination them. Hence religion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaidenSarah1 Pictures?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Clauduella_ella Leider ja, ich wundere mich auch immer wieder wo diese ehemaligen Freunde falsch abgebogen sind.  Und dann kommt der Moment wo ich höre, dass sie sich das Gleiche fragen!  Ist schon traurig. Aber was soll man machen 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SilvaAtTwitta @NoahRettberg Als Raucher waren mir die Bildchen völlig egal. Es ist ja nicht, als wüsste man nicht, dass Rauchen ungesund ist. 🤷‍♂️  Inzwischen, als Nichtraucher, sind mir die Bildchen immer noch egal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Clauduella_ella Ein Covidiot könnte also daraus lesen: "Siehste, nur weil sie dem Staat vertrauen!"   Das tue ich zum Beispiel gar nicht. 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Clauduella_ella Ich finde einerseits zu höflich die #Coronaleugner "misstrauisch" zu nennen. Außerdem, diese behaupten doch, dass die, die Masken tragen nur der Regierung glauben (in Staat und Behörden vertrauen).  Ist etwa der Grund eine Maske zu tragen für dich, dass der Staat es dir sagt?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@101avenger @Patrioticsoul3 @JerryAbsolute @Khushal30459869 @mathewskluke @ArminNavabi @AtheistRepublic "Legal" only means with the consent and/or support of any given government.  "Legal" doesn't mean "right".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DocAtCDI Summer.  I never understood people who talk about autumn or spring because of the colours.  Summer is colourful, just without the annoying unpredictable weather.  And winter, yeah, fuck winter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@101avenger @Patrioticsoul3 @JerryAbsolute @Khushal30459869 @mathewskluke @ArminNavabi @AtheistRepublic You do what you do, of course.  It's what makes everyone see that the problem isn't Islam exclusively but religion coupled with nationalism - as usual.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@manas1323 @mathewskluke @JerryAbsolute @Khushal30459869 @ArminNavabi @AtheistRepublic You didn't really read what he wrote, right.  Let me guess, you stopped reading after shit head?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Khushal30459869 @101avenger @Patrioticsoul3 @JerryAbsolute @mathewskluke @ArminNavabi @AtheistRepublic Nothing. It doesn't need to have a personal connection to me in order to be an example of what has been asked for.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Khushal30459869 @mathewskluke @Patrioticsoul3 @JerryAbsolute @ArminNavabi @AtheistRepublic No, eastern guy, you seem to just have swapped one drug for another, though.  What exactly do you think is an atheist? Or, what do you think you were when you said you were an atheist?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CapturingChrist True. Are you ready to talk about bias then?  About why one would believe something without evidence for it, just because it's the position that reinforces their feelings on how something should be?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KathrynMeissne1 Meine Glückwünsche!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder That sucks. I hope you're better now.  Since I have a day off today, I guess we don't need to talk about mine.  I wish you a better day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@101avenger @Patrioticsoul3 @JerryAbsolute @Khushal30459869 @mathewskluke @ArminNavabi @AtheistRepublic No, #charliehebdo is not forgotten. It is an obvious fact that shows how dangerous #religion is.  And it's one of the reasons people speak up, because religions have nothing to offer but threats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Khushal30459869 @mathewskluke @Patrioticsoul3 @JerryAbsolute @ArminNavabi @AtheistRepublic Of course you are. You were born.  But then someone convinced you of some baseless bullshit and you believed it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Khushal30459869 @mathewskluke @Patrioticsoul3 @JerryAbsolute @ArminNavabi @AtheistRepublic Atheism is not something to practice.  No one was trying to stop you from being Hindu.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@utopianas @SANDEEP53407875 @ArminNavabi @AtheistRepublic Why would I try to be Hindu?  Is there any reason to want that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@utopianas @Patrioticsoul3 @JerryAbsolute @Khushal30459869 @mathewskluke @ArminNavabi @AtheistRepublic How desperate are you?  Quoting your own tweet as "true"...  All you said was "you just don't believe because you lack the ability"  That's a line used by believers of any other religion out there.  You are all infidels who lack something - in the eyes of some other cult.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Patrioticsoul3 @JerryAbsolute @Khushal30459869 @mathewskluke @ArminNavabi @AtheistRepublic And that is the only reason you guys behave like little kids - you want that warm fuzzy feeling.  I care about truth, no matter what it feels like.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@godFreeWorld About a quarter of the lot?  A quick count gave me 41 and I'm sure I forgot a few...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@logosaetos Yes, they aren't.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@miketheartist42 @Tatoo121010101 @Evangelion217 @StarTrekRoom @StarTrek @StdSucks Yep, he keeps whining.  Gotta say, it's more entertaining than STD. 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dera_Africana "Thank you." to whomever did something to make me feel grateful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Evangelion217 @StarTrekRoom @StarTrek Worked you up just fine 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Evangelion217 @StarTrekRoom @StarTrek That's just your opinion, and we already established what that is worth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atheist_bad You think your mom was tough on you?!  Guess again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Evangelion217 @StarTrekRoom @StarTrek You do realize that I'm still here, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Evangelion217 @StarTrekRoom @StarTrek Sure... That's why you keep trying to tell me that I'm not a fan.  https://t.co/8CduduXwaj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logosaetos Hands up if you want to be bacon!  Me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logosaetos What a cutie! And tasty, I bet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Evangelion217 @StarTrekRoom @StarTrek Nah, you're just upset someone doesn't like your lame show.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Evangelion217 @StarTrekRoom @StarTrek "Seem" is the magic word here. As you only accept people who like what you like, you are not exactly a reliable source. And talking with Trekkies around me, I know only 1 who likes STD. And guess what, mainly because of Tilly - of all the possibilities!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Evangelion217 @StarTrekRoom @StarTrek Of course it's my opinion and you're getting all worked up over it.  Look at the writers of STD, see how they just don't react to my opinion?  Despite writing STD, they clearly have enough sense to say: Oh, he doesn't like the show. Oh well...  You seem to have a problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Evangelion217 @StarTrekRoom @StarTrek Still here, still telling you STD sucks. And, as you're someone who's into STD, guess what your opinion is worth to Trekkies. 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Evangelion217 @StarTrekRoom @StarTrek Still here. Still not caring a lot about how you don't like to hear that STD sucks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logosaetos I do have an affinity for people who don't look like me, yes. Mainly the East Asian type - which might explain my wife 🤷‍♂️ That doesn't mean, though, that I would run away from Caucasians just because they're white.  Essentially, if I find someone attractive I'm attracted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zwillingsmami87 Dann ist gut. 😊<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MaidenSarah1 Was it something you said? 🤣😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heimsittich The latter. The idiots have always been there, only now technology has become easy enough for them to use.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheExpanseWR @ExpanseOnPrime I am SO looking forward to this!  #TheExpanse<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Khushal30459869 @NorbuSpanish @AtheistRepublic May be so, yes. And?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCMhere Same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder Sorry to hear that. If you need any help, let me know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mork_v No clue. I don't care about who directed what. I even only vaguely remember most actors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NiggaAtheist They can't. The moment they do it would all fall apart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FawkesyFox October last year - we visited England.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Dragonlady152 And you!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mork_v In this case, obviously more than what you're usually drinking. They need to see how you get rid of it all again.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Patrioticsoul3 @JerryAbsolute @Khushal30459869 @mathewskluke @ArminNavabi @AtheistRepublic 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣 And you talk about logic!?   That's precious!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ZosKiaCultus666 I wonder how far he gets, studying female orgasm all by himself 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BabeTruth2 Religion taught them that believing is a virtue. Nationalism taught them that they are the good ones, which leads to the obvious conclusion that everyone else is bad. Racism taught them that anyone who doesn't look like them is bad UNLESS they are useful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarTrekRoom @StarTrek Nah. #StarTrekDiscovery sucks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KonHaubner Nein.  Ich wüsste nicht, welche Meinung ich hätte, derer ich mich schämen sollte. Geschweige denn eine Meinung die illegal wäre.  Habe ich Meinungen, die Andere nicht gut finden würden? Na das hoff' ich doch!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NorbuSpanish @AtheistRepublic If you want to be the idiot who loses right of the bat (Godwin's Law) at least pay attention.  It's "being after someone" not "being behind someone" that is bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JGatsby07 Both articles about ppl feeling offended. Still no connection to people being murdered for the colour of their skin.  You still look like you're trying to use an important issue to lend importance to your own.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelDonigan Don't worry, you won't ever go to hell. Enjoy life!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JGatsby07 Then explain why you pointed at #BLM while talking about #SexyKali.  Why do you feel the need to conflate people being murdered for their skin colour with some non-issue like a character in a juvenile story?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarkCloset911 @Poeight This is pretty much the level I am at, yes. I only know about some historian talking about the "followers of Mohammed" invading some place...  This sounds a lot like Tacitus, describing what Christians believed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarkCloset911 @Poeight Alright you guys, I'm fully with you on JC and Moses - I'm not yet deeply enough informed on the subject of Mohammed.  Can you give me some pointers?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JGatsby07 Person who doesn't understand the difference between religion and racism insulting every human who has ever encountered racism by equating it with pictures of a fictional character.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ras_hmi_Tweet @Hat1111Anon @AtheistRepublic Oh, nice. Thanks, I will just block it then. Real or not, it's not a loss.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hat1111Anon @Ras_hmi_Tweet @AtheistRepublic The "ugly turn" is, for example, people like you equating a fictional character being drawn with real people getting hurt and killed in the real world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aelurotheist 🤣😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ras_hmi_Tweet @Hat1111Anon @AtheistRepublic When they feel threatened in their power they start attacking the press - always.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Aliena32616760 @ArminNavabi @AtheistRepublic Nope. Kali is a character in a story.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Luckysharma__ @Hat1111Anon @AtheistRepublic I teach my child that vulgarity may be frowned upon and thus is a thing to be handled with care, but it's not a bad thing in itself.

<|startoftext|>@NiggaAtheist Because they are insecure as fuck and they are told to get upset about someone drawing a picture of their favourite pedophile.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@utkarshrastogik @tweets_rm @ExmuslimsOrg Obviously I haven't, otherwise I hadn't asked. And no, stories, certainly history, don't begin with Greeks.

<|startoftext|>@Hat1111Anon @AtheistRepublic It's insulting that you still try to conflate religion and racism.  Real human beings getting murdered for being black is NOT EVEN REMOTELY in the vicinity of your favourite imaginary character being ridiculed.  So, stop pretending and grow up.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wsa_buendnis @FridayForFuture Sieht eher aus wie ein Trainingsvideo...  "So, ihr in Zivil, geht jetzt mal auf die Linie der Polizei zu und bedrängt sie.

<|startoftext|>@RCReed40 What did you put in there?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SueBoobinks Signed.  Thank you #Norsemen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People, this is important. When you're being told that you have the right to remain silent, that you do not have to say anything, it's being done so for a good reason.  You will be asked later if you want to make a statement, which is fine, but remember: you don't want to.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Matt_Dillahunty He won't be.  Come on. Does anyone really believe that they'll touch him?  About the Covid, though, I don't buy it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eater__of_Souls That must have been like... 1998 or something.  No, wait! In 2005/2006 a gay friend of mine told me about some girl talking about me and he said: Just because I agree with her I'm telling you she said you're hot.  Ahh, good times. 😊<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ZosKiaCultus666 Kjekk  But now I'm interested what "a Britney" would have been.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RevNFidel As someone else put it quite right today: only people who don't want to admit that they are pro-Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllistairGraham @RTheatheist The most basic ideas behind the scientific method already contradict theism.  Namely scepticism, falsifiability and the understanding that evidence is key.  Since there is no evidence for any god, theism is based on faith alone and that's it.  Proven facts are cherries on top.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RTheatheist @karlabreu It's another way of saying atheism is just another religion...  Typical religious BS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZosKiaCultus666 Such assholes. Where is that karma those idiots keep talking about?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@missmegaphon  https://t.co/RUu4uUXYCq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whomeverett True, that's a hassle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rbdwarf Alright! I'm in!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whomeverett The eggs make a tasty salad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LastKobeAlive 🤔 Ich glaube ich hab so ein Ding irgendwann in den 90ern mal probiert. Muss ich das jetzt noch ausrechnen oder kann ich mich gleich als selbstverliebt abheften?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AntitheistCrsd Congrats! But the way to celebrate, if it is what I think it is, you may want to look for another volunteer 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheFigen Surely, a scene from a movie, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bowrie I can't even listen to this guy speak any more. That and I didn't expect anything out of it anyway - so I decided to not watch.  Instead I watched a documentary on Netflix about how Greenpeace started. Was nice. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bowrie Felt masochistic, did ya?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@badwolf303 @says_also @MeidasTouch This is a perfect "How America looks to the rest of the world and how America sees itself"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whomeverett I haven't seen it myself but I'm sure it's not worth wasting your time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KlatuBaradaNiko I eat insects without even thinking about saving a planet. 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ValaeronDH @DieHumanisten Aus dem Stand würden mir da das Sonderrecht auf Körperverletzung einfallen - Beschneidung, also.  Beichtgeheimnis bei Straftaten.  Oder die simple Meinungsfreiheit entgegen §166 StGB.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Die Pest! Verdammt wann hört dieses Jahr endlich auf?!    https://t.co/K0DYeur1rf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mithos1987 Oh, ein Kai! Sehr hübsch!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaidenSarah1 Someone had been driving behind a person who had fired at some Nazis sitting on a bench a bit off from the road and some bullet casings dropped on the hood of his/her car. That someone felt threatened and filed a complaint with the police.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logosaetos 🤣😂🤣😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@puppenbein1 @abraxasvs @creamspeak Auch schön, ja.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irolands @livingforjc  https://t.co/6dHZJOy22h<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@livingforjc Let's ignore all the holy books of other religions out there and just ask: Which bible?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Theresaroets911 Nope. All the homosexual couples with children I know, have been giving the idea of a child a lot of thought beforehand and went to great lengths to have a child.  These children are wanted, prepared for and thus already highly unlikely to be neglected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kriegsbeute Nur eine 1?!  Dafür hätte ich mindestens drei vergeben!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aelurotheist @KonHaubner  https://t.co/Unh5DPwJ8L<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aelurotheist @KonHaubner Ach komm, da geht doch noch was.  Hast du schon gehört, dass #Krishna wirklich gelebt haben soll?  So, jetzt hast du noch einen mehr 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorsemenO I am as devastated as Arvid.  Why?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Talija8189 Lecker essen gehen?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KonHaubner Das wusste ich noch nicht.  Schön, mal sehen was ich heute anstellen kann...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whomeverett Oh yeah...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@naturegirlkenie Of course!  The good thing is, though, that one does not think anymore that it's the same as falling in love with someone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DameAomame @abraxasvs @creamspeak Backen, mein Tipp.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abraxasvs @creamspeak Wie gesagt, ist flexibel.  Man muss den Kram nicht rauchen 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RLuiton @creamspeak 😂🤣😂🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pixieapfelbaum @creamspeak Oh, feine Idee!  👏👏👏👏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amy_greenwell @natureslover_s My thought, exactly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aelurotheist Ja, gleich nachdem ich das Einhorn gefangen hatte, dass mit meinem fliegenden Teppich abhauen wollte!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PhadingDark 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂  I'm guessing No.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skt_johann Ich hatte eigentlich gedacht, dass trotzdem der Eine oder Andere drunter schreibt Agnostiker zu sein.  Schön, dass es bisher geklappt hat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EbonySkeptic 😂🤣😂🤣 Nope.  I wouldn't do pro bono for someone I'd consider quite guilty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog 😂🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@creamspeak Gerade in späteren Einstiegen würde ich eher zum Gras tendieren.  Wer will denn später noch mit dem Kopf voll E durch die Clubs springen?  Nee, Dope ist vielseitig und passt gut zum Garten mit kleinem Häuschen 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidTheNonBot Both.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EbonySkeptic When you asked him if he's feeble minded - did you deem him feeble minded?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoritzLindeman1 @sart26409389 @ChristianHKuhn @DHeuwer Abstinenz ist auch nur Sex wieder jeder andere Sex auch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Abstinenz ist auch nur eine Art von Sex wie jede Andere auch.  🤦‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EbonySkeptic Heh, fucked if I know what "truly evil" means 🤷‍♂️  I'm just saying that he complained about being called feeble minded while you just asked if he is. Amd then he asked about something "truly evil in the atheistic world"...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EbonySkeptic Wait... To use your own words, he just asked a question. He didn't say you were evil.  😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DHeuwer Und die Antwort auf deine 2. Frage:  Weil es nicht auch nur den Hauch eines Beweises für irgendwelche #Götter, geschweige denn einen #Gott gibt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DHeuwer Weil #Glaube blindes Folgen zu einer Tugend erhebt.  Weil "leichtgläubig" und "gläubig" das Gleiche sind, nur, dass Eines irgendwie respektabel sein soll. 🤷‍♂️  Weil ALLE, die auf Betrüger hereingefallen sind, geglaubt haben anstatt zu hinterfragen.  Kurz, ich mag kein #Opfer sein.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan Essentially, all he needs to do is drop a line once in a while and let Trump react.  1. Trump will self destruct  2. Biden doesn't risk losing track of his own words.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Und wieder dieser Unsinn mit emotionaler Bindung zu Tegel...  Der #BER war, ist und bleibt ein schlechter Witz. Dieses ständige "emotionale Bindung zu Tegel" ist peinlich. Hat man doch schon im Kindergarten gelernt: "Auf Andere zeigen..."   https://t.co/wyPRDbDNLt via @faznet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mhdksafa Since I don't know beforehand if they thank me or not, that too does not prevent me from holding a door open. 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@escaped_ferret Because someone planned ahead for an air con without annoying cables?  @Elishabenabuya 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aelurotheist 👏👏👏👏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gumboqueen3030 Utter bullshit.  And ANY police officer making such a statement needs to be off the force just because of that statement alone!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParosTom Of course not. That would be ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotLordByron Cute, for disgusting stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zwillingsmami87 Ich mag deinen Mann immer mehr.  Lieve Grüße!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zwillingsmami87 Ich kann mir solche Gefühle natürlich nur vorstellen, aber auch ich möchte Dir sagen, dass ich daran gar nichts dumm finde.  Niemand kann etwas für seine Gefühle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiamondLynne1  https://t.co/rNYAcqs7fX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zebusrugby Hopefully. But I doubt it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MamaMammut @Snoozedanger Bei der Polizei abgegeben und eine Anzeige wegen illegalen Waffenbesitzes einfangen?  Nee, lieber auf nem dunklen Parkplatz an einer Autobahn an finstere Gestalten verkaufen. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Strandjunker Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AntitheistCrsd You'll do it next time something goes sideways 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZosKiaCultus666 Whatever made you think that?  And no, I don't even need to hear her ideas on gender.   Eva Ibbotson, now she is worth considering to be one of the good ones 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@St_Manches This was fun.  Oh, and yes: Cool.    https://t.co/mNqiP4Evab<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logosaetos Oh, okay...  Where can I go to drop off all that primate genetic material that I obviously don't need?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZosKiaCultus666 Come on, this is a questionnaire for teens...  Where's the fun questions?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heimsittich Aren't they always?  A bridge was closed, or some tree lay across the street...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Drstevenhobbs  https://t.co/lRqStVkdE9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCReed40 Only, I don't think any respect was due.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marczimmermann 😂🤣😂🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@garci32 Well, he's dumb enough to do so, but no, I don't think he does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Commodore1351 @RobertClaus13 @LukasStichmann @tazgezwitscher Und in Thailand ist es ja bekanntlich kein Problem Hitler und/oder Nazis toll zu finden...  Da werd ich doch gleich mal in den beiden mir bekannten Camps nachfragen müssen, ob die da auch Nazis trainieren. Obwohl ich davon ausgehe, dass sie zu weit ab vom Schuss sind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmdyRemdy Ich besitze nichts was mir peinlich wäre. Warum sollte ich auch?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorsemenO Congratulations to the well deserved award!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ItalianApologia Nice story.  So what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pixienic Sure. How else would I survive festivals, camping trips or the like?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZenaMOBrien @St_Manches I just got my daughter started on Southpark last week and she is now deeply immersed in it.  Yes, I am proud. 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WordsDawn Because they are gullible suckers who believe anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whitesithmale Yes, yes I am.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsbeyondbelief No severe diseases in children.  The ability to grow back limbs.  Magic being possible.  And, on a personal note:  No mosquitoes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dyslexic_aDve Thai Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn  And I still am proud to have had the chance, however brief it was.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jimirvinuk Really? Nobody?  Perfect - Fairground Attraction Perfect - The Smashing Pumpkins<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiamondLynne1 Oh yeah! That stick is perfect to scratch dog piles off my boots!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bergziege9 Der letzte Satz ist hier mein absoluter Liebling.  Sehr treffend zusammengefasst.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heimsittich I wonder if they actually think that any woman feels interested when getting these messages which would make them idiots or if they get off on women being harassed, which makes them assholes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heimsittich Oh, nobody wanted to play with you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heimsittich Certainly many more invitations?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AntitheistCrsd Makes me ask: What's wrong with them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@qikipedia There's something I hadn't thought of trying yet...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tuxiterano @craggy_island Ach so! Ja...  Ein Pfanne über zu haben ginge ja noch ganz einfach. Ein Schweißgerät könnte man sich irgendwo noch leihweise besorgen. Aber ich hab jetzt leider keine überflüssigen Schwerter rumliegen...  Aber, kommt Zeit kommt Schwert und dann irgendwann auch Nahkampfpfanne. 😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aelurotheist Ein Replikator.  Dafur würde ich sogar einen recht hohen Kredit aufnehmen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tuxiterano @craggy_island Mega diese Pfanne! Wo kriegt man denn sowas?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jusfails Well deserved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tuxiterano Wie kannst du auch aus zwei eine ZWEI machen? Also, hör mal...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hailsnow @WarriorClayton1 Thank you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Elishabenabuya Well, it may not be what you wanted but you got what you asked for. 🤷‍♂️  Reminds me of the three wishes a djinn grants you...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rak_strong Found my answer to this question a while ago.  Teleportation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tperlen Egal, Hauptsache mit Weinigstens 1,5 m Abstand!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LAguja44 @logosaetos @spookymalt 🤣 I thought you might...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mterr337 All is well.  Welcome back!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiamondLynne1 That is huge!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hat1111Anon 😂🤣😂🤣 Need some dressing with that salad?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiamondLynne1 Oh, he'd have to share those with me, if we met!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notcapnamerica Yep. Just made the appointment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharlieSkeptic @CelticTiger357 @RevKevDeYoung Cool.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DaxGigandet  https://t.co/uc5MW9IG80<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@c0ns_ti I'm saying yes.  I am currently considering to do so myself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, and I am terribly sorry to have missed the opportunity to say that the video was originally posted by @Kevinliptakcnn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Every1s_Mama @Kevinliptakcnn "sane" AND "god-fearing" ?   😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sven_Sational70 @ParosTom Well, it would be, right?  But then... When some religious person gets a grip and leaves religion and thus stops praying that, too, then would be god's plan. So, again, god wants atheists and he wants them to grow in numbers.  https://t.co/8QblfYrYWB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EbonySkeptic @realDonaldTrump "Vote him out!"  A demand I can fully get behind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@craggy_island @LillyBlaudszun 😳  Macht Spaß. Sind lecker.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LillyBlaudszun Dass Alter respektiert werden soll, nur weil es halt da ist.  Dass Kindern Blödsinn erzählt wird, weil "es doch schön" ist.  Dass man für jeden Dünnpfiff eine Erlaubnis oder Bescheinigung braucht, aber Kinder machen darf Jeder. Abtreibung ist allerdings was ganz was Schlimmes...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whomeverett Sounds ducking good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As everyone is posting it, so will I. This is one of the finer moments in US history. Keep posting and playing this video until he's gone!  #WorstPresidentEver @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/vfja5QK4HV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fe_CLAD @JohnRMoffitt I have saved the video.  This is video needs to be kept by all means. For as long as there is any human left alive!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kraftmacncheese @kraftdinner You just earned a mute.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@minhtngo Nope,sorry. This look has been used for decades, Americans just hadn't seen it before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCMhere Yes, he was. But I gotta admit at that event it was overcrowded or whatever - the sound could pretty much have been anything.  But this time it was clearly audible and the chant was as if they stood right next to you.  It was beautiful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logosaetos @HarphamPeg  https://t.co/EeLNwu0wnP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mork_v @curcey1 Yep, Lego, as cool as it is (and I agree it is cool) never really appealed to me. Certainly not as a video game.  My daughter played Lego Worlds for a while and it was fun and all, but after a while... Well, things looked pretty much the same 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logosaetos @spookymalt Hey, I'm fully with you there - back in school we had basketball (weirdly I always played with the girls 'cause the guys were "too cool") and muay thai. 🤷‍♂️  Boxing just doesn't come up as often as this or that ball game.  Right, @LAguja44?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mork_v @curcey1 Nope, never have and am almost certain that I won't.  From what I've seen, it's not my thing at all.  I enjoy beautiful games. Like... Like Assassin's Creed Odyssey or even Origin. Or, like Last of Us 1 AND 2, or Far Cry...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logosaetos @spookymalt Boxing?! I like you more and more!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NuckChorris16 Hate his life, not yours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Serious question for the #Americans out there:  Has there ever been a president who was booed like this?  I understand dislike for this or that president...   But a president facing utter disrespect of a crowd booing the president at a public event?  #WorstPresidentEver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tonyposnanski @Acosta He did not say he would.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blueheartedly @albinofirebird Does the pope shit in the woods?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DiamondLynne1  https://t.co/2jJ6dD8BGU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@curcey1 Since I only played one of them...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spookymalt @logosaetos Cool!  And here comes the fun bit - I had only heard about flag football a couple of months ago. A friend of ours, an American living here in Berlin, plays it and we were absolutely clueless...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@curcey1 Oh, I'm sorry!  She looks like a friendly girl. 😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@curcey1 Looks like a friendly fella! 😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tachyon100 Add-on.  I was supposed to call the plumber about installing a filter. 🤦‍♂️  So, walking around the house wouldn't even have made a difference...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heimsittich Sagen wir mal so, das Angebot steht. Ich selbst wurde in meiner Ausbildung durch einen guten Freund mit Futter versorgt - manchmal ist es halt so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heimsittich Die Antwort darauf kommt natürlich nur in'ner DM. Wenn's jetzt also *ping macht, keine Sorge, es ist nix Böses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heimsittich Oh Mist... Brauchst du was warmes zu Essen? Wir haben morgen eh Übernachtungsbesuch, da wird es genug zu Essen geben, dass einer mehr keinen Unterschied macht. Heute ist Essen zwar schon gelaufen, aber wenn dringend ist kriegen wir das auch noch hin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PumaBare After downsizing thinking from supranational to national level, the logical next step is local borders.  With village sheriffs and all...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sdr_medco @alex_nman And it shall be tweeted daily until November!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrWitnesser And the kids go: headshot for Jesus!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logosaetos BTW you just sent me down a YouTube rabbit hole of Frisbee...  Some real nice throws and catches there!  Not at all like what we played at the beach 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logosaetos Okay... Looks like a very quick sport.  AND, as I can see, Thailand is in there too! Why haven't I heard of this before?  Maybe because I was too distracted by Takraw 😀  Yeah, that was the only sport event that EVER caught my interest!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robertwood2005 This I have to agree with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jacobecarson Sadly you deleted the tweet so I have to tell you this way:  T-shirts! Definitely t-shirts!  And I will take one each.  https://t.co/dHQcTQDIaB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robertwood2005 Then the war would come to them...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lsjngs @KlatuBaradaNiko Don't ever piss her off! She's going to slap you into the next ice age.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This video gave me a little #hope that he actually might be voted out in November.  Not that I believe that, mind you, it's the #US after all.  But, a glimpse of hope is there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tachyon100 Perfect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaxGigandet Oh hell yeah!  https://t.co/fN68mCbRxs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hairybadger74 @Tachyon100 @SidTheBody I must say, the AZERTY seems reasonable if you want to type "@"  It's more of an A than a Q, anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hairybadger74 @Tachyon100 @SidTheBody I assumed as much.  But now I was interested and looked it up.  What do ya know? It seem to be only zee Germans and zee French who have this exceptional keyboard.  🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logosaetos Even from the pictures I would have guessed football, but Frisbee and even ultimate Frisbee?  I don't even have a clue what that is. Is it Frisbee with some kind of scoring and the loser has to die or something?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@baconbkk @JustinTouriste Oh, that does make it better!   I don't mind an evening out for 3000.  There used to be a Greek Restaurant on Ekkamai where we went sometimes. An evening easily got up to the thousands but yes, worth it.  So, I might check out the place, when I get back there at some point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tobymorton Pretzel sticks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder @rbdwarf So, it's kind of a BYOC situation...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baconbkk @JustinTouriste I'm sorry, but 3000 baht for an omelet...😳  บ้าหรือเปล่า  I know gar prizes have gone up, but...  But, please, don't mind me. I sincerely am happy that you enjoyed it. I just rather stick to my Kai Yad Sai from around the corner and for that money invite half the Soi to join.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rbdwarf @tanja__eder Nope, we ate'em all.  After all - we're the bad guys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baconbkk @JustinTouriste Oh, I totally missed that @JustinTouriste answered for you!  Ha, then I hope you had a good time 😀.  Yep, price might be an issue there. With all the street vendors and many of them offering very, very tasty food - I'm not sure I'd be willing to pay that kind of money 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder Then I would never rob you!   One crow doesn't hack another's eye out.  😂🤣😂🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder @aelurotheist Wenn jemand lange Worte benutzt, die man mal irgendwann gehört aber nicht richtig verstanden hat, dann hat er bestimmt Ahnung... 🤦‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nordvvind @MissFlocke 🤣😂🤣😂 Trollkarl?! Wie genial ist das denn?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder Yes! Become one of us!  Come to the dark side!  https://t.co/3AHXNDL2V4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder @aelurotheist Aber das ist doch das tolle an den Esos. Die müssen den Kram ja nicht verstehen, die brauchen nur irgendwelche wissenschaftlich klingende Worte und machen daraus ihren Salat.  Zack, Geschwurbel ist fertig. Und irgendeine arme Sau wird's schon glauben. 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder Okay, for you I make an exception.  I would leave you one of these. See? Contact possible AND if you're MacGyver-inclined, maybe you can build it into a Twitter machine 🤣  https://t.co/NYgyUglQY4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aelurotheist Ich glaube Zeit alleine wird da nicht reichen...  Ich habe gerade ein sehr schmerzhaftes Kopfkino von einem Eso der versucht Quantengravitation zu erläutern und zu erklären wie man damit Fußpilz heilt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder It's not like they're going to die...  https://t.co/IrGTeS1nhC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustinTouriste @baconbkk Right! Yes, I remember. I've seen some documentary about her!  Thanks.  And I hope you had a good time there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cptnrawrpnts 🤢 Nay!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCReed40 Sharknado, Zombeaver...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gumboqueen3030 Newton was already sleeping...  https://t.co/y1hC2vdz7E<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gumboqueen3030 😍 Good evening Finn!  Yes, here we're getting ready for the night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Power and charger cables.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@debrakay852 @fireman452a Leviticus 20:13  There it is. But you're right, it doesn't specifically say "hanging".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erudita96 @fireman452a They say the same thing about other Christians. But I'm sure you know that.  🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@czarim1950 @WOsrin And see what they got now! Could've had Clinton, now they have Biden...   🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WOsrin Americans.  Specially those who voted for him and those who didn't vote at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EverydayisCK @baconbkk Damn! That could have been dangerous!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NiggaAtheist Judas is very much needed and vital to the plan, yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zwillingsmami87 Da gibt's nur ein paar kleine Momente und davon sind die meisten nur etwaige Techtelmechtel welche nie stattgefunden haben. Also nix Wichtiges 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tachyon100 That's alright. You can call it vegan and it's a good thing 😉  My wife once thought we could get an air fryer, but we decided an oven pretty much does the same thing and scotch eggs are only good deep fried. 🤤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tachyon100 Ohhh, nice!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheAlmightyGod8 @DevinVandriel My thought exactly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DevinVandriel Ordering a lady from an upper class escort service is NO date.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bissmahmehmud @cadelaesquisita  https://t.co/pe4pU9Ws7L<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tachyon100 So, how did the story end?  Do the electrics work?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just bought meself a fresh couple of whisky bottles today, arrived home from work and my wonderful wife has prepared Georgian BBQ as a surprise!  What a wonderful day!  https://t.co/f1dLD87Lnx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baconbkk She looks familiar...  Remind me, please, who is she again?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baconbkk @EverydayisCK Woah...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EllersDad Such a cutie!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCReed40 So he doubled down?  What a tool.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DieMeZi Dann auch dir Hallo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Talija8189 Eh, hör auf so'ne Scheiße zu träumen! Da kriegt man ja Panik!  Ich hoffe dir geht es inzwischen wieder besser...  https://t.co/1vZ7ItUMDg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UprightSiddy Salesman for wine.  I liked and still like the wine, but selling stuff isn't my thing at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_sinewave_ Was für Wichser.  Antwort ist Ja!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Talija8189 Oha... Kein schöner Abend.  Aber zumindest alles gut.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParosTom Aliens. With the size of the cosmos it is highly unlikely that our rock is the only one with life on it. Bigfoot? Like any other myth, highly unlikely to actually exist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rbdwarf Depends on how high it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Xynyx2001 That's why I was so surprised that it's so good. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Xynyx2001 I just had that again yesterday!   I was surprised to find it's actually a good whiskey 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DocAtCDI That is very sneaky. I like it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DocAtCDI I was hoping for the pun at the end.  Okay...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanielleAmes10 @Geranthrimin  https://t.co/SNkVzWARey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marczimmermann Hallo Marc!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dittrich_lars Okay, Bolivien ist also auch raus...  Schade.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCReed40 Guess how relieved I was to find, that I didn't follow that guy.  Solid unfollow if I had (which is why I checked).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCReed40 @camglamming And I see you already gave the best possible answer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meckernfueralle Erst hatte ich die Frage falsch gelesen...  Nun also die richtige Antwort auf deine Frage:  Nein. Gibt es nicht. Diskriminierung ist immer Scheiße.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gerade im Restaurant mitgehört:  "Diese ganze Hochschulscheiße. Das gab's bei uns nicht. Da biste 8. Klasse abgegangen und fertig."  Man(n) fährt übrigens Dodge RAM...  Noch Fragen?  https://t.co/Tqxro8fNbK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DemocracyInn @GinaUSAblue It isn't already?  😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣  Ah, the #US - worried about mommies feeding their babies in public and 18yr olds drinking beer but totally fine with shit like this.  Oh, and assault rifles for everyone!  What a truly fucked up country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zwillingsmami87 Wird Zeit. Ich bring Dir noch etwas Benzin dazu!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrainRage @universal_sci @WorldAndScience You, sir, just earned a follow.  However little that may mean to you. 😀<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SheriAWilkinson Why? That's what religion is all about - the money!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logosaetos Damn, now I'm hungry...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@zwillingsmami87 Also bist der Kevin? Sonst stellt doch keiner Fragen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zwillingsmami87 Wow...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zwillingsmami87 😂🤣😂🤣😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder @qikipedia I should already be dead!  But, there you go, what doesn't kill you...  Well, what hasn't killed you yet may do so later 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AtheistStreet Oh? What part of science inconveniences her?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AboveAverageTom Sure. All it takes is a little ingenuity and the understanding that almost all living things are food.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThatEricAlper Spaceships.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sven_Sational70 @atheist_bad Heh, as long as it's not that lame neighbour of mine...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@logosaetos  https://t.co/5UrDPicNzx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atheist_bad Yeah, what nonsense is this?  I'd only be ashamed to believe in this prick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tachyon100 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂  That would be Black Mama for me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sven_Sational70 @Elishabenabuya 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣 You'd think...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pegnitzpirat @Kommunikation80 @a5linksab @Snoozedanger Danke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@a5linksab @Snoozedanger Ein weiteres Beispiel als Antwort auf die ewige Frage in der Schule:  Wozu sollen wir das denn lernen?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmyAThatcher I don't watch football ever.  It annoys me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCMhere And someone was happy, I bet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZosKiaCultus666 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😂  https://t.co/vTgfyHBK8E<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonCallighan @irolands Wait, how do you know unicorns aren't real, yet Jesus is?  The bible? Amongst the characters in that story there is a unicorn, too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logosaetos Oh, it is. Mary Rose was from the Philippines. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skepticsusanna @ArminNavabi Wow! How far behind some people can be...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logosaetos Matter of fact, I have.  Back in the day being close to a certain Mary Rose, I also got to try some food.  Gotta say, though, not really my thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Elishabenabuya Damn, that would scare even me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heimsittich Well, for some of us it's 41 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NuckChorris16 Nah, for Sister Amalia that's just a Tuesday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1980Dorothy You messed up a chair and bought a new one?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@logosaetos @Julius_Kim See? That was a couple of coherent sentences. I think you're doing fine. 😉  And yes, the more one uses a language the better one gets.  It's as if practice makes better 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Julius_Kim Typos aren't important at all.  Grammatical errors can happen and are as such not important either.  Bad grammar, however, makes people look uneducated at least.  Worst case, it may look completely unhinged.  To be able to express a certain point one needs a grasp of grammar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@j_potatoe @KonHaubner Oder so, ja.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KonHaubner Ich habe noch gelernt, dass persönliche Anrede großgeschrieben wird. Inzwischen ist es, glaube ich, völlig egal. Ich hab für mich entschieden, dass großgeschrieben wird wer es verdient hat, alle Anderen bleiben klein.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Snoozedanger Selbst Omas können auch so richtig Scheiße sein...  Das tut mir leid für euch.  Falls ihr noch nach 'ner netten Oma suchen wollt, ich wette da draußen gibt's so Einige. Und garantiert besser als so eine Trulla.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCReed40 @youtillagamer Some people will do just about anything to get those 5 minutes...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Elishabenabuya Normally I would go for Howie but this time, sadly, that's a hard sell.  But then again, there are those who are worried that Trump will win again.  Sorry, but it wouldn't be a huge surprise for the US to do that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Elishabenabuya So, not very good porn then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Renevelation I'm still going with the idea that, as a mathematical necessity, 50% of people are below average intelligence.  And average, as we all know, already isn't exactly great.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Elishabenabuya Sounds reasonable...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bergziege9 Inzwischen heißt es: Maske vergessen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheFigen I like him!  He does not give a flying fuck.  Cool dude.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheFigen The first drop I felt an poof, but then...  They are great!  👏👏👏👏👏👏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hippiepop2 Depends which sauce I make.  For my wife and myself only? No sugar.  Making the kind of sauce we had in school, for my child and her guests? Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoHolyScripture It's so blurry this could just as well be a video of Bigfoot doing ballet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LibRehab @Renevelation Wait, in that particular example you suggest the answer is: Yes, you can.  It's called self defense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WILLIBALDSCHMI1 @freshcuber @MGENBlog Wie genau soll dieser Maßstab aussehen? Leere Phrasen helfen hier nicht.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This! If you need to see anything today, it is THIS!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DiamondLynne1 When that seaside resort has been taken over by the Russian tourists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@levi_bullen I only remember being called "love"   Don't even know what her names was 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LinuxGal @CriticalCripple That's so cute!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davestewart4444 @Tachyon100 Right?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tachyon100 Sure I would!  Ghosts can't lie. It's like when you're asking someone if they're a cop...  Also, wherever these coordinates are, there be rum!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BevanneTX Read some answers in this thread and I can honestly say I can't imagine how hard it must be to be together with a Trumpster. Also, it's weird how this keeps going to being Christian.  Supporting Trump simply shows that one does not care about human welfare.  That's it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erin_hartigan4 @tallgirlL @godmother_nanny @BevanneTX Then there's your answer. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you have survived the #80ies as a teenager and managed to come out of them with your pride intact I can promise you that you will like #CobraKai!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder Heyhey! Welcome back!  Good to see you again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NL237i Running wild sometimes 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaidenSarah1 Yay! Congrats!  That is, if you wanted her to say yes...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@krisnogud @Snoozedanger Okay, hatte keinen zu großen Effekt.  Ich mache die brutale Medienlandschaft dafür verantwortlich, dass selbst diese schrecklichen Bilder keine Reaktion mehr hervorrufen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@krisnogud @Snoozedanger Nein, aber ich kenne da jemanden.  Warte mal, ich geh mal kurz ins andere Zimmer...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NL237i Why would I want that?  https://t.co/Mt3fdsCksR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nicks2007mom Less resistance while swimming? I seem to remember some guys shaved their heads because of that... 🤔  Nah, kidding, no reason at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClaireLind5 Then don't look at it until you have saved up some more, or I hope your investment pays off - then, by all means look at it. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClaireLind5 😂🤣😂🤣  Sorry, did you not yet see the PS5?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrinceOfAtheism Water it down. And no coffee for the next few hours. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mork_v Rarely, yes. Mostly I just want to point and laugh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justa70sgirl @ida_skibenes And she's right to be furious. She's also right that nothing will change.  Biden is the worst choice the democrats could have made.  The issue however is simply, that any vote not given against Trump is a vote for Trump.  Politics suck. Sorry. 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZosKiaCultus666 😂😏😂😏 Yep, those sell-outs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤦‍♂️  Es wird Zeit, dass die Menschen aussterben.   https://t.co/FQFKtvKa8d<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@diyajoshi Yep, them just entering the room makes that happen. But I just switch to "ignore" and go on with my day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mork_v Just this one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZosKiaCultus666 Ah, what bliss to live in a German spoken part of the world. 🤣😂🤣😂  Trousers are only plural if you have more than a pair. 😉<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RCReed40 It's not?!  But then... Why are they showing this to us?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Da hat doch vor ein paar Wochen mal so'ne Trulla gefragt warum man die FDP nicht wählen würde...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mamjahid Danke! Hab's gerade an mein Kind weitergeleitet - die haben das Thema nämlich gerade in der Schule 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mr_plantato @JoyceSHarris @JTHVerhovek @KeithOlbermann If it's a week.  One day after a new judge is chosen Trump will fist a kitten in the rose garden and everyone will talk about that. 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nordvvind @DoubleDumas Right?  Or, as an idea, one could ask the local Trumpster/Afder/village idiot to spell out a long word (like "boat", or sth) and use their misspelled version of the word.  Nobody can guess that shit!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@The_Ouroboros__ @RCReed40 Well, it's Egypt 🤷‍♂️ But at least he's out of a job now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NiggaAtheist Would be nice, if there was one...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArchaeoLilith Oh yes, very nice!  I miss Italy...  But if you're in Rome right now, did you know that not too far from the pantheon is a restaurant for over 500 years?  It's the Hostaria dell'Orso - you might like to check it out. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PastorAlexLove Woah...  Must've missed his payments for weeks, huh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCReed40 Casserole, definitely.  Nicely mixing meat with dairy products...  Hell, that's why he invented Christmas, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorsemenO @ConradiKare @MarianSOttesen Gotta hand to him, though, he's made some very nice tunnels down there.  And no, there is nothing suspicious about tunneling, whatsoever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KonHaubner 🤣😂🤣😂  Übersetzt also #wearefucked<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaidenSarah1 It's a trap!  Don't decide on what sounds good to you!  "Your decision" means what SHE likes.  It's not even a "woman-thing"! ANYONE who says that it's your decision wants to be pleasantly surprised.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AntitheistCrsd Getting out again may prove tricky...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AntitheistCrsd You can still make it. Go to the right, take down the lady with the baby first. Use the baby to wack the two guys standing in front of her over the head. Having seen that, the others should be properly shocked to just let you in without even thinking of stopping you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaidenSarah1 And what a cutie!  Well done.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DiamondLynne1, wouldn't this be sth for you? 😘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whomeverett Not even my death penis?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NiggaAtheist 🤣😂 Nah man, I'm good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WILLIBALDSCHMI1 @freshcuber @MGENBlog Na dann mal los, sag was zum Sachverhalt. Du hast behauptet, dass es einen Unterschied gibt und, dass man durch Nutzung des Verstandes diesen erkennen kann.  Wie, schlägst du vor, soll man zwischen einem wahren und einem falschen Glaube unterscheiden?  Wir sind gespannt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@freshcuber @WILLIBALDSCHMI1 @MGENBlog Stimmt. Jetzt wo du es sagst... Da hätt ich drauf kommen sollen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And how is your day going?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jusfails Honestly, this I would love to try!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey #Christians this is YOUR team.  😂🤣😂🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheGothicGoth @shawntheverbose @secularmac @PermissiontoQ Ah, that. Okay, I can see how this went astray.  My idea or emphasis was on the idea of gladly having a drink with Thor and I connected that idea with the story of him almost drinking the sea dry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRealHoarse I'm great, thank you!  Really good sex last night, able to sleep in this morning because of late shift today.  Shift passed calm and easy, so far.  Just a couple of hours left and back home with me.  How are you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheGothicGoth @shawntheverbose @secularmac @PermissiontoQ "method of protestant christianity"?  What "method" is that? Just to believe on faith?  One thing to be said for norse mythology, just like greek mythology, is that it's way more entertaining than all the monotheistic mythologies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SweetSumerThyme  https://t.co/CMhaSkSqqx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scepticdust Just another in a long line of non surprises.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParosTom I try to be "good" but of course I'm not perfect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shawntheverbose @TheGothicGoth @secularmac @PermissiontoQ Maybe he should show up and show us how the tides came to be?  I would gladly try (and fail) to empty the horn myself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WolfTheRed Because no gods have ever been shown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandiMax2 Why are they religious when it's abundantly clear that there is no god?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TraceyC20373474 No. And I would really like to be wrong about this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zwillingsmami87 Weil süßes Frühstück.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Elishabenabuya Yep, used to use it to help a friend who lost all his money in India.  A most useful service.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrinceOfAtheism I do. And, yes, I know how many and whose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theoriebubble Noch 3? Na gut.  Dann 1. Italienisch - einfach weil es so schön klingt. 2. Chinesisch - mal wieder eine ganz  andere Sprachfamilie 3. Klingonisch - lernen soll ja auch Spaß machen 😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ridcorruption Well done, you. Keeping healthy I see.  https://t.co/utfkTG4Z5H<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ridcorruption About 50% close?  As in: "The answer is - both." ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mork_v Yes. I am hoping for someone to tell me that they have a million bucks in gold or such if only I send them a bit of money.  So far, nobody has tried. 🤷‍♂️  But in my job, sadly often, I meet people who have been conned into sending money to some person.  It sucks telling them...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@marczimmermann Genau diese Gedanken habe ich auch, nur, dass ich zu einem anderen Ergebnis komme.

<|startoftext|>@zwillingsmami87 Es wird ausreichend Menschen geben die das mit "Ja." beantworten. Ein Teil von denen wird sogar der Meinung sein, dass man sowas nicht sagen oder lustig finden darf.

<|startoftext|>@zwillingsmami87  https://t.co/rE0TuLZDXU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zwillingsmami87 Jetzt wo ich das gesehen habe frage ich mich: Was haben die Horoskope für den 11. September 2001 gesagt?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MonkInDocs @1776not1619 @ThirdActor @theOGfromtheOT @ZosKiaCultus666 @UllmerSteve I hope we still agree, though, that the same "reading into it" goes for anyone who claims to follow Jesus.  Right? 😉  I'm kidding! I don't expect you to agree with that. That's just my opinion on followers of any religion.  They all believe only what they agree with anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouGarza86 "This has got to be a joke!"  Is what I would have thought before I looked at the world outside my own personal bubble.  Now I don't even wonder anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MonkInDocs @1776not1619 @ThirdActor @theOGfromtheOT @ZosKiaCultus666 @UllmerSteve It doesn't, that's why it's called reading into it 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NuckChorris16 @DavaStarr Right!  Ain't he cute?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavaStarr I've tried. I still don't see a dog.  But I like the picture anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MonkInDocs @1776not1619 @ThirdActor @theOGfromtheOT @ZosKiaCultus666 @UllmerSteve John 14:5-9 ?   The rather straight forward question and the vague answer leave the door open to do anything you want as long as you claim it's in his name.  To clarify, this is not my position on what Jesus teaches (or even Lucy's? 🤷‍♂️), it's just the first thing I thought of.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MonkInDocs @1776not1619 @ThirdActor @theOGfromtheOT @ZosKiaCultus666 @UllmerSteve Hence Jesus being superfluous. His followers read into him whatever they already consider to be right.  Such is religion, as you rightly say, "if she were something else, she'd do the same" - ppl of all faith do exactly that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MonkInDocs @1776not1619 @ThirdActor @theOGfromtheOT @ZosKiaCultus666 @UllmerSteve Yeah, well, you may interpret Jesus in a way that is impossible to support a kind of Trump (in itself a good thing) but looking at Lucy shows, that it is just as possible to use Jesus to support him.  Jesus is superfluous if one can offer reasons for this or that action/opinion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1776not1619 @ThirdActor @MonkInDocs @theOGfromtheOT @ZosKiaCultus666 @UllmerSteve Voting for Trump, someone who happily lets you die if it gives him any kind of benefit, because you don't like ppl's attitude is stupid.  Essentially, you proved them right. 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZosKiaCultus666 Oh, crap. I'm sorry.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@iamAtheistGirl When it's about YOUR boobies - sure. 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamAtheistGirl And we're just believing this without proof... 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ddheruiz Nope. That's what dating is for, to get to know each other. And being a Trumpster or not is as important as being an axe murderer or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brucewayne5687 I drive nothing but stick shift.  Automatic annoys me.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And one more who does not know what a theory is. 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DuluthAtheist @Rachel0ates Yup.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dark Slasher - a fitting name.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DazzDzatron @ZosKiaCultus666 🤣😂 I had the same thought!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZosKiaCultus666 Court appointment?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PastorAlexLove Nope, an important part of becoming an atheist is to exorcize the soul from the aspiring atheist.  Just like a christening, only in reverse, this is done through a ritual called Getting Sucked Dry.  For women it's a little more complicated the ritual for them is called Abortion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EEFaulk @MichelleAkin 👏👏👏<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@whomeverett But he doesn't understand that. Let's hope his son does, at some point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@godless_mom Because #narrativium.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NuckChorris16 Hadn't heard that one yet.  If he said that, I'd certainly agree with him.  It's great he won and all, but why insult the man?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NuckChorris16 Should have declined it, yes.  I'm still waiting for a decent person to do that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheOverlookSC @pinata1138 Worth it.  And it's not just her, there are millions of women from whose legs this would not be a waste at all.  But I have to stop now - I'm getting a little excited. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gunsnrosesgirl3 So, quite like me sleeping.  Yes, I sleep like a drunk teen, totally contorted and coming up for air once in a while.  It's hours of fun to try to sleep next to me. Just ask my wife. 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gunsnrosesgirl3 With that brain to weight ratio it should be so lucky to only be called assfish, could have been named after a certain president.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@itsyaboyvp Good to see that your son at least has a chance to learn something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Elishabenabuya Weird, how she considers a word that could mean anything "handy".  It's almost as if she doesn't like the idea of not being able to tap dance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorbuSpanish @Shivamtyagi1993 @INDcybertroops @AskAnshul @randm_indianguy Even more so, then.  Let these ridiculous gods fight their own wars.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_Bharat_putr @FredMacManus @URRao10 @ArminNavabi Kali is not any other lady who treats you like a son. Every woman who would treat you like a son is a real person. Kali, like wonderwoman, isn't a real person.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GreatHindusthan @india4evr @URRao10 @ArminNavabi Nope, forget it, the one I was asking about was Nehru. Completely different person.  Well then, I shall look it up and see what's what.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DaeDaeSupreme Let's hope!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Caring_Atheist Once you're convinced faith is a good way to decide what to believe, you're ready to believe just about anything.  Those poor gullible people... This is just sad.  #religion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GreatHindusthan @india4evr @URRao10 @ArminNavabi Is that the guy who, despite being atheist was given a full-on religious funeral?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GreatHindusthan @india4evr @URRao10 @ArminNavabi Agreed. That's why I would never say anything like that.  Good ppl do good things, bad ppl do bad things - with or without religion.  My only position on religion is that all religion is unfounded and ridiculous.  The harm of religion following this is only a matter of degree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParosTom #StarTrek hands down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GreatHindusthan @india4evr @URRao10 @ArminNavabi And that is why I don't think that the point you raised even appears to the others.  Some of the hateful comments here show very clearly that those who react strongest are the last to be concerned about how women are being seen or presented.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCReed40 But I do remember that Michelle Yeoh did her own stunt on the bike in this film. 😍<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StephenUzzell2 @CELESTRON1957 And rightly so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GodlessApeMan Wow...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Elishabenabuya Killing 70000 for counting and not killing the one who did the counting?  Sounds reasonable...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DearMrAtheist Almost? You have my attention.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bharatmaheshwar @URRao10 @ArminNavabi  https://t.co/ksFGXZAODe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrrobertrshaw ...belief that Yahweh was the only god to exist in reality. All of the other gods came to be seen as make-believe...  It's intriguing how this works. Every single time it blows my mind how one can clearly see the make believe in other gods but not their own. 🤯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Much2CrowedeD @Ironhorse76 Same? Okay.  https://t.co/RIj4ui3ws6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Much2CrowedeD 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HereticalArtist Sounds good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GreatHindusthan @india4evr @URRao10 @ArminNavabi Thank you! This is a point worth mentioning.  Now, I see no problem in drawing, or painting (I guess you can already see where this is going), people or fictional characters even in lascivious poses. Everyone sees art with their own eyes and interprets it differently.  Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bharatmaheshwar @URRao10 @ArminNavabi Sure, one is Mohammed, another is Isaiah and the others were already mentioned.  Now what? Is it now worth to get worked up over some scribbles on a bit of paper?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaarete1 @DiamondLynne1 @BenediktAmrhein 🤣😂 That could work!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaeDaeSupreme More pizza?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BoomManMike @arjun4123 @india4evr @URRao10 @ArminNavabi Nope.  Real people are not the same as characters in someone's favourite stories.  I really like StarTrek (not believing it to be real, of course - that would be ridiculous) and if you were to insult, say, Captain Janeway - I couldn't care less. 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What evil magic is this?!  Oh, it's just physics? Ah, that's fine then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Greeninthemiddl 😂🤣 Yeah, okay, I can see how that would lead to questions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Greeninthemiddl I don't understand... Why wouldn't you want to show the duck costume?  I think that would be great!  (you see, I tend to enjoy the odd little things in a meeting)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCReed40 No, I can't.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FFBAtheists @Zebusrugby @AliiRidge Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaxGigandet A number of people, yes. 3 in my immediate family. 2 friends.  I think that's plenty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arjun4123 @india4evr @URRao10 @ArminNavabi Glad to see that you realized how your argument didn't work.  Otherwise you wouldn't feel the need to try and get personal. 🤷‍♂️  Bye.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@india4evr @URRao10 @ArminNavabi BTW, I didn't even mention extremists. Was there a particular reason you want them mentioned?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arjun4123 @india4evr @URRao10 @ArminNavabi Missing the point but sure, let's see if we can get you to find the difference here.  Is shooting myself harmful? Yes. The reason why one shouldn't and/or wouldn't do that is clear.   Is drawing some character harmful? No. Any reasons why I shouldn't? No.  Get it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@india4evr @URRao10 @ArminNavabi Demean? Pointing at "having faith" is like pointing at the idea that 2+2=5. Prove my belief? Nope, it's pointing out where and how their belief is false. What did he do? Post a picture of an imaginary being... What's the problem?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@india4evr @URRao10 @ArminNavabi Because we are being told that we can't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vivavikk @URRao10 @ArminNavabi Tell that to the people who attacked Charlie Hebdo...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@URRao10 @ArminNavabi There you go. One of these is the prophet you requested, one is Kali and the other two are Mbombo and Xenu. You may now pick one of these to get offended by.  Sorry, btw, I'm no artist 🤷‍♂️  https://t.co/7wpMTvlx58<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tagesspiegel Bayern darf Kreuze aufhängen, Berlin darf Kopftücher erlauben. 🤷‍♂️  Jedes Sonderrecht für irgendeine Religion ist ein Schritt zurück.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArminNavabi Of course not, but they don't care about that.  They feel offended 🤷‍♂️  I'm sorry for all the crap they are hurling at your wife and your mom.  Not that I'm terribly surprised, though. They have nothing but emotions 🤦‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ZosKiaCultus666 @manchestermelly Yes, do! They are fun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zessshy @TonyJHopkinson @OceanKeltoi You can believe whatever you like, without evidence for it that believe just isn't valid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zessshy @TonyJHopkinson @OceanKeltoi Okay. Present evidence for polytheistic deities existing and I shall agree that it has validity. Until then: lack of evidence = lack of validity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScenarioLENS Because nobody offers them money to do it. Why? Because those who are in the mindset and rich enough to offer an assassin that kind of money are not interested in this situation to be changed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OceanKeltoi Then I would ask those atheist to present evidence for whatever polytheism they want to claim to be valid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zessshy @TonyJHopkinson @OceanKeltoi That's like saying A=B  But whatever 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NiggaAtheist Correct and that notion is why religion is dangerous even if their believers happen to not murder people at a certain point in time.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StdSucks This gives me a little hope for humanity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulg "I didn't know." and the all-time favourite "Yes, but..."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OccamsBattleaxe 🤣😂🤣😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EbonySkeptic I hear you. I don't think they forget, I think they like the idea.  To be fair, we have assholes and idiots too, but luckily they're the minority.  Oh, and nobody goes shopping with assault rifles!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EbonySkeptic It is. Yes. I have always had good times and have met nice people there. Although, if it should be the Netherlands my choice would be Utrecht - it's really pretty. And one could commute from there to Amsterdam easily.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EbonySkeptic I'll admit, they are received with caution. But those that I know have now decided to stay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EbonySkeptic Come here. We're not perfect by any means, but we'll be happy to have you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UdoGuengerich Das glaub ich dir.  Zumindest ging es nicht um WhatsApp-Gruppe Ja oder Nein 😉  Hab eine gute Nacht!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UdoGuengerich Bis Elf?! Wow... Wollte wirklich keiner Eltersprecher werden?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iam_ThePaulo  https://t.co/RfEuHGMxTE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Drstevenhobbs You rock!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRealQryzti And I'm still stuck in those days back then 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rayleengale Yep. And I know that you were directly talking about the article, so I will fully agree with you there.  It's just your description of the US that hasn't only been around since Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rayleengale You think this is just since Trump?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whomeverett You still have a bit of time, do not despair.  And, if it really gets too hard, just check out how much your neighbours have collected 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whomeverett About time, too!  You know the story about the ants and the grasshopper, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@godless_mom Hopefully it will come back tomorrow or soon, at least.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaeDaeSupreme Congrats on making another trip around the sun! May there be as many more as you like!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SoCalWoman @PAULUSV3 🤣😂🤣😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaraLee1221 Sounds like the right thing to say, yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PAULUSV3 #Cake. Having it and eating it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WOsrin The shit show continues. Oh, and whatever has happened so far will increase, for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Talija8189 Klingt gut! Ich hoffe alles klappt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DGehirnwurm Unbedingt #Norsemen, #TheBoys, #TheExpanse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wurzelspitze @DGehirnwurm Ich unterstütze diesen Vorschlag!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@the_nerd_skull @Ash_and_Cinder I wonder why it would be a pain in the ass to address people with the pronouns they prefer to be addressed with.  A simple reverse, calling him something he doesn't want would show her how messed up she is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@base_thai Big dreams, sadly didn't work out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoHolyScripture Nope. And that isn't because of the last few years. I wouldn't have voted for him back when he was a candidate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heimsittich Being complex doesn't exclude the rather good odds that this person is, in fact, stupid. Of course there's the possibility that they are just horrible people 🤷‍♂️  In short, judge away, as long as you base your judgements on proper reasons. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZosKiaCultus666 🤣😂🤣😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irolands Only, if those boy-toys would hide under a bucket those cougars would understand what to do... Hopefully.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stop_Trump20 I love the "manaze"!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stop_Trump20 True.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mak_nono I wouldn't need 12 minutes to finish this!  3 minutes, more likely!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiesbethEpunkt_ Ihr trefft euch?!  Wir machen sowas online.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder And dressed for the occasion, too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeonardSkywalk2 @Tachyon100 Oh, really? Since calendars for you are proof of gods you now may choose from many different calendars from all over the world. You're welcome!  https://t.co/mwnIdrbUYz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScepticalAussie And he's totally not mental, no... He's just religious. Nothing to worry about...  When was the last time an atheist burned their, let's say, left elbow?  You know, in memory of all the murdered atheists in the past.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SheriAWilkinson I have no reason to believe in a god.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aelurotheist Eifel...  Ich hab schon damals gesagt, dass man da besser nur drum herum fährt.  Nicht, dass man noch von einem Eifelpolizisten festgeholt wird 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tachyon100 😂🤣😂🤣 Depends how you do your job then. Assassin's-Creed-like or Nightmare-on-Elm-Street-like?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Und wieder dieses Unsinnige "Emotionen wegen Tegel"  Nein!  Es geht darum wie grauenhaft schlecht BER ist.   https://t.co/8u6OrWAz6b<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AApologetics And because every human being is biased, those who really seek truth are looking for evidence. Unless, of course, you seek "a truth" that confirms your bias, then apologetics are the way to go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaeDaeSupreme 🤣😂 He sounds smart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Floridaline  https://t.co/FkBK7Xzw9e<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZosKiaCultus666 He really doesn't, no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kb_Maniko Na logisch. Ich würde doch keine Kinder im Regen stehen lassen, nur weil sie noch an den Weihnachtsmann glauben.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BihariSlayer @Haqiqatjou Keep telling me what I believe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParosTom Did Robin Hood exist?  Meaning, No.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BihariSlayer @Haqiqatjou Are you saying that this is what I believe?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BihariSlayer @Haqiqatjou I don't?  Tell me more about what I believe and what I don't...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aelurotheist @DichJasmin Ach so? Also, ja, ich hab den Account schon das eine oder andere Mal gesehen, hab sogar mal drauf reagiert, glaube ich. Aber ob fake oder nicht hätte mich jetzt eher nicht interessiert 🤷‍♂️  Vielleicht wollen die nur eine Info "rauskitzeln" um sich als Kunden anzumelden... Idioten.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aelurotheist Jasmin ist fake?  Was ist das?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rak_strong I am pleading the 5th<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimEdwardsZero4 Fight and hide, alternately, depending on the situation.  Guess why even the toughest of the special forces still use camouflage 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CapturingChrist Yep, it's that look that says: Oh come on, we all know that it's bullshit, we just want to feel like we are special and are willing to lie about it, just so we don't need to face reality.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LEN_1977 Oh ja! Die Schlagzeilen möchte ich sehen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rak_strong Moving to Germany with wife and child to start a new life with pretty much nothing in our hands.  That was May 2009.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scepticdust Yards and lbs...  Doesn't sound like much. Because back in medieval times when these measurements were used people were easily impressed. As a castle was the biggest and a horse the fastest thing they knew. 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@godless_mom Easily out and outspoken, pretty much constantly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast So, is he one of the good cops?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@curixus1 You can always say that you come back the instant Jesus shows up.  That way they can believe you're waiting for him as much as they do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AntitheistCrsd Agreed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AntitheistCrsd Ah! Okay, I just burn them whenever I get my hands on one 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AntitheistCrsd What, or maybe who, did you do?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LarsWienand @JMuellerToewe Das sind doch auch alles solche Verschwörungstheoretiker, vielleicht sollte man ihnen erläutern, dass mit jeder Eingabe auch ihr Name mit eingetragen und gespeichert wird... #Covidioten<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@don_goodnight Hands down, Jackie Chan.  Skills AND the ability to not take himself too serious.  He's the one I would have loved to work with in my stunt days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Talija8189 Habe ich gefunden, brauche ich nachher aber selbst noch, muss noch die vierte Hauswand streichen...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hesanaughtyboy I don't think he existed.  And now I'm wondering how many Christians would understand that I didn't say that I think he didn't exist.  😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atheist_bad Oh how I liked Lea back then!  Her hair and everything! 😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marczimmermann (hab ihn gleich nochmal angeschmissen) 🙈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chels_Bough @2ndHandBookery This!  I learned to hate Mickey AND to get past that hate to total Zen. Mickey Mouse Clubhouse can't touch me anymore!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marczimmermann Feini!  Na dann, schön aufdrehen die Boxen! Speziell die letzten 5 Lieder... Insbesondere mein absoluter Favorit: Nothing Else Matters!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ardenking55 Reminds me: what would happen if everyone jumped at the same time?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zwillingsmami87 Tja dann hab ich leider keine Verbesserungsvorschläge 🤷‍♂️  Da musst du wohl durch, wie'n Lurch, wenn du'n Frosch werden willst.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joschasauer @ennolenze Wusstet ihr, dass #Pferde euch ständig den Mittelfinger zeigen?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zwillingsmami87 Das stimmt allerdings. Wenn, dann sind es immer die üblichen Verdächtigen.  Rufumleitung einstellen? So, dass sie immer beim Chef landet anstatt bei dir?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zwillingsmami87 Oh? Ist es diese eine Kollegin um die es schon'mal ging?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rak_strong An apple tree and some flower beds with a tall hedge between us and the outside.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickymillionerd Blödsinn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ballerina_KC Not really. No.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZosKiaCultus666 That doesn't sound good at all.  Take care of yourself and take your time. Remember the good times you shared.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Warren39503025 @canadiangirlbc1 @Perseus44604589 Morning! At the time you wrote we were deeply immersed in family life.  I'm now at work and Newton is guarding the house (so probably asleep).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OccamsBattleaxe Delusional, yes. I still am not convinced that they aren't.  Explanations regularly go to the need of some initial disease or some such cause of a delusion.  That cause is, for example, the indoctrination in childhood.  They have been made ill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Warren39503025 @canadiangirlbc1 @Perseus44604589 I shall.  Good night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Warren39503025 @canadiangirlbc1 @Perseus44604589 Okay... I hope he's better by now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Warren39503025 @canadiangirlbc1 @Perseus44604589 🤣😂 I had to look that up. Do these taste as bad as I imagine?  Courts, huh? At least they let you do twitter. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ForumAtheist Beethoven.  Just to see, after listening to modern music, how he would go berserk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheFigen Imagine this was real!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Warren39503025 @canadiangirlbc1 @Perseus44604589 I don't see how looking at photos leads to automatically judging people, but heh, you do you.  Now l'm interested - Why fig?  Guardian? Sounds serious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Snoozedanger Ach so... Na gut, dann seid ihr raus.  Aber welchen Lehrer mochtet ihr noch nie...?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Warren39503025 @canadiangirlbc1 @Perseus44604589 😂🤣😂🤣 Didn't you see my picture? Yes, like that. Nope, just a happy puppy. Frenchie/German Shepard. Newton. A fully intact boy. That's a pity. Since I don't know how old you are - can you get a dog now without asking anyone for permission?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsbeyondbelief "It’s a disappointing irony that the time in your life when you’re being formed the most is also the time when you have the greatest pressure to conform."  A profound insight.  You have earned my respect. For whatever that means to you 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeepStateShu I was expecting  🙌🙌👏🙌🙌👏🙌🙌👏🙌🙌👏  But now that I did it - who knows which song this is?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Snoozedanger Ha! Jetzt haben sie euch. Verpetzt du deinen Sohn oder sagst du es war das Internet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Warren39503025 @canadiangirlbc1 @Perseus44604589 Funny coincidence, I just took the dog for a walk.  But, maybe I can help, what confused you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Warren39503025 @canadiangirlbc1 @Perseus44604589 Nope. Whenever I needed saving it was always some other person.  Also, how would a character in a story save me?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Warren39503025 @canadiangirlbc1 @Perseus44604589 As real as Jesus.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Warren39503025 @canadiangirlbc1 @Perseus44604589 I don't see how that would help you but that could be one possible answer, yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Warren39503025 @canadiangirlbc1 @Perseus44604589 Or, just maybe, that idiotic tweet about churches and strip clubs showed up on my TL and I found it hilarious enough to comment.  Here's something to ponder: why did I ask you a question instead of just assuming stuff?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zephcourtney @pinata1138 @lukeisamazing That's a nice dress for the next goth party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Warren39503025 @canadiangirlbc1 @Perseus44604589 What dislike of others?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Warren39503025 @canadiangirlbc1 @Perseus44604589 What anger?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MGENBlog Und sowas ist Arzt... 🤦‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Warren39503025 @canadiangirlbc1 @Perseus44604589 🤣 You see, we both knew where this was going the moment I asked you and you realized what a dumb statement you made.  So, as #religiots do, rather than being honest you first make up some BS, making it worse, and then evade answering completely.  Jesus doesn't like dishonesty 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Warren39503025 @canadiangirlbc1 @Perseus44604589 Again, you're saying that prayer only works if a bunch of people are sitting in a room together? Because this collective consciousness somehow needs physical proximity of praying people?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QuareFellas @TeriLoveSkin @Stop_Trump20 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stop_Trump20 But of course! What else can one do to have an honest discussion about what's for dinner?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@canadiangirlbc1 So you can go to work without feeling guilty?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Warren39503025 @canadiangirlbc1 @Perseus44604589 So, what you're saying is that prayer only works when done in a church?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonsteingard Whose imaginary friend had the bigger dick?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PastorAlexLove Alright, I stopped at 55 seconds so essentially I didn't really watch the video...  Not all of it, you know?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gabrielalofki @Fightislamophob @amethystlyy @laneaaron10 Can't figure out the difference between skin colour and religion?  Ben Affleck much?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aelurotheist Geht gerade nicht, wir sprühen momentan über Deggendorf. Weil wir nämlich überraschend festgestellt haben, dass da tatsächlich noch Leute wohnen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Snoozedanger Na da darf doch der Kackel nicht fehlen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheFigen Okay, that's a tad bit better than my P900 😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shady825 Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@INTAtheist @mdnij34 Final answer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamzombywoof It magically appeared in your pants?  Hail Satan!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stop_Trump20 You guys are vegan, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@onyx0815 Oha, da hat er schon selbst eine klare Blockempfehlung rausgegeben. Fast schon schade, dass er uns bereits geblockt hat, sonst könnten wir das jetzt machen.  Was für ein Arsch...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Absurdism_R_Us @atheist_bad Just as with the world where ppl don't harm each other, this too would be great, yes.  Considering that I have no idea what reparations for murder would look like I would, depending on the motive for the murder, rather vote for incarceration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MurphyYuiko Yes.  I would even extend this to #astrology and/or #Homeopathy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doppeldaumen @Snoozedanger 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣  Der Kaiserschnitt wäre schon seit der Steinzeit Standardprozedur!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Absurdism_R_Us @atheist_bad Some interesting points there, after skipping all that spiritual stuff in the beginning.  One could argue that by putting murderers in prison for the rest of their lives is one way of making the community responsible for "atonement or reparation" to "avoid blood feuds"...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atheist_bad We would all love to live in a world where people don't hurt each other.  I wasn't flippant about the child being killed but about what a death sentence would change in regard to the child being dead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Absurdism_R_Us @atheist_bad As I would hope everyone would be.  We agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GretaThunberg Enjoy school!  Hopefully all you kids will stay safe and healthy.  Thank you for standing up to most of the world. We all need people like you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atheist_bad Yes, so?  By killing a killer the kid wakes up again?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Absurdism_R_Us @atheist_bad That's an argument, yes, but not a good one. Because it implies that if someone was really and absolutely certain to have convicted the real perpetrator it would then be okay to kill that person. Thus it's not an argument against the death penalty but for being really sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atheist_bad I'm not certain that the guy in the picture is really willing to have his mind changed.  If he wanted to really ponder the subject of death sentence then my answer to his question would simply be: Human rights.  Done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PepperMiss @DiamondLynne1 🤣😂 I was hoping for "... three holes in the ground." but yes, it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiamondLynne1 Well, well, well...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NHC_Atlantic Has anyone checked on the Veeries yet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCReed40 @whomeverett Sadly, I don't see the US changing anytime soon.  There has been so much of this, and other shit, that I do not hold any optimism for the US to get well.  The ideas and ideals that started it may have been great, but well, what can I say...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AtheistRepublic Translucent playing Jesus?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Brovahkiin89 In the beginning, yes. But once that organization outlives you, people will start fucking it up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnpavlovitz Appointments. The validity of saying you'll meet at that place at that time - and showing up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@onyx0815 Bin geblockt, hab keine Ahnung was los ist 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bikinatroll @markoftheD That would be the next button. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markoftheD I don't need to think about that.  That's a solid Yes.  It shouldn't be hard to achieve equality with something as trivial as skin tone, but since humanity seems to be too stupid to even get past that - give me that button and I press it. And I don't even like purple!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Elishabenabuya Well, to be fair, she did answer your question. 🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Fightislamophob @amethystlyy @laneaaron10 Ah, that of course makes it all better... 🤦‍♂️  Why do you #religiots not understand that by "explaining" such horrible ideas you keep making it worse?  Any sane person would say: "Shit, yeah, that's fucked up!"   You guys: "Well..."  And then play victim when called out on it!  https://t.co/IoVO5jVW8M<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DerHelgamops Ja, tut mir leid, ich hab erst nach dem Antworten gemerkt, dass der Tweet schon ein Jahr alt war 🙈  Aber, wie war denn die Hochzeit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@polidan_sharon Please say you aren't really surprised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder Echt?!  Auweia... Mein tiefstes Beileid!  Ich wusste ja, dass Pfadpfinder einen religiösen Hintergrund haben, aber sooo schlimm? Wow...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meckernfueralle Ein Wettrennen.  Ein Läufer, bereits mit einem riesigen Vorsprung, nahm sich die Zeit an einem Baum auszuruhen.  Mit einem Winken lief sein Rivale am ihm vorbei.  Wie das Rennen am Ende ausging erfahren Sie im nächsten Bild.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Angesichts der neuen #Corona Fälle, unter Anderen Schüler in #MVP, würde ich gerne erwähnen, dass #Berlin noch 2 Tage Zeit hat von den #schuloeffnungen #Abstand zu nehmen.  #Covid_19   Wir aber wohl nichts passieren bis das Kind wieder im Brunnen liegt...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RCMhere In my opinion it's a good thing to let them die peacefully.  So, no, you're not bad in my book.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ForumAtheist It's true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@R_Craig_Rapp There is solace in truly understanding this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrunTheBear @realDonaldTrump Humanity in general.  And I'm not even kidding. I'm edging more and more towards the opinion that humanity needs to go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZosKiaCultus666 I'm glad to see, though, that he started eating.  Looking forward to more updates now 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RiyalityTV @NorsemenO So much yes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZosKiaCultus666 Did you check it for fleas?  I remember that we had lots of fleas when I brought a hedgehog home as a kid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atheistic_1 Nope. That statement is spot on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChannelMaykin Nah Gin Jang!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ForumAtheist @CrispyCurry Pity, I can't see the initial tweet...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JENNontheRocks_ 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣  Kids are great!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whomeverett 🤣😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Prophet_of_Zod A big NO because it would be stupid to burn the book in order to suppress the idea.  To burn it for fun, however, I don't mind at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree fully.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whomeverett Interesting position. Is that because ads are so annoying or because they prey on the gullible?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mork_v Dragons!   Hands down, that has to be dragons. Can you imagine?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zwillingsmami87 So wird Bildung vorgegaukelt um zum Spielen zu animieren. Sonst ist es ja anders herum, ein paar Spielgeräte zum Anlocken und dann tausende von hochspannenden Infotafeln deren Inhalt eh keiner liest oder sich gar merkt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ForumAtheist Poonany and/or money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@godless_mom Infidel tits?  https://t.co/c1QNmwJ23O<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimEdwardsZero4 I showed them your tweet, saying you're going to pay for it, can you believe it, they laughed at me!  Why won't they believe?! After all, it is written. Right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanaSawan1 @Gabadabs @BrunTheBear @KugelerdRemake #TrumpVirus because he made it great again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Elishabenabuya @EmAitchJewlee Exactly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnthroBlogger Da hast du ja eine schöne Sammlung geschaffen. 🤣😂  Inzwischen bin ich nicht mehr schockiert, ich lache nur noch. 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CELESTRON1957 @ForumAtheist Your words into god's ear 😉<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SecularScarlet 100000?! Wow...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThatEricAlper Bloke's father and brother get killed. Blike travels Europe with his uncle. Bloke comes back home, marries the village beauty - she gets murdered. Bloke flips and starts a civil war. Bloke dies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OhComeOffIt @ThatEricAlper Not?  Man let's people work. People survive a war. Plot-twist: Man has to run away because he let people work without pay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdsBrown Brad Roberts  I'd love to sound like I don't want to sing and people like it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NuckChorris16 I'm sorry, I can't answer this without shaming anyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LAguja44 Ach SO "dort arbeiten"! Ich dachte dort arbeiten im Sinne von "für die Bibliothek arbeiten".  Ja, das ist was völlig Anderes. 🙈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LAguja44 Ich nicht mehr, die Benutzer waren enttäuschend.  Aber ich verstehe, daß du wieder was machen willst.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@politcaljann I do now...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@majwal7 @BaphometSatanas @YouTube I learned of their existence on Kho Tao, almost 20 years ago.  Ah those were the days...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenorCucho @kingschmunzel Das ist das #Astronautentraining der Raumfahrtorganisation von #Molwanien.  Ihr Ziel ist, nächstes Jahr zu #Geminga zu fliegen. Eine interne Quelle hat uns verraten, dass sie damit rechnen in weniger als 12 parsec dort anzukommen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zwillingsmami87 Urlaub - lohnt es sich?  Wir fragten 100 Eltern...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brilliant!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JWPanovec @PeterAden @captain_klintor @whosurdaddienow Not just in the US, but yeah, I don't understand the need for these switches either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@consequ @ichbinschoener Ich mag Trevor. Er ist immer wieder genau am Thema und vergisst dabei nicht, auch den einen oder anderen Witz.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@majwal7 @BaphometSatanas @YouTube Not bad!  I haven't heard Morcheeba for at least 12 years now...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCReed40 Fuck her feelings! It's not like she cared much about other people's feelings 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaeDaeSupreme Please do, yes.  Your mom's care sounds good, but meningitis is no joke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidsting414 Clean shot.  And a lot of good food for quite a number of people. The dogs, too, will have their fair share, I'm sure.  This isn't sport, it's hunting. It's not trophy hunting, either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveTiger999 @RevNFidel I'd love to share your optimism, but since the re-election of Bush and certainly with Trump becoming president, the US is not above voting for Ivanka.  Or worse...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drolkrad_ehT @Stop_Trump20 Nice!!! I wants it!  https://t.co/OUQ1Sp8OLY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Literally ALL #Trumpster #MAGAts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meine Stimmung, nahezu täglich.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RevNFidel Look at the US and tell me that there is no chance she will be.  I dare you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aelurotheist Rügen.  Dann muss man zwar die neue Brücke abreißen kann aber auf dem Dänholm eine Quarantänestation einrichten.  Es ist, als hätte ich da schon'mal was vorbereitet...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jfinn6511 That's quite true, the story is way more positive and I agree, normalizing bisexuality is important.  Doesn't change that I wouldn't react very nice or civil if I heard such a statement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jfinn6511 No, I never heard that and, frankly, I would be appalled to hear a gay person dismiss bisexuals this way.  Out of pure spite I would turn homophobe on them, if only to remind them what being dismissed this way means.  Damn this pissed me of! Apparently, that's a trigger for me 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HerrJesus1 @Michael10415865 @LizasWelt @dunjahayali Abgesehen davon, dass ich auf den Gedanken Kindern Religionsunterricht anzutun allergisch reagiere, das aber hier nicht das Thema ist - ich denke wir haben ausreichend gesehen, dass Schule diesen Leuten nichts gebracht hat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Michael10415865 @LizasWelt @dunjahayali Schrecklich, ich weiß. Das Schlimmste daran ist aber, dass es leider nicht so einfach erklärt ist. Wenn sie alle nur bildungsfern wären!  Gerade bei den #Seuchensympathisanten gibt es Viele, die sogar Unis von innen gesehen haben.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@keigh_see I like this one the most.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParosTom #Religiots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaritoneBxtch After chicken, a beer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizasWelt @dunjahayali Grauenhaft.  Und die sind alle hier zur Schule gegangen...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Elishabenabuya @PopuliAtheist I'm so sorry to hear that.  Trying something unknown, even if it is the best kind of food, at the worst possible place is just bound to be a bad experience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@curixus1 Every watch needs a watcher.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScruffyOldApe @cgp42 Esatto!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScruffyOldApe @cgp42 Sure. The interest is more a general one. Learned about him and his goals in school (you can imagine that Germany has a strong interest in teaching about that part of history).  Also, having heard too often the stupid argument that Hitler was such bad because he was an atheist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScruffyOldApe @cgp42 To get you started, if you want to look into it...    https://t.co/P7ctAMTf87<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScruffyOldApe @cgp42 Yep, that and his love for "providence".  Didn't quite work out for him, huh?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mhdksafa Africa.  Is the right answer. Right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OccamsBattleaxe I don't remember. When I watched Cocoon the world was still very big indeed. No internet connection worth mentioning. And cell phones?! Ha!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stop_Trump20 The Cacophonics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stop_Trump20 That's a pretty sword...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OccamsBattleaxe Nope<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atheist_bad And think about the challenges of eating those in one bite!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atheist_bad Does this place offer free cookies for dancing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some cool shit...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyoBerlin @ChaWiBiker @Tarnkappenrdlr @BerlinCyclist Auch das steht in der stvo, Absatz 2, dass man Abstände lassen soll.  Aber sich an die stvo halten oder gar auf den übrigen Verkehr Rücksicht nehmen?!   Ja, das wäre schlimm...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stop_Trump20 Moosen in the woodsen and many foxen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChaWiBiker @Tarnkappenrdlr @BerlinCyclist Natürlich nicht. Es heißt "zu zweit nebeneinander".  Das ist doch aber dem weltenrettenden Radfahrer egal. Hauptsache ist doch, den Verkehr zu "corken" um dann sagen zu können man würde bedrängt werden.  Denn es ist doch nur eine Radtour mit Gleichgesinnten 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chukey_D @DukeofOmnium Priorities 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aelurotheist Die guten alten #Seuchensympathisanten passen hier ebenso wie bei den antivaxx Idioten. Und, völlig überraschend, die laufen bei den Nazi-Pro-Corona-Demos auch mit.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_xXCornholioXx_ @ZosKiaCultus666 Agreed. We let Rando play with us for a few rounds. He lost 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sara_unholy Seeing happy people doing something they enjoy.  Children playing, teens showing off how "different" they are, people dressing or having their hair non-conforming...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thomaskaine5 Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilLowenthal1 Grammar from Yoda learned they have.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PastorAlexLove 😍 I'm loving it so much!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarriePurdom @ZosKiaCultus666 Also, thanks to you. The poop jokes would do the trick when my niece and nephew come around for a visit.  Sadly, they don't yet know any English and by the time they do, they're old enough to play the "normal" game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stop_Trump20 As ridiculous as it sounds, dishwasher. And as non-surprising as it is, I am not a millionaire (yet).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder @TJump_ I'll do that too!  Woo-hoo, I'm learning so much these days!  Recepticles, Popsicles and bicycles are now being pronounced like ancient Greek names and DNA-pasta is now a thing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WILLIBALDSCHMI1 @MGENBlog Insbesondere seine Anleitungen in Exodus 21 und Levitikus 25:39ff, gelle?  Toller Typ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZosKiaCultus666 I expected as much. What I didn't expect was how much my wife enjoyed it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Atheist_Trooper Nope. No such nutcase in our family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZosKiaCultus666 a while ago you mentioned Cards Against Humanity and I was intrigued. So I ordered it.  It arrived yesterday and we tried it immediately.  Fun for the whole family 😉  So, thanks for the great tip!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nordvvind Stimmt.  Ach... Das war 'ne Zeit...  Irgendwann pennen sie dann bis mittags, musst halt nur bis dahin durchhalten.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@snide_sally Y! Y! Y!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nordvvind Descartes und Dualismus... Aha...  Da müsste ich mich wohl erst mal reinlesen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guten Morgen aus #TXL  https://t.co/bubJ9HShLS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nordvvind Ich kann mir vorstellen wie die EU Grenzwerte als Wille Jehovas auch für Christen lustig sind.  1. und 3. sind recht schöne Fragen, damit kann man arbeiten. 2. würde ich wohl Punkt für Punkt abarbeiten und am Ende langweilig sein 4. Uiuiui... Dünnes Eis 🤣😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nordvvind Und was war die Erklärung? Wenn es denn kurz zu beantworten ist?  Und, abgesehen von der Frage nach dem Universum, was für Fragen haben sie noch gestellt?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stop_Trump20 Coffee!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nordvvind Und genau dieser letzte Punkt überrascht die Leichtgläubigen immer wieder aufs Neue. 🤷‍♂️  Immer wieder, es ist nicht der Mangel an Wissen von den Religionen, der die Menschen dazu bringt sich von Religionen abzuwenden!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@callmegoro Biting your tongue or the inside of your cheeks.  There's no better example for "intelligent design".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bergziege9 Ui...  "Haben Sie schon probiert Ihre Schulter mit Wucht gegen eine Wand zu rammen?"  Was im Film hilft muss ja auch in der Realität helfen, oder?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MGENBlog Komisch, dass keiner diese Arschlöcher in seinem Team haben will...  Und dumm nur, dass sie sich aller erdenklichen ideologischen Kontrollelemente bedient haben.  Leider, für Pfarrer*innen, ist Atheismus keine Ideologie. 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnthroBlogger Irgendwas mit Getreideähren, was hübsch ist und die Träumer anlockt?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FGramsel @kevin_ketzer Gewonnen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZosKiaCultus666 That too, yes.  Don't let twitter keep you up. 😉  Have a good "night" then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mork_v The Hi, but not for a long time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZosKiaCultus666 I believe that!  A good beer and a couple of episodes of Norsemen, maybe?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stop_Trump20 286 km, according to Google maps<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rak_strong 🤔  https://t.co/X9uIxQltxt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nordvvind Nicht unbedingt, habe ausreichend von meinen eigenen Leistungen im Bereich des Vorlesens gehört. Aber ich möchte dir unbedingt gratulieren zu deiner Buchauswahl.  Crivens!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZosKiaCultus666 Sounds like a hell of a night.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheFigen 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣😂🤣😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Stop_Trump20 Yep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stop_Trump20 I puked better...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ANDREW1ALBERTT So true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BadBradRSR This one.    https://t.co/DWIL7tYe82  Up until that time I had only heard of such assholes in far away places.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@zwillingsmami87 Na dann viel Spaß!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kallenje Ruhe, Sicherheit, Gesundheit, Geld, Bildung, Intelligenz, Freiheit, Essen, Freizeit, Platz... Insgesamt, ein tolles Leben.  Ja, ich gehe davon aus, dass es den meisten Menschen auf der Welt nicht so toll geht.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@justcallmequeer I can respect that.  Back in the days I, also 13, decided to not see that guy again while my little sister, then 10, wanted to meet him. He missed that chance as well, so an 11year old girl decided to make a cut, too.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@heimsittich Thank you, I was just about to check with friends of mine. This way we don't need to get into the subject and I don't have to be the cat from the original tweet. 🙀<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Elishabenabuya 🤯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@heimsittich That's interesting... Do they also explain how they arrived at that number?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder Whose cat, I wonder...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rak_strong We were 2 couples...  It was awkward AND afterwards we weren't couples anymore 🤷‍♂️  .   Luckily it went better another time. I guess it helped that there were no couples involved 😉<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Yang_WenIi @AzurLane_EN So, where are you going to put it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stuartblair @ForumAtheist Nice guess, but sadly: no.  This is but one line, different from the other lines in the city. What I was talking about is the public transportation in the entire country.  Here's an example.  https://t.co/QeK7NFDfo2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aelurotheist I see what you did there!  https://t.co/78dxaHRkvi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ForumAtheist Reserving seats on public transportation for people who aren't handicapped, old, pregnant or little children.  Also, even having the audacity to force women to vacate their seats so that one of those privileged people can sit on the seat next to it!  Like to guess which religion?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCReed40 @atheist_bad Thanks, but not being born in the US means, I don't need lotion 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@4TH31ST As she should be. 🤣😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@4TH31ST No, you're looking at it the wrong way. Imagine she hadn't fed the cat first!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@atheist_bad I enjoyed the people are awesome videos, but as YouTube goes, then EVERYONE called their vid that and it was mostly rubbish...  But I got to love a clip with this track in it:   https://t.co/Pygx3Mprg6<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JBrigic Versuchen wir es ganz simpel.  A=A und A=/=B Soweit noch verständlich?

<|startoftext|>@theadeniran I'd wonder what went wrong.  Did the health care system fail her? Was she in some kind of distress?  But luckily we lived in a place where the system took care of mothers AND there was no stigma in pregnancy or abortion.  Also, pro-choice does not mean pro-abortion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ForumAtheist 😂🤣😂🤣  Sources?  Not that it matters, but wouldn't it be hilarious if he'd actually written or said that somewhere?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rach_lois That's a ZERO for me...  Good!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder @rbdwarf I know the type.  Pretentious little fucks, trying to look "basic" or "spartan" as if it's not an insult to the rest of the world to look poor while everyone knows that you can afford to travel around the world.  And I was a #backpacker myself! Just not like that...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder @rbdwarf Oh please, go. Yes.  I will always suggest #Maninjau   https://t.co/qz3Md7KkOX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder @rbdwarf Wait, that reminds me of my trip through the Indonesian forest. Upon entering Indonesia, I had to take off my boots on my way through customs and the guys there were wide-eyed by the heavy sound of my boots their x-ray machine tray.  We traded stories about our jobs that day...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder @rbdwarf AND boots. Always...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder @rbdwarf Ah, those bloddy blood-suckers at night!  Yeah, there's a bunch of fellow life forms that convinced me of a separation of humans and animals!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder @rbdwarf Hence me ALWAYS wearing jeans. Even in my time in SE Asia for years.  Have people been looking at me funny? Yeah! Did I get slaughtered by insects? Barely. 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ffs_OMG I don't see the problem...  I never had any relationship with a person that insecure and I would not suggest anyone to have a relationship with such a person in general.  It's called projecting. You always expect others to do what you would do.  Jealous people are unfaithful. 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Renevelation Faithful before marriage?! 🤦‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mog7546 @cindyraecox_rae Excuse me for asking, as a non-native speaker, but isn't it #MartialLaw?  I may not have a clue, I understand, but this might just be one of those cases when the colonies brutally murder the English language...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ParosTom Never a true atheist?

<|startoftext|>@RCReed40 Oh no! Him too?  I liked him...  Well, there goes another one 🤷‍♂️  Seems like the older you get the more people end up on your shit-list.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mork_v Jim Jefferies. Certainly since just last night we watched his newest special.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@igorvolsky @GoyaFoods To get this straight - they're betting on the Titanic being unsinkable AFTER it struck the iceberg?  🤦‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParosTom Nope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@loquens35 Mag für #Religioten schwer zu verstehen sein, aber es soll Leute geben die lieber selbst entscheiden können ob sie oder ihre Kinder "gesegnet" werden.  Die Antwort auf die überflüssige Frage nach dem "Warum" ist also ganz einfach "Weil nicht deine AK!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Masken sind eigentlich nicht so schwer zu verstehen. Hier eine Gebrauchsanweisung für die, denen es trotzdem noch schwer fällt.  Gerne auch zum Ausdrucken für Geschäfte und Restaurants 😉  https://t.co/uu38kt3zOi<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@michaelcash100 Of course he is! He loves Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@godless_mom I wear it too.  Most people around here do as well. Might be one of the reasons Germany isn't hit so bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ennolenze War das nicht Bestandteil von Adlers Ausführungen zum Minderwertigkeitskomplex?  Dass das Herausheben seiner eigenen Unzulänglichkeiten?

<|startoftext|>@ennolenze Oh, so'n Ärger... Da wirst du wohl nicht bezahlen können. Schade.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DimitreusK @RCReed40 Ah! Yes, that I understand!  Like every horror movie ever - full of unintentional humour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DimitreusK @RCReed40 So, like what people say about Spaceballs?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alilovesstea Of the top of my head?  #Maninjau.  If you're as adventurous as I was, go from Port Dickson to Dumai by ferry and then cross-country to #Bukittinggi (crossing the equator on land 😉) and from there just a quick ride to the lakeside.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCReed40 @DimitreusK I'll suggest that as our infotainment for tonight. Not entirely sure if that will be accepted...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DimitreusK @RCReed40 Oh, I know of it and I do know that poster/picture.  I just don't think I've ever seen it. If I have it was so long ago and/or so bad that I don't recall.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DimitreusK @RCReed40 You already lost me at Jerry Springer. Sorry. I don't think I've ever seen Cobra.  So, we could agree on there always being some people who enjoy trash, just like there are some people who call a banana taped to a wall art. 🤷‍♂️  But to me: trash = not enjoyable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OllerQuestenman @go_Go_Rilla Ich hör nix...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DimitreusK @RCReed40 I don't want to dismiss this statement outright, though I'm highly skeptical of it...  Do you have an example?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCReed40 Right a german guy... Figures.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@go_Go_Rilla Ich kriege immer wieder Bluthochdruck wenn ich Artikel vor Namen höre oder lese.  "der XYZ", die Stefanie, der Paul... 😱  Und diese sprachliche Pest greift um sich!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@base_thai No! Not AirAsia!  Aarghh, the world is lost...!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, people, yes!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@andieverytime Who are these people?  Can I just donate the 50 bucks, to some music school?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irolands And I join you with my 50 for beer.  Seriously, who are these people?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atheistic_1 🤣😂🤣😂 As did I!  But seriously, what the fuck is wrong with people?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@janwameling Dann erhol' dich mal gut. Und du weißt, die nächsten 2 bis 3 Wochen kein Schmetterlingsschwimmen! 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@janwameling Heh, feini clavicula!  Sowas hab ich mir auch mal gegönnt...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RANobmann 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣  Da gehört schon was dazu eine Kreuzotter für einen Wurm zu halten. Respekt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bridget_joy_ As much as wishing on a "shooting star" or seeing some pattern of numbers.  Not at all.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dogintheearth Errrm... 41?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AtheistRepublic Most people in my immediate surroundings are atheist. Just a handful of theists and a few vaguely deistic folk.  That's a 90/10 estimated percentage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PumaBare Been there...  Stay strong, it'll pass.  And before you know it you've gained 5 kilos and don't miss smoking any more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mork_v I was almost there, but then got distracted by some boobies...   Such is life. 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marczimmermann Das kann ich stellvertretend für dich erledigen. Ich gehe mal davon aus, dass ich noch bis zum bitteren Ende in Tegel sein darf.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EbonySkeptic As creepy as it is to get mail from ppl you don't know, you can go ahead and ditch the book.  He starts from the assumption that #atheism claims the non-existence of god and thus is as unsupported as #theism.  #Agnosticism is therefore way...  Missed the topic, failed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eileen_awesome Danke sehr!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eileen_awesome Ich wurde um 5:22 geweckt. Von meiner eigenen Frau! Die liegt jetzt natürlich immernoch im Bett und pennt...  ABER hab ich die Bude angezündet? Nein. Ich hab den Hund dazu verdonnert mit mir durch den Wald zu latschen.  Was sind wir doch zivilisiert...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eileen_awesome  https://t.co/2Hk3DmtYW5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you're too lazy to go your own way, just let someone else tell you what to do. #Religion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeaglesResist To learn that he's an asshole?  I think I'm good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DGehirnwurm Solange du dich kritisch betrachten kannst brauchst du dir keine Sorgen zu machen, dass du dich überschätzt. Sich zu unterschätzen ist nur schlimm wenn es dich davon abhält dich zu entwickeln - was angesichts deiner letzten Klausur nicht der Fall zu sein scheint. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mork_v Inventing the warp drive.  That would be cool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder Enjoy it. You've earned it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IntegrityMatt13 @pinata1138 @pcbrynn She isn't no. Because hardly anyone voted for the green party.  I was hinting at house and senate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCReed40 Conspicuous lack of human in that picture, huh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IntegrityMatt13 @pinata1138 @pcbrynn So, the whole American government is just the president? Nothing and nobody else?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Juanmb23 @pinata1138 @pcbrynn I'd say they try to have real democracy.  Not just a choice between crap and shit, but a range of choices that reflect ones position most closely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IntegrityMatt13 @pinata1138 @pcbrynn And if all the Clinton voter had voted green they would have a much bigger presence. 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stop_Trump20 Waste water.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markmobility @s10blazer355 @WhiteHouse A nightmare for security, but yes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheoShantonas Perfect!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nordvvind 😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whomeverett @AshGamesAcct True... And from what I've seen in your pictures of food you would have to share and never have it for yourself. And we all know that sharing is only fun when you want to share. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Drstevenhobbs As long as it has the CE mark, not even Hellraiser will be dangerous anymore.  Don't you just love the health and safety measures?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ennolenze 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whomeverett @AshGamesAcct BUT the idea was to have it as a bowl/bong!  So then...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whomeverett @AshGamesAcct I guess it wouldn't hurt to make enough for two, right?  After all, I'd hate to make one, let my wife try (as one does) and then watch her finish it and I go to sleep hungry. Again... 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@INTAtheist Whenever the subject isn't a truth claim in a religious statement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whomeverett @AshGamesAcct Oh, you said the magic word...  Hot pot! I am SOOOOOO suggesting to have that this weekend.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RCReed40 🤣😂🤣😂 Agreed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@medburnbook Thought I could be useful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rbdwarf @tanja__eder Sounds like a solid plan!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mitchellvii That's because you're doing it wrong. People with your condition need plastic bags! Just check with Dr. Birx, she'll agree.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder See? And just like that the day gets better 😉<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Alexand78298828 @BurgerBenDecker @Afelia Natürlich nicht erst seit Amthor, aber im Großen und Ganzen hast du Recht.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder @rbdwarf Butt why not? Everything tastes better with butter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PastorAlexLove Now, don't you become an accuser of brethren, brother!  That seems to be a bad thing...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@atheist_bad As I know mine.  But, as I said, the numbers alone could also be used (and they are) by those who benefit from a racist system.  And, from your exchange with Martina Murray it seems some people really fall for that kind of propaganda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackIgwe @atheist_bad Because that is what the numbers are supposed to show anyway and when we take into account the system that is behind the numbers the answer is, obviously, racism.  The question however, was about the numbers alone. Sometimes numbers without context can paint a wrong picture.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JK_Riki @BrimstoneSmell Seeing as you can't even tell when you are pushing scotsmen, I'd say it doesn't matter one bit.  All you've done since tweet 1 is making baseless claims, bad arguments, moving goalposts, playing the victim, telling silly stories and, yes, dismissing seekers as not real seekers.  https://t.co/w1WF0PXZbJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JK_Riki @BrimstoneSmell Who cares how long you have studied it if you still don't get the idea of evidence being necessary in order to make a valid claim?  Shifting the goal posts, not facing the burden of proof, scotsmen, playing the victim...  Yes you did tell a story about your youth. So what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrimstoneSmell @JK_Riki He won't. I've asked him numerous times for evidence, he just dances around and tries to shift the burden of proof away from his claims.  And, of course, plays the victim as if his questions weren't being answered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JK_Riki @BrimstoneSmell 🤦‍♂️ New doesn't mean "this just in", it's a point not accounted for in your position.  That's exactly what the scotsmen is about - you sticking to your position, despite it being shown false by seekers who didn't come to your conclusion, by pretending that they didn't really seek.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zwillingsmami87  https://t.co/hVnS4ZP3jH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JK_Riki @BrimstoneSmell Alright. Wrong "new information" from my side.  Your point "seeking =finding"  My new info "believers you have found the opposite, seekers who didn't find"  You: not really seeking.  Better now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JK_Riki @BrimstoneSmell The new information was your added "they just didn't really seek"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrimstoneSmell @JK_Riki One addition: ...made in [ignorant] man's image...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JK_Riki @BrimstoneSmell Your position ignores all those who have held strong beliefs as well es those who did search and find the god hypothesis lacking merit.  So you rather claim :those who seek, find (scotsmen) those who didn't find just didn't truly seek (no true scotsmen)  Textbook example.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Elishabenabuya I'm guessing I know who it is because I remember the "religious atheists" tweet.  I looked to find who she was referring to and found that it was just another example of her overreacting.  I haven't yet unfollowed her, but I admit that the thought had crossed my mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JK_Riki @BrimstoneSmell And a truth claim!  Without evidence...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cestlavie87 The concept of heaven or an afterlife is so juvenile that it is easily explained as such to a child that age. Ours asked what we would think if she died. I said that we would remember all the good times we had with her and how proud we were of her.  Took a while, but she got it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cestlavie87 Oh yes, that was a longer talk, at about the same age.  One help to understand life necessarily ending is the party.  You show up, meet a lot of people and at some point you leave. It's no use to waste your time worrying about the end of the party, knowing it'll happen anyway.1/2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JK_Riki Okay, I'm bored now.  So if you have anything worthwhile to say you may 1. define your god and 2. provide evidence for it.  Unless you can do this, please know that you are spouting nothing but boring imaginary stories.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And there it is...  Surprised? Yeah, neither am I.    https://t.co/JD80LuPgsp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZeroIssueVoter @shawntheverbose @fixedintime @JK_Riki @P1neCreek Oh, it's myth alright. That it's more myth than holy books, or whatever point you're trying to make evades me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JK_Riki I was expecting this...  https://t.co/ljHqe5YvIY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZeroIssueVoter @shawntheverbose @fixedintime @JK_Riki @P1neCreek 1. Evidence of a negative? 2. Postulated by you. 3. Needs 2. to be supported. 4. Same as 3.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What will his answer be now? Something that involves scotsmen?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JK_Riki Can you hear yourself? Do you feel how condescending this statement is?  If not, at the very least it is obviously false. So many #ExChristian or #ExMuslim could tell you how they were seeking or had thought they had found god. I, too, asked you and you had nothing to offer...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZeroIssueVoter @shawntheverbose @fixedintime @JK_Riki @P1neCreek Yeah, okay. I don't know what you're getting at.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JK_Riki You already mentioned the seeking.  I did ask you about that but guess who didn't answer...    https://t.co/nbDWpec8uZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JK_Riki You wrote this ridiculous suggestion of "going to god" AFTER I already told you. Now you pretend I am not answering.  And to show you how that doesn't work I gave you the same suggestion back. You realized how dumb you sounded and are now trying to evade.  https://t.co/YIo91d2eZg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JK_Riki Of course it doesn't! That's what it was supposed to show you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZeroIssueVoter @shawntheverbose @fixedintime @JK_Riki @P1neCreek Okay. And?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JK_Riki YOU suggested that!  I then used your suggestion and swapped the god for some other ridiculous idea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JK_Riki I told you that's what you sound like.  I'm glad you see how pointless it is to suggest to go to something for which there is no evidence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZeroIssueVoter @shawntheverbose @fixedintime @JK_Riki @P1neCreek The discussion was lack of evidence.  You claimed there is evidence of nonexistence. Proof of a negative.  When asked for it, your position was: many people not believing it is evidence  Did I miss something?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JK_Riki Evidence for believers? There you go, that one comes all the time, without me seeking it.  They come and tell me stuff wherever I go.  But gods seem to be unable to do that. 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JK_Riki You didn't cover anything.  Go to god?  Here, try this: You want to have evidence for leprechauns? Go to them. It's provided.  That is what you sound like.  See how gods are the exact same thing as leprechauns and how it's not a question of categories?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JK_Riki Yep. This is why I keep asking for evidence. Yet not one believer has ever been able to provide any.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JK_Riki You were the one to mention the "declaring it doesn't exist" and now you don't know what "it" means?  Do you want to back up to where you wanted to talk about categories but when I asked about your definition you changed the subject?    https://t.co/TTYCbvitRu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder @RCReed40 😊 Having worked for years in bars and a cocktail bar, too, seems to have left a mark...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JK_Riki Really? Is it that hard for you to imagine that "in" is supposed to be an "it"?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JK_Riki Let's get one thing straight here: I never declared in doesn't exist.  Personal experience? Cute. Do you have evidence?  Seek? Thus implying that those who don't believe just didn't want to believe or just didn't seek?!  Ever wondered why only believers see ghosts?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCReed40 It would be a cocktail WITH a sandwich on the side and it would be called: True Fucking Love<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JK_Riki Ah, finally an answer to the question of categories. Moving the goalposts so far that what remains is some vague deist idea of "god".  What you didn't realize here is that no matter what "category" you want to put your god in - it still is just a story without any evidence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZeroIssueVoter @shawntheverbose @fixedintime @JK_Riki @P1neCreek Just one Google search and there they are...  And I can't say I'm surprised. After all, people will believe anything if it only makes them feel special. 🤷‍♂️   https://t.co/xkXRE38oax<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZeroIssueVoter @shawntheverbose @fixedintime @JK_Riki @P1neCreek Not to your knowledge - what?  That people actually believed in Leprechauns or fairies? Just like people believed in Jupiter, Zeus, Odin or Svetovid (to use one of my locals)?  I'm fairly certain that if you were to look around you'd find people STILL believing in them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JK_Riki So I have to ask you again: What different categories are those?  And on the subject of "unsubstantiated" - until ANYONE can provide ANY evidence of them being real for ANY of the stories about thousands of different gods, they are just that, stories.  No evidence = fiction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheFigen Shit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nipperdawg @bevdevwarrior Those are good steps in the right direction!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JK_Riki @ZeroIssueVoter @shawntheverbose @fixedintime @P1neCreek Depends which categories you're trying to apply.  Are your categories "a real god" vs "fairytale"?  Then it would be, yes. But the category here is "fictional characters" and why anyone would believe them to be real.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZeroIssueVoter @shawntheverbose @fixedintime @JK_Riki @P1neCreek So do leprechaun stories. They're just not being told anymore as if they were true. Same thing goes for the old religions - just because virtually nobody believes them anymore, doesn't mean they didn't claim to be real.  And even if - how is many ppl not believing it evidence?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JK_Riki @ZeroIssueVoter @shawntheverbose @fixedintime @P1neCreek Explain how the comparison is bad.  Both are stories adults tell their children in order to teach them certain ideas. Neither of them have ever been observed to be real. Nobody in their right mind would believe them to be real.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZeroIssueVoter @shawntheverbose @fixedintime @JK_Riki @P1neCreek They aren't anymore, no. But, okay...  Now take your argument and apply it to every holy book out there.  Because, essentially, you just explained that many people not believing something to be real, is evidence for it not being real.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZeroIssueVoter @shawntheverbose @fixedintime @JK_Riki @P1neCreek You do?! Please, no kidding, please present it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@atheist_in_nc @RCReed40 The funniest part of this gif is that I don't know where it starts!  Does it start with "No" and go to "Well..."?   Or the other way round?  Both hilarious, but VERY different!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RCReed40 I had to look up who that is and immediately got the answer to your question: You are in need of some angry sex.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zangetsuto @Ayaan No, you're defending the statement that the US is "the best place".  A statement so dumb that only a Trumpster or a really US-biased ignorant would defend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zangetsuto @Ayaan And yet more whataboutism.  You must be a Trumpster...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Eine, in den letzten 3 Bildern deutlich gestellte, recht interessante Frage.  Wie würde man selbst es sehen?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joschasauer @Bergziege9 Ohne Expertise kann ich nur eine Meinung anbieten:  Niemand kann es jemals Allen recht machen.  Überempfindlichkeiten sollten dich nicht davon abhalten zu zeichnen was du lustig findest.  Wenn jemanden Diversität stört 🤷‍♂️  Wenn jemand meint du zielst nur auf eine Gruppe 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZosKiaCultus666 And that's a good thing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mork_v Summer.  For years I never needed to worry about what to wear, but here in the temperate climate zone...  For example: different kinds of jackets?!  I still don't wear a jacket unless it's REALLY cold.  Luckily my body is very resilient to any kind of weather.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zangetsuto @Ayaan Utopia? If it was, one might consider it "the best" but since that is out, that's a no.  Pointing at worse place also doesn't make it the best.  Would you like to try pointing at places where the issues I mentioned are non-issues? No?  I wonder why...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DWPippy Sure, sounds about christian to me.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sart26409389 @Zaunkoenig75 @onyx0815 Da hab ich auch ein "tolles" Beispiel für welches mir immer Dialekt als Entschuldigung angeboten wurde obwohl es nur falsch ist!

<|startoftext|>@Joernroeschen @onyx0815 Leider sieht der Duden es ebenso. Nur, dass die das dann "umgangssprachlich" nennen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@onyx0815 Ich hab's auch nie verstanden. Es ist doch wirklich nicht kompliziert.  Eine andere grauenhafte Unart ist "wegen dem". Deswegen könnte ich jedes mal im Strahl kotzen!  Oder heißt es vielleicht demwegen?!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tatentschluss @KonHaubner Der Zusammenfassung kann ich nur zustimmen. "Falsch aufgefasst" ist hier, was mir wichtig erscheint.  Damit ist nämlich nicht der Punkt am Ende falsch, sondern die Auffassung/Einstellung der Leute.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KonHaubner @tatentschluss Nicht ernst nehmen, wäre eine Vermutung, ja. Ich würde dazu noch Faulheit oder einfach fehlende Fähigkeiten als Grund anbringen.  Alles keine schönen Eigenschaften.  Nein, ich kommuniziere lieber mit Menschen die sich auszudrücken verstehen.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nnkp_grey Nope. Either they think anecdotes are evidence or they just don't care about evidence at all because they have faith 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Elishabenabuya I have no problem with that.  What struck me, though, is: writing from right to left while calculating left to right.  That would confuse me endlessly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NateConCarne Agreed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@donca4millo @onyx0815 I'm Gott/Satan Szenario ändert das nichts daran, dass, wenn Satan es verhindern kann, er mächtiger ist als Gott.

<|startoftext|>@OhComeOffIt @ForumAtheist 🤣 Can't have both ways, you know?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@antitheistdude @BrockFacts @Ayaan So, maybe the US is better than the country she fled - which might be possible.  But she didn't say that, did she?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZosKiaCultus666 I thought it quite easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Easy  System of a Down Marilyn Manson Smashing Pumpkins<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelTheJust So it's like ghosts and demons who, for some reason, can only be witnessed by people who believe in them.  If it was factual it would not need someone to believe in it before understanding it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atheist_bad And, of course, a patriot...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ForumAtheist @OhComeOffIt Exactly. No chicken yet. Just an egg.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ForumAtheist @OhComeOffIt Exactly. There is that shell, instantly. There is no chicken yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ForumAtheist @OhComeOffIt Who cares about humans?  The question was egg or chicken.  And the egg is there before the chicken.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ForumAtheist @OhComeOffIt Every animal is a product of its parents.  The egg, not just the egg cell bit the hard shelled egg, is there before the embryo develops into a chicken.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ForumAtheist @OhComeOffIt Good, we both know what an embryo is. But having confirmed that an embryo isn't a chicken, you have to agree, that the egg is first.  Oh, this is fun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LO0NARECLIPSE Just showed your tweet and the pictures to my daughter.  She was wondering what your problem is...  Amd then she remembered - this sounds like the US, where skin seems to be bad, while violence is cool.  Kids only have problems with skin when they are taught to have them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KellyScaletta @douknowurmegan And not just swastikas, as if that weren't bad enough, the Reichskriegsflagge of the Nazis!  That is the one flag the allies saw when they were fighting!  Fucking Nazis...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ForumAtheist So, you agree that the egg, to protect the embryo, is there before the embryo developed far enough to be a chicken?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder Sounds good. I hope it works out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ForumAtheist @OhComeOffIt Ah! But is an embryo a chicken?!  Careful with your answer now...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ForumAtheist So the egg was first, you say?  Because whatever was there before "the chicken" was "a chicken" wasn't one but did lay an egg, out of which came "the chicken".  And eggs were there in that line loooong before any bird arrived that later would evolve into chicken.  Right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrinceOfAtheism The moment anyone says that the US is best at anything but spending money on the military, they've already lost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ayaan Oh please...  No paid leave for pregnant #women and young #families? Thousands of people being shot dead per year? #Healthcare that makes you chose between food or the doctor? Rampant #religion and #nationalism? Voting for some #citizens only?  But the US is best... 🤦‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCReed40 I am so, so sorry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mork_v Luckily I'm not an angry drunk or such.  I get jolly or, rarely, in the worst case nostalgic and emotional.  And there still are stories being told about me in nothing but my undies and my big boots... 😜<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@iam_ThePaulo @atheist_bad Sorry, no. It was just a conversation I happened to have with someone. I didn't even think of filming it.  But in very short:  Laws are based on ten comms - killing, stealing...  Amd what are the other comms?  Errm...   Right, no relation to us living together. Laws are humanist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atheist_bad I had another real life chance to explain that the our laws are not based on the 10 commandments.  A fruitful conversation, too. It was a good day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Elishabenabuya I'd call that sneaky 😉<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PastorAlexLove Cheap booze, dinner and his girlfriend holding his toothbrush...  Brother Chad needs to pray harder to succeed in life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Littlefish_5 Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pastormontmc I'd be like  https://t.co/UJtxG3OePs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@allesgeschizzl So viele Hände hab ich leider nicht wie ich sie jetzt hochhalten möchte.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OccamsBattleaxe That's why checks and balances is the idea - and a good idea it is, too.  Sadly it's vulnerable in the plutochratic US.  And with just to parties playing a game of passing a ball back and forth (yes, they play the same game) it's bound to happen that the idea is sold out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZosKiaCultus666 Fu-h-uck!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump CHEECH &amp; CHONG!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZosKiaCultus666 Yep. This bugger will keep us busy for quite some time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZosKiaCultus666 That still is the interesting question there, huh? Immunity, reinfection...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustSimon13 @_gottlob_ Exactly how it became #Christian, then.  Okay, what else is new?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stop_Trump20 And I was answer 666!  https://t.co/akMyk3UXkn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stop_Trump20 Can't say for legal reasons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCReed40 I love the haka! 😍 Having been lucky enough to witness it in person once, it is a really empowering thing to behold.  It makes you wish you were with them, ready to face whoever stands against them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dax_x98 No. Categorically No.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yastreblyansky @chuck4219 Then all is well and I am sorry to not have picked up on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WakingLifeDream I like Asimo. It's pretty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InspiringU2 Operate!  Open sesame!  Work, goddammit!  I really don't know what people like about these things...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OccamsBattleaxe Holding officers accountable would be a nice start.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yastreblyansky @chuck4219 Then the same question to you.  Would you be willing to be someone's slave under these laws?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zen232 Very good. Thank you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LFaraday You're right. It's time.  Good night to you too.  https://t.co/BJAyDMej7q<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZosKiaCultus666 But... Why?!  Was it the Town Musicians of Bremen? In need of a different set of voices?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OliviaC14337638  https://t.co/BGnd0nmnG4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OliviaC14337638 No, I mean you're not being honest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OliviaC14337638 While making rules for how to do slavery properly?  No need for omission, it's right there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OliviaC14337638 See? Liar.  Not one word there condemning slavery. Instead many different times telling slaves to obey their masters...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fras99 Ask him if he'd like to stay longer.  We've got food and drink and he's absolutely welcome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OliviaC14337638 That you're a liar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WolfTheRed A very beautiful hammer!  I hope it will become a cherished possession to be passed through generations in your family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OliviaC14337638 I posted that exact line and you pretend like I hadn't read it.  On purpose?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OliviaC14337638 Doesn't say that slavery is wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OliviaC14337638 Doesn't say that slavery is wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pontifex_de Der heilige Geist ist doch der, der in eurer Lieblingsgeschichte Maria vergewaltigt hat um mit ihr den Halbgott Jesus zu zeugen.  Den soll ich brauchen?! Oder dessen Licht?  Das ist doch ekelhaft! Danke, nein!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder Right, vacation...  Yeah, wouldn't that be something!  Did you already have an idea or even plans?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OliviaC14337638 And again: it literally lists the lack of punishment for beating slaves, provided they don't die.  AND the mere idea that a person can own a person isn't only not pointed out as a horrible situation, it is given as a reason for the beating to be okay.  That's messed up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OliviaC14337638 I know it was the norm, that doesn't make it better.  But thanks for making every atheist's point on this matter.  If you understand that this book was stating rules in a barbaric world - why on earth would any person want this book to be a basis of rules now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crashatarea51 @AracelyCannon @RCReed40 It was a video of some pop singer with a sledge hammer and a wrecking ball.  I never remember their names, sorry. 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OliviaC14337638 If they are not to be avenged, as in executed, it means that it is okay for them to do so!  If it wasn't okay, they'd be punished. As they are when they beat their slaves to death. Which is written right there in front of the part where it's okay to beat them if it's not lethal!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder I hope you'll get through this soon so that you can have enough time on the job to enjoy the job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OliviaC14337638 It also says that the SLAVE IS THEIR PROPERTY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OliviaC14337638 It say BUT THEY ARE NOT TO BE PUNISHED  https://t.co/4CX4XoFe6K<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlueVotr @realDonaldTrump #DroneWars #KillList #DispositionMatrix  What? Just because I despise Trump doesn't mean that I have to be a fan of the US before Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember how they sometimes want to pretend that human rights are founded in #Christianity?  When you think owning slaves is okay and beating them not too badly (as long as they don't die from it) is a human right, you might be a #Christian. 🤦‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OliviaC14337638 @GuardianAtheist What part of "but they are not to be punished" are you missing here?  Or is that on purpose?  It's not me failing to read the bible, it's your problem that anyone CAN read the bible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OliviaC14337638 @GuardianAtheist Human rights?! Are you high?  It literally says that it is okay to 1. beat someone senseless as long as they recover after two days with the "reason" that 2. this other human is their PROPERTY!!  https://t.co/TbMg7RX2vE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @DineshDSouza Oh please, as if you read!  And just because it has @DineshDSouza on it I will HIGHLY DOUBT that this book is any good, let alone great.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder See? The future is better!  Okay, okay, I'll see myself out...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crashatarea51 @RCReed40 What would you call that then?  The switch slap?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Genau! Und deswegen ist er jetzt in das Land gezogen, dass gerade den Austritt aus der EU gewählt hat.  Feini! Vom sprichwörtlichen Regen in die Traufe.  Naja, vielleicht kann er da ja mehr Kohle abfassen. 🤷‍♂️   https://t.co/g6wpKfEqII<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EverydayisCK @Sweet3Mango Oh, I thought I had mentioned it's the singers... Sorry. Yeah, well, not really a fan but I do appreciate Pongsit (Karabao not so much) and I remember a few things from back in the days. 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EverydayisCK @Sweet3Mango So it is as in the song, yes. But I'm guessing the term inspired the song, not the other way around, huh?  And, damn, that's a PORTION!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EverydayisCK @Sweet3Mango Or that, yes!  Proper noodles and in the background of the picture the plastic seasoning holders! 😍  Jabkang - as in Pongsit and Karabao?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@godFreeWorld Shocking, huh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Elishabenabuya It's a beautiful idea!  Although I must admit the idea of a "shoe holder" is new to me, too. 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EbonySkeptic Oh, I'm so with you. And as you said, the anger is understood but some people...  Just wow!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EbonySkeptic Wow...  My initial thought was: those must be some white people trying to incite ever more hate.  But then I remembered: humans! There's a whole lot of them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnonNewz All of it! But you don't have anything, do you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThkGodImAtheist Oh dear...  But, what a cool name is Boss Mustapha?  Anywhere you go you can say: "I'm Boss in here!"  Then a lady comes up to you and says: "And I'm Queen, sit down!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@valeriesmith344 Not a bad idea... 🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Youthresist @LFaraday @MoldyWarp @ForumAtheist Then say that.  All the other stuff was you, projecting.  I have yet to meet an atheist who worships science, let alone scientists.

<|startoftext|>@Youthresist @LFaraday @MoldyWarp @ForumAtheist 1. Your intentions show. Nobody worships science. 2. Only science deniers ignore scientists. 3. Again, it doesn't matter how credentialed a scientist is in his field because when they say something on a matter that isn't their field it is just another opinion.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ParentsDome Isn't that what Americans keep telling each other?  That they're all "Americans"?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Youthresist @LFaraday @MoldyWarp @ForumAtheist As in, that has always been the lie the religious have put forth.  Or do you try to claim that atheists have been treated and represented fairly?  To this day believers are being taught that atheists "hate god" or "can't be moral" without god.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Youthresist @LFaraday @MoldyWarp @ForumAtheist Even if that was the case, how does "historically meant" have any relevance?  "Being a Christian" historically meant "to be a good person", it still is being used as such today, despite being complete and utter bullshit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mann_mit_el @ebonyplusirony Oh verdammt...  Bitte, bitte, lass es einen #Afder sein, den eh keiner ernst nimmt.  Aber schön, dass er sich das Profil angeschaut hat ohne etwas zu begreifen 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairlessChimp Yep, the old knives...  They're old enough to have been used by some person trying to invent the wheel, but the blades are strong enough to have been forged somewhere in mount doom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairlessChimp @ConfidenceCult Right?!  What the hell?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was today years old when I learned this!  Mom! Why the fuck didn't you teach me this?!?! Oohh, learn how to fry an egg... Oohh, learn how to clean an oven...  WHAT?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairlessChimp I see we have equal taste in old fashioned knifes?  Yep, I too, just slide those fuckers open at the top.  Life's too short to find a pretty way to open those things.  https://t.co/kpxoX4AEy6<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@calvinzbest1 You just gained a follower.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@James32161788 I wouldn't say that climate change started the virus - that'd be too far fetched.  But the same reasons we have for climate change are the same that drive wild animals into closer and closer contact with humanity and, since we just toss animals together, we make things worse.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PicsByDJ @Loahnuh Thank you. I was just going to say this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deadlynitshade @katiey_KE I like your stance, however, I already use my time for my family 🤷‍♂️  Otherwise tacos would be ON!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BenAaronFIynn @katiey_KE Dude, blaming others for your obsession?  If you think that body image is sooooo important - grow some responsibility for yourself.  Besides, you look fine, stop whining.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amcc3112 @katiey_KE Because meh...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Diebluma @katiey_KE Way too serious for this thread, but yes, you're correct.  I have met Karen in person (and yes, I am aware that it's a broad term) and they found my bemused interest quite funny.

<|startoftext|>@AnthroBlogger Also stell ich mir das gerade vor wie dem Glaube entkommene Eltern, die ihre Kinder weiterhin taufen und die Kirche besuchen lassen um die familiäre Situation nicht zu belasten, weil die Großeltern sonst freidrehen.  Das ist bitter.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AnthroBlogger Wie bekloppt kann man sein?!  Aber, in mir brodelt gerade eine Frage. Wie kommst du an solche Mails? Gibt es in den Reihen der Waldorfeltern Leute, die es trotz ihrer Realitätsnähe in die Schule geschafft haben?  Und, nicht wichtig: "mischen sich mit esoterische[n] Positionen" 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Bill_Tuer_ Nein! Ich find's ganz toll! Ist doch ein hübsches Foto. Stell dir mal vor, sowas auf einer ganzen Wand!  Sorry, bin noch im Einrichtungsmodus 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PastorAlexLove If that doesn't convince those atheists, I don't know what will!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouGarza86 Definitely A!  I'll be sad for a moment to not have Ferris explain the world to me, but then I will forget it all while watching Die Hard and Breakfast Club. And when my wife gets home we can watch Shawshank.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AtheistsRead You're kidding, right?  Besides the benefits of purposely setting aside time to relax (or meditation, as some call it) and the idea of being nice to each other (doesn't every group claim this as theirs?) what is there in Buddhism that would merit joining the club?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BundesverbandH Der einzige Vorteil hierbei ist, dass es bei internationalen Reisen kein Problem ist, #Homöopathika im Gepäck zu haben.

<|startoftext|>@Youthresist @LFaraday @MoldyWarp @ForumAtheist Oh, yes, I did read the article. It's not surprising, as right in the beginning he talks about "agnostic" and then goes on to atheists claiming that there is no god, which is wrong. And thus, by missing the point, he comes to his wrong conclusion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Youthresist @LFaraday @MoldyWarp @ForumAtheist But he wasn't talking about science, was he?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Youthresist @LFaraday @MoldyWarp @ForumAtheist Wait, didn't you do this first? By presenting a scientist who has an opinion on faith?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Youthresist @LFaraday @MoldyWarp @ForumAtheist Argument of authority... Lame.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Youthresist @LFaraday @MoldyWarp @ForumAtheist So what? He obviously has the same problem every theist has: a different standard for religion (or spirituality) than for anything else in his life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoldyWarp @ForumAtheist @LFaraday Oh great, another "agnostic"...  Atheism doesn't mean "believing that there is no god" it means "not believing that there is a god"  How difficult can this be?!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AtheistsInKenya Not that I believe the story, but clearly, this is one of the things that actually aren't improbable at all.  If he had one each day it wouldn't even take him 3 years to say: Wait, didn't I already have you?!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ai_Zeek_Will @Horusosiris1 Except for the "fact" that this Jesus ever existed, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder It's perfectly fine, even socially, to decline an invitation.  It's not like God invited you to a party. Now that dude doesn't take no for an answer! 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@laumilumpf No, that's not what it means at all.  If the punishment for say, parking in a bus stop, was death penalty, you'd make sure to check were you park. Murder, on the other hand, isn't something one does on an average day...  If you're going to murder someone no "deterrent" works.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@laumilumpf Okay... I understand and to a certain extent agree, but what drives my uncertainty in this respect is that the idea of a deterrent reminds me of that same reasoning for the death penalty while it never deterred anyone. As in: "For 20 years I do it, for death I don't."  https://t.co/muxRWfyXAB<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tollekarte_ Ah! Ja, das klingt plausibel.  Naja, bis man sich dran erinnert wozu und wem er es dann wirklich verkaufen will...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bergziege9 Die Idee, dass Bild bei der Diskussion weg zu lassen ist ebenso falsch.  Erzählen kann man viel, dert Beweis dazu ist wichtig.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KonHaubner Eben Letzteres hat mich dann doch vom Doppelsystem vs Planet/Mond überzeugt.

<|startoftext|>Okay, no rush. After waiting for half an hour one parent showed up. So, even if these feathers are of a woodpecker, at least one parent is left to feed them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just passed by the nest again and saw these nearby.  Is there anyone well versed in #ornithology to venture a guess if these are from a #woodpecker?  If so, would you suggest we take the little ones or just leave them to die?  https://t.co/W7YC7ipws3<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AtheistRepublic The very first may really have tried to make up stories to explain the world around them, they just didn't know better. They were revered by a whole lot of delusional people who now were ready to be exploited by the conmen.  And that happened very early on, I'm sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Brink_Thinker Two happy kids. Nicely done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PastorAlexLove And the bird is nice, too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZosKiaCultus666 That's very good to know. I'm glad you guys are okay.  Let's see when they get me, huh?  I'm still working all through this time, as is my wife, and it hasn't hit us yet. But now that our daughter has to go back to school... 🤷‍♂️  Fingers crossed.  But, I'm glad you're doing well.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mork_v Gotcha, and as I said, I agree. It's just that I'd be less willing to be understanding in the latter cases.  Time for a coffee, then?  In fact, I shall make one RIGHT NOW!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HEiDi2607 Jaaaa! Jetzt, wo du's sagst!  Oh, war das Kacke!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mork_v I agree, that feeling would be very real and warranted.  Bringing up the idea of health care is a different matter, imo, because in that case he's lying, using you, to gain a benefit.  Loving another woman? As in, married to you only until citizenship and then gets her to come?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnpavlovitz @LindaHaleRCSD Hehe! Yes, sir!  Proudly so!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mork_v Depends... Coming out isn't easy and lying to one's spouse about such a deep issue seems to be a problem that has been present even before the relationship began.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stop_Trump20 It's called The Handle  So you can hold onto it when you're throwing her out of the shop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HinemanBobbie Oh please, call the police!  PLEASE!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@alluvialred @TaraHar31695702 @HealthMentor1 You're deflecting.  I didn't just say No, I said you have no evidence.  And instead of proving me wrong by providing any you chose to make more shit up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alluvialred @TaraHar31695702 @HealthMentor1 Still making shit up. In this case even lying.  Show me where I said anything like  - personal experience being true evidence  or  - scepticism means saying No.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alluvialred @TaraHar31695702 @HealthMentor1 Nope, you didn't get it.  A sceptic doesn't need to experience it because a sceptic understands that personal experience doesn't mean anything.  A sceptic needs evidence.  But you have none, so you constantly have to make shit up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hebammenmann 🤣😂🤣😂👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alluvialred @TaraHar31695702 @HealthMentor1 Cute story. As mentioned before, you'd have to show that it was more than a delusion if you wanted me to take it seriously.

<|startoftext|>@alluvialred @TaraHar31695702 @HealthMentor1 Your belief in any kind of divine connection is based on such a connection existing in the first place. Until you have evidence for it, you're "constructing" stuff out of nothing, remember?  You're making shit up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alluvialred @TaraHar31695702 @HealthMentor1 Your personal experience may feel very important to you but they could just as well be delusions.  I don't know what happened, if anything at all happened, so until they are verified they are just stories.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TaraHar31695702 That's the problem with blanket statements or compartmentalzing. The first is obvious, right? The second is tricky: It means to have a certain standard for certain issues, but in other matters one does not. Such selective appliance of standard leads to biased thinking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaraHar31695702 @alluvialred @HealthMentor1 I agree, disagreement is no reason to be unkind.  But to value all opinions, I'm sorry, no way in the world!   Some people, for example, are of the opinion that women are second class.  Value that shit? Not even sorry: No!<|endoftext|>

Trouble is, what you construct is mere imagination, not one piece of evidence for anything.  NDEs and OBEs are stories, found in every culture and religion. So, f'ing what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@loy_dominik @annewill 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂 Der war gut!  Als ob beten so wäre wie Etwas für Andere tun!  😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alluvialred @TaraHar31695702 @HealthMentor1 Medieval people didn't believe the world to be flat, they believed in the geocentric model. BIG difference.  Focusing on reality instead of wishful thinking is illogical?  Yet YOU want to tell people about a blocked view?  Oh, the #irony.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alluvialred @TaraHar31695702 @HealthMentor1 "higher"  Be more vague!  Something tells me you're not suggesting to take chemistry at the local university...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaraHar31695702 @HealthMentor1 Okay, cool.  I don't get why the bible should have any importance in teaching spirituality but that's personal choice, I guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fras99 Ocean's 8  And, no, I don't think so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaraHar31695702 @HealthMentor1 May I ask if you belief in good and evil as acting entities or are they just actions which we then judge to be either good or evil?  Also, when considering good and evil, why so bent on the bible? Aesops fables, for example, teach a lot about ethics and morals, too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaraHar31695702 @HealthMentor1 Rather easy. The mere existence of a molecule isn't evidence of or for the existence of a supernatural entity. If it was, you could just as easily pick ANY molecule, say H2O, and infer any type of divine being.  As in: If you know about H2O, how can you deny the existence of Ra?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Talija8189 Nein kann man nicht.  Und ich denke wer stark genug ist sich dazu durchzuringen sich jemand Anderem gegenüber zu öffnen, schafft es auch aufzustehen, Krone gerade zu rücken und die nächsten Tage oder Wochen mit Feenstaub zu pudern.  Übrigens:   https://t.co/MLNuaTplEW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaraHar31695702 @HealthMentor1 Yes. Tell her the #devil story is just a story. Invented to scare little #children into submission.  Also, tell her you're sorry you burdened her with this story and promise her that from now on you will only tell her the #truth.  Because, in the end, reality is her best chance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HairlessChimp @gunsnrosesgirl3 It's a stereotypical name for an old-guy's dog.  Waldi, would be the short version.  https://t.co/aoFMSBGpLm<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@zwillingsmami87 Viele schwierige Fragen, die du dir da selbst stellst... Und weitreichende Auswirkungen, dabei. Mein Senf? Wer fragt bekommt auch eine ehrliche Antwort.

<|startoftext|>@aelurotheist @AnthroBlogger 🤣😂🤣😂  Würde ich, glaube ich, sogar Geld für ausgeben.  Der Witz des Tages, mal anders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Einen fröhlichen #TagDerBefreiung wünsche ich Euch!  Nicht nur, dass die Nazis verloren haben. Nein! Sie haben bedingungslos kapituliert!  #FCKNZS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>A while ago I posted #DanceMonkey as covered by @LeoMoracchioli - because I did enjoy the version so much more than the original.  And here I found one that is just as pleasant.  Second Team and Tasya Bintang  Enjoy!  #music   https://t.co/xDz5teV7Og<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DiamondLynne1 That's punny!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eddieamo81 More like I don't give a shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AtheistRepublic Good boy!  It's wasted food anyway.  And back home everyone used the red Fanta because nobody wanted to drink that stuff!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@onyx0815 @TRIGEMA Das hat China besser hinbekommen. Dort ist es nicht erlaubt Masken teurer zu verkaufen. Aber, da wären wir wieder beim Kapitalismus...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mamisimonemami Komisch. Als ich meine Waschmaschine zu verschenken eingestellt habe hatte ich keine Zeit danach noch einen Tweet abzusetzen. Ernsthaft, keine Minute und es ging los.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@onyx0815 Da fällt mir jetzt ehrlich gesagt kein gutes Argument dagegen ein. Für die allgemeine Bevölkerung und deren Fähigkeit sich an Sicherheitsmaßnahmen zu halten zu sprechen fände ich naiv.  Okay. Überzeugt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blueheartedly Me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnthroBlogger Nein, aber seit er damals zu einem Dreh 5 Stunden zu spät erschien und nicht einen Hauch von Schuld empfand ist er in meinem Buch eh nach unten gerutscht.  Franka Potente und Gong Li waren übrigens pünktlich...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Von_Mongoose @irolands I'd agree with you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@eddieamo81 Because he was able to throw the discus.  Ability is key.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiamondLynne1 They love to share, don't they?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eddieamo81 What? 🤣😂🤣😂  Even when you try to be insulting you fail.  Let me guess - back in school, when kids talked shit, you never were able to come up with something. So you learned you could only stand behind the bullies and say "Yeah!" to whatever they blurted at others.  Poor kid.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's a bit like bringing a knife to a gun fight...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AtheistsInKenya None. 1. The are not interested in truth 2. They don't have a method, anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealAssTalkNow 🤔  Yes. If you explain the chemistry involved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sehr schön erklärt.  Bin zwar selbst kein Pinkist, aber Gleichbehandlung hat Verfassungsrang!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZosKiaCultus666 For what it's worth at least nobody wanted to drag to the executioner. 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZosKiaCultus666 @seanwhiter @GasmaNZ This is a great article!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shepherd_trish They talked to him?!  That's it? I assume he was sober at the time so they had no reason to hold him, or what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZosKiaCultus666 @DanWeeksMusic Wait... Do I need to go back to the scrabble thread?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZosKiaCultus666 Take it from me, yes you are. The meaner the better.  Have you had a disagreement with the humor police on that subject?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EverydayisCK @rak_strong @faranghappy @base_thai @RdmTHbotEng The German language did help me with a couple of the vowels, though.  Namely อ ึ and อ ื as german already has the "Umlaute" ö and ü.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EverydayisCK @rak_strong @faranghappy @base_thai @RdmTHbotEng Actually, no. 😀 I never understood why people find ง so difficult. There are tons of -ng sounds in English. Even "eNGlish" itself has it! ก vs ข is easy it's g vs k. More interesting are ข ฃ ค ฅ ฆ all k. In reading, okay, they are k. In writing - which one to use when?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CasarezKk Well, since you asked...  https://t.co/EQebrYTvn1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mork_v 🤣😂  Not quite that small, no.  It's just a hut we stumbled upon on another walk.  A few of days ago we even saw a couple of ravens! Not just crows, ravens!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shepherd_trish @mork_v Thank you, yes, we're very proud of our little pretty boy. 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mork_v Yep, a month ago. We bought an old little house out in the woods, just at the edge of Berlin. It's a minute walk and I disappear into the forest - which is why I do it every day. Newton loves it, too.  https://t.co/1VlBNsjGK2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ballerina_KC @StarTrek @drerinmac @TheKateMulgrew Oh, yes! One of my all time favourites!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mork_v Living room or kitchen - I haven't yet settled in enough to have made that decision.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@markoftheD I think I did okay...  https://t.co/8kZaLOJ825<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RCReed40 And? What was that final word?  Allgood?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@onyx0815 Ich stimme dir zu. Zum ersten würde ich empfehlen Lockerungen mit strikter Maskenpflicht und empfindlichen Strafen bei Missachtung.  Der zweite Teil: Tja, Kapitalismus. Sozial musste der Westen nur sein solange man als Beispiel dienen wollte. Seitdem sind die Handschuhe ab.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stodius1 But, as evolution goes, it can only work with what is there, never start from scratch but tweak it a bit at a time.  Makes sense, in a way, that some baggage from before is still present.  You know as humans still have appendices , blind spots or backaches from walking upright.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stop_Trump20 Anything for a green card.  A.N.Y.T.H.I.N.G!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaelschweitz @ron_humphrey Yeah, the first few days were okay. But then I started feeling cold (I never did before), but you started now, in summer... Smart.  I wish you all the best.  I still have almost 4 weeks to go - it's getting harder every day, but I stick to it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rak_strong The Thai word for snow.  Mispronounced it's so much better!  You may double check on the subject with some of my friends @EverydayisCK, @faranghappy, @base_thai or @RdmTHbotEng  Have fun! 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankAlexanderK @heuteshow Ohhh, fühlt sich da ein kleiner Nazi auf den Schlips getreten?  Magst du auch nicht, dass der Tag der Befreiung gefeiert wird weil die Nazis da verloren haben?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__Helicon__ If anyone has any questions on the subject - I'd like to offer:  https://t.co/Ba6wQcJljw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZosKiaCultus666 Surprise!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@godless_mom Yes, wholeheartedly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juttazerres @onyx0815 Schön... gesagt!!! 😉<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder Thank you 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder Sorry I just went ahead and jumped right in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder My wife who had "fun" with me pointing out various hang-up in Thai (specially with tones equalling meaning, even opposite meanings!) has tremendous "fun" with the German language, mostly with grammar, yes.  But German also has tones=meaning.  umfAhren =/= Umfahren<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tanja__eder It's important to point out, to non-german speakers, that the difference between "your" and "her" in this case is the "I" vs an "I"  Ihr - You/Your ihr - her/their  Yes, German can be quite fun 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shepherd_trish Oh, damn, this sounds serious.  I'm sorry to hear this. And I believe he will hold that against you as a betrayal but, hoping an outside perspective can help, I do think you did the right thing.  Yes, cops and jails are no fun in this situation, but what's the alternative?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shepherd_trish @rak_strong Woah! You scallywag, you! 🤣  But I agree, even if only because they left you hanging, you were the one caught, so officially it's yours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rak_strong A car. Or two. Well, three.  Okay, okay... Four.  But it was all over 20 years ago!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@godless_mom I, a dad, like this! 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Plexomatic I would love to agree, but then it would hit my family members and that would suck more than almost empty milk cartons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ResistQueen @bevdevwarrior That's a pity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CapturingChrist So you take comfort in the assumption that others are just as wrong as you are?  Curious.  https://t.co/ORl0CCrJlI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaptHowdy00 @GasmaNZ @ZosKiaCultus666 A place that rents out floor sanding machines.  Quite useful if you ever need it, but I don't imagine they get a lot of walk in customers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Brad_Couper @GasmaNZ And you do not want to buy the machinery for the job?  Here's your solution!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GasmaNZ @irolands You know it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cbridger954 @GasmaNZ 🤣😂  Naja, fast. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CapturingChrist @paulogia0 You especially should pay close attention to this part of the link you posted.  https://t.co/FeXdUQzAns<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DLFNachrichten Wer diesen Tag als "Tag der Niederlage" beschreibt zeigt auf welcher Seite er steht.  Ich sehe diesen Tag als Tag des Sieges.  Warum nochmal ist der 8. Mai in der BRD kein regulärer Feiertag?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Talija8189 Na dann, auf geht's!  Es klingt ja schon so, als hätte auch er Interesse. Kann also so schlimm nicht sein.  Ich drücke dir (und damit euch) alle Daumen die ich heute finden kann.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pinata1138 What's...  Okay, I'll sign off now. It's too late.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pinata1138 Nah, it's okay. It's almost 2 am here, she's already asleep again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pinata1138 Man, what wrong with my phone?!  It's!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pinata1138 Agreed, it hilarious. Sadly I laughed too loud and now my wife is awake and looks at me like I did something wrong...  https://t.co/VVdkk1pWDW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frl_kaffeetante @Talija8189 @triangelsolo Oder so. Ja.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Talija8189 Hi. So als Kerl gesagt: Zeichen sind was für romantische Filme. Gerade wenn ihr euch immer nur beiläufig seht, stehen seine Chancen deine Gedanken zu lesen eher schlecht.  Direktes Fragen kostet nichts und Geheimhaltung ist ja offensichtlich auch kein Thema mehr.  Viel Glück! 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@godFreeWorld Oh, another tough question!  Damn!  https://t.co/AMLkpPONDD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@godFreeWorld Uiuiui... That's a toughie!  Can I call someone?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaydlyn123 Shit! Where can I sign up?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandalRauser Then I don't see the problem.  You asked about religion vs science. I answered the question with gods "having a will". Religious without gods, too, believe in a "higher will".  The difference of either to science is still the same.  Unless your "religion" wasn't clearly defined.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandalRauser If I answer broadly termed tweets about religion vs science, until I get more than 280 characters, believers of the various concepts out there just have to live with the idea that to me they are just as silly as "those people who believe in gods".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandalRauser Ah, so you want to pretend that religions without gods somehow are more reasonable and should therefore be considered differently? To such a believer the universe, too, has a will.  When someone commits atrocities in the name of a "metaphysical postulate", let me know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandalRauser So?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandalRauser The difference is simple:  God(s) want this or that, and this is why believers are told to do it.  Science doesn't want a thing, it doesn't have a will.  Science doesn't work for/on ethics, ethics should keep science in check.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davestewart4444 @TJMair @RandalRauser Was that in the name of science?  Or rather in the name of some ableist, elitist, ethnic, racial or even a esthetic ideology?  Science only provided a technology. Using bow and arrow against people who use sticks could then be called killing in the name of science.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PastorAlexLove Something to remember you, then. That's nice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chigooner @Drstevenhobbs I fully agree with you. My way of showing my appreciation has always been to the person in front of me, though. Telling them how thankful I am for what they did for me, or letting them know how impressed I was with what they are capable of doing. But asking for the manager? 🤯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Justme10000000 I should be in Sweden in about a month. I should go see SOAD in about a month. I should have a housewarming party since about a month...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TonyJHopkinson @HisHolyLord My answer! Oh well, you got here 8 hours before me. 🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dass #Seuchensympathisanten sich für Widerstandskämpfer halten ist keine Überraschung.

<|startoftext|>@AnthroBlogger Ist doch alles schlüssig erklärt... 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mork_v 5:25 - that's when the sun rose here this morning.  Or in general - sunrise sounds fair.<|endoftext|>
