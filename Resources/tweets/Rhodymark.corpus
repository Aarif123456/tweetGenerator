<|startoftext|>@Notgnnatakeit @j_schottstaedt @GoodBlock11 @danielstar4101 @AOC You are infantile to try and label a vote as meaning either two things.  Did you poll all 74,000,000 people who voted for Trump and narrow it down to those two categories?  Are you butt-hurt that Trump is POTUS or just infantile?  FYI Those are my two labels for your actions.  😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrshulman @TomiLahren He is challenging the results IN COURT.   It is 100% legal to do so and he has the RIGHT to do so under our Constitution.  That isn't subverting anything.  And his term doesn't end until January 20th so he shouldn't leave before then anyway.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pseudonym789 @unreceived @GoodBlock11 @danielstar4101 @AOC I never indicated there was a direct correlation with hard work and wealth/success.

<|startoftext|>@j_schottstaedt @GoodBlock11 @danielstar4101 @AOC No, the pandemic has only killed less than 2 million people worldwide over the last year.

<|startoftext|>@HMergatroid @danielstar4101 @AOC Don'ts: Don't waste time and money.  Cable tv and streaming services do both of those.  Avoid drugs, smoking, alcohol (or keep to a minimum).  Exercise both body and mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HMergatroid @danielstar4101 @AOC Habits?  Sure.  Do's: Find job.  Work at job. If you want higher paying job, seek the higher paying job.  Do what is required to obtain the higher paying job.  Save any extra money while working.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoodBlock11 @danielstar4101 @AOC You are totally right.

<|startoftext|>@AgnusLiverpool @TomiLahren You gather incorrectly.  I don't use idiotic terms like "privileged" so I have no examples to give.  It's a false narrative.

<|startoftext|>@TheLegendOfLame The different levels of governments are all operate independently of each other.  The big reasons the Federal government is so important is that federal laws Trump state and local laws but most importantly the federal government has all that taxpayer money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheLegendOfLame There isn't one government.  Local, state and federal governments.  One of those is in the name of the country.😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheLegendOfLame It is a good system.  It ensures that every state has a say.  United States of America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheLegendOfLame Ohio citizens don't vote on senators (legislative branch) that represent Texas.  Vermont citizens don't vote on congressmen that represent Hawaii.  Each STATE's citizens vote on who that STATE wants to represents them.  It's not a difficult concept to grasp.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheLegendOfLame This way, each STATE has a say as to whom they want to represent them in the executive branch.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkyeShark @GoldyHA @DNC @GOP I'm talking to you.  It has to do with everything. Cops, teachers, doctors and anyone else with a pulse will try to exploit the system under the guise that their service is important.  You only seem to care about cops doing it.  But #CommonSense says it's human nature.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyeShark @GoldyHA @DNC @GOP Police forces are NECESSARY.  Please refer to my errant tweet about the #CultureOfVoilence in this country.   Whites, blacks, Hispanic, everyone.   Unless people start to behave, we need cops.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyeShark @GoldyHA @DNC @GOP I've been saying the same thing for decades about teachers.  Not the duopoly part but I do blame both parties. They spend money like drunken sailors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyeShark @GoldyHA @DNC @GOP Yeah.  That's nice but Democrats control the narrative in Seattle as well as the state.  The GOP does not.  Democrats have control of many cities where police activity is under scrutiny.  Why blame the GOP?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkyeShark @GoldyHA Yeah, strike that.  Thought it was another conversation.  In rebuttal to your last post:  Seattle, Washington is a Democrat Utopia.  Local and state officials are Democrats up and down.  Unions?  Might as well be declared a fundraising group for the @DNC.  Don't blame the @GOP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyeShark @GoldyHA And I will assume no one is going to address the #CultureOfVoilence that is embraced by the black community as part of the problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyeShark @GoldyHA Hmmm.  And why are the salaries so high?  Keep electing Democrats and their union buddies and expect costs to continue to rise.  They will literally fuck the city and State out of every cent possible while delivering crappy service.  At least now they are trying to break it up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoldyHA They quoted the high Seattle business taxes as one of the reasons for the sale.  Might want to look into that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LuisaMa54950308 @IvankaTrump Probably because it was an accidental death.  But I keep forgetting that a black woman's death is a chance for some to push their bullshit #Racism #SystemicRacism, #socialjustice and #inequality narratives.  Especially in an election year.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@clydetwopointoh @JeriLRyan Deaths per million is a more accurate measurement as it accounts for the deaths versus the population of the country.  The USA has 330 million people.  And 7,200 die EVERY DAY in the USA (census bureau) before #coronavirus even started.  Again.  Get a Clue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clydetwopointoh @JeriLRyan Brazil, Belgium, Peru all have higher deaths per million.  Go to WorldoMeter and check the daily graphs on India and Mexico.  And those of off the top of my head.  Get a fucking clue.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JimHandley21 @KboogieNdhoodie It's close enough to accurate.  She chose the life of hanging out with dope dealers.  She sure as fuck enjoyed the lifestyle.  Reap what you sow.  The same consequences that apply to everyone else, apply to black women.  At the most, all this was a mistake by the cops.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimHandley21 @KboogieNdhoodie The reason the cops were there IN THE FIRST PLACE was because of her boyfriend and his drug dealing.  If she didn't know he was a dope dealer, she is an idiot.  If she did know, then she is complicit in in own death.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KboogieNdhoodie Her boyfriend shot at cops.  The cops shot back.  She chose to hang around with someone who shoots at cops.  Sucks she got aired out but that happens in the world of drugs.  Bystanders die.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@clydetwopointoh @JeriLRyan If you look at deaths per million, then you would be EDUCATED to the fact that Brazil, Belgium and Peru all have a higher death rates than the USA.  And in Europe, we are starting to see cases pick up again.  #TDS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clydetwopointoh @JeriLRyan Do Brazil, Mexico and India also have leaders that lied to people?  What about Belgium and Peru?  I bet their leader's lying really helped spread the #coronavirus .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@shantra85 @SuperMotoRXGT @Joemckinleyfl @TheRightMelissa And that's a beautiful thing.  I really do wish you the best.  But I have to go to bed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shantra85 @SuperMotoRXGT @Joemckinleyfl @TheRightMelissa Everyone gets screwed on interest rates.  How would they even know your race unless they ask?  And a lot of what happens in those other encounters REALLY depends on your actions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shantra85 @SuperMotoRXGT @Joemckinleyfl @TheRightMelissa Well, in a few decades your race will still not be in the majority.  And in America, the majority will be of hispanic descent.  Not white.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shantra85 @SuperMotoRXGT @Joemckinleyfl @TheRightMelissa I get that.  Nobody (at least me) is telling you how to feel about anything.  But that was their times-this is yours.  Your life today is based on the actions of you in this time and the people alive in this time.  And I'll flip that.  Should black people tell whites how to feel?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neiltyson I am hoping we will have moved by then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuperMotoRXGT @shantra85 @Joemckinleyfl @TheRightMelissa Then by all means, please enlighten me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shantra85 @SuperMotoRXGT @Joemckinleyfl @TheRightMelissa Well, with all due respect by your own admission, it's not in your life everyday.  And I'm pretty sure most people would be in the same boat.  Unless they are looking for it especially when it isn't there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuperMotoRXGT @shantra85 @Joemckinleyfl @TheRightMelissa I live it too.  And based on what you have told me, a few "Nigger" comments out of a lifetime is hardly a reason to throw a tantrum.  Think about all the hurt put on you and where it comes from.  Odds are most comes from YOUR OWN RACE.  Which can be said about anybody.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuperMotoRXGT @shantra85 @Joemckinleyfl @TheRightMelissa No, I'm not saying that at all.  What I am saying is that is the George Floyds that get all the attention and based on the sole fact he was black and the officers were not, it is PORTRAYED AS evidence of racism.  Without any evidence to support that lone act was based on race.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shantra85 @SuperMotoRXGT @Joemckinleyfl @TheRightMelissa Right.  The majority of you encounters with ALL people are probably pleasant if you are a pleasant person (like me).  YES, there will be racist people out there.  I'm not saying there isn't or how you should act towards it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shantra85 @Joemckinleyfl @TheRightMelissa Well, injustices with pay happen to EVERYONE.  I have gotten the shaft many times.  And there are a lot of variables in that one.  You'd have to show more proof it was racially motivated (I'm not saying it wasn't).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shantra85 @Joemckinleyfl @TheRightMelissa How long ago was that one?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shantra85 @Joemckinleyfl @TheRightMelissa That's two.  I'd be curious to hear your response to that man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shantra85 @Joemckinleyfl @TheRightMelissa That's one.  Next.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shantra85 @SuperMotoRXGT @Joemckinleyfl @TheRightMelissa You have examples you want to share with the class?  And for comparison, you have examples of interactions with other races that were pleasant?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shantra85 @Joemckinleyfl @TheRightMelissa How many times you get called a nigger?  Daily?  Weekly?  By who?  And what were you doing at the time?  And do you remember your interactions with other races that went well?  Is that more or less?  And no, I'm not assuming you won't act uncivilized because of your race.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuperMotoRXGT @shantra85 @Joemckinleyfl @TheRightMelissa Well, that's where you are WRONG.  It's not A LOT OF THE TIME.  It is a small amount of the time.  You only focus on the times it does happen.  And you only hear about the times when people THINK it happens (IE: George Floyd).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRightMelissa The odds are 9 in 10,000,000 not 1 in 10,000,000.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JerryOrbe @Tony__Heller @cmclymer @NFL Good question.  Assuming money is no object:  How do you stop racial inequality?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shantra85 @Joemckinleyfl @TheRightMelissa That's the problem.  You assume you are judged by amount of melanin.  Odds are, you are judged by how you act.  Act civilized and you will probably be treated in a civilized manner.  And if you are treated unfairly, don't instantly assume it was because of race.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BuckyBuck2001 @CommonDomin8tor 6:  Have also been living rent-free on Native American land for 400+ years.

<|startoftext|>@richardfoote @TIME Oh, and that 95% survival rate is being conservative.  That's the straight up number of closed cases with an outcome.  Obviously, #coronavirus cases that aren't reported and the person recovers would make that number higher.<|endoftext|>

All statistical information from the FBI show this.  But if I point this out I am a racist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMarv6 @RealJamesWoods I'm sure there are.  If only there were a way to EDUCATE people on how to interact with #LawEnforcement. Especially for people that have been arrested several times.  You'd think they would know the procedure by now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMarv6 @RealJamesWoods Cops told him to stop.  He didn't stop and reached into the car.  #CommonSense tells me to STOP when a police officer tells me to stop.  But that's just me.  I won't get on TV but I get to stay alive and retain the use of my legs.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChumaguiNob @agirlgirl17 @cobreysr @ananavarro By that logic, you cannot teach civility to the black population either.

<|startoftext|>@cw21dlr1 @MyWord115 @2nd_To_None @ChidiNwatu @IvankaTrump @GM Half agree.  Obama certainly has money in the market so his wealth IS somewhat affected by fluctuations.  And yes, he and Michelle worked hard to get ahead.  I also am well off.  Should I thank all the Presidents going back to Reagan or attribute my success to my own efforts?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coronakiller69 @Schmaniel @MikeMason830 @AOC Yes.  and In some areas, the Democrats are in complete control.  Dems are representing the area on all levels: Aldermen, councils, mayors, state senators, federal senators/representatives all the way up to governor.  Plus, the services (cops, teachers) are run by unions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cw21dlr1 @2nd_To_None @ChidiNwatu @IvankaTrump @GM Lucky?  Yea, maybe to some degree I am.  I'll concede that.  But I also worked (somewhat) hard, lived within my means by spending the money I made wisely.  Saved/invested the rest.  Took care of myself and those around me.  Call that "Lucky" if it makes you happy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MyWord115 @cw21dlr1 @2nd_To_None @ChidiNwatu @IvankaTrump @GM I think you are confusing an outcome (financial well being) with privilege.  I'm Curious about something though.  Would you say that Obama is "privileged"?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@T38395139 No, sweetie.  It is not yet the norm.  The norm is people getting along.  The exception are situations like this (if it wasn't staged).  Just like a black man being killed by police is the exception, yet it is showcased as the norm when it happens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohstKelly @2nd_To_None @ChidiNwatu @IvankaTrump @GM You left out the "Kids in cages".  Rookie mistake and in an election year at that.  Sad.  Very sad.  #TDS  https://t.co/QmWiqlEuu4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Schmaniel @MikeMason830 @AOC You haven't cited one statistic.  I cited there are about 10,000,000 arrests every year.  I'm not lost, nor scared.  I'm at my computer about to go to bed in my (somewhat) nice house.  I appreciate your pity but I am okay.   You will need that pity if Trump wins I suspect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Schmaniel @MikeMason830 @AOC Actually, I try to go by the scientific method.  I hear all this talk of this #GeorgeFloyd guy died because of #racism or this #SystemicRacism thing.  I don't see it.  Show me what leads you to believe there is.  That's all I ask.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Schmaniel @MikeMason830 @AOC Do I have to give up all my things to join this cult?  That would suck.  I don't remember saying #racism was a hoax though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Schmaniel @MikeMason830 @AOC There are about 10,000,000 arrests in the USA every year.  So I would say that that OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THEM occur without incident.  Black or white or any other race.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Schmaniel @MikeMason830 @AOC I don't know who you think the enemy is.  But you are one up on me because I didn't know I had one.  Corporations and the media want profit.  Tell me something I don't know.  Media showcases black people murdered ONLY when a non-black is the suspect to fan #racism flames.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Schmaniel @MikeMason830 @AOC Ive seen the video and he was not cooperating.  Police gave him every chance to cooperate.  I agree they went too far but there is nothing showing their actions were based on #racism.  What did you see in the video to indicate racism?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Schmaniel @MikeMason830 @AOC Im not saying you are right or wrong or anything.  What I am saying is that groups such as #BlackLivesMatter and the #AntifaTerrorists or any individuals destroying peoples' shit will cause trouble people to respond in kind.  That's #commonsense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Schmaniel @MikeMason830 @AOC No, I didn't say that either.  But while were are on the subject.  What lead you to believe that any of the actions by the arresting officers in #GeorgeFloyd's death were based on race?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Schmaniel @MikeMason830 @AOC And?  If #BlackLivesMatter and or #AntifaTerrorists want to throw temper tantrums for whatever bullshit reason, then so be it.  That doesn't deter my vote.  #2A<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Schmaniel @MikeMason830 @AOC I never said the #Democrats were racist.  I said they assign #racism to everything they can.  Like you just did in your tweet.

<|startoftext|>@Shadow_of_702 @pumpactionmusk1 @altino_q @FredTJoseph Any evidence that the cops were racist? And more specifically that their actions involving Floyd or Blake were racially motivated?  Until you can find some, I recommend you shut yo mouf. I'll wait.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shadow_of_702 @pumpactionmusk1 @altino_q @FredTJoseph I don't want people shot.  They are getting shot because they are destroying peoples' stuff.  And yes, #racism IS a false narrative in the cases of Floyd and Blake.  Had nothing to do with race.  Just stupidity by pieces of shit who happen to be black.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shadow_of_702 @pumpactionmusk1 @altino_q @FredTJoseph Then STOP DESTROYING PEOPLES' SHIT.  What part of that is going over your head?

<|startoftext|>@donaldtrumpPOS Here are the top 15 countries for #coronavirus sorted by deaths per million people.  Pay particular attention to Brazil and Mexico.

<|startoftext|>@WoollyMammoth19 @SenWarren Oh, I agree there has to be accountabilities for police.  There also have to be accountabilities on THE PEOPLE as well.  Floyd and Blake bear responsibility for what happened as well.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WoollyMammoth19 @SenWarren The taxpayer also pays the medical costs when those same "pigs" are hit with bricks by "peaceful protesters".

<|startoftext|>@WoollyMammoth19 @SenWarren True. You never said race.  Although, it's the only reason these stories are national news.  The false racism narrative.  And yes, cops do have more protections against financial repercussions.  I believe all the major PD's have unions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BFriedmanDC @JeriLRyan Your theory has more holes in it than Jacob Blake's back.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WoollyMammoth19 @SenWarren No I'm not.  The govt is accountable.  All the cops with Floyd are facing charges.  The ones with Blake probably get a slap on the wrist as well.

<|startoftext|>@jordandiminich @LavErrTee @nan1964forever @RogueIsland2 @NBC10 It's up to the people.  It always has been.  It works better in some countries because of the people.  Because of the culture.  Look at our culture.  There's your answer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ok_first_off @RealJamesWoods I think all schools are closed in Rhode Island on Election Day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jordandiminich @LavErrTee @nan1964forever @RogueIsland2 @NBC10 do anyhow.  The virus is way more widespread than anyone thinks (I have been saying this since day one - just my gut feeling).  You have asymptomatic people running around (not their fault).  Plus, it's so mild that 80% that get it have the flu.  That's it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jordandiminich @LavErrTee @nan1964forever @RogueIsland2 @NBC10 First off, put that 150,000 into perspective.  Before #coronavirus even started, 7,200 people died EVERY DAY in the U.S.  So since March 1 on any other year, we would have over 1,100,000 people dying in that same time frame.  Secondly, there is only so much the governments can..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods Technically not true.  They close some schools on Election Day specifically because people come in and vote.  The school is "closed" for education that day but is open for voters to come in and vote.  That's how my polling station works.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jordandiminich @LavErrTee @nan1964forever @RogueIsland2 @NBC10 I wouldn't stand for that.  A federal lock down?  No way.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jordandiminich @LavErrTee @nan1964forever @RogueIsland2 @NBC10 What kind of intervention into our daily lives would the Federal government be able to put in place?  And how many governors are going to roll over and play along?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jordandiminich @LavErrTee @nan1964forever @RogueIsland2 @NBC10 Common fallacy.  The "Left" or "Right" at the federal level cannot control day-to-day lives of the citizenry.

<|startoftext|>@Pikeitberk @MChieftech714 @TIME Regularly?  And systemic racism is a bullshit narrative.  Like George Floyd is evidence of systemic racism?  It isnt.

<|startoftext|>@Pikeitberk @MChieftech714 @TIME According to the Tuskegee Institute, 4,743 people were lynched between 1882 and 1968 in the United States, including 3,446 African Americans and 1,297 whites.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@shimonnyman @TaoistGolfer @JeriLRyan I am very much against #blacklivesmatter as it is a false narrative as well as a borderline terrorist organization in my opinion.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MChieftech714 @TIME Yes, all that shit happened 150+ years ago.  I think black conservative means they have moved on and don't use it as an excuse today.  Just my opinion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GHS So the lab technicians, nurses and transportation personal will all work for free?  And the equipment will magically appear from nowhere at no cost to anyone?  https://t.co/rSQdR1cFPx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods @YouTube Yes.  I thought the same thing myself.  The death of a black man INSTANTLY equated to #racism before the body was even cold.   The mainstream media, #BlackLivesMatter , and left wing loons took the incident as racism and ran with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaoistGolfer @JeriLRyan Pretty depressing when the #racism card is the only thing you have to play, isn't it?  Well, it didn't work in 2016.  Will it work this time?  Stay tuned....  https://t.co/qXz8bCGQkp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VirginiaStark46 @joesichspach @GovWhitmer Our Governor has gone full blown gestapo on us for having social gatherings of more than 15 people.

Men bursting into woman's home and pistol whipping her, they clean up the mess.  10 gun homicides over a weekend, they clean up the mess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mkss74623347 @Oliviershill @shebmiller @terrycrews Yes, the people that signed up for the job.  The people who risk their lives everyday to clean up the mess left by career criminals like #GeorgeFloyd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mkss74623347 @Oliviershill @shebmiller @terrycrews Then tell me, who is going to come to the ghetto and clean up the mess?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mkss74623347 @Oliviershill @shebmiller @terrycrews And the cops?  The cops who see the same shit day in and day out?  The cops who HAVE TO INVESTIGATE the messes made by criminals.  Plus the disrespect they get from the people they are trying to help.  Then there's the ghetto code of NOT cooperating with police.  No matter what.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mkss74623347 @Oliviershill @shebmiller @terrycrews And the cops will have their day in Court.  But had George acted civilized, I bet the whole thing wouldn't have happened.  He could have prevented it as well.  That's the point I've been trying to make. BOTH parties used poor judgement.  But no one is bringing that up nationally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mkss74623347 @Oliviershill @shebmiller @terrycrews No.  Never said the cops get a pass.  In fact, I would like to hear from the cops who stood around and watched that asshole cop kneel on that piece of shit.  What were they thinking. I said had George acted civilized during the encounter, he would probably be alive today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mkss74623347 @Oliviershill @shebmiller @terrycrews Unions.  You got me there.  Unions have no place in the public sector, IMO.  And aren't most unions in bed with the @DNC?  I am asking because I honestly don't know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mkss74623347 @Oliviershill @shebmiller @terrycrews No.  Not my family.  My family was raised to act like civilized human beings.  Zero chance of being killed by police.  Look at all the cases.  My bet is the lion's share could have been avoided if people were taught how to interact with #LawEnforcement<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mkss74623347 @Oliviershill @shebmiller @terrycrews Out of 10,000,000 arrests.  LOL.  0.02%. Play the lottery while your at it.  Plus take into account the behavior of the person that died.  That has to be factored in (but won't).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mkss74623347 @Oliviershill @shebmiller @terrycrews No.  Not if he acted like a civilized human being.  Had he done that, he would probably be alive today.  Blame the #CultureOfViolence as well as the whole "Fuck da police" mentality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mkss74623347 @Oliviershill @shebmiller @terrycrews Last one I saw was in 2018 when the Eagles won the super bowl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mkss74623347 @Oliviershill @shebmiller @terrycrews Addressing blue crime in a blue inner city that has had blue local, blue state and blue federal Representatives for DECADES.   And somehow it's the fault of the @GOP ?🤷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mkss74623347 @Oliviershill @shebmiller @terrycrews Yes it does matter if he was a career criminal.  That's the point.  You don't change the rules to suit career criminals who finally run into someone they can't push around.  Goes to the whole #CultureOfViolence that has somehow become acceptable behavior.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mkss74623347 @Oliviershill @shebmiller @terrycrews Yet you take one incident of a career criminal running afoul of some asshole cops out of millions of arrests each year and portray that as the problem?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mkss74623347 @Oliviershill @shebmiller @terrycrews And the #BlackLivesMatter group is totally ignoring (although you say it's being addressed) the behavior of blacks towards each other as well as  #LawEnforcement .  Which is what causes all this mess in the first place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mkss74623347 @Oliviershill @shebmiller @terrycrews Yes.  Exactly the same way a few police  encounters are cherry picked from the 10,000,000 arrests in the USA each year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mkss74623347 @Oliviershill @shebmiller @terrycrews And they are joining in on the violence started by the #BlackLivesMatter group who went batshit crazy when yet another career criminal (Floyd) ran into some asshole cops.  That was the catalyst (plus it's an election year) that started this recent mess.  https://t.co/1z5ofpVSIE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mkss74623347 @Oliviershill @shebmiller @terrycrews Yes.  The police do that.  In fact, they do it to white people as well.  But you rarely see white people rioting about it.  Why?  Because they pursue the correct avenue to address it.  You don't burn down a store and tell everyone you're either with us or against us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mkss74623347 @Oliviershill @shebmiller @terrycrews Well, I hope you do well.  But you have to keep in mind that in order to function in a civilized society, people are expected to act civilized.  Not only for the sake of #LawAndOrder , but the sake of the community.  You cannot have a culture of violence and achieve that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mkss74623347 @Oliviershill @shebmiller @terrycrews I think violence is usually bullying by people who cannot express themselves in a civilized manner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mkss74623347 @Oliviershill @shebmiller @terrycrews When was the last riot after a football game?  The Super Bowl?  And there was like 10 people at the riot?  And did any of the white folks arrested claim #SystemicRacism .  God Dammed NFL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mkss74623347 @Oliviershill @shebmiller @terrycrews None of that excuses bad behavior today.  Here.  Now.  None of that excuses crimes committed today.  Here.  Now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mkss74623347 @shebmiller @Oliviershill @terrycrews Root cause.  Commit crimes and people call the police.  Thus causing an interaction with the police.  Address the #CultureOfViolence to REDUCE the crimes and therefore reduce the interactions with the police.  In simple terms: stop the crime and the cops go away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mkss74623347 @shebmiller @Oliviershill @terrycrews #BlackLivesMatter is behind the movement.  And all this looting and burning started in the name of career criminal #GeorgeFloyd who ran into some asshole cops on a bad day (they will get theirs).  Had the #CultureOfViolence been addressed, the whole thing could have been avoided.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mkss74623347 @shebmiller @Oliviershill @terrycrews Oh, absolutely.  Although I think "child pedophilia" is redundant.  People that abuse kids are the worst kind of scum.  #SaveOurChildren gets my vote.  However, the white community isn't looting/burning stores or tearing down statues for people who go to jail for pedophilia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mkss74623347 @shebmiller @Oliviershill @terrycrews Glad to hear that.  And you are right, I didn't know.  I look forward to seeing the culture of violence in the black community addressed on the national stage with the same vigor as the #racism agenda.   Perhaps a #CultureOfViolence hashtag trending on twitter one day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bradlander Any of this money you trying to get going to address the culture of violence in poor communities?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shebmiller @Oliviershill @terrycrews "Terry Crews distracts from the conversation by implying what he said is even a thing".  Kind of like the conversation about reducing #crime by the African American community being distracted by #SystemicRacism and #racism narratives?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenWarren @SenRubioPress Very good.  Now apply that same logic to the #manufacturing sector and you will be doing the #USA a great service.  Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulWuTangClan @TIME If Americans wanted "safe and competent", then we would still be a British colony.  I think Americans just want the freedom to succeed or fail and the government to get out of the way.  At least this one does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NASA @NASAPersevere My #AskNASA! question:  Will the new rovers be able to clear off the dust that accumulates on them while on #Mars ?  I would also like to second the motion that some sort of live streaming be set up.  That would be amazing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ishopmara @cenkuygur @Booker4KY @chuckschumer That isn't just the Trump view.  "if i don't win then it was because the system was corrupt" is literally the calling card for the @DNC , #BlackLivesMatter , #inequality , #Feminism #electoralreformsnow  #Millennials  and all the other hashtags claiming butt-hurt on Twitter.  https://t.co/nGAJNhVv3s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mentalhazord @gabbywitha_yuh @Johnnystash7 And if #BlackLivesMatter was really about making the lives of black people better, they might want to address the culture of violence towards black women and children at the hands of black men.  Surprised the #MeToo people sit quietly about this as well.  https://t.co/bEE64NVsw3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HeatherGarcia11 @MSNBC There are more important things than the #coronavirus right now.  There is an election in November and the false #racism narrative must take precedence.  And if cases spike in the meantime, simply blame Trump.  https://t.co/PKISv3NP3I<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nhannahjones @rlpage_insp "That is how it works"?  Anyone can go ahead and topple any statue they don't like and THEN we share opinions on whether it should have even been there in the first place?  I wonder what the #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter folks will discuss the day after this comes down.🤔  https://t.co/m6NJvJP5FG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neiltyson @gerbreenkerry I am sorry but I would label you as fun.  You make science fun and engaging.  And I think that makes the world a better place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joesichspach Looks like two people got shot: "Officers responded to Harborview and were informed that one of the victims, a 19-year-old male, had died from injuries. The other victim, also a male, unknown age, remains in the hospital with life-threatening injuries."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elkay101 @Mikemilli_MME @RealJamesWoods Only major offense he had. The Court records are all over the internet.  But be cautious as there is a ton of fake news out there.  One of the conservative pundits was saying the woman was pregnant at the time(she wasn't).  No mention of that in court documents that I read.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mikemilli_MME @elkay101 @RealJamesWoods Pointed at?  Is that the ghetto term for SIX MEN storming into a woman's home and tossing the place while one of them pistol whips her as she cried for help?  Obviously, A COORDINATED AND REHEARSED plan.  But, I am sure it was a one-time thing.🤔   .  .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mikemilli_MME @elkay101 @RealJamesWoods Yes. It takes intoxication to see that some people are cowards and pick women to beat up and rob.  Pardon me if I don't weep when they finally run into someone they can't push around.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mikemilli_MME @elkay101 @RealJamesWoods Someone, somewhere on the planet having slaves either today (India) or in the past is not an excuse for career criminals  (Floyd).  Behavior like his (criminal) IS THE REASON that cops have to clean up the ghettos in the first place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeWPratt @Brender__ @GovRaimondo Agree 100 percent.  Poor in USA is a lot different than poor in other countries.  https://t.co/yBzoe0PXkq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeWPratt @Brender__ @GovRaimondo And I agree.  I don't fault anyone trying to get a better life.  What steams my clams is that we literally have a class of second class citizens due to our elected assholes.  Both sides.😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Reprevise @TanCoulterUSA @GovRaimondo Well I see one site with $300,000,000 and I think to myself that cannot be right.  That's Hillary money.  I am going to delete my tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CameronMarshall @ChessiePique @RevDrBarber Not implying Trump is #racist or not.  Just posting random pictures.  Perhaps you will find this one more to your liking. #TDS  https://t.co/RxcxmixGfz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_LoveMTB_ @RealJamesWoods #HumanNature 101: Meet the next generation of evil people.  But whatever you do, don't call them evil or disagree with them or you risk being labeled a #racist like James.  No soup for you!  https://t.co/KTclKrp1uh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_LoveMTB_ @RealJamesWoods Well, I don't know the man's finances but I have seen him play poker🤦‍♂️, so anything is possible if the money is right.    My bigger fear still would be the young actors struggling to start.  These are their "make or break" roles sometimes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_LoveMTB_ @RealJamesWoods No.  @RealJamesWoods is retired. He doesn't have to work.  Therefore, he cannot be INTIMIDATED by the pressure to either "fall in line" with our political beliefs or not work.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cjmath @anniekarni @AngrierWHStaff Stole this one today.  Even funnier. #TDS  https://t.co/XqNZpI0y0b<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovRaimondo I disagree.  #IllegalAliens should not benefit from most public programs.  Those should be for immigrants WHO PLAYED BY THE RULES and are here legally as well as American citizens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Empath_g_app No, race does not play a factor in everything.  You infer #racism where none exists.  Floyd's body wasn't even cold and everyone was clamoring on about racism.  Without knowing all the facts.  We still don't know all the facts.  Maybe it was.  Maybe not.  There will be a trial.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Empath_g_app Sure, bring it on.  Whites also.  I'll tell them all the same thing:  If you beat up on women, children or the elderly because they are easy targets and continue with that behavior, eventually you are going to run into the wrong person.  Race got nothing to do with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Empath_g_app Not saying any of that.  Never said anything the police have done lately (which made the news) was okay.  What I am saying is that if #GeorgeFloyd had acted like a civilized human being while engaging with law enforcement, he would probably be alive today. #CommonSense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pinkfloyd I loved the scene in "The Wall" where the teacher finds our protagonist scribbling the lyrics to "Money" and reads them to the class. (Had to delete earlier tweet because I said antagonist).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@at_mads @GovRaimondo How do you interact with space aliens?  I don't see the relevance of your question.  https://t.co/VXLaMWMkzZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Empath_g_app I didn't say black people were bad.  I said act like civilized human beings.  That applies to all races. I don't support police bursting into anyone's home and killing them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Empath_g_app Well, I also don't burst into a woman's home and have my buddies pistol whip her while I rob the place. So, you got me there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBC10 So nice that elected officials can change the name of our state on a whim.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Empath_g_app Yes, it's racist to point out the #CommonSense things in life.  It's also racist to point out existing policies that are available to everyone who needs them.  My apologies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Empath_g_app @TIME @yassmin_a So act like a civilized human being during your interaction with #LawEnforcement and then file a complaint.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChessiePique @RevDrBarber  https://t.co/kXVV44zAoF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TIME Oh, the humanity!  Someone having the audacity to hold an event on a day (now an entire weekend) blacks have designated as theirs and no one else's.  https://t.co/1dJxqzpHB8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChessiePique @RevDrBarber  https://t.co/fFeeoBUyFT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovRaimondo Can we also come out with a guide on how to interact with #LawEnforcement ?  That might eliminate some trouble.  https://t.co/fZRo7lwKNT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChessiePique @RevDrBarber No.  But I like pictures.  Do you have pictures to share?  https://t.co/9c00hwPVb7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TIME @yassmin_a As a white person, I appreciate the sentiment.  However, I already know how to interact with #LawEnforcement in a respectable manner.  Granted, that doesn't happen often as I don't commit many crimes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChessiePique @RevDrBarber Well, that would vary depending on area.  Plus we would have to separate drug offenses that lead to jail time from other criminal activity that also lead to jail time.  That might be difficult for career criminals who branched out into other areas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nbc10_brian @NBC10 @GovRaimondo Well, we are almost there.  Next year isn't an election year so we can go back to treating the flu like we always did and not report every single death.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChessiePique @RevDrBarber Confused.  Do you mean the wages they would have earned with a legitimate job or the money they would've earned while slinging dope?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mulchinger @smathemathers @rgrokett @Fate74267847 @neiltyson I don't remember seeing a poll addressing as to why the protests were happening.  We can always ask.  Excuse me, folks.  Why are you protesting? (Check all that apply).  🔲 #GeorgeFloyd  🔲 Systemic #racism 🔲 Confederate statues 🔲 Images on syrup bottles 🔲 All of the above  https://t.co/xyFiaWj7A4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MBAWorldTravelr @nicholasvirzi @TIME Probably because the mass murderer gave himself up and didn't resist. What part of that is difficult to understand?🤷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mulchinger @smathemathers @rgrokett @Fate74267847 @neiltyson Well #GeorgeFloyd getting killed IS THE REASON for all the uproar.  And I don't care if the whole world is #racist and how fucking poor you are, bursting into a woman's home and beating her while you rob her is wrong.  And is the reason cops have to come in and clean up the mess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mulchinger @smathemathers @rgrokett @Fate74267847 @neiltyson Systemic #racism caused #GeorgeFloyd to burst into a woman's home with 5 other armed guys?  Did it cause them to pistol whip the poor woman as she cried out for help? Did #racism call the police afterwards?  Or was it other citizens?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mulchinger @smathemathers @rgrokett @Fate74267847 @neiltyson Don't shoot the messenger, pal.  It's the FBI's numbers that show the stats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mulchinger @smathemathers @rgrokett @Fate74267847 @neiltyson I can't speak to kneeling but there are tons of incidents where cops use unnecessary force and sometimes kill white people.  More than blacks but, to be fair, there are a tons of white folks in this country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mulchinger @smathemathers @rgrokett @Fate74267847 @neiltyson I agree 💯. The cops have to follow the rules and have NO RIGHT to kill without justification.  But #CommonSense says this won't happen to me.   Not because I am white but because I don't put myself in that type of situation by breaking laws constantly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mulchinger @smathemathers @rgrokett @Fate74267847 @neiltyson A shitload more white guys are killed by cops and we never see this type of uproar.  Even if the cop is black.  No one screams #racism .  No one goes out destroying property.  You have ZERO proof this event was based on #racism by the cops.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mulchinger @smathemathers @rgrokett @Fate74267847 @neiltyson I dont.  The cop will have a trial.  If found guilty, he will go to jail.  Same for the asshole cops who just stood there.  But it wasn't #racism (unless you got some proof the rest of us don't know about).  George's behavior played a part also.  You can't ignore that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@houndsnmules @RealJamesWoods Because some people are cowards and will push around people who are weak.  It's not a black or white thing in my opinion, it's a culture thing.  And it makes me sick.  And if this asshole gets put down by the cops (like #GeorgeFloyd ), it will be portrayed as #racism 🤷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewNeill91 @RealJamesWoods Twitter could use more posts like this.  👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mulchinger @smathemathers @rgrokett @Fate74267847 @neiltyson Correct.  Our rebellion against British was good.  It freed us from a tyrannical ruler (my opinion).  The southern states forming a Confederate State to keep slavery around was bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mulchinger @smathemathers @rgrokett @Fate74267847 @neiltyson #GeorgeFloyd died because HE FINALLY RAN INTO SOMEONE HE COULDN'T PUSH AROUND.  It's a lot easier to beat up defenseless women than it is the police.  The piece of shit learned that lesson the hard way.  It had nothing to do with #racism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mulchinger @smathemathers @rgrokett @Fate74267847 @neiltyson And we were ready for those circumstances when they came.  Took action when we could.  Luck had little to do with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mulchinger @smathemathers @rgrokett @Fate74267847 @neiltyson No.  And it's already been tried (civil war).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mulchinger @smathemathers @rgrokett @Fate74267847 @neiltyson No, you are not.  The only message coming across is that it's #racism (when it isn't).  I see NO ONE speaking out against bad behavior by the bad citizens.  Only when they eventually run into a policeman who they can't push around.Then all hell breaks lose because of evil police.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UNITEDWEDREAM @SenWarren Yay.  An entire class of second class citizens we can exploit for whatever we want! Thank you @DNC 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mulchinger @smathemathers @rgrokett @Fate74267847 @neiltyson Luck?  Are you kidding me?  We pulled off the unthinkable at the time.  We revolted against British rule.  And won.  We had big help (France) but thousands paid the ultimate price to become free. Many people pulled together and fought.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mulchinger @smathemathers @rgrokett @Fate74267847 @neiltyson That's right.  We live in a 1st world stable county.  You think we got here how?  Did some entity swoop in and make us this way or did we come together and fight for it?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mulchinger @smathemathers @rgrokett @Fate74267847 @neiltyson I agree, BUT IN ORDER FOR THAT TO WORK,  the people also have to act like civilized human beings.  The PEOPLE have to stand up to crime and HELP.  The PEOPLE have to respect #LawAndOrder as well as obey it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mulchinger @smathemathers @rgrokett @Fate74267847 @neiltyson And that should tell you something.  The PEOPLE of that country don't want to change. But if we sit idle and do nothing, the bad regimes stay in place causing grief.  It's lose/lose unless the people of the country stand up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mulchinger @smathemathers @rgrokett @Fate74267847 @neiltyson Yes.  Like I said, it's ALWAYS up to the people in the long run.  It's easy to remove a bad regime.  But it's a Herculean and long process to build a free country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mulchinger @smathemathers @rgrokett @Fate74267847 @neiltyson ...A lot of clips also show bad behavior on the "protesters" part as well.  Not to mention the bad behavior (crime) that caused all this mess in the first place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mulchinger @smathemathers @rgrokett @Fate74267847 @neiltyson Well, we aren't one Democratic country.  We are made up of 50 states and some territories.

<|startoftext|>@mulchinger @smathemathers @Fate74267847 @neiltyson There is waste and fraud in the military budget.  Having said that, I sleep good knowing my country has the world's most powerful military.  And wouldn't want it any other way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mulchinger @smathemathers @rgrokett @Fate74267847 @neiltyson We (The USA) can only remove hostile governments.  We cannot force out ways onto other countries once it's done. It's up to the people.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mulchinger @smathemathers @rgrokett @Fate74267847 @neiltyson I agree 💯 and would add that cops are human also.  The point I am trying to convey is that no one is addressing the reason cops are there in the first place.  The crimes being committed as well as the behavior of citizens in the effected areas especially towards law enforcement.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@smathemathers @mulchinger @rgrokett @Fate74267847 @neiltyson I agree.  As are arrests by police.  Over 10,000,000 a year in the U.S.  But we only see certain ones on the news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smathemathers @mulchinger @rgrokett @Fate74267847 @neiltyson I won't call you naive.  Enemy is a word that should be used with caution.  Usually reserved for governments of "bad" countries (not necessarily the people that live there).  And yes I agree in second chances when it comes to people.  Usually.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smathemathers @mulchinger @rgrokett @Fate74267847 @neiltyson Agree.  Help the foreign country on it's path to freedom.  We also have the CIA to help with toppling governments that we feel are bad (we tamper with elections - just like Russia).  I am sure other countries are doing what's best for themselves pertaining to illegal immigrants.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smathemathers @mulchinger @Fate74267847 @neiltyson With all do respect, we have been trying that for decades.  Public education is a great example.  Spending goes up and up and up, yet results are laughable best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smathemathers @mulchinger @rgrokett @Fate74267847 @neiltyson We are talking about two different things.  I was referring to other countries where people aren't free and the need to change things there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nbc10_brian @NBC10 @GovRaimondo What if I feel fine and refuse a medical test?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mulchinger @smathemathers @Fate74267847 @neiltyson And that crime should be frowned upon and punished.  I've heard too many people tell me they won't help the police if the crime didn't affect them directly.  That attitude must change in order for crime to go bye bye.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smathemathers @mulchinger @rgrokett @Fate74267847 @neiltyson Protesting is fine.  In fact, it should be encouraged (IMO).  But when does a protest end and a crime start?  https://t.co/HUr1Mm39Sh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mulchinger @smathemathers @Fate74267847 @neiltyson Who determines if something is racist?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smathemathers @mulchinger @Fate74267847 @neiltyson Well we will disagree on this as well.  Blindly pumping money into the environment won't work.  The people in the environment have to want to improve things.  It's always up to the people (individually as well as the community) at the end of the day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smathemathers @mulchinger @rgrokett @Fate74267847 @neiltyson If you take the options of killing or death off the table, then you have already lost the war before you have started the battle.  Because your enemy now knows how far you are willing to go and no farther.  Option.  Not mandatory.  An option nonetheless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mulchinger @smathemathers @rgrokett @Fate74267847 @neiltyson Well, it will have to be addressed eventually or things will continue as they are. People will continue to flee and become illegals here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mulchinger @smathemathers @rgrokett @Fate74267847 @neiltyson I never said it would be easy. I said a potential solution (mine) was a simple but deadly one.  If you change the host country for the better, the need for people to flee goes away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smithsonian @SmithsonianFolk The killing of black men only gets national attention when the suspected killer isn't black.  The same goes with black women.  #Sayhername vanished like a fart in the wind on Twitter when news came out the suspect wasn't white.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mulchinger @smathemathers @rgrokett @Fate74267847 @neiltyson It is simple but it is also deadly.  In order to affect change in the host country, people may need to fight (like we did in 1776ish) to overthrow a bad government.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@smathemathers @mulchinger @Fate74267847 @neiltyson I say it starts with upbringing over environment.  Agree that environment is a big factor, but some people do make it out of a bad environment.  Find the answer as to why that happens and I bet it has something to do with family or friends influences.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smathemathers @rgrokett @mulchinger @Fate74267847 @neiltyson If you stop the need for people to come here illegally, then you have addressed problems of illegal immigrants as well as human trafficking.  If the country they are coming from is indeed a "shit hole", correct THAT and you've solved the problem at the source.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smathemathers @mulchinger @Fate74267847 @neiltyson It starts with behavior.  Address bad behavior (instead of calling it racist to point it out) and you address the problem head on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smathemathers @rgrokett @mulchinger @Fate74267847 @neiltyson Maybe.  I, for one, don't like the creation of second class citizens (illegal immigrants) which are exploited by traffickers in order to get victims into the country in the first place.  Address that and you address the problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smathemathers @mulchinger @Fate74267847 @neiltyson I disagree.  Criminals who went through the due process of being convicted of a crime have to be put somewhere.  They also need to be taught a lessen (don't commit crimes).  No, I'm not saying forced labour is the answer but something has to be done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rgrokett @smathemathers @mulchinger @Fate74267847 @neiltyson Trump (along with lovely daughter Ivanka) has been addressing Human trafficking since he took office.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimWhiteRI Plus, they will have to be dismantled after the elections in November (unless Trump wins again).  There will undoubtedly be costs associated with that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mulchinger @Fate74267847 @neiltyson Some would say India.  India has an estimated 8 million people living in modern slavery.  Bonded labour, child labour, forced marriages, etc...  Plus there is China.  Maker of all those gizmos and gadgets we can't get enough of and at really cheap prices.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nathansgreen @CurrentGiant @HawleyMO @TuckerCarlson And I've been watching a non-stop stream of videos for over 4 DECADES of atrocious behavior by a culture (ghetto) that is the reason police have to intervene in the first place.

<|startoftext|>@CurrentGiant @nathansgreen @HawleyMO @TuckerCarlson I agree.  Behavior.  Nothing is said about behavior.  Especially the behavior that leads to someone calling the police.  Not a damn word.  https://t.co/4Jn0wsESnv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nocturne20C @militantgay @DanielleRSenat @wcvet @ItssDunke Wrong.  Two black men have been found dead.  Nobody know what caused their deaths (one was originally ruled a suicide).  So until you get some FACTS, I recommend you shut yo mouf.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Grizzlegoist @seantcronin @GO_HOME_BOI @RuralMissionary @Josh_Moon @ThabitiAnyabwil Good.  Then we can agree that people need to act like civilized human beings.  This message should be spread to everyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@militantgay @DanielleRSenat @wcvet @Nocturne20C @ItssDunke No, not a double standard.  Given the history of what happens during a #BlackLivesMatter "protest😉", precautions are necessary.  The evidence is overwhelming as to the damage done.  https://t.co/a42WYFWyaG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seantcronin @Grizzlegoist @GO_HOME_BOI @RuralMissionary @Josh_Moon @ThabitiAnyabwil I think we can both agree if the guy had acted like a civilized human being then the situation could have been avoided.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seantcronin @Grizzlegoist @GO_HOME_BOI @RuralMissionary @Josh_Moon @ThabitiAnyabwil Nope.  Didn't say that either but nice try.  There is a difference between verbal disrespect and verbal disrespect coupled with aggressive actions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emmylife2nv @maddow What happens when blacks call the police to clean up the mess made by other blacks that are terrorizing their hood?  Is that dehumanizing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seantcronin @Grizzlegoist @GO_HOME_BOI @RuralMissionary @Josh_Moon @ThabitiAnyabwil Neither of us were there. All we see in the video is a man running his mouth and making aggressive hand gestures while walking towards the police. Most of the people I know wouldn't do that as it's just fucking stupid.  He'd probably be okay had he acted like a civilized person.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@seantcronin @Grizzlegoist @GO_HOME_BOI @RuralMissionary @Josh_Moon @ThabitiAnyabwil I didn't say that.  I don't know what the correct response would be.

<|startoftext|>@ThealGail @KirstenPowers Confederate statues are being removed as they are offensive to some.  I would think we could extend that same courtesy to women as there's a shitload of statues, roads, schools, etc.. attached to historical names that treated women like crap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KirstenPowers I bet it's because there are statues of people that victimized women.  Let's tear them down.  https://t.co/Xqv4EmCzv6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TGalore2 @maddow Wrong.  Some lives matter.  You just have to be a career criminal and pistol whip women like #GeorgeFloyd and his gang did.  Then people will care when you die.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@maddow Your map of Ohio looks suspiciously like North Carolina.😐  https://t.co/d1vKK0GibP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chantessicaaa Again, millions upon millions of arrests are made each year.  You are trying to turn the exceptions into the norm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chantessicaaa @KC_Peso @TheWashedGawd No.  They weren't targeted because they were black.  Blacks apparently cause a lot of trouble (according to FBI Crime stats) and police go where the trouble is.  Behave like civilized citizens and the cops go away.  Easy peasey.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chantessicaaa @KC_Peso @TheWashedGawd There were 10,310,960 arrests in 2018 (latest I could find).  How many made the news?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maddow I am curious if you be also reporting (gleefully) on the upcoming spike of #coronavirus cases in the black community due to the #BlackLivesMatter and #GeorgeFloydProtests protests/riots.  https://t.co/ICWbcsUoEd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chantessicaaa @KC_Peso @TheWashedGawd There are exceptions.  Was the last thing I typed.  But to instantly link the death of a black person to racism first and then ask questions is the wrong way to go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joquinn06 @TIME You also gonna ask the folks in the hood to send back the free money that trickles down from the evil white man every month?  You seem to have no problems being appeased by that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chantessicaaa @TheWashedGawd You only care because it involves a white boy.  That's is THE ONLY REASON.  And only the inner cities are on fire.  That is where the majority of blacks live.  Good job assholes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@joesichspach Scientific fact:  #coronavirus cannot be transmitted between  #BlackLivesMatter people.  So they cannot be blamed for it's spread.  They can, however, have higher infection rates because of something the evil white man has done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC @AOC is half right.  #BlackLivesMatter  also needs to give change.  Start holding blacks accountable for their actions instead of excusing it with either the false racism or false privilege narrative blankets statements.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reaIDonaldTurpm @SavingPolitics @AOC @DNC Privilege is a bullshit term.  Funny how only #BlackLivesMatter use it and all the other minorities do not.  Asians and Latinos never say it.  I wonder why.  https://t.co/VLc06Lq4Fb<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Mercedes8_S I get the same thing anytime I denounce all the damage being done by #BlackLivesMatter rioters.    Just because I am against destroying innocent peoples' properties doesn't mean I am for the police killing a black person.  https://t.co/cp8N5ScOKC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mercedes8_S That's because of the "You're either with us or against us" mentality behind the whole #BlackLivesMatter narrative.  It's meant to shame anyone who has an independent thought.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KirstenPowers The two have nothing to do with each other.  You don't destroy a building in Seattle for crap that went on in Minneapolis.  The owner of that store or building is defenseless and didn't have anything to do with ANYTHING.  All thanks to #BlackLivesMatter  https://t.co/UckfdGnMqK<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@idobattleangel @fidel_castro20 @jiveDurkey @NoraKAli Can you then explain all the whites that are poor and or homeless.  Did they forget to renew their white privilege cards?

<|startoftext|>@idobattleangel @fidel_castro20 @jiveDurkey @NoraKAli So, if I am privileged based solely on the fact I am white, does that mean all blacks and #BlackLivesMatter are underprivileged or disadvantaged?  What does that mean for Asians and Latinos?  Are they privileged also?  https://t.co/HFluv5f3jx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@idobattleangel @fidel_castro20 @jiveDurkey @NoraKAli Despite evidence (a whole mountain of it) to the contrary of blacks and #BlackLivesMatter actually doing the damage.  And please explain how I am privileged.  I'll wait.....  https://t.co/ddRVM1cFKL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@idobattleangel @fidel_castro20 @jiveDurkey @NoraKAli #BlackLivesMatter as well as the black community as a whole are complicit to the damage being done to innocent people.  When they rise up and tell them to stop the violence against innocent folks, then come talk to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GuyHandshake @Kaiju30418200 @maddiee_kanee You can try if you want.  I don't recommend it.  At the very least, you are going after the ones you think are RESPONSIBLE.  Attacking innocent people in other cities like the #BlackLivesMatter people are doing is pure cowardice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GuyHandshake @Kaiju30418200 @maddiee_kanee The damage is being done in their #BlackLivesMatter name, asshole. They support this type of behavior by not speaking out against it.  Makes them #Complicit .  Sucks when that kind of blame comes the other way, doesn't it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GuyHandshake @Kaiju30418200 @maddiee_kanee Good.  If you have a problem with the police, have the BALLS to confront the police and government in Minneapolis.  Don't go pushing around innocent people elsewhere by burning down their buildings like the blacks and #BlackLivesMatter people are doing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fidel_castro20 @jiveDurkey @NoraKAli White people walked around with AR-15s caused ZERO DAMAGE and didn't hurt (or shoot) anyone.  Blacks and the #BlackLivesMatter group are damaging INNOCENT peoples' properties and burning down innocent peoples' properties because they are FUCKING COWARDS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GuyHandshake @maddiee_kanee You have a problem with the police?  Go talk to the police.  Go to Minneapolis or wherever.  Being a coward and attacking innocent people in other cities like the #BlackLivesMatter people are doing is not helping their case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emrata Thanks princess for your two cents.  But those of us not in ivory towers are a little busy have to deal with the REALITY of the damage that the cowards at #BlackLivesMatter are doing to innocent peoples' properties on a nightly basis.  https://t.co/SmMbFwuR32<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maddiee_kanee Well I say fuck the cowards at #BlackLivesMatter and their supporters.  Destroying innocent peoples' properties just because they are easy targets is inexcusable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmandaMilkovits These #BlackLivesMatter cowards are terrible. If mayor Elorza or the "white woman of privilege" (her words) governor @GovRaimondo aren't going to put a stop to all the damage they are doing, then things will get ugly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC Here's an idea to help with homelessness.  Ask #BlackLivesMatter to stop burning down houses.🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SmitheSasha @POTUS Is the gentleman in the picture trying to help #GeorgeFloydRiots by freeing money from the cash register? You assholes at #Blacklivesmatter are cowards.  You got a problem with cops, then go see the cops.  Don't attack helpless businesses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SmitheSasha @POTUS Well, the WHITE protesters did not fire a single round (even though most were armed).  No reports of damages.  One arrest (protesters fighting amongst themselves).    The #BlackLivesMatter "protesters"?  Beating the shit out of racist cash registers?  https://t.co/HBkzZZqE71<|endoftext|>

You also can speak out against them, write about them, peacefully assemble to share opinions about them as well as petition them for a redress of grievances.

<|startoftext|>@JeebusTrump @FPitch90 @kristal100 Disagree.  Freedom to challenge (stop) those leaders is more important than anything else.  It is my opinion, (I really need to research this), that the founding fathers didn't want a big central government nor a large standing army at their control.  Obviously, we got both.  https://t.co/AohOhaTGtj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeebusTrump @FPitch90 @kristal100 Well, character is subjective by the opinionated (also #hatred ).  You say Obama has more character than Trump?  I would be a complete fool to argue otherwise.  Ive followed this clown since the 80's.  No class.  Whether that makes a better leader I don't know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaniLoving101 @kristal100 I can call Obama "My boy" if I voted for him.  Schoolyard rules apply on Twitter.  And I can assure I did (believe it or not).  I can also assure you I have never claimed to be an ally for black people.  I know blacks.  I engage with blacks.  But no black friends except you.😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeebusTrump @FPitch90 @kristal100 I have no information on Obama cheating on anything.  Ever.  They don't call him chocolate Jesus for nothing.  I was not insinuating Obama cheated in my original tweet.  I was merely pointing out he is just like the rest of the "evil rich" when it comes to actually giving a shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeebusTrump @FPitch90 @kristal100 Everyone cheats when #money is involved. At least with what they think they can get away with.  That's human nature 101.

<|startoftext|>@FPitch90 @kristal100 And?  He's was a businessman.  We all knew this when we voted him to be #mypresident in '16.  The end result is one really rich black President and one really rich white one.  One says they "give a shit" (but don't - see house).  The other doesn't give a shit and never hid it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kristal100 Not triggered by anything.  Just pointing out our boy (I voted for him in '08) is just like the rest.  Furthermore, Trump was a businessman who amassed his fortune (what he didn't get from dad) BEFORE he became #mypresident (and yours).  Not during or after.  You stay safe.  https://t.co/DHl6y6wFw1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kristal100 @briblackley Do you miss Obama and are currently holding a temper tantrum for him to be #mypresident again?  Maybe you can stay with him in his $11,750,000 house since he cares so much about you and the common folk.  Just a thought.  https://t.co/F1fAXR5I7i<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SirLiberal @cmclymer @FredTJoseph @AOC I was going to say that.  What other profession can you churn out a worsening product every single year and have the audacity to not only demand raises but get them?  Answer:  Teachers and their lovely union.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SappPDXapE @Well1la @marthamallory1 While I agree a boycott works best,   I don't agree Walmart and Amazon pay their employees unfairly.  The bigger problem is the crap they sell.  Most of it, "Made in China".  So go to the source.  #BoycottChina . China treats their people like shit-they have no rights over there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GHS @DrTedros I disagree.  Energy should be cheap and reliable first and foremost if you want to build a better future.  And if it satisfies the #GreenRecovery agenda, then great.  I recommend nuclear.  Or wait and see what happens with India's Thorium rollout for an alternative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marthamallory1 @Well1la Yep.  100k dead folks.  Over 100 days.  That's 1,000 per day.  According to the Census Bureau 7,200 people die EVERY DAY (every 12 seconds) and that's before #coronavirus .  That's the NORMAL.  That's 720,000 people over 100 days.  You give a shit about any of them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Well1la @marthamallory1 Lady, I have no idea if you go to Walmart or Petsmart.  The former just happens to be the second-largest (Amazon just passed them with the #coronavirus assist) retailer on the planet.  So SOMEBODY is obviously going there. My apologies if the notion of shopping there offends you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marthamallory1 @Well1la Very civic-minded of you.  And yes, it's a burden to dawn that mask for an hour of your life.  If the rest of us can put up with all the #coronavirus bullshit every day, you can surely do it for one.  And save your money, you're gonna need it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marthamallory1 @Well1la As you should.  Yes, go vote.  Polling stations (at least in my 'hood) will be no more dangerous than going to Walmart under the threat of #coronavirus or driving on the highway under the threat of #Texting drivers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrTomFrieden @GHS You are a doctor.  You already know that 7,200 people die EVERY DAY in the United States even before the #coronavirus .  That's 720,000 people dead over the same 100 day period.  And that's NORMAL.  Please stop with the fear porn.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DruidicM @BrettGursky @JeriLRyan @realDonaldTrump Glad you aren't in charge of the justice system.  Let me repeat the question:. Can you show me ANY EVIDENCE that the arresting officers' actions were based on #Racism ? I would think you or the #BlackLivesMatter  people should be able to show us that.🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_SianAbigail *Any of the arresting officers.  Stupid auto correct.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_SianAbigail Do any other the arresting officers have history of racial injustices?   Facebook or Twitter postings? Membership in a hate group?  Any friends, relatives, or co-workers coming forward with anything?  Or should I simply believe what the #BlackLivesMatter group says?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrettGursky @JeriLRyan @realDonaldTrump Maybe he is waiting to see what the investigation into the matter reveals.  That's what adults do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_SianAbigail You don't know that he was killed by racism.  None of the officers have said that's why they killed him.  I would think the #BlackLivesMatter people (along with anyone else thinking rationally) would wait to see what the investigation reveals before claiming #Racism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Centazzo @RIprobz @RhodysAutocrat Colorado.  Lady kept inferring I wanted a coffee with milk.  Looked at me like I had two heads when I explained it. Yes, the rest of the world are missing out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SMcdotard @maddow Right.  That's it.  Give that to everyone and then we can get a clearer picture.  I think it's more widespread by a great deal.  It's just too mild for most.  But lethal for some.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SMcdotard @maddow On top of that, the people that don't even realize they have the #coronavirus or that they have already had it and recovered.  Those numbers can never see the light of day unless everyone gets that other test (I forget what they call it).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SMcdotard @maddow Well, you can't.  But that HAS to drive the numbers down.  If you believe original projections that 80% of people will only get MILD symptoms, a great many of those people still won't even get tested as they won't see the need.  That's even more recoveries that won't get reported<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SMcdotard @maddow ...a lot of people don't even realize they have the #coronavirus .  Those numbers don't show up anywhere, but they have to exist.  That is going to drive fatality rates down.  Original WHO report (if memory serves) was 3.4% (4 times normal flu).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SMcdotard @maddow You also need a does of #Commonsense there is no way on God's green earth there are only 1.6 million cases of #coronavirus in the United States.  With the amount of asymptomatic positives coming up, that number has got to be a lot higher.  The virus is so mild for so many... 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SMcdotard @maddow You need to realize we are talking about two different things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SMcdotard @maddow That's the United States page.  Like I said earlier, I was doing deaths as a percentage of the population of the United States(which I mistakenly put in the original tweet).    The world-o-meter was total for the WORLD (active cases) at 98%.  Two different things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SMcdotard @maddow ...And going by Closed cases is also misleading.  On the surface it looks like only 86% of people survive.  But Recoveries/Discharged does not account for people that are recovered without it being recorded anywhere.  Ive seen this 86% really fluctuate over the last 3 months.  https://t.co/Jqj6mIMQcR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SMcdotard @maddow No.  The 95,000 is total deaths (at the time) divided by the Population which is 330 millions.  Active cases (which currently have 2% as serious or critical) cannot predict deaths.  Serious or critical doesn't necessarily mean death.  They are two different measurements.....1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SMcdotard @maddow I was doing deaths as a percentage of population earlier and had that number in my head.  I divided 95,000 by 330,000,000 to get .00028 or 0.028%  But I made an error. The correct % should have been 99.972%.  Active is 98% if the people at World-o-Meter are right.

<|startoftext|>@margaritamimi1 @paullance76 @ruckus2 @maddow It's still going to be in the 90's either way.  The virus is going to kill who it's going to kill.  It's just a matter of when.

<|startoftext|>@number1shred @TimothyPSmith7 @gopnik_larry @ruckus2 @maddow I would like to go on record as saying I don't think Russia is the reason Trump won.  Like I said before, the stuff's been going on since day one.  By every major country I bet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paullance76 @ruckus2 @maddow Agree to disagree :). I think the bigger damage comes from the downturn in economic output.  The U.N.

<|startoftext|>@paullance76 @ruckus2 @maddow I view it as a "We got lucky" with this #coronavirus as far as #pandemic s go.  So far..........🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimothyPSmith7 @number1shred @gopnik_larry @ruckus2 @maddow I agree.  Although I also think 2016 wasn't the first time.  Human nature says this type of thing has been going on since borders were first formed.  What the hell people think our CIA does?  Bake cookies?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paullance76 @ruckus2 @maddow Probably due to the 93,94,95,96,97,98 or 99% (pick your favorite) of people that won't die.   That's how.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tchillmonger1 @rodIsbig @_DrJ Well, I've watched the 30 second video a few times and it's what I saw.  If you have another video, please share.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ruckus2 @maddow Because people need to eat.  That's why.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tchillmonger1 @rodIsbig @_DrJ No.  The first shot was until he got close to the guy with the gun.  I can't hear what everyone is yelling.  Maybe that could add some context.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Thotboyzeus @AngelaGraceLOU @tim_username @Mister_Fun_Guy @DavidBegnaud No, I didn't say you can outrun pellets from a shotgun.  You did.  Why?  I don't know.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@maddow Wow - two months after reports were coming in that #coronavirus really hits the elderly hard.  Now they are starting this.  Should have been done from day one.  How much do these people make?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenMarquette29 @tim_username @Mister_Fun_Guy @DavidBegnaud I'm not justifying anything.  I am not blaming anyone(yet). I am looking at a 30sec video, same as you.  I wait on facts whereas you are making assumptions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenMarquette29 @tim_username @Mister_Fun_Guy @DavidBegnaud Correct.  The black man could have turned to the right and continued running.  He could have also turned around and ran towards the person recording the incident.  He could have also stopped and put his hands up.  If he then got shot it would be a different story, based on video.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Biz_Horse @AngelaGraceLOU @tim_username @Mister_Fun_Guy @DavidBegnaud Split hairs all you want.  My point is that you (or I) were not there. If there is more evidence, it will come out during investigations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ouly @bdl2536 @tim_username @Mister_Fun_Guy @DavidBegnaud Okay, so we have a video.  And now what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Xavierthegr8 @tim_username @Mister_Fun_Guy @DavidBegnaud My argument is irrelevant under the law.  I was not there.  Neither were you.  I am commenting on what I see in the video.  If there is more evidence, it will come out during an investigation.  Twitter doesn't decide.  The courts do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ouly @bdl2536 @tim_username @Mister_Fun_Guy @DavidBegnaud I have no opinion on who deserves to die from watching a 30 second video clip.  If you are willing to say who deserves to die, you better have more evidence than this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Xavierthegr8 @tim_username @Mister_Fun_Guy @DavidBegnaud You do realize this is why we have an entire justice system?   Your emojis aren't helping your argument.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Biz_Horse @tim_username @Mister_Fun_Guy @DavidBegnaud No, it is not equivocating anything.  It's a 30sec video.  If there is more to the story, it will come out in investigations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bdl2536 @Ouly @tim_username @Mister_Fun_Guy @DavidBegnaud The video shows the lone black man running around the stopped vehicle. It also shows him running towards the man who had a gun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fokakp @tim_username @Mister_Fun_Guy @DavidBegnaud How are they stuck?  I have no magical powers or authority to tell people what to do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fokakp @tim_username @Mister_Fun_Guy @DavidBegnaud Opinions vary on that sentiment.  https://t.co/I81MlEOUGs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ouly @tim_username @Mister_Fun_Guy @DavidBegnaud I didn't say any of that.  Projection on your part.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Biz_Horse @tim_username @Mister_Fun_Guy @DavidBegnaud That's right.  All parties could have done something different.  No argument there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenMarquette29 @tim_username @Mister_Fun_Guy @DavidBegnaud I watched the video and he wasn't shot in the back. If you are asking me if he should have been shot in the back, I will answer no based on what I have seen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ouly @tim_username @Mister_Fun_Guy @DavidBegnaud It's your opinion they assassinated him.  It's your opinion he was jogging down the road minding his own business.  We (both you and I and everyone else who wasn't there) are making assumptions without all the fact.  I've only seen the video.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Xavierthegr8 @tim_username @Mister_Fun_Guy @DavidBegnaud Video..man running...two men in truck stopped in road....man runs around truck at TOWARDS man with gun ...shot fired..they scuffle..go off screen.. back on screen man on foot punching man with gun.. more shots..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OnionPirate @tim_username @Mister_Fun_Guy @DavidBegnaud If I saw a man with a gun?  That's a broad statement.  I see men with guns all the time.  Each situation is different. We have only a 30sec video.  No context.  A lot of hearsay though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@turkeyana @tim_username @Mister_Fun_Guy @DavidBegnaud It's a 30 second video.  If there is more context to what happened, it will come out in investigations.  I'm not blaming anyone.  Just pointing out what I see on the video.  Same as you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Xavierthegr8 @tim_username @Mister_Fun_Guy @DavidBegnaud Again.  If you have more video, please share.  I'll wait for any investigations from law enforcement (local, state, fed) and see.  I wasn't there.  Neither were you.  Seems to me you are jumping to a conclusion without all the evidence.  We used to call those lynch mobs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joe_dravencade @tim_username @Mister_Fun_Guy @DavidBegnaud Then all of that can come out during any investigations.  I have only seen this short video.  If you have more video, please share.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OnionPirate @tim_username @Mister_Fun_Guy @DavidBegnaud I didn't say anything about who is responsible.  I have only seen this 30 second video.  If you have more video, please share.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngelaGraceLOU @tim_username @Mister_Fun_Guy @DavidBegnaud Then all that can come out during any investigations into the matter.  From the video I saw, there was a driveway to the right he could have run.  He could have come back towards the guy recording the video.  Guilt or innocence will be determined by a court. Not by us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ms_adroit @tim_username @Mister_Fun_Guy @DavidBegnaud If there is evidence of all that, then it should be brought forth to the appropriate investigative authority.     And to your comments about me being racist, they are uncalled for.  https://t.co/mEqmumpDCF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tim_username @Mister_Fun_Guy @DavidBegnaud From the 30 second video I saw:  No, the guy could have run to the right.  There was a driveway there.  He was running AT the man with a gun when it fired.  It also shows the guy punching at the man with the gun and coming at him.  I can't make out what they are shouting though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AzieTesfai It's your opinion they should be charged (with something - you did not specify in you tweet).  If the authorities in that area (or the state or feds) think likewise, then he/they will be charged (with something).  If so, they will be tried in court.  #AhmaudArbery<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_AintHavinIt @AzieTesfai @Zach6844 In the video, it looks like he was running towards the guy that shot him.  I can't make out what the shouting was though.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jack_msw @DepressedBrowns @Sissy3469 @maddow Dude.  Grow the fuck up.  It's PRISON.  You want to die on a hill over prisoners, go for it.  However, they are at the bottom of the pecking order for my "give a shit" rankings right now.   Help them yes, but more important to focus on the lawful citizens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mat1ildathehun @Sissy3469 @maddow I would have settled on Martha Stewart, but she already got out.  Either way, letting criminals loose is going to harm the ghetto more than anywhere else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jack_msw @DepressedBrowns @Sissy3469 @maddow Lack appropriate health care?  They got free #coronavirus  tests for Christs's sake.  And they didn't even have to make an appointment or go anywhere while law abiding folks have been scrambling around looking for tests.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattJSargent @DepressedBrowns @Sissy3469 @maddow I agree it isn't emotional grandstanding to acknowledge there will be logistical difficulties for prisons.  It is emotional grandstanding to worry about the few deaths in prisons in the grand scheme of things.  But, that's @maddow 's calling card (as well as her sheep).  Victims.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattJSargent @DepressedBrowns @Sissy3469 @maddow Well, I would think they would quarantine the prison after results like this.  Guards can go to home isolation.  New guards wear hazmat suits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Taurenbeastmas1 @Sissy3469 @maddow Which is what I originally wanted to comment about.  Prisoners getting testing for #coronavirus when law abiding(more or less) citizens are trying to get tested and cannot.  https://t.co/DMQUCIgh9h<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tomakazee @mikah_no @DepressedBrowns @Sissy3469 @maddow "Fearporn"?  I like it.  Can I use it?  https://t.co/nZCKyLlwaB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CurtisIP1 @Sissy3469 @maddow You are right, I probably wouldn't walk through a prison if I could.  #coronavirus or not.  You got me there.  But no, I go out protected.  I wear the stupid mask and stay distanced.  Even if others (assholes) do not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CurtisIP1 @Sissy3469 @maddow I'd love to.  However, I don't think I could go.  They just don't let anybody into prison.  In fact, you usually need to go through a trial and then a judge to sign off on it.  Seems like a lot of work just to prove a point on Twitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mat1ildathehun @Sissy3469 @maddow I don't think anything violates the 8th amendment.  However, if the courts say otherwise and all prisoners are released, I can live with that also.  As I highly doubt many of them are going to settle in my neighborhood unless it's the Madoff crowd being let out.😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DepressedBrowns @Sissy3469 @maddow LOL.  I get more triggered by people putting pineapple on pizza.  And comparing school shooting victims (innocent) to people who actively did something naughty (and went to prison for it) is about as indefensible as you can get.  https://t.co/qMPOxGN2oL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DepressedBrowns @Sissy3469 @maddow Dumbass, there is no cure for the #coronavirus and 97% (give or take) of people will be just fine.  More prisoners probably die from shanking.  I'm sorry if your emotional grandstanding clouds rational thought.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maddow Sad that after MONTHS staff at nursing homes still have no clue how to do their jobs.  How much do these idiots make?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hoping_raging @islandtex @TedNesi @GovRaimondo Define the phrase "Emotional grandstanding".  See above tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sissy3469 @maddow And an overwhelming majority of them will be just fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maddow That's still a lower infection rate than any Walmart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anthagiox @SteveRustad1 I would think anyone with an IQ above room temperature would know that #coronavirus deaths cannot be pinned to one party or another.  Present company excluded, of course. #TDS  https://t.co/87FTfktDDu<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pinkbOnO @lovehealing8 @commonsense258 @CNNPolitics #Pandemic or car crash.  It makes no difference.  If more people die on a stretch of highway, the speed limit is REDUCED BY 5-10 mph.  They DONT lower it to 5 or 10 mph.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBC10_Patrice @NBC10 @GovRaimondo LOL.  Children and people with certain medical conditions CAN STILL SPREAD #coronavirus .  Even I know that.  Just like germs spread at Walmart the same way they spread at Jim's mom and pop store.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nbc10_brian @NBC10 @GovRaimondo "try"? We are "trying" things now?  What the hell has our Governor been doing for the last month?  Funny.  She had no problem shutting down the economy from day one. Maybe "try" a different approach.🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhatIsPrivate1 @Norsu2 @TedNesi @RIHEALTH @GovRaimondo Maybe they don't even know they have hypertension or asthma.  I would assume both of those have varying levels of severity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nbc10_brian @NBC10 @GovRaimondo Did she say if you can be arrested for not wearing a mask in public?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ross1983H I voted for this guy...  https://t.co/L5MKBYCkF6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Norsu2 @WhatIsPrivate1 @TedNesi @RIHEALTH @GovRaimondo Yes, the WorldoMeter breakdown of the #coronacirus deaths was from April 14 in New York City.  I would like to see a current one for Rhode Island but can't find one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andredursin @WhatIsPrivate1 @TedNesi @RIHEALTH That's right.  Everyday life carries a risk.  7,200 people die EV-ER-Y DAY in the USA (pop clocks say 1 death every 12 seconds) before this #coronavirus came about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhatIsPrivate1 @TedNesi @RIHEALTH Mortality rates for everyone (I think) (on March 3 by the WHO) for #coronavirus were 3.4%.  Obviously, it is old data.  That puts us at 34,000 deaths for Rhode Island.  From a #pandemic perspective, we are still getting off easy considering it could have been another Ebola.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhatIsPrivate1 @TedNesi @RIHEALTH My gut (which is not backed by scientists) says 5 times as many cases(at least) that are reported.  There are just too many asymptomatic people testing positive.  And we can't even get those rates accurately because so many PEOPLE DONT REALIZE THEY HAVE IT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhatIsPrivate1 @TedNesi @RIHEALTH An increase in ICUs is going to happen no matter if it's the flu or #coronavirus when more and more people catch it.  We CAN see  how many people are in the ICU.  What we CANT see is all the people infected but having ZERO symptoms.  There is no  measurement for that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhatIsPrivate1 @TedNesi @RIHEALTH That's because the #coronavirus is more widespread than thought.  The problem (if you can call it one) is that the virus is so mild for most of us, we don't realize we are carrying it around.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wbz @TimWhiteRI The funny part is the cost of doing this could be assigned as part of the #coronavirus pandemic response and be part of "funding" and a way to wrestle more taxpayer money into "underfunded" healthcare programs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@secupp New rule:. If you have a net worth of $5,000,000 or more, you can't bitch about people trying to earn a living despite the #coronavirus fears.  Please isolate in your ivory tower and shut the fuck up.  Thank you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KimberlyforIowa #ThankATeacher ?  Why?  You have a (unionized) group of people churning out a worsening product every year (children's test scores) and you not only want us to thank them but also give them a raise?  That makes NO SENSE.  https://t.co/HZeTYt4GO1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBC10 Odd🤔..  According to the state government,  people shopping at Walmart couldn't transmit the #coronavirus but people at a small business could.🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBC10 @NBC10_Parker Waste of money if you ask me(which you didn't).  From what I've read and seen on the internets, the #coronavirus is MORE WIDESPREAD THAN WE THINK and its symptoms are too mild for most of us PLUS it's easily transmitted.  Money better spent on isolating elderly till vaccine IMO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdAnzore @ShannonBream I am pretty sure it is just the way the CDC handles the data.  The media is big on the TOTAL number of #Coronavirus deaths, while the CDC (a guess) is more concerned with weekly deaths.  It's hard work considering 7,200 people die EVERY DAY in USA before this virus even started.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdAnzore @ShannonBream Yes.  I was wondering the same thing.  I am trying to find a breakdown of fatalities by age and I came across the CDC web site.  The numbers are a lot lower than other websites.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DanJaehnig This should have been done weeks ago instead of the whole "Stay at home, count the dead"  mantra being beaten into our heads as the ONLY solution to #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBC10 I actually agree with this, somewhat.  I think we should require masks(or cloth coverings) in public.  Isolate the elderly and weak.  And #OPENAMERICANOW .  That's my idea how to battle #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jtbrg The blame is on the governor.  He shut down the businesses.  Landlords are not to blame for any of this.  And your idea of everyone cancelling debt and taxing the billionaires to make up for it is beyond retarded.🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jtbrg #CancelRent ? If you only worked as hard obtaining and keeping employment 🙄.  And if your looking for someone to blame for jobs disappearing, talk to your Governor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GailmWentworth @RIprobz I would like to point out, the TENS OF MILLIONS figure is based on a UN report for people WORLDWIDE.  Not just the US.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GailmWentworth @RIprobz Um, actually you are telling people they aren't important by cheering the govt on with their business closures.  30 million people cannot earn a living now.  TENS OF MILLIONS are going to die if we continue on this course.  I think they are important as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MatthewDLehman @PoliticallyKyle @glennbeck No, we don't agree it's easily accessible. It is for me, but the nightly news programs do not  report it.  Which was the entire point of my original post here.🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MatthewDLehman @PoliticallyKyle @glennbeck I watch the evening news every night.  They don't announce recoveries.  However,  I can find recovery stats easily on the internet.  A responsible news program would showcase the recoveries as well to let people know the whole picture.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonatha93638429 @PoliticallyKyle @glennbeck Yes.  64,000 deaths during a time period (2 months -and that's being generous) when 432,000 people die in a normal year.  The wash post ran an article on the 12th showing 83% of the first 458 #coronavirus deaths are people over 60.  If you have more up-to-date info, please share.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GailmWentworth @RIprobz 30 million people who are now out of work may disagree with you.  And the TENS OF MILLIONS that are going to die (130 million THIS YEAR if you believe the UN) because of our economic inactivity may see things a bit differently.  Isolate the elderly and weak.  Wear masks in public<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eli_Sherman @wpri12 I don't see why this is coming as a surprise to you (or anyone for that matter).  Given the amount of local businesses that have been shut down by the state government in it's response to the #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GailmWentworth @RIprobz By that retarded logic, we would be lowering speed limits to 10mph due to highway deaths.  We don't.  We lower them by 5 or 10 mph if more deaths occur than usual.  To instruct an entire society to hide indoors indefinitely based on fear of #coronavirus  is equally stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GregAbbott_TX Every month is Military appreciation month for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MatthewDLehman @PoliticallyKyle @glennbeck Wrong.  It IS left out.  Also left out are the amount of recoveries.  The death count is plastered ev-er-y where on the evening news as the recovery count is seldom mentioned.  Also not mentioned is a statistical breakdown of who exactly is dying from #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MatthewDLehman @everbodyBlocksU @PoliticallyKyle @glennbeck There is a difference between doing what we can do, in a responsible manner, to prevent #coronavirus spread and going overboard based on fear.  What you are suggesting is akin to lowering the national speed limit to 10mph due to highway deaths.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@everbodyBlocksU @TheOris77 @joemacmichen @BriBriSpiegs @PoliticallyKyle @glennbeck Reports are coming out that the first cases of #Coronavirus  were in January.  If we put that 60,000 in perspective. There were 7,200 deaths and 9,600 births PER DAY in the US before all this (pop clock).  We are a nation of 329,000,000(+/-).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@speakeasy602 @PoliticallyKyle @glennbeck It's been more than 6 weeks.  Reports are coming out that the first cases were in January.  And to put that 60,000 in perspective. There was 1 death every 12 seconds (7,200 per day) in the US before the #Coronavirus (pop clock).  We are a nation of 329,000,000(+/-).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonatha93638429 @PoliticallyKyle @glennbeck I didn't say that.  I was pointing out that the overwhelming majority of people that are infected with #coronavirus will be absolutely fine.  And its so mild that some will get it, recover from it, and never even knew they had it.  Unless you have evidence to the contrary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyTheBean @ElectBlakeMoore Actually, it was peaceful.  There were 0 shots fired.  No pics (that I can find) of protesters pointing their weapons at anyone.  There was ONE arrest (protester fighting with another-LOL). No damage. However, IMO they should've worn masks and not shouted in cops faces. #COVID19<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheOris77 @joemacmichen @BriBriSpiegs @everbodyBlocksU @PoliticallyKyle @glennbeck Well then you get the flu for that year.  Nothing more.  There is never a guarantee even if you get the correct one.  About half of the people (45% according to google) get flu shots every year.   I don't get them.  Some years I get the flu, most years I don't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Darn.  I didn't get the memo.  I didn't know it was #whiteprivilege day on twitter.  I thought Thursdays were  #Equality day and #LGBTQ day was switched with #MedicareForAll day after Bernie got knocked out of the primary.  Last update I got was #MeToo day replaced with #UBI day.  https://t.co/jdO6gWajMW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheOris77 @joemacmichen @BriBriSpiegs @everbodyBlocksU @PoliticallyKyle @glennbeck If you Google "what does a flu shot do", it basically says the flu shot is a vaccine.  Unless I'm reading it wrong.  Which is possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yaf I don't know names of weapons but the weapon in the video looks a lot like the type of weapons I used to shoot trap with at my friends hunting cabin.  One of them had two barrels.  I don't remember what they were called but I don't think it was AR-15.🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@everbodyBlocksU @oshekay2 @PoliticallyKyle @glennbeck If there's money in it,  greed sneaks in.  Human nature 101.  And if you think the medical community is immune to greed, I got an estimated $50,000,000,000 per year in medicare fraud that says you're wrong.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@oshekay2 @everbodyBlocksU @PoliticallyKyle @glennbeck You have a good point.

<|startoftext|>@everbodyBlocksU @PoliticallyKyle @glennbeck TENS OF MILLIONS will die (130 million THIS YEAR according to the U.N.) if we continue on the current course.  That is worse than the #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@everbodyBlocksU @BriBriSpiegs @PoliticallyKyle @glennbeck First off, the entire nation isn't on lockdown.  Secondly, the virus isn't going anywhere soon.  There is no cure yet. So, whether you lift the "lockdown" today stay home forever, the #coronavirus deaths will continue.  If you want to save lives, isolate the elderly and weak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@speakeasy602 @PoliticallyKyle @glennbeck The statistics for #coronavirus are available on multiple web sites.  Perhaps you should check one out.  It's free.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@everbodyBlocksU @PoliticallyKyle @glennbeck Sorry, snowflake. Apparently no one had "the talk" with you. Grown ups accept death.  We don't like it,but it's a part of life.

<|startoftext|>@Amy_Siskind @JeriLRyan There is no cure for the virus.  It doesn't matter who the President is, they cannot cure the #coronavirus .  It is easily transmitted.

<|startoftext|>@DISTRICTS909 @4lifeChris420 @TwerkWhitIt See what the astronauts do.  They are up in space and basically quarantined for months.  And they do it all the time.  See if NASA has any guidance on re-adjusting to earth's germs.<|endoftext|>

However, the #coronavirus is either going to kill you, or it's not.  Doesn't matter if you shelter for 1 day or a year.  There is no treatment for it yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovRaimondo The #coronavirus deaths are going to spike whether we #OpenUp tomorrow or in 2 months.  There is NO CURE and with it's ease of transmission plus the amount of asymptomatic positives, it's not going anywhere soon.

<|startoftext|>@littlejackie66 @CMWooly @maddow I respect that and I wish him the best with his decision.  But how are the employees going to get by with the stores closed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ygrene [me resisting the urge to ask his opinion on kumquats]:  https://t.co/s0muRk9IEK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@littlejackie66 @CMWooly @maddow I agree antibody tests are great.  But you are dealing with a new strain and there aren't answers to if someone is still susceptible to it again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@littlejackie66 @CMWooly @maddow Well, if your son gets hungry enough he may change his mind.  How long can he stay closed?  There won't be a vaccine for awhile.  And the virus is going to continue to spread in the meantime.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CMWooly @littlejackie66 @maddow You aren't going to get to "safe" as I explained earlier.  The #coronavirus is TOO MILD FOR TOO MANY PEOPLE to keep it contained.  How do you think it spread so easily?  A lot (25-50% depending on who you ask) of people won't even know they ever had it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@littlejackie66 @CMWooly @maddow Testing becomes a moot point when more and more asymptomatic people are walking around with the virus.  You can't test everyone, every day.  Reserve tests for healthcare workers and care givers.  Only test the general public if they have symptoms. Isolate the vulnerable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CMWooly @littlejackie66 @maddow It's not fair to the "non-essential" workers (a vague description at best) to have their businesses shut down.  They can't go earn a living now.  That's not fair at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@littlejackie66 @CMWooly @maddow @realDonaldTrump The back of the #coronavirus guidelines Trump sent out.  https://t.co/JccSZe0GGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@littlejackie66 @CMWooly @maddow I got this in the mail awhile back from @realDonaldTrump about the #coronavirus .  Would this be considered an unwavering message?  https://t.co/5YBmuU561I<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CMWooly @littlejackie66 @maddow We are going to have to open up the economy eventually and be prepared for more waves of deaths.  We cannot continue like this much longer.  Unless a cure/vaccine can be found.  And that doesn't look promising.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@littlejackie66 @CMWooly @maddow Yes.  Most responsible people take precautions.  Agree 💯%.  So how about we require masks in public places and social distancing and let the people decide.  That seems fair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CMWooly @littlejackie66 @maddow Yes, if everyone followed the rules, we'd have fewer deaths.  Couldn't argue that if I wanted.  So how about, we allow everyone to go about their business but require masks and social distancing?  Would that be a fair compromise?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maddow So, continue as normal. 1) Stay at home. 2) Count the dead. 3) Blame Trump for the #coronavirus and hope the rotten economy sinks him in November with the #coronavirusBlameGame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CMWooly @littlejackie66 @maddow So, why aren't flu vaccine shots mandatory for our day to day lives every single year? Nobody has ever ordered me to get one. You'd save many lives every flu season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CMWooly @littlejackie66 @maddow Maybe not.  But other people's bad behavior (drunk driving, texting, reckless, "kids having fun", etc..) causes others to needlessly die.  Every day.  It's a risk we are willing to take.  Every day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@littlejackie66 @CMWooly @maddow Will we be reducing the speed limit to 10 mph on the highways?  We had 38,000 people killed on them last year and 4.5 MILLION people required medical attention because of it.  That would help those I love, alive.  But, it's a RISK people take every single day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CMWooly @littlejackie66 @maddow If 25 to 50 percent (depending on who you ask) of the people that have the #coronavirus  don't even realize they have it, then they have already been swimming through the poop and spreading it.  And you will never get no new cases.  We get 500,000 flu deaths every single season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotSwagy @stinkytcat1 @DLoesch Actually, I am enjoying the Irony and hypocrisy of the left who have been telling illegal immigrants for decades to ignore the rules and do whatever they want.  Funny how both sides have completely flipped.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JeriLRyan They way people blame Trump for all these deaths, one might say "that with almost half of the #coronavirus deaths for the country coming from his state, Andrew Cuomo sucks as a leader".  But I wouldn't.  That wouldn't be right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theKlutzyKatze @QuinnTSential @MaryRobakowski @theLegacyPrep #commonsense is that you don't quarantine everyone when 25-50% of the people that get the #coronavirus DON'T EVEN KNOW THEY HAVE IT because the symptoms are so mild if they show up at all.  Quarantine the nursing homes is your best shot.  Not everyone else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Votersspeaknow @QuinnTSential @MaryRobakowski @theLegacyPrep Actually, they are risking their lives for food.  They are risking their lives to maintain their standard of living.

<|startoftext|>@QuinnTSential @MaryRobakowski @theLegacyPrep No, I think people are really getting sick and tired of loafing about.   You have to remember Trump's base.

<|startoftext|>@DevinMcloud @Tyeesalmon_ @NickEmmonsTV The government did it.  So that means it probably cost about $150,000,000.00 and it will be listed as #coronavirus expenses and an argument for more healthcare funding.😏<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EEFaulk @BluGrsBonnyLass @travisakers A lot of assumptions in there.  I keep asking for any evidence you have to support your earlier claim about the Feb 2008 stimulus bill.

<|startoftext|>@EEFaulk @BluGrsBonnyLass @travisakers Sure, I'll engage.  Please provide any evidence you may have (I haven't found any) that the 2008 Feb stimulus act had any intent of "helping American cope with a financial collapse".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EEFaulk @BluGrsBonnyLass @travisakers I'm not trying to give you anything.

<|startoftext|>@EEFaulk @BluGrsBonnyLass @travisakers You work.  You go out to earn money to live.  The Government SHUTS DOWN the business where you work (in this case, because it has not been deemed "essential").  What part of that is confusing you?🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EEFaulk @BluGrsBonnyLass @travisakers Had you referenced the 2009 stimulus that Obama passed, I would agree with you.  The event already happened.

<|startoftext|>@EEFaulk @BluGrsBonnyLass @travisakers You're simply trying to rewrite history to support your incorrect statement earlier about the bill passed in early 2008 as something that was helping people "cope with a financial collapse".

<|startoftext|>@DogeCommon @SenWarren @RepRoKhanna I wasn't talking exclusively about doctors.  Learn to read.

<|startoftext|>@DogeCommon @SenWarren @RepRoKhanna Oh please.  These people are making money hand over fist with all the overtime.  The AVERAGE Doctor salary in Boston, MA is $311,322 (salary dotcom).  Let the doctors stick a crow bar in their wallets and chip in.<|endoftext|>

I just figured it was a two-way street<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hey_ebie @amberpages_g @CBSNews It's about you posting misleading information (be it intentionally or by mistake or laziness).  You begin a tweet claiming this person is bad and reference a quote to support your opinion.  That quote never happened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KingRJ22 @lennoxesq @DavidDTSS I respectfully disagree.  In my opinion, if you want to be part of a society, you have to SHARE your culture.  All of it.

<|startoftext|>@TaniaBradkin @kbrackson @Diedre09 @latimesopinion @RepKatiePorter Before I bought my house, the literature I read at the time indicated that your mortgage payment should be 25% of your gross monthly income.  That's what I went by.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amberpages_g @hey_ebie @CBSNews Very nice.  I hate quahogs but love the reference.👍 What is up my ass(I'm not demanding anything, btw): She posts a headline that is wrong.  The guy (Mr. Adams) didn't say what was in the quoted text of her tweet.  That's what's up my ass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaniaBradkin @Diedre09 @latimesopinion @RepKatiePorter Yes, my bio indicates I voted for Trump in '16 and will in '20.

<|startoftext|>@KingRJ22 @lennoxesq @DavidDTSS I get that response often.  I'm white.  I'm not allowed to talk about it.  If that's the way you feel, I won't press the nigga word issue.

<|startoftext|>@hey_ebie Well yes I have, thank you.

<|startoftext|>@hey_ebie Unless the NAACP has changed recently, they are part of the problem, IMO.  Big money groups such as these can (and do) pervert what would otherwise be a noble endeavor, IMO.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hey_ebie Why are you posting false stuff about the US Surgeon General?  He didn't say what you insinuated in your headline.  So, what is it that you are trying to convey to everyone?  And you can still do that without besmirching the distinguished Mr. Adams.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hey_ebie @CBSNews At the very least, they would watch the video and form their own opinion before blindly posting it.  #FakeNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hey_ebie @CBSNews So, you trying to shrug it off as “It was CBS that did it, not me”, just doesn’t cut the mustard.  You are trying to advance a false narrative.  An “activist” that is on the level, would RESEARCH what it is they are posting...(cont)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hey_ebie @CBSNews (I don’t know what forced vomit means) adds to his lack of credibility. However, The video (the man actually speaking as well as the words on the screen) show NOTHING as to what the headline is referring to.  In fact, the headline (your headline) is completely misleading..(cont)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hey_ebie @CBSNews That quote is in YOUR text area.  If you are going to allow an app to put words in your text area and then blindly hit “send”, you own them, sweetheart.  You set an agenda.  Stating the US Surgeon General is DISPARAGING his own culture.  Stating how he is insincere..(cont).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ben17Aroundo @Rosie No.  You the rock that is dumb(and blind).  I said ILLEGAL immigrants.  Plus, I didn't say to send anybody anywhere.  I simply pointed out that gleefully allowing ILLEGAL immigrants is NOT going to help with all the "poverty" in this country.  That's just #CommonSense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hey_ebie @CBSNews No.  YOUR tweet had in quotes “"US surgeon general says Black and Latino Americans should 'step up,' avoid alcohol, tobacco, and drugs””  The CBS video clip, or any of the words on the screen of the clip DID NOT HAVE THAT STATEMENT.  Sorry, but this is as fake as it gets. #Fraud  https://t.co/4NC2esO9b5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SaveThePostOffice   Sorry, but I think the #USPS needs a revamp.  While I love their flat-rate box deals, the need for communication and business via paper is shrinking.

<|startoftext|>@MobRules2020 One of the few things that has upset me over the last few decades is our trade agreement with communist China.  They OPPRESS their people and the rest of the world, 🤪.

<|startoftext|>@hey_ebie He didn't say that.  He said to avoid tobacco alcohol and drugs.  He said the "step up" part in a different part of the clip.  He said you need to step up and help stop the spread.  You are making it sound like something he didn't say.  #FakeNews<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jsyd1 {Forbes} Raising a pitchfork to fight Amazon's corporate tax breaks is fine if the argument is rooted in strong economic reasoning. The risk is that too often the data is pulled out of context, and inaccurate stories circling that data gain momentum and undeservedly accelerate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jsyd1 The reason.... Investment in Property, Plant, and Equipment. Amazon’s investment in property, plant, and equipment also makes it eligible for tax creditsAmazon's PPE expenditure has steadily increased over the last five years, netting to approximately $60 billion as of 2017.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jsyd1 And the reason.... [From Forbes] Investment in Research &amp; Development. Amazon invests heavily in research and development and therefore benefits from the tax credit. In 2017, Amazon topped the list of U.S. companies in R&amp;D spend, at $22.6 billion.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RussOnPolitics @peterbakernyt I don't mean to interrupt your celebration of people suffering.  But Trump didn't shut down businesses in Rhode Island.  Our Governor did that.  She is Democrat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jsyd1 What rights don't women have that men do?  Corporations don't exist without customers who freely patronize them.  What rights don't gays have?  And the voter suppression card is played ev-er-y year to the point where it is as cliche as the false racism narrative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trumpthruages @eirenicon @GrassrootsSpeak Agreed.  People can't save.  We have to keep up with all the new streaming services and phones. PlayStation games cost a fortune.  Have you seen how much they charge for tattoos?  And don't get me started on alcohol and dope prices.😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrassrootsSpeak People in my state lost their jobs because our governor shut down their businesses. Our governor did not shut down healthcare so those people still have jobs.  The GOP didn't come into Rhode Island and shut down businesses.  Our governor did.  Our governor is a Democrat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TIME From what I've seen reported, the #coroanvirus seems to be only affecting men and women.  The other genders haven't reported a single case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jsyd1 How is the GOP oppressing us?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aSexyPineapple @TIME The "but Hillary" line is perfectly apt here.  She was a HUGE favorite to win.  I bet her early (Feb 2016) and got greats odds (+125 at the time).  She was over -400(if memory serves) in November.  Never been happier to lose a bet in my life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aSexyPineapple @TIME Go to Bovada.  Trump is at -120 and Biden is at +120.  Trump is the favorite there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aSexyPineapple @TIME Hillary was a huge favorite to win in 2016 and that didn't end the way it was supposed to.   And Trump is still the favorite (albeit slight) to win right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OkayResignTho @maddow They got test sites all over the place here in Rhode Island.  I don't plan on getting one unless I get sick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenWarren @EPA @EPAAWheeler Cheap, reliable energy is very important.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nicqi001 @moriya2k2 @SoftnCutethings @keet0007 I liked Obama also but this story is akin to Godzilla destroying Tokyo but apologizing for an overdue library book. Of course, if I thought Obamacare was a good idea, I would agree with you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Christo77267257 @vampireontitus @realDonaldTrump @narendramodi No.  If you light them and hold them sideways, tikki torches are great for enforcing #SocialDistanacing rules during rallies as well as the grocery store.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Christo77267257 @vampireontitus @realDonaldTrump @narendramodi No, I was on Amazon shopping for tikki torches.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowaydu91891568 @vampireontitus @realDonaldTrump @narendramodi Yep.  And I'm gonna vote for it again. Unless, the @DNC has some other candidate we don't know about yet.🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods I remember a whistleblower from the #metoo movement.....🤔  https://t.co/dv9j9W78sT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GHS @judbrewer I avoid anxiety spiral by keeping things in perspective.  Viruses have been attacking us longer then we've been walking upright.    World population is over 7,700,000,000.  There have been 14,000,000+ deaths so far this year and 30,000,000+ births.  I am thinking we will be okay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GHS @DrTedros @WHO Too late.  According to the @DNC here in America, it's ALL Trump's fault people are dying from the #coronavirus .  They've been saying it for awhile now.  ☹️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maddow As of today, the USA has tested more people than any other country...by over a million.    My question is, what are these other countries hiding?  Why won't they test their citizens for #coronavirus like Trump is doing? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IAmJulesWard @maddow So, I am guessing the leaderships of Spain, France, Italy, the UK all ignored their briefings as well?  And did it in purpose?  https://t.co/0om5RIfzWQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotATweeter16 @SenWarren According to WorldoMeter, as of today, the USA has tested the most people of ANY country.......by over a million.🤔.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nicqi001 @moriya2k2 @SoftnCutethings @keet0007 Then your answer is "never" because such a person has never been President.☹️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBC10_Sam @NBC10 Sounds good.  Are they looking for workers?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Craig1Kennedy @vampireontitus @realDonaldTrump @narendramodi I don't have a crystal ball.  All I know is I'm voting for Trump (again).  I didn't think he'd win last time.  Never been so happy to be wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CandyComedy I seem to remember a running count of how many days candidate Hillary didn't hold a press conference during her campaign.  Perhaps she is not unlike "The Donald" after all?🤷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WillemsAngie @JanelleRouthier @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump @narendramodi According to that, it looks like Trump has personally saved 22,184 lives. I bet that number goes up.   Not bad for a "Con artist".🤓<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MarkAll65984731 @FACEatelier @maddow Agreed.  We need scientists.  Unfortunately, a great many of them have been otherwise occupied the last few years worshipping a teenager with a political agenda.  https://t.co/ecgfOL3EN3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@moriya2k2 @nicqi001 @SoftnCutethings @keet0007 Japan has been doing something right.  For a country of 125,000,000 people crammed onto an island, they had a deaths per million rate of 0.7 (yep, less than 1).  Amazing. They bow (don't shake hands) and take their shoes off when entering a home. That culture helps I would think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nicqi001 @moriya2k2 @SoftnCutethings @keet0007 I'm curious.  When would it NOT BE DANGEROUS to listen to the President and believe (or agree with) what comes out of their mouth?🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GabrielaBustelo Yes.  Very sad.  Some countries are getting hit really hard.  Only thing we can do is try to keep the #coronavirus away from vulnerable people.  I'm not in a high risk group but I also don't want to spread it to others.  So I #SocialDistance as much as I can.  Stay safe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GabrielaBustelo You have me at a disadvantage as I don't understand the language in your tweet. I only know English (more or less).  I assume it is about Spain and I hope things get better there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Seiginot0ra @scharlie8408 @IlhanMN Democrats in a nutshell: Here is free shit!  Vote for us over the evil rich people.  Nevermind the fact we have as much money, if not more.🤷  https://t.co/H6a2TUfyqm<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@UIntellect007 @nmlinarez17 @Nem_Nova @AOC I will vote for Trump in November but on this subject, I disagree with him(and you).  I like NOT having an official language (or religion).  In my mind, THAT is freedom, baby!  And I'm all for any immigrants AS LONG AS THEY COME HERE LEGALLY.  Come on in!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KirstenPowers Did other countries also have Intel reports in November?  If our Intel knew, maybe others did as well.  Because this seems to be happening in other countries.🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovRaimondo The "Bank robber" look is trending these days.  I think I know why.  I disagree with a lot of what you are doing but I do wish you and your family stay safe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UIntellect007 @nmlinarez17 @Nem_Nova @AOC The United States of America has no official language. Never has.  I like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nmlinarez17 @Nem_Nova @AOC I think you meant to say "Their funding of our teacher's unions".   Which has failed miserably in educating our children.  There are no benefits to a public education these days.  Unions saw to that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC So, basically more free shit for illegal immigrants.  And I'd be happy to return EV-ER-Y DIME of the supposed taxes they have paid providing THEY ALSO MAKE RESTITUTION for services rendered by our governments.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nicqi001 @moriya2k2 @SoftnCutethings @keet0007 It means we are stacking body bags just like a lot of other countries.  What Trump (or any other leader) says is irrelevant.  If you want solutions to the problem, look to countries that are handling it better(like Japan).  But they probably have a DIFFERENT CULTURE than us, so🤷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ygrene I relish this type of humor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@riyad314 @Katy98308133 Actually, there are people you can talk to about it.  Perhaps, the people THAT BROUGHT THEM HERE might have insight as to HOW THEY GOT HERE and why?  Just saying if you want to get to the root cause of the problem🤔. #CommonSense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@moriya2k2 @SoftnCutethings @keet0007 Who is "we"?  The Spanish?  French?  The Italians?  Germany's? UK? Doesn't look like a lot of countries were prepared for #coronavirus .  Even the Utopian socialist states with their marvelous "free" healthcare systems so much better than ours🤔 are stacking body bags to the sky.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chaconkie This isn't the #coronavirus explained easily.  It is fear mongering.  That is a sign you'd show to a 10 year old   An EXPLANATION would simply state (based on what we know) WHAT IT IS,  WHAT IT HAS DONE and what we think IT MIGHT DO TO PEOPLE if contracted.  https://t.co/429tBz1fCn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrazzledWhy @ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump @ainsleyearhardt @foxandfriends Yes, I remember the news cycle at the time.  Kobe Kobe Kobe!  NFL playoffs!  Impeachment!

<|startoftext|>@MahdaouiRashad @SenWarren @RepPressley @HHSGov Wasn't trying to be funny.

So, the question remains....How the hell do you know what other peoples' interests are?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ringle_sandra Ummm.  You have conflicting hashtags.  How can you tell people to simultaneously #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica and #fuckthegovernment at the same time?  And if America does turn blue do we still fuck the government?  So many questions.  https://t.co/IU1JSdoYOb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MahdaouiRashad @SenWarren @RepPressley @HHSGov How the hell do you know what other black peoples' interests are?  Or anyone's interests for that matter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenWarren @RepPressley @HHSGov Yes, all those temporary hospitals the #BlackLivesMatter people have put up show they really care and the evil white man obviously does not.🤦<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovRaimondo How do you expect people to "follow the rules we've put in place" when you have spent your career as governor telling people to IGNORE the rules(laws) we've put in place? #CommonSense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CandyComedy @morganwrightTV @NexstarDC @nexstar You sound upset.  Have a snack.  Maybe watch some Netflix and chill?  #TDS  https://t.co/V6g51YN6pm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@morganwrightTV @NexstarDC @nexstar From the world population clock.  Deaths this year over 15,000,000 Births this year   over 37,000,000 Births today 242,000+ Deaths today 101,000+ We've had a population growth of over 21,700,000 people this year. I'm not downplaying the #coronavirus , just pointing out the data.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Heather99794314 @naimeiyao @BarackObama @cecmunoz Italy has more deaths and a much lower population. Deaths per million...

<|startoftext|>Who got closer to the Oval office in 2020?  Stephanie Grisham or Hillary Clinton?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Dents6679 @tweetMalena Give Trump credit for the recovered as well as the millions that didn't even contract the #coronavirus due to his "Stable Genius" leadership(lol) and then you can lay the blame of the dead squarely on his shoulders.

<|startoftext|>@nbc10_brian @NBC10 @GovRaimondo Unemployment back in 2008 was due to economic factors.  Today's unemployment filings are due to @GovRaimondo closing the businesses she chose to shut down.  Nothing more.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PontificatingS @mcuban Theres the Crux of the problem.  Society is still willing to pay money to watch someone put a ball through a hoop.  Or hit a ball with a bat.  Or run with a ball to the endzone.  And some of those tickets cost hundreds of dollars.  End that and you'll end the high salaries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dvergano Doesn't a plague specifically mean a bacterium spread from rats to humans by way of flea bites?  Which is much different than what we are up against now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PontificatingS @mcuban I would think a doctor, teacher, policeman, fireman, first responder and even a garbage collector would generate more value to a  society than simply watching someone put a ball through a hoop.🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mcuban Not sure what America 2.0 will be, but I would hope it's NOT a society that pays people an average of $7,700,000 per year to simply put a ball through a hoop. 🤔🤔🤔 #CommonSense<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BLPMA @jojosmith65_jo @ProudResister And that makes him different from ANY OTHER PRESIDENT how??  If you are going to insist we assign all the blame to a single person, you must also credit that same person for the accomplishments.  Trump could've fired Dr. Fauci years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@strat_nick @TIME Furthermore, you have 50 state governments and some territories to consider.  They all have a hand in things as well.  After all, it's called the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA for a reason.🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@strat_nick @TIME LOL.  I have no idea how my "Dear Leader" (technically it's OUR leader) thinks.  Nor, do I care.  My point was (is) the President cannot simply flip a switch and make the economy good or bad.  There are 535(ish) other ass clowns in the  Legislative Branch that have a hand in it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@strat_nick @TIME Cute.  Now, lay down the Congressional makeup next to those data points, then you will learn who controlled the House of Representatives as well as the Senate.  And Congress must pass legislation as well as spending (Government 101).   So, you lose.  But hey, thanks for playing.  https://t.co/D570SQ9oDI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@strat_nick @TIME My condolences as they apparently stopped teaching civics.  No worries, you can Google how our governments are structured. Bonus Hint: if you Google "Historical Congressional Majorities", you will have an "A-Ha" moment😮 when you lay that data down next to economic swings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@strat_nick @TIME Sounds like someone's still a wee bit butt-hurt over the 2016 election.   Apparently the #coroanvirus doesn't affect #TDS 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BLPMA @jojosmith65_jo @ProudResister Well, by that same measurement you would then have to credit Trump for the recoveries as well as the people who avoided contacting the #CoronavirusUSA due to our President's "stable genius" leadership.😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GHS @CDCgov Wrong.  #COVID19 hasn't left 10 million Americans unemployed.  The governments (mostly state) responses to the virus are what's causing the unemployment.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BLPMA @jojosmith65_jo @ProudResister The number of deaths is irrelevant.  I believe the point she was trying to make is that Twitter wasn't going bat-shit crazy blaming Obama for the swine flu like people who are blaming Trump for the #coronavirus today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GWR Now THAT is a record worthy of celebration.  Congratulations to Bob Weighton.😀<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@moved2italy @maddow Lemme ask.  You gonna thank Trump for all the people that recovered from the #CoronavirusPandemic as well as the people who did not get infected at all?  If yes, then great. Otherwise, shut yo mouf.  https://t.co/Of8vXZgLoK<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AOC Um, the unemployment rate is soaring because Federal, state and local governments are CLOSING BUSINESSES.  So, you want the government to solve a problem that governments created?  You have just become a main stream Democrat.  Congratulations.😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BastardSon__ @DixieNoormous @LauraWhorley @ravenstang2020 @AustinKellerman @FOX16News @JohnsHopkins Or, maybe the South Korean culture is different than the USA?

<|startoftext|>@LastGreatAct @GovRaimondo You do realize that if EVERYONE would heed the general advice being dispensed (aka #CommonSense ), then the need for testing on the general population for the #coronavirus  would be reduced considerably.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mojoRis82970268 @glennbeck @DrREpstein @realDonaldTrump You can come up with a pretty damn good estimate by seeing who the virus kills.

<|startoftext|>@goodnu @glennbeck @DrREpstein @realDonaldTrump It doesn't matter who has it and who doesn't.  80% of the people will breeze through it.  You quarantine only the people that are susceptible to it until vaccines or a remedy (good luck) can be found.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mojoRis82970268 @glennbeck @DrREpstein @realDonaldTrump I never said the virus was equal.  What I have said over and over and over is that 80% of people that contract the #coronavirus will experience mild flu-like symptoms.  Some will have the virus and NOT EVEN KNOW IT.  And it is easily transmittable between humans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mojoRis82970268 @glennbeck @DrREpstein @realDonaldTrump No, but I can read and interpret data.  80% of the people who get the #coronavirus will see mild flu-like symptoms.  Some people have ZERO symptoms.  The virus is transmitted via droplets that come out your nose and or mouth and can remain on surfaces for DAYS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mojoRis82970268 @glennbeck @DrREpstein @realDonaldTrump Out of context.  It means to take something without the surrounding words or circumstances.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mojoRis82970268 @glennbeck @DrREpstein @realDonaldTrump I know the facts.  And simply taking statements from others out of context does not mean that you do also.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mojoRis82970268 @glennbeck @DrREpstein @realDonaldTrump Fact: 80% of the people who have the #coronavirus will experience mild flu-like symptoms.  Some people have the virus and HAVE ZERO SYMPTOMS.  They didn't even know they had it.  You are putting the cart before the horse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jenbrea @glennbeck @DrREpstein @realDonaldTrump When you test someone, it only tells you AT THAT POINT IN TIME whether the person is infected. Immediately after the test, the same person can contract the virus walking into the next room.  Congratulations, your test has accomplished nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jenbrea @glennbeck @DrREpstein @realDonaldTrump FACT: People who HAVE THE VIRUS CAN SHOW NO SYMPTOMS.  Unless you were going to test EVERYBODY EVERY SINGLE DAY (and get the results immediately) then this stupid idea WILL NOT WORK.  Much easier to isolate the few.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glennbeck @DrREpstein @realDonaldTrump An even simpler solution would be for those susceptible to the virus to isolate.  Turn the economy back on.  And we could do that immediately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HillaryClinton Hey Hillary.  Just curious how you would handle the #coronavirus if you were President.  Guess we'll never find out.😂  https://t.co/M2JqTUa1rZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TedNesi @wpri12 @CoreyWelch @GovRaimondo I am already sick and tired of hearing about people WHO CAN WORK AND GET PAID,  while THOUSANDS ACROSS THE STATE have had their "Daily jobs" jobs shut down.  Imo, these people aren't  heros.  They are just lucky not to work for a business Gina has shut down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovRaimondo @RIHEALTH FYI: Over/under on how many Rhode Island jobs your actions are going to kill today is 1250'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wpri_feed Is this the program that requires extra paperwork for legal U.S. Citizens to PROVE they are legal U.S. citizens to the Feds because some states are giving drivers licenses to illegal immigrants?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wpri12 State revenues haven't collapsed due to the #coronavirus .  State revenues have collapsed because  our governor is shutting down businesses.  If businesses are closed, they don't generate revenue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lisajean__ @realShawNshawN And most businesses are trying to get by as well.  And, yes the "poor" are irresponsible sometimes.  When I see "poor" people walking out of Walmart with new 60 inch TV's during the #coroanvirus pandemic, I question their judgement as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lisajean__ @realShawNshawN Curious.  Will you also be calling out individuals that take the  $1,200 and buy dope and/or alcohol, lottery tickets, cigarettes, or that Fortnite upgrade that all the other kids have? #coronavirus #CommonSense  https://t.co/8yziWH0PYp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ed_Dexter1995 @GHS Is it the funding or the irresponsible spending?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GHS All of these countries with #HealthForAll or whatever bullshit you want to call it are stacking bodies just as high as the USA is, if not higher.  With this  #coronavirus , us Americans are getting a glimpse of just how shitty universal care is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TedNesi @wpri12 Based on a quick Google search, I found 111 Rhode island state employees that make over $100,000 per year.  I can only imagine how fat their pension plans are on top of that.  Maybe we can finally cut spending to make up for some of the $300,000,000 Gina wants to borrow.🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KimKalunian @wpri12 We keep hearing about the number of people who test POSITIVE for the #coronavirus .  I haven't seen any results pertaining to the number of people testing NEGATIVE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GHS Even when "bills" include streaming services, 800,000 channels of cable, tickets for concerts, sporting events, every copy of Harry Potter ever put on DVD (and again for Blu Ray), video game consoles (and games) and of course, the daily $8 coffee from Starbucks?🤔 Those bills?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erndea @AndAllThatChaz @AOC And we are well on our way now.  Small businesses and a few good sized ones are basically shut down.  Car plants just announced they shutting down.  Amazon is laughing all the way to the bank.  There's your new world.  Amazon and the Federal Government.  And I don't like either🙁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tankgod12 @AndAllThatChaz @AOC You need taxes.  Only a fool (other than me) would argue that.  I love the idea of a flat tax and I would even jump on the progressive bandwagon given the right circumstances.  Let's do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@repetemusic @ginger_snap214 @AOC You mean the 70% on income over $10,000,000 a year that the tippy top make?  Yea, I did a study on the bimbo's plan.  Instantly, the top 100 professional athletes (none of them billionaires) would be paying over 50% to the govt. The tipping point is $16,675,000 (ish).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@repetemusic @ginger_snap214 @AOC 1960 tax revenue      $93,000,000,000  with a population of           179,323,175  2020 tax revenue $3,710,000,000,000(est) with a population of          332,000,000(est)  Fed govt revenues have multiplied FORTY TIMES for a population that hasn't even doubled.  #CommonSense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ginger_snap214 @repetemusic @AOC Everything is based off of culture.  And all laws are the result of that culture.  If the laws aren't accepted by the culture, they don't work.  And high marginal tax rates accomplish one thing with certainty.  They reduce the (take-home) income of the person paying them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@repetemusic @ginger_snap214 @AOC I didn't say that they would.  What I said was that tax codes were written for that era and are a result of that era's culture.  Simply inserting those same tax codes into today's culture, won't make things like they were back then.  Different cultures.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@repetemusic @ginger_snap214 @AOC That's correct.  Things are so much better today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erndea @AndAllThatChaz @AOC Awesome.  I can't wait to see the Utopian society on the other side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>[People today ] We can't make ends meet.  Evil corporations ruin everything, blah blah blah..😫😫  [Same people] When can I pre-order the #PlayStation5 ?😍😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erndea @AndAllThatChaz @AOC Cool.  And I am sure those children can pass all of the regulatory hurdles as well as set up testing facilities as well as rounding up people to test it.  Oh, and then I am sure they can mass produce vaccines in the bathtub.  And insurance, I am sure they are insured.🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ginger_snap214 @AOC No, what I am saying is that you cannot cherry pick a few (partial) stats from one era and insert them into another era and expect the same results.  Different times.  Different cultures.  Different tax codes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ginger_snap214 @AOC The tax code IS a reflection of society and the social issues of the day at the time it was written. And when white men write the tax code so that only white men can prosper, you have EXACTLY what some claim is happening today.  White men keeping everyone else down.  No thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ginger_snap214 @AOC Ah, yes.  Great times🙄.  White  men controlled ev-er-y aspect of our lives.  Women knew their place(in the home). Gays safely tucked away in the closet.  Blacks could be denied service at stores.  Different times and different deductions (like credit card interest).  👎<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AndAllThatChaz @AOC You do realize that it takes (at least) two different countries to engage in a war, right?   And the reason you have all of the modern day luxuries is because of Wall Street and those evil corporations. Unless you tweet using two cans and some string.🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@5five0oh4four Fun fact:. The vocals in the closing theme song from "WKRP in Cincinnati" are gibberish.  And the correct answer to this bracket is Magnum P.I.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Eli_Sherman @wpri12 @Jollelol @TedNesi This makes no sense.  They are crying like children about test kits (in a futile effort to stop the spread) but then won't let people know WHEN THEY ARE AT A GREATER RISK from the #coronavirus  after someone nearby tests positive?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TedNesi @wpri12 @GovRaimondo And place bets on which local businesses she closes today so they get out of @amazon 's way.🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leanleft1 @Soapscum628 @donsmalley79 @ClarckSofia Test kits don't cure the #coronavirus . Test kits can't stop the spread of a virus, esp when it's easily xfered and the symptoms are so mild.  Test kits can't make people practice #CommonSense hygiene and social distancing.  I am guessing you had a public education.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leanleft1 @Soapscum628 @donsmalley79 @ClarckSofia Newsflash.  People are already dropping like flies ALL OVER THE PLANET from the #coronavirus GLOBAL #pandemic . Over 200,000 people WORLDWIDE have it.  Helpful Hint: I put the important words in bold so you can keep up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cmclymer No, this #ChinaLiedPeopleDied isn't garbage, honey.  In case you haven't noticed, this #coronavirus is a GLOBAL #pandemic .  Please note the word "global".  You just have #TDS which is a less deadly virus whose symptoms include whining and bitching that Trump is still President.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AzemMay @TIME Yes.  On top of our failures to practice #CommonSense  hygiene and #SocialDistancing, the symptoms for the #coronavirus are so mild for 80% of us, that lot of people are going to be carrying this EASILY TRANSMITTED bug around and not even know it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GeekRemix @gotseacrets @France24_en I fear for all of that as well.  However, I've noticed that society is going to drift where society is going to drift.  And yes, people can suck.

<|startoftext|>@Eli_Sherman @wpri12 Thank you.  The press is supposed to be a check against the Government.  This, and the "directive" that's Rhode Islanders shouldn't (or cant?) gather in groups of 25 or more concerns me more than the #coronavirus<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NBC10_Lynzi @DanJaehnig @NBC10 @GovRaimondo IS the government and what powers they may abuse during this #CoronavirusOutbreak .

<|startoftext|>@NBC10_Lynzi @DanJaehnig @NBC10 @GovRaimondo You sarcasm meter is well tuned.

<|startoftext|>@NBC10_Lynzi @DanJaehnig @NBC10 This is news to me.  I honestly didn't think when @GovRaimondo ordered eat-in restaurants to be closed that it would affect their business.🙄 #Covid19impacts<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mrmartinbath I am not denying that "people need help".   But the reason is VERY RELEVANT if you wish to see that "1/4 of the people"stat go down.

<|startoftext|>@2ManySquirrels And by the time they get tested, and they get the results, and IF the results get reported back to whoever, they will probably be half way through the #COVID19  already (and that's if they tested positive for it).

<|startoftext|>@KimKalunian Yes.  80% of the cases are mild.  You might not even be aware you have the #COVID19  virus because the symptoms are so mild.

<|startoftext|>@LettuceCrisper @sarahlesnikoski I highly doubt that the MILLIONS OF PEOPLE that made the trek to the USA illegally were hindered by their country's social security system.😂.

<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods I remember hearing the news in the car about Reagan being shot.

<|startoftext|>@rgay @AOC In case you haven't noticed, #COVIDー19 virus doesn't really give a shit what type of healthcare system each country has.  But hey, why not use a global #Pandemic to push a political agenda, right?🤦‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sheefairee Well, as anyone not under a rock the last 2 months knows, there is a #COVIDー19 #pandemic going on.  Now, while this virus only causes mild flu-like symptoms in 80% of us, it's gonna hit 12% of the people hard and kill the other 8%.  We are going into lockdown to stem the spread.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@7thSon1988 @RealJamesWoods According to the #COVID19 stats, it looks like they do (so far).  Plus are a densely populated country of 120million on a few islands(10 times as dense as the USA).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods In Japan, they bow to one another.  I like that.  Plus it's hygienic.  I don't have Japan's stats for the #COVID19 virus at hand, but I remember noticing how low they were(at the time).  Coincidence?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahlesnikoski #commonsense 101.  If #Norway did have a better healthcare system, then people (especially the elderly) would be flocking from the USA to Norway in droves.  They aren't.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JeriLRyan #flatteningthecurve #socialdistancing #COVID19 The elderly are the most at risk to this.  Stay away and keep them isolated.

<|startoftext|>@AOC @ABC What a coincidence.  After a quick google search I found about 40% of Americans also own video game consoles.  I hope it's not any of the same people because I hear those video game consoles are quite expensive.  I also heard the individual games are pricey also.🤦‍♂️ #CommonSense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shortney0006 @CNN @MSNBC It would be rude of me to ask you to reason why you care.  This was not my intention (But I am glad you do care).  From what I've seen, elderly folks need to be isolated as best they can.  This #COVIDー19 is easily transmitted and its symptoms so mild, they can go unnoticed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shortney0006 @CNN @MSNBC I go by #CommonSense and what the data show me.  92% of the people who get #COVIDー19 have recovered.  8% have not.  Young people are safest.

<|startoftext|>@shortney0006 @CNN @MSNBC #SaferWithSanders says: "This disease will hurt us all".  #COVIDー19  says: " I have a 92% Recovery rate".  #CommonSense says "Listen to the #coronavirus FACTS and not those with a political agenda".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kirkacevedo Actually, all you NEEDED TO DO WAS FOLLOW BASIC HYGIENE PROTOCOLS that you should have learned when you were 5.  But, keep blaming the #COVID19 virus (a worldwide #Pandemic with a 92% recovery rate) on Trump if it makes you feel better.🤦‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DLoesch Thanks Dana.  Only thing I would add would be to please tell the idiots among us to stop #panicbuying .  They aren't helping matters.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ethan90820394 @GovRaimondo @RhodeIslandEMA I am no fan of @GovRaimondo but it is called a global #pandemic for a reason.

<|startoftext|>@startchangeri @TomIannitti @esanzi @CNN Yes, I remember #HIV and it was an eye opener.  But that virus didn't spread through the air like cold and flu viruses do.

<|startoftext|>@glamelegance @IvankaTrump If you are calling for Trump to resign and referring to the #COVIDー19  as the #TrumpVirus , what about resignations from of China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, France, Spain, Germany, Switzerland, The Netherlands and Sweden?🤔It's called a global #pandemic for a reason.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MusicMeetsOcean #socialdistance #useyourhead #CommonSense   The #COVIDー19 is easily transmittable and the vast (I say overwhelming) majority of people that get it experience ONLY MILD SYMPTOMS.

<|startoftext|>@RayGordonChess @antyabstract And I hope you are doing well.  China/S. Korea seeing a slowdown in new cases (as of yesterday), but we will see.

<|startoftext|>@MidSentryModern @antyabstract According to WorldoMeter, currently there is a 93% recovery rate for the #COVIDー19 virus.  And for active cases, 93% are in Mild Condition, 7% are Serious or Critical. The WHO estimated the mortality rate at 3.4% on March 3rd (12 days ago).  It is easily transmittable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeresuteHina @Romanoff2020 Total cases in Switzerland have increased 2.3x in the last 3 days.  Cases in Germany have increased 2.4x in the last 3 days.  Belgium 2.2x in the last 3 days. Greece 3.1x in the last seven days. They are not containing the #COVIDー19 virus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jspeedo7 No.  Stupid is that people actually waited until now to travel.  This #COVID19 has been in the news for a while, after all.🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Autarkh @GovPritzker @realDonaldTrump @VP What idiot would actually wait in that mess with other people that may already have the #COVIDー19  Lack of #CommonSense is flaming the flames of this virus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrDooleyMD Isn't the recovery rate like 93% for #COVIDー19 ?(according to WorldoMeter).  That's not "you might live", that's more like "you will PROBABLY live".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeresuteHina @Romanoff2020 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.  Check out the populations by age of all the European countries and the ones with high amounts of elderly.  If the trends continue, they are expected have the most deaths based on what we know so far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@keatonc33 @monterolaw @TeamPelosi Yea, good luck with that.  Here in America, when the government tells you to stay home and cancels all events because large crowds spread the virus, the knee-jerk reaction is to go out #panicshopping and gather in grocery stores with large crowds.  Fighting for toilet paper. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@keatonc33 @monterolaw @TeamPelosi You can't contain the #COVIDー19 virus if THE PEOPLE do not act responsibly.  Nothing else matters.  What part of that is tripping you up?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeresuteHina @Romanoff2020 Don't know what planet you live on, but Norway, and the rest of Europe is exploding with cases.  France and Spain are shutting down due to the #COVIDー19 virus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@keatonc33 @monterolaw @TeamPelosi Testing accomplishes ABSOLUTELY NOTHING if people ignore basic hygiene as well as documented #CommonSense flu prevention tips.  The #COVIDー19 will continue to spread no matter how many tests you do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DamoManC @Romanoff2020 Well, we have 50 state governments that are pretty clueless and and one Federal government with a bunch of people yelling at each other.  And half of them only care about making it Trump's fault with #TrumpPlague rantings and whatnot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DamoManC @Romanoff2020 That's good news.  And yes, the elderly and pre-existing folks are the main reason we have to stop this #COVIDー19 as over 95% of us will survive if we get it and 80% of us will only experience mild symptoms if we do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanielAshley13 @IvankaTrump Really.  Are you holding OTHER COUNTRIES' LEADERSHIPS to the same kind of scrutiny?  I don't know if you have read the news, but this #COVIDー19 is all over the world.  And those wonderful European countries (whose leaders "Care about the people") as worse off than us.  Please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@keatonc33 @monterolaw @TeamPelosi And the only countries I see a decline in are China and South Korea.  Which is good.  But I think France and Spain are going to completely shut down.  And the UK is exploding as well.  Given how easily it transmits and the mild symptoms this #COVIDー19 is hard to stop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@keatonc33 @monterolaw @TeamPelosi You can't contain the virus if people don't follow the #commonsense rules anyway.  And considering the symptoms ARE SO MILD for 80% of us, a great deal of people who wouldn't even think to get tested, have the virus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Romanoff2020 Cool.  Let's discuss it. How are those Utopian European counties with their magical healthcare systems handling the #COVIDー19 pandemic?  #CommonSense says (along with scientific data) not too good either.  They're in the same boat as us.  https://t.co/0H3EPxs8zx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@keatonc33 @monterolaw @TeamPelosi Curious.  Are you giving THE SAME SCRUTINY to the leaderships of other countries?  Because, IT SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE WORLD and they apparently didn't stop it either.  Even Europe, with it's perfect healthcare system couldn't stop it.  #CommonSense #COVIDー19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elle_schwyn @MelissaakaMom No, I think YOU are confused.  Russia had a disinformation campaign?  And do you think that sprung up overbite back 2016?  Or do you think EV-ER-Y MAJOR COUNTRY has a disinformation branch trying to influence others.  What the hell do you think the our CIA does?🤔  #CommonSense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Typhoon_Tyler Yoink!😃  https://t.co/zylV5JTMRM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mystical_Ocean @RDangler Curious.  Did the Atlantic run similar pieces for all the heads of states of any of the OTHER COUNTRIES where this #COVIDー19 is running rampant?  There are  A LOT OF THEM.  Moses couldn't stop this shit.  It's easily transmittable and to 80% of the people it's just a mild flu.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johniadarola @JeriLRyan Well obviously EVERYONE ELSE is doing it also because the virus is spreading.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RDangler And there isn't a god damned thing Trump, Obama, Biden, Bernie, Mini Mike, or even Hillary could have done to stop this flu bug from reaching us.  End of the day, they're all millionaires or billionaires with huge piles of money because "They give a flying fuck about us"  Please<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenWarren What is it with you and not repaying debt?    Do you not understand the concept?    It's called a LOAN and not a GIFT for a reason.🤔  #CommonSense  https://t.co/neOFaCjrUo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sushyness @SquidGertrude I think:  You pull up, open your mouth.  Some Rent-A-Nurse  sticks a Q-Tip down your throat.  Then they stick the Q-Tip into a bottle with your name on it and send it to a lab.  You'll get an email.  That's how I would imagine it will work.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tinaalicia2012 @DNC Banks and Wall Street are what made EV-ER-Y luxury you have today possible.  Without them, you'd be writing your little rant down on a piece of paper and mailing it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Knitter1958 @GHS @DrTedros @WHO @realDonaldTrump Europe is the EPICENTER.  Trump already banned incoming travel from there.  Looks like he was ahead of the curve again. Whining about #WhereAreTheCoronaVirusTest isn't helping matters.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods Bob is also picking up stocks REALLY CHEAP.  😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cusesoccer23 @MelissaakaMom Please.  Obviously a typo.  And the bigger threat than any foreign country, IMO.  The press was supposed to be a check against the government.  Now, they have morphed into the propaganda business, picking and pushing their own candidates.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBC10 Is that constitutional?  The right to peacefully assemble is in the 1st amendment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is pretty sick.  The @DNC has been acting this way since election night 2016.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neiltyson Neil, Long time listener, first time caller here.  Question:  If you are on the Moon and dig up an object, did you unearth it or unmoon it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cusesoccer23 @MelissaakaMom CNN gave Hillary the answers to debate questions ahead of the debate.  Are purposely acting ignorant?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cusesoccer23 @MelissaakaMom I don't give a hoot about our "dear leader".  If you are naive enough to think every country doesn't do it (along with media outlets, businesses, terror groups, etc), then stick to your safe space.  Keep trying to blame Russia for Hillary's loss if makes you feel better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cusesoccer23 @MelissaakaMom Elections are interefered with EV-ER-Y YEAR (my point from the start) by countries (and news outlets, et al). Only the most naive people would think otherwise.  You idiots acting like it only made a difference in 2016 and a reason (excuse) why Hillary lost is the humorous part.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cusesoccer23 @MelissaakaMom You read the Mueller witch hunt.  Show me any evidence a vote was changed because of it.  Answer= you can't.  A red herring.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cusesoccer23 @MelissaakaMom How about this.  Why don't you show me ONE SINGLE VOTE that was changed by this alleged interference first.  That way, we can establish you are not talking out of your ass.  Because, from what I've seen, this whole false Russia narrative talking point is just a red herring.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cusesoccer23 @MelissaakaMom The CIA has been interfering with other countries' elections since they were formed.  What the hell do you think they do all day, bake cookies? My point is that this shit has been going on since man first established borders.  It's only an issue when Hillary lost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovRaimondo @RIHEALTH Wash hands.  Don't touch nothing.  Keep the elderly and weak isolated.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AngelaRoquemore @TIME Mexico is a safe haven.  "Asylum seekers" should be plenty comfortable there while their concerns are addressed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@downwithogd @SsjVegetaM @TheBlackChannel "But father, we cannot get through the night unless we've had a good beating".  And so they went upstairs, and I could tell they were gonna get it before they even got up there.  "Will you stop touching me! Mine! Mine!".  Then, my wife talks to the ceiling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cusesoccer23 @MelissaakaMom Then you would ALSO have to credit Russia for helping Obama beat MCCain(08) and Romney(12).  Obviously, Russia would've preferred the inexperienced black man over the other established candidates. And I am sure they boosted Carter against Reagan(80).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MelissaakaMom @MsBeeCount @AnimalLoverVin So there is ZERO EVIDENCE bots or Russians had anything to do with influencing the election.  My theory is that the @DNC anointed the most hated woman on the planet because they thought "It's a woman's turn".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MsBeeCount @AnimalLoverVin @MelissaakaMom How did "Russian Putin bots" or "conspiracy theories" make Trump win in 16?  Did the bots or conspiracy theories change votes? #BidenLosesToTrump  #TDS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PRAYING4MUELLER And your little rant does what to explain why Trump won in 2016?  Perhaps you need a snack or maybe take in a movie and relax.  https://t.co/7hl62Ksvgm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ygrene Why bother.  I'd you are at an airport today, then you probably will catch the flu bug that's going around.  We'll let that take a shot at you first.  Always better to make a death appear natural.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnimalLoverVin @MelissaakaMom Cool, then if you've done the homework would you care to share with the rest of the class why Trump won in 2016?  I think it's because Trump won more electoral college votes, but I'm not smart☹️.  Be interested to hear what your extensive research uncovered.  #BidenLosesToTrump  https://t.co/OKLOcRXBEW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanisLupis75 Good point.  That's why isolation is key.  Not only the elderly but the people charged with their care should be isolated.  Anything going into where they are, should be given a Purell bath, IMO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnimalLoverVin @MelissaakaMom Sure, Trump may be a dope.  No argument here.  But if you hadn't smoked so much weed,  then maybe you could've explained why Trump won in 2016 instead of the same "we hate Trump" bullshit. Was it Russia or something else?🤔 #BidenLosesToTrump  https://t.co/3lJIgOC9A2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#flatteningthecurve Absolutely.  Keep old people and vulnerable people away from general population.  If enough people can recover from the #COVID19 flu, then we can get through this.  Wash your damn hands.  Cover your cough.  Keep your distance. Don't touch anything public.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As an independent, #ImMoreLikelyTo__Than__ Vote for Trump (again) than to vote for a "socialist" who owns three houses and has millions of dollars while backing a #GreenNewDeal that taxes OTHER PEOPLE at a 70% rate 🙄 #ByeBernie  https://t.co/w4ZE8znYiT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MelissaakaMom But but but I thought IT WAS THE RUSSIANS that made Trump win.  Not the absence of Bernie voters!?!?😮😮😮🤔😀😀😮 #BidenLosesToTrump  https://t.co/uSm83hfEct<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Kara_spirito @NBCNewsGraphics There isn't just one entity (the CDC) with the test kits.  So not everyone who got tested (or the results) may not even be available for some time.  Keep clean.  Limit exposure to others.  Be mindful of the elderly and weak.  They are the most vulnerable with any flu. #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@onedrink2many @Tom42716253 @AliAftabSial No worries.

<|startoftext|>@real_defender @realDonaldTrump Some will do anything that paints Trump in a negative light. Including using the #COVID2019 as a "Gotcha" game.  Time that could be better spent HELPING others with useful info like WASHING YOUR DAMN HANDS.  Be mindful around elderly folks.  They are really vulnerable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ravenx66 @real_defender @realDonaldTrump No, social media is responsible for spreading misinformation as well as reducing public confidence.  Twitter should be trending with helpful information about the #COVID2019 #coronavirus but instead is trending with  idiots and their #Trumpdemic #TrumpCrash conspiracy theories🙁.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mvpseamus @realDonaldTrump In that case, are you going to give Trump a percentage when your 401k goes up?  Otherwise, shut yo mouf please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InkyGhosts @HKrassenstein So, is that the turnover date?  July 1, 2019?  If so, please also indicate the turnover date for the Bush/Obama administrations.  I remember how Obama was blaming Bush years into his Presidency.  So, I am thinking around 2012 or 2013.  Thoughts? #marketcrash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InkyGhosts @HKrassenstein Then agree to a settlement date where Obama's influence ends and Trump's begins.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CSRA_prsn Yep.  Then you cannot simultaneously try to give credit to Obama for the good news of today, three years after he be gone. #marketcrash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HKrassenstein #marketcrash that is because the economy and Stock market are reacting to OBAMA's POLICIES still.  Remember?  If Obama still gets credit in good times then he must also still accept responsibility during the bad.  https://t.co/9YBMgcNyRm<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@David32252913 @THemingford And when you open your own factory, you can hire those workers to come work for you.  And remember, you have to pay them "a living wage" no matter how well the business is doing. Because every factory owner knows that money always keeps rolling in no matter what🙄.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@THemingford Yes, and the factory just magically appeared one day. The owner didn't have it built.  The owner didn't secure the money to have it built.  The owner didn't have the idea.  The owner didn't parse through all the red tape and obtain insurance. The owner doesn't pay for utilities🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KimberlyforIowa But if you want your business to succeed, then do what you feel is best and ignore people claiming to know what a living wage is, yet never say how much that is.🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RubyGirl28 @Miriam76885574 @DaysLeft4Trump @PressSec @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Yup.  No need to even axe people what party  dey supports.🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisJZullo Fun fact:. Congress controls spending.  Please also post the party that controlled Congress during each administration.  It's easy to cherry pick facts and state half-truths to suit a political agenda.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DividendReport @ZachandMattShow @politico Nobody gets $12,000.  NO BODY.  The $12,000 standard deduction is the amount you lower your taxable income by.  Notice the word "deduction".  That's it.  Nothing more.  Nothing less .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DividendReport @ZachandMattShow @politico Increasing taxes TAKES MORE MONEY FROM PEOPLE.  Lowering taxes TAKES LESS MONEY FROM PEOPLE.  What part of that is tripping you up?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DividendReport @ZachandMattShow @politico So.  Child protection STILL exists (along with the massive spending supporting it)  AND free money (courtesy of me) is being doled out on top of it?  How in the hell are we supposed to fund both?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DividendReport @ZachandMattShow @politico Naivety. People trap themselves in poverty.  The way out of poverty isn't to become dependent on a free check.  That will ONLY encourage people to keep that free money rolling in.  That's human nature.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DividendReport @ZachandMattShow @politico Big difference between helping people become better (with education, for example) and GIVING THEM A BLANK CHECK.  Suppose a "needy" mother gets her free check (meant to help out raising kids) and blows that cash at local casino. Kids are still hungry and the money is gone.  https://t.co/5NMpzcG9gq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DividendReport @ZachandMattShow @politico It is COMPLETELY different.  Tax cuts are the government TAKING LESS MONEY FROM YOU.  His plan is the government GIVING YOU MONEY (if he wins the election). Huge difference.  And how you don't see that as bribery, baffles me.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Purgatorio @AdeleCl80168764 @TPR2400 @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov I didn't say be careful or leave.

<|startoftext|>@Bullwong @GHS I meant to say the   Coronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases by Johns Hopkins CSSE  Website has that data.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bullwong @GHS The JHU site has a graph that shows total cases (inside and outside of China) over time.  It also shows the number of recovered which is steadily rising a lot faster than the total cases.  And that's good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelenKennedy @Babs15064131 @RobbieJee @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov Heres how I see it: Trump does not work for The Trump Corporation.  He does not run the day to day operations.  He does NOT currently draw a salary from the Trump Corporation.  I highly doubt there is any money going to him from Trump Corporation at this time.  He just owns it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bullwong @GHS That makes sense, but I'm not sure if that's it either.    Right now the John Hopkins site has  USA 153 confirmed cases 11 deaths 8 total recovered  What I would really like to see is an interview with one of the 8 people who have recovered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdeleCl80168764 @Purgatorio @TPR2400 @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov No.  I think things are headed in the right direction with this President.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Babs15064131 @HelenKennedy @RobbieJee @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov The Trump organization has expensive hotels.  I never stayed at any of them.  If that's where the President wants to stay, then that's his prerogative. Like it or lump it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Purgatorio @AdeleCl80168764 @TPR2400 @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov So.  The solution is more money?  And surely you can't be suggesting the parents of these children should bear any blame for all this.  They are victims as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelenKennedy @RobbieJee @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov The government doesn't pay Trump.  They pay the Trump organization.

<|startoftext|>@Purgatorio @AdeleCl80168764 @TPR2400 @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov Dumbing down America has been the cornerstone of the @DNC for the past 50 years.

Do you want to set limits on which home the President must stay in?   If so, would you be willing to impose those same restrictions on other elected officials?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PPact I hear that a lot.  Women want control of their bodies and I'm down with that.  However, what RESPONSIBILITIES do they have when a child magically comes out of their bodies?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MAGAJesusJTrump @DebbieJC5 @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov Sure is easy to decide how much is peanuts when talking about other people's money.🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Purgatorio @AdeleCl80168764 @TPR2400 @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov The latest collapse was due to banks FOLLOWING THE RULES and lending money to everyone because owning a home was "The American dream".  I remember Bill Clinton saying that in 1999 when the Financial Services act was passed.  Had people paid back the money, then no collapse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Purgatorio @AdeleCl80168764 @TPR2400 @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov The United States already has the second highest spending per student for education.  And the results are laughable, at best.  How is blindly throwing more money into education going to yield better results?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TPR2400 @AdeleCl80168764 @Purgatorio @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov No way.  It CANNOT be the parents' fault.  Parents are already overburdened with having to work.  They cannot be expected to take the time to educate their own children.  Teachers are PAID to educate them, and are failing miserably.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DebbieJC5 @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov $25 million is a lot of money.  That seems unrealistic to ask of someone who is already donating his entire Presidential salary to charities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Marmalady12 @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov That is for the courts to decide.  Not you.  And Trump lives for court.  Trump relinquished his role in The Trump organization after he was elected.  He and Ivanka resigned from their roles in the Trump organization.  I don't have to defend people following the law.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Marmalady12 @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov No one is being made into a servant.  We will have to pay for the extravagant lifestyle though.  The man has expensive taste.  Always has.  I'm not a defender but I am just shrugging.  As I said earlier, ask Congress to put a choke hold on that funding.  That's the only way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@corrigon_kc @Marmalady12 @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov The government has to pay to support our President along with his staff and security.  Like it or lump it.  Those are big numbers.  I would recommend you write your representative if you think it is too much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@corrigon_kc @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov It's not a business, asshole.  It's the government.  The elected position of President comes with a MANDATORY SALARY.  Trump couldn't decline it if he wanted to.  In fact, he tried.  If you think that salary is too high, write your representative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdeleCl80168764 @Purgatorio @TPR2400 @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov I would say that teaching is very important work.  Education is key to a successful society.  However, that philosophy has been perverted (thank you unions) into the hot mess we have today.  Teachers are failing our children.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@corrigon_kc @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov Oh no, it is not.  It is his salary.  In fact, the President HAS to take it.  Trump originally wanted to not get paid at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@corrigon_kc @Marmalady12 @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov When you travel, would you rather go to a place you own?  Yes, if you can.  If not, then stay at a property owned by someone else.  That's human nature.  Do you know what it means to be human?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdeleCl80168764 @keepemhonest2 @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov Sorry you feel that way.  I'll close by saying I think all of this is actually a good test of our country.  We are in uncharted waters (especially politically).  Be interesting to see how it turns out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Purgatorio @AdeleCl80168764 @TPR2400 @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov Actually, the Finance industry on the whole painfully efficient.  I started trading in the 90's.  Paid $19.95 commission on trades.  Then it was $14.95, then $9.95...$7.95...$4.95.  Today, they have COMMISSION FREE TRADES.  And FAST. wow!  That's not worsening.  That's better😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdeleCl80168764 @keepemhonest2 @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov Actually, he bends the ever-loving shit out of the rules.  I gotta admire doing that on a national (hell even global) scale.  He's the most watched man on the planet (as is any President).  Takes balls.  I've followed him for decades.  He lives for court so he will keep trying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Purgatorio @AdeleCl80168764 @TPR2400 @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov I know of no other profession where you can churn out a WORSENING PRODUCT EVERY SINGLE YEAR (poorly educated children) and have the audacity to DEMAND a raise!  All under the guise that they actually give a shit about anything except lining their pockets with more money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Marmalady12 @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov I never said he was the richest President.  I have never seen a ranking.  That being said, he has an extravagant lifestyle which we are going to have to pick up the tab for.  Like it or lump it.  Ask the Dems in Congress to put a choke hold on that money in the future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdeleCl80168764 @keepemhonest2 @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov Oh, I agree he CHOSE to work there.  However, it is below his lifestyle.  I remember he said it was a dump when he moved in.  Think of it this way: If we want the man to be our President (we did elect for him, after all), then we have to respect his needs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Daniel__Pool @yct @replouiegohmert What about the ones that weren't racist bastards.  Are you going to congratulate them as well?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexGrayson3 So what?  It's HIS money and he can spend it however he wants.  But know this:  Suppose, he was "on the right side of history" and his plan was going to transform the USA for the good.  Wouldn't that be considered money well spent if he won?  Something to think about.🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@djkocisi2 @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov No worries.  If you ever want to get slapped around again, you know where to find me.  Enjoy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@keepemhonest2 @AdeleCl80168764 @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov Right, I mean't to put "Some of these things are lifelong perks" but hit reply instead of the back arrow.  But ex Presidents do get a lot of perks and the best healthcare money can buy (his family too).  And I AGREE 100 PERCENT about it being too much especially for Congress.😃👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GHS I don't understand.  I am looking at a heat map of the Coronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases by Johns Hopkins CSSE (google it) and it says the USA has 122 cases.  Why such a discrepancy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@djkocisi2 @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov Run chicken, run.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@keepemhonest2 @AdeleCl80168764 @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov The taxpayers are paying for him to be President.  And if you don't like it now, you are going to hate it years down the road as these things are LIFELONG PERKS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@djkocisi2 @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov Then the government would pay the same businesses and entities they pay for any other President's security and staff.  These are requirements for the President to do his job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@keepemhonest2 @AdeleCl80168764 @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov Even if that were true, all the money doesn't go into Trump's pocket.  People have to run the business.  They have to get paid as well.  Then there is maintenance, insurance, utilities, taxes, etc etc etc.  Not to mention all the money Trump put into the place to start.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@THEblacksheepe @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov Hey give it a shot, dude.  More words of wisdom:  Don't get greedy.  Keep it simple.  Maybe one day you'll be in the news (one way or another).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@keepemhonest2 @AdeleCl80168764 @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov I'm sure there is some sort of arrangement between all parties involved.  Everyone seems happy enough.  Employees get fed and have a place to stay.  A happy employee is a productive one.  That's business 101.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@djkocisi2 @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov I don't know who the security details pays or why.  If they are on the job, I would think the government picks up the tab for most things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@THEblacksheepe @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov No.  But doing all those things requires one to get off of one and GO DO IT.  You just don't snap your fingers and become President one day.  Or start a charity.  Although you could technically start and run a charity from your couch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdeleCl80168764 @keepemhonest2 @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov He is ALWAYS THE PRESIDENT.  He has to be 24/7/365.  No matter where he goes.  And he HAS to have security and support staff no matter where that is.  Are you going to CONFINE him to home?(a home of your choosing, no less)  He is a free man, after all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdeleCl80168764 @TPR2400 @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov The hell it isn't.  Ripping off the American taxpayers is RULE NUMBER ONE for all elected officials, government employees, public sector unions (teachers are the worst), and contractors(esp defense).  Where the hell you been living the last 100 years?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@djkocisi2 @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov You are paying for the security and office of the President.  Same as any other President.  This one just happens to have a more lavish lifestyle.  You know, like the ones of all those other celebrities.  Fancy things and whatnot.  Lots of lavish homes (near golf courses).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TPR2400 @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov Not so fast there, pal.  First, you have to GET TO THE PRESIDENCY for that perk to kick in.  And that 6 figure salary better start with a 4 if you want to match "The Donald".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@THEblacksheepe @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov Well, that's a chore as well.  First, you have to get off the couch.  Go outside and meet people.  Convince them to donate their hard earned money to your worthy cause.  You got to set up all the crap and make it look like you actually give a shit.  A lot of work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@keepemhonest2 @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov It's where he lives.  This President is entitled to security just as much as any others.  Like it or lump it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelenKennedy @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov You are paying for Presidential security.  The current one has a lot of haters out there (see all of Twitter).  And he just happens to live near a lot of golf courses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@THEblacksheepe @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov If it were only that simple.  You'd have to get off the couch first.  Then go out and meet people and come up with some bullshit so they will vote for you.  Then it takes a shitload of money and there is no chance you will win (ask Hillary😆).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Marmalady12 @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov These "Properties" is where Trump lives.  He is ENTITLED (love that word) to the same standard of living he had before becoming President.  He just happened to be so rich that the White House is actually a STEP DOWN for him.😆  https://t.co/6VvXL8O0eY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xpluso415 @Nitemists @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov And the President HAS BEEN DONATING HIS ENTIRE SALARY since he took office.  He wanted to DECLINE his salary, but must take it, by law.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteelPreservat1 @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov Ooooh.  That killed me, Mr tough guy.  https://t.co/btJ06UIFE0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xpluso415 @father_kipz @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov That's right.  He was crying about Obama playing golf all the time and kept saying he wasn't born in America.  Forced Obama to show his birth certificate.  And yes, look at him now.  45th President of the United States.  Still can't believe it.  LOL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nitemists @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov No, I will not leave.  Even though I keep hearing on Twitter that there are other countries better than America.  I am staying.  And when you start donating your entire salary to charities, come talk smack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@THEblacksheepe @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov Save your money.  Move to the ghetto.  You ain't gotta spend shit and there is all kinds of free stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xpluso415 @father_kipz @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov Then put a cap on how much can be spent for security.  It's within the power of Congress.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erikbee5 @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov Democrats control the House.  The House must approve budgets.  Call your Congressional representative if you are upset.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Marmalady12 @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov Nobody is paying Trump $100 million to play golf.  You are paying for security which is what you would be paying for no matter what.  You just don't like Trump.  Which is fine by me.  Free country and whatnot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DebbieJC5 @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov Curious.  How much would our President have to donate in order to meet your lofty standards?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@father_kipz @JeffreyKrasner @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @HHSGov Please.  That money is for security for the President.  Either change the laws or when another (D) occupies the Oval office and gets PAID, keep up the hyperbole when he (or she) cashes in.

<|startoftext|>@sandyhfishy @FatAcrobat @mamamorinny @shannonrwatts "Suicide by gun is far more lethal than other means"?  Yes, that's kinda the point of a suicide, isn't it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mamamorinny @sandyhfishy @shannonrwatts I'm not disputing any statistics.  I am just relating what I have seen in my day-to-day life.  Zero people shot.  Zero guns fired anywhere near me (except at the range).  However, I have seen death by car as well as numerous accidents. Plus all kinds of CRAZY drivers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bshellington11 @shannonrwatts I have never witnessed anyone being shot with ANY weapon.  I have witnessed one person die in a wreck (idiot was doing over a 100) and tried to remove him from his car but was he pinned and already dead. Seen cars crash MANY times with injuries first-hand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sandyhfishy @shannonrwatts No, it isn't too much to ask.  However, we have TONS of traffic laws on the books and they are blatantly disregarded by the public.  Accidents and deaths ensue.  I see THIS first-hand (not on the news or YouTube). Yet, I see no gun violence first-hand. But see it in the media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@annabel39764124 @shannonrwatts I can only tell you what I see.  I've taken the pulse of a dead man pinned inside a car but never had to render aid to a gunshot victim.

<|startoftext|>@shannonrwatts I feel more threatened by traffic fatalities than gun fatalities.  I have NEVER seen a weapon fired (outside a shooting range or hunting trip).

<|startoftext|>@koziz5 @ChrisHe27578931 @DrJoanWeller1 @PoisonedMalibu @mortk88 @TomPerez @TheDemocrats Right.  And in those 15 (I say more) years, we should have seen evidence of people leaving to go to this supposed Utopian country in droves. But it's not happening because.......🤔 #CommonSense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@koziz5 @ChrisHe27578931 @DrJoanWeller1 @PoisonedMalibu @mortk88 @TomPerez @TheDemocrats Probably because this country favors individualism.  People do what is best for themselves.  No need for a tyrannical demsoc state to tell us what is best for us or tell us "what our best interests are".  That's the culture.  And it won't work here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@koziz5 @ChrisHe27578931 @DrJoanWeller1 @PoisonedMalibu @mortk88 @TomPerez @TheDemocrats You cannot change the country's culture with a snap of the finger or new tax laws.  You'd have an easier time outlawing homosexuality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@koziz5 @ChrisHe27578931 @DrJoanWeller1 @PoisonedMalibu @mortk88 @TomPerez @TheDemocrats Negative.  #CommonSense dictates that if these Utopian countries actually did exist, people would be leaving the USA in droves.  They aren't because what you are selling isn't real.  It's nothing more than a political agenda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@koziz5 @ChrisHe27578931 @DrJoanWeller1 @PoisonedMalibu @mortk88 @TomPerez @TheDemocrats Right, there is no mass exodus because those Utopian countries either don't exist or they are being greatly exaggerated.  Otherwise, you would see Americans booking one way trips to these countries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@koziz5 @ChrisHe27578931 @DrJoanWeller1 @PoisonedMalibu @mortk88 @TomPerez @TheDemocrats You aren't going to change this country to match these supposed Utopian countries you claim are out there until there is a massive culture change in this country.

<|startoftext|>@koziz5 @ChrisHe27578931 @DrJoanWeller1 @PoisonedMalibu @mortk88 @TomPerez @TheDemocrats I have been on Twitter for years.  Having seen one hash tag trending from people that moved from the US to one of these Utopian countries.  Nothing on the news about a mass exodus from here to there.  Either it's the most loosely guarded secret or it simply isn't true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@koziz5 @ChrisHe27578931 @DrJoanWeller1 @PoisonedMalibu @mortk88 @TomPerez @TheDemocrats Not horrible at all.  If you truly believe there is a country better than the USA, it behooves you to move there first and foremost.  But don't assume their cultures will magically develop in this country if we change the rules here.  It ain't gonna happen, kid.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@koziz5 @ChrisHe27578931 @DrJoanWeller1 @PoisonedMalibu @mortk88 @TomPerez @TheDemocrats #CommonSense  So, to summarize your ENTIRE argument: It's NOT so much better in other countries as it is here in the USA🇺🇸.  You just like to pretend it is in a feeble effort to bolster your political agenda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@koziz5 @ChrisHe27578931 @DrJoanWeller1 @PoisonedMalibu @mortk88 @TomPerez @TheDemocrats #CommonSense  If this Utopia were real, then Twitter would be exploding with tweets saying "I moved from America to [country] AND ITS AWESOME 😀.

<|startoftext|>@koziz5 @ChrisHe27578931 @DrJoanWeller1 @PoisonedMalibu @mortk88 @TomPerez @TheDemocrats Not saying it's any ism.  There is a cultural difference.  Your demsoc nonsense won't work without a cultural change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@koziz5 @ChrisHe27578931 @DrJoanWeller1 @PoisonedMalibu @mortk88 @TomPerez @TheDemocrats Then you better be ready to change the culture of this country.  I got one word for you, Janteloven.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@koziz5 @ChrisHe27578931 @DrJoanWeller1 @PoisonedMalibu @mortk88 @TomPerez @TheDemocrats And that common sense doesn't apply to the millions who come to this country illegally?  You wouldn't ask the same of them?  Fight for making things better in their societies?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@koziz5 @ChrisHe27578931 @DrJoanWeller1 @PoisonedMalibu @mortk88 @TomPerez @TheDemocrats Why should I?  You are the one stating how "great" it is in other countries.  Common sense dictates if that were true, you would move to one of them and never look back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@koziz5 @ChrisHe27578931 @DrJoanWeller1 @PoisonedMalibu @mortk88 @TomPerez @TheDemocrats Again, news agencies aren't reporting nightly about America's AWESOME infrastructure.

<|startoftext|>@AnitaBaffoni @wpri12 @SpeakerPelosi And we wonder why the Federal Government is over $20,000,000,000,000 in debt. Maybe because they use 10 pens to sign one name on a piece of paper. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NathanAgle65 @TomiLahren @BernieSanders @MorganZegers Ask those same countries about their CULTURE as well.  Ask them about their tax rates, which they are happy to pay.

<|startoftext|>@SenWarren @EsperDoD @Raytheon @DeptofDefense Tread lightly cutting defense spending.  Yes, there is waste.  Yes, there is corruption.  But, it is THE MOST VITAL part of our country.  The world literally depends on it.  https://t.co/V4odzxOWXq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@insegnos @kevinbealer @Landry2Randall @TomiLahren Can't argue that.  I've been following Trump since the 80's.  Self centered prick then.  Self centered prick now.

<|startoftext|>@michaelberg26 @TeeHodges @SwampdrainerRay Reports can say anything they want.  Act accordingly based what's written in them if you want.  That's what the Democrats have done.  They can always bring up more impeachment articles and vote on those as well.  Then the Senate can do their thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevinbealer @Landry2Randall @TomiLahren That's right.  Trump is rich as shit and he's always going to be rich as shit.  He has always been about enriching himself (or at least trying to).  We knew this when electing him.  However, Obama was supposed to be different.  Apparently, he is JUST LIKE TRUMP.  https://t.co/qpKMJsvSXM<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@taradublinrocks Yes.  I remember the laughter after he got off that escalator and announced his candidacy.  I remember how he'd never get the RNC nod.  I remember how giddy Democrats were when he did because Hillary was going to win in a landslide because it was a woman's turn to be President.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@harmlou @jlstebe @neal_katyal Plenty of enjoyment out there.  Unfortunately, you have been brainwashed (the power of advertising) into equating enjoyment with spending money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IraSpectre @realDonaldTrump No, it's benefits WHOEVER invests.  You clowns CHOOSE to send your money to streaming services, cable companies, liquor and dope stores as well any company that advertises the next "gotta have" thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jlstebe @neal_katyal Funny how the middle and lower classes always seem to have money for cable, Netflix, NBA tickets, Movie tickets and trips to Disneyland.  But never enough to invest.🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IraSpectre @realDonaldTrump Actually, it benefits ANYONE who invested.  Everyone is free to invest (or not).  You can keep spending money on Netflix or invest in yourself.  Your choice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Moxiemom70 @MelaShea I agree.  And I'm a man.  In my opinion,  women definitely got the short end of the stick when it comes to maintenance.  Still doesn't excuse all the complaining, but at least I sympathize.😀 #IfGodWereFemale<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RemoveTrump33 A better question would be "Do I care who held the position before Sean Connelly?".  The answer to that is no.  My point was (is) that the Pres. gets the best of the best.  He has an urgent Care clinic in his house.  A staff even follows him around when travelling.  All free.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RemoveTrump33 No, the President's physician.  Sean Connelly.  He is in charge of the unit that takes care of the President.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RemoveTrump33 You don't understand.  There is healthcare and there is healthcare.  Unless the average 65 year old has a doctor's office literally in their house and a team dedicated to them (like Trump does), then they have the former.  Presidents and ex Presidents get the latter.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Drea_got_time Yes.  Democrat policies have been so amazing for blacks.  Their race has been THRIVING under them for decades.  Let's continue to vote Democrat for more of the same!😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maciekbaron @AOC No, the tax policies for any country at any given time are due to THE CULTURE OF THAT COUNTRY AT THE TIME.  During that time (50's early 60's), tax policies were a reflection of that culture.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maciekbaron @AOC My word, you are dense.  Do you think Sweden (or any country) just picked their tax policies out of thin air?  Current tax rates for any country are the results of their respective cultures.  Cherry picking one part of their tax code and dropping it in another country won't work.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@glennbeck I can remember Iran being a pain in the ass back in the 70's.  I remember the 444 days of hostages and the Mickey Mouse T-shirts.  They just do not play nice.  Didn't then.  Don't today.  I don't want a war but won't piss and moan if one starts.  I will support our country.🇺🇸😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maciekbaron @AOC And good for Sweden.  That 69% tax rate comes along with A DIFFERENT CULTURE than that which is here in the United States.  Adopt Sweden's culture here and maybe you have a shot.  Otherwise, 👎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maciekbaron @AOC That was the culture of the USA at the time of those tax rates.  Segregation didn't end in the USA until 1964.  Also during that time, homosexuals were routinely assaulted (gay bashing) and the government did little to stop it (hate crimes weren't really defined). Good times? Not<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CVSHealth Depends if it costs anything or it's free.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eddiemikus @aarond @AOC Simple Google search shows 70 NBA , 35 MLB and a dozen or so NFL players that would INSTANTLY pay over 50% in taxes.  The tipping point(the govt gets more than you) with the Bimbo's plan is $16,675,000/year based on my math by laying the 70% rate at the top of the tax brackets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maciekbaron @AOC Correct.  The USA did have a 90% tax rate.  Although very few people paid it.  And you could also deduct things like credit card interest.  It also was from a time  when women stayed in the home, gays were safely tucked in the closet.  And blacks could be refused service.  Lovely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeeHodges @michaelberg26 @SwampdrainerRay Whether I support the clown or not, my opinion means zip.  It's up to CONGRESS to act.  They acted.  Investigations ensued.  Work with what the investigation came up with.  Not liking someone isn't grounds for impeachment.  No matter how butt hurt you are.  That's emotional.😫<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaelberg26 @TeeHodges @SwampdrainerRay Actually, I don't.  If Congress has found something in the investigations to act on, then they should.  After all, it's their job.  They obviously haven't found ANYTHING.  Although, like I said earlier, you apparently know something nobody else does.  Or, you suffer from TDS.🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aarond @AOC Oh, by all means.  Explain the Progressive tax system to me. I will sleep through the first part, but wake me when you get to the tipping point (where the government actually makes more than you do for your hard work).  Then we can list all the Non-billionares it harms, together.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeeHodges @michaelberg26 @SwampdrainerRay Lol.  I'm not a Trump defender, he obviously can do that himself (check Twitter rants).  I've been following him since the 80's.  Jerk then, jerk now(in my opinion).  As President, he been investigated for years and they came up with dick.  But you know something they don't?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeeHodges @michaelberg26 @SwampdrainerRay Again.  Can you show me how Russia meddling caused Trump to win or changed a single vote.  Still waiting...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aarond @AOC Nothing false about it.  70% rate.  And what is really embarrassing is the people actually believe it will magically stop the Earth from something it's been doing for Billions of years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenWarren @BradSherman Um, you could just simplify taxes.🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC With a proposed SEVENTY PERCENT TAX RATE, I would recommend the insanity party.🙄😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaelberg26 @TeeHodges @SwampdrainerRay Don't you think China wanted Hillary to win? Given Trump's rhetoric about imposing tariffs on them(which he followed through on). Do you think Russia wanted Obama to win over McCain?  Do you think Russia wanted Carter to win over Reagan? Shits been going  on for decades!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeeHodges @michaelberg26 @SwampdrainerRay Opinions vary.  Still waiting on ANYONE who can explain how the "aid of foreigner meddlers" swung THIS election and why this is the first time in American history it happened.  *Crickets*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeeHodges @michaelberg26 @SwampdrainerRay The majority of STATES chose him.  That's the only thing that matters in a presidential election.  Obviously, you were absent that day in school.   Please explain how meddling in 2016 by "foreigners" changed a single vote in that election.  And why it's the first time it matters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaelberg26 @SwampdrainerRay Ummm, he parlayed that into becoming the President of the United States.  I'm not the sharpest knife in the cookie jar, but that looks pretty successful to me. 🙄  https://t.co/p4iDC96NUn<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MazzaDammit @Jenna49199126 @undrcvrmexican @RAICESTEXAS You don't know that.  What are they fleeing?

<|startoftext|>@Acharenus @Jenna49199126 @undrcvrmexican @RAICESTEXAS No.  ICE and Homeland security do not engage in Human Trafficking.  Human trafficking is used to the purpose of sexual exploitation and or force labor.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_Caleb_R @Jenna49199126 @undrcvrmexican @RAICESTEXAS So, you are saying that a corrupt government cannot be changed or reclaimed by the people?  Excuse me, but isn't that what Democrats in this country are trying to do as we speak?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_Caleb_R @Jenna49199126 @undrcvrmexican @RAICESTEXAS Plenty of houses before you got to mine.  Why did you choose mine?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rabidya And if that's my choice?  It's okay to ridicule it?  What if my sexuality includes never fucking anything, yet I like to be fucked.  You got a problem with that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheCumPoster @Jenna49199126 @undrcvrmexican @RAICESTEXAS No faith.  No trolling.  Apparently it's okay to ridicule someone's sexual behaviors as long as you feel it's okay.

<|startoftext|>@_Caleb_R @Jenna49199126 @undrcvrmexican @RAICESTEXAS No, you came into my house to give birth to a child under the assumption the child (and you) will get free shit.  Nothing more.

<|startoftext|>@TheCumPoster @Jenna49199126 @undrcvrmexican @RAICESTEXAS You literally said "Like a man that's never fucked".  How is that not a comment about either my body (maybe I don't have a penis) or sexuality (I like trees)?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheCumPoster @Jenna49199126 @undrcvrmexican @RAICESTEXAS Cool.  Personal attacks.  But be careful about personal attacks about my sexuality.  I could be gay and label you a homophobic Trump supporter.😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jenna49199126 @undrcvrmexican @RAICESTEXAS No, but I do have a lease with an option to buy.  So that's something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jenna49199126 @undrcvrmexican @RAICESTEXAS Again.  I am asking you if someone waltzed into YOUR HOUSE while you were away and whether you would let them dictate what they want to do.  It's a simple question.  I know your angry Trump won and won't be removed from office anytime soon.  Put those emotions aside please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jenna49199126 @undrcvrmexican @RAICESTEXAS That's nice.  I really don't care what you WOULDNT DO.  I am asking if you would let ME dictate the terms of where me and my child can go after I came into your house and dropped a baby.  It's a simple yes or no question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CompleteRuckus @MidwestByName And Clinton spending weeks denying the affair and he held a Prime Time TV (internet still in it's infancy at the time) address telling  the nation denying the affair (infamous speech) until he found out that crazy Monica kept a dress with his baby batter on it.  Whoopsie.😫<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CompleteRuckus @MidwestByName Yes.  There was a lawsuit filed by another woman (Paula Jones) against Clinton for sexual harassment.  That lead to Monica (who originally lied about the affair) which lead to Linda Tripp who recorded Monica admitting there was an affair.  Which lead to Clinton lying under oath.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CompleteRuckus @MidwestByName Clinton got popped for Perjury and Obstruction of Justice by Republicans in the House.  Democrats in the Senate acquitted him.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AOC If you want a PROVEN renewable energy source, go nuclear.  And keep an eye on India as I read recently they are going to try Thorium based Reactors and see if they can make that work.  If so, we maybe we are able to emulate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC Energy has to be cheap and reliable.  Fossil fuels accomplish this.  When renewables can do the same, they will.  And not one second prior.  Bank on that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BruceRayCarr1 @2beaux @AOC @TedDanson @TheLeap_Org A business, EVERY BUSINESS, must make a profit over time.  They don't have a choice.  Make a profit (or break even at the least) or go belly up.  That's business 101.   I think you need to come off some off that money and start spending some to support businesses.😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BruceRayCarr1 @2beaux @AOC @TedDanson @TheLeap_Org Why would you hire workers if there is no work for them.  That's like hiring a pool cleaner after you filled in the pool with dirt and don't use it anymore.🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BruceRayCarr1 @2beaux @AOC @TedDanson @TheLeap_Org With increased productivity comes a reduction of the amount of workers needed.  If a company doesn't need workers, then wages will be stagnant.  When many companies are looking for workers and there are fewer available, then wages will rise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BruceRayCarr1 @AOC @TedDanson @TheLeap_Org But one thing to consider is the breakup of MA Bell in 1984.  Basically opening up communication industry as we know it today.  Without that, I highly doubt we would have these gizmos that I am typing on today without a phone cord attached to a wall.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BruceRayCarr1 @AOC @TedDanson @TheLeap_Org Stock buybacks should, in theory, increase shareholder value.  Less shares on the market.  It also allows the company to "Invest in itself" when they feel the market has discounted it's share price enough. Just like we do.  Seems fair.  I agree regulations are needed though.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BruceRayCarr1 @AOC @TedDanson @TheLeap_Org You can't pick one statistic from an era and place it in another and expect the same results.  That 90% tax rate was only paid by a handful of (8, if memory serves) people.  Plus just about everything was deductable (credit card interest, for one).  Try that today and 👎☹️.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BruceRayCarr1 @AOC @TedDanson @TheLeap_Org Well, in the 1950's just about every single aspect of the USA was controlled by white men.  A Woman's place was in the house.  Gays were safely tucked away in the closet.  And if you had black friends, good luck eating together at a restaurant down south.  Different era than now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrainGoodCarBad @yqxSTpLUrarpcME @AOC Cool.  Can we get rid of all the social programs as well as the departments of energy and education as well?  And we also go back to not having 12 million illegal immigrants that pay little or absolutely zero taxes?  Thanks in advance.,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrainGoodCarBad @yqxSTpLUrarpcME @AOC No, but the productivity rate (along with life expectancies) was pretty low.  You think these gizmos and gadgets today could be made by a mom and pop store down on the corner?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@yqxSTpLUrarpcME @TrainGoodCarBad @AOC How about we make the first 5k of interest, dividends and capital gains TAX FREE for the folks making less than $250k a year?  After that, it's a flat 10 or 15% of everything over 5k.  People making over $250k per year pay the flat 10 or 15% from dollar one.  Is that a fair deal?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrainGoodCarBad @yqxSTpLUrarpcME @AOC Labor wouldn't be any to "produce" it in the first place if the company wasn't there to begin with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrainGoodCarBad @yqxSTpLUrarpcME @AOC The money in a family has ALREADY BEEN TAXED at least once.  Multiple times if it's income from interest, dividends or some kind of capital gains.  Can you fault a family for saving THEIR OWN money and using it however they desire?  That's messed up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrainGoodCarBad @yqxSTpLUrarpcME @AOC Who is giving them a handout?  If you think that a family working together is somehow akin to someone getting a handout, then I truly weep that people like you are even allowed into school let alone teach in one.  No wonder kids today are so fucked up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrainGoodCarBad @yqxSTpLUrarpcME @AOC You work in education?  Well thanks for doing such a piss-poor job of educating our children.  Epic fail.  And you are correct, a lot of successful people get help from family members BECAUSE THATS WHAT FAMILIES ARE SUPPOSED TO DO.🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TIME We have to add "Defeating Hillary Clinton in an election".  As a high crime and misdemeanor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yqxSTpLUrarpcME @TrainGoodCarBad @AOC Well, CEOs usually have enough perspicacity (Google it if you went to a public school) to see past their next 15 minute break.  They usually don't sit around and wait for someone to give them money just for showing up to work.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rahmani_khatera @TIME You can get an abortion every week as far as I am concerned.  But it ISNT a medical decision, it is a result of you actively going out and doing something to become pregnant.  Your victim card is declined.  https://t.co/eqjurLTbsv<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@alxcharlesdukes @TuurinTurambar @KamSage @LuxNeonUniverse @NBCNews I disagree.  Governments cannot improve productivity, that what the evil private sector does best.

<|startoftext|>@alxcharlesdukes @TuurinTurambar @KamSage @LuxNeonUniverse @NBCNews And if things become cheaper when they are easier to do (which I agree with), then why do medical costs keep rising so much?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alxcharlesdukes @TuurinTurambar @KamSage @LuxNeonUniverse @NBCNews Can productivity grow faster than the amount of people that are becoming dependant on these programs?

<|startoftext|>@Gatmaan @MaliWarrior @TuurinTurambar @DeepThoughtsUSA @yqxSTpLUrarpcME @KamSage @LuxNeonUniverse @NBCNews Well, let's do the math...The office of the President is paid $400,000 per year.  Times 8 years equals $3,200,000 if Obama saved every dime and paid no taxes.  He obviously got a large chunk of money from somewhere else.  Did he work at Starbucks after he left office?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TuurinTurambar @MaliWarrior @Gatmaan @DeepThoughtsUSA @yqxSTpLUrarpcME @KamSage @LuxNeonUniverse @NBCNews Seems to me, Trump did the same thing.  So, would it be possible that Trump and Obama are the same?  Both cashed in, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TuurinTurambar @MaliWarrior @Gatmaan @DeepThoughtsUSA @yqxSTpLUrarpcME @KamSage @LuxNeonUniverse @NBCNews Hmm, so if becoming famous at the expense of the government allows you to "earn" Tens of millions of dollars, that means you worked for it?

<|startoftext|>@jacksquirrels @RyanEGraney @IvankaTrump @USATODAY Agreed.  Workers in sweatshops all around the globe are suffering.

<|startoftext|>@teslagre4 If you think this is the first time one country wanted to influence another country via its elections, then you are as dumb as you look.

<|startoftext|>@mkotsmith @NickValance @forever420grrl @RickKyker @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama I actually liked Obama.  Disagreed with 90% of what he said, but I liked the cut of his jib.   I also think economic statistics are incorrectly tied to a specific Presidential term.  Economies expand and contract naturally, regardless of the clown in the White House at the time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickValance @forever420grrl @RickKyker @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Well, he did it.  He "inherited" a bad economy if I recall correctly.

<|startoftext|>@AuthorNNBrown @MorganMrs None of these happened election night 2008.  But thanks for playing.  My point being that the impeachment process was set in motion from election night.  The hatred of Trump by the "party of unity" has brought us to this point.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AuthorNNBrown @OyveyJJ @MorganMrs Actually, Bill Clinton committed perjury.  Perjury is where you lie under oath (I am assuming you went to a public school) as well as obstruction of Justice. That's what he was impeached (by the House) for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AuthorNNBrown @MorganMrs Don't remember seeing people crying in the streets on election night in 2008 chanting "Fuck Obama" or "Not my President" while destroying property.  Also don't recall any impeachment hearings held by anyone during his term.  Just saying.🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Chubbysquirrel8 Again, flattered that you went through 16 months of my posts🥰.   My point was spending habits are a driving force of long term wealth accumulation.

<|startoftext|>@biaster69_420 @JanGilson "socially acceptable" depends on the society and the times.  Hatred and violence gotta start somewhere.

<|startoftext|>@CheryMy @HollaBlackGirl Because the world only cares about what you look like and how you act.  And by "look like", I don't mean the color of your skin (duh).

<|startoftext|>@CheryMy @HollaBlackGirl Well, if you "know" there is a racial stigma with you, then you will act accordingly.

<|startoftext|>@justbitsy @InnaMidwest @fleur_de_lis_ @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Yes, 2016 was the first time in history one government tried to influence another country's election.

<|startoftext|>@Tralfamad0re @JulianCastro @AOC Only if they are doing it against their will.  And thank your wonderful UNIONS for they are the ones most opposed to having criminals work as firefighters.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@myworldmysun @SSWorks @AOC Won't work.  Going to cost way too much money for the working middle class. Someone, somewhere has to pay.  And it's always the money earners via taxes.  Plus,  you lower healthcare for everyone just to appease the bottom rung of the ladder.  Obamacare has showed us that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@myworldmysun @SSWorks @AOC There's a ton of oil out there.  Nonetheless, I am ALL FOR an alternative as long as it is cheap and reliable (and easy would be a plus).

<|startoftext|>@myworldmysun @SSWorks @AOC Oil is not a quick fix.  It's a reliable and relatively cheap form of energy.  And it's not just the rich that can profit.

<|startoftext|>@thememoryhole2 Too funny.  An entire county got "Hacked" and that is why Hillary lost.  That's my agenda and I'm sticking to it.😅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fabprochnow I am just hoping scientists and doctors can crack the mystery of what causes pregnancies in women.  They have got to be close.🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChaoticReaper88 Never said to criminalize abortion.  If you want to fuck everything under the sun, so be it.  More power to you. But common fucking sense tells us that it can and will cause a pregnancy.  The victim card is not applicable when the situation is completely your doing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChaoticReaper88 It isn't anonymity.  The female body does not magically become pregnant at a certain age.  Something has to happen to cause the pregnancy. Scientists are working on that.  Once we crack that, then I would assume women could make intelligent and informed decisions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChaoticReaper88 A). Hyperbole.  No state is banning abortion.  B). Please explain what rights men have that women don't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KirstenPowers I say wait for science.  Scientists have got to be close finding out what causes pregnancies in women.  Once we know what causes pregnancies, then surely women would be able to make informed decisions on the matter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trantsylvania @AOC Seems to me, a simple and sensible plan would have bullets that people who support the plan would showcase instead of calling them names.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChaoticReaper88 I have no intentions of making abortions Illegal.  In my opinion, abortions should be legal, safe and rare (Bill Clinton).  And if males are equally responsible for pregnancies, then shouldn't they have a say in an abortion?  No?  Fine with me. Just stop crying about it please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drjoshmichaels It isn't that we don't spend enough on "education".  We keep spending more and more every year.  The problem isn't money, the problem is the public education system. In my humble opinion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trantsylvania @AOC Personal attacks aside, I am curious the rationale that goes into simply raising a tax rate to 70% under the guise that it will accomplish anything other than more dependency on government programs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonTheCaptive @skiskamp Why would you spend your own money when there's a gubment program that will pay for it?  Now THAT'S smart business.😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trantsylvania @AOC You can guess what I have till you are blue in the face and you still wouldn't get it right.  What I am questioning is that how anyone could think a 70% tax rate could solve anything other than creating more dependency on more government programs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonTheCaptive @skiskamp I don't remember saying it was GOOD business.  I've been following Trump since the 80's.  I didn't like him then, and I still don't now.  I don't see how you can call him lazy though.  A lazy person wouldn't have run for and achieved the Presidency.  That's common sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChaoticReaper88 No, sweetie, I am NOT saying rape victims made that choice.  What I am saying is that if women are responsible enough to make their own CHOICE with their own bodies then they should also be willing to STEP UP and deal with those CHOICES when they CHOOSE to have a child.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SmallFryInNY @AOC So, tell me what RESPONSIBILITIES are the poor and distressed and underprivileged people going to accept in exchange for the 70% tax rate?  Also, if we continue to import more poverty via Illegal immigrants, is that 70% tax rate gonna increase? #LiberalLogic101<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonTheCaptive @skiskamp And?  He wasn't an elected official at the time.  That's  called BUSINESS.  Google General Motors, Chrysler, Pan Am, etc and maybe you learn something.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@macauley_monica @LouDobbs For those of us not born rich, we accumulate wealth by spending less than we make for an extended period of time.  Yes, raising a child is expensive.

<|startoftext|>@macauley_monica @LouDobbs Correction.  What happens when they still HAVEN'T accumulated any more wealth?  Keep in mind, corporations and regulations allow people to take out lans against their own 401k plans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@macauley_monica @LouDobbs Okay.  Say they get the extra pay (for doing nothing extra) and have the ability to save BUT spend all their extra money on toys, gizmos and all the absolute crap advertises and have accumulated any wealth?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@macauley_monica @LouDobbs Soooo, we either shower the bottom with cash(no strings attached) or spend a ton of $$ for programs to subsidize everything?  And after all that, if the wealth gap hasn't shrunk due to no effort on their behalf, what do we do then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@macauley_monica @LouDobbs Cool. Maybe you can answer a question NOBODY wants to answer.  In order to shrink the income and/or wealth gap, what RESPONSIBILITIES do the people on the bottom have in order to achieve those goals?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@macauley_monica @LouDobbs Yes.  But wasting money is a pet peeves of mine.   Especially when it's the money being taken from me.  And under the guise it's for a good civic cause (schools, roads, police, Medicare, etc..).  And we pay people a lot of money to waste it.  Makes me angry.  https://t.co/x84fFIegM5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@macauley_monica @LouDobbs Correct.  Abuse is a MAJOR part of the problem.  Especially for tax payers.  Medicare alone has TENS OF BILLIONS of $$  wasted/stolen every year.

<|startoftext|>@VeganRoo @craftyvegangirl @Veganella_ No.  Your societal upbringing will dictate (to some degree) your perception of morality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Veganella_ @VeganRoo @craftyvegangirl "unnecessary" killing is also subjective.  Depends on the circumstances, IMO.  But you do make a good point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VeganRoo @craftyvegangirl @Veganella_ Yes.  The society you are in will dictate (to some degree) what you deem as moral or not.  Of course, times do change.  What society deems moral one day may very well change over time.  Right now, our society accepts people eating meat (even though you do not like it).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Veganella_ @VeganRoo @craftyvegangirl No argument here.  However, laws are sometimes based on what society seems immoral or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RelaxedMomma Yes.  We say exactly that.  "Too bad".🙄  Or, you can choose not to support that company with your business.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VeganRoo @craftyvegangirl @Veganella_ No.  Rape and pedophilia are not subjective to morality in the USA, in my opinion.  In my opinion, they are wrong.  We have laws against them.  In your opinion, eating meat is wrong.  We have no laws against that.  And our society accepts eating meat as okay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VeganRoo @craftyvegangirl @Veganella_ Pedophilia = I am against. Rape = I am against. In fact, we in the USA have laws against these. Violence towards those with less power is subjective.  Violence against mice in my house = yes.  Violence against a bird chirping in a tree =no.  Slaughtering a 🐖🐔🐄🍤 for food=yes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Quinntessence_ @beingkarmin My point was they did try.  A lame attempt, I yield that, but they did show an attempt.  And as far as it being a "Good" movie, well that's just a matter of taste.  However, I have 11 Oscars that say I'm right.😀<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ImJuliCaldwell @PlumleyLaurie Um.  Yes.  Criticism can be constructive.  That's why it's called CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM. 🙄.   And you can use it positively to help someone.

<|startoftext|>@BradfordJSmith1 @DariuszPops @PhiliChez @donmoyn @AOC It's a rough draft.  I also would make the first $25k earned tax free.  Numbers may need to be tweaked a bit.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BradfordJSmith1 @DariuszPops @PhiliChez @donmoyn @AOC I agree.  Tax code is very convoluted. I would go with a flat tax (with a hint of progression) and make interest, dividends and long term capital gains tax free for the first $5k for people making less than $250k per year.  My two cents.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DariuszPops @BradfordJSmith1 @PhiliChez @donmoyn @AOC I just explain the facts, dude.  I don't assume to know how stupid you are.  However, anyone advocating for a 70% rate cannot be that smart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradfordJSmith1 @PhiliChez @DariuszPops @donmoyn @AOC Depends.  The current tax brackets for 2019 have the top rate at 37%. Now, that's income tax.  Capital gains are taxes at a different rate.  20% is the top rate Long term (investments held for more than a year) for 2019.  Anything held for less than a year, is taxed as income.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhiliChez @BradfordJSmith1 @DariuszPops @donmoyn @AOC The proposed 70% rate is after the 10 mil.  And if you pay 37% on the first 10 mil ($3.7 mil) and then 70% on everything above it, once you hit about $18mil the government makes more than you. 3.7mil + 5.6mil = 9.3mil in taxes on $18mil earned. That sound right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradfordJSmith1 @DariuszPops @donmoyn @AOC Well, when you start coughing up 70% of your money you can come tell us how it feels.🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ATree87571299 @markmobility @MichaelDell @AOC @justicedems Yes that sound great.

<|startoftext|>@kzap333 @achorowitz No.  ILLEGAL immigrants are ALREADY breaking the law.  Hence, the "illegal" part of the phrase that you so conveniently like to omit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kzap333 @achorowitz So, then that would be someone who should be deported?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PaulRudnickNY No.  Hillary is probably still jealous because she thought she had the election in the bag and lost.  She will never be President.  I bet that stings.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CulturallyAlive Again, none of your blather points to the actions of a stupid person or idiot.  All of his alleged lying is perfectly legal.  Trump knows this.  Not the actions of an idiot.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CulturallyAlive Correct.  Pence was a good choice that made Trump palatable.  Would an IDIOT chosen Pence?  No.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CulturallyAlive Correct.  He put together a team and campaigned in a way to win key battleground states and get the electoral college votes needed to win.  Does that sound like a stupid person?  No, it does not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KB805 @Manny_Funes @BetoORourke @JoeBiden I'm not a troll.  My mother had me tested.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CulturallyAlive You can say the same about any elected official.  Ask the black community how 50 years of Democrats have helped them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CulturallyAlive Natural pendulum of things.  I fully expected a chamber to swing to the D's in the 2018 mid terms. I bet the Senate swings to D's in 2020 regardless if he wins then.  My hunch is he won't even run.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CulturallyAlive No. I said he was smart enough to get elected.  You sad he was STUPID or an IDIOT.  I say he is neither.  Do you like him? No.  Been following him since the 80's.  Didn't like him then, don't like him now.  I voted for him though.  He is NOT stupid. Say you hate him all you want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CulturallyAlive No.  Smart is getting elected in the first place.  Would he be the first elected official to LIE to win?  No.  He won't be the last.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KB805 @Manny_Funes @BetoORourke @JoeBiden He spent $70,000,000 and LOST.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Manny_Funes @BetoORourke @JoeBiden Beto spent $70,000,000 for a lousy Senate seat and lost.  What makes you think he can win the Presidency?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CulturallyAlive Perhaps he KNEW he couldn't build the wall but campaigned on it just to get elected.  That would make him the first President to fall short on a campaign promise?🤔. And wouldn't that action be considered smart?  Or, at the very least, shrewd?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MadeMeSayAwesomesauce This....  https://t.co/XRssBu3pfM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CulturallyAlive Negative.  Stupid people, or idiots, do not make it to the Presidency.  Does he say stupid things?  Yes.  How smart is he?  Don't know. For someone with the name "common sense", you should know this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@karenheff @humanistsue @AngelaH46601891 @SarcasticRover @JeriLRyan Telling someone not to reproduce is.  But, personal attacks aside, if you do not report bad activity there is no way bad people will be brought to justice.  "The only thing needed for evil to triumph is for good people to do nothing". Again, ASSUMING she is telling the truth.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AngelaH46601891 @karenheff @humanistsue @SarcasticRover @JeriLRyan Negative.  It's not some special victims club where anyone not a "victim" cannot have a say.  This was nothing like the church scandal.  This was 2 kids roughly the same age (15 and 17).  ASSUMING she is telling truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@karenheff @humanistsue @AngelaH46601891 @SarcasticRover @JeriLRyan Thank you, Karen.  Personal attacks aside, if you do not confront bad behaviour (at the very least) today you cannot expect a better world tomorrow.  IF what she says is true, more people could have been "abused" down the road.  Just like Weinstein.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@karenheff @humanistsue @AngelaH46601891 @SarcasticRover @JeriLRyan And what really steams my clams is that by NOT REPORTING it right away, she allows this type of behaviour to continue by the perpetrator.  Thus ADDING to society's problems.  ASSUMING she is telling the truth.  Same thing with this whole #MeToo movement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@karenheff @humanistsue @AngelaH46601891 @SarcasticRover @JeriLRyan That is correct  She brought this on herself by waiting so long to come forward.  ASSUMING she isn't "mixed up".  Either way, she lays down that giant victim card and cashes in, big time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@karenheff @AngelaH46601891 @humanistsue @SarcasticRover @JeriLRyan Again.  You keep playing the victim card.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@karenheff @AngelaH46601891 @humanistsue @SarcasticRover @JeriLRyan Ah yes, the victim card.  Seen it.  Read it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@karenheff @AngelaH46601891 @humanistsue @SarcasticRover @JeriLRyan Thats correct.  Which would explain why she didn't come forward right away.  Guilt.  Or, she could be one of those sadistic women that like to lead men on then turn off the spigot.  Just speculation .   There are dozens of possibilities.  That's ASSUMING he was even there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@karenheff @AngelaH46601891 @humanistsue @SarcasticRover @JeriLRyan I am assuming nothing.  A child, properly raised, would know to stand up for themselves.  I counter your point with this:  maybe she led him on?  Maybe she did not come forward because she started the whole encounter and it got out hand.  Not justifying that.  Just a thought.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngelaH46601891 @karenheff @humanistsue @SarcasticRover @JeriLRyan You'd be surprised.  And this lady is about to be up to her neck in it.  And, as I stated earlier, there is no way to prove for or against her.  But, I guarantee you, she cashes in.  Big time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@karenheff @humanistsue @AngelaH46601891 @SarcasticRover @JeriLRyan Exactly.  VICTIM.  VICTIM.  VICTIM. I'm a victim.  Your a victim.  He's a victim.  She's a victim.  Wouldn't you like to be a victim too? Well, in my opinion she is not a victim, but an opportunist.  IF what she's saying is true.  But, we will never find out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngelaH46601891 @karenheff @humanistsue @SarcasticRover @JeriLRyan Or I would beat the living crap out of the guy.  IF this is true.  We don't know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngelaH46601891 @karenheff @humanistsue @SarcasticRover @JeriLRyan If it were my daughter, then I would march her down to the police station and file a report.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngelaH46601891 @karenheff @humanistsue @SarcasticRover @JeriLRyan You have no idea the amount of money this woman is going to make from all this.  Tons.  The victim card is a cash cow in today's world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@karenheff @humanistsue @AngelaH46601891 @SarcasticRover @JeriLRyan She should have thought of the 35 YEARS ago when she DIDN'T file a police report IF what she is saying is true.  Had she done that, Kavanaugh would not have ascended up the ladder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngelaH46601891 @karenheff @humanistsue @SarcasticRover @JeriLRyan See my previous tweet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@karenheff @humanistsue @AngelaH46601891 @SarcasticRover @JeriLRyan No upside?  Sure there is.  This is going to come down to a "he said, she said" with nobody being able to prove anything.  Kavanaugh gets confirmed.  She then rakes in the cash playing the victim.  Talk shows.  Book deals.  You name it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MapleSpartan @SpeakerRyan No.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jlemonsk @SpeakerRyan What did Trump break?  I mean besides your crayons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenWarren So, you want to pass convoluted legislation further handcuffing American business and more companies overseas, who do not have this convoluted plan, are going prosper.  You have accomplished ZERO and made things worse here.  Brilliant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeriLRyan And my response here is the same as the original thread.  And the proof of this alleged attempted rape is WHAT?  Therapists notes about an event that supposedly happened 30 YEARS earlier?  In which the "victim" can't recall the house or how she got there? That's how dreams start.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@humanistsue @AngelaH46601891 @SarcasticRover @JeriLRyan Again.  Based on what? Allegations by one lady that are 35 YEARS old?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@humanistsue @AngelaH46601891 @SarcasticRover @JeriLRyan So, you know he is a rapist?  Based on what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AstralThespar @SarcasticRover @JeriLRyan Lol.  Yes it sure does.🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AstralThespar @SarcasticRover @JeriLRyan Polygraph tests not a reliable.  They can easily be beaten.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngelaH46601891 @SarcasticRover @JeriLRyan That's correct.  Innocent until proven guilty refers to a court of law.  But, then so does the definition of "rape".  Can't have it both ways.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarcasticRover @JeriLRyan No.  I will not shut my pie hole.  I have a right to doubt this woman's story.  I have a right to consider my fellow MAN innocent until proven guilty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarcasticRover @JeriLRyan And the proof of this alleged attempted rape is...?  What?  Some therapists notes from 2012 that state the person claims (some 20+ years ago)some people in an unknown house, in which they have no idea how they got there, were stumbling drunk and tried to take off their swimsuit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TailsP42069 @SarcasticRover @JeriLRyan She also had no recollection of where the house was nor how she got there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TailsP42069 @SarcasticRover @JeriLRyan The therapist’s notes, do not mention Kavanaugh’s name but say she reported that she was attacked by students “from an elitist boys’ school” who went on to become “highly respected and high-ranking members of society in Washington.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Schultz_Report It's early in the season.  They play 16 games in the NFL.  Plenty of time to turn things around.  And then the playoffs start.  That's when teams who hit their stride will shine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ryangrim @JeriLRyan So, going forward, to stop any nomination:  Troll a nominee's high school year book and find somebody to accuse them of something.  Deem that person as "credible" (by some magical credibility committee, I guess).  And stop any nomination process at any time, dead in its tracks.🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TailsP42069 @SarcasticRover @JeriLRyan No.  This is suspicious.  You wait until a few days before a vote after 35 YEARS to "come forward"?  So, now all that's required for any opposition to any appointment is to troll an appointee's high school year book in order to stop any nomination process.  That dog will not hunt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TailsP42069 @SarcasticRover @JeriLRyan No there isn't any probability of anything.  All that is known is some random woman comes out 35 YEARS later in an attempt to train wreck someone's job interview.  That is suspicious, at best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarcasticRover @JeriLRyan So, any woman can come out 35 YEARS down the road and train wreck anybody's job interview with some, unproven accusation?  Doesn't seem fair to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KimsMom3 @JeriLRyan No where in the Constitution does it mention driver a car.  Driving a car is a priviledge, not a right.  The right to bear arms, is a right.  Explicitly pointed out in the Constitution.<|endoftext|>
