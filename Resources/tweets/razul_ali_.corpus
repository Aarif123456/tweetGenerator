The only thing that has been a positive during this crisis was the furlough scheme.   Feel free to explain that the approx 40,000 deaths was not preventable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MixerPsg Boris taking a holiday during a crisis in February 2020.  Boris ignored medical advice at first by continuing to insist on shaking hands with people. Trying to downplaying Covid-19. Ironicall he got  Covid-19 himself.  The Dominic Cummings saga.  The Stay Alert guidance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MixerPsg Government wanting herd immunity.  Allowing sporting events like Cheltenham and Liverpool vs Madrid events to continue.   Lack of PPE stockpile for NHS staff.  Giving outdated PPE to NHS staff to use.  Ignoring the care homes and again PPE not being accessible to staff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MixerPsg Oh and over 100,000 covid related deaths in the United States, which were preventable. But you go  ahead and pretend that the liberals are more dangerous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MixerPsg What?!!? Are they more dangerous compared to the current government that has assisted with nearly 40,000 covid-19 related deaths. Oookkkk  https://t.co/3ThBjFnkwA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@melodyMcooper Why is it dangerous to be black in the US?? Calling the emergency services should be a powerful tool to give hope, peace of mind that everything will be ok; however, calling 911, for that number to be used as a weapon in the US can be a death sentence.
