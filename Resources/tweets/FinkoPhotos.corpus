<|startoftext|>I'm likely in the minority, but I miss the days of learning a dungeon. You wiped, you learned, then eventually succeeded. Had some laughs and made some friends along the way.

<|startoftext|>@RyanPekarek1 @Christinefor24 @AOC Not very much of that happening around my area. The hotlines aren't helpful, except to tell us to call police. My GF slept on a hospital floor for 3 nights when our son was brought to the ER. Social workers tried in vain to find a bed a local care facility for days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jjenjuno @Christinefor24 @AOC He's very well 'managed' on medications now and has regular counseling that our entire family participates in. I don't care if you don't like the term, but it is what it is. The other options are prison, long term care elsewhere, or for some families, far worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jjenjuno @Christinefor24 @AOC I speak from the perspective of a parent of a child on the spectrum (with a severe learning disability) who has had the police/ambulance respond to our home a dozen times for uncontrollable breakdowns. 3 that resulted in weeklong stays in special care facilities.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Christinefor24 @AOC With proper programs in place, you manage the person via medication and regular counseling,  so they don't escalate in the first place. No escalation. No crisis. No need to call police. This is where more social workers, programs and funding are needed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano With all due respect, the article relies on the reader's assumption that Trump hates foreigners in order to push the idea that the non-citizen clause is the reason the funds were put on hold.

<|startoftext|>@QuakeChampions Looks very much like q3dm6...and I'm not complaining :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder how many people walked into work this morning and gave their boss the middle finger after watching @NBCThisisUs last night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Apparently its been "imploding fast" for years now. Whatever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QuakeChampions done!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@POTUS Must really burn your ass to have to work on Obamacare 2.0.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Beast_Within920 @YouTube This is a great map. Did you play the first map Phobos Labs ? Both are pretty awesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hi @Syrkatrii   I would love if you would give my SnapMap, Static Entry,  a playthru. I think you will enjoy it!   https://t.co/lKW6v0khMM<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>No psvue service? Is it down? East Coast here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenKing I thought it sounded familiar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StodehTV @Twitch The first ime I read that I thought it said "To See Where They Live" and was like...the fuck?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HillaryClinton @DHSgov Two things he uses to stimulate his voter base.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Thanks for the update. I can sleep soundly now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@69News This way you can burn through your data allotment even faster!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SullivanTweet So, are you 7 feet tall or are they 4 feet tall ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@romero That song needs to burn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DOOM This doesn't look like a snapmap update to me..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DOOM Longest time between updates for Snapmap. Not a peep regarding future updates. Is @idSoftware @BethesdaStudios done with this one ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StodehTV "Console" - comfort (someone) at a time of grief or disappointment.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer You don't unpack that. You scoop it up and put in a bag.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump leakers...interesting choice of words<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DOOM looks great! Can we see it in Snapmap next?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't connect to @battlefield servers from east coast. Anyone else ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DOOM Done with SnapMap. 4 min load times to search for a needle in a haystack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I always wanted to be stuck in an alternate reality, like in the movies. Who knew it would come true ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenKing Love the "internets"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NocturnalGTX @YouTube This is a fun map. Just wish they would update the community spotlight more often.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DOOM So....about that SnapMap update ? Anything ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StodehTV @missellacronin It seems you have been living two lives...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arneduncan @BetsyDeVos Congress party lines spoke. Now the people they supposedly represent are speaking. Might want to listen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rweingarten @BetsyDeVos So you 'heard' something and thought it prudent to tweet it out to 68,000 followers. Well done...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Speaking and whining are two different things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DSenFloor @SenSchumer @SenWarren @washingtonpost Now there are rules...lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenKing Corps should invest that $ in their workforce. I doubt Bud profits would plummet w/o a Super Bowl ad for one year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mbCARMAC @QuakeChampions UT only because it will have the support of modders. QC isn't heading in that direction sadly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Checking  https://t.co/ygx7EYXwEV front page for story about Kellyanne Conway Bowling Green massacre story....and nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer rules schmules right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anxiously anticipating Trumps supreme court pick. My money is on Simon Cowell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmartNYT @RepCharlieDent also voted against aca repeal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@POTUS @realDonaldTrump Protection from house keeping and landscapers ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StodehTV I think this guy works in my I.T. department<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@romero I would like to try this just to see if it's as good as I remember. I like current WoW, but you can level up in your sleep. Too easy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@candacecbure She looks like a billion dollars....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StodehTV @IncredibleOrb Drain the Swamp.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DOOM It's been 8 months. Can we please be allowed to cut and paste a snapmap code into SnapMap? Is this brain surgery or something?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobVaughnNews  Hot air. Always has been from the start.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HillaryClinton I wonder what Trump's tweet would have looked like today if things were reversed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It feels like one of those bad scify B movies where someone went back in time an altered our timeline.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will not buy @QuakeChampions without a proper level editor. I see no point. Don't call it Quake if mod support isn't extended to players.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenKing can we consider the Hindenburg a float?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stereospell @DOOM @idSoftware I wish this feature would come to SnapMap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenKing Frightening how easily be gets trolled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was not a big fan of SnapMaps module system, but I do like being able to focus solely on gameplay &amp; atmosphere  when making a map.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DOOM Insert shameless plug:  https://t.co/kmmqrm5pRZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DOOM Fix the rating system. Finding good maps is total hell (no pun intended) in SnapMap. Add bots support to DM maps. Everything is empty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Merginator @DOOM @YouTube I sure hope it does :) Has a 100% approval rating so far. I have to think some of those play thrus were Xbox.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @VanityFair wtf are you babbling about now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seems like there are more people making Snapmaps than playing them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DOOM I have 2 maps combined 200-6 rating (97%), yet they get .25% number of play thrus vs a map that hands out Snap Points.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DOOM Latest SnapMap improvements are great, but rating system is still a complete mess.   Exposure != Quality  Please get this fixed!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DOOM Does the weapon wheel mean the end of the 2 gun limit? 2 guns at a time is a real hindrance for a SP experience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DOOM Thanks for the details on the snapmap updates. I will def hold off on releasing the level that I'm working on. 2 gun limit is a pain.<|endoftext|>
