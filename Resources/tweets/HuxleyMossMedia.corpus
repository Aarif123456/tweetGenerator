<|startoftext|>Is this appropriate, @9NewsAUS ? Your chief political reporter often bags others on Twitter for abusive comments ‚Ä¶ @CUhlmann<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oz_f Agree. That said, remember that to try to make the Americans understand ‚Äì &amp; act ‚Äì they need to identify with the people behind a successful strategy.

<|startoftext|>@The_Filbo @BrexitBin @ColouredView If I were to follow the practice you describe. In your bio, Brext Bin, I would block your followers who are heaping abuse on me. Ad hominem attacks rather than rational argument. Do you think I should block them?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mad_cyclist @BrexitBin @ColouredView Personal abuse? Really? That‚Äôs no argument.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrexitBin You can call anyone a fascist, bot or troll so you can block them. You clearly don‚Äôt want to hear alternate views. I‚Äôm all for blocking abuse, calls for violence etc. but believe we need to listen to legit views even if we disagree. Btw: I thought UK should have remained.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrexitBin @ColouredView Your bio basically says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to hear alternate views. Anyone who challenges me is a troll, moron, partisan ... and I‚Äôll block them‚Äù.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jommy_tee ? What‚Äôs this? Is it a teaser for an investigative report (in which you reveal there IS a document)? Is is just marketing Evil Morrison (which I would applaud)?

<|startoftext|>@euanblackwrites @MichaelPascoe01 @TheNewDailyAu The role of the press gallery ‚Äì as enabler of hypocrisy, as captured tool of the political class ‚Äì is a crucial aspect of this story. How can they hold power to accnt if we can‚Äôt trust them to tell us the truth abt our elected reps? We need to know journalists are on OUR side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterCronau Agree. But the press gallery has been captured by this government. Political journalism in the infamous ‚Äúbubble‚Äù has become transactional. Exclusive drops from the PMO are rewarded with protection from scrutiny. We‚Äôre seeing that happen now. The MSM won‚Äôt help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billisdoing @MargaretSimons @Gay_Alcorn @theage Someone senior would still have to have read the piece and signed off on the headline. Surely they could see it was misleading/wrong. Unless it was deliberate? Hope not.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MargaretSimons @Gay_Alcorn Welcome, yes. But why did it take a Twitter revolt to fix it? And why was the headline ‚Äì clearly wrong ‚Äì allowed to go through in the first place? Misleading headlines are not uncommon at Nine newspapers these days. Needs fixing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LovingNaturista @lovinlife311 @PalmerReport They‚Äôre asking for donations to mount the law suits but the fine print in the letters asking for money from supporters says it can be used to repay Trump‚Äôs campaign debt.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ktibus @blasphemybunny @theage Yes. But I suspect there‚Äôs more going on.

<|startoftext|>@Christi31251088 @meadea Exactly my position, @Christi31251088. Accept fault for mistakes but get credit for success. Morrison is all marketing/image, no responsibility.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@T____R @meadea @AusFedPolice @GuardianAus Exactly. It‚Äôs a strategy used by the Putin‚Äôs Internet Research Agency to spread disinfo in western democracies: sow disinfo into the msm via ‚Äúlegitimate‚Äù platforms. Journos &amp; political staffers are often targeted in this way. I suspect ‚Äì and hope ‚Äì the matter is now with ASIO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidmweissman @marcorubio @JoshuaHol  Reminds me of the line ‚ÄúNot all Republicans are racist, wife-beating white supremacists but all racist, wife-beating white supremacists are Republicans‚Äù.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@T____R @meadea @AusFedPolice It‚Äôs dodgy as. This is a serious breach of journalism standards, ministerial responsibility and democratic process. And possibly a breach of national security.  Who was behind the creation of the fake doc? Hope @GuardianAus continues to investigate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FreddoFrog11 @Christi31251088 @meadea Exactly. Which is why the decision to shut down an investigation (without even interviewing the minister) is suspicious. There must be a way to see how the fake doc was at least introduced to the minister‚Äôs office.  @AusFedPolice, please explain this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@9NewsMelb @jekearsley ‚Ä¶ thanks to @ScottMorrisonMP‚Äôs inept handling of our relationship with our biggest trade partner. And it‚Äôs not just lobsters. Education, barley, beef and wine, too. This will all add to the Morrison Recession.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@andrewkeates @JaneyGodley Just wait. There‚Äôll be more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@T____R @meadea Understand that. But there seems to be solid grounds for a proper investigation and questions need to be asked of the @AusFedPolice  about why they didn‚Äôt pursue a proper investigation. Shouldn‚Äôt they want us to trust that they are not partisan?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bennoba @MediaActive @zalisteggall @australian @newscorpaus If that was the intention (I think it clearly wasn‚Äôt) it was a poor attempt, requires too much existing knowledge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bennoba @MediaActive @zalisteggall @australian @newscorpaus I teach satire: it can also be racist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bennoba @MediaActive @zalisteggall @australian @newscorpaus You‚Äôre hilarious. You keep trying to find new ways to justify your racism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bennoba @MediaActive @zalisteggall @australian @newscorpaus Apologies for not getting back to you sooner. I wanted to spend time with the family yesterday instead of yet again explaining to someone why they don‚Äôt understand that they are racist. Have a nice day. 11/11<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bennoba @MediaActive @zalisteggall @australian @newscorpaus I teach my students to be aware of these kinds of flawed arguments/logic and to avoid them. I doubt you‚Äôll be persuaded by my argument; you‚Äôll stick to your emotion-based position because it‚Äôs fundamental to your world view. A racist world view. 10/11<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bennoba @MediaActive @zalisteggall @australian @newscorpaus Lots of people do these things unwittingly for various reasons. You‚Äôve made these logical errors because of a fundamental racism; you‚Äôve twisted the meaning of someone‚Äôs words in order to defend a racist opinion.  9/11<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bennoba @MediaActive @zalisteggall @australian @newscorpaus What you did is also a case of ‚Äúmotivated reasoning‚Äù: social psychologists define this as the use of emotion-based reasoning to justify a position not supported by the evidence. 8/11<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bennoba @MediaActive @zalisteggall @australian @newscorpaus To try to justify the cartoon by mischaracterising Biden‚Äôs words suggests a racist intent. Why not attack her record as a prosecutor or her voting record as a Senator rather than her race? Because racism. 7/11<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bennoba @MediaActive @zalisteggall @australian @newscorpaus You‚Äôve used a fallacy to mischaracterise Biden‚Äôs words in order to defend a racist opinion. Why? Because you are racist. You clearly don‚Äôt think you are racist. That‚Äôs why I suggested you look deep inside and be honest with yourself. I still urge you to do that. 6/11<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bennoba @MediaActive @zalisteggall @australian @newscorpaus To argue ‚Äúbut those are Biden‚Äôs words‚Äù so it‚Äôs ok to use them in a different context is to mischaracterise the meaning and intent of his words. They‚Äôve been used to belittle Harris‚Äôs race. In reasoning, this use of incorrect logic is called a fallacy. 5/11<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bennoba @MediaActive @zalisteggall @australian @newscorpaus Biden didn‚Äôt call Kamala Harris ‚Äúa little brown girl‚Äù, as the cartoon suggests. The ‚Äúgirls‚Äù he referred to are the children he believes will be inspired by a role model they don‚Äôt see at that level of politics. 4/11<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bennoba @MediaActive @zalisteggall @australian @newscorpaus (Also: ‚Äúlittle girl‚Äù is sexist and Biden going for a lie-down is ageist. Leak doesn‚Äôt stick to just one form of bigotry.) 3/11<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bennoba @MediaActive @zalisteggall @australian @newscorpaus To refer to a grown woman of colour using the phrase ‚Äúlittle brown girl‚Äù is demeaning and belittling, of her race and gender. Harris  is an accomplished career woman. To refer to her colour rather than her track record is a classic racist strategy.  2/11<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bennoba @MediaActive @zalisteggall @australian @newscorpaus Let‚Äôs do this in a few steps: Why the cartoon is racist Why your defence of the cartoon is not valid Why your defence of the cartoon is racist Why that suggests that you are racist Why you did it 1/11<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MargaretSimons @PeterKlages This is a 360 review process. We get to report on the performance of journalists.

<|startoftext|>Hey #twitterati. @david_speers on #insiders says our opinion is worthless, dismisses opinions expressed on Twitter. Thoughts? How can we get him to take us seriously?#auspol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Insiders gets sucked in about the cyber hacking story. Been going on for months, no detail, so why mention now? To deflect from uni cuts? To deflect from worse employment figures? Wake up, @david_speers! #auspol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So when Bowen mentions stacking by Turnbull @david_speers says ‚Äúbut it wasn‚Äôt on the same scale‚Äù, defending his #Coalition mates. This after demanding Bowen answer whether Somurek was booted for the stacking &amp; asking how much stacking is acceptable to Labor!  #insiders #auspol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My question to you @David_Speers is have you been bought off by the #Coalition or are you trashing good journalism practice for ideologicial reasons? #auspol #insiders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So yet again  @david_speers follows the gotcha questioning line supplied by the #Coalition. Well done, ABC. Fair and balanced, public interest, impartial journalism. Clap, clap, clap.  #insiders  #auspol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse Hahahahahahaha.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@David_Speers So why tweet this instead of about the govt fcking over the poor by making uni less accessible, or the unemployment jump or any other signif issue? You got played. Or you deliberately gave cover to the govt ‚Äî yet again. #thisisnotjournalism #auspol<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gregprichard @KnottMatthew @Ageinvestigates @theage @Kate_McClymont I think the point is people want McKenzie et al‚Äôs skills applied to other clear cases of dodgy behaviour, not just to target one side of politics. Otherwise they‚Äôre doing the govt‚Äôs dirty work. Do you not think many Coalition politicians have a case to answer but are ignored?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brianstelter Don‚Äôt have #Trump liars and obfuscators on your shows! They don‚Äôt want truth or debate, they want to confuse &amp; attack &amp; put you on the defensive.

<|startoftext|>Jesus @David_Speers. Is it your job to shut down criticism of the govt? Why do that?

You‚Äôre a joke, not a journalist. #insiders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@David_Speers  Re your intro: why did police ‚Äúhave to‚Äù use pepper spray at Central Station? Why not just say ‚Äúpolice used pepper spray‚Äù? Think about your language and what it means about your approach to the issue. #auspol #insiders #abcinsiders<|endoftext|>
