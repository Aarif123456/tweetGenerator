<|startoftext|>Gussie Finknottle - sorry, Oliver Dowden - says Australia is a major economy that does a large amount of trade with the EU.

<|startoftext|>@melb4886 No but I think the EU has around 80 FTAs around the world if you include the provisional ones so those need to be renegotiated or duplicated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Early this morning #5live News was calling it "so-called Australian terms" but without telling listeners that the only person who calls it that is Johnson.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hawkins_carole Nobody has yet said that any activity will be conditional on being vaccinated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People can make all the nuanced or convoluted arguments they like in defence of Labour's abstention last night but there can be no doubt that Starmer handed the Tories an early Christmas present. #PoliticsLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Talk of vaccinations makes me reflect on the oddity that I'm perfectly happy to have a needle stuck in my arm but would be incapable of injecting someone else. Even the thought of doing so makes me woozy. ü•¥ (Not the only reason I didn't become a doctor).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lies unlikely to be mentioned on #PoliticsLive. Hope a Labour MP raises it with Hancock when he makes his statement in the #Commons. @BBCPolitics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hancock lying earlier when he said we could approve the vaccine quicker because we we'd left the #EU. Dr June Raine at the briefing said opposite is true - it was fast because we're still in the transition period &amp; had EU cooperation. #vaccination #Pfizer #BBCNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ninnytothree In recent years they've stopped saying that and to avoid any double entendre they say 'just a little scratch'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With the vaccine approval the phrase "Just a little prick" will soon ring out across the land. In the meantime here's Matt Hancock.......#r4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Evilgenius222 It would just end up in the same graveyard as all the other new parties of recent times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bitgit He hates taking calls from the plebs on his #LBC show, can't be bothered to engage with them, and takes fewer than any other presenter. A very arrogant person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bitgit Yes, it particularly happens when Matt Frei is the anchor*.  *Rhyming slang? If you want it to be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Editors of #C4News seem to have adopted Mrs Merton's mantra "Let's have a heated debate" rather than just concentrate on informing their viewers. It won't surprise me if someone from the Flat Earth Society appears one evening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gildy61 His emotion may well have been genuine but as you say Tories' compassion is always very selective. Easy to be anguished about close family; decent people also feel empathy with those they don't know who are suffering.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No lack of idiots on the Labour benches either. One just asked what about people with other conditions like cancer? As Hancock rightly replied, less chance of them getting treated if hospitals are overflowing with Covid patients. #Commons<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SueBarnish I never imagined 50 years ago that his kind of reactionary, brain-dead shire Tory would still be in the Commons in 2020.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Tory MP Tim Loughton (1st Class degree in Classical Civilisation) is another one making the classically fatuous comparison of Covid-19 with seasonal flu. When did flu kill over 600 #NHS staff or leave huge numbers with debilitating and serious long-term conditions? #LBC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>"Everyone's lovin' it when we hit the road". I've developed an intense hatred for the young bloke in the Electric Mini radio ad, even though I know he's just a voice-over artist trying to earn some money to pay his rent by reading a copywriter's deranged witterings. üò†<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hilarious interview with Robinson in the new Radio Times in which he boasts of his total impartiality.

<|startoftext|>This is true. In my early working life, at a time when it was taken less seriously, I've seen victims of workplace bullying in tears including young people in their first job who were especially vulnerable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tory MP Miriam Cates has the brass neck to go on #BBCNews and say the report on Priti Patel found no evidence of bullying behaviour when that is exactly what  Sir Alex Allan found and stated in his report.  Sorry, I know Tories lying isn't really noteworthy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This argument Johnson has made in defence of Priti Patel that "concerns were not raised at the time" is the same argument that has often been used in relation to victims of sexual abuse and rape. #BBCNews #LBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How easy will it be to recruit a replacement for Sir Alex Allan as Independent Adviser on the Ministerial Code? If their advice and reports can just be rejected what's the point of having such a post? #BBCNews #LBC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PatHarkin7 Unfortunately, despite riding on Rashford's coat tails Labour has so far refused to back his wider campaign to #EndChildPoverty and to fully implement the report by Henry Dimbleby.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Tories suddenly being 5 points behind Labour in a new poll is more likely down to Marcus Rashford and the Government's response to his campaign than to Keir Starmer. The latter has failed to significantly eat into the Tory poll lead for months.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Currently some "journalists" on #5live are saying Starmer didn't resign from the Shadow team under Corbyn.  But he did! Admittedly, he went back in later because Corbyn was magnanimous enough to give jobs to his enemies, including Owen Smith who stood against him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jon_trace @graham_r @bbc5live You lie. Corbyn never said it was "small fry". He said even one case was unacceptable. But it's incontrovertible that the number of Labour members accused of anti-semitism was greatly exaggerated and weaponised, something condemned by many Jews.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@magmogz135 It's always said to be a good liar you need a good memory so you can remember what you said previously.......in Starmer's case 10 minutes previously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the #5live phone-in someone is getting away with saying Corbyn rejected the ECHR report when in reality he said he accepted all their recommendations and wanted to see them implemented. #YourCall @bbc5live<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@90percenters Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Starmer says he made a difficult decision yesterday. Earlier in the interview he said the decision was made by the General Secretary. Make your fucking mind up mate! #r4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The usual defenders of Starmer seem quiet on Twitter at the moment. Maybe they realise their man has fucked up badly today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was going to avoid all tonight's news programmes but glad I caught Andrew Feinstein's wise words on #C4News. If Labour is to be consistent he too should now be suspended. Let's see if Starmer has the guts to get into a fight with a Jewish man over anti-semitism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The problem with saying "Stay and fight" to socialists in the Labour Party is that they may not have the choice to stay. It's been made clear that speaking the truth that the scale of anti-semitism was exaggerated and that the issue was weaponised is grounds for expulsion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bobbidog @UKLabour It's like you haven't read his statement in which he expressed regret that improving the party's processes took longer than it should have done. As a lifelong campaigner against anti-semitism Corbyn has nothing to personally apologise for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There was no denial by Jeremy Corbyn that some anti-semitism existed in the party. But if anyone thinks the scale of it wasn't exaggerated they should not just smell the coffee but give themselves a slap, preferably a hard one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh for fuck's sake, Corbyn has been suspended from the Labour Party. Thank god I left this shitshow of a party. What a nest of vipers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those in the media demanding that Starmer expel Corbyn seem unaware they're contradicting the EHRC Report which says there should be no political interference in the party's disciplinary processes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trueclausefour And sister of #C4News presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy. The inter-connections within the media and politics are remarkable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eljefe_david_c It's not an issue that the EHRC did or could address. All Starmer had to say was 'No'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@debswj62 You seem to have great faith in the EHRC so do you think they will ever do an investigation into the endemic racism and Islamophobia in the Tory Party and the way that party handles complaints?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eljefe_david_c Lawyer? He's a politician who is Leader of the Labour Party! Unfortunately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Totally impartial #BBCNews presenter Guru-Murthy suggests that Starmer could remove the whip from Corbyn and calls Corbyn's statement this morning "utterly extraordinary".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Do you think Jeremy Corbyn is personally anti-semitic?" Starmer: "There is no finding of anti-semitism against Jeremy Corbyn in the report". What a disgustingly mealy-mouthed reply.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At Starmer's news conference the media are clamouring for Corbyn to be thrown out the Labour Party but I very much doubt that even that would satisfy them now.  A truly sickening spectacle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>O'Brien interviewed a former Labour member who had moved his family to Israel as soon as Corbyn became party leader. O'Brien didn't ask the obvious question: what did he think lifelong campaigner against anti-semitism Corbyn was going to do to Jewish people? #LBC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Now it's Rocco Forte allowed to talk absolute garbage on Covid unchallenged in the #r4today business slot: Nobody 'forecast 500,000 deaths'.

<|startoftext|>We've long had the "racist grandparents" trope (popular with unfunny comedians) but now Uncles are regularly demonised too. Woman on #5live just referred to 'obnoxious uncles". Declaration of interest: I'm an uncle, but not I hope obnoxious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is Webb going to point out that this is only an issue in England? The other UK nations are continuing the free school meals scheme until Easter at a minimum.  And why do Tories put Zahawi out so often? Do they really think the public are impressed by him? #r4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Marcus Rashford isn't just "interested" in Henry Dimbleby's proposals as Kearney says, they're at the centre of Rashford's campaign.

<|startoftext|>Since Hancock has mentioned the number of #NHS hospital beds it's worth remembering that since 2010 the Tories have cut the number of hospital beds by more than 17,000. We could do with those 17,000 beds now. #r4today<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Clear from that interview that Tory MP Tim Loughton doesn't give a shit about the children but is angry about his party's PR disaster. And another Tory MP came out with the classic that with hindsight he should have abstained on the vote. Abstained! #C4News<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking at something on #NHS website I noticed this: "Physiotherapy and podiatry may not be available for free on the NHS everywhere and waiting times can be long.

<|startoftext|>"MPs voted against extending free school meals" says BBC's Ben Brown on News at One in his report on Marcus Rashford, carefully avoiding mentioning that it was MPs from one particular party who voted against, with only about five exceptions. #ToryScum #BBCNews @BBCNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Catching up with #PresidentialDebate. It's true that Trump didn't talk over Biden so much this time but the reports I heard this morning didn't say how much he shouted over the woman moderator. I mention her gender because maybe that's relevant where Trump's concerned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlecHitchman1 The last Chancellor fell out with Cummings and was gone. Ambishi Rishi eagerly stepped into his shoes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rjcruthers Well put. But it was glossed over that it's the private sector contact tracing that is failing abysmally. I think local authority tracing is reaching about 94%. #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Impossible to have any trust in people like Vallance who stand next to Johnson and self-censor what they say. I don't recall it being said months ago that Test &amp; Trace was only effective when cases were low. A 'world-beating' Test &amp; Trace was the Holy Grail. #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're communicating to a mass audience in a national emergency it's basic stuff that you shouldn't use terms like Scylla and Charybdis. But of course Johnson knows that such stuff makes some of his fans believe he's terribly clever. (He's not). #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@snowleopardess Which holidays? Only until Spring 2021 you just told me. Not the same as what Rashford is asking for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@snowleopardess Exactly! A short-term fix. But Rashford is campaigning for a permanent change. Labour are not currently backing that. Why can't you see the difference?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@snowleopardess Er, Green is Labour's Shadow Secretary of State for Education!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@feistywomankent @DrJoGrady @ucu That may well be true but my comment was in response to that University interviewee saying the number of infections had surprised them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If universities had looked across the Atlantic at the level of infections that had already happened on US campuses they might not have been so surprised. I believe US universities and colleges have now had over 300,000 infections. #r4today<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The Star front page actually made me laugh this morning with its take on the Matt Hancock allegations: BEERS OF A CLOWN.

<|startoftext|>Infections and deaths rising at an alarming rate in America. A couple of days ago deaths stood at 210,000. Today: almost 214,000.  Meanwhile, the White House has just blocked attempts to make masks compulsory on public transport.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hilarious to hear right-wing dipsticks like Andrew Castle talking about an erosion of civil liberties in the context of the pandemic. Usually the very term "civil liberties" would have them frothing at the mouth. #LBC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Today the Trump campaign has called members of the independent Presidential Debates Commission "swamp creatures" and Trump himself has called Senator Kamala Harris a "monster" and a "Communist". These are sad and dark days for American politics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tudortweet A jaw-dropping thing was that Pence twice quoted at Harris the famous line "You're entitled to your opinion but not to your own facts." Imagine how many times a day he'd need to say that to Trump! #VicePresidentialDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll pass if it's all the same to you. The mildest criticism of O'Brien and both he and his radio station blocked me on Twitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe I'm even more weird than these politicians and Chatterati because I didn't find the #VicePresidentialDebate boring at all. #PoliticsLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To be fair to Pence he's an equal opportunities kind of guy. Last night he talked over both a white woman and a black woman. #PoliticsLive #VicePresidentialDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PoliticsLive put up a caption saying new BBC DG Tim Davie was privately educated and went to Cambridge. Curiously they omitted to say he was also a Tory activist and election candidate.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sturgess_steve There's no excuse because we saw on TV examples from other countries of what a real lockdown looks like.  Maybe #r4today contacted the wrong kind of 'computer modeller' and he makes models of computers out of matchsticks.üòÑüòÑ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This computer modeller is another who thinks that earlier we "locked down everybody". We never had a meaningful lockdown. Even those of us in 'shielding' category had to go food shopping at the start because it took weeks for other options to kick in. #r4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The weird thing about the Royals' love of wildlife is that it coexists with a love of killing it, whether it's using dogs to rip foxes apart or blasting birds out the sky. That's as true of William as of his father and grandfather. #r4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump's behaviour more erratic than usual today (if that's possible) raising concerns, reports #CNN, that his medication has affected his state of mind. Hope they're keeping him away from those nuclear codes.üò±<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's the little things, the small editorial decisions, like starting today's programme with a clip of a Republican accusing Biden of running scared of a second debate. #r4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Strong speech by Biden at Gettysburg now. His pitch is to unite the country and heal divisions, a message that may resonate with some of the undecideds. One of the things he name-checks is Stonewall. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>One of the most offensive things in that ridiculous rhetorical rodomontade from #Johnson, which Kuenssberg put in her report, was his comparison with the Attlee Government's post-war achievements. He didn't of course say that was a Labour Government. #BBCNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Particularly absurd given that Biden is a Catholic!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Sorry Schmoozer Sunak, the small problem with "Live fearlessly but with common sense" is that it makes no fucking sense. It's common sense to be fearful of a highly contagious virus that has killed over 50,000 people and left many more with long-term conditions. #r4today<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Mental health services were already on their knees and waiting lists for elective surgery had gone through the roof after 10 years of Tory cuts before Covid-19 existed but only now do those on the right become concerned about it because it suits another agenda. #PoliticsLive<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>After a Minister came unstuck on #r4today you'd expect the Prime Minister to have been all over the minutiae of the North East regulations when he met the press later. But this is Boris Johnson we're talking about so if you did you haven't followed his career. #Misspoke<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Heard caller to radio say Govt should tell people not to wear masks outside.

<|startoftext|>The New York Times' revelations of Trump's tax affairs became the headlines on #BBCNews. Yet not a dickie bird today about the #C4News revelations last night of the Trump campaign's attempts at voter deterrence in the 2016 election. #r4today @BBCr4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting piece but this sentence made me laugh: "it‚Äôs thought that GB News will mirror the London-based radio station LBC, by employing presenters with a range of views." üò≤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This #C4News revelation about voter deterrence by the Trump campaign in 2016 comes just as I'm reading Peter Geoghegan's excellent recent book Democracy For Sale which has much on 'digital gangsterism' both in the U.S. and the U.K. Highly recommended.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BlackBob1952 @LeftieStats So long as you ignore the same day's Delta poll which has the Tories 4 points ahead......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting that the Mail today buried their own poll finding of a 4 point Tory lead and instead headlined the Observer's poll showing a 3 point Labour lead. They must have really fallen out of love with Johnson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man in charge of the app had been booked to appear with Tom Swarbrick on #LBC today. This morning he cancelled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Car crash interview by an unbriefed Oliver Dowden, who is also Minister for Digital, about the flawed test and trace app on #LBC. Like Manuel, he know nothing. Passed the buck to Hancock.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A member of SAGE told #LBC this week that SAGE had never discussed closing pubs at 10pm so Dowden is being a little, er, disingenuous in saying it was based on scientific advice. #Marr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absurd for Marr to say Spitting Image only went for right-wing targets. I well remember their Neil Kinnock and the literally spitting Roy Hattersley. #Marr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the other hand, the Mail's poll (not mentioned on #Marr) has Tories on 42%, four points ahead of Labour. Polling margin of error is 3%. Looking at both polls it's probably fair to say the parties are pretty much level-pegging.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@asymetricjockey That puts us both on the naughty step then........according to some. üòÑ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bonnevilloise Not true. I've often commented on Boris Johnson's appearance and that of many other people too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Sun is claiming that pubs will be made to close at 10pm. The benefits of that must be very marginal. Today someone told me they've seen the bar area tightly packed with people with zero distancing at one of our village pubs on weekend nights. #LBC #BBCNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chief Scientific Adviser stated categorically that increase in infection wasn't because of more testing. Then BBC's Nick Triggle pops up on 1pm TV News and says the opposite. Not the first time he's downplayed the pandemic. Someone needs to have a word. @BBCNews #BBCNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cinnamontoastuk That's true but it shouldn't mean a total ban on commenting on a woman's appearance unless the comment is clearly motivated by misogyny - which mine wasn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cinnamontoastuk There's also a 'relentless focus' on Johnson's appearance. Same was true for Corbyn. So please don't play that card at me.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Chris_and_D @Cmacg3 They've announced ¬£500 for everyone isolating who is receiving Universal Credit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Idiotic for Starmer to say (as he did on #Ridge) that the SNP are talking about a referendum instead of the pandemic. It's possible to do both and Sturgeon has given far better leadership on the pandemic than Johnson and the UK Government. #Marr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hancock said over 200,000 people are being tested every day. I think he gave a recent figure although the Government doesn't publish a figure for PEOPLE tested. Their dashboard gives 'tests processed' and says this "may include multiple tests for an individual person". #Marr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sophy Ridge tried to extract some defining principles of his leadership and some concrete policies from Keir Starmer and all she got was "listening to people....anti-semitism....listening to people....anti-semitism.....listening to people......Let's see how #Marr gets on. #Ridge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Papers report that No 10 is alarmed by the numbers breaking the isolation rules.

<|startoftext|>People can make up any figure they want about the number of people tested daily (Tory Gillian Keegan just said 300,000) because the Government stop releasing the figure months ago after the ONS said the figures were flawed [fiddled]. #PoliticsLive #PMQs<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Harsher penal policy is Johnson shoring up his base in a  Trumpian way and gives the lie to those claims "he's really a metropolitan liberal".

<|startoftext|>Where has this Chair of the Royal Colleges got the figure that 220,000 people a day are being tested? The Government stopped publishing the number of people tested months ago. I think the Sunday Times investigation reckoned the figure is less than 80,000. #C4News<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sturgess_steve Best you don't read Guardian's Andrew Sparrow then: "the outstanding Commons speech of this parliament - clear, forensic, witty and above all compelling.

<|startoftext|>He didn't pursue the point but Ian Blackford mentioned that the Queen would be asked to sign a Bill that allowed her Government to break the law. The Queen has some residual powers to intervene if a Government acts illegally but it's unlikely she'd do so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bluecatsarah @EdMilliband At one point Johnson appeared not to recognise his own words from his recent Telegraph article. To be fair to him, it might have been written by Cummings.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jomacly I was quoting the Telegraph's lead story, not Starmer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Telegraph (Starmer's favourite paper in which he has another article today) reports the Government is considering "opt-outs of the Human Rights Act".

<|startoftext|>Useful reminder there that it's always been the case that far more people holiday in the UK than overseas (of those who can afford to holiday at all) contrary to "everyone has overseas holidays now"...."everyone blah blah..." "everyone owns a blah blah..." #r4today<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>At 06.10 Nick Robinson has a pop at Ben &amp; Jerry's, suggesting they were capitalising on the hot weather to get publicity. "Just a thought" he says. Another 'Just a thought': they might, like all decent people, be appalled at Patel's attitude to asylum seekers. #r4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Novalaisienne Petrichor is a name given to the smell. Geosmin is the chemical released by bacteria that causes the smell. Another tropical night here in the southern UK too but with any luck the last one.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>A short burst of rain has produced the pleasing smell of Geosmin, a chemical released by dead soil bacteria after storms. One of nature's most wonderful smells. Humans are hyper-sensitive to it, thought to be because in the past it helped us to find water.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#C4News also out filming in the Channel today but trying to claim the high moral ground by throwing bottles of water to a boat and pretending they were helping to rescue them. There'll soon be more film crews out in the Channel than asylum seekers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tonight #C4 start repeating the first series of Shameless which exploded on our screens like a life-affirming firework in 2004. Terrific cast and an unusually realistic portrayal of a young, working-class gay teenager with not a gay stereotype to be seen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidagoodland Just found loads on Amazon. I've probably assumed that battery-operated are more accurate, at least until they abruptly stop.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This from Times caught my eye: "The Government has admitted for the first time it may not have enough jabs to fulfil the NHS's aim to vaccinate 30 million people." Logistics of doing it also a concern. #BBCNews #r4today<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Pleased that Starmer has tweeted in support of Dawn Butler. But he did so in oddly impersonal, lawyerly language saying "our support" not "my support" and that the abuse she's getting "must be condemned" not "I condemn it".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#r4today now on its third long item on people crossing the Channel. I think we should call this particular dead cat Stakhanov. It's putting in quite a shift.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sturgess_steve @sheilaRNBD I've heard several callers to LBC in the last few days say they should be put in internment camps. One man added reassuringly that he didn't want them to be like Nazi concentration camps but they should be in The North. (He lived in the South).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only first 50 minutes of #r4today and we've already got their second item on the people* crossing the Channel in small boats.  *I'm deliberately calling them people. All the other terms seem to obscure that fact, often deliberately.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LexDavies3 Could have been. It was when Greg Dyke was D.G at the BBC. He said it was the programme he was most proud of.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidagoodland Myself and a bunch of mates were let off for the same thing, even though some of us were drunk and the driver told the copper he was a class traitor. Mind you, I'm going back a bit. That was in 1968. üòÑ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've never forgotten a small but significant thing in an undercover BBC documentary on police racism some years ago. A police officer said if he stopped a white person for a brake light not working he'd tell them to get it fixed. But he'd always give a ticket to a black driver.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@delrudd My mother very sensibly stopped driving, I think in her late seventies, when she realised her reactions were slowing down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piscisaustralis My mother took me to Paris around that time and I too wore my state grammar school uniform throughout the holiday, including a school cap, which made me an object of interest to the French. Seems bizarre now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@asymetricjockey You seem not to have noticed me stressing that I said SOME older drivers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Went in the garden to do some dead-heading and found I was holding a shoe horn instead of scissors. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I think the neurological automatic pilot that we all rely on goes on the blink more often as you age.

<|startoftext|>@broncoskolar I'm sure it is but totally inappropriate in this context.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it my ears or has Glen Hoddle just discovered the verb 'purvey'? "A wonderful purveyed ball" [A good pass]. Second time he's said it tonight. #FCBCHE #BTSport<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In the context of the people crossing the Channel from France to seek asylum I sometimes think those of us who are atheists are more likely to ask 'What would Jesus say?' than many who self-identify as Christians.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For want of any hard news to discuss #5live is doing a phone-in on 'the trainers in your life'. üôÑ In my case that would be none. Next week: 'your favourite flip-flops'. #YourCall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MagpiesView And guys who beat me up because of my politics or my footie team get a lesser sentence than those who do it because I'm gay. My gut reaction is to support that but my head says that is also wrong. A beating up is a beating up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveH96899945 @MisfitClyde But it's not a higher standard of protection while on duty. That would come if the Government funded police and other public services properly. Sentencing policy has no deterrent effect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Krishnan: 'So you're not worried about Brexit?' Bank of England Governor: 'I worry about lots of things' - roars with laughter. Economic armageddon is such fun. In an earlier interview the Governor appointed by the Tory Government said he fully supports Government policy. #C4News<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whilst I understand the grief &amp; anger of victims' families  I don't like the idea of someone who killed me getting a lesser sentence than someone who killed a police officer or paramedic. Equality under the law should also mean equality of victims. All lives matter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The grounds on which you can object to a development are already far more limited than many realise....until it affects them.

<|startoftext|>@EamonnCleary7 It certainly sounds American.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Emwold1 That's common everywhere. But I usually (wrongly) take it as a genuine enquiry and reply "Yes thank you". But nobody ever says "Hey!" to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People in #Corrie often begin conversations or greet people with "Hey!" Sometimes the other person says "Hey!" back. Is this now common in contemporary society? (Asking for a friend who doesn't get out much).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@matwatkinson To cut a boring story short I think a lady lost her wedding ring and then someone found it. The dreaded 'human interest' story.

<|startoftext|>@KenTayl09484158 @BBCr4today Are your tweets always that patronising?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>"Automatic planning permission", if as described, will drive a coach &amp; horses through Local Plans that seek to preserve the character of towns and villages &amp; protect the natural environment and is a further attack on democracy by Cummings and Johnson.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>One Saturday when my Dad was doing housework a neighbour came &amp; gave him a ticket for an Everton Cup Final. Whoosh, he was gone shouting "Tell your Mother I've gone to London".

<|startoftext|>@claireelizaw Thanks for that. I wasn't very confident about it but took a punt, especially as that particular meadow is full of Marbled White.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But later I did get a rather mediocre photo of a Marbled White. #NatureNotes  https://t.co/c4Scz4zQn8<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@debicing As I said in my tweet, the Co-op did it many years ago. I know it's nothing new, just hasn't been picked up by the media before.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I hear Tesco are going to sack their cleaners and have the cleaning of stores done by retail staff. My local Co-op did this years ago. "I hope you're paid extra for this" I said to one of them. "Don't be silly" was the reply. Isn't capitalism wonderful?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"All foreign agents will have to register." Is this a joke?  "Hello. Is that the Foreign Office? I'm Igor, a diplomat at the Russian Embassy. I'm actually a spy so could you send me one of your registration forms? Or can I register online?"<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@alfienoakes63 There's a story of Cilla in a Liverpool pantomime where she had a line that was something like "I'm going to do something that will terrify you". After she said it a small boy shouted "Oh Christ, she's going to sing!"<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ShelaghL01 @Flomoll The Speaker has no powers to stop politicians lying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martinjhamer But his powers are very limited, far more than those of a teacher. Bercow, for all his huffing and puffing, couldn't stop Johnson proroguing Parliament. It took the Supreme Court to do that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martinjhamer Many people seem to have exaggerated idea of the Speaker's powers. The anger I'm seeing against him is very unfair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neilmclaughlin2 @r1tch2e The Speaker is not appointed. He is elected by MPs many of whom often don't vote for someone from their own party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BFujer He told Johnson off at PMQs on Wednesday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@john1genius He has no powers to do anything about it. All he can do is express his displeasure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Johnson: the scientists give us advice but it's for elected politicians to make the policy. It's quite a shift from the earlier unqualified 'we're following the science'. #downingstreetbriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doubt the Speaker will be too pleased that yet again the Government is making major announcements to the media and on TV rather than to Parliament first. #downingstreetbriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Late to this but shocked when I listened properly to the Government's radio ad for Brexit: 'The UK's New Start'.

<|startoftext|>Edward Troup, formerly of Treasury and HMRC, says the advantage of VAT is that it affects everyone, implying it's a fair tax. But it's actually a regressive tax disproportionately affecting the poor which is probably why Tory Government's have always loved increasing it. #r4today<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@shawemily I wish Starmer had come back on that: "aware of" the report rather than saying he'd read it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think Johnson (who by the way after combing his hair after his haircut has gone back to the through-a-hedge-backwards look) is the first PM to be indignant not just at the content of the Opposition Leader's questions but at the very idea of being questioned at all. #PMQs<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You'd think if Tom Swarbrick was doing a phone-in on face masks he'd gen up on what the rules will be. But no. He thinks shop staff will also have to wear face masks. They won't. To be fair, Swarbrick used to be a No 10 advisor. #LBC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>"I'm not going to write our next manifesto now" from Labour frontbenchers is going to wear a bit thin over the next few years when they're not being asked to do that but simply to indicate some broad brush principles and policy positions. #Marr<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Whatever the merits of #eatouttohelpout I'm struck by the fact that a Government that had to be shamed by a young footballer into continuing food vouchers for disadvantaged children is now giving restaurant vouchers to everyone in the country. #BBCNews #PoliticsLive<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Government announced today it has no intention of ever again revealing the number of people tested each day. But #BBCNews at Six didn't think this worth mentioning in its Coronavirus report. That's how Govt can get away with it. @BBCHughPym @BBCNews<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Everyone was being sensible and social distancing in Andrew Marr's world. So that's all right then, we can all relax. But don't suppose Marr was part of the densely-packed throngs in Soho streets or in crowded pubs that police had to shut down in the Midlands. #Marr<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@daveRessex That's number of tests, not the number of people tested. They are two very different things.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hollyhock140 @BBCr4today Some truth in that. Local corruption feels more personal, especially if your application was refused and you see a local builder who is also a prominent Tory get permission for something. Even if latter is above aboard it raises suspicions.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wronghumans There's this but I think there must be even more detailed guidance sent to specific trade sectors which I haven't seen but which journalists are reporting on.  https://t.co/2y4xKwUSVB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now people have had time to pore over the detailed guidance for pubs it's clear that many drinkers will think it's just not worth all the hassle......unless of course the rules are widely ignored. (Remember the illegal lock-ins of the last century?). #5live<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>20% of UK adults are teetotal [ONS, 2017]. There must be many others who drink infrequently and rarely visit pubs. Yet from media reporting and from Johnson's witterings you'd think pubs were the focal point of everyone's lives and the most important thing to re-open.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matwatkinson I think the 'plus' in 'one metre plus' stands for 'mitigations'. The criminal fraternity will think that refers to the stuff their brief says when asking the judge for a non-custodial sentence.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BrianUkulele Your local scheme sounds brilliant. Took about 8 weeks for local Council to phone to see if I needed help with shopping. And Govt food parcels only began arriving after I no longer needed them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A lesson that must be learned for the next pandemic is that when shielding began it took several more weeks for the support services to kick in, such as food parcels, supermarket priority slots etc, so many shielded people had no choice but to go shopping at great risk. #C4News<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sturgess_steve There was no agreement. Oborne, rightly in my view, said he's racist. Dale insisted he isn't. Would be interesting to hear Dale, who is gay, also defend Johnson's homophobic comments. He's probably capable of doing so. #LBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two old Tory blokes, Peter Oborne and Iain Dale, had a right old ding-dong on #LBC about whether Boris Johnson is aracist or not. But it's not a difficult question. Why would any non-racist use the kind of racist language that Johnson has done?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@redflag3rd @LabourHulme Yes but nothing whatsoever to do with my tweet!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well done to #BBCNews at One for playing the Marcus Rashford interview. But why didn't they tell viewers that the Government today rejected his plea to extend the meal voucher scheme? @BBCNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redflag3rd @ChristoClifford Rubbish. Nothing to do with what I was saying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LabourHulme @redflag3rd Thanks for getting my point. There were also long queues today at more upmarket shops like Fenwicks in Newcastle but hey, let's all point at the stupid chavs queuing at Primark.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ItCorbyn These are all fair points but they have bugger all to do with the point I was making.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Department of Education has effectively told Marcus Rashford to sod off, reiterating that they won't extend the meal voucher scheme. Seems a strange battle for the Government to choose to fight. #BBCNews #LBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChristoClifford @redflag3rd Which has nothing to do with my point. That's a criticism of Primark. I was talking about those who sneer at people for shopping there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the first week of lockdown most local bus drivers were wearing face masks. Then as infection rates and deaths increased they all stopped wearing them. Today, because it's mandatory, they're all wearing them again. Almost nothing's made sense in the UK pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willshome Neither of those things are unique to Primark.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Primark seems to be the new C &amp; A which also used to be widely mocked. Why is retail snobbery acceptable?  People on low incomes need a source of inexpensive clothes. #LBC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I wonder how many consumers are sitting on a pile of cash because of all the money they've saved during lockdown, as Sunak claims? Those furloughed have had a 20% cut in their income. Those who fell through the gaps lost all income. #Marr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Talk about a Westminster/media bubble! Marr and the Sun's Jane Moore in agreement that people are enjoying a lovely, sunny 'fool's paradise' of picnics in the park during lockdown. Many are suffering in multiple ways, including being plunged into poverty. #Marr<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If the thinking behind the 'social bubble' was that it would fill the media with schmaltzy, sentimental photos and videos of families reuniting then that's one thing the Government got right.......unfortunately.

<|startoftext|>@Tudortweet One obstacle was Johnson's ideological nonsense: "the ancient, inalienable right of free-born people of the United Kingdom to go to the pub". Another was the view (wrong in my opinion) that people wouldn't tolerate lockdown unless it was very short.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On #LBC this morning the scientist in charge of the Oxford vaccine programme agreed with Prof Neil Ferguson that thousands of lives would have been saved if we'd locked down earlier. So Tories &amp; their media allies can't dismiss Ferguson as some kind of maverick.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Shapps just said to people in the South-West "Stay alert, stay at home."  Which is it? I thought "Stay Alert" had replaced "Stay at home". And if I stay at home I don't need to stay alert......except for the bullshit emanating from the #DailyBriefing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sharpeleven @bane_baldy @UKLabour It's very alarming because it suggests the Shadow Work &amp; Pensions Secretary doesn't understand the founding principles of our welfare system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yesterday the Government was trumpeting the 'low' weekday death figure of 176.  Today's figure is 357, as we pass the grim 40,000 deaths milestone. Number of people tested still "Unavailable" which is unacceptable. #DailyBriefing #BBCNews #LBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many of us were fearful Labour would go back to the days when Rachel Reeves was shadow welfare secretary. The support people receive should be based on need and nothing else.

<|startoftext|>We're in no position to be too critical of a lack of transparency by the Brazilian Government when our own is refusing to reveal how many people they're testing, fiddling the number of tests done and has withdrawn the international death comparison chart. #r4today #BBCNews<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Rees-Mogg in his patronising, elongated drawl is still defending the farcical shambles he created in the #Commons this week rather than continuing electronic voting. A toxic combination of stupidity and stubbornness from someone you wouldn't trust to organise the Eton tuck shop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"We have this world-beating service, which we will do..." says Brandon Lewis, changing from the present to the future tense in the same sentence as even his own bullshitting brain rebelled against the lie he was spouting about Test and Trace. #r4today<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sturgess_steve @BBCPolitics Rees-Mogg said in the Commons yesterday he'd once taken his sister Annunciata (or 'Stigmata' as John Crace brilliantly called her) to Alton Towers. I wondered if that was accidental and he thought it was a National Trust property.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Andrea Leadsom hasn't become any less stupid since we last saw her. MPs in other countries manage to vote electronically without their 6 year olds getting hold of their phone or tablet and casting a vote. #PoliticsLive @BBCPolitics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Electronic voting has been a permanent feature of the devolved Parliaments and most others around the world for many years. Our own Parliament should have abandoned their archaic voting system which wastes hundreds of hours a long time ago. #PoliticsLive @BBCPolitics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The root of the Rees-Mogg Conga Chaos is that his view of Parliament has merged with his fundamentalist Catholicism to produce a quasi-religious, mystical concept of Parliament that is as remote from reality as the doctrine of transubstantiation. #PoliticsLive @BBCPolitics<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Answer to the Scottish journalist is that the advice to shielded people is now different in England because in England the change was made entirely for cynical political reasons. #DailyBriefing #BBCNews #LBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hancock says they now have the capacity to do 206,444 tests per day. Don't know why but I'm intrigued by the last two digits. That 44 seems both bizarrely precise and random at the same time. #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nutteretc @sharpeleven Whatever they think they're doing I don't think cynical, too-clever-by-half, dancing on the head of a pin politics will play well with the public.

<|startoftext|>@Tudortweet It's availability that's the issue. We'd supposedly been planning for a pandemic for years but we still had a chronic shortage of PPE when it hit us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2..... (We are concerned here with breaches of the regulations, not the general Government guidance to ‚Äústay at home‚Äù.) #C4News<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haven't seen a single journalist accurately report Durham Police. Key bit is: 'does not consider that by locating himself at his father‚Äôs premises, Mr Cummings committed an offence contrary to regulation six of the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) Regulations 2020..'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dentists and dental nurses are going to need some heavy duty PPE given the aerosol spray their procedures can generate.  https://t.co/y9tjHccThI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Claudiachan00 @SpanishDan1 Totally agree. Imagine how we'd react to another national leader behaving in that way. #LBC's Ben Kentish just said he's never seen anything like it and couldn't believe his ears. #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealSueKelly Same with my neighbours. Has sometimes stopped me going in my own garden because I'm quite close to them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melb4886 I think we heard him trying to come back but he was cut off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blimey, even The Sun getting the boot in: "Would you encourage people to go on a 60 mile round trip to test their eyesight?". #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Laura's not a happy woman. "Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned...." üòÑ #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Many didn't understand the rules going into lockdown (especially re over-70s) but as we come out of lockdown the rules are becoming even more complicated which could be a recipe for disaster. #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reporting of the number of people tested (as opposed to the number of tests done) is still "temporarily paused to ensure consistent reporting across all pillars." Yeah, right. They must think we've just come down the Manchester Ship Canal on a doily. #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Important to point out that Durham Police said they were not commenting on whether Cummings went against Government guidance in going to Durham, they were only ruling on whether he breached a specific Public Health Regulation. #LBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jeremy Hunt: "The big picture here is that today the government has launched a system which is international best practice, it is what has been proven to work all over the world." With whoppers like that he must surely have guaranteed a future peerage. #wato<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Full Durham Police statement is now on Guardian Politics Blog.  https://t.co/ujAocNx6ev<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ItCorbyn From what I've seen so far, given that Telegraph is behind a paywall, Durham Police have said the Barnard Castle trip was a minor breach but not the longer trip from London to Durham which seems a bit odd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricDun75754404 It wasn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For clarification, not Cummings. "The fines were issued on 8 April against two people from different households who travelled together from London to Peterlee, in County Durham."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Best4Eu No it wasn't Cummings, it was two other people. Perhaps I should have made that clear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I called out this long-time follower for using a homophobic term and this was his reply. How charming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mr_LukeHarrison @heather_c_c So saying Cummings has to go is a "distraction from the Cummings has to go message. Failure of logic there I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Durham police today said that they fined two people for travelling hundreds of miles from London to their area during the coronavirus lockdown." - via Guardian.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@holenewman You're a disgrace too for using a homophobic insult.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ben Bradshaw in defence of Starmer not calling for Cummings to be sacked says "There's no point in calling for something that you don't have the power to make happen." FFS! That would mean an Opposition remaining silent on nearly everything! #TrappistPolitics #SkyNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SkyNews has just replayed the clip of Matt Hancock's interview with Kay Burley. Never mind him laughing, which I'd heard about. He seemed completely unhinged! üò≤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The failure of the track and trace IT on its first day has now been declared a "critical incident", #LBC reports.  A national critical incident should have been declared on 24th July 2019, the day Boris Johnson became Prime Minister.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neil_andy @hawkins_carole @mellors_karen Yes, it's clear that it was rushed out before it was ready to divert from Cummings. Contact tracers say they were told it was going live this morning only at 10.30 last night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>30 minutes in and the contact tracing IT system has already crashed. Of course it has. #r4today #LBC #5live #BBCNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sturgess_steve I don't see how 25,000 could have gone through vetting in such a short time. Many say they haven't had adequate training. Do they have access to your address as well as your phone number? Can they access the police national computer? Lots of unknowns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hancock has told #LBC contact tracers will call from the number 03000135000. How many people would answer that number unless they already knew it was an official NHS number? I'm damn sure I wouldn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As Robinson asks a final question about Cummings we hear Matt Hancock laughing in the background. 60,000 dead but it's all just a game to these bastards. #r4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the same sentence Matt Hancock called it a 'request' to isolate and an 'instruction'. It's either one or t'other. #r4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the face of it, scope for mischievous or malicious forcing of someone into 14 days isolation. #r4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People who were angry when Maitlis did hatchet jobs on Corbyn are now defending her for doing a hatchet job on Cummings, simply because the latter aligned with their own opinion. She and her colleagues shouldn't be doing hatchet jobs on anyone. Too many opinionated prima donnas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a very good point given how wary people are now about calls from people they don't know and many have call blocking measures on their landlines.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every injunction spewing from the mouths of Hancock and Harding - "do the right thing" etc - rings very hollow in the light of Cummings' behaviour. It will be dangerous and regrettable but understandable if some people's response is "Oh, fuck off!" #DailyBriefing #TestAndTrace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good old Laura, true to form. Saying 'Prime Ministers' in the plural to try to deflect from what was a uniquely Johnson car crash. #LiaisonCommittee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's often forgotten that we did do quarantining at the very beginning. We all saw the busloads of people being taken to the Wirral for 14 days. But then as the pandemic escalated we dropped it and let people fly in unrestricted. #LiaisonCommittee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"OK, Rob, you're piling on some questions here......" says the floundering fool, fiddling with his notes, panic in his eyes. Now he's having a May-style coughing attack.  You'd almost feel sorry for him if if this wasn't the job he'd craved all his life. #LiaisonCommittee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lots of name checks for Dido from Johnson. TalkTalk customers love Dido Harding. It was on her watch that our personal data was hacked making us a target for criminal scammers. #LiaisonCommittee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Johnson smirks as he says he can't say when there will be a 24 hour turnaround for tests, then says he's been told not to give any more such dates. Who told him that? Someone called Cummings by any chance? #LiaisonCommittee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice lady caller to #LBC says "Boris has betrayed us". If only there'd been things in his past life that might have warned us how he'd behave. ü§î<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When a Government becomes an international laughing stock it seldom ends well for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MartinF77174076 It also has to be put in the context of the international comparison chart disappearing from the #DailyBriefing once we had the highest death toll in Europe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funny that I had noticed it and been tweeting about it but No 10 hadn't! They think we've all just fallen off the Christmas tree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the #BBCNews report on the Government's Track, Test &amp; Trace programme there wasn't one mention of the word 'app'. Has technology been abandoned now? We'll see what IT whizz kid little Matt Hancock says later. @BBCNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melb4886 That's at the Liaison Committee at 4pm. Entirely different thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Robert Jenrick says it's fine for others to do what Cummings did. I'm not an epidemiologist but if one person has Coronavirus symptoms isn't putting the rest of the family in a car with them for a few hours a sure way to give it to everyone else?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soxgnasher @garyfoskett Sir Bernard Jenkin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I kid you not, some of those ignoring my request not to @ me in defence of Labour not calling for Cummings to go are saying this is 'not a political issue'. üò≤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlvinFord14 I know that. The question is why Twitter is fact checking other people's tweets but putting out false information itself. This appears in Twitter's 'What's Happening' sidebar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is Twitter telling us there's a Prime Minister's Questions today? The Commons is in recess until next Tuesday. #PMQs #FakeNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickyAACampbell You're asking people criticising Cummings which way they vote but not those defending him. Why is that? #5live #YourCall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We haven't heard anything recently about that wonderful tracing app that was being trialled on the Isle of Wight. It used to be all over the news. Saw something anecdotal on Twitter that it's been left to wither on the vine but don't know if that's true. #r4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lisa Nandy who was happy to say her own previous party leader should resign cannot bring herself to say unequivocally that Cummings should resign or be sacked. #r4today  (Please don't bother to @ me to defend Starmer's new milksop Labour.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matwatkinson I was astonished at how much detail he came out with. At the time much of it seemed irrelevant until, as you say, you realised it contradicted the account of his dear old missus. Hoist with his own petard of arrogance and conceit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StelucBrooks @martinjhamer Apology accepted. If it's an eyesight problem you could check it out by driving to Barnard Castle. üòÑ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This reminds me of how Harold Shipman got caught out by technology. Police found he'd retrospectively changed his victims' medical notes to say they had a heart condition after he'd murdered them. Shipman also thought he was very clever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@j_sutherland2 Hope Starmer got the approval of the Board of Deputies before appointing him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StelucBrooks @martinjhamer I was pointing out the error, not making it. So don't call me a dimwit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martinjhamer Twitter seems to have confused #Peston with Robert Preston  who was a character in #Corrie. I think Tracy's florist is still called Preston's Petals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hancock not allowing any follow-ups today, other than for Kuenssberg. Peston asked a really stupid question but that won't surprise anyone familiar with him. #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mcardle_bob @FannyJan123 @BBCNews Often they lie but some of them are so thick they'd struggle to understand the rules of Pointless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@barspence7 @gletherby @DessieMByrne @UKLabour Far from uniting against it being politicised a lot of Tories are currently uniting against Cummings, including their own Scottish Leader.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mcardle_bob @FannyJan123 @BBCNews That's what I'm doing. Calling them out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notfittoserve @esme_hornbeam The letter arose from a joint meeting of opposition party leaders this morning which Labour refused to join.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Lucibee @Peston @bbclaurak @itvnews @Channel4News They managed to do it for many weeks. What's changed? Or is it the same glitch that has stopped them publishing the international comparison chart?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gletherby @DessieMByrne Absolutely 2. On a day the the Tory Leader in Scotland calls on Cummings to go Labour can't even be arsed to sign a letter with the other opposition parties. I'm livid. @UKLabour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Lucibee @Peston @bbclaurak @itvnews @Channel4News Could well be. It's similar to them stopping showing the international comparison chart for deaths. They shouldn't be allowed to get away with it but they probably will.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet more 'forensic', 'long game', 'don't interrupt your enemy' bollocks from Starmer's Labour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For the second day running the Dept of Health has given the number of tests done but not the number of people tested. Previously they always gave the latter figure which was much lower than tests done. A question for the #DailyBriefing? @Peston @bbclaurak @itvnews @Channel4News<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CocoonedPenguin @robertcourts I might have misheard. He may have said 'barista'. üòÑ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CocoonedPenguin @robertcourts Even worse, he said at the end "I'm a barrister".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markfrank60 As someone with bad teeth, what's left of them, I live in fear of something similar happening to me. I believe there are 'dentistry hubs' but it's said that being in agony doesn't always qualify you to visit one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Worrying that some Tory MPs like Robert Courts now on #BBCNews don't understand Government rules. At the time Cummings went to Barnard Castle you were NOT allowed to make a 30 minute car journey to take a 15 minute walk. @BBCNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackBob1952 I should have mentioned the figure: 59%. What a master tactician Cummings is!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martinjhamer Mine should be illegal but it isn't because I cut it myself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I said yesterday it was strange he was able to rise from his sick bed and drive 5 miles to the hospital to collect his wife and son.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>According to YouGov the percentage of people who think Cummings should resign has increased since his press conference yesterday. So that worked well. üòÉ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sturgess_steve @piersmorgan Odd that none of them asked him that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This #BBCNews report on rogue barbers offering illegal haircuts is pure The Day Today. It reminds me of that programme's backstreet dentists piece. Come to think it of it, maybe there's secret dentistry going on during lockdown. üòÑ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@georgina09641 @piersmorgan Surely not! üòÑ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimpliArt @piersmorgan @susannareid100 @Kevin_Maguire @campbellclaret @0Calamity @Ajaywillow1 @carolJhedges Interesting thing about that clip is how Ferrari immediately turned it into a joke and they both had a good laugh about it. With a Labour Minister Ferrari would have immediately gone into Rottweiler mode.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We still haven't heard why Cummings' wife couldn't drive them home. From an article she once wrote in the Spectator (tweeted by @piersmorgan) we now know she can drive. #BBCNews #LBC #SkyNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Very clever" Dom caught out lying by pesky internet archiving.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"UK Covid-19 death toll passes 47,000, data reveals".  I could swear I heard Boris Johnson last night listing all the ways the Government's handling of the pandemic had been a huge success. #BBCNews #LBC #SkyNews #StayElite<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least this has destroyed the claim that Cummings is 'very clever': 1. Putting himself &amp; child in a car for 5 hours with a wife he thought had Coronavirus. 2. Driving round trip of 60 miles with wife &amp; child to test his eyesight. Closer to Frank Spencer than Einstein. #r4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JudgeDewie @jennylandreth She's a woman and she's ludicrous. I didn't say she's ludicrous because she's a woman or that all women are ludicrous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bizarre criticism of Bishop of Worcester by Webb. Few people use 'Mr' on Twitter because of the limited characters.  I have some spare here but I'm not going back to insert 'Mr' in front of 'Webb'. Might change it to 'that twat Webb'. #r4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Number of tests done yesterday: 73,726, well below the target of 100,000. Number of people tested: Government website says "Unavailable". #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theginny Or that Cummings rose from his sickbed to drive to the hospital to collect mother and child.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cummings complained about his home being under siege and being shown on TV. Corbyn had to endure that at his home for four years and almost certainly had more death threats than Cummings. (Btw, Bishop of Worcester had a death threat today for criticising Cummings). #BBCNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is absolute bullshit from Cummings. None of the communications I've received from the Government mentioned anything about being able to use your own judgement. #BBCNews #LBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cummings' little boy must have an unusually strong bladder if they were able to drive from London to Durham without a single stop. They had to stop for him to have a pee on their short trip to Barnard Castle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This could have been a lot shorter if Cummings had just lip-synced to Piaf's Je ne regrette rien for 3 minutes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matwatkinson Oh he's certainly that. As the psychiatrist guest said of Basil Fawlty 'there's enough material there for an entire conference.'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People have drawn attention to the code of conduct for special advisers which says they "must not take public part in political controversy, through any form of statement whether in speeches or letters...." But of course normal rules don't apply to Dominic Cummings. #LBC #BBCNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One question I'd like Dominic Cummings to be asked later is why his wife wrote a detailed account of his illness for the Spectator (and broadcast on #r4today) without mentioning the trip to Durham and giving the clear impression they'd stayed in London. #LBC #BBCNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Weston Super Mare hospital has temporarily stopped accepting new patients due to a ‚Äúhigh number of patients with coronavirus in the hospital‚Äù.  Hope that is not related to the town being a seaside resort.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a pathetic wimp Justin Webb is, letting Gavin Williamson walk all over him by obfuscation and changing the subject. But quite possibly Webb had no wish to hold him to account anyway. #r4today @BBCr4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This Labour Junior Shadow Minister Steve Reed lost me when he said we don't know whether Cummings travelled north by train or by car. I thought it was beyond dispute he went by car. #r4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm amazed that @Guardian still hasn't found a way of stopping those fake @MartinSLewis ads appearing on its website. One on their Home page today. @KathViner<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Evilgenius222 @BBCr4today So far no. But there's two hours left for them to get a toady MP on for balance. Which is fair enough because anyone who does that is destroying their own reputation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ludicrous front page piece in the Telegraph by that ludicrous woman Camilla Tominey saying that Boris Johnson is a sensitive soul who can't bear to let people go. The long trail of abandoned wives, girlfriends and unknown children might take a different view. #BBCNews #r4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sharpeleven He's a lawyer. Inquiries, especially the big, multi-million pound public ones, are very lucrative for lawyers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eralcbear @BorisJohnson He also didn't realise he was meant to read out the second public question that wasn't on video. But that's the kind of thing that made him so lovable.......to people with part of their brain missing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LexDavies3 Life is full of surprises.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#skynews has reported this. I doubt #BBCNews will.  https://t.co/eVsBgx5mgi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulrcalexander @sturgess_steve @GSBOutNow Even if it was outside the isolation period it was at a time in the lockdown when driving 30 miles to go for a walk was not allowed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These are horribly disorientating times. I find myself agreeing with Peter Bone. I find myself retweeting Piers Morgan - he's even retweeted me. All a consequence of having the worst Prime Minister of my lifetime.....quite possible the worst of all time. #C4News #DailyBriefings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#skynews say they can confirm that the car number plate that a witness saw in Barnard Castle at the time he saw Cummings there matches that of a car used by Dominic Cummings. The Barnard Castle visit has never specifically been denied. #DailyBriefings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I suppose we shouldn't be too surprised by what we've just seen given that Johnson illegally shut down Parliament when it got in his way and threw out of the Tory party a load of long-serving MPs like Ken Clarke. #DailyBriefings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LexDavies3 Spot on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What makes this even more insulting to the public is that Johnson is refusing to answer any specific questions about Cummings' behaviour. #DailyBriefing #borisspeech #BBCNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The logic of this (which people keep saying to me) is that Labour shouldn't criticise the Government for anything because nearly everything they've done in this crisis has been a massive fucking mistake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michielhoefsmit @CymraegChris On his Facebook page he said the tweet was a mistake and he should not have said it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tory MP Robert Halfon has withdrawn his tweet in support of Cummings, saying he'd done it "because I thought at the time that both parents had been ill with coronavirus, genuinely had no one to look after the infant...". You'd hope MPs would check the facts before sounding off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's very odd how often on TV news clips Cummings appears to emerge from the basement of his home and is frequently clutching a black bin bag, looking like a serial killer setting off to dispose of body parts. #BBCNews #SkyNews #LBC #DurhamDom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Ridge #Marr #LBC #DurhamDom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At 10.12 it's become four Tory MPs. Latest is Roger Gale. #Marr #Ridge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DylanStrain 'Clever long game' seems to be the new 'forensic'. üòÑ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now Tory MP Damian Collins, Chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, has joined Steve Baker in calling for Cummings to go. #Ridge #Marr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So #Ridge giving advance notice of questions that Shapps would be asked didn't work. He just says: 'Dunno, nothing to do with me guv, I'm the Transport Secretary.'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh dear, I've upset the Starmer fan club with my criticism of the Labour response over Cummings. It's almost like it's a cult.  (Sorry. Couldn't resist it.üòÑ)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fanxxxxtastic The irony is that these are the people who used to accuse Corbyn of weak leadership.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fenladybiker This morning we've had a right-wing Brexiter Tory MP Steve Baker calling for Cummings to go and a Labour Shadow Minister refusing to do so. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è#Ridge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour Shadow Police Minister Sarah Jones is asked if Cummings should resign or be sacked. Her reply: 'there are questions to be answered'. This is what Labour has been reduced to under Starmer. Weak, weak, weak. #Ridge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackBob1952 I think he had a pretty clear idea what he was going to say. By improv I meant inviting the audience to suggest topics, names etc. There's a dreadful R4 series that does that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aggiegoatmother @CyrusPeroz Oh I don't know......üï∫<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a reason most comedy is scripted. It's because improv comedy is shit. #BritainsGotTalent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cowling_keith I'm always impressed how many of my followers have a good knowledge of Coward.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jazzgetsdeeper They did, and what's the betting Ridge and Marr will ask the same stupid question tomorrow morning?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cathy Newman, like all the other fuckwit journos, thinks "What would you have done?" is a sensible question to ask Cummings' critics. There must be many thousands of families who've been in a similar position and coped without driving 250 miles. #C4News<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tory MP Sir Charles Walker deplores the hounding of people who break lockdown rules. But his party has been hounding the poor, the sick and disabled for ten years with vicious policies, driving many to suicide. But apparently we must stop being beastly to Cummings. #C4News<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So this child we're now told was 'vulnerable' was being allowed to play doctor with his father who was so seriously ill with the virus that Mrs Cummings had to keep checking he was still breathing. None of it makes any sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@garyk01 @readerbythesea They are part of his family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pleased to see @UKLabour have toughened up their position and are asking why No 10 are contradicting what Durham Police said. No word yet from the Labour Leader though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No 10 has just said at no time were Cummings or his family spoken to by the police. Durham police said they did speak to them. Someone is lying. #resign #dominicgoings #LBC #BBCNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheFabledAesop @allanfisher01 'Oh what a tangled web....." etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matwatkinson One of my followers who works on a Covid ward pointed that out to me at the time Johnson said it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tudortweet @BBCr4today The lead was the Huawei story which they then moved over to a right hand column in the 2nd edition. You're right, this is all a bit nerdy. üòÑ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sturgess_steve @shuftiscope @BBCNews @BBCPolitics @bbclaurak Former No 10 SPAD under May Tom Swarbrick has said Cummings will have to go. But Dan Hodges, having spotted an opportunity for self-promotion and that broadcasters will want a balancing view, has been on #LBC defending him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tudortweet @BBCr4today They changed their front page for the 2nd edition after the Mirror &amp; Guardian broke the story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sturgess_steve @shuftiscope @BBCNews @BBCPolitics More likely hadn't had time to cook it up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilPaxman @ItCorbyn @BBCNaga @BBCBreakfast I've done that car journey from southern England to the north-east several times and always had to stop for petrol and/or toilet breaks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shuftiscope @BBCNews @BBCPolitics The bit about Cummings' sister is a new element introduced by Kuenssberg. Odd that her source didn't mention that to her last night. #r4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The final paper review on #r4today at 08.50 ignored the Cummings story completely, so if you'd just woken up and switched on you wouldn't know it was the front page lead in three papers. @BBCr4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redhead_matthew @hughbarnard Fair point although there's the medical principle of patient confidentiality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If, as Mishal Husain said, Cummings on arrival in Durham "collapsed and became seriously ill" it seems odd that he wasn't taken to hospital or at least visited by paramedics. #r4today<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The NHS surcharge shouldn't apply to refuse collectors, shop workers, delivery drivers or any migrant workers whatsoever. Many are low paid and all are paying taxes. That should be @UKLabour policy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Kearney failed to point out to Brokenshire that the exemption from the #NHS surcharge for migrant doctors and nurses that he kept mentioning is only a temporary one. #r4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At #PMQs yesterday Boris Johnson said he'd thought long and hard about whether migrant workers in the #NHS should have to pay hundreds or even thousands of pounds to use the #NHS themselves &amp; decided it was the right policy.

<|startoftext|>I've now found this at the Guardian: "Statistics on the Department of Health and Social Care‚Äôs website show that although there were 177,216 tests, only 60,744 individuals actually got tested during this 24-hour period." #DailyBriefing #PMQs #C4News #BBCNews<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>How did number of tests done increase by 87,432 since the day before? And why (so far as I can discover) has the Government stopped revealing the number of people tested each day? Is it because @piersmorgan kept drawing attention to that figure? #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chinless wonder Oliver Dowden so disliked the question from #LBC about bereaved families of cleaners &amp;  porters being denied indefinite leave to remain that he announced in advance that, unlike all the other journalists, he wouldn't allow him a follow-up. #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@faybijou Some people are tested more than once. There's also suspicion that postal tests are double counted. Hancock denied the latter claim in the Commons today - for what that's worth.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Good questions from Starmer. However when Johnson lied about his Government's original advice on care homes Starmer's reply that he was "surprised that Johnson queries his own government‚Äôs advice" was far too mild. A missed chance to twist the knife. #PMQs<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Prof Stephen Powis is another one who is a disgrace to his profession. The 'worst case scenario' death figure in the original modelling is a red herring.

<|startoftext|>Politicians are notorious for not answering questions but Alok Sharma has turned it into a piece of performance art. #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In interviews today Hancock got away with saying we were now hitting 100,000 tests a day. Today's test figure: 85,293. Number of people tested: 60,410. Latest daily deaths figure: 627.

<|startoftext|>@Teresa_Peckham @piersmorgan We've all worked with people like that. It comes from the insecurity of knowing you're not really up to it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jstockbridge1 @piersmorgan So has Martha herself. üò¥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably just as well Matt Hancock didn't go on #GMB. He managed to get a bit tetchy even with narcoleptic Martha Kearney on #r4today. Confronted by @piersmorgan he'd probably have had a full meltdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hancock keeps saying all the changes are fine if we keep to social distancing. Yet they've watered down the advice to keeping 2 metres apart, *if possible*. #r4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I earlier wrote an almost identical tweet to this but then deleted it without posting because I decided I might have misheard Johnson. The increasing gibberish he spouts means I now don't trust my own ears.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Metro, owned by the Daily Mail Group, is really sticking the knife into Johnson and his Government at the moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>None of the public (who I think were pre-recorded anyway) got follow-up questions, unlike the media. Can't have the hoi polloi getting above themselves and not accepting the wisdom dispensed by their masters. #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On BBC1 they think it's more important for us to hear Kuenssberg than the rest of the #DailyBriefing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@anninbarry I was about to say that. Labour and Tories in perfect harmony on #r4today, both refusing to say workers should refuse to work in unsafe conditions. Starmer's brave new Labour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed. One of them explicitly said if people had any concerns they should stay home. #r4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see @piersmorgan is back at work, having a warm-up with little Andrew Bridgen. But making Andrew Bridgen look an idiot is like shooting dead fish in a barrel. (I wonder if Bridgen still thinks all English people have a right to an Irish passport?). #GMB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Appalling interview by Labour's Nick Thomas-Symonds. For God's sake man, just answer the question and say if working conditions are unsafe people should walk out, as is their legal right. #r4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is an enigmatic entry on tomorrow's Commons Order Paper: 'Personal Statement Details to follow'. My only guess is that it could be from Conor Burns who recently resigned from the Government after being found to have intimidated a member of the public.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the vague and puzzling things in the speech was that from this week "you can drive to other destinations". He didn't say how far or for what purpose. To exercise? For a day trip? From London to Cumbria? #BorisSpeech #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guardian: "France to be exempt from UK quarantine rules, Johnson and Macron agree". Will he agree a similar exemption with his soulmate Trump? How many exemptions will it take for a quarantine policy to be worthless? #BorisJohnson #BorisSpeech<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rupertsmum It's possible Carrie could confirm that. Remember the police being called to their house?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wish they'd handcuffed Johnson's arms to his chair. I'm constantly distracted by his stubby little fingers and the way he sometimes throws a clenched fist towards the camera. And when he said 'second peak' he gave a thumbs up. Weird body language. #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#StayAlert #BorisHasFailed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In rejigging their BBC1 schedule to accommodate Boris Johnson tonight the BBC has axed a programme about the communication skills of chimpanzees. There's got to be a joke in there somewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If #StayAlert means "obey the rules" then why not make "Obey The Rules" the actual slogan which would at least have the benefit of being precise and unambiguous? Or is that too clever for not-so-clever Tory MPs?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the one hand the Government say they want all the nations to move forward together. On the other, we learn they didn't consult the devolved administrations on changing and watering down the slogan. #StayAlert #ClownShow ü§°<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smoksie When I keep a distance from people it's not because I'm scared of THEM. It's to avoid catching the virus from them or, equally important, avoid me inadvertently passing it to them.

<|startoftext|>I think that was the episode of #DadsArmy that had to be hastily re-written because Arthur Lowe refused to have a grenade put down his trousers. A pity because it would have been more dramatic if Wilson had saved Mainwaring's life rather than Jones's.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just saw a BBC reporter reach over and touch a bench as he said the words 'street furniture'. That particular foible of TV reporters always makes me laugh. My favourite was a man who scooped up a handful of water from a pool as he said the word 'water'. #BBCNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@conalabu That's a myth. It may have happened in a few cases but it wasn't widespread.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We'll see how much working with Tory newspapers helps Labour at the next election. My guess is not very much. Gordon Brown became such good friends with Mail Editor Paul Dacre that he even invited Dacre to his daughter's funeral. Helped him not a jot. #C4News<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katieRead5 She has a strange, stilted delivery, like a sixth-former who's been made to do a reading at the school assembly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We live in strange times. At any other time in my life the Prime Minister's sister having her own radio show and having to discuss her brother's policies with political reporters would have been thought bizarre in the extreme. Not that it would ever have happened. #LBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fenladybiker Thus far it hasn't affected my supermarket status. We're told we can also refuse the food parcel delivery by telling the driver but in my case they either ring my bell and run or refuse to take it back. On the plus side it's a bonanza for foodbanks who are getting unwanted food.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fenladybiker That's the theory. It hasn't worked for me and one of my followers said the same. And I was told by Brakes delivery man if I changed my answer on the Govt website I'd lose my supermarket priority status and he wouldn't let me refuse the parcel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>George Eustice talked about the number of emergency food packages distributed to 'shielded' people. Hope someone raises the difficulty, if not impossibility, of stopping those deliveries by those not needing them, but doubt anyone will. That's the real world. #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>626 more deaths. 4,639 new cases identified. Still worryingly high figures which make talk of relaxing lockdown rules seem foolish. #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Lazarusfabulous @Cat_n_Bagpipes In 1941 Churchill was being heavily criticised and had Tory appeasers against him.

<|startoftext|>No good Raab blaming the press. However exaggerated, today's front pages didn't come out of nowhere.

<|startoftext|>@am1874northwich That's why the public debate of #IndependentSAGE this week was so refreshing and valuable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hunt: "The genius of British science is that we allow challenge". That applies to science globally. That's what peer review is all about. Moron. #BritishExceptionalism #C4News<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've always thought Hancock gives an impression of barely suppressed rage even when he's being polite. Today people saw the mask slip just a little. Hate to think what's he's like in private.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Independent scientists like Anthony Costello (unlike those employed by the Government) were predicting weeks ago that we would have the highest number of deaths in Europe. I admit I thought that was unduly alarmist at the time, but they were right. #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Angela McLean, the Deputy Chief Scientific Adviser, was about to say about the global deaths chart that our deaths were the highest in Europe then stopped, paused, and instead said "higher than we would wish.....that's all I can say." #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elsdraeger Of course not. Raab also gave a figure of 29,000 rather than the ONS figure of 32,000.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>84,000 tests done yesterday. Will we ever get back to that incredible* figure of 122,000 announced on Friday?  *literally incredible, as in not believable. #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't know why but phrases like "staggering train journeys" and "being spaced out on public transport" always remind me of my life when I was in my Twenties.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BBCNews just reported the fall in car sales in more horrified tones than they did the Coronavirus death toll rising to 32,000 and the worst in Europe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hancock tells #Commons it's been a success because the curve was flattened and the #NHS wasn't overwhelmed.  Shame about the 32,000 deaths, he didn't add. #BBCNews #LBC #itvnews #skynews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gildy61 They do. Yet they're the party that claims to love and respect  traditions and constitutional conventions. Only when it suits them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Speaker tells the Government it's unacceptable for the Government to make a major announcement on lockdown on Sunday. Such statements should always be made to Parliament first. Hancock doesn't respond that. #Commons<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hancock has just repeated in the Commons that the current test capacity is 108,000 a day. Will any MP be sufficiently on top of things to ask him how he managed to announce 122,000 tests last Friday? #Commons #HealthQuestions #BBCNews @BBCHughPym<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The current Guardian headline is "UK coronavirus death toll rises above 32,000 to highest in Europe." Those words never appeared on the midday #BBCNews but they led with Jennie Harries' attempt to rubbish any international comparisons at today's Health Committee.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryOpinionated Another one that didn't cause even a ripple was when Phillip Hammond went on Today and got the cost of HS2 wrong by ¬£20 Billion. To be fair, he was only the Chancellor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jennie Harries also said we shouldn't just look at the number of deaths. I suspect she'd rather we didn't look at that appalling figure at all. She's a disgrace to her profession.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Latest ONS figures, which include all mentions of Covid-19 on a death certificate, show we're now at almost 30,000 deaths. Actually we're already over that because their figures are up to 24th April. But no doubt today's #DailyBriefing will portray it all as a great success. #ONS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sturgess_steve But like many polls it showed people holding two contradictory views simultaneously. Sometimes that contradiction is a result of how you frame the questions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Matt Hancock is on #r4today. Justin Webb has a chance to ask him about this.  I'm on the edge of my seat. The tension is unbearable. @BBCr4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Hear, hear!" and "About time someone said that!" are just some of the things I wanted to be able to say but couldn't during the Keir Starmer interview. Ten minutes later I couldn't tell you anything of significance that he said. #r4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BEzzer3 Haven't seen it mentioned on any news programmes tonight either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#LBC's Eddie Mair and Ben Kentish picked up on that glaring discrepancy on tests that I mentioned. Yet not one of the 'journalists' at the #DailyBriefing challenged Matt Hancock on it. Are they afraid that Cummings will blacklist them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@weare126 That's what we were told. But it now seems testing is 'ramping down'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've noticed that the scientists always make a point of rubbishing the global deaths comparison chart while the other charts more favourable to the Government are to be taken at face value and completely accurate. #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matwatkinson @BBCNews That the number of tests has fallen so much since Friday just proves that the Friday figure was artificially inflated, in part by counting tests posted out but not returned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Older people are the least likely to have a smart phone. But the Isle of Wight where the contact tracing app is being trialled has an above average number of over-65s - 27.3% of the population, 17th highest nationally out of 381 local councils in England &amp; Wales. #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Matt Hancock just said the total testing capacity now stands at 108,000. Yet on Friday he announced that 122,347 tests had been done. That makes no sense unless Friday's figure for tests done was a lie or the testing capacity has fallen since Friday. #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#IndependentSAGE has been excellent. Many interesting points made that haven't been discussed elsewhere. My only regret is that I didn't make notes but I've never made notes at lectures or meetings. That it was free-flowing rather than tightly structured probably an advantage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tommousk I forgot to say the title of the BBC programme is 'Our Finest Hours' which implies the current shitshow is one of our finest hours. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StayWellNFire No, it wasn't a joke. They really have put it in the Gaming category.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrBob317 I wouldn't have known that because I've never done gaming. It's a closed book to me and one I'm unlikely ever to open. üòÑ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Outstanding contribution to @IndependentSage by Prof Allyson Pollock. Hope someone has clipped it for wider dissemination.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm watching the Independent Sage group on YouTube. But don't know why YouTube has put it in the category of 'Gaming'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@albatroos8 Understatement is my middle name. üòÑ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BBC1 is running a morning series all this week that looks at parallels between the war and our response to the pandemic - an absurd comparison in my view. Sometimes it feels like there's a kind of grooming of the public going on, by both Government and media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StewartDunb I'm sorry to hear of your problems but I'm in no position to help. I hope things get resolved soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TroutODoubt The advice on the Govt website is clear enough, the media reporting of it often less so. But I think a full lockdown like other countries had would have avoided all the ambiguities and confusion.  https://t.co/3FHSoh8ryl<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@spiralunbound @Tibbmum Worth remembering it was our own farming practices that caused BSE in cattle and Salmonella in eggs so we're not squeaky clean ourselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tibbmum From what I heard on World Service 'wet markets' and 'illegal markets' are two different things and it's the latter that were the problem and China claims to be cracking down on those.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paul_astell There are grey areas. COPD doesn't qualify you as 'very high risk' but 'severe COPD' does. But that's a matter of judgement by the GP, unless there's a precise definition of 'severe' somewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StewartDunb I'm sure there are many regional variations in provision. I'm now getting priority deliveries from two supermarkets and have also had an unrequested Govt food parcel and a call from the Council. But early in lockdown none of this was in place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lots of fake news about over-70s not allowed to leave home. Advice is they can go shopping &amp; go to pharmacy if not in extremely vulnerable group. Real scandal is that many of us in latter group had no option but to go shopping for weeks until alternatives were in place. #r4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Robinson really pushing the anti-China agenda. "Are you going to stand up to them?" [China] he asks Security Minister Ben Wallace. Little right-wing creeps like Robinson are always keen to stir up global conflicts. #r4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarziaNicodemiE @doctorshaib And that will include many who most need protection.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itiddly Too true. Surprising any of us can eat after looking at Gove for 45 minutes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a reward for watching the #DailyBriefing and tweeting about it I'm going to treat myself to a sausage sandwich. ü§§üòä<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Soc_Sciences Only if anyone other than me noticed it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On Trevor Phillips Gove does the old "I'm not aware of those comments." He was just made aware of those comments! #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oops! Stephen Powis, the Medical Director for NHS England, accidentally said: "We were looking at other health systems around the world that had been overwhelmed and we had not put in place social distancing measures........." Exactly! We were too slow. #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Re this magical new App: public spirited though I am, I think Paul Bernal makes a valid point. #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I reckon the tactic is for Ministers like Gove to drone on and bore people so much that they change channels before the press questions. #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's #DailyBriefing is running very late. Should have started at 4pm. Hope Gove who is leading it hasn't been on the marching powder again.  https://t.co/hYQIQmlXhw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrandexeJohn Apparently Johnson said he now has a mission to prevent others suffering. But that would mean he'd have to resign from the Tory Party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DalbidEU When his team at No 10 were considering the benefits to them of giving such an interview to The Sun I don't suppose they considered that talking about himself in that way might be a bit distasteful given that 28,000+ people had actually died.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see Culture Secretary Olive Dowden has made a formal complaint to the BBC DG over the #Panorama programme. It's a novel idea that you have to check which party someone supports before you interview them or only interview the politically neutral.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shapps previously tried the 'excess deaths are the important metric' argument on #Ridge but then she showed him a chart of UK excess deaths which appeared to contradict his claims. #Marr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was never Government policy that all over-70s couldn't leave the house, only those with serious underlying conditions - as was pointed out earlier in the programme. #Marr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matwatkinson @martinjhamer @91f0ae259086481 BBC can't even get the most simple facts straight. As I pointed out the other day they were saying over-65s without symptoms could get tested which wasn't true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hugh Pym must surely know that one reason the Nightingale hospitals weren't needed is that the very elderly were left to die in huge numbers in care homes and in their own homes. #Marr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was the most offensive thing in Johnson's interview: the attempt to attribute his recovery to his own personal qualities. #Ridge #Marr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, I'd have thought the arrangements for the announcement of a PM's death would be made by No 10, not by hospital doctors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't imagine why so many are suggesting the account by Boris Johnson - who has lied repeatedly throughout his journalistic and political careers - of his time in hospital might not be 100% accurate. ü§î #BBCNews #Marr #Ridge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatHarkin7 That's one of many known unknowns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RFewtrellUK The correct figure was a drop of 416.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kissmibadeye So far as we know they're still counting tests posted out but not yet returned, some of which may never be returned. And of those returned will they be counted a second time?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wilde Not for the first time a Minister mis-read their script and didn't realise they were talking nonsense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kissmibadeye It was given as 105,937.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not one of these 'journalists' has raised the issue of yesterday's fiddled test figures which was an outrageous and calculated attempt at deception by the Government. #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anmol3 Will any of the journalists point out his error? I'm not holding my breath.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably better if Jenny Harries doesn't talk about 'exciting adventures' at the present time. #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've just checked back. Yesterday Hancock said 15,111 were in hospital with Coronavirus. Today Jenrick said 14,695 people are currently in hospital with coronavirus, down 15,111 from the previous day. Yet again they can't read out statistics accurately. #DailyBriefing #BBCNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A drop of 15,000 in the number in hospital in 24 hours seems a very high figure. #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackBob1952 I won't be blindly loyal to the Leader of the Labour Party whether it's Corbyn or Starmer. If I think they're getting something wrong I'll criticise them and I think Starmer has got a lot wrong which is why I couldn't vote for him. But I remain a member.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Blimey! I wonder what this man's "gorgeous wife and four daughters" make of his language.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Former Tory Leader Michael Howard is on #LBC attacking the BBC for daring to criticise the Government (occasionally!) while praising the Labour Opposition. I wonder if that provokes a moment's concern among the Starmer fan club?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Commuters taking their temperatures before getting on a bus or train won't be much use with those who are pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic.I hope a lot of this stuff in today's papers is just speculation to fill column inches. #LBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pocketricks @BBCNaga Whether it's with tests or with surveys the number sent out and the number returned are two different things and often hugely different figures.

<|startoftext|>In the 1960s social issues were explored in the Wednesday Plays and Plays for Today which were done and dusted in an hour. Now it's in the soaps and spread over months.

<|startoftext|>@Redpev It's the oldest tactic in the Tory playbook. When you're in a corner fiddle the figures. Remember how in the Thatcher years they massaged the unemployment figures by switching people from unemployment benefit to sickness benefit.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Someone told me earlier their council had invited over-65s with symptoms to go to a drive-through testing centre. In light of what we heard today about postal tests I'm now wondering if such invites were counted in the test statistics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Evilgenius222 I thought she'd probably got that wrong.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gildy61 I did the same one year! And I know it wasn't recorded as having been done because months later I was told off by the GP for not doing it. But with the #COVID_19 test it can still be sitting on the hall table and be recorded as done. They thought they'd get away with that one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting answer to a question originally evaded was that home tests are counted as test done when they are sent out not when returned or tested. If a bowel cancer test was sent to me but I didn't return it would it be recorded as a test done? #DailyBriefinguk #BBCNews #LBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good grief! Clip on #BBCNews of Matt Hancock strutting down Downing Street today grinning like a cat that's got the cream. A little inappropriate as the death toll relentlessly climbs to the worst in Europe. @BBCNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the largest care home operators has lambasted the Government's shambolic testing system and said Boris Johnson was "at best disingenuous"* when he said we'd come through the peak.  *that handy euphemism for 'lying his bloody head off'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone who trusts the Government to bring us safely out of this semi-lockdown should remember this is the gallery of goons who allowed 3,000 Madrid fans to go to Liverpool when Madrid was a virus hotspot and 250,000 people to pack into Cheltenham racecourse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markfrank60 @sharpeleven I don't think anyone has a problem with the concept but many if not most of these people looked the other way when the Tories were de-funding and privatising the NHS and freezing #NHS workers' pay for years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sharpeleven None of the altruistic weekly clappers and pan-bangers in my street have knocked to see if I'm OK and some of them would struggle to say 'Good morning' if you passed them in the street.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CoolJayne Tory.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoolJayne On a more positive note my local council rang me to check I was OK and see if I needed anything or if I just wanted a chat with someone. They're doing that weekly for 'shielded' people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoolJayne Which means the symptoms would have to be very mild if you're expected to travel to a test centre.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only a few weeks ago our horrified media were saying 'what is it about Italy and the Italians that they've had 14,000 deaths?'. Today as we hit 27,000 deaths the media can interview our Ministers without even mentioning the UK's fatalities &amp; our PM boasts it's not 500k. #r4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As you know I don't have a sceptical bone in my body but it's hard to see how such a massive increase in tests could have happened in two days when we know how hard it is to book them online. A convenient distraction from the death toll though. #r4today #BBCNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe next week we could go outside and have a 2 minute silence for the many dead #NHS and care workers? I'm finding the current cheering and whooping and banging of saucepans a bit distasteful in the face of such a death toll.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itiddly That's mild compared to my own "French". You should hear what I shout at the TV!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today Johnson repeated the same nonsense I commented on 5 weeks ago: saying it's right to wait until the virus is spreading like wildfire before imposing a lockdown. The opposite is true: lockdown early and you stop the spread &amp; save lives. #DailyBriefinguk #C4News<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unlike other Ministers who have done the #DailyBriefinguk Johnson is not allowing any follow-up questions in this farrago of falsehoods.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the international comparisons are as worthless as Johnson, backed up by a servile Whitty, claims then it follows that Johnson's claim that we have been much more successful than other countries is also meaningless. #DailyBriefinguk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #DailyBriefinguk would be improved if we had some questions from independent scientists but that would probably be too uncomfortable for Whitty and Vallance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tinalouiseUK Yes, they've got so much wrong already I worry about what they might get wrong in the next phases.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Given it's Boris Johnson I don't why my jaw hit the floor but apparently it's all been a huge success because we didn't have 500,000 deaths. #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BBCNews is still pumping out this false information 3 hours later. Over-65s without symptoms cannot get tested! @BBCNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This isn't surprising. He's someone who thinks there's an homogenous Jewish community, all represented by the Board of Deputies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCNews Your correspondent Nick Triggle said on the TV News at One that everyone over 65 can be tested even if they have no symptoms. That is not true. They must have symptoms. #BBCNews  https://t.co/TW3tx1ElHq<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@susanvbrewster And as we just heard on #r4today news at 8, South Korea quarantines all new arrivals for 14 days, something our Government scientists refuse to do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One thing is certain: if a mixture of sentimentality, self-congratulation, national exceptionalism, vacuous slogans and gestures, and wartime analogies could destroy the #COVID19 virus the UK would have the lowest death rate in the world. #r4today #ThursdayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Forgot to mention yesterday, but I'm sure others did: at #PMQs Starmer reassured Raab that it wouldn't really matter if the Govt missed its testing target today. One wonders what other failures our new 'forensic' Opposition Leader will be so forgiving of in future. #r4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you look at today's front pages, on a day of devastating death figures, you can see why our papers are regarded internationally as the worst in the world. The Mirror the only honourable exception today. #r4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>High Fives in #itv Towers tonight. ITV programmes the top two trending topics on Twitter and the only complaints about #mancsinmumbai are that it should have been twice as long.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The 100 year old man on #itvnews got a birthday card from the Queen on which she was smiling. On the one she sent my Dad she wasn't. "She looks constipated" my Dad said as he tossed it aside, looking decidedly unimpressed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jasonoruairc Not really. In Starmer's Labour you mustn't get too angry in case it upsets the focus groups.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Is anyone keeping a list of all the things that are "under constant review and discussion"? It will be a fucking long list. #DailyBriefinguk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealSueKelly @BBCNews And they do have that figure but they never announce it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mail's Jason Groves uses #DailyBriefing to do a commercial for the Daily Mail.

<|startoftext|>It must be Cummings' decision to keep sending Junior Ministers to be eviscerated by Piers Morgan on #GMB, often young women by the way because a portion of the audience will feel sorry for them when they get a grilling from Morgan.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Tudortweet Hospital deaths for England, Wales, Scotland and N. Ireland are released separately in early afternoon and then the combined figure for the UK as a whole is announced later in the day. Is that what you mean?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fail by #C4news researchers. They tried to set up a heated debate based on John Caudwell wanting restrictions lifted straight away. But he doesn't and he and the scientist are in broad agreement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Government want to be judged not on the number of deaths which is among the worst in the world but on whether NHS capacity was exceeded. One reason it wasn't is that thousands were left to die in care homes and the community, exact number still officially uncounted. #C4News<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"How soon will I be able to hug my grandchildren?" was the toughest question of 15,000 submitted that YouGov could find to put to Matt Hancock? Yet again they're taking us all for mugs. #DailyBriefing #BBCNews #LBC #SkyNews<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>When Italy had over 15,000 deaths our media was full of speculation about what unique circumstances could have given them such a high death toll (multi-generational families was often suggested).........the implication being it couldn't possibly happen in the UK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peter4buckley A policeman stopped us racing our bogies downhill round a blind corner not because we might be killed but in case we frightened some nearby horses.

<|startoftext|>Alok Sharma didn't lick his fingers like Raab or turn a statistic into gibberish like Patel but in his robotic speak-your-weight way he's somehow managed to make himself a contender for the coveted Worst Minister at Daily Briefing Award. #DailyBriefing #LBC #BBCNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today I listened to all the #DailyBriefing on #LBC where Eddie Mair interpolates his own comments such as "On this cool evening I hope you're enjoying all this hot air" and notes all the questions unanswered. Today's with Alok Sharma was particularly appalling.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Matt Hancock has replaced his usual #NHS badge with one of his 'new' CARE badges, which reportedly cost more than a care worker earns in an hour. Hope he doesn't wear it to the supermarket and get priority shopping he's not entitled to. #HealthCommittee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HughIWalker Getting things the wrong way round sums up the Government's handling of this crisis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Matt Hancock says only when we've got infection rate under control might we start testing/isolating people flying into the country. Surely doing that now would help us get the infection rate under control? #HealthCommittee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Appearing at the Health Committee on Zoom, Matt Hancock is sitting in front of the Queen's Head. No, not a pub. A huge representation of the Queen's head on his wall. I wonder if he's one of those wingnuts who stuffs his home with Royal memorabilia. He's daft enough.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DrBob317 Well, his first article as Leader was for a Murdoch paper and was behind a paywall.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irisstylosa Yes, that was a revealing and worrying moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aside from the Westminster Bridge fiasco, in some terraced streets it's impossible to stand at your front door and be 2 metres from your next door neighbour. This weekly 'go outside and clap' during a 'stay at home' campaign was always a bit odd and potentially risky.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GordonRwhgordon That's been slightly modified today in new guidance to the police from the CPS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's interesting. Starmer tells #Newscast he didn't enjoy the leadership campaign because he had to sell himself to the members. That wasn't a problem for Corbyn because he wasn't selling himself but a set of values and policies and he'd never wanted to be leader anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tudortweet I'll have to pass on that one. Sorry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't think Buckland meant to say that. Cummings will have him on the Naughty Step tomorrow. #bbcqt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tudortweet I find them all equally dismal. I suppose of the politicians Priti Patel has to have been the worst. I doubt they'll risk using her again if she can't read out a number without turning it into gibberish and not even noticing what she's done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is #C4News inflicting the witless witterings of Iain Duncan Smith on viewers?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bizarre long commercial for BT in middle of #itvnews in which Clare Balding demonstrates WhatsApp and uses it to chat to celebrity friends like Robbie Savage, supposedly to help us during lockdown. BT, Balding and ITV can do one. ü§¨<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ladyblues666 I suppose it's because the chart is only about domestic travel and there are few if any domestic flights now. Not that many international ones either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chart today showed an increase in transport use, especially motor vehicles. Odd that Patrick Vallance didn't mention that. #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Keep hearing people talk of 'podiums' at the #DailyBriefing. Surely they are lecterns, not podiums. Podiums are what you stand on at an Olympics medal-giving ceremony. And this shower won't be getting any medals for their handling of this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Evilgenius222 I don't mind Oliver. But unfortunately I can't watch cookery shows any more than I can watch property shows. They bore me to tears.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had to use up some weird milk I had to buy when normal milk was unavailable so made a Bread Pudding - with apple and a dash of Calvados. Improvising around basic recipes is half the fun of cooking. It's also how the celebrity chef spivs make their money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@barspence7 @BBCr4today I don't suppose Evan Davis played the clip of Priti Patel mangling the testing figures and said "That's obviously gibberish" as Eddie Mair did on #LBC?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@owencocoefc Notable that #C4News man wasn't offered a follow-up question.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CuckooInternet @martinjhamer But OpenReach only take instructions from ISPs, not consumers. And my ISP @TalkTalk  hasn't responded to any of my communications. The current crisis is obviously a factor, but even so.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andywartrol Indeed. But that would be Marxism apparently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martinjhamer It's personal for me: I've been two weeks with no landline or broadband and no prospect of it being fixed any time soon. If I hadn't bought a smartphone last year I'd be screwed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another video link goes belly up. This crisis, including the #DailyBriefing, hasn't been a great advertisement for the UK's digital technology.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Rishi Sunak hopes people are unaware the economy was already teetering on the edge of recession before the virus struck.

<|startoftext|>In addition to my Labour Party subs I made modest donations to recent election campaigns and now find staff at HQ were undermining both the Leader and the election effort.

<|startoftext|>Martha Kearney makes a correction to what she said earlier. But I can't understand why Anneliese Dodds didn't correct the claim that Keir Starmer had been asked to join COBRA meetings. Was she that ignorant? Is Dodds another one over-promoted by the new leader?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>When Labour HQ tried to stop me voting in one of the leadership elections by claiming I wasn't on an Electoral Register I'd been on for 30+ years I though it possible it could be just an error. But after reading #LabourLeaks I'm not so sure. Happened to many others.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mcsainsbury @steverichards14 I agree he's generally better than the others. But I was disappointed in his book. I found it rambling and unstructured, perhaps because it was adapted from his unscripted TV talks. Also contained a few errors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stumbled on 'Left Out Of Power' on #R4 - Steve Richards on the future for Labour. Not a word on the role of the media in our politics and not a word from any rank and file party member. Lots from Blair, Hain, Charles Clarke. Narrow &amp; shallow stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#itvnews reporter asked Matt Hancock an unwelcome question about #PPE so he didn't offer her a follow-up question. Tried to do the same to the #skynews man. They don't like it up 'em. #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This may well be an unprecedented situation but it certainly wasn't unforeseeable. A pandemic like this was war-gamed as recently as 2016 and the probable issues that highlighted (which no doubt had a price tag attached) seem to have been ignored. #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fenladybiker I certainly agree that people can never be truly independent from the people who appointed them to their jobs. Same is true of, for example, the Governor of the Bank of England.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Professor Van-Tam should be a politician. He answers a different question to the one the #LBC journo asked which wasn't about 'closing borders' but about letting people fly in without any checks on them at all or even giving them advice. #DailyBriefing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Evilgenius222 Exactly. I'm glad my dentist puts on new gloves for each patient!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Boris Johnson said - idiotically in my view - there was no point in taking strong distancing measures when the virus wasn't spreading very much. Surely the opposite is true. We wasted a golden window of opportunity to reduce the number of infections and deaths. #bbcqt<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Would be surprising if the lockdown wasn't reducing the spread of infection.

<|startoftext|>I retweeted this earlier. I now read the Government will repay the money to the Bank of England by the end of the year. How will they do that? Borrowing in the markets? Or swingeing cuts to public spending? Or big tax rises? Or a mixture of those?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DebbieM1dge Rayner also signed the pledge to speak only to mainstream Jewish organisations as defined by the Board of Deputies. The only person who had the guts and principles not to do so was Richard Burgon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This morning Starmer and Rayner have held a meeting with leaders of Jewish organisations. But not of course with any Jewish organisations that supported Corbyn, the ones the Board of Deputies dismiss as 'fringe'.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Only the other day some people on here were insisting to me that Boris Johnson was only pretending to have Covid19 and calling me a fool for believing it. I'm glad I blocked some of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dominic Raab must be a spin doctor's nightmare. Instead of saying he last spoke to Johnson on Saturday all he had to say was "I'm in regular contact with the Prime Minister". #PressConference #C4News<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I haven't heard any talk of Starmer "tightening his grip on the party", a phrase that was common in the media during the Corbyn years (although Corbyn initially gave jobs to some of his bitterest enemies). #LabourReshuffle #ShadowCabinet<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Wiblicks I hope not! My defence of those paintings was one of the reasons his father wrote to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sad to hear of the death of Lord Bath.

Old-fashioned courtesy from a colourful individualist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peter4buckley At a time like this we need politicians who can communicate precisely and unambiguously. Instead we have drips like Matt Hancock.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gildy61 I hadn't wanted to criticise Starmer this early but it's a struggle. Like putting his first article in a Murdoch paper behind a paywall which means many if not most Labour members can't read it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any sight of a letter Starmer wrote to Jewish Voice For Labour? Oh sorry, I forgot he'd signed a BOD pledge to only consult with Jewish organisations that the BOD approve of.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Juliadoe51 No she didn't challenge it at all. But that's why she's in that job.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's a pity that David Miliband and others are unable to congratulate Keir Starmer without taking another swipe at Jeremy Corbyn. It's the kind of nasty, spiteful, ungracious behaviour that Corbyn himself would never engage in. #LabourLeadershipElection<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gove is championing the right of the media to scrutinise. Yet in the early weeks of this crisis No 10 was still barring Ministers from going on #r4today and other programmes. Not all of us have short memories. #PressBriefing #BBCNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see Jess Phillips has said she'll accept a Shadow Cabinet post before she's even been offered one. She's beyond parody. #LabourLeadershipElection<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For example Sam Coates of #skynews says Starmer will now have a free rein to take the party in whatever direction he wants. With that level of ignorance he'd fail a Politics A Level.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's remarkable how most of the political journalists think a Labour Leader has complete autonomy in deciding Labour Party policy. #LabourLeadershipElection<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrCAClarke @UKLabour Yes, although Corbyn has had at least one meeting with Johnson in No 10 during this crisis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kellydanceclub His letter only invites other party leaders to a briefing with the scientific advisers, something that is fairly commonplace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here we go: 'Let's work together Johnson tells Opposition parties'. Something he wouldn't be saying if things weren't unravelling and the papers turning on him. Privy Council briefings: fine. Anything more than that: run a mile.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Useless @BBCNews has just replayed Matt Hancock saying the 100,000 tests are for the whole UK without informing viewers that No 10 has since denied that and said it's for England only. #BBCNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlisonSaint It wasn't my own idea. I saw it somewhere on social media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@debswj62 @adamboultonSKY @BBCHughPym Imagine the media reaction if it was Diane Abbott.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It gets worse: No 10 has said the 100,000 test target is for England only and not as Matt Hancock had insisted today UK-wide.  Hancock is clearly not fit for purpose, constantly talking nonsense and contradicting himself. #BBCNews @BBCNews #COVID19Pandemic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blakeyblogs I see you're reporting what Matt Hancock told Adam Boulton about the nature of the tests rather than the completely different thing he told your colleague @BBCHughPym. If you see Hancock ask him which version is correct.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Antonineone1 I had to check it wasn't a parody account. I often have to with Jess Phillips.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MatthewConnolly @adamboultonSKY @BBCHughPym I noticed that. It was pure Thick Of It. Then he corrected himself. Probably someone gestured to him out of shot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Matt Hancock tells @adamboultonSKY on #skynews the 100,000 tests will all be swab tests. Moments later on #BBCNews he tells @BBCHughPym they will be a mix of all types of tests. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just moments later Hancock has now said the opposite on #BBCNews: that the 100,000 tests are a mix of all kinds of test. Extraordinary! I hope some journalists pick up on this. @BBCNews @BBCPolitics @Channel4News @Peston @itvnews #LBC @bbclaurak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yesterday we were told the 100,000 tests by the end of April would be a mix of the swab test and the antibody test. Matt Hancock has just told #skynews they will all be the former because he doesn't have any antibody tests that work. #MakingItUpAsTheyGoAlong #COVID19Pandemic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the consequences of our privatised, fragmented telecoms sector is that if your landline stops working you can't report it to BT Openreach yourself but have to go through your broadband provider &amp; in present circumstances mine is not responding to most customers.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The long, pretentious essay I wrote on Dylan Thomas's Fern Hill when I was 16 has mercifully been lost. But the poem moves me far more now as the intimations of mortality in the final verse resonate in a way they didn't back then. #r4today<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>As a former banker Rishi Sunak must have known that if there were any loopholes in his loans scheme the banks wouldn't hesitate to use them. So I don't accept that these were accidental flaws or glitches. #r4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kearney asks what proportion of the 100,000 tests will be swab tests and what proportion the new antigen tests. Newton doesn't answer the question. Kearney replies "Understood." How is this useless woman still in a job? #r4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shillcock_paul I had an argument with a supermarket worker over that. She showed me 'Not suitable for freezing' on the milk carton. But it's perfectly safe to do so and many people do it. I've been freezing it in ice cube trays for use in cups of tea.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>At least we know about Johnson's illness. His hero Churchill had a stroke while Prime Minister and the public weren't told. But as Churchill was half-pissed much of the time I don't suppose a stroke made much difference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great question from #Independent reporter* on the extent to which #NHS capacity has been reduced since 2010 - though not giving the figure of 17,000 beds cut at a time of rising demanding and increasing population. #CoronaVirusUpdate *Not properly answered of course.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NHS Chief Simon Stevens called private hospitals 'independent hospitals' in the same way that people erroneously call private schools 'independent schools'. He did of course spend years as a senior executive in the private health sector himself. #CoronavirusUpdate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matwatkinson I agree. My moral code probably isn't as strict as it should be but I can never wish illness on anyone however much I dislike them. That's a dangerous line to cross.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seems like only the other week Boris Johnson was boasting of still shaking hands with everyone he met, even in hospitals. Actually it was indeed only the other week. (In case you haven't heard he's tested positive for Coronavirus).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Remarkable how many journalists have got the hots for Rishi Sunak just because he can look into a camera and read out recycled platitudes like "we're all in it together" without flailing his arms or ruffling his hair. #r4today<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gildy61 I was reassured to see my Tesco Express now has strict rules in place, someone on the door operating a 'one out, one in' policy and people queuing 2 metres apart, which makes it safer if I do have to go there.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Hughesy53 They often do that me too so I usually do click &amp; collect. This time I was able to follow his van on a map on their tracking app as it moved along the street so I was at the door like a spider waiting to pounce on a fly.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Pavilaxed @BBCNews @BBCPolitics It was still a valid point. A neighbour who is a builder told me young temporary labourers were as much use as a chocolate teapot. Khan also said every Cabinet Minister opposed him. Of course they blocked him from COBRA for several weeks.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In pandemic simulations and war-gaming done over the years panic-buying and hoarding must have featured.

<|startoftext|>The Government line from Stephen Barclay and others is that helping the self-employed is logistically too difficult.

<|startoftext|>Maybe it's me, but Sunak's answer to a question about how his scheme works for people on zero hours and in the gig economy didn't seem very clear. #CoronaVirusUpdate #CoronaCrisis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guardian's Marina Hyde writes of seeing Boris Johnson's "smirk kick back in, live on air" at each #CoronaVirusUpdate, something that struck me too.

<|startoftext|>Guardian: "Government was today actively discussing a new clampdown on London with pubs, cinemas and gyms being ordered to close." Why only London?

<|startoftext|>@BlackBob1952 @BBCNews There's a failure of messaging by the Government. Some people think if they go in an empty pub they're safe. But a previous customer could have cough or sneezed on to a hard surface. Not being close to other people is not in itself enough.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Cranehillbarn #BBCNews still too London-centric. From their reporting you'd think it was only happening in London. But social media tells another story, as so often. @BBCNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not just in London but across the country that significant numbers are still going to cafes and bars. The Tory ideology of individual choice is all very well but this puts other people's lives at risk too. Time to shut them down. #CoronaVirusUpdate #bbcqt @BBCNews<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Piece in Guardian from an academic tells me scientists have found that adults aged 20-50 make most of their contacts in workplaces &amp; over-65s make over half their contacts in other settings  such as shops, restaurants and leisure centres.

<|startoftext|>Both Johnson and Sunak were not very convincing when questioned on the detail. Even #BBCNews correspondent is talking of the 'glaring omissions' in their plans. A lifetime's experience has taught me to be sceptical of men who boast about the size of their package. #Corvid19uk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I also raised an eyebrow when Sunak said people in immediate difficulties should contact their local authorities who have funds available. Really? #COVID2019 #Corvid19uk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>One for the media to ask about at today's press conference. But don't hold your breath. #COVID2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Government insist the #Brexit transition period won't be extended. Because as #COVID2019 inflicts massive damage on the UK economy it's vital that we continue the work of erecting barriers with our biggest and closest trading partners. #BBCNews #Corvid19uk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SueMMcGuire @BethUrmston @Socialist_Chris @AndyBurnhamGM @Debbie_abrahams @SocialistVoice @JackDunc1 @Charlotte71 That''s fine but it also relies on the very elderly doing their own ID checks when they answer the door.

<|startoftext|>How fast could a modern car production line at somewhere like Nissan be converted from making cars to making ventilators? Obviously I've no idea. But it would have been good for #Marr to ask Hancock that question.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Government say they are following scientific advice. But Irish Government is going further and faster than us despite having far fewer cases. So either Ireland has different scientific advice or one of the two Governments is ignoring their scientific advice. #CobraMeeting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When #BBCNews says "465 people have been infected" in the UK they should really be saying "465 people are known to have been infected". Medical experts think the true number could be many thousands or even tens of thousands. #CoronavirusPandemic<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Fgh22Gill It's not my interpretation. It says: "Labour must engage with the Jewish community [Is there only one?] via its main representative groups and not through fringe organisations or individuals." "Fringe"=those not sharing the views &amp; politics of the BOD.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In his speech Boris Johnson is boasting that some of our rules &amp; protections go further than those of the EU.

<|startoftext|>A lot of the tech products I've bought recently have been made in China including my most recent PC. More relevantly to #Huawei is that many if not most of our energy smart meters are made in China, something GCHQ was allegedly concerned about.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>O'Brien still attacking straw men conspiracy theories over French strikes. FWIW I don't think there was any order from on high. And more 'serious' papers have covered them. It's broadcast news that mostly hasn't. That's down to news editors &amp; their news values &amp; biases. #LBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EliModnar In my area Virgin broadband often goes down so whilst I have their TV I don't have their broadband. Best not to put all your eggs in one basket. When their TV goes down I still have the internet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EliModnar I think it's a 4G mast. Its main benefit is providing broadband to homes and businesses in more remote rural areas a long way from exchanges. Not sure it's commercially viable without public money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EliModnar I have the option of getting my home broadband from a local mast but I've never done it because it means putting a dish on the wall of my house and as I'm near a fibre-connected street cabinet the copper wires do a pretty good job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was Robinson confusing fast fibre home broadband with 5G mobile networks? It was the former the Tories promised. But I'm no expert so maybe the two are linked. #r4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackBob1952 There's an old saying that Oppositions don't win elections, Governments lose them.

<|startoftext|>@BlackBob1952 But Scotland has its own left of centre party in the SNP who are in Government there.

<|startoftext|>James O'Brien now calling those of us who complain about the lack of coverage of the strikes in France conspiracy theorists.

<|startoftext|>@GaryOpinionated And of course some of the categories are not mutually exclusive. Some of the gay men killed at Auschwitz were also Jewish; same probably true of some of the disabled killed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Predictable but still disgusting: #LBC uses the Auschwitz anniversary to play a piece by its Political Editor Theo Usherwood accusing Corbyn of being personally anti-semitic and comparing him with Hungary's Victor Orb√°n.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In his Guardian article today John Harris begins by accusing Starmer and Long-Bailey of  "saying nothing much at all" and then ends with the vacuous line that the Left "needs its own national story". I won't link, it might annoy you as much as it did me. Typical Guardian drivel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad an Auschwitz survivor mentions gypsies. 21,000 Sinti &amp; Roma died there. Gay men, the disabled &amp; sick were also killed. But non-Jewish victims not being named by #BBCNews who just say "most of them were Jews". Disrespectful to the other victims. #r4today<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DrRJSimpson No. Read my other tweets on this. It's a separate menu of different meals, resembling a children's menu, available only at certain times, not smaller portions of the normal menu.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jdl101026 A bugbear of mine is that TV news items about over-60s (or even over-50s!) are accompanied by library film of one of these: Tea dance Slow-motion aerobics Bowling club. (No criticism of anyone who enjoys those activities).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KennyBaker1948 @franjangle My teeth are like stars........they come out at night. #OldJokesHome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@franjangle It's not smaller portions of their regular menu. It's a separate menu of different dishes like a children's menu. Mostly soft, pappy stuff because nobody over 60 has any teeth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Notonyournelly8 Thanks. I don't think I've ever had so many stupid replies to a tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnneRushworth @DENISEL37953929 @psreklaw_p A lot of people have misunderstood this. The pub is not offering smaller portions of their regular menu. It's a special menu for over-60s and its content is remarkably like a kids' menu. It's only available on certain days at certain times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gordonwasok How is that relevant to my tweet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GazSez @sue_lees I should add they're only offering this on some weekday lunchtimes and the content of their special 'senior citizen menu' is indistinguishable from a children's menu. They seem to think as soon as you turn 60 you enter a second childhood.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GazSez @sue_lees I'm sure there are people of all ages who want small portions for whatever reason. So put on the menu 'smaller portions available on request'. It's the implication that all over-60s eat like sparrows I was complaining about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sue_lees Then don't advertise it as for over-60s. Age is irrelevant in this context.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A local pub is advertising 'smaller portion meals for the over-60s'. üò≤ To state the obvious, millions of over-60s are still working full-time, some doing hard physical work. And those of us who aren't still eat a full-size adult meal. #EverydayAgeism<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If James O'Brien is going to have a go at the Church of England this morning that will be interesting because the Catholic church of which he is a member takes exactly the same line on sex outside marriage and gay sex. #LBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The coverage of the Coronavirus has become very repetitive. Same questions asked, same answers given, over and over again on a loop. #BBCNews #r4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If, as the vicar says, the elders of the Church of England - poor things - are still grappling with the issue of whether it's sinful for a straight couple in a civil partnership to have sex, surely their statement yesterday was a bit of a premature ejaculation? #r4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The members of the Citizens' Assembly on climate change are people who agreed to spend a weekend listening to dozens of speeches &amp; presentations, so highly atypical and unrepresentative of the population as a whole. #r4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reading the Church of England statement I see they are as unhappy that you can enter a civil partnership without any intention of having sex as they are with sex outside marriage or gay sex. From which I infer that sex in marriage is as compulsory as sex outside it is sinful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KASEYKAY19 Don't know. I wondered that myself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KennyBaker1948 When a Tory MP can go on TV and say the Left has culturally appropriated the Durham Miners' Gala you realise what a deep abyss of ignorance and delusion some of these people inhabit. #PoliticsLive @BBCPolitics<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LeftieK13 I clashed with Derbyshire on Twitter years ago when she'd said something inaccurate (but to the advantage of the Tories) on her radio show. My conclusion from our exchanges was that she was a bit thick.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chalkpithouse @PhilipJohnAdam1 @MikeBatt01 I've criticised all of them for doing it. I singled out RLB in that tweet because she'd spoken of empowering members. Agreeing to contentious demands of an outside organisation that supports the Tories didn't sit well with that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CITYBRUCE @BBCPolitics I should have made clear the programme was talking about CBD products not medicinal cannabis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For anyone familiar with the lifestyle of Prince Charles he must be one of the last people on the planet who should be giving lectures on climate change. Yet toadying broadcasters report it uncritically of course.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@headline5 And Dawn Butler.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealSueKelly The devout Catholic Duncan Smith has re-written 'suffer not the little children' as 'let the little children suffer'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Duncan Smith says a lot of claims are being made about cannabis oil products that are not true. People buy them thinking their lives will be transformed and it's nonsense. So a bit like #Brexit then? #PoliticsLive @BBCPolitics<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WarmongerHodges No, what it means is that there'll be an even bigger shitstorm when the party as a whole doesn't sign up to the BOD demands. Now was the time for candidates to put down a marker, as Burgon and Butler have done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhilipJohnAdam1 @MikeBatt01 Any Labour Government is better for the worst off than a Tory Government. That's why I voted for Wilson, Blair and Brown rather than take the view they weren't ideologically pure enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhilipJohnAdam1 @MikeBatt01 There's also the possibility that Starmer might do the least badly with the wider electorate and what a disaster that would be. üòÑ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@j_sutherland2 Voting isn't compulsory. I can abstain. But the Deputy Leadership is much easier because both Burgon and Butler had the principles and guts not to accede to the BOD demands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My Twitter is full of Long-Bailey's plans to further democratise Labour and give power to members. All well and good.

<|startoftext|>Tory peer Danny Finkelstein was on #bbcpm talking about the horrific experiences of his family as victims of &amp; refugees from the Nazis.

<|startoftext|>Unconfirmed reports that Jess Phillips will withdraw from the contest today. If so, presumably to avoid the indignity of not getting on to the final ballot. #PoliticsLive @BBCPolitics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woman on #r4today plays the old 'going through a phase' card in relation to #LGTB children. Whilst it's true that sexuality isn't necessarily fixed or binary, for many, depending on their position on the spectrum of sexuality, it will be the same at 70 as it was at 10.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think Fox might have faced a very different reaction if he'd denied or downplayed anti-semitism in this country. #r4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sturgess_steve Two points: 'getting on my chest' is not a figure of speech. And I don't dislike orchestras per se. I just don't like them infesting TV dramas to create moods or tension which a decent script, actors and director should be able to do unaided. üòä<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By the second episode of Sky's #Cobra it's starting to get on my tits. Partly it's the bloody orchestra that keeps striking up especially during the romantic sub-plot. I hate that in dramas. And really it's like an episode of Casualty spread over 6 hours.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>'Royal expert' talks of big problem of how to now introduce Harry &amp; Meghan at an event.

<|startoftext|>It's true the #LabourHustings is a bad format. But if there'd been greater challenge &amp; scrutiny Phillips would have done even worse. Asked on #Ridge the cost of her one policy on free childcare she had no idea.....after claiming Labour hadn't explained how they'd pay for things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quite enjoyed Sky's expensive-looking new series #Cobra. David Haig to some extent reprises his Thick Of It political role but here as a right-wing, venomous Home Secretary. Now he's older he's even more scary. All the characters are satisfyingly dislikeable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Phillips claims her dismal performance at the Liverpool hustings was because she was trying to appear statesmanlike*. We'd never have known.

<|startoftext|>@BethUrmston Ridiculous format too. No follow-up to the broad question on the BOD pledges or forensic analysis of those 10 pledges, some of which are fine but others have deeply troubled the membership. #LabourHustings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Long-Bailey says she wants to work with "the Jewish Community". But she's signed up to the BOD's demand that she works only with themselves and Jewish groups that they approve of. #LabourHustings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're 30 minutes in and I haven't heard a single policy yet. A Niagara of platitudes and clich√©s though. #LabourHustings<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChrisGiles7 Because she's an idiot. And also unnecessarily dragging anti-semitism into her answer.......all the candidates keep doing that even when they haven't been asked about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fraser Nelson used the phrase 'real racism' by which I assume he means something like screaming the N word in a black person's face. This reminds me of those in the past (like Ken Clarke) who have talked about 'real rape' by which they meant violent stranger rape. #PoliticsLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Both Long-Bailey and Nandy claim people want power because they think everyone is like themselves. Most people just want to elect competent people who will give them a decent quality of life. #PoliticsLive  https://t.co/NfktYVPqy3<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WysoxxTech @shaunjlawson No but I'll certainly judge harshly any candidate who employs a private healthcare lobbyist when party policy is to stop the creeping privatisation of the NHS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WysoxxTech @shaunjlawson Occasional impatience with TV interviewers. I never saw Corbyn adopt that angry tone towards a party member at a public meeting.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Big royal stories must be a joy to our gutter press because they can make up any old nonsense and quotes from 'royal sources' and 'royal aides'. The family themselves rarely rebut anything and #BBCNews on #R4 will read the crap out without any caveats.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@matthewlambert_ Her biggest faux pas was to laugh when #Marr said the words 'Jess Phillips Prime Minister', although that would be the reaction of most other people too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jess Phillips like a rabbit in the headlights when #Marr is unkind enough to ask her about specific policies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Marr states as a fact that Jess Phillip is "one of the most charismatic MPs in Parliament." There's a frozen smoked haddock in my freezer with more charisma than Jess Phillips.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GParselle @louisesdad This is only happening because it's a project of Prince William who just happens to be FA President and the screening is at FA Cup matches. That's how things work in the UK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think this is a misunderstanding by @BBCNews. I don't think Corbyn asked for a meeting of the Privy Council (which would have to include the Queen). He asked for a personal briefing as Opposition Leader "on Privy Council terms" i.e. confidential.#BBCNews  https://t.co/ql22I9tIZa<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm leaving Twitter a bit earlier tonight. All these photos of Jess Phillips are making me feel unwell. ü§Æ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Isobel_waby Indeed. Under-fund mental health services to the point of collapse, then tell men to look after their own mental health in a video narrated by a member of a family who never use the NHS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A football crowd is a captive audience so making them watch a video on mental health (or any other subject) just before kick-off, as is happening this weekend, makes me uneasy. A football stadium should be a place of escapism, nothing more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was incorrect. I think they played the Pompeo clip three times in the 1pm News. At the beginning, during their report from Washington and again at the end.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Chantepoule It's not splitting hairs. They mean two different things. Virgin birth means it wasn't the result of sexual intercourse. Immaculate conception means Christ was born without Original Sin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hardennizen It matters only because O'Brien is such an arrogant, conceited know-all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha! James O'Brien is, as he often tells us, a Catholic but confuses the 'virgin birth' with the 'immaculate conception'. A common error but he was educated by monks at Ampleforth. #LBC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Was that wishful thinking by the continuity announcer when he said #TheTrialOfChristineKeeler concludes on Sunday?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Nepotism is so ingrained in the British Establishment that Charles Moore has now featured two members of his family in his #r4today. But his trans nephew learning for the first time what unpleasant things his uncle had said about trans people was quite a moment.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@martynware @Yah_Reed Thanks Martyn. Some think I was too robust in my criticism of Nandy. But she and others have spent the last three years attacking the party leadership in the media so anyone who thinks I'm going to go easy on them now has another think coming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't contest that this was a very bad result for Labour. But as a bit of balance to all the hyperbole, Corbyn's Labour won 38 more seats than John Major managed to win in 1997 (203/165). #Marr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Infuriating how these Westminster journalists generalise about, and stereotype, the working class - particularly the northern working class. And I think Fraser Nelson just upped Johnson's Oxford degree from a Second to a First. But facts eh, who needs them? #Marr<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That was when I thought the story was probably true: when Theo Usherwood came on the Eddie Mair Show and said a Labour activist had been arrested. I assumed that came from the police but it hadn't.  O'Brien now pretending that didn't happen so he's as culpable. #LBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MickPat56 He referred to them by their job titles but not by their names.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>O'Brien has solved the problem by pretending that Theo Usherwood didn't report the falsehood. But he did, on the Eddie Mair Show. Heard it myself live. He even said the Labour activist had been arrested. #LBC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BethUrmston I guess they thought they could safely do so because the EU-wide rule was soon to change anyway. It does mean of course that another of Johnson's lies is that we can only do the same if we leave the EU.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In election news Nigel Farage is visiting a company that specialises in 'super duplex fabrications'. That would also be a home-from-home for Boris Johnson. Some jokes write themselves. #GE2019<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@socialistMike Some of it is that. The rest is just ignorance and stupidity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xtc_uk You can see the breakdown of respondents to the YouGov poll here along with the weighting. No such data exists for Twitter polls.  https://t.co/QebVrhslon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do so many people think a self-selecting Twitter poll is more accurate than a representative poll conducted by a polling company? The latter have their flaws. The former are meaningless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How predictable that the first clip from last night that #r4today play is Johnson's IRA smear. And why is Fact Check Man today going beyond fact checking and giving his personal opinions of the leaders? We've already had the anti-Corbyn piece from Pienaar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TocquevilleJnr Odd that Tories keep fielding Nikki Morgan when she isn't even standing in this election.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Heard anguished people on the radio: 'I don't know who to vote for, Labour's too far left, the Tories too far right.' It's not all about you.

<|startoftext|>No mention of the other interview Johnson has ducked.

<|startoftext|>@linnetdoonan The fact they allowed Neil to do that shows how worried they must be by all the criticism they've been getting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealSueKelly Yes, even the presumably live continuity announcer said that. Reports are that the interview will be replaced by a profile of Johnson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redflag3rd No. Those are over now. This was an interview on his own.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@crapshitmierda He wouldn't need a heads up to know those would be the questions. Which is why he's most unlikely to do it. If he's scared of Etchingham he's not likely to face Neil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wasn't expecting that from Andrew Neil! The BBC will have to put their tin hats on. #andrewneilinterviews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Can anything stop the Tories now?" asks the #itvnews presenter and of course the lickspittle Paul Brand doesn't think so saying they've come through the TV debates unscathed and forgetting to mention Johnson has pulled out of his own channel's interview tomorrow. @itvnews<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>LBC's Political EditorTheo Usherwood says the clapped-out New Statesman is "the Labour Bible". Even in its heyday it was never that. #LBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bobrurl Don't be silly. They'd do it for contrast with Corbyn because Johnson would say they not only watch it but stand to attention and salute.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's an awkward one for the media. If they try to give fuel to this nonsense by asking Johnson if he watches the Queen's Speech with his family they'd have to clarify which family?......and which children?......and how many children there are?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see another silly, confected story has started over Corbyn not watching the Queen's Speech (Christmas broadcast), unlike every other loyal subject.

<|startoftext|>@moodynews101 "It is unclear what role, if any, Cummings will play if Johnson is returned to Downing Street after the election" -Guardian. What he's doing now is anyone's guess but I bet it isn't pretty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's emerged tonight that Dom Cummings resigned from his No 10 post back on 6th November. But nobody knew until now. Classic Dom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusiePeaceCora There's a simple answer if Johnson refuses to do the Neil interview: the BBC just repeat the one Eddie Mair did with Johnson a few years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stewartbrown4 @HamieJones @SkyNews I watched the news conference live. Her question on anti-semitism was allowed and Corbyn gave a very full answer. Her report on ITV News didn't show this and was very misleading.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LibbyWienerITV Why did you imply your question on anti-semitism had been rejected and not answered when, as you well know, Corbyn gave a long and full answer on the subject? This was disgracefully misleading. @itvNews @Ofcom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"The broadcaster [BBC] clarified earlier today that it had not secured an agreement with the Prime Minister for him to take part in its series of interviews with party leaders, as many had expected he would." (via Guardian) #andrewneilinterviews #GE2019 #VoteLabour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anubeon Or Neil will go down with Laryngitis and will be replaced by Matt Baker.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Disgraceful that Libby Wiener's report was edited to suggest that at today's press conference on #NHS her question on anti-semitism was disallowed when in fact Corbyn gave a very full answer on the subject. #itvnews @itvnews @Ofcom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scaggs98091947 In fact he has been tweeting today and says it's his normal Wednesday show on BBC2 tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MsMariamR @melaniekmelvin Yes, looks like it. But some confusion over whether it's a new programme or a repeat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LBC's Theo Usherwood says a 'very senior BBC journalist' told him there was never any agreement for Johnson to do an Andrew Neil interview. So did the BBC lie to @UKLabour about that? And if Johnson doesn't do one they should just show a shot of an empty chair for 30 minutes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Update: It's been moved to BBC2 at 7pm. The BBC website doesn't say who he's interviewing. I assume one of the small parties if it's been shunted to BBC2. It's all a scheduling mess though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MagpiesView @sharpeleven His 'oven-ready' claim is about the Withdrawal Agreement. He doesn't want the public to even be aware there's a much more difficult deal to do after that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tonight's BBC Andrew Neil interview has been cancelled. It was still in the schedule this morning. Could it be this was the one pencilled in for Boris Johnson? #andrewneilinterviews #GE2019 #BBCNews @BBCNews @BBCPolitics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love the expression on the nurse sitting next to Johnson. Decidedly unimpressed and biting her tongue. #GE2019 #NHSNotforSale<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cactuscounty Not just journos. According to Guardian a link to the documents has been on the Reddit website for about a month but nobody paid much attention to it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Norman Smith doing his best to present the leaked documents as a 'scare tactic'. But here's the thing: if the #NHS and drug prices &amp; patents are a no-go area for the UK Government why would they even spend 6 meetings with the US discussing them? #NotForSale #BBCNews #GE2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Corbyn gave a long and good answer on anti-semitism at this morning's press conference. Why aren't #PoliticsLive playing that instead of making a silly attack on Barry Gardiner? @BBCPolitics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's Katy Balls in the Spectator chair today......the BBC house magazine.......and she's asked to comment on an interview last night by the Chairman of the Spectator, Andrew Neil. See how incestuous it all is? #PoliticsLive @BBCPolitics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michele_paule They were handed out to journalists for the first time during the press conference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sturgess_steve @BBCNormanS Missed that but heard his totally impartial "time is running out for Labour" on #r4today this morning. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kuenssberg was on Twitter rubbishing the significance of Labour's leaked Govt documents long before she could have read 400+ pages.......unless she's such a fast speed reader she could go on Britain's Got Talent as a speciality act. #NHS #NotForSale #BBCNews #LBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Labour HQ had to correct Adam Boulton who had implied Labour had dressed people up as doctors and nurses at their #NHS conference........they were actual doctors and nurses. You need to watch our biased media like a hawk. #skynews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At a press conference just now on the NHS Corbyn made a very strong statement on anti-semitism and pointed out that many Jews support the Labour Party. It helped that he wasn't being interrupted every few seconds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>James O'Brien, not for the first time, is conducting a phone-in on a programme he didn't watch* - the Neil/Corbyn interview. The weird thing is that he doesn't think there's anything strange about that. *Says he was out last night. Someone should tell him about iPlayer. #LBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shillcock_paul @campbell582000 If they were sure that option would be the least damaging then possibly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@suey2y @AmandaRamsay You can argue it both ways. The other theory is that a few days before polling people's opinions have already solidified. I don't know which is correct.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently the Tories haven't yet confirmed when Johnson will do the Andrew Neil interview. My guess is that: 1. They'll do it as late in the campaign as possible. 2. Try to arrange another big story that will minimise its impact. #andrewneilinterviews #r4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I often wonder what today's media would have done to this quiet, self-effacing man who gave us the #NHS and welfare state. Even back then Churchill and the Tory press claimed he would bring in a 'socialist Gestapo'. #Attlee #GE2019 #r4today #BBCNews #VoteLabour2019  https://t.co/OLCvBqWdsg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bobbidog Robinson was like one of those small yapping dogs. Unusually for me I turned it off after a couple of minutes. Not good for anyone's mental health first thing in the morning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichardKBarrett Johnson will try to talk all over him as he did last time and to some extent that tactic succeeded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichardKBarrett I don't want him to humiliate anyone, not even Johnson. It's a style of interviewing that wouldn't be tolerated in any other context, except possibly a police station.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EllyDavis @mrjamesob I said someone left-wing. When O'Brien interviews a Tory he fawns all over them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's an idea: just for balance, if Corbyn is being interviewed by the Chairman of a right-wing magazine, the Spectator, let's see Johnson interviewed by someone from a left-wing publication or website. #andrewneilinterviews #BBCelection<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@valtrnr @BBCNews @bbcpress It was recorded earlier in the day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tax on high earners has always been one of Andrew Neil's hobby horses. Him being a multi-millionaire is entirely coincidental. #andrewneilinterviews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of many stories kicked into touch today by the anti-semitism stuff is Michel Barnier confirming that Johnson's claim a trade deal can be done by end of 2020 is just fantasy. #GE2019 #BBCNews #itvnews @BBCNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pacelli1958 I've read that they now also call mobiles but I've no idea about the detail of how that works. Of course some polls are entirely online. But I doubt they've overcome the problem of reaching enough young people (or even oldies: I never answer numbers I don't recognise).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She's now corrected it and apologies to Fiona. It wasn't her, it was Sophie Raworth. I'm sitting with my back to the TV and they all sound the same! üòÑ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fleurbyfleur The BBC Politics Twitter account said an hour ago that it's at 7pm so I think it's Fiona Bruce who has cocked up. #BBCNews very accident prone at the moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martinjhamer @BBCNews @bbcpress Which programme are they sacrificing? One Show or Eastenders? The latter probably has more viewers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fiona Bruce says tonight's Andrew Neil interview with Corbyn is at 7.30. BBC website says it's at 7.00. I'm confused! #BBCNews @BBCNews @BBCPress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#LBC Political Editor has pointed out that in the latest Kantar poll if you strip out weighting for likelihood to vote the Tory lead is only 1 point. It shows a difference from past turnout patterns could have a significant effect. #GE2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Coburn crossed even more lines than usual today and the programme generally was even more unbalanced than usual. #PoliticsLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidagoodland @AlecHitchman1 @BBCr4today Strongly agree. Oddly enough a few weeks ago on here a Rabbi accused me of betraying the 'gay community' by supporting Corbyn! Also called me an anti-semite without any evidence. That's the lunacy that's enveloped us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is Coburn asking questions or just ranting? To be fair that was expected today. #PoliticsLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PoliticsLive @BBCPolitics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PoliticsLive @BBCPolitics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MccarthChase Me too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting that in the third quarter @UKLabour received donations of ¬£5.5M, nearly as much as the Conservatives. Much of it will have come from small individual donations and certainly not from hedge funds and corporate tax avoiders. #GE2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MomentumGrr They're still at it but in a more restrained and subtle way, telling Catholics to think about issues like abortion and homosexuality when voting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#r4today @BBCr4today #BBCNews @BBCNews #LBC #ChiefRabbi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Value_added @BBCr4today I certainly haven't noticed anyone from the more liberal wing of Judaism doing Thought for the Day recently, which they often used to. (To be fair, my brain often filters that segment out).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well knock me down with an embroidered hassock! Boris Johnson's fellow Old Etonian the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has rowed in behind the Chief Rabbi. #r4today #BBCNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#r4today @BBCr4today #ChiefRabbi #BBCNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Robinson says the Chief Rabbi's community is 'the Jewish Community'. So there's a single 'Jewish Community' is there? All represented by the Chief Rabbi? I suggest such an assertion is in itself anti-semitic and breaches the IHRA definition of anti-semitism. #r4today @BBCr4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haven't heard this important point made on the BBC this morning. Probably just an oversight. #r4today @BBCr4today  #BBCNews @BBCNews #ChiefRabbi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#r4today @BBCr4today #BBCNews @BBCNews #ChiefRabbi  https://t.co/S4f0kiVSIk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did Robinson just address Lord Heseltine as 'Michael'? I've never heard him address Labour or politicians of other parties by their first name. #r4today @BBCr4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the most prominent Jews in public life takes a very different view from the Chief Rabbi. #r4today #BBCNews @BBCNews @BBCr4today  https://t.co/TjbpLZMDYb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkJDoran Yes, I mentioned that on here a long time ago. It's another thing I have in common with Corbyn. The 9th blew me away when I was about 14 and I've loved it ever since.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good news that #C4News are going ahead with their postponed Climate Debate on Thursday and will now 'empty chair' Boris Johnson if he doesn't turn up. @Channel4News #GE2019<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>FWIW: New ICM national poll tonight has Labour closing the gap to 7 points. Another Wales-only poll has Labour up by 9 points in Wales.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good old Stormzy! Despite being so far from his target demographic I could be living on a planet of Alpha Centauri I actually enjoyed his set at Glastonbury this year (on TV; I wasn't camping in a field in any sense of the word). #GE2019 #Stormzy  https://t.co/5te4xWPbEz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gildy55 @chunkymark @Corbyn4No10 I'm listening to #bbcpm for the first time in ages because ex-Tory staffer Tom Swarbrick is sitting in for Eddie Mair on #LBC. What a mind-numbingly boring show it is now. And annoying, trilling posh woman Becky Milligan is doing a vox pop. ü§¨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just caught up with the clip of Nicky Morgan on #goodmorningbritain. Noticeable that the presenters did a much better job of exposing the fake 50,000 new nurses claim with her than Jo Coburn did with Brandon Lewis on BBC #PoliticsLive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had to go to the comments to find out this was a Tory candidate, something BBC man Dino Sofos didn't mention.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Usual change of tone from Coburn when a Labour politician comes on. Much more aggressive and hectoring. #PoliticsLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A lot of nonsense being talked about people laughing at politicians by those too young to remember the rowdy Town Hall meetings addressed by senior politicians that I attended when I was young. #PoliticsLive @BBCPolitics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've given up on explaining that but I wish you luck!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stebrown8 @BBCr4today Cummings has had Rees-Mogg confined to the downstairs servants' quarters at his Somerset home, locked inside a Sedan Chair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@desperate1949 No, he's been extremely unhelpful, although that rather depends on how much credibility/influence Blair still has.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those of us of Catholic parentage were taken to a separate room to say Catholic prayers then allowed into the back of the Assembly when they'd finished their Protestant prayers &amp; hymns. Great way to unite the school community! [State secondary, 50 years ago].<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blair is going to make his first intervention in the election today, seemingly focusing on Brexit. Will be interesting to see if there's any praise for Labour's manifesto. After all it was Blair who famously said "We're at our best when at our boldest." #GE2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was expecting Tory Manifesto to be at the top of the #BBCNews web page this morning but they've put it down "below the fold" (as we techies say), even further down on my phone where I had to scroll for miles. Coincidentally the Tories wanted a low profile for their manifesto.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Strange that Tories have put up Nicky Morgan who not only isn't a senior Cabinet member but isn't standing again at this election. She's already doing the cop-out 'social care isn't my subject area'. #r4today @BBCr4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is that it?  #ConservativeManifesto #ToryManifesto<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hepworthclare You seem as worryingly familiar with the procedure as I am Clare. üòÑ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When there's a shot of the audience at the #ConservativeManifesto launch you see a collection of people that seems to have been selected to be as unrepresentative as possible of contemporary Britain. #ToryManifesto #BBCNews #GE2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today Johnson says his deal is not just 'oven-ready' but 'pre-cooked'. So it's like one of those unhealthy supermarket convenience meals.  And if it's pre-cooked maybe that's confirmation that he's mainly just reheating May's deal. #ConservativeManifesto<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ConservativeManifesto #GE2019 #BBCNews #Skynews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reminds me of how some people mocked Gordon Brown for his quite severe visual impairment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FYI: #ConservativeManifesto launch is at 1.45 in Telford. Live on news channels. Hundreds already gathered outside the venue singing "Oh, Boris Johnson". (I made the last bit up).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#ConservativeManifesto #Ridge #GE2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Extraordinary that for their manifesto launch the Tories have personalised their election pledges around serial liar Boris Johnson with posters saying 'My Guarantee' and bearing the signature of the mendacious charlatan himself. #ConservativeManifesto #GE2019 #BBCNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frescos4U Ha ha. I'll take my chances. The worst Iain Dale has ever done to me is call me a twat on Twitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Iain Dale keeps saying Labour are abolishing the single person's Council Tax discount. This is not in Labour's manifesto nor their Grey Book of costings. I think he's using a Daily Express scare story written ahead of the manifesto. #LBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting that Gove mentions Tory PM Stanley Baldwin. It was during the Tory Government of Baldwin that my late mother was collecting donations for what today we call Foodbanks. Some things don't change. #Marr  https://t.co/nPwhAtl27O<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those of us longer in the tooth than we might wish to be also remember Tories at previous elections pledging no increase in VAT.........and then increasing VAT. #Marr #NeverTrustATory #GE2019 #VoteLabour2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Poor Jo Swinson. It was "difficult to be in Government". Not nearly as difficult as it was for those on the receiving end of the cruel and vicious policies she supported. #Marr #GE2019 #NeverTrustALibDem #VoteLabour2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bucketoftea No need for that. Blocking you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Angela Rayner not doing herself or the party any favours by refusing to answer a simple question. #Marr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So do we all agree with Andrew #Marr that Jeremy Clarkson changing his mind on something is a "Big Cultural Moment"? Or are we shouting at the telly "For God's sake, get a fucking grip!".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last time the Tories made a promise on the Winter Fuel Payment they then promptly cut it for the oldest, most vulnerable age group by a whacking ¬£100 a year. #Marr #Ridge #GE2019 #NeverTrustATory #VoteLabour2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrissieGrech @BorisJohnson I've looked at all these photos on Twitter this morning but I can't see an earpiece in Johnson's ear. Do I need to go to Specsavers or are people over-reaching themselves with their conspiracy theories?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gillyr68 I read it applies to anyone with a Blue Badge. Does the Tories' generosity know no bounds?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tories to abolish hospital car parking charges. Hooray! Oh hang on. It's only for some categories of patients and visitors, not for everyone. That sounds like an expensive, bureaucratic nightmare. But who cares so long as it generates some misleading headlines. #BBCNews #Marr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@linholden I quite like cold corned beef but cooked corned beef makes me feel sick so I'd have to use something else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@linholden If you say so.....*heads to Google*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@morrispexmouth Ah thanks. I'd call it a vest too. I've certainly never worn anything like that, not even in my clubbing days. I'd look like Onslow in Keeping Up Appearances.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@morrispexmouth No. Not #<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Greenfleeves Go on. Think of it as a dress rehearsal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@morrispexmouth Don't laugh but I'm not even sure of the definition. At this time of the year I often wear sleeveless pullovers. Are they the same thing as a tank top? At my age I don't want neighbours shouting 'bum boy' at me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Whitmore03David No, chilled and straight from the can. With chopped apple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanLabour @Hepworthclare There were indeed splits and in a reversal of today's position most of his party were pro-Leave. He didn't actually remain neutral but he kept a low profile in the campaign and allowed Ministers and MPs to campaign for either side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm having to dine on corned beef tonight because one of my stockpile of cans for a No Deal Brexit/Nuclear Winter/Unspecified Apocalypse was close to its Use By Date. üôÅ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Corbyn's position on a 2nd referendum is not so dissimilar from Harold Wilson's in 1975: he was pro-Remain but "during the referendum campaign he held himself aloof.......by avoiding passion in his own advocacy he hoped to keep the temperature low." [Ben Pimlott's biography].<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fresh from her triumph on the #BBCQTDebate Swinson is on #Marr in the morning. That's going to feel like a rest cure after Friday night's onslaught.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Teresa_Peckham Yes, he let him get away with the old nonsense about Labour spending causing the global financial crisis without even a murmur of challenge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Matt Frei tells a caller "Fiona Bruce isn't here to defend herself." If that principle is going to apply then most phone-ins will be impossible. #LBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, I tweeted that at the time. It should have attracted more attention than it has. #bbcqt #BBCQTDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boris Johnson has been talking about a "dementia moonshot". Is he planning to solve the social care crisis by sending people with dementia to the moon? üò≤ #GE2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's more support for Corbyn's position on a 2nd referendum on this phone-in than I was expecting. But I fear the person vetting the calls this morning may be out of a job by next week. #LBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MogridgeSteve @bushmanB25 It's a myth that they did that last time. The timestamp on the page related to the time they set up the template in readiness for uploading the result of the poll.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bushmanB25 Maybe YouGov staff have already moved to a 4-day week? üòÄ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Isobel_waby I think Swinson might well have walked off to silence or near-silence if Fiona Bruce hadn't encouraged the audience to applaud. It doesn't get worse than that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlecHitchman1 Fiona Bruce also had some bizarre pantomime moments, turning to the audience and asking "Are we still full of energy?"  She'd have been a good presenter of Crackerjack. #bbcqt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't believe Swinson actually tweeted that before the debate. That's Hubris with a capital H.......and in flashing neon letters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd always assumed blood was gender-neutral. Do doctors really need to know your biological sex as well as your blood group before giving a transfusion? #r4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mail, Express, Sun.......none of them has last night's debate on their front page (unless they did later editions, which is unlikely because the debate ended at 9pm). If Cobyn had bombed and Johnson triumphed I doubt that would have been the case. #r4today #bbcqt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@90percenters It's a line that all broadcasters have been pushing recently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the Spectator muppets - James Forsyth - has already blamed the audience, saying they were 'skewed to the left'. #bbcqt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaneG8992 @bbclaurak Laura seems to be having a night off. Unless she was too upset by Johnson's dismal performance to go on air.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The clips in Pienaar's report for BBC News gave no indication of the amount of support for Corbyn from the audience, a level of support that frankly surprised me, and twice Pienaar said Johnson would be pleased and content with his (shambolic) performance. #bbcqt #BBCNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealSueKelly @jeremycorbyn @NicolaSturgeon @joswinson @BorisJohnson A good summary. Worth every penny. üòÑ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you think anyone will have the nerve to tell us that Johnson won this one? #bbcqt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's where she learnt to interrogate people! üòÑ #bbcqt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martinjhamer That dates us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JA_Onion_Bhajis I think I've got it! She played a policewoman in Coronation Street.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Swinson is wearing very high heels. It would be awful if she did an Ed Miliband and tripped on her way out. ü§≠ #bbcqt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JA_Onion_Bhajis I know. It's doing my head in. I thought she was a politician but others think she was an actress.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can't fault this from Swinson: "We are here. It is November. We are still members of the EU." That aside, she's dying on her arse. #bbcqt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting qualified answer from Swinson that she wouldn't go into coalition with the Tories *while Boris Johnson is leader*. #bbcqt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where do I know that last questioner from? The lady who asked Swinson about her record in Government? #bbcqt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because of this #bbcqt Election Special tonight's Would I Lie To You has been cancelled. There's a joke in there but it's too obvious even for me to do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martinjhamer @golwgymor Because I don't watch the normal #bbcqt for health reasons I hadn't realised just how dreadful Fiona Bruce is. She needs to wind her neck in and leave the questioning to the audience. I thought that was the point of the programme.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just like the Dimbleby brothers Fiona Bruce doesn't understand the role of a moderator is not to ask their own questions and pursue their own agenda. #bbcqt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two questions to Corbyn never got answered because Fiona Bruce jumped in with a question of her own about the IFS. #bbcqt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That will be why Jon Pienaar did his live piece from the venue on the BBC News at Six well out of earshot of the huge crowd of Corbyn supporters. üòÑ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@90percenters The other stand-out moment in the 2017 programme was May admonishing that nurse and telling her there was no magic money tree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My chief memory of the 2017 #bbcqt Election Special is the man haranguing Corbyn for not wishing to annihilate millions in a nuclear strike. And in 2015 Miliband tripping as he left the stage and the BBC director instantly cutting to some people laughing at him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matwatkinson I've just discovered he's someone I'd blocked on Twitter for stupidity. His now notorious asininity on #bbcqt seems to have justified my action.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Controversial thought: If MPs have to declare an interest when speaking in the Commons why not broadcasters when discussing issues? Jo Coburn was privately educated. #PoliticsLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Infallibility used to be attributed only to the Pope. But today it seems to be attributed to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. ü§î #PoliticsLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We can enrol this guy as one of the heroes of the #GE2019. Notice how when he tackles Swinson about #LibDems' role in austerity she and the bloke with her try to change the subject.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Research is shown that when it comes to income people have a tendency to compare themselves only to those earning more than themselves. That's why you get comfortably off people, even those in top 5%, thinking they're as poor as church mice. #LBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomWoodstock1 @BBCr4today @bbcnickrobinson @sarahsands100 @BBCPolitics @BBCNews Excellent. I've no doubt that Capita will bat it away in the first instance so it may be a long haul.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only the other day Jeremy Corbyn was talking about the abuses of human rights in Russia, of which attacks on #LGTB people are a part. But of course that doesn't fit easily with the Tory &amp; media narrative of Corbyn being an apologist for the Russian regime. #r4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And why did Robinson, a so-called senior journalist, spout the lie that Labour's Corporation Tax would be the highest in the world? He really should check the veracity of Tory attack lines before repeating them on air. #r4today @BBCr4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Robinson banging the anti-union drum. I doubt people going to foodbanks or unable to get social care or struggling to get a GP appointment are worrying about secondary picketing. #r4today @BBCr4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Given the size of the BBC payroll why on earth is #r4today working with Tortoise, a new news outfit set up by former BBC Head of News James Harding, and paying one of their people, another former BBC man, to read 'essays' on the election?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Farage tells ITV that yesterday a group of people protesting against Corbyn over anti-semitism came over and asked for selfies with him. Sounds like those people were very selective in their anti-racism. #itvtonight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just a reminder amidst all the hysteria that for most of Thatcher's time in office the top rate of income tax was higher (at 60%) than what Labour is proposing today. #LabourManifesto #BBCNews #GE2019 #VoteLabour üåπ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mybrownmac As I'm in quote mode today, I think it was Bob Marley who said "some people are so poor all they have is money".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaryKapadia I have a surname that can be pronounced two different ways. If I took offence every time someone said it differently from me I'd be in a near permanent rage. But does annoy me when people correct my own pronunciation of my own name!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Makes me laugh when people say the extremely wealthy "have worked hard for their money" as though that's justification of obscene wealth. Plenty of people work hard: nurses, people in warehouses, those forced to do two jobs. And many are rich from inherited wealth not hard work.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BlackBob1952 That's how I pronounced it and I think most people did at the time. @MichaelRosenYes who is a great authority on language says there's no right or wrong way.....unless I suppose you're in the grip of some political agenda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bernardshawlive @BBCNews @IanJWatson You've got the wrong Iain Watson there.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Powerful lines from Corbyn on voting for the interests of people you don't even know....those struggling in poverty, those sleeping on the streets....but sadly too many people are too selfish to do so, perhaps an enduring legacy of Thatcherism. #LabourManifesto<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It wasn't Javid who called for an inquiry into Islamophobia in the Tory Party, as Husain says. It was Rory Stewart. What's happened to Rory by the way?

<|startoftext|>@msloobylou A lot comes from the vast amounts of land and property that the monarchy owns, including Duchies of Cornwall and Lancaster. You could argue they shouldn't own it but no doubt that would make you a communist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@msloobylou One version I heard was that his ¬£250k salary is paid by the Queen from the Duchy of Lancaster but costs associated with public duties are paid from the Civil List. Presumably some public costs like security (amount never revealed) will continue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nick Witchell yesterday; 'Prince Andrew gets no public money, he's paid by the Queen.' BBC royal correspondent this morning: 'ending of his subsidy from the public purse'. Please make sure you're singing from the same hymn sheet! #r4today #BBCNews @BBCNews<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jacjc4pm19 @wilde I heard this on Eddie Mair show on #LBC. Haven't yet seen it on any of tonight's TV news programmes. May have been on Sky; haven't watched that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the #itvnews vox pop tonight in Peterborough, where 10,484 people voted Labour in this year's by-election which Labour won, they couldn't find a single Labour voter. Mind you, they visited only one workplace so they didn't over-exert themselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In his interview with #itvnews Johnson described the rise in the National Insurance threshold to ¬£12,500 as simultaneously an immediate change and just a future ambition. The sad thing is that there are people who believe his bullshit. #GE2019 #VoteLabour2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just when you thought you couldn't hate Dominic Raab any more you learn he's threatening Harry Dunn's parents with having to pay his own legal costs which could lead to them losing their homes. #CurseDominicRaab  https://t.co/qjtY50yDnJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A horrible, ear-torturing noise was emanating from downstairs and I thought one of my fire alarms had malfunctioned. But it turned out I'd left the radio on in the kitchen and it was Swinson launching the #LibDem manifesto.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Great to hear Alexei Sayle on #r4today. It's not enough for a comedian to be political and Alexei, now at the peak of his powers, is also very funny. So many great lines in his recent #R4 series, lines that any writer would be proud to have written.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MHarris360 The Electoral Commission should have the power to fine a party for such an egregious level of deception. #FullFactuk #r4today #BBCNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Justin Webb's lame attempt to defend the Tories' Twitter deception relied on everyone knowing what 'CCHQ' stands for, which they certainly wouldn't. The word 'Conservatives' didn't appear on the tweets. #r4today @BBCr4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you thought the Tory Twitter account was run by 10 year olds here's proof the LibDem Twitter account is run by 5 year olds. Embarrassing stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's been mentioned in #wakeuptomoney on #5live where amazingly they employ a dinosaur presenter, Mickey Clark, who isn't on Twitter and doesn't know how it works.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In YouGov poll, for what it's worth which may not be much, Corbyn regarded as more trustworthy, more in touch with ordinary people (massively so), and better on the #NHS - despite Johnson infesting dozens of hospitals in recent weeks. #ITVDebate #LeadersDebate #GE2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see the more honest journos have recognised that based on all the other polling we've seen in recent weeks that debate should have been a massive win for Johnson. That it wasn't will surely worry the Tories. #ITVDebate #LeadersDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tingletoot68 @forumeditor @TGFMichaelRosen Etchingham was very cocksure about her chairing abilities on #r4today this morning but I thought she was quite poor and on occasions not impartial. #ITVDebate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If YouGov snap poll has it pretty much a draw that must mean it was a clear win for Corbyn. #ITVDebate #LeadersDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brilliant typo from Guardian's live blog on #LeadersDebate: "When Etchingham insists on a non-political gift, he [Johnson] says a pot of damsel jam." üòÇ #ITVDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DWPscumbags Please God no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Q: Does the truth matter in this election?  Johnson replies: I think it does. The audience laugh. #LeadersDebate #ITVDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My God, that was a naff piece of theatre by Julie Etchingham, making Corbyn and Johnson shake hands. #LeadersDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#LeadersDebate #GE2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well done all those people in Salford who turned out tonight to give Jeremy Corbyn a warm welcome to the ITV studios for the #LeadersDebate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gildy55 They're at a time when I'm either listening to R4Extra or sound asleep......fortunately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If this is true and if Corbyn is at that debate then it's a very bad mistake by the Tories. Remember how the other parties made hay when May sent Rudd in her place to a debate in 2017. #GE2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In case you missed it in the focus on #LeadersDebate, BBC1 has a Question Time with Nigel Farage at 10.45 tonight. Not sure if it's for the election or a Special to celebrate him having been on #bbcqt more times than anyone else. #GE2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting to see how personal Johnson gets tonight in the #LeadersDebate. Even if he's advised to rein in the playground insults and be more statesmanlike I'm not sure he's capable of doing so. He'll probably make the studio audience laugh. People at home are another matter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomJLines It's also a way to lose weight: halving your bread intake without noticing it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have an anti-Corbyn threesome on the panel today . What a surprise! Just as well we're not in an election campaign. Oh, hang on...... #PoliticsLive @BBCPolitics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sturgess_steve Indeed. The only sandwich story I've ever seen about Corbyn is his readiness to share his sandwiches with other people on trains.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaggieB09379854 Like a 'Club Sandwich'? I always thought them impractical and difficult to eat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't think wanting to be extremely wealthy is a childhood ambition to be admired. #r4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cancelling a theoretical tax cut is not the same thing as a 'tax rise'. But when you're spinning for the Tories like Nick Robinson you're prepared to spout any old nonsense on the 'flagship news programme'. #r4today @BBCr4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BBCNews @BBCNews #r4today #GE2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matwatkinson There are plenty of other decent academic psephologists but they rarely get a look-in. It's similar to the way Simon Calder is the only Travel Editor you ever see or hear on the BBC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sharpeleven Unfunny and embarrassingly needy Matt Forde was on the most recent BBC Electioncast which I quickly switched off. What is it about this Corbyn-hating so-called comedian that the media love so much? ü§î<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Whaler180Darts Who are you calling a tart? ....oh, I see what you mean.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm eating open sandwiches which are probably a lefty, unpatriotic, continental crime against British gastronomy. But am I bothered? It does raise the question of whether an open sandwich is even a sandwich, but it's not the most pressing question of the day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope every so-called journalist in the country reads this piece. Many of us on social media call out Johnson's unceasing stream of lies but our reach is very limited. #GE2019 #BBCNews @BBCNews #itvnews #skynews  https://t.co/HkN0Q79w7K<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scoutsteve1 It's very unlikely the party of the workers would do anything that would rob BT workers, many of them union members, of their pensions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scoutsteve1 You'll see it a lot quicker than the Tory one. But I don't think there should have been any TV debates before manifestos have been published.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charmaine725 Oh I agree. As I said yesterday teeth and eyes should never have been separated off from the free-at-point-of-use principle. Opticians are a bugbear of mine. Last week one tried to sell me new glasses I didn't need, as they eventually conceded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the choices at the election: do people want an 'entertainer' or someone on top of the detail? #GE2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SunilChodha So obvious that I nearly didn't tweet it in case it was me being stupid (wouldn't have been the first time!).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surely postponing the Corporation Tax cut doesn't "raise ¬£6 Billion" as the BBC Reality Check man says? It stops you losing ¬£6 Billion from the tax take. If you want to raise extra billions you need the Labour policy of raising Corporation Tax. #BBCNews @BBCNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charmaine725 It's entirely free on some income-related benefits and also if your UC payment is below a certain level but it's a complex and irrational hotch-potch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angela_vince Yes I saw that. Foreign affairs is his specialist subject. Former Foreign Secretary Johnson with his legendary indifference to detail would struggle against him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NovaArmada92 @UKLabour So a lying headline is fine so long as it's a Labour one. I think that's known as stupid tribalism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Corbyn often at his best when answering questions after his speeches, e.g., his fluent response here on bus services, showing an impressive grasp of detail and drawing on his long Parliamentary experience. #CBI2019 #BBCNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BBC Business Editor asks Corbyn if he agrees that he's "sending a chill through boardrooms", which sounds curiously like a bog standard Tory attack line. #BBCNews #CBI2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZoekGtto @UKLabour It's still important because the check-up can identify oral cancers and neck lumps. But it's a first step rather than a complete solution.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NovaArmada92 @UKLabour The headline is inaccurate. Why are you defending it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At the CBI Corbyn follows Johnson and calls Johnson his warm-up act. It gets a good laugh. #CBI2019 #BBCNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll also call out my own party when they get it wrong. Labour has put a video on Facebook with the headline "We'll scrap dental charges". Whilst the accompanying video says that's only for check-ups &amp; Band 1 treatment the headline is misleading. @UKLabour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Johnson saying again that a trade deal will be easy because we're already aligned with the #EU.  But I thought that Tory policy was to de-align from the EU so there will be lots of unpicking to negotiate? #CBI #Brexit #BBCNews #GE2019 #VoteLabour2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A classic example of bias by omission. But not surprising when you look at who wrote it: Jon Pienaar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My beef with John Curtice is that he knows that polls today are not predictive of what will happen on 12th December but he talks as though they were. But I suppose that's why he gets so many lucrative media gigs....and a knighthood. #r4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Webb: I'm entitled to talk all over you because we're running out of time. Amazing how often a 3 hour programme 'runs out of time'. Maybe they should engage some time-management consultants. #r4today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@msloobylou He's in an ordinary white shirt. I think you've muddled up your morons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Andrew Maxwell is someone I always quickly switch off on R4 and R4Extra. Not just unfunny but horrendously loud with it. #ImACeleb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least Prince Andrew was a gift to comedy writers. His alleged inability to sweat made it into the first two minutes of Ant &amp; Dec's script on #ImACeleb.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why was Labour's Jon Ashworth visiting a dental surgery "slightly surreal"? Was it any more surreal than Johnson daily bumbling round hospital wards or sitting awkwardly in infant school classes? #C4News @Channel4News<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@freddiesgranny @soxgnasher This thread is a bit depressing for me because I've been cursed with bad teeth and I've enriched many dentists during my life. On the couch again on Wednesday, for at least the 6th time this year. üôÅ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gildy55 @HarryTrevor8888 Most fans will have seen the England match which is on now (but not captivating me, hence I'm on Twitter). I'll record the Acuri interview 'cos I go to bed at ten (!) and see if it's headlines on #r4today tomorrow. Be a hell of a shock if it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@forumeditor @Lovejoy999 I think that's a Band 1 treatment so would be free under Labour's policy. (Personally I'd pay ¬£50 not to have a clean and polish!).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@will789gb @GMB No chance of them replacing the launch of 'I'm A Celebrity You've Never Heard Of'. But will be interesting to see how much other broadcasters including the BBC report on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matwatkinson Astonishing ignorance around this, including by 'journalists' reporting on the subject. But we're used to that now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>11pm tonight on ITV1. A late change to the schedule. Replaces the football highlights.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JudiDoodlecat It's free for those on Income Support but they're a small proportion of those on benefits and an even smaller proportion of all those on low incomes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a bit misleading to say dentistry is free for those on low incomes. When I was surviving (or struggling to) on a sickness benefit I was surprised to find I still had to pay for dental treatment. #LBC #BBCNews #Marr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking at some Twitter comments, that very impressive, assured performance from Corbyn has certainly enraged his enemies who are no doubt terrified people will compare that with the bumbling, lying buffoon Johnson. #Marr #GE2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cornish_Damo Almost identical!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dominic Raab would be well advised not to smile at all rather than do that sickly, psycho smile that would be helpful only if he were auditioning for Hammer Films. #Marr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidagoodland @BlauesStrange Yes, that seems to be a new development. In the past year or so my dentist has started checking my neck for lumps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, I would have mentioned that too if I'd had room. Doubt media reporting of the Labour policy will mention such things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ItCorbyn They were both originally included. Bevan, along with Wilson and Freeman, resigned over the introduction of prescription charges.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Teeth and eyes should never have been hived off from the rest of free-at-point-of-use #NHS. Both have impact on wider health. Eye tests can indicate brain tumours and dental check-ups can identify oral cancers. Labour policy on teeth a good first step. #BBCNews #GE2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gildy55 That was on their religious magazine 'Sunday'. Michael Rosen has made the point that 50% of UK Jews don't go to synagogues so how do pollsters find a representative sample of UK Jews?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>'Can we even talk about immigration?' says @AndrewCastle63.......as he conducts a phone-in on immigration on national radio. We've talked about it constantly since I was a teenager over 50 years ago. Stop the 'we can't talk about it' nonsense! #LBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm still not clear about Prince Andrew's relationship with Epstein. If, as he says, they weren't particularly close friends why was severing contact with him such a big deal that he had to go to his house to tell him and spend four days there? #PrinceAndrew<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pthonyc @nigel_guisboro I'm always struck by the likeness.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TessAlps I could be wrong but for once I don't think Johnson was lying. I think he genuinely didn't know the % split between EU and rest of world immigration so made a wildly inaccurate guess. They've spent half of #PoliticsLive on it.* *They haven't. I made that up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Coburn says Johnson didn't know the words of 'the wheels on the bus'. I missed the beginning of #PoliticsLive. Did they mention he didn't know the immigration figures this morning? @BBCPolitics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why didn't #PoliticsLive play that clip of Ann Widdecombe to Tory spokesman Jake Berry instead of letting him get away with saying he had no knowledge of people being offered jobs? @BBCPolitics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scoutsteve1 @BBCr4today OK, but I can't get a reliable mobile signal inside my house so if I had the dongle I'd have to put my PC on an elevated platform at the bottom of my garden so, as things stand, it's impractical.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Newton-Dunn as astonished by this as I was. How is it possible that an old bloke like me tweeting in his living room knows more about migration figures than the Prime Minister? Let's see how much coverage it gets. #BBCYourQuestions #BBCNews #5live<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scoutsteve1 @BBCr4today If so, why are you the only person who knows that we can all already have free broadband via a 'usb dongle' and why has nobody told the Government that fibre broadband will be redundant before 2030?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Farage doesn't trust Johnson enough to give him a Commons majority yet totally believes his promise to complete a trade deal by end of 2020 or leave with no deal......rather inconsistent.

<|startoftext|>I don't expect all Labour people to like Corbyn just as many of us were not fans of Blair but when they tell people to vote Tory they're spitting in the faces of the homeless, the poor, those suffering under Universal Credit, those using foodbanks......#r4today<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>On @BBC5live BBC Home Editor Mark Easton says "There's no correlation between police numbers and the level of crime."

<|startoftext|>ITV's Paul Brand tonight did a tiny vox pop that was 100% anti-Corbyn and pro-Johnson ("best PM since Churchill" said woman in pub).

<|startoftext|>I like Rob Burley's 'excuse' that the production team had been working all night. Surely #BBCNews staff who do night shifts are allowed to sleep during the day? If not they need to join a union sharpish. #wreathgate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I've only just caught up properly with the BBC #Wreathgate story. I'd be more inclined to accept it was an error if the clip didn't suddenly cut in the middle from yesterday to a few years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the BBC is going to dig out archive video and audio of the party leaders it will be very interesting to see them do it for Johnson, especially when they play the audio of Johnson agreeing to help get someone beaten up.*  *Spoiler: they won't. #PoliticsLive @BBCPolitics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting that Farage isn't standing the Brexit Party in Tory seats because he believes serial liar Johnson's promises on Brexit.
