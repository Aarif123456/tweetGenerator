<|startoftext|>@GerardCollier6 I 100% believe Pence is being tapped for a 2024 run. He has that BS smooth talk that fits the pre-Trump GOP days. They’ll go for the prior package snake oil method but with the same agenda.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ClistonBrown Not to mention that they are already planning for their next run in 2024. They will dig up a candidate with all the clean cut looks and smooth talk of the GOP  before Trump. In other words, better delivery with the same actions. Don’t be fooled. #NeverAgain<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jeff_Jacoby @KamalaHarris I hope all the vitriol over this tweet stays intact when 2024 comes and the GOP has dug up and trotted out a candidate with the old school packaged look/talk for your vote.

<|startoftext|>@leeson_erica @scrawny_nelson @mmpadellan That’s great insight on his part because Trump is not the creator of this civil war but the leader for which the soldiers have been looking.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan So, it turns out America isn’t a democracy. Huh, well ain’t that a blip.....unless of course you’re not a straight white male then you damn well know it never has been.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Yea, I don’t know who took the controls but this is not Trump speaking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This isn’t Trump. Who is either giving him these words or tweeting for him? #ElectionResults2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LV_DH_1 Yea. That senate is gonna be an issue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very close to shutting it down<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Acosta Trump hasn’t rage tweeted in two hours. This should do it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@spdnyc @ellynmarsh As some one who lived periodically in Florida and lives every day as 1) a person of color and 2) a woman. I know. Can we start saying it out loud and acting like it’s true now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ellynmarsh Me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LV_DH_1 It’s a keep counting the votes and stay calm statement<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andreanorred @willwilkinson Exactly, Andrea. All these “I can’t believe anyone would vote for him” shocked people. WHERE HAVE YOU ALL BEEN LIVING?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KyungLahCNN @Acosta @dougducey I’d love the call to be for Biden but the orange animal and his people are right. It’s too early for calls to be made in the Presidential race.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Another Democrat in the Senate!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scottcrates Because there is a greedy, mysoginistic, racist center to this country not being addressed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LV_DH_1 @mmpadellan Thank you! If anyone else has recommendations please share.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@susanorlean Susan you’re in the exact same place you were in 2016. Nothing and no one has changed. Now perhaps the country will address what we are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeganKelleyHall @susanorlean Just now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZackBornstein @thekjohnston The fact that an impeached President put in measures to steal the election in plain view, threatened violence if he loses and is a loud and proud white supremest but nothing has come of legally removing him from office....yea. Okay, America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LV_DH_1 @mmpadellan I need to know so much more about this. I’ll be doing some research. I’m fascinated and would like to talk to more people.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LV_DH_1 @mmpadellan I was just talking topeople who are immigrants or family of immigrants and blown out of the water by the insight on immigrant on immigrant shame. In other words immigrants disliking other immigrants &amp; voting for Trump to support blocking immigration. Surely that’s not the norm.<|endoftext|>

Not even able to detail mess he has put into place just that’s is “the best”. So,everyone pull out their videos/clips of Trump at his worst and tweet #Thisiswhotrumpis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeTakei Everyone pull out your videos of the horrendous things Trump has done or said and Tweet the hell out of them tomorrow. This man never answered a question tonight or provided a single plan. EVER. Let’s remind everyone #thisiswhoTrumpis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@posessedspinach @YourAnonCentral @AOC Bottom line.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YourAnonCentral @AOC A detailed plan. He never gives a plan. Just we have this and that—no details on this and that. Then he shoots out misinformation on the 8 years of Obama/Biden. He is a trained deflector.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bakari_Sellers @CooperSBeckett At the end of this people are going to say Trump did well because of his ability to not storm out of the room. The bar of well done is low. EVERYONE PULL OUT YOUR FACT VIDEOS OF WHO TRUMP REALLY IS AND TWEET THEM ALL DAY TOMORROW #Thisiswhotrumpis<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Energy, excitement, outrage. This is the temperament I want in a President. A human who expresses these characteristics FOR THE COUNTRY HE SERVES. NOT.FOR.HIMSELF.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A desire for change, equality and conversation instead of disparity and anger. #hope #biden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is what I want to know. Because behind all the people working the regime are silent workers living pay check to paycheck. What about them?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So, let me get this straight. Trump told every governor to send everyone back to their work places and the kids back to school but his house is working from home? @WaterDean what do you think about that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s as simple as that. “I want to live”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mr Trump, this is what you knowingly did to the American people and will continue to do through killing immigrants, non whites and the poor. You and every politician who supported you must go. #SaveAmerica #VoteBidenHarris2020 #FlipTheSenateBlue<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GabbieKDrice They want him BECAUSE he is the embodiment of white male privilege.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LynnComella @CooperSBeckett @maddow I disagree that he is unwell. His behavior is a result of his beliefs and life choices.  I believe that calling those behaviors/choices symptomatic of a mental illness is more comfortable than accepting that this is the belief system of Trump and many Americans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebr0keb0i Oh I am right there with you. I don’t think I’ve ever screamed via Twitter so much in my life OR ran to see what other people were thinking just to make sure I wasn’t alone. #serenitynow<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LynnComella @CooperSBeckett @maddow I can see how it’s comfortable to call him mentally ill. It’s more comfortable to say he is ill than to say aloud that many Americans &amp; politicians around him agree with his way of thinking. he is a representation of racism,greed &amp; ideologies this country has held for centuries.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Has anyone caught on to the fact that 2020 has only confirmed what sensible people and journalists have been screaming since Trump began his 2016 campaign?
