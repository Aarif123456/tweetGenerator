<|startoftext|>@BrianKarem @BETO2020POTUS I‚Äôll help you. This is State run propaganda.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is the only right thing to do. Many countries give parents a year. We have been brain washed not to take all of our sick and vacation days along with parental leave. Don‚Äôt be fooled by corporate greed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Companies never make changes until it‚Äôs too late. Until someone is killed or raped. They don‚Äôt care unless it affects their bottom line. #BoycottLyft #BoycottUber @Uber @AskLyft @lyft<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Help me make #BoycottLyft and #BoycottUber a thing. Women and girls are being sexually harassed, verbally abused, and threatened in locked, speeding cars. This could be your wife, sister, mother, friend, or girlfriend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay I‚Äôm calling now for everyone to boycott @lyft @AskLyft and @Uber because of the hundreds of stories coming out recently of women being threatened while trapped in a speeding vehicle with doors locked. #BoycottLyft #BoycottUber<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ogpanda23 Yes that will definitely help! We talked about a show like this a year or so ago. It will be good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know I‚Äôm in the minority here, but I never burn out on #StarWars, and although I‚Äôm happy about the new content coming to #Disney+, I‚Äôm sad that we have to wait so long for new movies. Anyone else feel the same?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HamillHimself We stand together!  https://t.co/aX3oXgLDIW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you want to get rid of horrible people on your timeline and gain decent, empathetic, joyous people just start tweeting about how much of a lying, moronic, sexist, racist POS tRump is. In other words the truth. Works for me. üòä<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This will not stand. Republicans are out of touch with most of our country‚Äôs needs and desires. #BlueWave2020 #VoteBlueNoMatterWho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VillimeyS So for me it changes with each new project. Lots of Pixies for Bookworm, Hazel English for Advice For Teenage Outcasts, and Pixar soundtracks for my current project! Great question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mkraju So tRump actually does believe that Lincoln  lost. If we take a deeper dive what he‚Äôs saying is that slavery would be good for our country. Subconsciously or consciously this is what he meant by losing the war.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>During the writing of the original #StarWars George Lucas briefly turned Luke into a young woman much like Rey before bringing back Leia. Here are Ralph McQuarrie‚Äôs sketches and paintings. This is from a book I‚Äôm reading titled The Making of Star Wars.  https://t.co/OPfi7Jl6rZ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kellybarnhill We all need to take a photo of the Lyft or Uber driver‚Äôs car license and text it along with a photo of the app page with the driver‚Äôs name to a friend before getting into the car. Also, call someone and mention that you‚Äôre in their car.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Thank you @NYSenate for following the law.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is America, but it doesn‚Äôt have to be. We need to stand together to fight this kind of abuse. Speak out, vote, and keep using your cameras to hold them accountable.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HamillHimself True story. I wanted to name our son Anakin, but my wife wasn‚Äôt having it. She said ‚ÄúHe turns to the dark side‚Äù.  I said yes but Luke helps redeem him. She was like ‚Äúno‚Äù. I should have insisted on Luke. Or Mark. ü§£<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#FliptheSenateBlue if you want mass school and church shootings to stop. Vote for the survival of children, not for your political party. Vote with your conscience. #AmericansForImpeachment #BlueWave2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@joeroberts_1 @HamillHimself @Mendazoo Disney is giving us more great #StarWars. The Force Awakens was excellent, Rogue One was amazing, Solo was fun and underrated, we‚Äôre getting more Clone Wars, and now live action shows with people like Favreau &amp; Diego Luna involved.
