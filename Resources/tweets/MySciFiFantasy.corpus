<|startoftext|>@BethMooreLPM Amen!  Just because God sometimes uses unGodly men to His will, doesn't mean we should worship them.  You can support some of the things a man can do while in power to help your cause, but remember that He himself is just as sinful as everyone else.  Don't praise him. Praise HIM.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Zephyrpak How do you share this pic without sharing the recipe????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Y'all done pissed Misha off by disrespecting a show he obviously loves. He knows what the show is really about. He knows the characters. He knows Cas can have feelings &amp; Dean doesn't have to share them. The show isn't based on them. It's about brothers against evil in the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@campbelIbain The show isn't about homo-anything!  It's about brothers/best friends. It's about family. It's about good vs evil. Get over yourselves and find an actual show that does have gay love, because there are many, even on the CW, which represents very well. Leave the cast &amp; crew alone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you want fantasy, read fanfic. The show is the show. The characters are as they are. Stop trying to change them into something they aren't. This whole thing has seriously ruined the finale for many fans &amp; cast. Be thankful for what we were given! #SPNLove<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why are people pushing for a "destiel" thing that had never been. Fine, Cas declared his whatever kind of love, but Dean has only ever thought of him as a best friend &amp; brother.  People are bullying fans &amp; the network (which has multiple gay characters in their shows. (c) #Misha<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Cheesy_Grinner Aww bless you &lt;3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CCunfer The only thing I found odd was Dean getting over his best friend's "death" so quickly. Other than that, the fans got a finale that made sense to anyone who knew what the show was about, which was the two brothers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Biz_Smith @andrewdabb But the idea is to give the boys peace. For them to be able to stop fighting, and as long as they were on earth, they would have kept fighting. Think of the look Dean had at the very end when Sam joined him. He breathed a sigh of relief. They were together, in heaven, and free.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imonlyhereforme Honey, if you think this was the worst finale in tv history, you haven't watched much tv! lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AutumnInBuffalo @Bree8314 @cw_spn Because life isn't fair. You can fight and fight and fluke things still happen. 15 years ago Dean took Sam away from the life he wanted. 15 years later Dean made him promise he'd go on, keep living.  Sam did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AutumnInBuffalo @Bree8314 @cw_spn And Dean had a hunter's funeral done buy his brother. Just as it was with many others they had to say goodbye to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AutumnInBuffalo @Bree8314 @cw_spn This heaven has all the people the boys loved and lost in a peaceful safe environment!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CCunfer Just because you misinterpreted characters doesn't mean trashing a show that you supposedly "loved." SPN wasn't about Cas &amp; his supposed love for Dean no matter how bad you want it. Dean doesn't have to be bi for SPN to be good! Grow up &amp; learn to deal w/what doesn't go your way!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you @andrewdabb . Unlike others, I get what this finale was about. It began w/the brothers &amp;ended w/the brothers, and I appreciate you holding strong to that. Sam got the life Dean pulled him away from. It was a beautiful ending scene.  Be proud! #Supernatural #SPN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was what it was all about.  The two brothers together &amp; finally at peace. No worries.  No pressure.

<|startoftext|>@therealKripke @KansasBand Eric, thank you for giving us our boys.   "There'll be peace when you are done."

<|startoftext|>@sapphic_energy @cw_spn Sorry for your misinterpretation of the characters which obviously caused you to disagree with their ending.  But the finale was on point with them, and was about the brothers it began with. The rest of the characters were supporting. There's other shows with actual gay leads.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sonya_Day4 @bisamwinchester @cw_spn But life doesn't work like that and that is precisely what the show is about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FangirlingPain @cw_spn That't the point.  No one is invincible no matter what kind of crap they have gone through.  Things are unfair and anything can happen.  That's why it was good because it was unexpected...shocking to both Dean &amp; Sam and us the viewers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zeCatDoesntSass @cw_spn We can agree to disagree, lol.  But much love, because we were able to have a grown up conversation about our different opinions!  So high-five for that!  üôåüëè<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ranlzz @cw_spn One guy told another guy he loves him even though the other guy doesn't feel that kind of love. You guys were the ones who were demanding "Destiel." The rest of us knew Dean loved Cas as a BFF &amp; bro. Don't trash a finale filmed during a pandemic because you didn't get your way!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@winshawster @cw_spn That's the point. The boys didn't see it coming. A fluke accident which shocked both of them to their core, forcing Dean to share emotions he rarely did about his love for his bro. Dean said in previous seasons he knew he'd go out while hunting. No one was expecting this though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zeCatDoesntSass @cw_spn In a way it embodies Dean more than we would have ever thought.  And dying made him open up to Sam, showing emotions he rarely shared verbally.  Their earthly goodbye was actually very touching, simply because it was such a shock for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zeCatDoesntSass @cw_spn I initially thought Dean's death was anti-climatic as well, but when I thought about past seasons &amp; things he said, it made more sense. And it was something he didn't see coming, which was shocking for him, and Sam. Then his wanting Sam to keep going, live a life without him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zeCatDoesntSass @cw_spn Everything &amp; many supporting characters led up to the one big "baddie" - Chuck. When that was over, Sam &amp; Dean were still the same guys they always were, just with most people around them gone. So they went back to hunting together, but with more freedom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zeCatDoesntSass @cw_spn But that was the point. They had been used as pawns since they were conceived right?  When Chuck lost his power and it transferred to Jack the boys were free. They only knew hunting so they continued, even though they could really die and not come back. (c)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zeCatDoesntSass @cw_spn I thought the girl in the background had brown hair like someone said they saw blond. But then Sam's son had really dark hair &amp; looked like Eileen. Maybe they'll let us know at some point who it was. Because if Sam &amp; Dean had died before and stayed, why shouldn't Eileen have?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bree8314 @AutumnInBuffalo @cw_spn Oh I know.  But when I saw our two boys on that bridge, with absolutely NO pressure on them anymore...knowing they can see their family and friends again anytime.  It's like the "there'll be peace when you are done" come true. And I think that's beautiful :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AutumnInBuffalo @Bree8314 @cw_spn They could have opted not to continue at all, like many other shows but they wanted to give the show a proper end, so they did it, regardless of border issues, all of safety precautions etc, and this likely changed the ending a bit.  Say thank you instead of complaining!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AutumnInBuffalo @Bree8314 @cw_spn Do you know how many people worked their asses off to even give us a finale during a pandemic?  And y'all trash the show simply because of one character who YOU feel should have had a different ending. Have some respect for what they accomplished! (c)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CROWLEYBEANS @cw_spn Cas told Dean how he felt which made him happy. He had a great goodbye scene saving Dean in the process. He's helping Jack like he has since Jack's birth. He can see Dean &amp; Sam anytime. Stop having tantrums because YOUR ending didn't happen &amp; appreciate them giving us a finale.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyWxo @cw_spn Just because he isn't bi doesn't diminish his brotherly bond with Cas. He knows Cas is around. He knows Cas is helping Jack. He, Sam and Cas can see each together at anytime now. Cas is his best friend and Dean loves him for that. It's a beautiful thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeelySwygert @cw_spn Cas was helping his son make sense of everyting he had became and was able to do now and can see Dean a anytime.  The boys began together, and were shown finally at peace together. "There'll be peace when you are done."  https://t.co/ow0MVrejjK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaelenJohnston1 @cw_spn It was a nod to "Always Keep Fighting," as in Sam had to keep going.  Dean took Sam away from a life of a job and family.  So Dean wanted him to go on living life without him, not necessarily "literally" fighting.  Just not giving up on life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zeCatDoesntSass @cw_spn Jensen said he wasn't keen on it because he had always imagined the boys either dying together or continuing living together. He couldn't see just one of them "leaving" and so Eric made sense of it for him. There were likely some changes due to the pandemic as well - less people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zeCatDoesntSass @cw_spn Because they had their goodbyes already, lol! This was about Sam and Dean's earthly goodbye, and then their reuniting in "peace."  Them resting. And the knowledge that Jack's heaven was going to have everyone they loved there at any time.  (c)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itali_69 @CasIsLoved @cw_spn The boys weren't pawns anymore, being used &amp; brought back. They were like everyone else.  Earlier in the series, more than once, he said he knew hunting was going to kill him. And it was an unexpected fluke accident. Something he didn't see coming.  It made complete sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rainbowstiel @cw_spn You did see the 'one last time.' He said his earthy goodbye to Dean (saving him too) which was great. Why diminish that? He was with Jack, helping him, and can see the brothers at any time.  Everyone will be together again at any point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaelenJohnston1 @cw_spn You do realize that this was a finale and was shot during a pandemic, and therefore with as few people as possible right? A LOT of people have been on his show. You can't have them all in the finale! Jack's heaven means everyone will see each other "soon." An open-ended ending.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zeCatDoesntSass @cw_spn Jensen said he would like to direct an SPN movie later on down the road after numerous cast said they'd love to revisit in a few years; that they weren't saying goodbye. Again, Cas was w/Jack which makes sense. Bobby was Dean's father figure. And it was ALWAYS about Dean &amp; Sam!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RevanJJ @zeCatDoesntSass @cw_spn Cas was helping his "son" Jack. Obviously he can see Dean whenever.  It would have made more sense if Dean had seen Mary &amp; John, but obviously with the pandemic they could only have so many people appear.  Dean, Baby &amp; open road w/ no worries. And Sam joining him. It was perfect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zeCatDoesntSass @cw_spn He's helping Jack &amp; obviously can see everyone whenever in heaven. That was what was said by Bobby.  Cas said his earthly goodbye already.  If people hadn't trashed this finale we might have gotten a movie due to the show's open-ended ending. I wouldn't do squat for y'all now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SelfSupremacy @braniellas @yungpurpG @cw_spn Fans for 15 seasons but they completely missed the point of the entire series. Two boys that were pawns while fighting their whole lives. Beginning &amp; ending w/them, each laying their "weary head to rest" - "peace when you are done."  It went back the basics of what it was about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCWM2 @BrandonBrotzman @braniellas @yungpurpG @cw_spn Exactly, with the "always keep fighting" mental health trend.  Dean knew Sam might get depressed and give up on life so to speak - a life that Dean himself pulled Sam away from.  Dean wanted Sam to promise him he'd keep going, that he'd be ok; try to go on and be happy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Leslierod17 @braniellas @yungpurpG @cw_spn Because the show wasn't about Cas.  He was their angel, their brother who did his thing and is now with Jack; still helping him along.  The show began with the boys and ended aptly with the boys. "Peace when you are done."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@braniellas @yungpurpG @cw_spn So-called "fans" seem to forget that Dean &amp; Sam were part of a plan their whole lives; watched &amp; brought back as needed. After Chuck, they became like everyone else &amp; so when hunting they ran the risk of truly dying. Dean said he knew the job would kill him. A fluke accident.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@angelsimpala67 @cw_spn Get over yourselves for frig's sake. It ended as it began &amp; made perfect sense; w/our boys &amp; giving them peace. Throwing temper tantrums isn't the way to say thanks to a cast &amp; crew that gave us a finale during a pandemic when they could have opted out like other shows. #SPNLove<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cw_spn Please don't listen to the entitled children in this thread! Thank you for ending it the way it began; with our boys. Thank you for giving them the "peace when you are done" they deserved. And thank you for keeping it open-ended for a movie at some point. It was beautiful &lt;3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cheesy_Grinner I'm guessing Sam and Jeff could have made an appearance, but with the pandemic and border crossing etc it would have been harder and more work.  There is a beautiful pic of the family of 4 that you've probably seen on instagram that's shown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cheesy_Grinner If you view it as a deserving "see you later" rather than an ending, it goes down much better &lt;3  "There'll be peace when you are done" is the perfect metaphor for this finale. #Supernatural<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thisiskelseyM As much as this fanbase is "loving," (I say that loosely), the entitlement is astounding. They only see what they want to see, call it canon &amp; then freak out if it's different than what THEY had (mis)interpreted it as. Makes me sad for those that worked so hard. #Supernatural<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Supernatural  The only thing I wish I could have seen was the four of them together, reunited in heaven - Dean, Sam, Mary and John. That would have really made me happy-ugly cry. Pandemic would have made it impossible though. Maybe that's why they showed the family pic &lt;3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ASdeclassified LOL  That's a hilarious thought! Thanks for the smile!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thisiskelseyM And it's an "open-ended" ending. Perfect for a movie to happen at some point, if they still want to do one after all the the awful tweets tonight :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedDragonWing I'm so mad at what I'm reading right now, and I hurt for the cast &amp; crew that gave everything during a freakin' pandemic to give us this, because technically, they didn't have to. Other shows would have said screw it. #Supernatural @TheJimMichaels @JensenAckles @jarpad  @cw_spn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you for some appreciation!  This is how it's done!  This is a true fan! üëè<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I'm too old for twitter. Many people acting like entitled kids on here - destroying #Supernatural 's finale. "Saying" they love &amp; appreciate it; except when they don't agree w/the writing. I cant believe that many people would misunderstand what it has always been about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cheesy_Grinner The ending is like the beginning. It's perfectly in line w/the brothers and their journey.  Back to the basics...just the two of them and a freak accident on a hunting trip that could have happened anytime.  And, it doesn't actually end. They are still "around" for more (movie).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want to apologize for the disgusting behavior of many "fans" on twitter right now. I appreciate what you did w/this episode &amp; the meaning behind it. TY so much for your hard work &amp; dedication to our boys on &amp; off screen #Supernatural @TheJimMichaels @JensenAckles  @jarpad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I honestly can't get over how ungrateful &amp; nonsensical so many #Supernatural fans are. The temper tantrums when they don't get their way is disgusting. This finale makes sense IF you have honestly understood the show you were watching for 15 years! Be grateful FOR/TO our boys!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@staceyk1968 Hope all goes well.  I have furbabies so I get it.  Much love!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>it was just a matter of time. Remember too, they had angels and everyone watching over them and now there's nothing. The boys are like everyone else. No special luck. And, this way, they haven't truly ended #Supernatural .  So I get why it was written this way. @cw_spn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Supernatural It began with the boys on a hunting trip, &amp; thus it ends for them (on earth) that way. I makes sense if you think about it. Everything that they have fought &amp; a fluke hunting accident take Dean out. And Dean said one time he knew he was going to go out that way, (c)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@masterofzerofs But at the same time it makes all the sense in the world.  A hunting accident takes him out.  Out of nowhere.  A shock to them, and us.  Know what I mean? #Supernatural<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Y'all gotta chill about Cas not being in this finale. I just watched the whole thing an hour early.  For frigs sakes, it began with the boys and it ends with the boys. Cas had his time. Enjoy the brothers. They ARE the show whether you as a fan like it or not.   #Supernatural<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshleySnippe @CTVSciFi I have a feeling people aren't going to like this finale.  There is going to be a lot of complaining...just watch.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AshleySnippe @CTVSciFi Such bull crap splitting it up like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshleySnippe Wait...back the eff up, So they aren't even showing the interview right after the show???????  @CTVSciFi what the hell!  You've really messed this entire thing up!!!!! #Supernatural<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshleySnippe Seemed like Eileen because I imagine Jack brought her back, plus the kid looked like her.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AshleySnippe I don't know what I was hoping for....I feel like it wasn't real.  I can see why Jensen was on the fence about it when he was told.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Purple_HippoDog Ugh I can't believe this.  I'm watching it on a Canadian scifi channel. I wonder if they are going to air it after?   Son of a bitch!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>SPN FAMILY HELP ME OUT.  I don't seem to be watching the same episode as what everyone is talking about.  They just saved two boys and are gonna kill guys with masks.  No Castiel or anything. What are you watching????#Supernatural<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I missed the first 5 minutes because of tv probs üò≠  What did I miss???  So are these "vamp mimes" the last case? Everything seems so normal. #Supernatural<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone else been obsessed @ the finale since Jensen mentioned the problem he initially had w/it? I seriously have no idea what's going to happen &amp; what could make him concerned, other than a death of one of them? But then, there's talk about a movie someday, so... #Supernatural<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From beginning to end, it was all about them. Thank you for the life. Thank you for the laughs. And most of all, thank you for the love.

<|startoftext|>@JC90266 @JamelTheCreator @mcuban @johnlegend You are right, most individuals can't. People who make millions &amp; billions of dollars can make a huge difference.

<|startoftext|>@johnlegend @mcuban Charity can change people's lives.  Charity can lead to education.  Charity can help keep people from dying.

<|startoftext|>@MrJakeAbel I just want peace &amp; calm after the results are in. That's in everybody's best interests more than anything. No riots. No violence. No matter who gets in, accept it &amp; move on like every other election. That's what democracy is &amp; you get to try again for change in another 4 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@3mz79 @TheJimMichaels If the forceful attitudes don't change (again on either side), you guys will see fighting &amp; violence your country hasn't seen since your civil war.

<|startoftext|>@3mz79 @TheJimMichaels Yet everyone has the right to vote for who they want.  That is democracy whether people like their choices or not.

<|startoftext|>I'm not even American &amp; my anxiety is peaking for the election. Not for the results (both choices are bad &amp; both parties are corrupt as hell), but for the reaction/behavior of the people when they are shared.

<|startoftext|>@TheJimMichaels I think posts like these do nothing to help the already lit powder keg that America is.  Everyone needs to vote for who will help them best and shut up about it.

<|startoftext|>@World3nder @bentbananabooks @anna_orso Cops from other countries take armed suspects in all the time without killing them.

<|startoftext|>@Chunky_Moes @anna_orso I get it but there is a huge difference between pumping ONE or TWO shots into a person &amp; 2 cops emptying their weapon.

<|startoftext|>@DeniseA08048 @Franklin_Graham @Mike_Pence Therefore believers in America have a problem. Their two main choices don't exhibit traits embodied by followers of Christ.

<|startoftext|>@DeniseA08048 @Franklin_Graham @Mike_Pence I said nothing about who God is using. I'm saying, as a follower of Christ, is that you can't ignore the actions of people on either side who don't EXHIBIT the traits a follower of Christ should have. Trump's not a follower of Christ, he's a user of Christ for his own objectives.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Lopezdot0 @TheAcademy Exactly. And do you think it's right to say, "hey, we have minorities working behind the scenes now, so give us our Oscar."  POC deserve better. They deserve funding to create content/have representation onscreen. If they can create more the Oscars will have more to choose from.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BoopedyBeep @TheAcademy Hiring for behind the scenes, which isn't addressing the real issue which is funding &amp; support for minority creators so the Oscars have more diverse content to choose from. This isn't fixing the problem. It's simply keeping some movies from being considered, hindering creativity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteWolf496 @TheAcademy Then there will be complaints that production companies are doing that just to be considered and that not enough minorities aren't making it on screen.  That's why it needs to come down to funding for more minority driven content so they really get a seat at the table.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheAcademy So in effect, you are inciting reverse discrimination.   The real issue is funding for creative minorities so they can create more content, which would then give you more to draw from when choosing nominees.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheAcademy Under this, you'll exclude many movies based on historical/fantasy works simply due to the time &amp; personal standpoint the author was drawing from. The Lord of The Rings movies wouldn't have even been considered for an Oscar despite them being the greatest trilogy ever made. (c)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aquariiqueen @XRebellionUK My point is, if we stop purchasing the products that aren't good for a planet these people won't be making their money any longer.

<|startoftext|>@StarTrek @simonpegg To me, Kirk, Spock and Bones are the foundation of the crew, and their interaction; their friendship was the best &amp; most meaningful parts of TOS &amp; movies. If you want the Kelvin timeline to thrive, that needs to be understood.  Think of the conversation Kirk had after Spock (c)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarTrek @simonpegg Trek is primarily about the crew &amp; this movie allowed a realistic view on long term space travel &amp; the missions' effects on a Captain who, because of his station, is essentially 'alone," along w/ his identity crisis. What I liked is the focus on the 3 more - Kirk, Spock &amp; Bones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sirenawolff @DSVirus @StarTrek  https://t.co/57YgSkgW3B<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarTrek Best movie of the 3.  I feel like it really found it's niche through @simonpegg 's writing as he was more interested in aligning it w/ TOS rather then trying to replace it as JJ tried to do.

<|startoftext|>@shaunking Following Jesus doesn't require Him to be white.  True believers know His racial heritage.

Far different than racist history makers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gervilla6 @shaunking John's vision in Revelations has Jesus' skin as shining and bronze. Jesus was a Jew.  The bible was written based on Arab &amp; Jewish history &amp; geography.  I think it's pretty clear He wasn't white, but yes, He died for all - one human race.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShirleyWhel07 @shaunking The Bible didn't have to mention skin colour. It &amp; it's peoples were based on/in Arab &amp; Jewish nations.

<|startoftext|>And of course to top it off, people are allowed to protest in the streets. Sooo...how does that make sense?  I'm for the protests but if people can legally gather in large numbers to do so, open my Canadian Tire Store to everyone for frig's sake!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@imcorinnemec @MichaelCoudrey Corin! You thought so too???!!! Half to most of the stuff from season 5 was shit that either lacked in continuity or was purely for fan service.

<|startoftext|>@philtorious @MeghanMcCain That's not true.  The UK pays for all the royal's security detail, whether they are working royals or not. Canada may have assisted while they were staying here (as happens in other countries they go to), but the bulk is always paid by the UK and always has been.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is fake news! Anyone who knows Britain's royal protocol knows that the UK pays for the security of all the royals, whether they are working royals or not, wherever they are.

<|startoftext|>@imcorinnemec @Timcast Ya. In the poorer areas of southern Italy people are getting desperate &amp; crime gangs are taking advantage.

<|startoftext|>#WhenCoronaVirusIsOver is a dangerous thought.  It won't ever be 'over' per se. It'll become another of the many viruses that'll float around the planet from time to time.

<|startoftext|>@imcorinnemec It's a no-win scenario we are in. I know you keep aligning it with other illnesses &amp; that's part of the problem.  An epidemic that is this contagious, along WITH other known viruses/diseases is too much to deal with.  And this one can still mutate again, making it worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imcorinnemec Do you consider doctors/scientists part of the media? We can look at this from every angle but it comes back to the same thing - this pandemic spreads fast overwhelming our healthcare systems AND it's risky quarantining everyone because people need to work.  (c)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imcorinnemec Check out the issues at Elmhurst hospital in Queens for one.        And again, it's early.  Things are going to get worse for a month or two.  No one really has the answers.  It's literally a rock &amp; a hard place scenario. But if the hospitals go down, everyone is screwed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CallMeBella_74 @imcorinnemec And that's the point.  This is no regular flu.  It's fast...faster than our hospitals can keep up with.   I pray God protects you from the worst of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imcorinnemec The number of fatalities has been swift. Every day the infection rates &amp; deaths rise. Look at at Italy's death toll in a matter of a few months.

<|startoftext|>@Mcfarmswife @imcorinnemec I've thought about them knowing more than they are saying, numerous times.  But is it not being shared with governments?  Because all of them are dealing (or not dealing) with this differently.  I'd think if there was one big secret, most of the governments would show solidarity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imcorinnemec I'm with you there. I'm more of a government skeptic.  I've got no real trust because ALL levels &amp; officials have their own agendas, secrets, biases etc...  As for the media, in this day and age it's strictly about pushing a certain agenda for one side. No objectivity anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mcfarmswife @imcorinnemec I think Corin is more concerned about how long people can go without work than rights being taken away.  Caring individuals aren't so concerned about that. Like I said in my other reply, we really are between a rock and a hard place.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@imcorinnemec I really don't know.

<|startoftext|>@UWBio Every leader represents the people who voted them in more than the people who didn't.  That's just a fact and why there are elections to change leadership.  My PM doesn't represent me, but that's just the way it is until the majority elects someone else who does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FortEsprit @UWBio I'm not comparing them. I said one is a journalist who is supposed to be impartial. Any leader of a country is going to be more "left or right" because they represent their base more than the people that didn't vote them in. Just as Obama didn't represent the Republican voters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UWBio Don Lemon is supposed to be a journalist and impartial; simply stating the news and not his opinion about it. And no, I'm not a Trump supporter.  My father was a journalist.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@livxhope @BernieSanders Bernie's other platform areas would support a single mother, helping her to succeed. There is such a thing as the morning after pill &amp; contraception. Cases of rape &amp; incest occur far less than the main reason for abortions, which is convenience, lack of contraception &amp; education.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BernieSanders That is an oxymoron. So healthcare doesn't extend to unborn children? I agree w/universal healthcare which would help single mothers etc, but abortions are a personal choice to terminate a pregnancy. They aren't often mandatory to a woman's health &amp; shouldn't be paid for w/taxes.<|endoftext|>

Too many years w/this character to not have advance notice &amp; proper send off.  Something's fishy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The more I'm reading about Justin Chambers' "already happened" exit the more something doesn't seem right. Middle of the season, no send off. This kind of thing usually happens if there's been behind the scenes drama/creative differences. And no one is talking.  #AlexKarev #Greys  https://t.co/eEIzmmfhK9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshliSlytherin Say what?  No...they must have meant it has already been filmed.  https://t.co/BTwulsH4cq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds like this guy might actually respect Roddenberry's scientific/exploration vision.  Just keep the same cast because they're great if given good canon character material. I'd like to see more use of @KarlUrban because he's an AMAZING Bones! #StarTrek   https://t.co/v3RbhuHmMo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If they kill Alex Karev off, I'm not going to watch.  There is just no way!  Losing him, and his and Jo's relationship is a deal breaker for me and I cry over fictional characters enough already.  He's staying &amp; they're going to have a happy life together!   #Jolex #GreysAnatomy  https://t.co/9WuaK5MtlQ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@XtTwist @Suffragentleman Because people are assholes. They have to target their hatred on others.

<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK You do realize a lot of clothes are gifted to royals &amp; celebs, right?  Plus she wears many more than once &amp; has donated several items to her charity.

<|startoftext|>@itvnews @chrisshipitv "Tasking Harry..."  Seriously. Could you be more ignorant?  Given everything the press has put her though, he clearly wanted to protect her and deal with this cruel nonsense himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelenAnnSmith0 Harry likely wanted her to leave so she didn't have to deal with this ridiculous fall out from the press who mislead the public with their false headlines.  And to deal with the family who never seemed to give a damn about them in the first place.<|endoftext|>

She's been attacked, her privacy invaded &amp; has been character assassinated.  And yet SHE's to blame?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frnklns4k @Elizbeth_SS @RoyalFamily They give more in one "duty" outing than all the royals combined.  They have been a breath of fresh air since Diana passed.  A genuine care for people and charities.  You can see it with every warm interaction.  Not cold &amp; aloof like the others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anna_itsonlyme @RoyalFamily Exactly!  They deserve a least that from their "family."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaldArchie2 @JamileAurora @RoyalFamily She did everything she was asked to do and more, all the while getting verbally attacked, her privacy invaded, and character assassinated.  It's a wonder it's gone on this long. Harry's finally putting his foot down and it's about time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhoebeDinsmore_ @RoyalFamily H&amp;M are the only ones who seem to sincerely care for people, something the royal family has needed since Diana died.  They are shooting themselves in the foot in not having aided H&amp;M during the personal attacks on them &amp; their privacy, all while they were doing their duties.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReedusCanadafan @RoyalFamily Shame on he Queen for not showing aid and support for attacked family members as part of her "duties!"  Guess it should have been written in her itinerary!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SurvivesThe @RoyalFamily And how do you know he hasn't been trying to get their help for some time now!?  H&amp;M's documentary even told how they were struggling with the attacks.  It doesn't take a genius to see that this was going to be the result since H&amp;M have been fighting things alone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsaseachel @schaekay1 @RoyalFamily No Meghan wasn't going to be Queen, but she damn well deserved respect as a human being, which she has never gotten in Britain. And yes, she is a victim under the very definition of the word. Mercilessly attacked, privacy invaded, character assassination...the list goes on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@things_royal @RoyalFamily They've never refused to do their duties! They did them all &amp; every single time they did they were attacked/insulted for their looks &amp; any action they made. Not to mention the lies about her pregnancy, birth &amp; innocent baby! The Queen/Britain did this to themselves! They're loss!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kirty_dwh @RoyalFamily Shame on the Queen and others for not helping Harry and Meghan.  Queen or not, what kind of grandmother with that kind of influence doesn't show any kind of compassion &amp; support for family when they are mercilessly attacked?!  She left them no choice!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JenniferEWatts @RoyalFamily And it's really made them look bad!  I'm learning just how cold and self-serving the royal family must be.  H&amp;M must have really felt alone to feel they had to do this to protect themselves &amp; their son, but also still serve the community at large. They have big hearts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoyalFamily You should have made a statement &amp; shown support to H&amp;M instead of leaving them in the lions den w/the vicious tabloid press. Family is supposed to be a lifeline &amp; the royal family should have included love &amp; compassion in with their "duties."  H&amp;M have to protect themselves now.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RoyalDickie I honestly think Harry told his family, you either print/speak out in support for Meghan and I against the constant attacks or we're out.  The Queen &amp; family said/did absolutely nothing &amp; now we see the result of that non-support.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoyalDickie I don't blame them in the least. The entire atmosphere around the royal family is cold &amp; about 'self'. Harry, who is very personable has always struggled with that &amp; Meghan is the same. He needs to do what he must to protect his family from the toxicity of the British society.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoyalDickie When I remember him talking about how he was forced to walk behind his mother's body &amp; what it did to him. Joining the forces to escape. And he's always been "too" caring &amp; personable for a royal family member.  Meghan saved him. No doubt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jennasauers So true. When I remember him talking about how he was forced to walk behind his mother's body &amp; what it did to him. Joining the forces to escape. And he's always been "too" caring &amp; personable for a royal family member.  Meghan saved him. No doubt.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JonnyDymond Hmm, funny.  Harry and Meghan have been hurting from the treatment by the royal family for some time now... ü§î   Guess the family should have shown them some love and support instead of allowing the vicious British tabloid pit bulls attack them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cappykim @EHolmes The royal family burned their bridge with Harry and Meghan when the attacks were happening and not one of them came out and spoke/wrote anything in support.  H&amp;M did everything that was asked of them &amp; got trampled. No more.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Never expected to have sympathy for Prince Charles ever in my life, but then I watched season 3 episode 6 of @TheCrown &amp; it broke my heart. If it's truth, it explains a lot.

<|startoftext|>@hockeynight @RonMacLeanHTH All the good that Don has done. All the fallen or hurt soldiers he used his air time to pay respect to. He demanded defibrillators in rinks. Mentioned sick children &amp; shared personal messages w/ people. Could you not have went to bat for the guy as he did for you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GolfedUp @PJWarren1226 @iwuvmarty @hockeynight He was only targeting new immigrants who don't put in the effort to wear a poppy.  Not the ones who have served.

<|startoftext|>I miss hockey the way it used to be in the 90's &amp; before. Coach's Corner was the last piece of those glory days left.

<|startoftext|>@kwetoday How is hockey filled with racism? There is more diversity than there has ever been before and it's growing along with how diverse our country has become. There are so many more programs now helping kids from all backgrounds give the sport a try. Both boys and girls.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hannah_Bevis1 Without that "old boys club" HNIC wouldn't exist. All the "old boys" shouldn't be fired based on their age, colour and sex.

<|startoftext|>@CrazyChiarelli @CoachsCornerDC You know what though? He'd do so much better with a podcast or something. They barely give him any time on CC anymore and apparently the 7 second delay wasn't enough for the PC police there. I say give him his own show like he had with the Grapevine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realGpad Living in smaller residences and buying less is needed, as large homes &amp; production takes a lot of energy. Getting rid of single use plastics is a great way to start. So many things that are 'recyclable' aren't actually recycled, so try not to buy it in the first place.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hockeynight Should've let Don have the chance to explain himself. I hope he gets a "Grapevine" podcast or something going. Coach's Corner was the last thing outside of the game itself that was patriotic &amp; Canadian in the program. 38 seasons and no "thank you" or tribute for him. No thanks.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JaimeNason @Peccleston @Jeffer_Laughlin @RonMacLeanHTH He singled out people who have moved here that aren't wearing them, not those who came here and are wearing them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaimeNason @Peccleston @Jeffer_Laughlin @RonMacLeanHTH He didn't demand. He simply said the people who move here should wear the symbol for those who made it possible to be here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peccleston @JaimeNason @Jeffer_Laughlin @RonMacLeanHTH Probably because he figured they had a more current reason to do so. Because the poppies are a symbol for those who made it possible for people to move here for a better &amp; safer life.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cbcsports @hockeynight For Remembrance Day, we should remember our serviceman serving and dying in the very countries people are immigrating here from. So yes, wear a damn poppy to say thank you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cbcsports @hockeynight You can have worn blackface numerous times &amp; exempt Christian youth from job programs based on their religious beliefs &amp; still be a PM, yet you can't say that people who've immigrated to Canada should wear a poppy. Double-standards are rampant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peccleston @JaimeNason @Jeffer_Laughlin @RonMacLeanHTH But he has the freedom to state his opinion like everyone else. The poppy is a mass-symbol of observance. Newcomers should be happy to take part in respect to so many who served and died. Some Canadians are still serving &amp; dying in those very countries they are immigrating from.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hockeynight But not everybody /has/ to take part in Remembrance Day right? I mean, it's not mandatory or anything. That is what you are saying by firing Don Cherry for him saying that immigrants should wear them like everyone else living in this country should.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can have worn blackface numerous times &amp; exempt Christian youth from job programs based on their religious beliefs &amp; still be a PM, yet you can't say that people who've immigrated to Canada should wear a poppy.

<|startoftext|>@JaimeNason @Jeffer_Laughlin @RonMacLeanHTH If people aren't obliged to wear a poppy then perhaps they should migrate to a country that didn't participate in the fight for freedom in the wars.

<|startoftext|>@frfrankpavone Bullying in all forms, to all "levels" of peoples should not be ok. I can't believe I have to remind a priest that we are to attempt to live as Jesus did. You need to do some serious praying to understand the grace and mercy you should be preaching about.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ok, so if Chuck has less power, does Sam have some of it? #ThingsThatMakeYouGoHmm ... #Supernatural<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, so a future episode this season will be a crazy ghost Kevin that Sam &amp; Dean will have to put down. Good to know. #Supernatural<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RiddikulusDan Good catch.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I have the feeling I'm the only lady fan who crochets while watching #Supernatural. Does that give away my age demographic? ü§î<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really I don't blame Rowena. Ketch is a handsome man and the British accent seals it. What can ya do? @DavidHaydnJones @RuthieConnell  #Supernatural<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So is there a connection between Sam and Chuck now? ü§î #Supernatural<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ScienceFiction If it wasn't for Negan and Judith, we'd probably give up. Though Maggie is returning next season so there may be hope for improvement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear @TheEmmys @oscar8 (whomever it concerns) Please give @aaronpaul_8 another award for his portrayal of Jesse Pinkman. There will never be another role like it acted with the kind of magnificence Aaron gives. Sincerely, @BreakingBad fans who watched El Camino tonight. @netflix<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeedsAMargarita @TheEmmys @oscar8 @aaronpaul_8 @BreakingBad @netflix But he just did a 2 hour movie as him, so...I think another one is needed. Or considering it's a movie, give the man an Oscar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As with Breaking Bad it was extremely well acted, directed &amp; filmed. I mean some of those amazing camera shots really brought back the overall ambience of Breaking Bad. I just think for a 2 hour movie there could have been more going on. But watch it for a good ending! #ElCamino<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not sure how I feel about #ElCamino . My husband kept falling asleep and we are big fans of Breaking Bad. I feel like it was lacking something to keep it interesting and you wanting more. The only thing that really got me was Skinny Pete &amp; Badger and Walt. (c)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eabarlin @K_JeanPierre Oh I agree. Not everyone will do it unless something big goes down and we're all forced to. But each of us who want to make a real impact can start to learn and change our habits. It will even be healthier for us in the long run.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eabarlin @K_JeanPierre through multiple resources, mostly watching youtube videos that show what other people are doing, how it works for them as well as the alternative materials/products they use. There are some great ideas and such out there :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eabarlin @K_JeanPierre People aren't ignoring it because Jane Fonda hadn't held a sign yet. People who are ignoring this worldwide exposure we are seeing in multiple countries are doing so because they either don't want to change, don't believe it will make a difference or don't know how. I'm learning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eabarlin @K_JeanPierre That's not what I said. I said for people to actively make the change. Change is a process.  And you hit the nail on the head. Imagine if everyone said they would only do enough to not upset their lives too much. Therein lies the choice we have to make. What is more important?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eabarlin @K_JeanPierre Publicity for what??? "Come and stand out here with us?" If she wants to use her publicity, start a blog or vlog showing how she is LIVING the change she wants to happen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eabarlin @K_JeanPierre it's looks good. Stop buying the latest gadgets when what you have still works. Shop bulk stores &amp; grow some of your own your own food. Buy used clothing, furniture etc. Imagine the real impact we'd have. There are SO many things a person can do but how many are trying to do it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eabarlin @K_JeanPierre It's the same with many of the protesters. Live what you are asking. Get the single use plastics out of your house. Carpool, use public transport, energy efficient power sources. Try to live with more of what you already have and need rather than buying what is a fad or because<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eabarlin @K_JeanPierre My point is, celebrities love to talk a lot but few practice what they preach. I'm attempting to do what I had described but it's taking time because some of the switching costs money, but they could change their lives almost immediately. Going to prison doesn't fix the problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElliottBlackwe3 Do you listen to Loreena McKennit? I think you'd really like her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElliottBlackwe3 I have a pinterest board with a collection of my fav English cottages. I mean, a girl can dream....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realGpad @jarpad I'm buying the same. Wax wraps and wax paper. On my last roll of plastic wrap then never again. Look at every plastic source in your kitchen and see if there is alternative. Then work on the bathroom plastics where you can buy bamboo toothbrushes, reusable razors etc. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@K_JeanPierre Hope she's wearing eco-friendly fabrics, lives in a home that takes little energy to maintain, fights mass consumption &amp; aspires to live a 0-waste lifestyle. It means a lot more than standing &amp; holding a sign. Imagine if everyone actually ACTED on their complaint. #ClimateChange<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Not a big fan of Trump, but @CBCNews talking about how his #July4th speech shouldn't be about how America got it's freedom through brave men &amp; military totally explains why Canada has a leader who doesn't support/has total disregard for our military &amp; their works.  @CanadianPM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@weathernetwork We've known this a long time. Do a piece on how many countries have little to no vegetation left &amp; refuse to replant.

<|startoftext|>Complaints - Daavos‚Äô plot armor is stronger than dragon scale. Again...not a scratch on him!  #GameofThrones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Complaints - 10. Poor Varys‚Ä¶..just when he got some screen time and dialogue. Will we ever see what he got up to in his chambers with the scrolls and what was up with his little bird? Probably not.  #GameofThrones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Complaints - Jaime escaping after Tyrion freed him despite thousands of Unsullied around, AND Tyrion still being alive to see the battle. Like, did no one tell Dany her Hand freed Jaime? #GameofThrones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Complaints - The weird focus on that women and child was just‚Ä¶.weird. Were we supposed to feel something for them in the tiny increments we saw them?  #GameofThrones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Complaints - The butchering of Jaime‚Äôs redemption arc is complete, and our hopes for the prophecy being fulfilled in the show for Cersei‚Äôs death dashed like our hopes for it to get better by the last episode.  #GameofThrones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Complaints - Wildfire doesn‚Äôt stay in in one section‚Ä¶.it consumes. The whole city should have been green instead of pockets of it dotted around. #GameofThrones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Complaints - Arya goes ALL the way to KL with The Hound and all it takes is one phrase from him to have her change her mind about killing Cersei. Maybe he could have said it to her as they were leaving the gates of Winterfell and saved her the trip. #GameofThrones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Complaints - Jaime and Euron‚Äôs fight was lame. Who even cared. Glad D&amp;D‚Äôs Euron is dead. It was torture to watch that character butchered so badly. #GameofThrones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Complaints - Yet another month passes to get from the north to KL and Cersei still wasn‚Äôt showing despite her supposed to be about 6 months along. #GameofThrones<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Question about #AvengersEndgame .... Why is Spiderman and his buddy still in high school if 5 years have passed???? @TomHolland1996 @Russo_Brothers Anyone???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mcfarmswife I have a new theory on the ease of he Night Kings demise... What if he marked Bran so upon his possible death, Bran would become the new and unexpected Night King and the battle could essentially begin again at another time...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the plus side, at least my beloved #LOTR movies battle scenes being the best ever on any screen still haven't been challenged!  It's too bad this Winterfell battle didn't even come close, or at least what you could see of it.  #GameofThrones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mcfarmswife Yeah but I honeslty feel like Arya moving in for the kill was about fanservice and feminism. Most of the males in this episode did nothing, especially Jon, who IS Ice &amp; Fire!  Hell, some of them were portrayed as cowardly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's like all the lore, all the mythology, all the prophecies......just completely forgotten. What a slap in the face to @GRRMspeaking . As every episode passes, I yearn all the more for the better story that will be The Winds of Winter. #ASOIAF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awful battle tactics, awful use of the castle, awful uses of the dragons....the mishaps in this episode took any emotions away. And the ease of killing The Night King was way off when you know the book history.  #GameofThrones #Winterfell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ummm.....that's it?  I only felt Theon (I cried). Barely anyone notable died. I couldn't see most of the battle because of 'snow' and smoke. For all the hype that was one of the most underwhelming things I've watched! #NotHelmsDeep #GameofThrones #Winterfell  https://t.co/ibC1SrqVyn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Came on only to check out tweets about @GameOfThrones , even though I'm sure I wont actually be able to tear my eyes away from the tv during #BattleOfWinterfell , or see because of my tears... Yeah, I'm not ready.  https://t.co/1YgM2ev2Ze<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DrRoundball @peta But that has nothing to do with Animal Adventure Park, which is the park that PETA is condemning. April has had 2 calves at AAP.

<|startoftext|>@manwith3buttock When compared to other book content they left out, absolutely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paradiseIeah lol Too true. And as a book reader, I don't know what to trust...if things will be different, so I am imagining even more heartbreak when TWOW comes out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RC_Love77 LOL  I just think it will be so because his entire life he has thought he was nothing. And he has endured so many losses in this fight with the dead. I think he'll fight for the throne in honor of Dany but be more sullen than ever becuase of what it took to get there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RC_Love77 Sam will be Maester of he Red Keep and.......Tyrion as hand and Arya &amp; Gendry will marry (remember what Robert said about his son marrying Ned's daughter in season 1.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RC_Love77 I agree with 1. Not sure yet about 2, but I think Bran will warg Viserion. Love the Brienne idea!  I think Jon will have to "Nissa Nissa" (something that happened in the books) Dany to save everyone and then he'll reluctantly claim the the throne.<|endoftext|>

Gotcha. ie: babies are disposable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Math_Mama_G @ChangetheChoice The baby is already poisoned and their bones/lungs ruined while still in the womb so when exactly are they physically seen and handle by a doctor, before that mutilation to their bodies. to be sure of their options after delivery?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Math_Mama_G @ChangetheChoice Moms make that awful choice all the time but at least they have the knowledge that their baby was loved and felt that love in their final moments/minutes/hours, just as any other human being deserves know and feel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Math_Mama_G @ChangetheChoice These babies are poisoned, their bones grotesquely mutilated, and disgustingly extracted from their mother without even the chance to be examined by a team.

<|startoftext|>@Math_Mama_G @ChangetheChoice I heard/saw my baby's heartbeat as they were dying inside of me. If it had been an age to deliver and doctors able to do whatever they could to at least try and save them, I would have welcomes it, no matter the hellish outcome.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Math_Mama_G @ChangetheChoice A baby who cannot survive a vaginal birth can be delivered quickly via c-section. If the baby dies, the mother can at least go through a healthy grieving process over the loss of her child. Again, these are tiny humans we should treat as such. We mustn't lose that compassion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Math_Mama_G @NYGovCuomo How do they know that for sure until delivery? If the baby is still alive in the womb, they deliver, examine, and provide the child with the medical care &amp; dignity every human deserves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Math_Mama_G @NYGovCuomo outside of the womb with medical assistance that would be given to a baby in the same situation next door, why isn't it being done? And where is the baby's health mentioned? The law states when the mother's health is at risk only.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Math_Mama_G @NYGovCuomo The baby is removed from the uterus in the breech position, with mechanical collapse of the baby's skull if it is too large to fit through the cervical canal. (They only dilate to 2-5 centimeters) So yes, I do ask, yet again, if it is statistically possible for a baby to survive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Math_Mama_G @NYGovCuomo Most medical communities establish 24 weeks gestation, the later part of the second trimester, as the earliest time of viability.

<|startoftext|>@Math_Mama_G @NYGovCuomo You mean baby.  It's a human baby in the womb....it's a human baby out of the womb. There is no difference.  Humanity isn't disposable. No one is.

<|startoftext|>@VictoriaSeries This show is so stunning &lt;3 Beautifully written and acted. It needs a hell of a lot more praise and attention than it gets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ComplexMusic And how sad is it that there are woman who would want to be treated this way by these kind of men who think this way. Women need to stop reducing themselves to sex slaves for men, in media or real life.  https://t.co/fV6XCLuX7v<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gregg_mashberg @IlhanMN @harryreis Right! The Palestinians are victims of their terrorist leadership, not Israel.

Facts are out there is one wants to know them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IlhanMN A woman has the right to defend herself against violence. So does a nation whether it is Israel or any other.

<|startoftext|>@IlhanMN Considering how many women are risking their reputations, lives and scorn of their families in the fight to take off their hijabs I wouldn't consider this that positive of a thing. Historically hijabs are a clear sign of oppression of women, not democracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikeyoranje88 @1jewishatheist @IlhanMN So you can imagine how rare it would be for it to be actually allowed in most Middle Eastern parliaments, or how many women would be allowed to work in that sector at all, to which there is info if you research.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>More &amp; more, women are making me ashamed of being a woman. Just so sick of the whining/complaining.

<|startoftext|>@robanski Damn my #Kastle heart üò≠<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4 episodes into @ThePunisher now. Feeling conflicted &amp; overwhelmed. It's almost like they're throwing too much into each episode w/ all these characters &amp; their individual SLs/issues. Hard to focus on an actual plot that makes @jonnybernthal ; our Frank, shine. #punisherseason2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeborahAnnWoll @jonnybernthal @ejscott @ThePunisher @netflix The fact that you used the #Kastle hashtag just killed me, lol &lt;3 We've been blessed with every appearance you've made in both @Daredevil and @ThePunisher and @netflix &amp; @Marvel has their fanbase wrong if they can't see how good everyone is together!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EW - Karen, and more Karen, and maybe some more Karen -  We here you @jonnybernthal ... Boy do we ever hear you &lt;3 #KastlePlease Come on @netflix give us what everyone wants! Even if it's just for a little while. @DeborahAnnWoll is badass &amp; they are epic together onscreen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brentsmi I've been seeing mixed reviews. But for me it is lacking something. Only two episodes in though so maybe that will change. Let me know what you think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@madebygoogle We haven't tried since. It's with our tv that had Roku programmed into it when we bought it. Though that was a while ago and it had been working fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok I gotta be honest. I'm 2 episodes into #ThePunisherS2 and wondering where the magic of season 1 has gone?

P.S - Frank kissing non-Karen better be a mistake cause my #Kastle heart is fragile enough! You and Jon are incredible on screen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe I'm crazy but all I can think about with the new @ThePunisher season is Frank kissing non-Karen.

<|startoftext|>@CatholicHerald This doesn't make sense. God is the beginning and the end. He chose her to birth His son so Jesus could die for all of us sinners, including Mary as a human being.

<|startoftext|>@MPRadamacue @MiguelRaizoki @theoneringnet It's true. I love a lot of his work, and I do like the cast of the reboot, but it's his re-vision of it that is wrong.

<|startoftext|>@JohnWebster84 @theoneringnet I'm a fan of most of those as well, and it's not the cast of the reboot Star Trek that is the problem, it's his vision of it. He's good with original stuff, but tends to have little knowledge or care of established material he takes on.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@imcorinnemec You need to change that sentence to - I don't care about people who think I'm being offensive when I post my neutral opinion on a subject I care about.  Because I'm good enough, I'm smart enough, and doggone it, people like me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imcorinnemec I saw no change, which means I'm probably way too boring to be followed by bots or fake accounts. The people who follow me are real people who like me, and there are dozens! Dozens I tell you!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In saying that though, I have to admit the IronFist to Luke's hand creating a shockwave thing was definitely cool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So in this episode I'm watching Danny Rand basically becomes Luke Cage's Yoda.  And yes, Iron Fist is still the worst cast character in the history of Marvel.  #LukeCageSeason2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SuperWiki For the people saying this will be the last season, I honestly think they will give more notice than that given how emotional the fandom is. I could see them stating season 15 will be the end assuming they are picked up as usual, giving us a year's notice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bgeesfan @SuperWiki I've thought for a while now that they will stop at 15 seasons.

<|startoftext|>Watched the 1st episode of #LukeCageSeason2 tonight. I don't think it's going to be a strong as the 1st season likely because we're missing the tremendous acting of Mahershala Ali, but we still have Rossi, Woodard, Missick and Dawson which are huge pluses.  Cornier for sure tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a mom of 2 sons it terrifies me that it can be so easy to ruin lives on the basis of one person's word. Not all women are saints or victims.

<|startoftext|>@CanadasGinger One of those "qualified women" ran this province into the ground.

<|startoftext|>@Neko1845 How is he like Donald Trump exactly? Because he wants to keep businesses from leaving Ontario/Canada by lowering their high taxes which will combat losses of jobs?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xosnsd Cheaper hydro, fighting the carbon tax we don't deserve, working with businesses so they don't leave our province/country due to high taxes resulting in lost jobs, a plan for a more balanced budget, fixing infrastructure. Sounds like a platform to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you Ontario! Hopefully in the coming months I'll be able to afford my electricity bill again &amp; at some point afford to put gas in my vehicle if we can get rid of the carbon tax we don't deserve because Canada is basically carbon neutral!  #ElectionsOntario #ConservativesWin<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JeffreyVParise Long live the Colonel Sanders of SPN, lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mike11857392 @LeeCamp It is against a decades old international law to use chemical weapons on this planet, so the US and allies legally went in and took out strategic targets. There was intel regarding the chemical attacks themselves and what facilities carried/made them. It was not against civilians<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mike11857392 @LeeCamp You realize there are two major factions in Syria: The Syrian army &amp;the rebels. Each will use propoganda to make the other look bad, along w/ anyone who "interferes." You can't believe everything that comes out of Syria.

<|startoftext|>@kadhimalz The innocent people are housed in military instillations and chemical weapons sites?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>but you all still think the two men are working together or "Putin owns Trump"? LOL Let me tell you something. Putin cares about his foothold in the Middle East &amp; power. The only thing he cares about is whether the US will stop him in attaining that, and the US won't back down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and Trump has expressed anger over Syria using chemical weapons saying Assad and Russia are lying abot their use... And Trump orders a missile attack againt chemical/military installations despite Russia warning them not to... (c)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So let me get this straight, people think Trump is connected to Putin, even though they are throwing sanctions at one another and expelling diplomats over the nerve agent attack against two people in the UK.. (c)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kadhimalz He's supporting international law. A signed declaration decades old saying that there is absolutely no tolerance when it comes to chemical weapons. And for the record, Russia views everyone who isn't them as targets if they don't go along with them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Kapitol23 @Partisangirl How are they the bad guy when Syria screams for help against chemical weapons attacks and so the US (and allies) help them by taking out area where they are being made or carried?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@vzo1976 @LeeCamp @UN because they would love provocation to go after Israel directly. Other Middle Eastern countries will join in. There will be no more small wars. The next one will be the big one.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Commentator_PL @Israel @EmmanuelNahshon The so called concentration camp you speak of is ruled by Hamas. Talk to them about the rights and safety of their peoples.

<|startoftext|>Military grade weapons should never be made available to regular citizens &amp; all schools should have metal detectors at their entrances which would also help with knives &amp; such.

<|startoftext|>@Franklin_Graham I want to both say how very sorry I am for your father's loss, and for the despicable things some are saying.

<|startoftext|>Rest in peace #BillyGraham, and thank you for being a preacher who never once said he was perfect or made mistakes. There was only one perfect Man and you taught us all to put our trust and faith in Him. Rest now great disciple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well!  In closing, I'm beyond thrilled we have a Canadian girl in the top three after the short program in women's #figureskating #TeamCanada But great night for the women in general. Some strong performances! #Olympics<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@unrulyandrews lol! when my youngest was little and saw his Winter Olympics for the first time, he said he was going to be a moguls skier and practiced doing them off the ottoman whenever the competition was shown, lol It was hilarious!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This Russian skater's dress is beautiful and perfect for her music choice. Classic Russian style and elegant ferocity. #Olympics #figureskating<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jock_Dock I completely agree. It would be great to showcase some of the talent that, realistically, we've always had. Would love to see a Tragically Hip medley! They even have some great instrumental stuff. The piece the wrote for @KurtBrowning one time is amazing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just don't think you can beat Korean and Japanese artistry in woman's figure skating right now. Such grace and elegance. And amazing control over the elements! #figureskating  #Olympics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jock_Dock As a Kingstonian, I would have approved of this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is it with Carmen this year.... I have to admit, I'm done with it at this point.   #Olympics  #toomuch  #figureskating<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@edunkel I've noticed too! It's very striking!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Canada girl! Come on! #Olympics üá®üá¶<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neelsoman lol She actually did! That girl may land a quad some day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@3m1lyAndrews I know.  It's like the whole world takes a break.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So classic and elegant!  Beautifully done Japan!  And pretty dress too!  #FigureSkating #Olympics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anyone else feel super lazy and that they are a huge under-achiever every time they watch the  #Olympics or is it just me and my ass that's planted on the couch for an Olympic record number of hours?

<|startoftext|>@TNtales Yes, I am old enough to remember, lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some really beautiful skating dresses this  #Olympics. So pretty and classical, highlighting the femininity and elegance of women's skating &lt;3 #figureskating<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any #figureskating fan who is my age will understand this - It's nice to see so many countries represented and achieving things at the  #Olympics now that skating has a fair &amp; transparent judging system. It's been a long time coming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cordemps Push through it.  It's your own olympic performance!   #YouCanDoIt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So glad I don't have to listen to Tara and Johnny while watching #figureSkating . Reading what people are tweeting about them is bad enough. Glad @CBCOlympics stayed with class for commentating. #Olympics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If ACDC doesn't get you pumped for your skating performance, nothing will.  #Olympics #figureskating<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes! @CBCOlympics talking about @Lizmanley88 !  #Olympics #FigureSkatingI remember those games so well. #Calgary üá®üá¶<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shocked that our women's curling team won't be medalling at these games. It's easy to take it for granted since we have since 1998. Must be heartbreaking for them. #Olympics #Curling üá®üá¶<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ted_Wyman Seriously? I had turned it to figure skating. I guess I just take it for granted we would win, lol  https://t.co/vBuCzYZyj5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jestingjeffrey It's been common for years because of the popularity of the musical score of the film.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@loricreech @CBCOlympics @nbc It's a collaboration with Sportsnet and TSN, so figure skating and skiing is also on if you have those channels<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, haven't paid much attention to the women's skating for a while. Just found out the goth girl is Canadian!  #Olympics lol #figureskating<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A little behind because I had to pause. Watching goth girl now.  #Olympics #figureskating<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBCOlympics  you better never stop having @KurtBrowning as a #figureskating commentator the way @NBCOlympics ditched Scotty Hamilton ok?   #Olympics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't wait to see the goth girl skate. She's the angriest looking figure skater I've ever seen!  #figureskating #Olympics<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DianeHauschildt @unscriptedmike @POTUS Actually she wasn't. The voting system wasn't rigged by the Russians. Americans voted and as per the process Trump was elected.

<|startoftext|>If you're having problems w/your child, look for agencies to help. Being an active parent may not only save their lives, but others' lives as well.  Praying for the lives that were lost today &amp; the family/friends who are grieving them. May God be ever-present. #Parkland #Florida<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please, as parents, be involved in your kid's life, stay involved in your kid's life and always pay attention to their behavior and mood changes and what they are into.

<|startoftext|>@Mcfarmswife I think it's so difficult for me to understand because myself and my husband are very much involved with our kids lives. I can't see how a parent could not see warning flags unless they weren't close with their child. But maybe they tried and there is a broader issue (c)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>- Nikolas Cruz - 19 years old - used AR-15 firearm - previous student - history of disciplinary issues/suspension/expelled - 17 dead, possibly 14 or more injured #Parkland #Florida #Shooting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realityblow If the heart has changed, should the laws reflect that? Is there no room for compromise?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, there is another issue with these shootings in the high schools. How much mental health awareness and support does the education system have? Why do these kids have so much hate and violence in them? Why do they feel there is no other choice than to kill? #Parkland #Florida<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm a conservative Christian Canadian &amp; it astonishes me that so many conservative "Christian" Americans are against simple gun laws. Come to a compromise at least!

<|startoftext|>@LaurenNickols Mine too! I'm also a Star Trek fan and to me, Atlantis embodies a lot of ST series' characteristics. Some Star Wars as well. It's entirely underrated when it comes to overall sci-fi tv!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurenNickols I have the dvd's. Got all of them at a used dvd/cd shop. Each one under $10 cdn. :) I can watch it whenever I want forever, lol &lt;3  (And pause on Sheppard as much as I want...)  https://t.co/RJOFAXNq4s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurenNickols I loved it right off the bat as well. Besides having a crush on Sheppard (lol), all the characters are so charismatic. Great chemistry between the actors. It isn't overly militaristic....there's more sci-fi imagination and fun in it. I wish it lasted longer than the 5 seasons :(<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheFrankOzJam What I loved about the Muppet Show when I was a kid was that my dad loved it as much as I did. He made sure I had the album and made tapes for me and everything. It was an amazing family series back then and I'm hoping to buy the dvd collection &lt;3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watched the "Unbroken" sports doc on @markmcmorris with my 14 yr old son. SO inspiring &amp; I'm convinced Mark is the most canadian Canadian there is, lol.

The enemy is the hatred we possess &amp; throw at each other every time we're "triggered" or don't get our way. Be better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why am I not watching the #GRAMMYs ? Cause if they're going to talk about #MeToo &amp; #TimesUp while half dressed, celebrating a lot of music who's lyrics &amp; videos promote the objectification of women &amp; promiscuity I'm gonna lose it! As women we need empowerment w/o the use of sex.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cathygonzy97 @ynkutner @heydarn_010 @GalGadot @TobyLevyShoah 3,840 Gazans were treated in Israel in 2013. Do you know why?

<|startoftext|>Which was one of the reasons it was successful. It would be smarter to build upon that success rather to re-do it, perhaps by highlighting the next generation (the characters' children) &amp; using them to promote healthy relationships each gender wishes to seek with one another.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I also think that in light of the world today, rather than create a feminist approach to a program, it's more important than ever to highlight healthy relationships between men &amp; women, built on equality, mutual respect &amp; understanding.

<|startoftext|>@fandom_ly @m_t_baltimore @lisabillmatt @XFilesNews @GillianA She would have read at least a rough draft of each script well before each shooting, and I would go so far as to say she probably had lots of conversations with Chris &amp; others about the arc of the season in general before deciding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trentontess @XFilesRevival @thexfiles lol  I know, but I choose to believe the truth is still out there ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trentontess @XFilesRevival @thexfiles But was it the truth? CSM has been using words to manipulate people from the very beginning, especially Skinner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@m_t_baltimore @lisabillmatt @XFilesNews I don't maliciously pick apart a science fiction television show or label people with the ease of others I guess. It's a storyline we disagree with each other about, nothing more than that. Where you see misogamy I see a strong female heroine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@XFilesNews Power yes, but I don't believe absolute power. Not when a show hinges on the importance of it's main characters the way this one does. The introduction of the young agents failed last season. Chris knows he needs to keep David &amp; Gillian happy. Especially with how busy she is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@catdoesitbetter CSM has a history of using lies to manipulate those around him, especially Skinner right from the start of the show. There is still hope. Remember, the truth is out there...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@XFilesNews As a woman I didn't see it that way at all, or expect anything different knowing the history of the show &amp; mystery surrounding her pregnancy. Gender is inconsequential w/the exception that only she was able to bring an alien hybrid child into the world with influence on events.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@m_t_baltimore @lisabillmatt @XFilesNews If you're getting wrapped up in Scully's impregnation; how it did or didn't happen, you're missing the entire point of the show &amp; have a misunderstanding on what they are planning to do with her character. She has essentially been chosen to save humanity due to her circumstances.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@m_t_baltimore @XFilesNews X-Files fans know that not everything seen and heard on the show is necessarily as it seems, which is why it's so great. It's called effective storytelling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@XFilesNews I agree. What happened to get her to this point, and is there a possibility that she is actually a plant to spy on the CSM for someone else....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@red2007 @XFilesNews done due to her unique set of circumstances and the child she gave birth to. There is still so much about this story to unfold.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@red2007 @XFilesNews Her storyline is actually incredible. We all new she was impregnated somehow, just not the exact circumstances. CSM could be lying to manipulate Skinner as he always does. And it's easy to see that Scully is essentially going to be the savior of humanity when all is said and  (c)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@XFilesNews @thexfiles fans up to speed not only from season 10, but from circumstances from many other seasons as well. No an easy feat considering how long the show ran and how many micro storylines it carried along the way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@XFilesNews It's a different format now, with only 10 episodes yet it is still @TheXfiles, which rarely led to anything regarding the conspiracy stuff being fully explained in a season, let alone an episode. I think they did as good of a job as could be expected trying to get old and new (c)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SJWs who obviously have no idea what #TheXFiles is or has ever been about and are trying to tear the new episode apart on twitter... Seriously, let the rest of us who actually understand it enjoy ourselves.  https://t.co/YQogqlfeht<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GillianA @FOXTV It was awesome, especially with a great #XFiles twist at the end! Is it a lie? Is the truth still out there? I've been a fan since the very beginning. Great stuff! Congrats to you all!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MitchPileggi1 Loved seeing my Skinner again! &lt;3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SSnatter Thank you! Longtime fans are used to being put through this for years!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katyazeisig Scully being impregnated has always been on the table, so any fan should know this isn't a surprise that CSM would use it to get what he wants. It's the perfect storm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This backlash against the big reveal - #TheXFiles is based on government conspiracies &amp; how Mulder/Scully are manipulated against finding the truth. Her possibly being impregnated w/CSM's DNA mixed w/alien DNA aligns perfectly w/the show's purpose. The truth is still out there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmandaSparks19 That's what made it great....and as usual, as per #XFiles , no one knows what to believe. Lies? Truths? They are circumstantial in accordance to each character's will.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just want to thank Chris Carter, @davidduchovny, @GillianA and my sweet @MitchPileggi1 for bringing #TheXFiles back to us, and with such authority! Great stuff! @thexfiles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After being a fan of #TheXFiles since the beginning, I've come to learn the CSM will lie to get what he wants. And so I choose to believe he is not really William's father.  He's manipulating Skinner as he has done so many times before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxyFoxMulder Yes please @davidduchovny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will always believe in #TheXFiles  https://t.co/6cKuGqsgOc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Skinner - Who's the father? CSM - I am. The world.... #TheXFiles  https://t.co/bsJ3gC7PAx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We all know by now when Skinner says to leave it alone, it probably needs to not be left alone.... lol #TheXFiles @MitchPileggi1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man, Scully can't catch a break in this episode, lol #TheXFiles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Considering Barabara Hershey was obsessed with the antichrist a little while ago ( #Damien ), I can't see her being on #TheXFiles a good thing....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@samueljbell92 @XFilesRevival Oh gosh yes! For sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GillianA @FOXTV Please don't leave #TheXFiles Gillian. The television world needs Mulder AND Scully now more than ever. The truth is still out there along with many more to be found.... 10 episodes a year for a few more years? &lt;3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, I'm actually sick, and have a medium sized migraine, but short of hospitalization due to coma, I'm not missing #TheXFiles tonight. Resting with gingerale in the dark till then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@XFilesRevival CSM, conspiracies, scientific exploration and technology, mutants and mutations, internet hacking, William, dangerous truths and of course more @MitchPileggi1 . Please keep #XFiles going for a few more seasons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The material that is out there now is astounding; greater technology, larger internet, smaller world, multiple governments conspiracies/corruption/collusion, scientific growth. Virtual breeding ground for Mulder&amp;Scully&amp;Skinner. #XFiles @GillianA @davidduchovny @MitchPileggi1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In regards to @GillianA leaving after this season, I simply ask, why? We're in a time when series' can have 10 episodes a season every year or so, leaving actors to do other projects. Please keep #XFiles going a little longer.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ThePunisher @netflix TY for the focus on vets in season 1 of #ThePunisher .

<|startoftext|>@fidgetspinning1   https://t.co/BIVYzEe6Qd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DragonflyJonez Honestly, that's not what it's about. There is a depth to it. What broke him and why. Where did it all start. Who was involved. He's in conflict with himself. And the focus on vets post war is heartbreakingly sincere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nathalynaps It's better than you want it to be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ddivalicious3 It's amazing. Much more than  a guy shooting up people. In depth look at the character and what really happened to his family and why.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@w74830519 @netflix I love it! The depth into Frank's character, the focus on what the war does to vets, the government corruption &amp; conspiracy element that goes beyond those who assassinated his family, tender moments with Karen. Just awesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThePunisher is amazing. Love the depth into Frank's character &amp; past, the reality of war's effect on vets &amp; the corruption element. @jonnybernthal is absolutely incredible.

<|startoftext|>Seriously @ThePunisher series, wth are you doing, making me drown in such a vast ocean of feels?! This better be everything this season because it is everything to me! @jonnybernthal is killing me here! #KastleLove @DeborahAnnWoll  https://t.co/OkziI8eJIn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShaunGunner Because Tolkien fans crave quality over quantity. And with what Star Wars (Disney) has churned out lately, Tolkien fans have reason to worry. Maybe if JJ Abrams stays out of the LOTR tv series... ;)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gabilou811 @CraigSemon @_DeadMike_ @WilliamShatner @startrekcbs I'm a woman &amp; I didn't like it. Quality has nothing to do with the gender of the cast &amp; everything to do with the writing/acting/directing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StarTrek feel the need to watch more which is good because I'd never pay for access anyways. Trek is usually available to all. #StarTrekDiscovery<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@calantoni92 @NHC_Atlantic Not yet. But now that the eye is off Cuba and replacing itself, it will become more intense again. And the gulf water is extremely warm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@calantoni92 @NHC_Atlantic It's a tough job. They can only do what they can. But if the eye stays offshore, it will only get stronger by the time it hits.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Mcfarmswife with their choice of cast. Euron's character change is the absolute worst though. He's a very smart, charming, cunning dynamic character in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mcfarmswife I honestly think with this show, reading the books afterwards is a good thing. Other than age changes they did do a relatively great job<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mcfarmswife There are a ton of plots to choose from taking place in the books w/ a ton of characters. I just hate how sensationalized HBO has made it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mcfarmswife It's beyond fixing at this point. Funny thing is it's not even about not having anymore source material. It's just bad management of plots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imcorinnemec That is awesome.  Family is everything &lt;3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still reeling after 1 of the worst @GameOfThrones episodes ever last night. Butchering of my beloved books. Bad writing, directing &amp; acting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imcorinnemec I think I'm what you'd call a wussy coffee drinker. I have to have French Vanilla International Delight or FV Coffeemate in it to drink it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imcorinnemec   https://t.co/np6mT2opeQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mcfarmswife Possibly the /only/ best best of that episode, lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ongoing basement flooding with a migraine is tremendously stressful. #HeavyRain #OntarioWeather<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nicely done!  https://t.co/Iir8EZfaZn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Nymeria is going to keep an eye on Arya during her journey home &amp; will devour the first person who messes with her. #GameOfThrones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EddDoloroso And lots of mistakes as well. One example: Sam told Stannis about the Dragonglass when he was at Castle Black.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EddDoloroso being wasted on pointless scenes just to give minor characters some screen time. The poop montage last epi, Missandei/GW this epi. Just bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EddDoloroso Bran returns, he technically, as Ned's eldest (trueborn) son would be the true Lord. But yes, everything is a mess. And a lot of time is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EddDoloroso Due to the conflict I've read &amp; watched about whether the females can become wardens in ASOIAF, I kind of see why Jon was chosen. But when<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't wait for @sweetrobin9000  to attempt to comment on this episode. I need the of therapy after suffering through it.  #GameOfThrones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EddDoloroso I keep watching because I finish what I start, but I seriously need TWOW to come out to make the pain go away. @GRRMspeaking #GameOfThrones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Missandei/GW sex, Jorah's greyscale... Too much time on directionless storylines when only 5 episodes are left this season! #GameOfThrones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least the wreck they've made of the sandsnakes is finally over. But seriously, this is not the same show it was. #GameOfThrones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Other than Nymeria with Arya, this has to be the worst written, directed &amp; even acted episode of #GameOfThrones to date.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vkcoleartist @GameOfThrones In front of his mother's statue! This is why I'm stoked! #WhyAreTheyInTheCrypts<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WatchersOTWall @GameOfThrones Winter came last night and everyone watched it's storm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let me just put something out there. I am sick of the female/male - power/leading character talk. If the actor fits the part, then use them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyoubChrissy Pretty sure the Dragonbinder is coming into the red Keep though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyoubChrissy It's actually sickening how much they've destroyed his character on the show. Such a smart, intriguing, worldly character in the books.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've said it often. Find this show and watch it in it's entirety. You won't be disappointed. Very Sherlock Holmes-esque, but grittier. #TV  https://t.co/mB8HK5Z8qr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pedophilia is not a joke. If R. Kelly has a longstanding attraction to underage girls, he needs some serious help, not a record label.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imcorinnemec Because I just want to make you smile, all the time. Much love to you hun.  https://t.co/QbOgax2llE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One more thing. I miss the written elegance the show had in the beginning. It was more than cheap one-liners. #GoTS7 I miss @GRRMspeaking .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Non-book readers: Know the show completely ruined the Euron. He's not a thug. He's a knowledgeable traveler &amp; master manipulator. #GoTS7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imcorinnemec @GameOfThrones I had NO idea you were a watcher! Have you read the books?  I'm definitely more of a fan of them but the show has some great visualization.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And how does she have any support of KL? She blew up their Sept! The city should be in full revolt &amp; she hasn't got much of an army! #GoTS7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the show is doing w/Cersei/Jaime is completely baffling me. In the books her kids were EVERYTHING &amp; Jaime can't stand her. #GoTS7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too much time was spent w/ the chamber pots &amp; such w/Sam. Was funny at 1st but time could have been used for more important scenes.  #GoTS7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I truly wish D&amp;D &amp; @HBO had the reg 10 episodes these last 2 seasons. Too many important things are missing/changed from the books. #GoTS7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't wait for @sweetrobin9000 Preston's analogy of this 1st episode. "What You Are Missing" is now "What Is Totally Against Canon" #GoTS7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lyanna Mormont, kicking ass and taking men's names for 10 years. There is such an adorableness to this.  #GoTS7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I also think Sansa's going to screw some stuff up while Jon goes north and south. D&amp;D have made her power hungry.  #GoTS7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see Alys Karstark marrying a wildling to secure the allegiance of her castle. For canon's sake please! *book thing cough cough*  #GoTS7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The episode also needed more Tormund and Brienne, because I'm a sucker for their facial expressions. #GoTS7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And for the record, Jon was right about the Houses staying with their longstanding families. Ned would have done the same. #GoTS7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1st episode needed more Jon, but I know he'll be going to beg Dany for some dragon glass soon. Maybe a dragon too when he sees one.  #GoTS7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think they're overdoing it w/ the massive shift in Sansa's character. But I'm ASOIAF lover so the whole thing is pretty off for me. #GoTS7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Arya is going south, then there won't be a sibling reunion. But promos show her in snow, so, maybe she changes her mind? #GoTS7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Arya one-shot-ing the Freys was a pretty great thing to see. Winter came and left no man alive.  #GoTS7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like the Dragonbinder horn is going to come into play after all.... At least something about Euron will be right.  #GoTS7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love the humanity The Hound is showing. Though I hope it ends when and if CLEGANEBOWL happens! #GoTS7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want a Nymeria and Arya reunion. I want to start seeing Ghost with Jon again. BRING BACK THE WOLVES!  #GoTS7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good episode to start. Still getting further from original canon which is annoying. The show's Euron really sucks. He's not a thug!  #GoTS7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCWorld I didn't think I'd see anything more vain and ridiculous than her maternity pic. Clearly I was wrong. #OverTheTop #EnoughAlready<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#syriaairstrikes are needed not just by the U.S, but by more leaders, targetting all military airfields known to carry out chemical attacks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The @UN has let Assad continue to bombard his people with chemical warfare, regardless of such attacks being banned internationally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The U.S did what the @UN should have put a coalition together to do in 2013, but the @UN is bought by China &amp; Russia. #SyriaStrikes<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@XIBASH A chemical warfare base was targeted in response to the Syrian government using it to gas their people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN You should change your headline from "Syria" to "Syrian Chemical Warfare Base." Much more accurate considering this is to save people!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Great @ColonyUSA tonight, as it is every week. If you aren't watching this show you are missing out on some great stories &amp; stellar acting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrekMovie I actually looked at this episode differently, citing the unfortunate results of a genderless society, where no line is drawn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish people were as concerned about the lives of unborn human babies as much as they are about unborn giraffe babies.  #AprilTheGiraffe<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Mcfarmswife @PatriciaHeaton I think at this point, that would cause an even greater riot than the ones we've been seeing, lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WalkingDead_AMC Spencer is an ass. I would have donated him while they were taking everything. For batting practice....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheTFreddy I haven't seen the latest episode. I am finding the constant f-bombs really distracting. Still on the fence in general.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mcfarmswife @PatriciaHeaton That, they are saving for the season finale.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JDMorgan I've found the words "quiet" and "Negan" don't go go well together. That psycho really loves the sound of his own voice ;)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#TWD made me one of "the commercially dead" tonight. So many kind of hurt the flow of the show. Still great episode though. #TheWalkingDead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think we can all agree, Spencer has to go. I volunteer him for batting practice. "Get a free Spencer with every can of peas!" #TWD #ByeBye<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll say it again &amp; again. @JDMorgan: an incredible actor portraying an incredible character. Fascinating to watch! #TheWalkingDead #Negan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I called it during the premiere and tonight's episode only increased my belief. Carl will be the one to kill Negan. #TheWalkingDead #TWD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I still think Judith is Rick's. It's not common for two black haired people like Lori and Shane to have a blonde child. #TheWalkingDead #TWD<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BryanFuller You aren't getting my point. Your Pres. is doing his best to create peace. It's SO important rn. Use your fame to do the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Celebrities need to rise above the hate or keep quiet. Stop enflaming an already hostile situation. Use your fame for peace. #Trump #Fear<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BryanFuller This has to stop, really. Nothing's going to happen to gays. It's just enflaming an already hostile situation. Rise above.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@samanthajferris I disagree. A black President for 8 years. Hillary didn't get enough women votes because women didn't want her for the job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And if you are saying your kids cried about the results think of what you told them to get them that upset. #Trump #President #BePositive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The media, Obama &amp; others painted Trump as SUCH a villian that now people are terrified. Dems are responsible for this reaction! #Election<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Does anyone know if it looks like a third party will get enough to become more viable in the next election? Is it 5%? #ElectionNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notlaurel They did, voting for Bernie, but the DNC made sure he wasn't the option going forward.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kalpenn @BrandonJRouth You all also need to respect that there are people who felt that HRC wasn't going to work for them. A lot of people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TahmohPenikett feels to be disenfranchised by the establishmment. Voting for people who never speak for me, my family or our difficulties.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TahmohPenikett See, I don't think this is bad or good. It just is. Does anyone know what he'll be like for sure? IDK. I do know how it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notlaurel Yes, and the majority of the people don't want Hillary to decide who they should be. Again, democracy at work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A democracy recognizes everyone's vote! People vote based on their life, beliefs &amp; needs. 3rd party voting rights R included! #ElectionNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Celebrities bashing voters who didn't vote their way are disgusting! All about democracy until you are disagreed with!  #ElectionNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JewelStaite That's a disappointing statement. People have the right to vote for the platform they believe will work for them. Democracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notlaurel Every election is crucial. People have the right 2 vote for the platform they think works for them. Doesn't matter if U disagree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not fair for Dems to curse people who didn't vote for a Dem leader they don't trust &amp; doesn't speak for them! #ElectionNight #Hillary<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>could walk away. No one needs to die. No one needs to keep a baby that wasn't wanted. Both human rights respected. @IMKristenBell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IMKristenBell So I really have a hard time processing in particular, 2nd &amp; 3rd trimester abortions. The baby could be saved &amp; the woman<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IMKristenBell I do understand that, but babies are born premature everyday w/ people fighting to save them indicating their life matters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IMKristenBell I admire your passion, I just can't see how one human's rights are more important than another, male/female or baby/adult.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IMKristenBell Is there a difference between a baby 7 months in the womb who could possibly be saved &amp; newborn who is given up for adoption?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IMKristenBell I don't understand. Why can't women AND unborn babies have rights? You've had life grow inside you. Isn't all life precious?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Edcarrera The FLOTUS speech got me thinking about it. Her &amp; POTUS invite rap &amp; hip hop artists to the WH who always degrade women! #debate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love how people who are complaining about sexist comments about women support hip hop/rap songs &amp; videos that degrade women! #debatenight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think this gif sums up America's choices perfectly. Inexperienced egomaniac vs dishonest desperation. #debatenight #NeverEitherOne  https://t.co/IkR8aMVy9j<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will never understood a woman who's felt life grow in her for 9 months wouldn't save BOTH mother AND baby. #debatenight @HillaryClinton<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well once again, I think it's pretty clear that the U.S needs a strong 3rd party voted in. Neither candidate would get my vote. #debatenight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glennbeck As a Canadian, trust me...Justin Trudeau is not any better. He's a kid in it for the worldwide social perks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnneBayefsky @HillaryClinton They are, just mostly on the opposite side, lol!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@moongawdez I just can't see why women AND unborn children can't have rights. It's not rocket science. Attempt to save both. #debatenight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In all actuality neither candidate is fit for the presidency, due to lack of experience, or too much desperation &amp; dishonesty #debatenight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wasn't the head of the DNC fired for trying to rig the election? #debatenight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What bothers me most about Hillary is her coming off like she is entitled the presidency after losing to Obama. Why so desperate? #debate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Donald was to win would Hillary concede and support? üòÑ I can't see either of them taking it well on the others' win. #debatenight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally a good and fair moderator in Chris Wallace. Glad someone is finally not kissing Hillary's butt. #debate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@H_Combs I just don't understand why the baby can't be saved as well as the mother during pregnancy complications. Rights to both beings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlbertBrooks @se4realhinton It's simple. If the baby must come early to save the mother, attempt 2 save the baby too. Rights of both saved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dis-allowing late term abortions isn't against women's rights/health. If the baby must be born early, try to save it. #debatenight #Hillary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the government shouldn't stand up for unborn babies, who will? If the baby must come early, try to save it! #debatenight @HillaryClinton<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hillary, no, it was part of Obama's campaign promise; to get out of Iraq as soon as possible. Remember? You ran against him? #debatenight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, take the oil and they have no funds. I said that at the beginning. #debatenight<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Is Lester still there? Or did he quit? #debatenight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Hillary stopped sucking up to different groups, whether it be races, the poor, women etc, I might take her more seriously. #debatenight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not with either of them but I've never felt someone to be so fake and power-hungry as I feel Hillary is.  #debatenight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep, 6 trillion and nothing to show for it and a country that is falling apart. This is true. #debatenight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He is getting under her skin.... Haha! How about both of them cough up what they are hiding and people can get some truths. #debatenight<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What's happening to Trump tonight. #GOPDebate  https://t.co/xKNtnQqtWq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GOPDebate As President you will be privy to information you didn't have when running &amp; therefore will have to be flexible and/or negotiate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Politicians accusing other politicians of being liars/not doing the things they said they'd do when elected. lol That's what politicians do!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bartongellman Yes.  It will be like this  https://t.co/rIipmhznF2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Waiting for the #GOPDebate to turn into this...  You know it's coming. #Fox  https://t.co/dhkC82Td12<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ErinBurnett @CNN Ask the @GOP why they want Romney over Cruz too? Why aren't they pushing for Cruz to be the nom as he's 2nd in delegates.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Stay calm, stay focused, stay pleasant. Aim to win the undecided voters with answers to their problems. #GOPdebate @GOP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If they were smart, the'yd be supporting &amp; working out a Trump/Cruz ticket. It's about who can beat Hillary, not beating each other! #GOP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is about one thing - control. The @GOP want a candidate they can buy &amp; use if elected. Trump is self-funded &amp; won't answer to them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Regardless which party you support, I would be pissed if my party implemented their own agenda. This is why politicians aren't trusted! #GOP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So let me get this straight. Majority of people in many States vote for Trump. Cruz is second &amp; @GOP wants to shun voters &amp; buy Romney in?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GameOfThrones @hbonow I've already been re-watching, lol.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@davidjones720 @TheRightScoop He was pretty specific when saying they provide good healthcare but won't be funded if performing abortions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think there might actually be a fight on @CNN ! LOL #SuperTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedcruz I believe @realdonaldtrump said he supports the woman's healthcare by PP, as long as they don't include abortions. #SuperTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow, @realdonaldtrump did very well in his press conference. Much more controlled &amp; polite than we've ever seen him before. #SuperTuesday<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The #oscars never agree with the general public about what makes a great movie. Backdoor deals &amp; corruption at its finest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Star Wars should get sound editing/mixing, &amp; of course it doesn't. &amp; no costume, no make up. Plenty of favortism though. #Ridiculous #Oscars<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LVormbrock It won't. Its too scifi. They don't even win for costume and make up ffs üòí Its sickening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad The Revenant won for Cinematography. It seems like a visually breathtaking movie. #Oscars<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is absolutely nothing thats appealing about Mad Max for me. And I have no idea why it has won the awards it has over others. #Oscars<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Revenant is getting pommeled by Mad Max. #Oscars<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MsDarcyFarrow @thexfiles @ekovisions @skye2earth I hope there will be more to redeem it. 10 episodes a season type, like other series'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MsDarcyFarrow @ekovisions @skye2earth My hope was these 6 episodes would be more about "The Truth" &amp; new phenomena today. @thexfiles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ekovisions @MsDarcyFarrow @skye2earth They had an opportunity, making the two Arab guys innocent victims rather than the terrorists.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NickNicotera @RobbieAmell He was fantastic :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In conclusion, tonight's episode was not indicative enough of @thexfiles to have in a limited 6 episodes. Still looking for "The truth."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobbieAmell Hope you aren't getting lots of hate. Fans can be a little too paranoid when it comes to their Mulder &amp; Scully. You were great!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haha! Love this!!!   https://t.co/V83Qezetoz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok. So it was an ok episode if it was part of a normal 23 episode season. But only given 6? We wanted more of the @theXFiles basics covered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For people new to the #XFiles, its not always about monsters &amp; aliens. ESP, mysteries of the brain...thats part of it too. Always has been.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I belong with you. You belong with me...." Mulder/David &amp; Scully/Gillian right there! They will always belong on #XFiles together! &lt;3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously, Miller is very cool in this episode. @robbieamell is blowing it out of the water for me. I'd love to see more of him in #XFiles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I seriously love Skinner/ @mitchpileggi1 &amp; really wished he was used more in this 6 episode reboot. #XFiles Same with @William_B_Davis /CSM<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Mulder makes a damn sexy cowboy! lol #XFiles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow...as a Canadian I'm thinking this episode is really making a lot of Americans look bad... #XFiles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm liking @robbieamell in this episode. I've only ever scene him in comic book themed shows. He can really act the Agent part! #XFiles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't think now was the best time for a terrorist themed episode... But I am loving Mulders thoughts and words as usual. #XFiles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheXFiles People will not accept a Mulder and Scully-esque remake. You can't copy perfection. I hope this isn't a backdoor pilot. #XFiles<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jarpad @jensenackles The brotherly bonding was classic tonight. Very honest &amp; heartfelt. So good too see in the show again! @thejimmichaels<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That #Supernatural episode was awesome &amp; flawless! Felt reminiscent of the first few seasons &amp; the writing was superb! Great bro bonding! &lt;3<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@APushka It's like they have the judge and jury mentality down there. Seems they need some new country wide psychological police training.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a Canadian, why do many U.S policemen not have the ability to show restraint &amp; only shoot to incapacitate? #NewTraining #LaquanMcDonald<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@APushka Yes! Our cops communicate a lot differently. They go in soft, attempting to de-escalate; caring for the safety of all involved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@APushka Fellow Canadian here. Exactly. Shoot to incapacitate, not kill.  We are so blessed to have the police that we do.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AvengersAriana What are your feelings about nearly all of the Arab countries not welcoming refugees? I can't get over how strange that is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AvengersAriana We can only hope that is the case....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AvengersAriana I've seen masses come off boats and trains into Europe on the net. I wish there were more women &amp; children, I really do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AvengersAriana I think the best compromise, one that will make people feel safer is to let women &amp; children in. They need the most help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dubhe0ne @BSfromPS Prayers to both of you.  God bless!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AvengersAriana There are many statistic sites with different ones, but the majority show between 65-75% young men. But as I said,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dubhe0ne @BSfromPS I was just using a term of endearment the same as she was.  I thought we were bonding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AvengersAriana  https://t.co/6hjcxZR4BV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BSfromPS @dubhe0ne Wow, you are as far left to the left as you can get. That's where the insulting nature comes from I see. Praying for U:)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BSfromPS @dubhe0ne You are the one spouting all the different terrorists around the world. These two Chechen refugees you missed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dubhe0ne @BSfromPS Was the orginal topic NOT refugees? I'm sorry, I thought it was the topic of your original post hunny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AvengersAriana The way to protect countries from the majority of male generated terrorist threats are to accept only women &amp; children.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BSfromPS I was sure we were talking about the refugee crisis going on right now in the world...are we changing to skinheads?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BSfromPS  https://t.co/6hjcxZR4BV All it takes is one, or at least 8 in Paris.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BSfromPS Does that include your Boston Bombers?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BSfromPS I'm actually into statistics sweetie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kkalmes2 @GovChristie @ChrisChristie Actually at least 73% of refugees are young men, not women &amp; children. Why all the men?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AvengersAriana Over 73% of the refugees are young men. Why is that? Where are the women &amp; children? Pushed aside by men leaving? Why?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BSfromPS At least 73% of refugees are young men, and look at that photo? Why so few women &amp; children? Why have the men pushed them aside?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndePenny @PaladinCornelia Help the women and children. Lessen the threat. Then youv'e helped, AND taken some steps for self protection.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndePenny @PaladinCornelia And so are the facts. There is a mass gathering of ISIS recruits daily that are predominantly young men.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Letti4U @juniorovj What I wish was a consideration is just letting women &amp; children into countries. Any threat would be greatly lessened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juniorovj @Letti4U Already sent something to her. But thanks for your diligence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndePenny @PaladinCornelia Very true. That's why I say only let women &amp; children in. Majority of suicide bombers &amp; gunman are young men.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Letti4U @juniorovj Plus if you look at the photos of mass refugee movement it seems to validate the statistics. Mostly young men 18-30 yrs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Letti4U @juniorovj There are many with stats between 50-80% being men, but most hover between 70-78%.  https://t.co/6hjcxZR4BV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNNPolitics @LauraKoran Why don't you talk about why over 73% of refugees are young men, perhaps not unlike your Boston Bombers?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juniorovj @Letti4U Over 73% of refugees are healthy young men, not women &amp; children. Why are the men pushing the vulnerable aside to leave?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@karennaoner Why aren't a clear majority women &amp; children? Why did these healthy young men push them aside?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@karennaoner America is frightened of the statistic of most terrorists being young men &amp; over 73% of the refugees being young men like them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SassySenSanders I can't. Over 73% of them are men. Where are the women &amp; children who were pushed aside by the men? Why mainly young men?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BRios82 The reality is at least 73% of refugees are young men &amp; not women &amp; children. They were pushed aside by men. Why?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoungGoldy24K At least 73% of refugees are young men. Why did they push their women &amp; children aside? The vulnerable should be helped.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndePenny @PaladinCornelia If there are any concessions to be made, it should be only allowing women &amp; children in. The most vulnerable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SDCmike @TheGoldCheetah If only women &amp; children were accepted for now, that would ease many of the tensions. They are the most vulnerable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndePenny @PaladinCornelia What about the ones that are coming through via Mexico asking for asylum?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@roseperson Perhaps if women &amp; children made up a vast majority of the refugees. Instead at least 73% are healthy young men. Why? #refugees<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bj116 Perhaps if the majority of refugees were women&amp;children it would have helped. Instead at least 73% R young men who pushed them aside.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaladinCornelia Or people are wondering why at least 73% of refugees are young men &amp; why they bypassed women &amp; children to get out. #Syria<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1Marchella At least 73% of refugees are young men. Ask yourself where all the women &amp; children who really need help are?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheGoldCheetah That isn't true, or we'd be seeing a hell of a lot more of them in refugee photos. At least 73% of them are young men.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dpletka True, but look at the statistics. At least 73% of refugees are young men. Where are the women &amp; children that need real help?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBCNews @CTVNews @JustinTrudeau And if I'm not mistaken, aren't most terrorist gunman &amp; suicide bombers young men? #SyrianRefugees<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBCNews @CTVNews Ask @JustinTrudeau why at least 73% of refugees R young men. Where R the women &amp; children? Pushed aside? #SyrianRefugees<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN @BBCWorld Where are all the women and children who need help? Because they were pushed aside by these men THAT is why! #SyrianRefugees<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why aren't any of the news networks asking the question of why at least 73% of the refugees are strong &amp; healthy young men? @CNN @BBCWorld<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shypixel If the majority of the refugees were women &amp; children people would be better. But at least 73% are healthy young men. Why is that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GlobalPost You don't see many women &amp; children refugees do you? Try focusing on that. At least 73% are young men. Why??? #SyrianRefugees<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least 73% of the refugees are young men. As yourselves why that is. Stop letting them in &amp; accept only women &amp; children. #SyrianRefugees<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>-clouds Prime Minister we have, and I'm betting it's going to be a hell of a lot sooner than later.  @JustinTrudeau #Canada<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Let's take a moment and remember that at least 73% of #SyrianRefugees are young men. So maybe talk about only letting women and children in.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#minutedesilence is good, but think about WHY this happened. Think about people coming into your borders, unchecked. #jihad #ISIS #France<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ISIS is #Syria 's enemy! ISIS has their strongholds &amp; bases among civilians so when anyone retaliates, women &amp; children die. Educate!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you want to pray for #Syria fine, pray ISIS stops using Syrian people as human shields when countries retaliate. That's what's happening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@louiseberyllium So unfortunately when anyone goes after the terrorists bases, civilians will always get killed.  They are shields to ISIS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@louiseberyllium It's not that. This whole thing is awful, but that is why the terrorists do it. They care nothing for their people :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@louiseberyllium retaliate for ISIS attacks, the civilians get killed &amp; the media can post the pics to make the retaliating country look bad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@louiseberyllium The city they are bombing is a stronghold for ISIS. Terrorists purposely embed themselves with civilians so when countries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember, terrorists hide within city strongholds filled with civilians so that they are caught in the crossfire. BLAME #ISIS FOR #Syria<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@louiseberyllium ISIS started this war a long time ago. ISIS is hiding within a city of civilians as terrorists always do.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I have 2 give credit 2 @thecampaignbook &amp; friends. I get a migraine after watching movies/tv for 2 long. Can't imagine 3 days! #allmymovies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thecampaignbook Positive vibes 2 you during this. I can promise you, if you did this in Canada, you'd get nothing but love! #allmymovies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm actually concerned about his diet in there.  Someone take in a veggie tray or some fruit. lol  #ShiaLaBeouf #allmymovies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@josieroses @thecampaignbook He left just before the end of the last movie (Bobby). Then it was a break. Now the next movie has started.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm actually touched by the people reaching out to #ShiaLaBeouf in a positive way. No reason to hate. He's there. He's being cool. Enjoy it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lots of touchy-feely people in the theatre right now. Kind of creepy.... lol #ShiaLaBeouf #allmymovies<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_Marl_E I know right?  As if that would somehow ruin the strange fascination? lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @thecampaignbook did you consult with a doctor before doing this?  Should we try this at home?  #allmymovies #ShiaLaBeouf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Marl_E Do you happen to know what movie they are on at this point?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I wish I could say I liked the episode, but I can't. Too much family dysfunction &amp; not enough showing of society's break down. #FearTWD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kiddle I want to see the escalation of the virus &amp; break down of society and the family's reaction to that. Not high school drama.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@smashley_n @FearTWD I'm desensitized because of the horse scene in TWD. Knew it was coming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kiddle That was the best scene of the episode. Wish we could have seen more!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bastylefilegirl I thought the same thing. Guess it's more entertaining to knock over some scaffolding &amp; damage everyone's car but Travis's.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@liisa_ganley Yeah, I feel like I'm overdosing on dysfunction. They need to focus on the city's reaction and how it's escalating more.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Everything that has been seen, everything that they have been through and they get up the next morning and take out the trash? #FearTWD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the things that is really annoying me is their casting of adults as teens. And then they have them act like immature brats. #FearTWD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Massive rioting, looting, burning and chaos and Travis's truck is completely clean and untouched.  Really? #FearTWD<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Do you know how many people you could make happy by casting @BradleyJames in an awesome role by the end of the series? @GameOfThrones @HBO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is all I see when "Eye of the Tiger" is mentioned or played &amp; nothing will ever change that. @JensenAckles &lt;3  http://t.co/pdHYyJldIy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's a thought. UN, NATO &amp; what have you, being PROACTIVE &amp; settling what's happening in Syria so people won't flee. #refugees<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>They night as well say something to that effect. Jim Henson must be rolling in his grave.   https://t.co/SP8FlQdQG2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FTWDFans 2 reasons. People are comparing it to TWD too much. And people are forgetting it's a prequel and about the escalation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevo81989 Embarrassingly so.  As with all my other scifi/fantasy loves, lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Endan44 They don't believe what they are seeing. They still think the authorities will fix everything. They aren't thinking zombies yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WriteReason I think we will. Likely in TWD. You'd think the show would end with a cure. To get a cure they have to know what the cause was.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WriteReason Everyone does, lol.  The the producers said at SDCC that #FearTWD wasn't going to explain it yet either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JarrettSM It's just because of Labor Day Weekend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iKimee_ I know right?  Zombies can't swim. Unfortunately here in the middle of Canada water freezes and they could walk across. :'(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevo81989 have no idea what is going on, if it will last, or how what they are seeing is real.  They still trust authority &amp; government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevo81989 It's not perfect yet.  There are some character kinks I'd like to see fixed. I keep having to remind myself these characters (c)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelloAnjo That's always the tough thing about prequels. People know how bad it gets &amp; are used to it being that bad right away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevo81989 Lets just say it was much faster and a bit more intense this episode. Slow burn is speeding up...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SohnsTed Labor Day Weekend probs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevo81989 You'd be surprised....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelloAnjo  Not a hiatus. Labor Day Weekend holiday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmberRellim It's faster and a bit more intense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@silkysoul One theory is that it originated from the flu shot everyone gets all over the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@silkysoul It's supposed to be worldwide, just showing the growth &amp; consequences in these cities/states. The why is still unknown to all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LadyStar_62 People are too caught up in TWD and aren't appreciating that this is a prequel where chararacters have NO idea what's going on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think what people need to remember about #FearTWD is that these characters can't believe what they are seeing.  They can't process it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Elways7 Loved that part!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me: kids,if you're father &amp; I told you not to go outside because dead things were eating people, you'd listen right?  https://t.co/OVp8gjBB5E<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MySciFiFantasy what I'm seeing?"  It's hard to sit &amp; watch these people so slow to react. lol #FearTWD #WalkingDead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I keep trying to think, "ok if I didn't know what the hell was going on or what zombies were," wouldn't I have a hard time believing (c)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nerdist You've got two weeks to secure a #FearTheTalkingDead show contract!  Get on it @AMC_TV It's what your viewers want!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WriteReason The flu shot they wanted everyone to get is a theory.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wanted to see a child enter, and a zombie slide out. I know it doesn't work that fast, but it would've been cool!  https://t.co/JkyXusWEke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Way too many commercials.  https://t.co/lGLgPCrjaM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FearTWD That is because the flu shots may have been the trigger for the zombie infection.  Eh? Eh?  #GiveMeASignHere<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JennaLatrache parts of the country &amp; the rest of the world before all communication fails. Oh and government and scientific community too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JennaLatrache mentioned that maybe it has something to do with the flu shot everyone is getting. I am hoping for more mentioning of other<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JennaLatrache Unfortunately the producers said that the virus won't be explained, but there may be some theories played with. Someone here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JennaLatrache It was slower than I thought it would be. Now that the illustration of the family is done, it's focus is more on the virus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YamileTomlinson No problem hun :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alright new and old friends.  Time for me to embrace another part of my nerd/geek self and read some #GameOfThrones before sleeping. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JennaLatrache Too bad.  The last half hour was the best part and thrusts you into it more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nikkojames5881 @grimestrash It would be genius.  Humanity brought it upon themselves so to speak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grimestrash @nikkojames5881 Exactly, Rick woke up to a virus that was already running it's course. This is the beginning. It's growing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nikkojames5881 @grimestrash And we could be getting hints on the origin.  Someone gave the theory that it's to do with the flu shot!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jason_T_Buras I think people forgot that it's a prequel and about the escalation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@catrogue If zombies can ring doorbells we are really in trouble ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AZDrJML Wait for it...it peaks towards the end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People just don't get that this is a prequel and is about the escalation.  No one has patience anymore.  https://t.co/FXZ2b2VgxN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefSaavedra But that's the point of a prequel.  To pay attention and see if there are some answers hidden as you watch the progression.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cassbsass have something to do with the flu shot everyone was getting....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cassbsass I'm really interested in the progression. It may give us some clues to the beginning. Though I've heard a great theory it might<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YamileTomlinson It's a prequel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wierdalexj I think he was before the end of the show, lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefSaavedra The producers said that question wouldn't be answered.  I've heard the theory that it could be to do with the flu shot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__IceBerg__  Gone to find 'fresh meat' I suppose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cassbsass Exactly, like for instance it's a prequel!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are waaaay too many #TWD fans who don't understand that this is a PREQUEL that is going to show the ESCALATION of zombies. #FearTWD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nerdtaculurr There's some good info in these scenes if U pay attention. Someone here mentioned that maybe the flu shot is how it all began.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well said!  https://t.co/U7jKCjbqcQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_its__gabzzz Honestly, just wait for it.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@animaniac23 Definitely some girl power there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TJN3 It's genius....the flu shot possibly bringing on the zombie apocalypse....lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Floresback Did he have his flu shot? ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TJN3 But I wonder...with the CDC having done tests and such, they would have noticed that trend right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TJN3 Just checked the interwebs, and yes she did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandyBuechele Especially when Stannis only had a daughter.... lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandyBuechele Wait what?  Who?!  I must see this! *searches the internet frantically*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TJN3 I thought about that too. I guess once she ran out of 'meat' she sniffed and followed to where she's find more?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ANTHONYBLOGAN I just read a theory from someone. They wonder if the virus has something to do with the flu shot everyone is getting. Nice!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SchokoDelphin Ooooh....now that is a great theory! I hadn't thought of that! @TJN3   https://t.co/STizOcFRbi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LOL  THIS!  https://t.co/Bv1cCd8QYl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TJN3 Well, just a different point of view, from a dysfunctional family that is in ground zero experiencing the escalation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ANTHONYBLOGAN But no one knows how it got into everyone's systems.  And the producers said neither show will answer that question yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ANTHONYBLOGAN Alright. A member of the CDC told Rick that they had found that everyone already has the virus in their systems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mskristalcooper Especially when you know your school has metal detectors, lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TJN3 characters wasn't one of those things.  It would be a great point of view.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TJN3 Yes.  I'd like to see how the governments, health care professionals and scientists dealt with it. Too bad one of the main<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ANTHONYBLOGAN It had kind of explained that in The Walking Dead.  Do you really want to know?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kevin0719 She is going to be amazing as this goes on.  She has the most natural acting ability.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TJN3 This show may also show a bit about how the CDC came to the realization that everyone has the virus in their bodies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GGQuiaroS and how the walkers were at the very beginning before they had time to deteriorate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GGQuiaroS They aren't changing facts.  They just aren't telling us the exact origin.  They're showing us what it was like when it started<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TJN3 Yeah, the producers said the show wasn't going to answer that question.  It kind of drives you crazy, lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GGQuiaroS Producers said they wouldn't look the same due to them being fresh and it's at the very beginning of the virus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I didn't know Obama was a high school principal in L.A. in his spare time.  #FearTWD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm now convinced that #FrankDillane is the secret son of #JohnnyDepp . The likeness is uncanny!  That kid is going to go places!  #FearTWD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Danielles2cents Wait for it.....it gets better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaelnooris @WalkingDead_AMC Absolutely.  That ending was classic Walking Dead!  Watching the escalation is going to be awesome!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaelnooris @WalkingDead_AMC long hiatuses and this fixes that.  The bonus is that it's a prequel and different from the original.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaelnooris @WalkingDead_AMC I believe that this show is actually going to be shown in the off season of TWD. People complain about the<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is exactly why people will be watching next week.  https://t.co/0s5Elf98eA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EmilioEmm lol  We all want answers! But I guess this is all we are going to get.  It would be nice to know what the heck it is though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmilioEmm Yes.In TWD it was thought that U would only be infected if you were bit or scratched, then they found out it's in people already.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmilioEmm The producers said that this new show isn't even going to answer those questions. It's just going to show the escalation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmilioEmm lol  Ok. The virus is already in people.  What no one knows is how did it get there &amp; and why all of a sudden it began.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmilioEmm Ohhh ok then.  Did you want the answer to your question?  I can tell you the answer if you want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amdvte #Nickspiration<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmilioEmm Have you seen The Walking Dead? It's been sort of explained, in a way, on there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DougGoodwin I know it was a bit slow, but if that had happened, what would be the point of a show about the escalation of the virus?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A bit 2 much character development 4 a premiere but it escalated nicely &amp; ended so you have to watch next week.#FearTWD #FearTheWalkingCal<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@timmhotep But historically accurate perhaps?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StanTheM4n I think the men around Dany were from Drogo's group, and I think Theon and Sansa jumped into a large snowbank.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_mikeburns @GameOfThrones It would have been the same punishment for a man.  It wasn't about her body, it was about shaming &amp; breaking her.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LAAVFC Very true :)  I'm off to sleep. It's 4am here! Yikes!  Good chatting with you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FarhannaOkhir Yes, even if it's just for the effects and the fast paced action. @TheRock was perfect for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LAAVFC I thought the Brits were the best part! And I'm Canadian so that's the truth! lol It was cool to see "Rickon" again! He did great!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LAAVFC I even giggled a couple of times.  That isn't normal for a disaster movie, lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have to say it, @TheRock was born to be a disaster movie hero.  Of that there is no doubt! @SanAndreasMovie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LAAVFC I agree.  I was hoping for a bit stronger and more realistic character plot and more focus on the population.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BowsOnTheRight @ColtonLHaynes Unfortunately he's only in a small portion at the very beginning. But he did good! lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FarhannaOkhir I wouldn't say it would be a complete waste of money. The special effects are amazing.  I'm probably just picky, lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nameislea See, and to me it didn't pull me in at all.  It looked mostly 2D.  I've heard the Imax 3D was better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FarhannaOkhir Not :(  Disappointed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nameislea Really?  It was only available in 3D here.  You didn't miss much at all. Barely noticed :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeipTheHype97 That is exactly what I would have rated it for sure! I didn't expect a great character plot, but this one was ridiculous.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Sprecht0613 Dwayne was perfect for a disaster movie superhero, but character plot &amp; ignorance of so much death was more than unrealistic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NastyyyNas LOL!  So THAT is why it was only available in 3D or Imax ....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sprecht0613 It could have been SO good!  Ended up being SO VERY weak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CubLovesCher I giggled at some points and that isn't usually a good sign for a disaster movie....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@filmteach I couldn't have described it better myself. I LOVE disaster movies and am so disappointed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Misty_Myrick @JamesGo84135761 @Queerty Thats silly. There would be no more then what they would normally get from mean people. You can't...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Misty_Myrick @JamesGo84135761 @Queerty One must use them to change, so why not cater to everyone without stepping on anyone's rights.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Misty_Myrick @JamesGo84135761 @Queerty A third changeroom/washroom wouldn't be ignoring theirs. It would grant privacy to everyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Misty_Myrick @JamesGo84135761 @Queerty I never suggested anyone was parading around. The issue is just about personal privacy, &amp; anatomy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TessenSentoki @JamesGo84135761 @Queerty Hypothetical. Kids could have been in there w/their mother. Personal space &amp; privacy is the issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Misty_Myrick @DaveAvenger @JamesGo84135761 @Queerty It's not fair to force it on moms/woman who don't want their kids around naked men.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JamesGo84135761 @Queerty @MikeOkuda A third changeroom so the comfort, feelings and rights of all individuals are respected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PlanetFitness So sad to see that only the feelings &amp; rights of the LGBT community are respected, rather than adding a third changeroom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry, but if a man walks into a washroom/change room while me or my daughter is there, wearing a dress&amp;makeup or not he's getting a smack!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RobertPicardo She obviously left a delicious mark on the world! I see two pieces....care to share?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So cool seeing a #Smallville episode with @John_Schneider &amp; @wopatofficial . Brings back memories! Did I just give my age? #DukesofHazzard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My heart jumped when @carrieffisher favorited my tweet. Few celebs would make me cry, but tears would come if I met her. #MyChildhoodHero<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidduchovny @FrankSpotnitz Did you autograph it for him? Or did he prefer the chest?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@carrieffisher @WilliamShatner Is it true the two of you are going to be cast as lovers in the sequel to Sleeping With The Enemy? ;)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheJimMichaels Just finished watching the epi &amp; its the first time this season that I feel like the show is back on it's original course :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JJ_Sherwood They really need to go back to some earlier unfinished storylines, Michael &amp; Lucifer in the pit, the antichrist kid, etc.. #spn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JensenAckles Have been watching #smallville. You were pretty incredible in it. The chemistry with @MsKristinKreuk was fantastic :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JJ_Sherwood Too hard of a question! But I do think the series was at it's best from seasons 1-5. 6-8 were good but 9 &amp; 10 not so much. #spn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CraveTVCanada Will the increasing buffering pauses people have been talking about be clearing up soon? I've noticed an increase as well.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CraveTVCanada is quickly becoming the hub for many of my scifi/fantasy needs. Keep it coming guys!  #CantWaitForChromecast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it strange to admit the more I watch #Smallville, the more I fall in love with Lex Luthor? O.o lol @mrosenbaum711 you are the best! ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Community: How Well Do You Know Middle-Earth Mythology?  http://t.co/teZdoYws1J via @buzzfeeders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet again a major awards show snubs anything scifi/fantasy. Horrible for the cast&amp;crews who work so hard to tell a real story. @goldenglobes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally saw the final #Hobbit movie last night &amp; of course cried. No doubt #PeterJackson made the 6 best films in movie history. ThankYouPJ!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gameofthrones Come to Ontario, Canada please! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love watching the @RealDeanCain as Superman again in Lois and Clark. Crushing ;) Didn't get to see all of it before. #ThankYouCraveTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching @jumblejim Beaver as an invisible man in an old Lois and Clark episode. Priceless!!! lol #BobbyMeetsSuperman<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My dog Maggie always lets the biggest most resounding unlady-like burp after eating her dinner. Compliment to the chef maybe? #doggymanners<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xf_trustno1_xf @xfilesnews Awesome topic! Hope you post it online when you are finished! I'm sure many would love to read it! Good luck :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rewatched Superman Returns (again). Still sad that @BrandonJRouth is not playing Superman today. He was born for the role! #AlwaysMySuperman<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donniewahlberg @jennymccarthy I'm so happy for you that she makes you so happy Donnie! Much love and kisses to you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#KaleyCuoco , there was nothing wrong with what you said and no reason to apologize. Stay true to what your heart tells you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watched #TheMazeRunner. Was blown away by it's amazing content &amp; cast! A must-see movie! Can't wait for the next one! @mazerunnermovie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WilliamShatner Happy New Year &amp; all the best to my forever Captain and fellow canuck! Much love to you, from SciFiFantasyGirl *hugs*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarrettRWang Happy New Year Garrett, with much love from, SciFiFantasyGirl :)  *big hugs*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wishing everyone, especially fans of scifi/fantasy, a safe, healthy &amp; #HappyNewYear!  May 2015 be a great year for scifi/fantasy films &amp; tv!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jensenackles One of those "you know you're in Canada when..." moments. Gotta love my country! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you feel really cold, hot chocolate with a hefty dose of #PanamaJack will seriously warm you up.  #FeelingTipsyInWinter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joeymcintyre As someone who lost her mother 9 years ago I'm very sorry for your loss. My mom died from lung cancer at age 51. #MissingHer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got some #ChristmasShopping done today. Now waiting to watch a #SantaClausParade . :)  Remember, #JesusIsTheReasonForTheSeason<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Living under His love and grace. #JesusSaves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Arnon? @Mark_Sheppard I didn't know you were in #Charmed! And loved you in #XFiles . Is there anything you can't do? #SPN #JackOfAllTrades<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ian_eastwood Look up Rodney King riots in L.A. Those were crazy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>12 buildings burned, many cars trashed &amp; burned, 21+ businesses' windows smashed, arrests for firearms,violence,looting,vandalism. #Ferguson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN can you show other protests and marches happening in NY, L.A and Washington right now? Lots of tweets about those areas.  #Ferguson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Protests happening in St. Louis, New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, San Franscisco...perhaps more.  #Ferguson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fires so far - storage units,meat market,beauty store,Little Caesars, Walgreens,auto parts store.Too dangerous for fire trucks. #Ferguson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blogsofwar Not to mention the threatening Walgreens, storage units and auto parts store....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching businesses destroyed and on fire thinking of the now jobless owners and employees so close to Christmas. #Ferguson - this is wrong!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3 buildings on fire, at least 2 police cars on fire, tons of businesses broken &amp; looted. I feel so bad for the peaceful people in #Ferguson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing says fighting for justice like smashing &amp; looting the #Ferguson Market &amp; Liquor Store. I'm sure that will get your point across.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Police need to be trained to shoot to incapacitate first &amp; shoot to kill last. Use tasers, shoot non-lethal areas of the body. #Ferguson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am entirely against police brutality but I am also against youth of any race breaking the law. Two wrongs equaled tragedy in #Ferguson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Forget terrorism. America is it's own worst enemy. I've never seen a country filled with so much hatred among it's own people. #Ferguson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't believe how much @CNN is salivating over the possibility of violence and riots in #Ferguson tonight. You make me sick!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarrettRWang Hi Garrett. Glad you are having fun in Alberta. *big hugs* Stay warm!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danneelharris  JJ Ackles, tellin' it like it is! Wise words!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My heart will break if the allegations against Bill Cosby are true. I've always loved him. I wish he'd speak out..say something to his fans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SO glad #Supernatural is back to normal, as are my guys! :) #SavingPeopleHuntingThings #TakingCases #SPN201 @TheJimMichaels<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#WalkingDead was good this time. Oh wait, Walking Dead is good every time!  #LoveThisShow !!! #SaveBeth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the fact that we've been able to land a robot on a comet doesn't impress you more than Kim K's oily air-brushed ass, you are beyond help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnnycortese @jarpad @mattgregory2  Groan.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therock I've got three kids and a husband. I'm always slapping the sh*t out of somebody! ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ajayfry Gotta love your job eh? :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People are strange.... O.o  *goes back into solitary hibernation*<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@osricchau @jensenackles @rthompson1138 I still have it paused on that shot ;) lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My husband has fallen asleep during the #Supernatural200thEpisode and is snoring beside me . The divorce papers will be drawn up tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rthompson1138 Be honest...this is one of the episodes that had the most outtakes during filming?! ;) Lots of laughs I bet! #Supernatural200<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jarpad @JensenAckles Thank U for your love &amp; dedication. You boys are a class act; one that will be a hard one to follow! Carry on! #SPN200<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheJimMichaels :') What I see in this show is an extremely bonded cast &amp; crew who are devoted to their fanbase. Nothing compares! #SPN200<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thejimmichaels #Supernatural and #XFiles . The man was a genius! #KimManners<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@se4realhinton @mishacollins You all should be proud of what you have accomplished :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarryOn_SPN #1of200 Can't pick! But I can say it feels like more than just a show; like the fans R part of something bigger. #Supernatural<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@garrettrwang Thanks for answering Garrett. You are seriously the sweetest! *sends Canadian twitter hugs*<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I want to escape into a world all my own.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TSN_Sports Please hire Ron MacLean &amp; Don Cherry &amp; give them a full intermission to talk about whatever they want. Save them! #CBCRogersRots<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy Birthday to my #StarTrekVoyager crush @RobertDMcNeill . I hope you are having an amazing day :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reneauberjonois Classic! My teen son and I watched the original one and it was great! Better than the reboot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The newest trailer! Goosebumps &amp; tears!  Cinema doesn't get better than what Peter Jackson has done with these trilogies&lt;3  @TheHobbitMovie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertDMcNeill @GarrettRWang Does Tim Russ not have a twitter? Always amazed at his vulcan portrayal, which makes outtakes even funnier :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reneauberjonois And now I will be looking up Captain Video! Have been watching a lot of old scifi lately in appreciation of the evolution.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reneauberjonois Nice :)  Alright...favorite ST movie? If you can choose. It's hard for me...lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarrettRWang @reneauberjonois I've wondered if many of the Star Trek celebs are, were already, or had become fans through their work on ST?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#WalkingDead tomorrow night! Is this the highlight of all my weekends now? Why yes it is!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@garysinise I wish I could see your band. Sadly though I'm in Canada. I'm sure the troops will appreciate your tribute :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@williamshatner Darn! I thought you said Scrabble and I was all ready to get my board out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TahmohPenikett How was the #SPN200 party for you? I really wish you could have had a longer run on the show. You were a great addition! &lt;3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just noticed #netflix added season 10 of #GreysAnatomy !  #MarathonTime ! Yes, I know its not SciFi/Fantasy ... #SueMe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you marathon watch #CSI Vegas and you want to be married to Nick and yet have Grissom as a father. #AmIWeird<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mishacollins The fabric of our life...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillCosby @iClANO Always wanted Bill to be my dad. Not sure how he'd explain the racial difference though. lol  &lt;3 u Mr. Cosby! *big hugs*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OsricChau I didn't realize you were hatched!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertDMcNeill I used to have a crush on Tom Paris...lol  Anyways, was wondering if you will be directing any SPN episodes this season? :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reneauberjonois Sweet dreams Rene!  Sleep well!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reneauberjonois @Wianette_Raven @GarrettRWang @RobertDMcNeill @RobertPicardo Yep! Trek for me is like a warm familiar blanket to curl up in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reneauberjonois @GarrettRWang @RobertDMcNeill @RobertPicardo True. I never really compare. Each series is every bit important to Trek :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarrettRWang Found this and although you've probably seen it already, I had to post because it's such a treat! lol  http://t.co/ResKdgeQzp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robertpatrickT2 Happy Birthday Mr. Patrick!  God bless you this year and all the rest to come. You are an amazing man!  *big Canadian hugs*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As if head pain isn't enough, the visual disturbances, pain &amp; other sensations in other parts of the body amplifies the attack. #migraines<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@osricchau Try going shopping for another dress and see if that helps ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@se4realhinton *reaches for a bottle of Panama Jack*  Alrighty then...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dicksp8jr @jarpad @jensenackles @mishacollins And subsequently who uses the most hair care products?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@se4realhinton True...I always wonder how professional writers deal with the stress of a deadline when dealing with any of those aspects.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nanavisitor Very sad &amp; I can't believe there isn't more being done for the veterans down there after their sacrifice! (I'm Canadian)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@se4realhinton Professional question from one little aspiring writer to a well established one :) How do you deal with writer's block?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarrettRWang Is it true about you and the Delaney sisters?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*high fives @nathankress * Chocolate and peanut butter all the way!!! #HeavenlyMixture<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reneauberjonois Just pretty good? In comparison to what? ;)  @garrettrwang @robertdmcneill @robertpicardo @wianette_raven #TrekWar<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@reneauberjonois @abhi_onemanband @williamshatner On absolutely everything! ;) #SuckingUp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't agree with Britany Maynard's suicide as being brave. Bravery is fighting your cancer with strength &amp; hope till the end. #MyMom &lt;3<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#WalkingDead episode was great as usual! Not even gonna feel bad when Carol saves Beth &amp; blows up that hospital, walking away like Rambo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emmykinney Emily your episode was so good! Loved seeing your character more in depth. Great acting :) #WalkingDead #Bethisode #SoManySlaps<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Seeing Dick Roman as a sleezy lawyer in a past #CSI Vegas episode. Yep, seems about right...lol #Supernatural<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely adorable! :) *listens as the fandom goes wild* lol  Thanks for sharing this moment! @danneelharris @realgpad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just got caught up with the two beginning season 2 episodes of @cwthe100 . Fantastic &amp; so well done! Can't wait for more! #WatchThisShow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@garrettrwang Can't see it happening which makes me really sad. But a girl can always dream. I'd love to be around other scifi lovers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarrettRWang How are you feeling? Have you recouperated? Heading to any Cons over the next little while? I still have yet to go to one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you have migraine pain 2-5 days every week and no medicines, doctors or neurologists have been able to help. #HurtingSoBad :'(<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@williamshatner Now THAT is a day to celebrate! Swiss or Belgium?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think out of all the #StarTrek ships to live and serve on, I'd have to pick Voyager...as their needed counselor :) @GarrettRWang<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you #HouseHuntersInternational for allowing me the priviledge of both traveling and spying on people all from the comfort of my couch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@conservativegi3 Ugh, I hurt just reading this ;) lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't wrap my head around how a person could walk up to another &amp; shoot them, let alone a student doing it. Why does this happen in America?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, so - Yes! Michonne has her sword! - Man, is Rick ever losing it! - What about Carol?? - Last, I'm dying to know about Beth! #WalkingDead<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@reneauberjonois You know, out of all the #StarTreks I've always thought DS9 had the best and most beautiful finale :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NanaVisitor Yay! Another great ST alumni! Btw my cousin named her daughter after your character at the insistence of her trekkie husband :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarrettRWang when you're feeling up to it don't forget you need to run that transtator diagnostic... Umm what is a transtator anyway?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@williamshatner Did you catch #Arrow and/or the premiere of the second season of #The100 tonight?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you want an idea on how peaceful and safe #Ottawa , the capital city of #Canada usually is, it has only had 4 killings all year.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@garrettrwang That's great to hear! Just remember, don't push yourself even if your feeling better. Pneumonia takes a lot out of the body :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I think the theme music for each of the #StarTrek shows are the most beautiful ever composed. #JerryGoldsmith<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm still not impressed Ben Affleck is the new Batman, and now they may make Robin a woman! I may skip the #BatmanSuperman movie altogether!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't get last night's #TheWalkingDead out of my mind! So many questions! And was Bob infected when he was bbq'd? Man that grossed me out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TheWalkingDead is on tonight! *grabs gun and sits between the tv and the door* I'm ready!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@garrettrwang Are you feeling any better at all? *hugs*<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Any plans to direct another #Supernatural episode? @RobertDMcNeill<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robertdmcneill @garrettrwang One of my most favorite dynamic duos! I'd have each of you, one on each arm if I could guys! ;) #VoyagerLives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watched the big Lizzie episode in #TheWalkingDead. More than a little disturbing! Give that girl her own horror movie! #LookAtTheFlowers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gilmckinney Oh no! What are you going to do now? ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I seriously need Doctor McCoy to give me something for this migraine. #StarTrek #FuturisticWishes<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Enjoyed seeing @Wm_Sadler in #TheFlash . Absolutely loved him in #Roswell .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Demon Dean makes me grieve for non-demon Dean. It was the same when Sam was souless. It hurts my heart! #Supernatural @JensenAckles @jarpad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@winchesterwoman Exactly! I have so many questions about that! Nothing about it makes sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@proudspner @awright72878 We need that on a t-shirt! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheJimMichaels I don't understand how Dean killed Cole's father when Cole was 13. Isn't there an age discreptancy? #Supernatural<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Late start for #Supernatural tonight. Hannah is so green! Just like Cas used to be. It's cute :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everytime I see @donallogue on #Gotham I want him to say "Ragnar Lothbrooke"... He was SO good in #Vikings !<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The fact that I love #TheWalkingDead terrifies me more than the damn show does! #IsThereSomethingWrongWithMe<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WilliamShatner  Happy Thanksgiving weekend Mr. Shatner! &lt;3 xoxo #MyCaptainAlways #StarTrekLivesOn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And Thanksgiving weekend baking has begun! Pumpkin and cherry pies, chocolate cupcakes, and apple crisp! #HappyThanksgivingWeekendCanada<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To be watching @Mark_Sheppard my #SPN (&amp; #XFiles alumni) fave &amp; #BSG 's #TriciaHelfer in an old #CSI episode... Very cool! #SciFiNerdgasm<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Shows I'm glad are beginning again - #SPN #Arrow #TWD #The100, &amp; the premiere of #TheFlash. Enjoying #Gotham. Need to catch up on #BATB !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jerilryan @robertpicardo You didn't happen to sing a duet of 'You Are My Sunshine' together did you? ;) Love you both! *hugs*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And when you are watching another old episode of #CSI and recognize Sam as Hershel from #TheWalkingDead!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you are watching old #CSI episodes and the serial killer was the 'Observer' from #Fringe!  O.o<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RE: Interview w/ @netanyahu by CNN's Zakaria. Why does the U.S. who doesn't negotiate with terrorists expect Israel to negotiate with Hamas?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_mckenzie makes me want to be Barbara. Seriously Mr. Gordon, you can arrest me anytime! ;)  #BadClicheButSoTrue #HolyGothamBatman<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gotham should have Rachel Dawes. Seriously. Her and Bruce as children would be great! #PleaseAddHerToTheCast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mishacollins Don't follow me Misha. #ReversePsychology  Did that work? Is he following me now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching Jim Gordon on #Gotham makes me wish I was Barbara Gordon. He is just yummy! #ArrestMeAnytime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has there ever been peace in the #MiddleEast? It just seems like its one barbaric fight after another. It's neverending! #ISIS #Terrorists<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With growing outbreaks (#ebola etc) I'm once again glad I'm Canadian and soon it will be too damn cold here for such diseases. #LetItSnow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The people of #HongKong are the most peaceful and patient mass demonstrators I have ever seen! #GoodPeople #WishingThemTheBest<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mishacollins As a Canadian I'll bring the backbacon and maple syrup. #WhatDidYouExpect ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@williamshatner I think that you should provide us with a Stardate tweet each day...maybe with an opening log entry? #CaptainsLog<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watched @rachel_luttrell in #Charmed ! Was fun seeing her back in the day so to speak. I wonder if she got to keep the amulet... ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not even American &amp; think Obama's #coffeecupsalute was lazy &amp; disrespectful, not just to the 2 marines, but all U.S military that serve.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2010 definitely doesn't hold a candle to the beauty of 2001. But it's alright, and 2061 should really be made. #TheSciFiMustGoOn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I believe in being more conservative with our natural resources, but I also believe #climatechange is a natural occurance. #floodwallstreet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #Charmed and who do I see, it's @mishacollins on the screen in front if me! #BadRhymeButWhoCares<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NathanFillion @WilliamShatner That's some punny stuff!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheJimMichaels have you thought about doing an #SPN spin off with Crowley &amp; the demons?  @Mark_Sheppard is already loved. Just an idea :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really miss the #JerryLewis and the #LaborDayMuscularDystrophyTelethon . Anyone else miss it too? #FunForAGoodCause<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robertpatrickT2 Watched T1 last night for the first time. My son loved it! Now we're watching T2 &amp; I'm telling him how awesome you are :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the best ways I've seen it put -   "Part of my childhood died today."  #RIPRobinWilliams<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WilliamShatner  No truer words have been spoken!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amazing words from one of my favorite movies with #RobinWilliams .  #JackMovie  https://t.co/jbEAGHU46u<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it strange to want to cry for someone you have never met? My heart breaks for him and his family :'( #RestInPeaceRobinWilliams<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In shock. #RobinWilliams gone? Just like that? It just isn't sinking in. He was one of my absolute favorite stars :'( #CantBelieveIt #RIP<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AshliSlytherin I'm starting to think they let the ninth episodes of each season be the big ones :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshliSlytherin No I haven't.  I didn't mean the content of what was in the season finale.  Just that it wasn't as 'big' as I expected. (c)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@plantinstructie @GarrettRWang Indeed!  I've said some pretty bizarre things to people because of it.   O.o<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it just me or was the season finale of @GameOfThrones less than what so many had hoped for? It was good, but not as a season finale. #Meh<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GarrettRWang Yes, go eat.  And share.   What are we having?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TeddyWilson @RockysSportsBar "What's that?" "This my friend...is a pint." "It comes in pints? I'm getting one!" Sorry. I had to LOTR this;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GilMcKinney Is basketball your favorite sport to watch?  As a Canadian girl, I'm all hockey and figure skating...lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've had a #migraine every day since I got my #wisdomteeth out on Friday.  Two kinds of pain, all day long &amp; nothing touches it! #ThisSucks<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@se4realhinton Ugh!  Nope, I got dissolvable stitches that feel like fishing line. Spit a piece out yesterday that had come free. Fun stuff!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@se4realhinton I find the worst pain is coming from where he cut and stitched.  My God it's bad!  I think I'd rather give birth again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did this weeks episode of #GameOfThrones remind any #LOTR fans of the battle of Helm's Deep? #MashingMyTwoFavesTogether<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mittensisevil Wasn't as bad as the #RedWedding. The only thing they could do bloodier than that is throwing a bucket of blood at the camera<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexnord11 Stick with it through to the second season because I found that's when things really get going :)  Just my opinion though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ch1naBBY Omigosh!  That is SO true! Great...I'll never look at a tomato the same now! lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it just me, or does the dirtier #JonSnow gets in #GameOfThrones, the sexier he is?  #AManShouldntBeThatGoodLooking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ch1naBBY Not nearly as bad as what happened to Oberyn's eyes last week though...lol<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@se4realhinton How did you survive?  Seriously!  I feel like I'm dying a slow painful death!  And I'm starving!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarrettRWang See?  Now that made me smile :)  Thank you and I'll take your word for it :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@se4realhinton Had 3 wisdom teeth out yesterday. Stitches in one of the gums. There are no words for this kind of pain. Ever had yours out?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need an emergency tweet fro @GarrettRWang .  Had 3 wisdom teeth out yesterday &amp; I feel like I'm dying a slow painful death! #NeedTheDoctor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hurting, bleeding, swelling, repeat.  #WisdomTeethSurgeryProblems<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was showing my daughter Sister Act &amp; all of a sudden I yell 'Bobby Singer' which hurt because I just got my wisdom teeth out. #Ow @jumblejim<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarrettRWang  http://t.co/p5O0GvIMBn<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Thinking of 8yr old Martin, who died in the #BostonMarathonAttack, &amp; his 6yr old sister, a dancer, who lost one leg &amp; part of the other :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@varia2u True, &amp; lies have spread for RTs &amp; FFs, which is sickening. I just focus on new information &amp; the stories of the victims &amp; heroes!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>When you can't swallow properly and coffee comes out your nose....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@teamjaredjensen Been doing that for the past week :) Lovin it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hot cup of coffee with french vanilla coffeemate and some #PropertyVirgins on #HGTV Anything to keep me from thinking of my painful throat!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dean: "Dad." John: "Hey boys." The reunion :') All the tears with the three of them.  I love my Winchester family! #SPNSeasonOneShadow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aaaaw....Dean saying he wants to be a family again, just like he was a kid. #SPNSeasonOneShadow #SPNfeels So glad I'm rewatching everything!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blond Meg...she was so smooth &amp; cunning.  And Sam being caught outside her apartment &amp; the lady calling him a pervert.  :) #SPNSeason1Shadow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One more for the night. #SPNSeasonOne Shadow  Sam and Dean in Security Alarm uniforms :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dean: I'll say it again, Demons I get...people are crazy!" #SPNSeasonOneBenders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Supernatural and #CriminalMinds both had hillbillies who hunted humans for sport. Who did it first? @guynormanbee #SPNSeasonOneBenders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dean on being found out he was being a big black cop. "I've lost some weight....and I've got that Michael Jacksin skin thing..." #SPNBenders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dean as Greg: "Yeah, Dean... he was kind of the black sheep of the family. Handsome though!" #SPNSeasonOneBenders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now watching #SPNSeasonOne Benders. Original Godzilla vs Mothma...Dean's fav :) Sam getting pulled from under the car, not so cool. "Sammy!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember when Dean was secretly freakedout about Sam's abilities the more they grew, but still said he'd take care of him #Season1Nightmare<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think this might had been the first time I had seen one of #SabrinaTheTeenageWitch's Aunts in another role. #SPNSeasonOneNightmare<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Poor Sam and his painful dreams and visions back in those days. He seemed so young! #SPNSeasonOneNightmare<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dean and Sam as priests in the Nightmare :) My SPNSeasonOne re-watch. Dean: "We are all God's children." Sam asking him to tone it down. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, know what? If I knew that Dean Winchester had feelings for me, I wouldn't be sayin it wasn't going to work! I'd go with him everywhere!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sam: "So burning the body had no effect in the thing?" Dean: "Sure it did, it pissed it off even more!" #SPNSeasonOneRoute666<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sam really does act like the annoying little brother in this episode! So rare he gets to do that for fun, &amp; so adorable! #Route666<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sam getting Dean to admit he'd been inlove with Cassie. Love Sam in this episode! Love how Dean leans against doorposts even more! #Route666<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It felt like they were trying to do something early on with Dean that just didn't fit or work for him. #SPNSeasonOneRoute666Cassie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #SupernaturalSeason1 Route666. Never was sold on the past girlfriend thing. Maybe if they had brought her in more episodes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do dogs like to lay on freshly cleaned and folded laundry? #LittleMaggieOwnsTheHouse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When your tv suddenly seems like its HD after you clean it. Wow, I had no idea it was that bad! Yikes! #JustLikeNew #GuessIShouldDustMore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #FourWeddingsCanada and wishing yet again I could be a wedding planner... *sigh*<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I need this to go away.....now! #PleaseDontLetMeHaveStrepAgain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dean to Layla:"Well, I'm not much of the prayin type...but I'm gonna pray for you!" Love this! #SPNSeasonOneFaith And with that, goodnight:)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It really is one ugly reaper! And yet Tess is so pretty when she reaps! lol #SPNSeasonOneFaith<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dean: You aren't going to let me die in peace are you?" Sam: "I'm not going to let you die period!" Love @JulieBenz as Layla! #SPNSeasonOne<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Sam meeting Meg for the first time. Dean's famous "Dude you fugly!" Seriously...that Scarecrow always creeps me out! #SaveMeDean #SPNSeason1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deampala2005 Awww, big hugs recieved! I miss John!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #SupernaturalSeasonOne Scarecrow. Sam talking to daddy Winchester... #SPNfeels<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertDMcNeill I'm fangirling right now! Had a crush on Tom in STV! A tweet from you would mean SO much :D &lt;3<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bodyguard4jandj Nothing! I'd much rather live in your world Clif! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now watching #SupernaturalSeasonOne Asylum Where do they find these creepy abandoned buildings &amp; why would people want to spend the night!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When phone calls interrupt your #Supernatural viewing enjoyment, causing you to have to pause often. #LetMeCarryOnWithMyBoys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When the boys see Mary for the first time &amp; then "You, get out of my house. And let go of my son!" #SPNSeasonOneHome #Feels<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Missouri, after smacking Dean's head: "Forgive this boy! He means well, he's just not the sharpest tool in the shed! #SPNSeasonOneHome :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When the spirit shuts the fridge with the little boy inside and locks it...*shiver* #SPNSeasonOneHome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Enter Missouri! She's adorable! #SPNSeasonOneHome "Oh you boys grew up handsome!" Looks at Dean. "And you were one goofy lookin' kid too!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate it when people's hands get stuck and mauled in the garbage compactor. *shudder* #SPNSeasonOneHome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dean making a tearful phonecall to dad.... #SPNSeasonOneHome #TearyDeanFeelings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Poor Dean doesn't want to go back home... #SPNSeasonOneHome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #SupernaturalSeasonOne 'Home'. I'd say its a good episode, but every episode is a good episode ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samjacklover In honor of Dean ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sans_heart Guess I need to do more convention creeping on youtube... :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guynormanbee @robertpatrickt2 His work is amazing. And love how gracious and humble he is! Of course you aren't so bad yourself! ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rainbowfrancks My husband was a Grandmaster Flash fan when he was young. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guynormanbee Thats too bad! It probably would've been pretty cool directing the great Robert Patrick! Of course Gillian too! And Annabeth:)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guynormanbee I'm a huge X-Files fan. Had you ever had the chance, would you have liked to direct episodes? Any you like best? :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>No one in the entire world could play Dean better than Jensen :) &lt;3 #SPNfamily #AcklesWinchester<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Larry: "We accept homeowners of any race, religion, colour or sexual orientation." Dean: "We're brothers!" #SPNSeasonOneBugs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Re-watching #SupernaturalSeasonOne 'Bugs'. Dean: "Wasn't that on Oprah?" Sam: "You watch Oprah?"<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Sam and Lori actually look really sweet together!  :)  #SPNSeasonOne #Hookman<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love how there was a vicious murder at their sorority house, person wasn't caught, and they still hold a party!  O.o  #SPNSeasonOne #Hookman<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PaulyMcGillion Ty for faving sir :) I want to say, though I'm sure you've heard it before, but I cried when Beckett died. So shocking&amp;sad!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulyMcGillion @rainbowfrancks Atlantis commentary: Rachel - Rainbow is smokin'! Paul - "He certainly is..." HA! Sorry, that made me lol!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rainbowfrancks Ok, weird question; when you eat food on set, is it cold, stale ect from takes? Again weird I know, but I've wondered. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rainbowfrancks Their biggest mistake imho! I could only dream of being involved in a project like that, being the sci-fi girl I am :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RainbowFrancks Listening to commentary for the first episodes of Atlantis. Was it as much making the series as it seemed? :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robertpatrickT2 Watching commentary of the first Atlantis episode. Enjoying hearing how much Joe liked working with U &amp; how good U are! :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ledabunnie I stopped watching I was so mad. And not even nominated in catagories like cinematography!? Please! They were majorly snubbed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Oscars Why've you snubbed #TheHobbit 4 so many catagories &amp; nods???!!! Because its not American perhaps? #politics #pissedoff #PeterJackson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnnycortese I thought it would be between Pi &amp; Hobbit, but then I also thought the Hobbit should've ben nommed for cinimatography. &gt;.&lt;<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@se4realhinton You aren't missing much. It's pretty blah in every way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@domswildthings Better be some Hobbit wins! Should have been up for best picture &amp; such. Peter &amp; gang are amazing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realdonaldtrump Meh. I think its too hard to follow previous greats like Martin, Crystal and Goldberg.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WilliamShatner Finally! Some ST at the #Oscars...in some capacity!  Captain Kirk, you made my Oscar night! ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Helen Hunt... Always understated and under-rated. Elequent beauty! #OscarsRedCarpet<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@middleearthnews Just wish they had been nominated for best picture too. They deserved it! #politics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still mad that #TheHobbit isn't at least nominated for best picture at #TheOscars tonight. Its just wrong! :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanneelHarris U are amazing! Despite the hate you've been getting, U still open up to fans of U &amp; J. TY for being U, &amp; all the best! &lt;3 xo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpaceChannel Sick of #Oscars always shunning SciFi/FantasyMovies for the non-tech awards! Many good stories &amp; actors ignored! #UnderRated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...against the SciFi/Fantasy genre! They are more than special effects They are creative dramatic stories with fantastic actors. #UnderRated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact that #TheHobbit isn't even nominated for best picture at the #Oscars solidifies my opinion that its prejudiced &amp; discriminatory....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>By the looks of it I'm guessing Danneel is due in May.  Any thoughts #SPNFamily? #AcklesBabyDueDate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SewGeekAustin @SupportSPN I would TOTALLY go for that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PCA2013Updates You know it!  After all....it's the family business! ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cadlymack Couldn't you see him carved onto Mount Rushmore? ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPN_Hunter_67 @AustinBasis  I tried watching it...couldn't get into it at all.  Wish Arrow or Revolution won....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@winchesterwoman Bahahahahahaaaa! *hugs*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanneelHarris   :D Still my biggest highlight of the night -  #BabyAcklesBellyRub  You both look so happy and truly blessed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sereinaSPN Ooooohhh.....those eyes!  *melts*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdorkableKati @SPN_Hunter_67 Was JUST saying that to my hubby!  LOL!!!  I'd better make a spot on the mantle ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jarpad Love you guys!  XXOO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanneelHarris MUAH!!! xoxoxo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok...heads been aching all day &amp; very medicated but I made it through 2 the end!  Nite SPNFAMILY! If U could share me out I'd appreciate it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@se4realhinton Congrats to you! :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Always loved her!  What a humble person and eloquent speaker :) #Sandra Bullock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@winchesterwoman There was nothing wring with what you said! :)  I just don't trust the Hollywood elitists when it comes to Sci-fi/Fantasy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PCAs There is no way your results are accurate.  And furthermore....what a very boring night!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"MostPopularHollywoodCelebrityAwards", its not about the fans voting, despite what the system says. Sci-fi/Fantasy is rarely taken seriously<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When our J's were presenting, was it just me or did it look like there was some tension between them? #SPNFamily  It was weird....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There have been a few of suspicious results tonight. Swear it's rigged!  But who cares, we know how much our boys deserve any kind of award!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PCAs All we want is the stuff about Supernatural. Why don't you just dedicate the show to that. They win every category;) DONE!  #SPNFAMILY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Off to watch!  Will tweet during commercials!  Go #SPNFAMILY GO!!!  Feel free to follow me fellow fans!!! &lt;3<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ronraines Its great some castmates still see each other :) Wish there was a Soap Channel that could replay Guiding Light &amp; the many others!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spn_hunter_67 That's horrible! Wish there was a cure so I could live a normal life but there are people worse off than me. Praying for all!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realgpad @danneelharris Best Wishes to Jensen &amp; @jarpad for wins at the #PeoplesChoiceAwards tonight! No actors/show is more deserving! xo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@spn_hunter_67 I'm on disability; get debilitating migraines up to 3 times a week. We r a family of 5. There is no way I'll ever get to one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPN_Hunter_67 You guys make me cry...I've always wanted to go to a con, but we just don't have that kind of money :'(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thinking about a #JensenAckles and #JoeFlanigan sandwich...them as the bread, &amp; me as the meat... ;) #FineLookingMen #Supernatural #Stargate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spn_sherry I made my hubby a fan, and hope to make more if our netflix canada ever gets its butt in gear and finally brings supernatural!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tessa811222 I also love how protective this fandom is of our actors their families &amp; crew, &amp; each other. I've never seen anything like it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@winchesterwoman @spn_hunter_67 ...who love to be taken away from our daily lives. We also appreciate everything that goes into the shows!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@winchesterwoman @spn_hunter_67 ...mainstream hollywood &amp; award shows. We're close knit, fiercly loyal, &amp; often dreamers, appreciating...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@winchesterwoman @spn_hunter_67 I think sci-fi/fantasy fandoms are unique in the sense that they are not typically accepted by most...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spn__quotes Brilliant! ;)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@unique_jenique She is clearly sick&amp;twisted to think like that! I hate the fact it makes us as fans look bad. She claims to be a Dean fan!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@assbutt_  Yes! Its sad that there are "fans" who don't think that hurting their wives really hurts them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@unique_jenique Lara Martinez I think, who said she'd like a miscarraige 2 happen; she wants 2 do voodoo &amp; have the baby come out in pieces.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TanyaDawnVisser A fellow Ontario SPN fan! Whoot! :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Deampala2005 Wow....a fellow SPN fan who is also a fellow Blockhead! Very cool....lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@winchesterwoman Good to know :) TY for your honest opinion hun.Think I'll give them a try, although my list of books to read keeps growing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@winchesterdaily Otherwise known as an extra moment of #Winchester eye-candytime ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guynormanbee I find episodes of different shows U direct all have a high level of energy, anticipation &amp; excitement.Can tell U &lt;3 your job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guynormanbee Wow, TY for the reply! Bare with me. I had pvr'd 3 of them. I think it was the one that had the bombing attempt at the mall...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@winchesterwoman They are enough to give you a fix between seasons? lol :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donniewahlberg I love you Donnie! Have a great day and try to stay warm :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeLoveSPN  #SPNFans Any thoughts on the Supernatural books I've been seeing in Chapters and thought about getting into?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guynormanbee Watched a Criminal Minds episode today that you had directed. #GreatDirectorsOfGreatTVShows<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@winchesterwoman Sonya...have you ever read any of the Supernatural books? Have seen them in Chapters and been wondering how they are...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@j2_fans *sigh* Be still my heart....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jarpad @realgpad Twitter for dummies? lol Just kidding! Love you guys!  #BestCoupleOnTwitterNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jumblejim @madbeaver10 My kids...not so excited. Me on the otherhand...YAYYA! Maybe thats why I can't sleep either...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realGpad Gen! You tweet now! I know I sound desperate, but have 2 say this is 1 of the best belated Christmas gifts an SPN fan could have!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ainoutao @welovespn Dean's everything is so perfect ;) Whoot!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@david_boreanaz No no...don't do that to your child! Go Leafs Go! ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@domswildthings When do the oscar announcements come out? Maybe a nomination for DiCaprio?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bookerworm77 @welovespn Sam's pain was tangible, &amp; Dean's hurting for him made me cry for both. The gunshot was like a dam breaking for me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I understand something #WalterBishop says on #Fringe, does it automatically mean I'm crazy too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thinking about starting a petition to get #Supernatural &amp; more brought to #NetflixCanada.Then I won't have to get up &amp; load my dvd player :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Netflix_CA Dear Netflix, ty for #Fringe &amp; always keep XFiles and STNG. But please add more #StarTreks, #StargateAtlantis and #Supernatural!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@welovespn Remember the episode where Sam has to kill the werewolf girl he fell in love with? Was a TOTAL MESS at its ending! Heartbreaking!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@welovespn I've cried a few times! Mostly when Dean cries. Jensen is so good at tugging not only at my heartstrings, but also my tearducts!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BradDouriff how is it that you can be so awesomely freaky &amp; creepy? And I think you've been on all my fav. shows. Same with #MarkSheppard !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#MentionAGoodCouple Mulder &amp; Scully, Peanut butter &amp; Jam, me and Dean Winchester...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeLoveSPN It's one of those series' you wish would last forever. Scary to think that they're in season 8. Keep being afraid they'll end it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In love with Mulder and Scully. Thank you to netflix for keeping #x-files so I can just keep watching the series over again! ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@winchesterwoman Thanks for the follow! Good to meet someone who has so much in common with me &amp; has ackleseptionally good taste! ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@winchesterwoman I think Jensen Ackles is on the earth specifically to make women smile ;) He is my 'Happy Place' lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@winchesterwoman Thanks....she was beautiful...was only 51yrs old.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@winchesterwoman That's terrible. Mine had lung cancer that spread to the brain by the time it was found. Then it spread to bones &amp; liver.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@winchesterwoman Not sure my mom was. The whole thing was such a shock, went fast &amp; was very painful. Thanks &amp; so sorry about yours! *hugs*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@winchesterwoman I know...its so hard to watch. I looked after my mom for most of the 8 months after her diagnosis. Emotionally draining.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@winchesterwoman 2yrs is very fresh. Mine's been gone over 7 now. Went into a deep depression for a 1 1/2 after the 1st year anniversary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@winchesterwoman I know. Everything can change when your mom dies. It's like their death can suck the life out of you. I still struggle...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@winchesterwoman I've backed off as well. I have RP'd - collaboritive fan-fic writing, but as a certain character :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@winchesterwoman Good! lol  Listen to the song 'Pieces' by Red and tell me it doesn't suit Dean! :) So you write fanfic?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@winchesterwoman Very cool, another SPN fan who's also a Christian! From Tennessee...would you be a fan of Red, Building 429, Newsboys... :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shemarmoore @Gublernation Just watched an old epi of #CriminalMinds I hadn't seen about Sarah Jean. Brought me to tears!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dhewlett That's a good look for you...very handsome, you know, in an icky sort of way :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jasonmanns I'm mystified that you have mastered the ability to fold the bed sheet, if it is the wretched bottom one you're refering to. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jessegarcia429 Have fun sweetie &amp; Happy belated NewYear! All the best with many blessings from God in 2013 as you continue working for Him!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPNimpalagirl Happy belated NewYear! Wish I could view your tumblr on my phone but it takes to much bandwidth. Are you on facebook as well?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@winchesterbros But of course! There is no competition ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danieldepp500 @thehobbitmovie Yes, 'breathtaking' is definitely the perfect word for The Silmarrilion &lt;3 Tolkien changed my life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanneelHarris Happy belated New Year to you and Jensen, and all the best to you both for 2013! :) xxoo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Favorite #Tolkien quote: Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? ........<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@molliebaggins Really? I do love Thorin, but I'm not feeling it like I did with LOTR. Still, there's two more movies to suck me in :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattnathanson I happen to think "Kept"&amp;"Illusions" have the best lyrics. They are frequently played on my phone:)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@colbiecaillat Aww....makes me miss my Golden...Lily. Lost her over 2yrs ago. They are beautiful aren't they :)<|endoftext|>
