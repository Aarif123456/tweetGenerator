<|startoftext|>Good luck with that program.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So glad you are ok. I don't think alot of people realize how many millions of Americans, adults and children are food insecure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most do but you see the Trumpers here don't care because they are so brain washed,  uneducated,  and a member of Trumps cult.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr @GOP @realDonaldTrump this is one part of your legacy.  Bet none of you feel any thing because it doesn't affect you. You are all useless, greedy, and power hungry but there will be a special place in hell for every single one you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amazing how these people got through school.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would have fired his ass a long time ago. Book smart no common sense.  It's a warning sign when a doc starts down playing the virus. Time to find a new doc. My opinion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No surprise.  According to him every thing is fine. Nothing exists in Trump world but filing phony lawsuits and spewing his continuous rhetoric, lies, propaganda and bat shit craziness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump WTF is wrong with you? 260,000 Americans are dead, food lines miles long, unemployment is at an all time high, millions unemployed,  a virus out of control and you're still passing and moaning,  filing useless lawsuits and not not helping anyone. #ByeDonnie<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And the stupidity, greed, and selfishness continues. This is why we are in the position we are in. Parents who don't care, don't believe,  and cities with no balls to stop the events.

<|startoftext|>#CrookedPerdue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is true. Food banks are in trouble trying to get food to all who come. The lines here in Erie County,  PA have been heartbreaking because @GOP @senatemajldr chose to ignore the people and confirm judges. #MoscowMitch will be enjoying his expensive meal tomorrow.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HuffmanForNC is so right. I don't care about the stock market but I do care about waiting for unemployment in the state of PA for 4 months for which you get the run around after hitting redial 200 times to be put on hold for another 1 hour.  @GovernorTomWolf your system sucks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely.  Here our positivity rate in Erie County,  PA is 12.6%. And they refuse to wear them and  make fun of those who do. Well, I want to hear their last words as they get intubated and placed on a vent.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr you are living on another planet.  You, Trump and the @GOP have proven you gave up on the virus months ago. 251,000 Americans are dead. The virus is surging.  Hospitals are at max. So stop denying the transition.  You are all complicit in crimes against humanity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only place @realDonaldTrump should get his picture is on a roll of toilet paper. Then people can use it accordingly.  Trump isn't deserving of anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan is a Republican puppet of Trumps. He doesn't care if you live or die. He is complicit in 251,000 Americans dying. He doesn't believe people should wear masks or anything else. He is a loser like Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GSAEmily your resume will not get you a job as a proper scooper for your deliberate refusal to assist in the transition.  You are also complicit in Trumps Crimes against humanity.  Good luck with your job hunt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump is a loser. Now the press needs to stop coddling the toddler in the WH and start asking serious questions of all Republicans who are now complicit with all of Trumps heinous crimes against humanity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They all should be @GOP it is now  negligent homicide and crimes against humanity. They are all co-conspirators and have been complicit the entire time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @GOP this is your irresponsible and dangerous reaction to the virus.  You are all guilty of negligent homicide and crimes against humanity for 251,000 Americans dead and growing daily. You are not pro life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They were all over in PA from August on with all this crap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan you are endangering every one with your bat shit craziness.  251,000, Americans dead is a good reason to stop your lies. The virus is surging because of you and all @GOP . You are killing Americans with your lies and denying.  It is time you were voted out of office.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump you LOST. You are pathetic. Stop with the lies, propaganda, rhetoric, and bat shit craziness.  YOU'RE FIRED..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely the #GrifterInChief is still grifting..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GSAEmily good luck with that. You'll be looking for a long time after your unwillingness to move the transition forward. I wouldn't hire you I know that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump who gives a rat's ass about space when you and your co-conspirators @GOP have killed 250,000 Americans,  #COVID19 is surging across this country,  hospitals are overflowing,  people are losing their homes and people are hungry because you could NOT do your job.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And meanwhile in the US @realDonaldTrump is golfing. He acknowledges nothing of the pandemic,  the surge in cases, hospitals over flowing,  deaths mounting, and the fact he and his @GOP have killed over 240,000 Americans and counting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They were blowing smoke. It is Sunday and it's status quo. Once again their words mean nothing.  More lies and bat shit craziness while people are dying, the virus is surging,  ICU beds are filling up across the country and other health care professionals are pushed to rhe max.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump is this rounding the corner? You said it would magically disappear. Well, you need to concede so we can get this national health crisis under control.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump you need a new talking point. Safest election in history.  YOU'RE FIRED.  Time to man up, concede, and move on because you have been worthless for 4 years. 240,000 Americans are dead thanks to you and your co-conspirators @GOP .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why should he? He and his @GOP co-conspirators had no plans for dealing with any of this. And they still don't.  Trump is golfing and #MoscowMitch is confirming judges while we, the people,  get sick and die, worry about eviction,  car payments,  being homeless and hungry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes and and all 3 are now dead because @realDonaldTrump lied, denied to provide hospitals with what they needed, and then continued to lie and deny.

<|startoftext|>I do understand because we have a government who doesn't give a rat's ass and yes everyone is over worked, getting sick and yes our medical personnel are dying. Thank you for what you do but until people recognize this is only getting worse they will be selfish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please take care of yourself and your family.  Thank you for what you do. I know it's difficult.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If people would just wear masks, stop gathering in large numbers,  stop going to bars and restaurants because they have been proven to be contributing to the spread, and stop being selfish we could manage but people would rather die than do what is required.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump how can you stand and salute when you never had the balls to serve in the military. You have insulted and disgraced our military for years. Please #ResignNow.The gig is up so just pack your bags and go away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump NO VOTER FRAUD IN PA.  #ResignNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trouble in Paradise as Proud Boys go full on Neo-Nazi with ONLY WHITES allowed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump your bat shit craziness is apparently getting the best of you. The entire CON is getting old and frankly we are all tired of the same shit day after day. Why don't you put your energy into working on #COVID19 instead of spewing your rhetoric.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#OperationWarpConcede<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jessicam6946 you are 100% correct.  I have been very vocal about masks because people are ignorant and selfish.  I get frustrated because they don't get it. Until the reality of sickness and death happens to them they will continue to be reckless with no thought of others.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnFetterman our Lt. Governor in PA calls out @DanPatrick for his offer of $1M for reporting voter fraud.  Got to love it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But there is another one started by Veritas on GiveSendGo that we didn't know about here in Erie. Guess they thought they'd give it another try after GoFundMe shut that one down minutes after the Washington Post broke the story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kayleighmcenany  Stop with the lies,rhetoric, propaganda, and bat shit craziness.  #ByeKayleigh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am so sorry.  Sending prayers.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Nope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No I have been in jail but I believe Twitter should suspend all of the Trump Crime Syndicate Accounts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ky_Gill28 @WhFactcheck The GoFundMe page was deactivated not even 5 minutes after the story broke in the Washington Post. I live in Erie and as far as everyone knows he DID NOT get the money from the GoFundMe he set up.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#COVID19 @realDonaldTrump @VP this is your mess. Pence just walked away, Trump has done nothing and Americans are sick and dying. 99,000 new cases today, 239,000 Americans dead and climbing.  These are human lives they are playing with.  https://t.co/n5Wb8K0qyG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BREAKING NEWS. From Erie, PA Richard Hopkins, the mail carrier is calling out the Washington Post for saying he recanted his story. He released this YouTube video moments ago saying HE DID NOT RECANT. So now it's he said vs. The Washington Post.   https://t.co/FPmS3nJLTm<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The GOP donors were in a GoFundMe page that Richard Hopkins set up for himself.  It raised over $136,000 before being shut down minutes after his recant hit the news. I live in Erie and have been following this non stop. The whole thing was initiated by Project Veritas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Attention Georgia..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano @MalcolmNance in Erie, PA after being confronted with federal Investigators the mailman  admitted he fabricated the whole thing. Mean while,  a GoFundMe that he started raised $136,000 was just now removed. I live here and have been following this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The shit never stops. We have  National Security issues here.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC They have no proof. He's spewing rhetoric, lies, lies and bat shit craziness.  His postal worker in Erie, PA recanted his story.  He fabricated it. The postal worker lied and well Donnie you have nothing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JasonMillerinDC are you that stupid.  Puerto Rico has no votes. Read all the information before spewing rhetoric, lies, propaganda and bullshit.  This has nothing to do with the President. And by the way, TRUMP LOST you moron.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mikepompeo is another candidate for treasonous behavior and spreading lies, rhetoric, propaganda and bat shit.  Another fat, old, white dude who thinks an authoritarian dictator is what we need. @realDonaldTrump lost and #BidenWonToday so get over it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenJohnThune why are you spewing rhetoric, lies, propaganda and bat shit?  #BidenWonToday and the people have spoken.  We do not what the @GOP is pushing. Death, division,  hatred, greed, and cruelty. I suggest you do some reflection because your values suck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>They will not. They have enabled him and will continue do so as Trump burns the country down before he leaves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the next election to win. We need the two seats in the senate and we need the people to vote at the run off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think the networks are being careful because of the amount of lawsuits Trump has filed. He has filed them in every state that is still counting.  I don't think they want to give Trump any ammunition to use in his lawsuits.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RickSantorum they have had 4 years to protect democracy,  denounce white supremacy, denounce racism. They chose to buy the con and now must face the consequences. Trump has incited his base and continues to do so. Sorry I don't buy your BS..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>COVID is uncontrollable in this country.  There will be a lag between the cases and death but the deaths will be enormous.  It has not gone away and the country is hurting because @GOP and @realDonaldTrump have allowed it to continue spreading and killing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This piece of garbage needs to be removed from office and charged with making terroristic threats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If he's still flopping on his back I have my doubts and if we get really blessed #TrumpForPrison2020 he won't be running for anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely. A run off in January 2021 to take back the Senate.  There is still a lot of work to do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump that's not a problem for me. Frankly I'm tired of seeing and hearing you. As America has spoken, so clearly and loudly, YOU'RE FIRED. It has been 4 years of living with a DV abuser and it has finally ended. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnJamesMI such a shame you chose to align yourself with a party @GOP that has become infected with TRUMPISM,  racism,  white supremacy, 240,000 deaths from COVID, surging uncontrolled across our country. You chose to destroy democracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump give it up. Lawyer up and pack up your lies, rhetoric,  propaganda and bat shit craziness, moving day is closer than you think. #TrumpCrimeFamily is officially FIRED.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does this insanity go away or is TRUMPISM going to be a thing that will be with us for a long time to come.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here in PA, the Republicans in the House and Senate in Harrisburg doing Trumps bidding made it so the mail in votes could not be counted until after the polls closed.  It is the Republicans who created this mess. So that's why we are in the mess we are in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The nightmare isn't over yet until #TrumpIsACriminal is removed from the peoples house. He still has until Jan.2021 to do an insurmountable damage to this country that he hasn't done already.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember this..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnFetterman always has a way with the truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well either he did alot of fornication or he believed Trump that it was a hoax. Either way it didn't work out well for him.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yes..hell yes..that's karma..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump 100,000 cases today, 1600 deaths. 235,000 Americans dead and it getting worse. If you had worked as hard in  stopping COVID as you are working to file all these fucking frivolous lawsuits we would be in much better shape  and less death.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good she's getting an assault charge. Glad that officer did it right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They are getting violent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yep.  #DejoyIsACriminal #DeJoyForPrison<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another political hack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TwitterSupport these tweets are getting unhinged.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IT'S the same reason they believe COVID is a hoax,Mexico paid for the wall, the economy is great, all Democrats are socialists, white supremacy is great, the Confederacy is still alive,  BLM is a terrorist organization...TRUMP sold them HIS CON. TRUMPISM..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listen up media...start calling it what is..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fire his ass immediately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kayleighmcenany you don't pick what ballots to count and not count.  The people vote and will be heard. You are a disgrace to the entire country.  Not sure how you sleep at night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes @NikkiHaley did have but she sold her soul and career to @realDonaldTrump who then trashed and burned her like he does everything else. She has no credibility left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am so sorry.  Sending prayers and condolences.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRickWilson and Lincoln Project did an amazing job with everything they did. Seriousness with tears and a touch of laughter for sure. I lost 2 former co-workers and a friend to COVID. Thank you for all you do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader I'm sure your boss appreciates all your lies and bat shit craziness but you know ALL votes are legal. There is no problem except you, @realDonaldTrump and the rest of the GOP pushing your propaganda,  rhetoric,  lies, and bullshit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TrumpIsALaughingStock and no thank you for another go round with your white supremacist ass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump all you are doing is screwing with a system that has no problems except you. You can't and won't except the fact that the people don't want you or your crime family. Stop the bat shit craziness and MAN UP.   https://t.co/nm1rxumUls<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These people are a disgrace to our democracy and this country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TrumpIsANationalDisgrace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely priceless. Another argument goes down the drain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DejoyIsACriminal #DeJoyForPrison<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another nut case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimondsDeb You are correct about this POS in PA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepBenninghoff Well, the Republicans in the House and Senate in PA voted that mail in ballots couldn't be counted until after the election ended. It's not the Democrats It's the Republicans who did this to help Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just throw all their asses in jail and stop this freaking circus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TrumpCrimeFamily<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But Trump claims to have done so much for the black and brown community.  White supremacy and racism is what Trump has left. #TrumpIsALaughingStock We should all be afraid of what he and his cult are capable of. #TrumpIsUnfitForOffice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump COVID has not disappeared as you said. Cases are surging, deaths are increasing and you have done NOTHING.  You are a fucking monster who doesn't value human life, 235,000 Americans dead, and the only one you care about is yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But Trump said it would be gone the day after the election.  The virus is spreading and mutating. Cases are increasing every where and deaths are rising.  WEAR YOUR MASK, SOCIAL DISTANCING,  WASH YOUR HANDS, AVOID LARGE GATHERINGS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DejoyIsACriminal #DeJoyForPrison<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is lunacy at its best. This is what Trump and his GOP has unleashed on Americans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I too am sorry for your loss. Sending prayers and condolences.  I am even more  angry that 60 some million people who voted do not care. I am angry alot lately because people don't care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's make this law firm famous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How stupid are the 60 some million who voted for Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These people are ignorant,  uneducated,  and misinformed thanks to Trump and his bullshit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trumps white supremacists are following his orders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr all votes need to be counted. You are spreading lies, propaganda, rhetoric and bat shit. You don't get to pick what votes you want and don't want. This a democracy.  If you don't like it move to Russia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump the people have a right to vote and have their vote counted. You are spreading lies, propaganda,  rhetoric and bat shit craziness to keep your white supremacist base happy. #TrumpIsLosing #TrumpIsPathetic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec belongs in jail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TrumpIsALaughingStock  #TrumpIsPathetic<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Another tragedy that didn't have to happen.  Sending prayers and contains.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RudyGiuliani needs to go away. He's has no credibility and his rhetoric and bullshit contains nothing useful or truthful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump supporter...Lord help us because that is what they are like here in my little corner of PA..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely thank you..beautiful..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump you are now worried about integrity...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the New Republican party..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We all knew but it is so exhausting with the entire #TrumpCrimeFamily tweeting bat shit craziness along with FOX News spewing their shit. I pray this freaking nightmare ends soon. Trump is attacking our Governor in PA and threatening lawsuits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is what Trump is inciting..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Screw Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ban their accounts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump you are a fucking authoritarian dictator who will not silence our vote in PA. We have a right to have our ballots counted and it is not up to the courts or you to decide.   https://t.co/PKIgkiMgfT  ( Sent from YourErie 2Go )<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another tragic loss that didn't have to be. @realDonaldTrump this is your mess. You lied, denied and people are dying because of your fucking incompetentence and no caring about human life. #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TrumpIsPathetic #TrumpForPrison2020 #TrumpCrimeFamilyForPrison<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our Governor @GovernorTomWolf has been attacked by Trump and his Republican Crime Syndicate in the PA senate and house since the pandemic began. Wolf has stood against these attacks and has always stood for the people of PA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DeJoyForPrison<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElieNYC I agree. After seeing the numbers it has nothing to do with COVID,  tax returns,  crimes against humanity,  or anything else. It is racism, white supremacy, and greed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn, he's another liar and useless politician.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@newtgingrich is having a tantrum like Trump.  He is a washed up politician who lives at FOX spreading lies, rhetoric,  propaganda and bat shit craziness.  Time for him to sit and  shut up. He has nothing useful or truthful to say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I so agree with her. I can't believe there are so many in this country that voted for Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump . We the people have a right to vote and a right to be heard. You have stolen 4 years from us, 235,000 Americans have died because of your fucking incompetentence and 3 friends of mine died from COVID because you didn't do shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#FuckTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DeJoyForPrison<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These people are freaking nuts but Trump loves them. They are, along with Trump, the reason there are lies, rhetoric,  propaganda,  and bat shit craziness in our society.  They feed into the white supremacists and conspiracy theories that the Trumpers love.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love our Lt. Governor,  @FettermanLt . He calls it as it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where are the ballots?? Can they be counted if found?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope Casey is right because here in Erie, PA Trump has 60 percent of vote to Bidens 38 percent. The people in this county are unbelievable in their support for Trump.  They are dangerous to people who wear masks and frankly they are scary individuals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maine is out of their mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DeJoyForPrison the only good place for this piece of crap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So where are they and do they get counted? People voted and they should be counted and then change DeJoy with obstruction or tampering with the mail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#HereRightMatters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump can have all the freaking tantrums he wants. #CountEveryVote is democracy working and he can lie, deny, gaslight, spew his rhetoric, propaganda, and bullshit but he doesn't call the election.  He is the biggest con ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure they get it but they will when their checks stop coming and they all have to go back to work at 70 years old or older under Trump and his Republican Crime Syndicate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These people need to stop spewing rhetoric, propaganda, lies and bullshit.  #CountEveryVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This piece of garbage needs to be in jail with the rest of the Trump Republican Crime Syndicate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's the question I have. It is horrifying to think these people want 4 more years of this bat shit craziness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Newt Gingrich is an idiot. PA is not stealing anything.  Typical bat shit craziness from a washed up politician who has to live at FOX News to peddle his Republican bullshit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have these ballots been removed and counted?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump #CountEveryVote that's the way it is in this country.  You don't determine who won. We the people decide with every vote counts. My greatest prayer is that you and your white supremacist GOP will be packing your shit and leaving.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. For those who voted for Trump from Mary Trump..this is what you get.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovernorTomWolf what 2 cases does Trump have in  the Supreme Court today that affect our votes in PA?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't believe people in this country want 4 more years of this shit show.  An authoritarian dictator,  white supremacists,  kids in cages, more death from this freaking virus, no health care, no social security,  no Medicare.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is disgusting..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Trump is mocking 214,000 Americans that are dead. More will die because we do not have the medical care he is afforded and our insurance will not cover those meds. He is killing people by his reckless and dangerous words. He is lying to people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This so called doctor sold his soul and reputation to Trump.  He is no longer a respected member of the medical community. He broke his oath, DO NO HARM when he lied and let #TrumpJoyRide and endanger so many plus 2 secret service members.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unfortunately normal working people have nothing.  If we are lucky enough to have health care #Trump is destroying that on Nov.10. 210,000 Americans dead,  2 of my former co-workers and #Trump doesn't give a shit about any of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump this is a dangerous,  reckless and sick response.  210,000 Americans dead and you have done nothing. Now you think you've a freaking authority on COVID-19.  You are a weak, a coward who knows nothing. #COVID19 #TrumpLiesAmericansDie #VoteHimOut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TrumpsCult will buy his bullshit 100%  214,000 Americans will tell you differently.  His cult puts all of us in danger every day and they will continue to do so because they believe Trumps lies and rhetoric.  Trump is mass murderer who must be charged as such.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>214,000 Americans are dead because of #Trump and his lies and bullshit.  Normal people do not get the meds he does because our insurance will not pay. Nov.10th we will not have any insurance because Trump is going to destroy it. You tell me, is America great?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For #Trump to say this is irresponsible and dangerous.  214,000 Americans are dead. 2 of my co-workers died at the beginning of this because #TrumpKnewAndDidNothing .He is a fucking monster who will keep on killing until he is removed from office.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But #Trump hasn't learned shit. He is still reckless and dangerous.  That #TrumpJoyRide put the lives of 2 secret service agents in danger. They will have to quarantine and they could get sick and yes die. Trump doesn't give a shit..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSignorile #RoseGardenMassacre<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump you are a f**king monster.

<|startoftext|>As with everything #Trump touches he destroys.This doctor sold his soul to Trump and now his reputation and career are in the crapper. Dr. Conley broke his oath DO NO HARM when he lied and allowed that circus drive around..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump is now a fucking authority on #COVID19 ? This is so false. He doesn't know shit as he has proved for 4 years. 214,000 Americans dead, the economy is dead, he's lied, denied and continues to do so.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If that is true the hospital is complicit in spreading this shit #Trump #LiesAfterLies .I find it hard to believe that they would endanger the patients to this fucking moron but look at what they did with him going for a ride.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No pity party for #Trump. He did this to himself and the entire country. He has killed 214,000, 000 Americans including 2 of my previous co-workers. So he can rot in hell with his entire Republican cesspool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TrumpVirus #TrumpIsALoser Everyone who is involved with #Trump is complicit in 214,000 Americans dead. The doctors that allowed this have no business being doctors because they violated their oath, DO NO HARM. #Trump only cares about himself and no one else.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#TrumpHasCovid has no concern about anyone or anything but himself..his reckless behavior and ignorance are deadly....he didn't care if Bidens team knew or not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well they have masks but that's like locking the barn after the horse gets out..I'm sorry no empathy or sympathy here..he did this to himself and 210,000 Americans that are dead..I lost 3 people because  #TrumpLiedPeopleDied ..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy crap..#Trump recorded this just before leaving for Walter Reed.. He's alive and talking..looks alittle off color..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Again, #Trump doesn't give a shit about anything or anyone but himself...this is selfish behavior from a narcissistic sociopathic individual..he has no one to blame but himself and his Republican enablers who have now killed 210,000 Americans..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#COVID19 is a cluster in the WH..this is a continuation of the reckless and dangerous disregard for human life..210,000 Americans dead and its obvious #Trump does not give a shit about anything or anyone but himself..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I am all out of sympathy and empathy because #Trump lied and denied   your entire family did not follow the rules  and #TrumpLiedPeopleDied with 210,000 Americans dead because #Trump didn't give a shit..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are you shitting me, #Trump knew what to do in February.  He chose to ignore the warnings, chose to deny science and data and then #TrumpLiedPeopleDied and then continued to lie and deny then #TrumpVirus killed 210,000 Americans..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kelly is a vile and a sad person China did not do this..#Trump did this to himself and the 210,000 Americans dead..you are disgusting and a Trump enabler..you do not deserve to be a representative for the people because you do not represent the people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Honestly I don't think he's walking..if he has a fever and a cough plus they gave him that cocktail I am not so sure he can navigate on his own..my experience most need a stretcher ...#COVID19 #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hydroxycholoquin does nothing for #COVID ..not approved treatment for COVID per the FDA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The most protected man lied and denied since Feb. #Trump has shown no leadership and refused to take control of the virus..#Trump did this to himself and this country..all he had to do was wear a mask and follow the science and data..he did nothing..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just unbelievable..the entire Trump family and Republican cesspool have all contributed to this...nothing but denial and lies...they have all been reckless and dangerous in all of their behavior..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes they did..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From my experience with #Covid patients this is what we were seeing in some cases rapid progression in older patients with co-morbidities..They said he had a dose of an experimental cocktail so with that they could be anticipating side effects..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Such freaking idiots..they are daring the virus to get them..and now we know why they don't give a shit about 210,000 Americans dead..Trump knew in February so he did this to himself by denying science and data..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's hard to deny when you see videos of that party they had at the White House on Saturday for that new judge  and the number of people there who now are infected..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonnyJackson4TX You need to stop the lies and bullshit.. Your tweet is all lies...you are spreading misinformation that can harm alot of people..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely true..for them to think of this things could be worse because they couldn't pay me enough either because the treatment could be worse than the virus..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would imagine he will be separated from them..I'm sure he will not be well received..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donwinslow @MSignorile trying to confirm<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>More positive #COVID tests coming..210,000 Americans dead and yet they continue to infect people..I have no sympathy or empathy at this point because #TrumpLiedPeopleDied #COVID19 #TrumpVirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These people are absolute fucking idiots..what don't they get..they deny protecting themselves and it's been proven since February they can't be trusted to do anything for the American people..210,000 Americans dead means they don't give a shit..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am constantly reminded of the 7M plus infected, 210,000 Americans dead, and #TrumpLiedPeopleDied along with all his Republican enablers are complicit.  I have no sympathy or empathy because #Trump knew, continued his reckless and dangerous behavior..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This would explain maybe his severe sweating..if he wasn't tested he could have been positive Tuesday night..#TrumpHasCovid #TrumpVirus #TrumpFailed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman  Stop inflating numbers..the economy is in the crapper because @realDonaldTrump has done nothing to contain and control this virus..these aren't new jobs and there aren't that many..#TrumpVirus #TrumpHasCovid #TrumpFailed<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Stupidity is not a defense..@realDonaldTrump and his enablers knew in February and lied and denied..you cannot believe shit coming out of the WH...they have infected so many people and some will probably die..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These Republican enablers and #Trump are all complicit in this..do you know how many people are involved here..this is reckless and dangerous behavior..210,000 Americans dead and @realDonaldTrump doesn't give a shit about any of them or any of us..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Hannity and Fox are as complicit as #Trump and the Republican cesspool for over 7M infections and 210,000 Americans dead..they are all complicit in crimes against humanity and negligent homicide..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is straight to the point @realDonaldTrump is an authoritarian dictator who will stop at nothing to destroy this country. The entire Republican cesspool must be removed November 3rd.. #VoteBidenHarris2020  #VoteHimOut<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TimNoEgo Prayers..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We cannot stop the campaign.  We must continue..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably the switch board operator knowing this administration..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>210,000 Americans dead, 7M  infected and @realDonaldTrump has lied and denied since Feb...I have no sympathy or empathy at this point. @realDonaldTrump knew the science and denied it along with all his Republican enablers  .#TrumpVirus #TrumpLiedPeopleDied<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cannot stop now..we are fighting for our democracy and freedom.. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare  #VoteHimOut<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Another stupid shit who should stick  to reporting dumpster fires..just spreading lies, propaganda, rhetoric and bat shit..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did you expect anything else from @realDonaldTrump because this is the #DemocraticHoax ..he has derailed every agency on dealing with #COVID19 and we have 210,000 Americans dead and it doesn't phase him...he  doesn't believe in science or contact tracing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kilmeade is spewing rhetoric, lies, propaganda and bullshit...listen to the science and data..not @realDonaldTrump and @kilmeade they will kill you..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely correct.  Unless it comes from Walter Reed it will be deemed questionable because the quack doctor in the WH can't be trusted..remembering 210,000 Americans dead because @realDonaldTrump lied and denied. #TrumpCovid #TrumpVirus #TrumpFailed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, because @realDonaldTrump will brag that he survived and it wasn't any worse than a cold and therefore it won't hurt people to get it. #TrumpVirus #TrumpFailed #TrumpCovid #TrumpLiedPeopleDied<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ATTENTION PA VOTERS Your Republican representatives in Harrisburg are up to no good in  supporting Trump and disregarding the wishes of the people.#Pennsylvania   https://t.co/lYQ8Tiprvm<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I have lost 3  friends to COVID .two were former co-workers and one a long time friend because @realDonaldTrump lied and denied..#TrumpVirus #COVID19 #TrumpLiedPeopleDied #TrumpCovid  remember 210,000 Americans deads..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Sorry..at this point I have no sympathy or empathy because 7M infections,  210,000 Americans dead and @realDonaldTrump still lies and denies..#TrumpVirus #COVID19 #TrumpHasCovid #TrumpLiedPeopleDied<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All medical news should come from Walter Reed and not that quack in the White House..  7M infections, 210,000 Americabs dead.and he still denies and lies. #TrumpLiedPeopleDied     #COVID19 #TrumpHasCovid #TrumpVirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Over 7 million infected,  210,000 Americans dead and @realDonaldTrump and his Republican cesspool continue the lies and propaganda..this superspreader deal could hurt so many and he doesn't give a shit..#TrumpHasCovid #TrumpVirus #TrumpLiedPeopleDied #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Republicans and Trump knew so they will reap what they sow..Superspreader events daily in WH.. #TrumpVirus #TrumpFailed #TrumpHasCovid #TrumpLiedPeopleDied #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As I say karma's a bitch.. whether reports are true or not remains to be seen due to @realDonaldTrump does not know what truth is...7M  infections , 210,000 Americans dead and I have no sympathy or empathy at this point..#TrumpVirus #TrumpLiedPeopleDied<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not rejoicing..remembering the 7 million infected,  210,000 Americans dead because of @realDonaldTrump and his refusal to do anything to protect the people.. #TrumpVirus #COVID19 #TrumpHasCovid #TrumpLiedPeopleDied<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No postponement...we have been voting and will continue to vote.. #VoteHimOut #VoteBlue2020 #VoteBidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tell that to the 7 million who had it, the 210,000 Americans that are dead, Herman Cain, and his cult..Lets not forget that Trump and his Republican cesspool have been lying and denying since Feb. #COVID19 #TrumpHasCovid #TrumpVirus #TrumpLiedPeopleDied<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So this is the time line according to the news report..I still find it suspicious at best..  https://t.co/Q1LkJVDDtJ #TrumpVirus #TrumpHasCovid #COVID19 #TrumpLiedPeopleDied<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Again 210,000 Americans dead, over 7 million infected and I have no sympathy or empathy at this point for the him and the Republican cesspool who did nothing to help . #COVID19 #TrumpVirus #TrumpHasCovid #TrumpLiedPeopleDied<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As I said I find no sympathy or empathy at this point because I am reminded of the 7 million Americans infected and the 210,000 Americans dead because of him and the Republicans incompetent response to the virus.. #TrumpVirus  #TrumpHasCovid  #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Completely irresponsible,  reckless and dangerous..but Trump doesn't care who he infects and who dies.. #TrumpVirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The time line I question but I also find no sympathy or empathy as I am reminded of the 7 million infections in this country and the 210,000 Americans that died and he continued with his super spreader events endangering every one..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>October surprise or just bullshit..either way Trump and his Republican cesspool are responsible for over 7 million infections and over 210,000 Americans dead so I have no sympathy or empathy for any of them at this point..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Again at this point his actions have infected over 7 million Americans and have killed over 210,000 Americans so if you want sympathy or empathy from me it won't happen..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump as infected over 7 million Americans and has killed over 210,000 Americans so at this point I have no sympathy or empathy for anyone connected with his grifter organization..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grandmagrit Vile..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Again he doesn't care who he infects or how many die...he only does what serves him best and to hell with everyone else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For one, I wouldn't trust anything that this monster promotes. It's to soon for a vaccine that would work and it must be thoroughly tested with all health conditions for side  effects and with drug interactions and with side effects on all ages.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TrumpVirus  While the timing of this is suspicious I, at this moment,  have no sympathy or empathy at this point.  If it is true I am reminded that 210,000 Americans have died because of his and his Republican cesspools incompetent and reckless actions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPACEFORCE_CDR Prayers..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just awesome..so she was spreading it in PA too..these people are deadly and dangerous..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A little to late..you all deserve to be voted out in November<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One ass speaking of another ass..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But how many other people did she infect..all those people on Air Force 1, the people in Cleveland where they all refused to wear masks..I'm afraid alot of innocent people could possibly be infected because of their reckless and dangerous behavior.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well..well..super spreader event on Air Force 1 plus the people in Cleveland and the Trump trash refused to wear madks in the debate...there could be so many people infected..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He might but given his medical issues it wouldn't be wise but between his evil sperm doctor and his quack radiologist it's possible..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Things are getting worse for her..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You can't excuse any of this. Trump has shown us who he is for over 4 years..there is no spin, no gaslighting,  no nothing..he is a racist,  a white supremacist and a dictator in training...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Couldn't come soon enough..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No one can control Trump...Trump can't control himself and when pushed he becomes more abusive and vile..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You were not alone..I too was reminded of the same last night. Trump is your classic example of a DV psychological abuser...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That in it self is unforgivable...people who live in glass houses should not throw stones ..Trump has a son who obviously has a serious drug issue that is on full display daily..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>He is one sick puppy..and the thing is his cultists believe every damn word..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But Trump said he was draining the swamp...I think he was confused because the swamp has turned into the cesspool..<|endoftext|>
