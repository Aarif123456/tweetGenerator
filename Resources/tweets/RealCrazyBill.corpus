<|startoftext|>@Playboi_Tino Horrible title... even for his gimmick.  https://t.co/NvgloMIQOa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never forget that Kelly dated Jeff... she was 17, he was 20-something. #Pedo #SavedByTheBell @eentertainment<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JsmallSAINTS #WWETLC  https://t.co/OugEZT56ES<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So glad I turned the TV on and it's the Hawaii episodes of #SavedByTheBell  Thank you @eentertainment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I dunno. I think Kaylee used too many gumdrops, but I do love it! #Sheetzmas  https://t.co/wXsB9oSZyM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Such a GREAT Movie!    "One plus two plus one plus one"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They keep talking about Bey and Swan slowing down the match compared to what they're used to...That's the WWE effect.  Big guys in the main, with the title, can't move as the 200lb guys can. Impact is trying to treat them as such. #Shame #FinalResolution<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HAWT DAMN! It's SaturBEY and we're ready for the @IMPACTWRESTLING main event at #FinalResolution<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know that @DashingChrisBey is BAE, right? Sorry Swann... #FinalResolution<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThePWTruth Whoa!  That's some Rick Rude shit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HAWT DAMN!  Is The North going to break up?! #FinalResolution<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Asked for @JRsBBQ for Christmas... that JR Ketchup goes on EVERYTHING. Not to mention that BBQ sauce... HAWT DANG!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love The North so much!  But let's be honest, they would both be amazing single superstars... Ethan Page could easily be the face of the company! #FinalResolution<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Impact is awesome. They came to AXS and I could watch. I gave them a chance from the old TNA... #TheDraw @TheSamiCallihan and #TheNorth @OfficialEGO and @Walking_Weapon  were the reason I kept watching at first.... now they're ALL killing it #FinalResolution<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This guy... BITW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THAT'S GOTTA BE MANIC! THAT'S GOTTA BE MANIC!!!  "Manic" about to wreck Rohit and I love it! #FinalResolution<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WN_Net I hope it's Suicide, then he wins and unmasks to find out he's actually TJP!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man, the world has been sleeping on Eric Young since his time with Team Canada... Petey Williams, Bobby Roode, D'Amore... Eric Young is GREATNESS! #FinalResolution #IMPACTonAXSTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't believe Tommy Dreamer is still a thing in 2020... he can go though! For sure! #FinalResolution<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just had to sign up again for the free trial this time, through @FiteTV ... Thank you!  Suck it, @IMPACTWRESTLING<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Go to  https://t.co/9Snq1XqgL1"  Yeah, it's a 404. Page not found. Suck on my nuts, @IMPACTWRESTLING  I want my $10 back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone else sign up for Impact Plus and then get told you're not subscribed?!  It's only $10, but it's $10 out of my pocket as I try to make ends meet.  Thanks @IMPACTWRESTLING<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FiteTV LOL everyone wants to act like WWE didn't miss a beat... No missed shows AT ALL... they kept me going.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WHO'S YOUR FAVORITE: Aside from big names like Pillman Jr, Teddy Hart, Zack Sabre, etc...  Who are your favorite local indy peeps? 1or 10 of them...Tag them if you can!   In PA: Madd Maxx Morrison, Mambo Italiano, Andrew Palace, Joe Perfect, Manic...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheClosedFist I liked them after they won the Dusty Classic, showed they learned and grew A LOT from just squash matches... But still, there's a LOT of talk about them being dangerous in that ring and hurting people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kelly_Button Fact! It's the only time I can actually pull off the Cupid Shuffle... sometimes I can even dougie.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WrestlingGuy435 @WrestleCritic Omega is great, but it's all Styles. He's been top dog since his Rumble debut(and before tbh)  Omega can get there though, for sure!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FiteTV As Michael Cole would say: "That's vintage DX"  Amazing night during the Monday Night Wars!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobbieSE @FiteTV Can't even debate it. Triggering the Monday Night Wars was 100% the biggest moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FiteTV Recent? Like in the past two years?  I gotta go with @IWCwrestling in the Pittsburgh, PA area, and @CWFHollywood<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These guys are fantastic! Check em out on YT.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Someone complained about WWE being in Tropicana Field. Doesn't matter. This is 100% a set-up for them to find a way to have fans at #WrestleMania so let's all just chill out for lil' bit! #SmackDown #WWERaw #WWE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@x_Beast17_x There is no "World TItle" anymore... sooo....  https://t.co/4sJKRDfpaK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know how you can be all "Man I love T &amp; A" and then turn around and think Sasha is a smoke show... #SmackDown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can we get an "I AM SAMI ZAYN" T-shirt now? @SamiZayn  @WWEShop  #SmackDown #IAMSAMIZAYN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's so WWE to build up a match for a PPV then do it right before the PPV... #SmackDown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The thing with Keith Lee is that he's #Limitless .... He LOVES people that tell him "no" or "You can't" because he's going to shut them all up... including you, Vince McMahon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course I turn #SmackDown on as Sasha is coming out. I really couldn't care less about her vs Carmella... #WWETLC is looking hella good though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dang... RIP Deebo. Time to put on and watch No Holds Barred.  #ZEUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HAWT DAMN! I told you Kross was gonna kill Priest!  Gargano killed it on the mic too! #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Triple Threat tag with the Grizzled Young Vets? HAWT DAMN! They're going to WRECK Ever Rise and Imperium #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh God... Kross is going to KILL Damien Priest.  #WWENXT #FallAndPray #TickTock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OH SHIT!!!  Scarlett is wayyyy too hot!  #WWENXT #FallAndPray<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OH SNAP!  Triple threat, Preist vs Dunne vs KOR?!  Winner gets Finn?  Or maybe a fatal four way?!  Got my mouth waterin' #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love Finn!  Now Pete Dunne coming out to confront him?! HAWT DAMN! #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IAmJericho @TalkIsJericho You got AC Slater?!  https://t.co/6JxIRorR5q<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone know who won KOTR 1998, or do you only remember 'Taker throwing @RealMickFoley off the HIAC?  A:  He made The Rock tap out in the finals...  https://t.co/tUcpsglxLS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FiteTV That I remember?  https://t.co/m0776lxcPZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like both of these women, a lot, and I know ratings are antiquated and don't mean as much as they used to, but after #IMPACTonAXSTV  last night, this is the main event against #AEWDynamite ?  Oh, ok.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FiteTV @Goldberg @WWERomanReigns Absolutely.... not.  No thanks. Not now, Not ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FiteTV Another great show! They've been killing it the past year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BB_NinetyFive I can understand how it can distract though. I could do without the unison chants... just stick with cheers and boos<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BB_NinetyFive Ok. TO YOU it doesn't... You're the one that asked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BB_NinetyFive Yeah, just you.  It adds to the illusion that things are normal again... except for when they actually think a crowd would react to Nia and Lana for ANY reason whatsoever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realrhysallen @FiteTV @WWERoadDogg Nah, I want them to have a Twitter in 1998<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimmsGetzIt @WrestlingGary @IMPACTWRESTLING Yeah dude, they've been killing it since their AXS debut about a year ago. It's on my Tuesday night ist every week, for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kenny Omega about to start collecting titles like they're the Infinity Stones.  #BookIt #IMPACTonAXSTV  https://t.co/8ogUcuAFos<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeddiTurnbuckle A lot more than that when you think of Twitch, Sling, Cable, etc...(Who the fuck has cable?!) lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kenny about Josh: "I like him!"  Don: "Yeah, he's a stupid shit..."  #IMPACTonAXSTV 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man, I'm already happy with #IMPACTonAXSTV without Kenny. I hope ya'll realize that IMPACT is lit and this is just gonna get even better!  #AEWDynamite  https://t.co/zikx8QJoht<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tasty But where's the cheese?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chris Bey sold that right hook from Willie Mack like he was legit knocked the f**k out, man! #IMPACTonAXSTV  https://t.co/LMPzvSWEdQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sami Callihan.... He's right you know!  #TheDraw #IMPACTonAXSTV #ImpactWrestling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing against Swann, but c'mon... you just started a partnership/cross branding with AEW and they brought you Kenny Omega with the title.  You can do better than Rich Swann. #IMPACTonAXSTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Callihan with that shade.  Shut 'em down Champ! #TheDraw #IMPACTonAXSTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimmsGetzIt Cody Deaner and Cousin Jake. They've been pretty hype Deaner returned. Glad to see a singles push again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HAWT DAMN!   Meyers needed that win over TJP coming off that HAWT feud he just had with Hornswoggle... #sarcasm  #IMPACTonAXSTV #ImpactWrestling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Khan is such a nerd.  Bucks are overrated. #IMPACTonAXSTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimmsGetzIt The one and only Madison Rayne!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HAWT DAMN! I love me some of The North! #IMPACTonAXSTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FiteTV Definitely Road Dogg if not all four!  https://t.co/HN2P02HlId<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ya'll excited for #IMPACTonAXSTV just cause your boy Kenny is going to be there?  Well, buckle up. They've actually been on fire for at least the past year!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seaninNCarolina @TeddiTurnbuckle 100% been blocked by JBL 9 times on various accounts(Personal, work, side business etc..) over the past... well, how long has it been since he wrecked The Ascension?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FiteTV  https://t.co/mTiUpCFRna<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wrestlelamia He's got vegas odds of winning the Rumble. How long you gonna sleep on that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man, that was such good shit! Orton vs The Fiend is one of those feuds/matches that just makes it fun to be a fan. This is pro-wrestling!  #WWERaw #WWETLC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bliss is a little suspect with her absence. She's gonna get Randy right in the mommy daddy maker. Not to mention, Bray has been so underrated by Vince from day one. #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FiteTV Sasha Banks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know reports were saying that Reigns wasn't supposed to have a lengthy title...uh, reign... but he's killing it. I can't see them taking the title from him, at least not for KO at this point. #WWERaw #Smackdown #WWETLC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Riddle is just fun to watch. I'd be cool to see a little side quest of him and Hardy taking out MVP and Lashley. #WWERaw #BRONUTTS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Epsilonxero I can definitely see them doing Drew/Sheamus for 'Mania. It'll be the one that gets the CRAZY produced entrances like Taker and Triple H always get.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh man, Drew and Sheamus beat the hell out of each other, put Pat Buck through a table, then laugh with each other and walk off, probably for a beer... such fun shit! #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 1,000% didn't care about Shayna what-so-ever and she turned me during her title run in NXT. I wish they'd let her do on #WWERAW what she did in NXT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just here cause I love wrestling... life doesn't matter otherwise.  "You feel the only reason to not kill yourself... was so as not to hurt other people"   https://t.co/j66IzyvY8z  https://t.co/H5MB8E3C4R<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheQueenHeel REALLLLLLY wish I could laugh react this...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Polar_Fighter @RealBrittBaker Nah. I like pizza too much and I'm ok with that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stand up, filmmaker, video/content producer... divorced, alone, struggling... I couldn't word it better... Thank you @KevinBreel   #YouAreNotAlone    https://t.co/vJfq0EPxvy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealKeithLee @WWENetwork Been there... lost it all, wound up homeless... God bless you brother!!! Your story is an inspiration!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Basic, but as a fatty, I'm particular about pics of me... that beard is ON POINT tho!  https://t.co/PuP3VWZmSm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just remember... the holidays are hard for some people. Don't think it's all cheer. Reach out. See how your friends are. Stand behind them in their worst times.  They're not alone. #SuicideAwareness 800-273-8255<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After my divorce in 2015 and leaving film school, I was homeless for a few months, sleeping behind Big Lots where I was working.  @RealKeithLee, your 24, your story... made me shed a tear and gave me even more hope. #ThankYou<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pcwesner The irony of it is that their "proteges" are bigger, stronger, taller... Vince will push them on the main roster before he even calls up Gargano/Candace.... shame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hitRECordJoe mask? Wait, is this a question?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sparky347v I bought one once... 4 out of 10...did not enjoy it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kelly_Button Watched it before #WarGames.... so amazing!!!! 10 out of 10!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hot dang! @JohnnyGargano doesn't just have gold... HE IS GOLD!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OfficialEGO Nah, You're definitely Red Ranger... the leader, but no one cares. ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InnerN3rd If anyone's injured it's Adam Cole for taking Dunne's finisher over the back of a steel chair... Broken ribs on that menu this week!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmandaCaliber I'll take two... would totally cheer me up on gray days. haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13  https://t.co/hZMecMtBTr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I still think Big E's finisher should be called "The Lang Bang"  I mean, Keith Lee got away with Big Bang Catastrophe(BBC)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeyImageTV ah, I was kinda hybrid with Customer Service and sales when needed. So much BS with the "phone hub" for 5 stores problems... Overall still enjoyed it. Good company to be with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnnyGargano @austintheory1 Oh yeah!!!! #Johnny3times<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BCis4Life @WrestlingGuy435 FALSE  They're still better than The Ascension's time on RAW.🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BCis4Life @WrestlingGuy435 SAME  It's gonna happen though. It would be better than Retribution....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/ejcdT8Tq3s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWEEmberMoon Twisted Sisters...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BCis4Life @WrestlingGuy435 I honestly feel like they're being held back from any title picture while they wait for creative to call them up in the next couple of months... likely after Mania.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TopRopeNation You should focus on Community.... or Always Sunny in Philly... just sayin'. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ace_antagonist @pcwesner  https://t.co/8wyyTLNTLf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SAME<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWEGareth 2.75, I'm sure... 🤡🤡🤡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ace_antagonist @pcwesner Bizarro Miz!  https://t.co/KnESYrHJbC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealBrittBaker Shut up. Go pull some teeth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pcwesner @AdamColePro @KORcombat @roderickstrong @theBobbyFish Funny to note: Everyone said it made no sense that Shotzi won the ladder match to get the advantage.... BUT, every team who had the advantage has lost #WarGames<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scarpetti94hjy @WWENetwork  https://t.co/HxX5tktO1F<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just gonna say it: @PatMcAfeeShow has become one of my favorite people that ever lived! #WarGames #NXTTakeOver #ForTheBrand<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You're right, I'm already going back and rewatching that #WarGames match. @WWENetwork #NXTTakeOver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimmsGetzIt If anyone would take the McAfee money and turn heel, I'd go with Roddy, for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. One. Caught. Him.  Mad respect for Pat McAfee swantoning from the top of the #WarGames cage. #NXTTakeOver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeyImageTV Yeah, "fun"  Nothing like getting yelled at cause no one wants a credit card! lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pcwesner Must have been the guac....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>UNDISPUTED! #NXTTakeOver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adamgoldberg28 @kat_woman13 He's a brand now... he has people doing all of that for him and for the brand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheHootsPodcast Most fans don't know what a soliloquy is...🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeyImageTV I worked at a Best Buy in '17/'18... I got it!  LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listen, Roderick Strong is super underrated and they messed up not having him beat Roode for the NXT title... but can we talk about how he looks like generic create a wrestler number 5?  #NXTTakeover #Wargames<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeyImageTV 🤣🤣🤣🤣  Pretty sure it's the same douche....idk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TopRopeNation  https://t.co/Wh3XPf38J3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That mother fkr pulled out a cricket bat.... 🤣🤣🤣 #WarGames #NXTTakeover  https://t.co/aoAhVLmB71<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know @PatMcAfeeShow  is gonna pull something... but I also think he's gonna get in that cage and WRECK someone! #WarGames #NXTTakeOver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 Roddy has always kinda felt like the odd man out in my mind...  https://t.co/Xwz8WLIiqU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TopRopeNation Don't steal my ideas!!! lol jkjk  I totally agree he'll be last and there's gonna be some shenanigans... but after him vs Cole, he might just straight up run in there and fuck someone up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gabynum1919 Man, I still 100% believe the Ciampa/Gargano feud would have KILLED on Smackdown.  Johnny gets called up and Ciampa stalks him and follows him to Smackdown? TAKE MY MONEY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 100% cringe-worthy. I have to look away sometimes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gabynum1919 Sad things is: I don't want him to go main roster after 75% of the NXT guys get buried by Vince's boys...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pete Dunne spent the entire quarantine at the gym, not eating a single carb...Damn. He's gonna wreck everyone! #WarGames<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pcwesner Man, it was the BEST option they could give us... We all know McAfee will be last and offer up some kind of shenanigans to lock the last UE guy in the cage(Cole likely)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gabynum1919 I hope not. But I can see him being what Corbin was supposed to be before his Twitter antics and losing MITB.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dunne and Kyle start?!? OH HELL YES!!!!! #NXTTakeover #WarGames<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TopRopeNation Coming from Central PA... I hate camo after 37 years. I'll stick with their black shirts. (Though these ones do look good...)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm geeking out like I'm 10 again!  Thank you @TripleH !!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Priest is legit a future WWE Champion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IT'S TIME!!!! #NXTTakeOver #WarGames @RealKingRegal is the best! @PatMcAfeeShow is gonna blow your minds.  @PeteDunneYxB is going to wreck everyone! Thank you, NXT!  https://t.co/VK3DbnMRjl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you don't get the "IT WAS ME, AUSTIN" line, then you're too young for me fam.... BYE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG!!!! "It's me, Austin! IT WAS ME ALL ALONG!"  That just made the whole thing EPIC... Austin Theory unmasked as Ghostface and is with Gargano now. #NXTTakeover #WarGames<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 It's water. When you throw water on them they multiply. Feeding them after midnight turns them into Gremlins... I think... wait...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Freaking #Retribution showing up at #NXTTakeOver with Ghostface masks... Ok then. #WarGames #JohnnyWrestling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimmsGetzIt Depending on who does it, sometimes it looks like hit hurts even more when it connects... ala RVD lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching Priest for the Flatliner and I keep thinking "If NXT was around 20 years ago, Kanyon would have stolen the show every single week! #NXTTakeOver #Wargames<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't care what anyone says.... Sliced Bread is a great freaking move!  #NXTTakeover #WarGames<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh they going for that big fight MSG feel... I dig it!  Gargano... first ever THREE TIME Champion in NXT. #NXTTakeOver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I kinda feel bad for Finn... but I can't wait to see Kross completely WRECK HIM to get that title back. #NXTTakeOver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>KROSS IS BACK!  KROSS IS BACK!  THIS IS NOT A DRILL!!!!! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 #NXTTakeOver #TickTock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProWFinesse 100% gonna watch it... Kane had TWO, why not Lumis?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hot dang! Grimes took a face full of that chair when he went down! #NXTTakeOver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RawIsGibby I love both these guys, but I'm starting to agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimmsGetzIt Tis the shitheads in the front row who figured out they can bang the plexi on the fencing... I'd love to smack em all in the dick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yup! I love Lumis, but @CGrimesWWE  is one of the best things NXT has going!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TezangiVictoria He can put them around my throat. I'll call him daddy. Make it a whole show.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TezangiVictoria Now THAT.... is Undisputed!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lumis looks like he's about to kidnap Arnold Schwarzenegger's daughter and hold her ransom... #WarGames #NXTTakeOver #StrapMatch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh snap... It's Zombie Ref. Poor Cameron. #WarGames #NXTTakeOver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ya'll talk about Thatcher when Cameron Grimes is the most must see, talked about man on the NXT roster! #WarGames #NXTTakeover #StrapMatch   TO THE MOOOOON!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProWFinesse The best tho?  Nah fam.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProWFinesse  https://t.co/7tGvZpp655<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does Thatcher always look like a human version of Scar? #WarGames #NXTTakeover  https://t.co/NUZCxpQYeV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really wanna wreck that kid that started banging the plexi against the fencing in the front row... #WarGames #NXTTakeover<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThatGuyStroup @pcwesner Oh yeah, Kross is gonna wreck him here shortly. No one else other than Ciampa can be in the title scene right now.... not just yet, anyways.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love and a Baby Ruth... what could be better?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TezangiVictoria Just can't get into Thatcher for some reason...  https://t.co/g9TTZRnV21<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TopRopeNation At best, he's boring old Leonardo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know this will be a really good match, but I just can't get into Thatcher... I dunno what it is. #WarGames #NXTTakeover<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man, Pete Dunne gives ZERO fks about Pat McAfee's antics. 🤣🤣🤣 #WarGames #NXTTakeOver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does Finn Balor show up tonight after the way McAfee and Co interrupted him last week?! #WarGames<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TripleZ_87 Floyd vs who?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaitlynJK LOVE IT!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#WarGames #WWENXT  Dakota with that double stomp off the top rope.  Finn Balor:  https://t.co/FF5oOtbh19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Irony: 6 minutes later she was STUCK in that trash can and they couldn't get it off of her to make a pin...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pcwesner She must be a huge Oscar The Grouch fan...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Io... first person EVER to jump off the top of a cage while wearing a trash can...  You can't make this up! #WarGames #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, like Io isn't going to scale that cage and moonsault off of it... #WarGames #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tan_TheMan95 @pcwesner Drunk?!  Pfff... we'd all be DEAD!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TopRopeNation Did somebody say..... "GET THE TABLES"?! #WarGames<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ToruYanoFanAcct @PacmanCarterIII Yeah, she's overrated so... meh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think we all knew #NXTTakeOver would kill it tonight, but this match, less than 25mins in, is AMAZING!   These women can go! #WarGames<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh man.... Ember Moon is so sexy that it hurts my heart... then again, so is Tyler Bate... #WarGames #NXTTakeOver   This match is amazing so far!!!! I love you @ShotziWWE !!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pcwesner @PatMcAfeeShow @PeteDunneYxB "Undefeated in 2020" doesn't mean anything in 2020 when a lot of guys have had all of 5 matches. #WarGames<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dan_vetrano Resorts or Landscaping?  asking for a friend....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had a dream last night that my girl asked me to lose weight...  I like pizza more than you. No.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheRealDisco @Konnan5150 Yeah.... great...  https://t.co/0Up7NpVj4t<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FiteTV I fell asleep just over an hour into NXT. What I caught from AEW was bangin'... Impact was enjoyable, but as usual, not stand out. NXT UK was fun... RAW was one of the better ones and Smackdown had me all in towards the end.  I'll go AEW this week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@view_raw yeah, but being a non-main, it hit harder coming from Jeffery. 100<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LOL Ok, maybe this one is the best botch ever!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@akfytwrestling Sting. 100%  WWE had Taker, Austin, Rock, Foley, DX... WCW had DDP, a frail "we're tired of this" NWO, and Sting saving it all.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mavericksmovies Se7en was the reason as a teen I wanted to get into filmmaking. One of the best movies ever made and grossly underrated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lythas5 Oh 100%..but I'm willing to bet without Star Wars, the 80s wouldn't have happened where they made some of our favorite cartoons JUST to sell the action figures the toy company already made. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TSM3K_Chris @OSWreview Man, I'm shocked Vince hasn't tried a "Law &amp; Order" gimmick the past two years, but Bossman would have killed it with the IC Title in the late 90s.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lythas5 God bless the guy for actually being able to talk the original company into giving him merch royalties... I don't think he made any real money from the movie itself, could be wrong though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TSM3K_Chris @OSWreview Much like Bossman... their heel pushes were so good and completely underrated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OSWreview Man, I always forget Bulldog's solo face run with the long hair... dude was so great when he turned(on Diesel, I think) and cut all his hair off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#AskToni hmmm..  Any plans to go show the #NXTUK woman's division why you're the best one in that locker room or are you just #WWENXT for now?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really hope Blake calls out Murphy one week like "Dude, we were BAM. Us and Alexa was the best thing in NXT at one point, then you said "screw it" after you got the phone call and you left me to die."    or something like that. lol #SmackDown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really want to wreck the person who decided to add "Hey Google" in the commercial on Sling or Hulu. Tired of my mini being activated.... douchers @Sling @Google<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How are they booking Murphy and the Mysterio as heels while feuding a #SmackDown top heel?  Makes ZERO SENSE. We'll see<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TopRopeNation Sadly, big daddy Vince likes to act like NXT doesn't exist when these guys come up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TopRopeNation Especially with Blake's NXT history with Murphy(and Alexis) B.A.M. #SmackDown #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eian_terrell @TeddiTurnbuckle Sasha looks like a bad trans.. no offense to trans.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChiefJosheola @TripleZ_87 Nah, someone(I'm looking at you Hulu) will pay a studio BIG BUCKS to steal them from a deal with HBO Max... That's all this is. Everyone wanting to get their piece while us poor bastards are paying even more than we did with cable.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Great stuff! Lee/Drew would have been great, but let's be honest... Drew vs AJ will be PHENOMENAL!  #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBlueRiott Well, he did win NXT Title in his TAKEOVER In-ring debut. #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE @CedricAlexander @AustinCreedWins I'm glad he's there to show us what the "hurt" in "Hurt Business" stands for.   #BlankStare #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm with Woods... I also thought the "Hurt" in "Hurt Business" stood for HURT... I dunno. Maybe we're crazy.  Cedric sounded a lil better than Slaphappy and Retribution though.  #WWERaw #HurtBusiness<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ZakFellows @WrestleFeatures That's possible. Watch them be this amazing heel stable and BAM! Seth comes back as a face and takes Rey's other eye.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrestleFeatures It's weird AF. They come out and act like full-blown heels while Murphy faces Smackdown's biggest heel... King Corbin.  It made zero sense that they were so into helping Murphy screw Corbin while the Thunderdome guy kept telling us to cheer them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never forget, Ken Shamrock won KOTR in '98. The night everyone only remembers for Foley/Taker in Hell in a Cell.   I still say Billy Gunn was the worst booked KOTR though.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If you're not hyped for KO vs Reigns, then you've probably been throwing shade at this Reigns story since day one(ish). Nothing against Drew/Fiend/RAW... but THIS is the story to be in on. Best Angle since Reigns/Sheild debuted.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BrokenSpacehog @LanceStorm ROH was amazing. I knew of Desmond Wolfe in TNA and enjoyed his work, then I got to really watch Nigel McGuiness in ROH and my jaw dropped with almost every match. I love the internet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrokenSpacehog @LanceStorm And Punk... clearly. But even listening to Heyman on podcasts and what not, that was an uphill battle he almost lost completely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrokenSpacehog @LanceStorm You know, honestly looking back at the roster, if they let Paul run the roost, and it WASN'T PG... it would have made more stars than just Sheamus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 You fine, but that NXT mask tho...  https://t.co/KXq68K3lWQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrokenSpacehog @LanceStorm Like, it's 2020 and I still want to punch people who say "ECW" and start talking about the "WWECW" failed experiment of 2008.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SPBITW9 That was such a nice, subtle addition to the whole thing! I love it!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dang. Don't judge me on my typos tonight. Trying to be quick and NOT get kicked out of Thunderdome cause I don't have cable and want to watch #SmackDown  LOL  #DontYouJudgeMe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yo, that was 100% the strangest match to watch. Murphy is a face, but still feels heel, while the Mysterio family went straight up heel to stop Corbin from winning... 202 is weird man. #SmackDown #ThunderDome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What just happened? That was everything a heel group would do. I'm tired of booing King Corbin. #ShutUpThunderdomeGuy  #SmackDown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is the Mysterio Family acting like heels. Distraccting Corbin to help Murphy?  That's super heel-like.  Weird. #SmackDown #ImOnThunderdome!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReneePaquette Is that something you found on pornhub?  What?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZakFellows Nah, not common at all. Even outside of wrestling, that's writing 101. The "face" has to overcome the odds to win... been that way since Shakespeare!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now THAT is how you put on a show! Every week, #WWENXT just pushes it a little harder. What a ladder match!!  #WarGames<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG... These two might kill each other tonight. This is awesome! #WWENXT   Side note: That one ref will forever be referred to as "Zombie Ref" from now on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 I can 100% abso-FREAKING-lutely see that happening! lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 Nah. two heel teams right now. They returned and my first thought was "who do Lorcan &amp; Burch drop the tag titles to so GYV can get them?" lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is going to be a great match. Story-wise, zero point. The heel team always gets the advantage because the face team always has to overcome the odds against them. That's storytelling 101  #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok ok, Shotzi will have Ember, Io, and Ripley...   Can we get to KOR vs Pete Dunne now?!?!   #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Leather strap match.... ON THE MOOOOON!   #WarGames is going to be balls to the wall AMAZING! #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DANG! Let's go #StraighttotheMoon! Cause @CGrimesWWE  can do wrong to NO MAN! #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's funny. When I look through the twitter feed during commercials, people watching #AEWDynamite are complaining and people watching #WWENXT are hoot'n and holler'n.  Interesting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HAHAHA  Teddy Regal makes a triple threat match for the NA Title at #WarGames!  #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AJAT800 @kat_woman13 After watching another Ripley/Io vignette, you might be right... With two wargames matches, I didn't think they'd worry about the Woman's title and get them both on a team. I can dig it tho!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not big on Thatcher, but I'm looking forward to Ciampa getting his hands on him!  #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AJAT800 @kat_woman13 Because she's legit had 3 matches on TV. Io will join and start a massive feud with Toni Storm for the title.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 2Good 2Bad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YAAAAASS! Thank you Johnny!  #MerryPowerCoupleChristmas #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My money is on Io joining Shotzi, Ember, and Ripley. You gotta start that Io/Storm feud! #WWENXT #WarGames<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't say I'm shocked that Indi isn't being put in WarGames. She's literally had 3 matches on #WWENXT TV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well now, that was unexpected.  What's your malfunction, Toni Storm?  #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AJAT800 @kat_woman13 Yeah, Team Candace was very obvious... I suspect you're right about Team Shotzi too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dakota, Gonzalez, and Hartwell all join Candace.. #Shocker   #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 I love Grimes, UE, The Brand... but I'll be honest, I want that WarGames woman's match to build. Gimme those teams!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just thinking that #WWENXT should be a banger tonight! Can't wait to see Shotzi and Candace build their #WarGames teams!  I hope #TheBrand shows up. Love some @PatMcAfeeShow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWECesaro All of the above, TBH.  #GiveCesaroAChance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just when you thought you were going to get to go back to in-person work in the newsroom, they pull everyone back out.  It's only been 8 months so far... #remotework #COVID  @Kelseyjorogers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel it's irresponsible for parents to complain about virtual learning because they treat the school as a daycare. #AASD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill @kenjeong I guess better late than never?   Just shows you that they knew all along and were more worried about trying to rally their cult for votes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Epiloguers  https://t.co/9OUXtTXQcB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DeVos is going to get the boot and still wander around her mansion thinking she knows how the education system works after 4 years... and I think that pretty much sums up the entire Trump administration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChampionOfDads I'll be at work, but at least they're feeding us! #gobblegobble<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Y2JamesRyder @the_fashionball That hurts my heart, wrinkles my brain, and irks my very soul.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sick and tired of waking up feeling sick and tired. Can't we just have a normal life again? #Blah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kelseyjorogers @AlexFlumTV  https://t.co/OUFvGRxtCV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBlueRiott His whole cult is just clueless to the real world. No way I could do another 4 years of that orange dildo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone else find it strange that one of the better episodes of #WWERAW since COVID wrecked the country was an episode with no Champion(Drew), no MizNMorrison(MITB), and no Retribution?  https://t.co/dVKLLF6i59<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Epsilonxero Right. I was a little late to the party, but I don't think Miz was on the show either.  Strange. Probably one of the better RAWs since COVID hit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPBITW9 I'm not looking to die from alcohol poisoning!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I gotta say, #WWERaw was pretty good.  Speaks volumes that there was no Retribution tonight. Hmmm  https://t.co/Sqsm2o3LTg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDreZone Finger poke of doom.... incoming.  Cross joins Bliss/Fiend, this was all a set-up. #WWERaw #PleaseGodNo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do I feel like it's the '80s again with @NikkiCrossWWE new theme?  I dig it! #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not a bad way to advance Keith Lee and keep Lashley looking really strong as the US Champion. I'll allow it! #WWERaw  I hope we get Riddle vs Lee vs Styles next week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yup. His legs gave out from under him.... #DAMN #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimmsGetzIt He definitely buckled under the weight. That could have been REAL bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yooo... that could have been REAL bad when Lashley's legs buckled under the weight of Keith Lee. What a proper time for a commercial break. #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ViVaFoxyFoxxy See? You got it!!!! lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ViVaFoxyFoxxy Keep rockin' socks girl!  Tomorrow: It's a new day, yes it is!!!(some WWE pun intended)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>MVP: "I'm not your bro..."  Riddle: "Awww"    🤣🤣🤣#WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow... that submission... Rusev is a very lucky man. #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Non-title?  Oh yeah, Lana/Asuka definitely win. Tag title match at TLC. #WWERaw   If not for Shayna and Asuka, I wouldn't care... at all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yup. Lana/Asuka - New Woman's Tag Team Champions by the end of the year(if not tonight) #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pcwesner  https://t.co/xqSCx3qqJ8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's the greatest match of all time and why are you going to try and tell me it's Hogan/Andre at #WrestleMania III?  #WWERAW #Smackdown #SurvivorSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deviousjourney Touche.  Again, not saying I agree with this universal "decision" that it was the best... just my thoughts on why. But I guess when you dominate the world, you can make people believe whatever you feed them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWwecommentator Yeah, 100%  The past few weeks really looked like a set-up for Sheamus/Drew. Ireland vs Scotland. Braveheart vs... The Leprechaun. Probably for the best though so Hornswoggle didn't show up again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deviousjourney Because that was the draw, along with Macho/Steamboat... fast forward to "at least 3 shows" and they're just about the Mania experience, selling out no matter what the matches were... that wasn't a thing in the '80s. Not that I agree with Hogan/Andre<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWwecommentator Same. scrolling through Twitter it doesn't look like we missed a lot other than 3 singles matches, those winners have a triple threat next week, winner faces Drew at TLC(I assume at TLC)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Riddle with the win, after all that Irish/Scottish stuff they did with Sheamus and Drew?  Ok. #WWERaw  https://t.co/JkaF4WQsrp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel like this match was booked to be long so Sheamus looks strong to go after Drew at #WWETLC  Great match with Riddle though on #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Drew vs any 6 of them would be great at TLC, but give us bastard Sheamus, the one who use to wreck Triple H with a lead pipe, vs Drew in a TLC match. #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aidan_odizzy @TBARRetribution @WWE @undertaker  https://t.co/XFXuzI6L7e<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rhall1985 @TBARRetribution @WWE @undertaker Cool. But they haven't done anything to back up their mouths... K Thanx Bye<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TBARRetribution @WWE @undertaker Bro, you weren't even on the PPV...  Fix that before you keep running your mouth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Her: "so tell me about your childhood."  Me: #ThankYouTaker  https://t.co/vbXRLe4qEd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can you imagine growing up and finally understanding that "Holy shit. That's my father?!"  Wow  #ThankYouTaker #FarewellTaker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never had much money, enjoying a simple life, so I went to more indy shows than WWE shows... but I'm so happy I got to see a live Taker entrance as the deadman in Philly about 8 years ago. #ThankYouTaker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDreZone And then he kept evolving it to fit the evolution of 'Taker, with the exception of American Badass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SAME!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrestlegedonPod Screw it. Give me COVID, kill me. Just let me be live for this. #ThankYouTaker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmandaCaliber @AndyNemmity Covid mandates are a bitch. They should have been used though, for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who the hell is cutting onions?! 😢😢😢  #ThankYouTaker #FarewellTaker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow... they cleared the ring real quick for Vince. #ThankYouTaker #FarewellTaker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gabynum1919 I was thinking the exact same thing when he came out mask and all. 🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All these legends.... The Fiend is getting his hands on someone...    #ThankYouTaker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hold old does he need to be before he gets his Sexy MAN card? He's been the Sexy Boy longer than I've been alive!   #ThankYouTaker #THeFeels<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is amazing. That's all I can say.  #ThankYouTaker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kevin Nash shows up and you know it's just #TOOSWEET!  #ThankYouTaker #MyChildhood #Rightinthefeels<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck you, Savio Vega. I remember Bruiser Brody's episode of Dark Side of the Ring. #survivorseries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HOLY SHIT! It's Naked Mideon!!  This is so great!! #ThankYouTaker #SurvivorSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will ALWAYS geek out when I hear that car screech and crash when @RealMickFoley comes out. He's my #GOAT   #SurvivorSeries #ThankYouTaker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yoooo!  Let them fight forever!  Now THAT was a main event! Reigns proves he's the head of the table! #survivorseries   #WWERaw -4 #SmackDown -3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Matmenpodcast Calm the fuck down! Cargo pants are the shiznit! 🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How long have I been watching wrestling?  Well, let me tell you something brother... when I was born, and the Dr. smacked my ass, I looked at him and asked "What'chu gonna do?!" #SurvivorSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watch wrestling. Escape reality. Pretend "adulting" isn't real. Worked for me these past 35 years...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now THIS is gonna be a barn burner! Lots of people talking about Miz possibly cashing in tonight on Drew... #SurvivorSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FollowTheCreed2 A local guy I'm tight friends with would always complain that he'd ask people what they thought of his match and they'd just say "Yeah man, great stuff" when he actually wanted feedback so he could improve... Nia def just gets the "good stuff" from everyone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lana?  I feel like Vince has just been punking us for the past 2 months. #SurvivorSeries #WeveBeenPunked<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FollowTheCreed2 By never learning how to sell.  She's legit one of those people that instead of being told the truth, everyone is just like "Oh yeah. Good job..."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the dumbest thing ever. I'm sorry I got invested in this match. #LANAWINSLOL  #SurvivorSeries   #WWERaw -4 #Smackdown -2  Because Math is a thing, RAW takes the overall win tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a crap way to eliminate Baszler. #SurvivorSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know how Belair does some of the things she does without tripping/slipping on that braid.  She's legit the EST! #SurvivorSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You wanna make Belair a star tonight, a real threat to the division? She needs to pin Baszler and/or Jax. #SurvivorSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lacey Evans with those boots... I know they say "Sassy" but all you really see is "ass"   That top rope Spanish fly tho!!!  #SurvivorSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fucking Natalya.... #Botched<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Graves: "It's already practically 5 versus 4"  Tom: "You're the worst...."  🤣🤣🤣I'm dead. #SurvivorSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheHootsPodcast Can't be hurt when you're busy hurting everyone else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brianhwaters She's not bad, but for some reason, I was just never able to get into her and I can't explain why. lol Never cared for her in NXT either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who's the best woman on the roster right now and why is it @itsBayleyWWE ? #SurvivorSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mandatory "I love Bayley and everything about her" tweet as she comes out for Team #SmackDown at #SurvivorSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimmsGetzIt Shall we start a petition to try and make it happen? You know what? Let's just get a pizza and when she's distracted by it, we push her into the Gulf of Mexico and just go from there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let me tell you how Vince works.  Miz was given MITB right as the new season of Miz &amp; Mrs. was about to drop.  Lana's "Chronicle" is about to debut on the Network... I wonder who's going to come out looking good tonight? #SurvivorSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"What is he, Wile E. Coyote?"  "NO! HE'S A BIRD, TOM!"  Sometimes commentary kills me in a good way. #SurvivorSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When was the last time Asuka actually got pinned?  Sasha for the win at #SurvivorSeries   #WWERaw -3 #SmackDown -2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeyImageTV Pretty sure it's actually Drew Gulak.... but yeah, Gooker is the champion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wrestlelamia Welp, One's the best and good against almost anyone. The other is Sasha.... *shrugs*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gabynum1919 I look at it like that Lumis/Grimes blindfold match.. it is what it is, but one of the people made it entertaining every chance he could(Zayn/Grimes)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeyImageTV If I told you the Gobbledy Gooker won the 24/7 Championship, you'd probably stop watching for another 6 months. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimmsGetzIt It is possible. I'm just always so bored by Jax, Lana, and Natalya to the point I can barely keep the channel on when they're doing anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed. I know Shelton had an injury and his "resigning" got pushed back, then they didn't do much with him. This angle has been great, minus some of the Retribution stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimmsGetzIt Sadly, I feel like the woman's #SurvivorSeries elimination match is going to be the break for me. Just such little interest, in my opinion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not even gonna bring up Sasha being overrated in my book(c wut I did there?).. I'm just gonna say: " I didn't get Asuka in NXT and over the years, she's become one of my all-time favorites!"  #SurvivorSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPBITW9 I'm waiting for Al Snow to randomly show up with "head" some week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. Another RAW win after Zayn taps out. #SurvivorSeries   #WWERaw -3 (again, if you count the kickoff battle royal) #SmackDown -1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FACTS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was at Full Sail and watched @SamiZayn vs @FightOwensFight at Takeover in 2015 and honestly, that was the only good thing that happened that entire year in my life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LanceStorm @ChrisHero He pulls off that Two and a Half Men/Charlie Sheen look though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm a huge fan of Zayn, and especially THIS version, but I think Lashley is going to wreck him. If Zayn wins, it's gonna be shady... like with help from Retribution. #SurvivorSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OOOF that Doomsday Blockbuster and a Street Profits win! #DAMN #SurvivorSeries   #WWERaw -2 #SmackDown -1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MontezFordWWE with the best frogsplash since Eddie and RVD! These guys are STRAIGHT FIRE! #SurvivorSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know if they'll name this and add it as a signature to his move-set, but it looked good! #SurvivorSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWwecommentator @PacmanCarterIII Ford and Belair could be the real-EST, great-EST, strong-EST power couple in the WWE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This isn't the same New Day. They're intentionally wrestling like heels... what if they snap, Big E tries to stop them and then just joins them to wreck the profits?   All 3 go heel on different brands. #SurvivorSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 I was so happy that they went to Smackdown while Garza stayed on RAW.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love the Street Profits, but I would 100% bet money on Vince seeing a solo star in Ford. Dawkins struggled for multiple years trying to stand-out in NXT. #SurvivorSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChampionOfDads  https://t.co/jKLwluJJ6A<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This match might actually steal the show! New Day vs Street Profits up next!!  #SurvivorSeries #RAWvsSmackdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Team RAW(mens) wins at #SurvivorSeries   #WWERaw -2 (if you count the kickoff Battle Royal) #SmackDown -0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like Otis, but he's legit the store brand version of Hacksaw Jim Duggan. #SurvivorSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Otis, Keith Lee, Braun... I'm shocked we haven't heard 100 times about them "reinforcing the ring" tonight. #SurvivorSeries #GetWithItCommentary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SJPWRESTLINGPOD Apparently, he REALLY hates Matt Riddle IRL and refuses to work with him.   Now he doesn't have to. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*Riddle exists*  Rollins: "ELIMINATE ME"  #SurvivorSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Triple H's top two boys facing on in #SurvivorSeries !!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People like to crap on Corbin, but his evolution has been fascinating over the past 4-5 years. He's always solid in the ring and on the mic. #SurvivorSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ooohhhh... I think I'm diggin' the new Keith Lee tracks he laid down. #NewMusic #SurvivorSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BROOOOOO...  if dirtsheets are right, I suspect Riddle is either first out, or they never let him in the ring with Seth. #SurvivorSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Such a shit heel move!  Love the Miz!!!!  That's one for RAW. #SurvivorSeries   #WWERaw -1 #Smackdown- 0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thdeadlysin Nah, Gable is Smackdown, isn't he?!  I don't even know anymore. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love the Miz. He's such a great shitbag of a heel. And Miz &amp; Mrs. is always fun to watch...  Cannonball sucks though. 100% not a fan.  #SurvivorSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone talking about Miz cashing in... I can see it, for sure. I kinda feel like he was given the case to carry it into 2021 when fans are allowed back though. Guess we'll see.  Miz cash in, wins, loses title to Fiend? #BookIt #SurvivorSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which Elias should win, but it'll be Dominick. #SurvivorSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gabynum1919 I feel you.  "Ok, so by the time the kickoff match STARTS, I can put the pizza in, then we'll be able to eat as the first #SurvivorSeries match starts."  lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LOL  Vince: "Murphy, you can have an entrance, but it's going to be to Rey's music... with Rey. Literally, just go walk out with Rey..." #SurvivorSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>GOBBLEDY GOOKER IS NEW 24/7 CHAMPION!!!  #SurvivorSeries #HolyShite<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love wrestling so much that I make myself suffer watching/listening to JBL, Booker, and Lawler on the kickoff just so I can watch the kickoff match. #DedicatedAF #SurvivorSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They did Natalya vs Tamina? I bet that was a real barn burner on #Smackdown. LOL #SurvivorSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ranal55 @PacmanCarterIII I'm just pretending to be prepared.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, I know, I don't like Sasha... but I'm telling you that Asuka is going to keep being made to look stronger and stronger until Charlotte comes back and takes that title. It's one of the few matches RAW will win tonight. #SurvivorSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thdeadlysin Yes!  Thank God.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can't have Jerry Lawler on the #SurvivorSeries kickoff panel and NOT mention this iconic Survivor Series team he was the leader of.  https://t.co/O0Hu5jxYbh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ya'll ready for #SurvivorSeries?! Always one of my favorite shows of the year, always has been(as long as they have elimination matches)  #ThankYouTaker #TeamSmackDown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chelsea_weiand Probably an 8. Profits/New Day, Drew/Reigns, Men's #SurvivorSeries  match, The Fiend. And: #ThankYouTaker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 That is also a very good point. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 That's a very good point! I believe you have won this argument! lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 SAME! I love some Fin!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man, '06-'09, 'Taker was on a level no one could touch. But I think the Ministry will always be my favorite version of the Deadman.  #ThankYouTaker  #SurvivorSeries   https://t.co/gp6omewJ2e<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@podcast_uf Head of the table?  or #TableHead? Not gonna be as good as Head Cheese though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@P1AllElite You must have hit your head when you fell off that elite high horse you have there. 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Matmenpodcast Smackdown takes the big W overall. USA won last year, Fox wins this year. Really looking forward to the mens match and Drew/Reigns. Zayn gonna pull out a slick win, probably after RETRIBUTION interferes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those days you just feel empty inside... at least there's a PPV tonight though. Wrestling: helping you escape reality for decades.   https://t.co/8CTbn2pTKp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welp, at least #SurvivorSeries is on tonight! Predictions?!  I'm thinking #SmackDown takes the overall win against #WWERaw . #WWENXT  won last year, but that's still the USA Network. This one's for FOX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One more tweet and it's night night forever, right @BQQuinn?  #jokers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yo... I think he just shit his pants<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm 97% sure that after @AdamColePro kicked @PatMcAfeeShow in the face.... DEAD!   #wwenxt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't get why people go crazy for Thatcher... but then again, those people probably don't get why I love AG since the indies as Retro AG (Anthony Greene).  #wwenxt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrestlingGifFri  https://t.co/36NyTZ0prz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm gonna lose my mind if Kross interrupts Finn and just absolutely wrecks him... then just walks out with his title that he never got beat for. #wwenxt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How you gonna promote Arturo as "destruction" then feed him to Kushida in 3 minutes?   Just an odd play... #wwenxt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Dude, if you don't like how our democracy works, you can move to Canada!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChandranTheMan those 18 months he was actually around over those 10 years*  Fixed it for you brah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's the fascination with JOINT Facebook accounts and why are they mostly all Trump Supporters?  What are you hiding over there JimNDottie Maga?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChandranTheMan He was doing big things in 2000? Like what? Like dropping the title, leaving for Hollywood, showing up in 2001, cutting a bullshit "Get the F out" promo, took the title for 35 days, then left again until 2004ish? (then came back for 4 months) Ok<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChandranTheMan Oh ok  https://t.co/00bT51mw3x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChandranTheMan A whopping 210 days, 3 of them were for 35 days just between PPVs while he wasn't busy in Hollywood and Vince could make a quick buck.  Like when he came back and beat Punk so Vince could make a quick buck?  Yeah.  The Rock sucks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChandranTheMan Oh, so like, 12 days?  Cool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hilarious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dropthehat @ThatEricAlper Welp, you're definitely not on the Mount Rushmore of math...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChandranTheMan What? The Rock have it for like 10 days before tucking his tail and going to Hollywood?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SashaBanksWWE is overrated.  ⓘ Official sources stated that this is a scientific fact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Drew vs Reigns should be great.   But the family is going to WRECK Drew after the match, Miz takes the title. Drops it to Orton or Wyatt at TLC. #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good Guy Sheamus... wait, is he a face? I dunno. #WWERaw  https://t.co/UIzNnORLPI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPBITW9 I can also see Miz trying to cash in tonight, making it a triple threat, and Drew actually pins Miz to win the title.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPBITW9 Yeah, I 100% believe Miz is going to be the catalyst/transition to switch the title back without another Drew/Orton feud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let me tell you right now...  If they swerve us all and we get Miz vs Reigns at #SurvivorSeries, I'm not watching. #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPBITW9 Nah, I'm going with Drew after the way they hyped it up on Smackdown.   I think they want to get Orton to 16 titles too. So lose tonight, et it back at the Rumble, No. 15.  #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RingFalconBrand  https://t.co/kUUfhHLBGt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did I miss Lana going through the announce table? Damn.  Oh well, probably looked just like the last 7. #yawn #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 Agreed. Though it feels like Asuka is just being tossed around the roster until Charlotte Flair comes back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 That's probably the only match #WWERaw will actually win. #SmackDown gets the bragging rights this year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Downside,  Orton loses tonight on #WWERaw  Plus side, we get Reigns vs Drew.  Also plus side, Orton gets his 15th title at the Rumble(if not sooner)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You're only at stage 1? Damn fam, this gonna be a LOOOONG winter.  https://t.co/RLhGIW4AhI<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump "just getting ready to do...."  Based on those taxes you said you'd revel, I feel like you're not showing anything for another 6 years. "Just getting ready"  LOL  assclown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unlike @realDonaldTrump... I would actually still love Dan Harmon(And Community) if he shot someone in the middle of 5th Avenue.  Break that wall. #Meta #4thWall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CurtAmbrose @TheBlueRiott @xleahxz No, Nyla... oh... the person on the far right... Yeah, no idea who that is. I'll have to look up Chaos in NJPW... sorry, I've been so interested in Impact the past year that I've missed a lot of NJPW and ROH.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UTTRob Roman Reigns.  Best right now? Far from it... but everyone(EVERYONE) is talking about him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yo, I might be old, but if she don't know who Katie Vick is, she's too young for you bro!  @WWE #WWERaw #RAWDAWGANDBAIL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBlueRiott @xleahxz wait, who is that on the far right?  Disclaimer: I always have to apologize for trying to hit on Nyla Rose when she came to the local indy show I worked with. She's amazing tho, in and out of the ring.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lythas5 HAHAHA Oh that Tori!!! What an angle though. That's when Kane learned how to talk!!! (Enter Katie Vick....)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lythas5 True.   I measure it on the undercard. Yeah there was Austin, The Rock, Taker, Foley, DX... but look at Goldust, the Headbangers, APA just before they were the APA, the Ministry. Just like 2000 WCW, I look back at some of the AE and go "how did we watch this shit?"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unpopular opinion: Just because the Attitude Era had Austin and The Rock doesn't mean anything.  Ruthless Aggression was the best era in terms of talent, wrestling, entertaining, etc...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brianhwaters Knock on Vizio, but they compare to Samsung with almost half the cost because Samsung banks on their name....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brianhwaters After 2016-2018 at Best Buy, there's not a ton of difference, but LG is absolutely leading the way. So is Vizio, tbh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IdiotB9720 @WrestleCritic Speaking of reality shows because of their wrestling career...  I need to praise TF out of @mikethemiz and @MaryseMizanin because I can't stop watching Miz &amp; Mrs. I catch myself ignoring the world while watching episodes I've already seen twice. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll say it again for those in the back(who think I'm a libtard)  I'm not left, I'm not right. I'm pro humanity, rights, choice, and I LOVE LGBTQ(I'm bi)  I didn't vote for Biden, I voted against Trump... #TrumpConceded #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IdiotB9720 @WrestleCritic Yo I'm not a big fan of the Bellas, but they upped their game 100% around the time we all learned they were with D-Bry and Cena... I actually enjoyed some of their stuff, so the hate makes no sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IdiotB9720 @WrestleCritic HAHA the attitude era mentality of "sex sells"   oh god, there was so much bad shit back then... Ruthless Aggression was so much better than the Attitude era, all around. I wish Trish/Lita happened in '04 not '99<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IdiotB9720 @WrestleCritic Say what you want about Stacy and Torrie Wilson... they were the beginning of "Divas" in the E.  I still remember Blaze, Bull Nakano, Bertha Faye... they did alright in the 90s when I was still a pre-teen. haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IdiotB9720 @WrestleCritic Oh no doubt... Trish and Lita were steps above Alundra Blaze and that era of women.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Miller_Sarah_ Nope. I'm no one's crush anywhere, ever, and I guess at this point I just prefer it that way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IdiotB9720 @WrestleCritic She was the best, during a time they barely cared... then they cared less when the "divas" came around... not her fault, but that keeps her from "greatest ever" contention. Same with Lita, as much as I love her.  Main event RAW? Again, trailblazers...not best ever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeanRossSapp Northeast/PA boy Manic!  I wish he used Twitter, but he's the longest-reigning Central PA champion ever. Hit me up, I'll connect you two... he stays in character too.... amazing stuff!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Easier said that done... being bipolar, I can tell you it's not that easy... but we're all in it together.   if they hate you, you'll spend weeks wondering why you suck. But you don't. they just suck. Talk to me if you need help!!! My DM is ALWAYS open!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kelseyjorogers Get off your ass, ignore your TEAMS and email... that's a start. I'm proud!  Also, wear a mask. Don't get COVID...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kelseyjorogers Just too excited to NOT be in front of a computer on your days off... A feeling I feel.  Sometimes you'll reconnect to your passion and "time off, I'm not doing anything" will go away. #KeepDreaming<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Make sure you check out @wrestlelamia   I've been binge-watching their stuff on YouTube. 10 wrestlers who said "F it" and broke kayfabe, 10 who never sold, oversold, accidentally won, etc... I'm loving this stuff! #WWERaw #SmackDown #WWE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheLegitESTBOSS I wish I could laugh react that stupid shit.  Not a Beyonce fan, but at least she's not overrated like @SashaBanksWWE is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@23_Revelation @TheBlueRiott Yes, but I stand firm that @IMPACTWRESTLING  is actively booking their women better than NXT. There are stories outside of the KO Title, while NXT is just rummaging for a #1 contender every few weeks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChampionOfDads @JamesStormBrand @WWERollins This is the first I've heard about this version of him. I'll definitely need to look into it then!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChampionOfDads THE NORTH!  You hear that @IMPACTWRESTLING ?!   We. Want. THE NORTH!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For real though:  Everyone loses their minds over James Storm and I think he's average, at best. Can some of you give me at least one James Storm match I need to watch to change my mind? Beer Money, AMW, whatever... hook me up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChampionOfDads @JamesStormBrand @WWERollins I don't get it.  Like, I get what you're saying, but I don't get why everyone thinks James Storm is better than average, at best. Enjoy him, for sure, I just don't get it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TRUTH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrestleCritic @x_Beast17_x HAHAHA You think Vince would make him play by the rules? Nah fam... Look at McAfee and his brand.  If Lesnar had a twitch, Vince would NEVER make him drop it. Vince is a twat like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBlueRiott Dude, without Char, Becky, and Ripley on WWE Main, Impact has, hands down, the best woman's roster.... AND people who care about that and book them well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealPaigeWWE Nah, if his mom sucked he'd probably never been born...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrestleCritic Top 5? #overrated   Paige, AJ Lee, Charlotte, Becky, Bayley, Asuka, Io, Ripley, Trish, Lita, Victoria, Mickie James, Shayna, Su Yung.... after that, probably 10 more and Sasha sandwich after them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally catching up on #SmackDown and I gotta say that Natalya is just... wow...  The absolute worst. Please stop letting her talk. #WOAT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeddiTurnbuckle The irony though is that his legit son Shane went off to make a ton of money with a 3rd party Japanese company. He is the executive vice-chairman of Ideanomics...AAAANNNDDD Still part of @WWE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrestleCritic Absolutely.... not.  Trailblazer? 100%  The reason we have the women we have now? Yup!  Best in WWE history?  No way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only reason Sasha has that title is because they did 87 Bayley/Asuka matches already this year.  She's gonna lose that belt after. She's overrated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikeVcella @chadopitz Lou Brown was made the GM after he sold those white wall tires.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gabynum1919 Yeah... ok. Point made.  I think I'd be hella hyped if they put the two in a cinematic match. Maybe mix Wyatt/Cena with Taker/Sting. Seeing old incarnations of surfer Sting, Ministry 'Taker, etc...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I dunno.... No thanks? I feel like we all want it but we'd all be uber disappointed like DX vs Brothers of Destruction in Saudi...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Playboi_Tino @PacmanCarterIII Calm down.  You can look, but you can't touch...    or real though, wtf?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kelseyjorogers 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RightsLGBTI @PalmerReport Yes, but he didn't kill himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you want to make a Drew vs Reigns video package and it takes half the day to figure out why your software shit the bed and get it fixed...    I think it's fixed. Let's do this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBlueRiott I dunno. Kinda want to see her go back to Impact, but AEW needs the assist in the woman's division to really solidify their division. Right now Impact doesn't need her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SOUND OFF: Talking with @GrappleLand about this 90-day no-compete clause, adding time on contracts for injuries/missed time, being an ind. contractor but EVERYTHING you do is dictated by the E...  What do you think about WWE contracts?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrappleLand @HutchIyh For sure. I mean, if you're not happy, you're not happy. What confuses me is when someone is never being used and ask for their release and the E is like "Nope. NO way." Adding time to contracts for injuries/time missed seems weird too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrappleLand @HutchIyh 3 months seems long but it's not really, I don't think. I'd imagine it's so they can't take the time and money WWE invested into making them a "star" and taking it to Impact, NJPW, ROH etc... 90 days for fans to "forget" about them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrappleLand @HutchIyh Legend is that Vince was furious when Rick Rude was taped on RAW(with DX) and that same night he was live on Nitro with nWo. I believe that's when 90-days started to become a thing, no positive though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrappleLand @HutchIyh I'm no lawyer and I've never seen a contract, but It seems to me that the ONLY way you don't end up with the 90-day no compete, no matter who ends the contract, is if you let it run out and don't resign like Moxley/Ambrose did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayAlletto 100% man. Everyone shitting on Vince for "firing her over a tweet about unionizing"  Man, there's 1,000 other things to hate Vince for that are actually legit.  Take a pick, stop acting like you know it all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yup. Still wasn't about a tweet. But ya'll can keep acting like you know everything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MJMcKean The irony is that they are the swamp.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IAM_THE_GENIUS_ @TheClosedFist  https://t.co/ZmzqgtiCTj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SashaBanksWWE You spelled "Overrated" wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like all three Rascalz, but c'mon... they're going to end up being 205 fodder by WrestleMania.  Fingers crossed tho...#205Live<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kelseyjorogers He's just a doucher in a neckerchief. #TeamVelma<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh! Look at that, it wasn't about her tweet. gee golly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWEGareth Imagine seeing a tweet and acting like you know the whole story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWEGareth @Zelina_VegaWWE Sure it does.  Just be a fan. You'll enjoy it all that much more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshtowne @HutchIyh WCW also did it before WWE started putting that clause on everyone... after years of WWE guys showing up on Nitro the next night.... But ok.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWEGareth @Zelina_VegaWWE Yet no one actually knows WHY she was released...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vega sure did get all the marks worked up on Twitter... Time to take the night off. #SmackDown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HutchIyh 90 day no-compete there, tough guy...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheClosedFist Or the fact that they laid down the law on 3rd party "vendors" like Twitch, and Onlyfans and she decided to have both running?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE  https://t.co/jmDUKqQDK9<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I don't know about "punk rock poser," but Toni is more Blink 182/punk pop while @RheaRipley_WWE   is more Manson/System/Soilwork.  The Wannabe vs The Reality. #WWENXT<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wwegunn @InnerN3rd I think they could pull it off, but could they do it with the grace that The Bar did?!  Hmmmm...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InnerN3rd I'm in! Would be a great night. I fully expect Kross to interrupt Balor next week to set up their match at 32.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWrestlingGirls I love most of the roster, for sure, but Joe Coffey has been my guy since Gallus was formed. His title match with Dunne is one of my all-time favorites!  https://t.co/0xLh742dKS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait, they ended at one point?!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 🤣🤣🤣 Every single time.   "Oh RAW's on? Wait, isn't it Febturday?!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 SAME! The entire network is down so there's not much to do anyways... so I'm bored, trying to stay awake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well no, there's King Cor.... Uhhh... there's Uce.... Um how about Sheam.... Yeah, it's all AJ.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 I can't wait to watch it tomorrow! My "vacation day" is going to be full of NXTUK over the past 4 weeks... been patiently waiting to binge!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shinedown has evolved with every single album. Each one better than the last... Same with Saliva and Linkin Park(though most people hate their 3rd album and more)  They didn't sell out, they bought in. Accept it or find a new favorite band.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 They tweak some words and give the album a new title... I'm a fan, but legit the same 10 songs for 40years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can 100% get behind this! #WWERAW<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 I see your point, but hear me out... Yes, I would. Poor Michael Meyers will see me with it and he'll just back away for the rest of the night.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Crews vs Corbin: Man, it took a little while for Corbin to catch on, but the good is hella good. Especially as a heel... Apollo Crews has been jerked around since his arrival into the WWE System. #NXTTakeover London 2015<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Revival... two dudes that prove Vince hates tag team wrestling. They should have been on #WWERAW taking over 4 life. #FTR #NXTTakeover 2015  Vince was always #SAWFT on tag team wrestling<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>"The Hoverboard Lock"  I'm just saying... it should really be a leg/ankle submission. No one is riding a hoverboard with their hands. #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've wanted to say something for WEEKS now, but Hey yo @sheetz, whoever decided to start using boxes for all the MTO food shouldn't be working with your company anymore... Dinner? RUINED #HungryAtWork<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just missed a @CGrimesWWE interview?!  OH MAN!! I hate you Sling TV....  #ToTheMoon #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WTF's up @Sling? Every channel on two different accounts getting that 8-12, now I can't even reinstall the app on my firestick... So much for my favorite night of the week<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 @GoldenJans The olive branch? I think that's a greek thing though.  Ceaser?  No that's a dressing... fuck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeremy8911 Literally, EVERYTHING he brought up as facts/truth was viral shit that was debunked numerous times... and the CULT CONTINUES.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Thanks to @JordanTracyTV, I will now be known as "The Shann Mann"  That is all, thank you.  Also, I appreciate your patience through this transition.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I hope Trump wins PA, that way all the rednecks can keep saying "Biden's not my president" and I can just sit on my front porch and laugh at every last one of them.  #Karma  #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Where'd those ballots come from then?!"  Are you fucking mental? Did you walk off the face of the Earth when mail-in ballots were an issue and everyone mailed them in?  Where the FUCK do you think they came from?!  Mailed in, being counted. Shut up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blows my mind that this guy wants to IGNORE the constitution, force states to STOP counting votes cause he's losing, and you STILL think he's God's gift?!  You're all fucking batshit crazy. Every last one of you. He's a deplorable human being... #Election2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayAlletto Yup. After a HORRIBLE match with her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZakFellows @JayAlletto Is that you RAWL-ins?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayAlletto Kinda yes, but the two different Niz Jax matches REALLY take away from the good they had. Excited for this Miz/Drew/Fiend/Orton story to keep playing out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THIS. Equipment can be replaced, your life cannot be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cities are preparing for civil unrest over an election?!  This is what ya boy, Agent Orange, has done to this country. Divisive, repulsive, and just pure hate. #VOTE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm just gonna turn off #WWERAW and go to bed. Thanks for ruining my night, TWICE @NiaJaxWWE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey #WWERAW, we did NOT need Nia Jax twice in one night... not even twice in one week.  You're killin' me!   #PoorRAWFans<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What's this, week 7? Week 8?  Why isn't #PoorLana trending? #WWERAW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 It's like someone wrecking the other guy before the match, then the ref asking if they can fight and THEN rings the bell... not a fan of that, but it works well for MITB cash-ins.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 If you look back, they've actually done that a handful of times the past 5 or so years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 Nope. The bell never rang.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They need to keep Orton and Fiend apart.  Let Orton go face Reigns, get wrecked, then Miz cashes in... Miz/Drew WWE Title, Orton/Fiend blood feud.  #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, can we get the person controlling the fan cheers/boos fired? Missing most of what Orton is even saying. #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When 1,000,000+ people pull the "why would I vote" bullshit, and it is bullshit - a complete cop out - that's 1,000,000+ voices not heard that could actually change things. "They both suck, I'm not voting" is just selfish immaturity.  #VOTE<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I know I'll go back and forth with @JayAlletto on dumb shit, but that's my boy. Give him a follow.   Without him and the PWPNation, I wouldn't have met Eron, Caden, or Tim Bell! (Or my archnemesis Toph, tbh)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayAlletto If you're voting for Trump, I'm not mad at you. I just don't understand the lack of compassion and humanity.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Halloween. It used to be my favorite holiday. But I just don't know how to feel feelings anymore. Joy is no longer a common concept. Happiness, a fleeting memory. Peace be with you,  and also without me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayAlletto Man, I can't even tell you the last time I sat down and tried to watch. Usually just a few random skits here and there on YouTube or FB... There will never be a mid-90s/mid-2000s cast again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBlueRiott Sami has been an enigma since his arrival. Trips saw his worth and then he went main and, well, he's been used well but they clearly don't have the faith in him that NXT did, but he's better off than like, Fandango and Adam Rose<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBlueRiott Been waiting for something like this since the Day KO showed up in NXT! #Yes #AND #PLEASE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man... growing up, getting married, having a career, having kids... it's overrated.  I've been happier being me than I ever was pretending that the life society tells us is normal was normal. Marriage, homeowner, (about to have kids) Nah. U do U.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JayAlletto You're so anti-media that you don't even know they have to say "alleged" or risk being sued bro.  In this day, we can't report shit without a bunch of fucking whacka-dos telling us we're idiots. Social Media hasFUCKED this whole country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE @SashaBanksWWE How awkward is she?!  Damn... ya'll think she's great but she's just overrated<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jeremy8911 I also may have just WAYYYY over thought that answer. lol  My b.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeremy8911 In Kayfabe, they're two different brands being run by two different companies.  He has no stake but since the first Draft they made it clear that FOX wants to beat USA and vice-a-versa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yooo... @BiancaBelairWWE is straight FIRE! The EST of the WWE. Everything she does is just absurdly entertaining! #SmackDown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"You gave me fortune, you gave me fame... you gave me POWER in your God's name!"  It's amazing that Trump hasn't used the one song that is a legit theme for him: Cult of Personality. What says you @kenjeong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPNation Always my brother! &lt;3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPNation I kill myself. OVERRATED AF.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>STRAIGHT TO THE MOON!  #GrimesForChampion #HalloweenHavoc #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't have much to say about Gonzalez. Haven't seen enough in-ring.... but let me tell you, ready or not, Ripley is 100% the person to put her in a feud with so she can learn and grow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamiZayn Why? I never said that... So rude.  Maybe Sami does suck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPBITW9 So much better than Bray/Orton from 3 years ago. I was legit worried, but Grimes can make ANYTHING turn to gold at this point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those Mysterio #HalloweenHavoc tights tho... Hot damn! #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man, Grimes is amazing... he made this work cause we know Doc didn't....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPBITW9 Yo I like Lorcan, but I'd laugh react that if I could because it's legit truth!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LOL literally the best show of the year and people are over there watching/complaining about Dynamite.  #Smart #WWENXT #HalloweenHavoc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeremy8911 Hard pass on BOTH... but yeah, Burch is lame AF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPBITW9 Lorcan isn't a Brit tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a swerve!  And I don't mean Isaiah Scott!  Man, McAfee is gold! Pete Dunne is Gold! Lorcan is Gold! #HalloweenHavoc #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy shit! McAfee, Lorcan, Burch and Pete Dunne inside the #WarGames with Undisputed Era...  Sign. Me. UP! #HalloweenHavoc #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YESSSS!!!!   PETE MU'FUCKIN DUNNE!!!!  #HalloweenHavoc has be over here geekin out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPBITW9 Now you got my mouth watering for some Theory/Gargano vignettes!  Hot damn!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not gonna lie, the #powercouple schtick would be great on #Smackdown but I honestly don't care to see Gargano leave #WWENXT, ever. Dude is legit the face of the brand and deserves that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPBITW9 Especially now that we all have to wonder if the masked man comes back to help Candice too... my money is on it being Ciampa and they all hug as NXT goes off the air.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ghostface is going to help Candice beat Io for the woman's title, then unmask... Gargano, Candice, and Ciampa all hug and celebrate as #HalloweenHavoc goes off the air. #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPBITW9 Oh yeah, 100% both leaving with titles tonight! #powercouple #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's gotta be Ciampa!  #WWENXT #HalloweenHavoc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope they don't finally kill Johnny Gargano tonight. #HalloweenHavoc #WWENXT #NXTNATitle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeremy8911 I'd imagine they'd have to be brain dead to start...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love her so much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Priest vs Gargano #NXTNATitle Who you got?    My money is on the power couple leaving with both titles, tbh. #HalloweenHavoc #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only two minutes into #HalloweenHavoc and it's already the best episode of ANY network televised wrestling show of the past decade+ #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alright! Home just in time. Lets do this #WWENXT This is your night to shine! #HalloweenHavoc<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Welp, looks like RAWs Woman's Team is set to lose... #PoorLana<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lupo_138 Hopefully never. #Garbage #DivasAreDead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 There are not enough women. lolol #PoorLana #TableTown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PoorLana here comes week 6 of going through that announce table. #PoorRusevMiro #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*Drew throws MITB up the ramp Samoa Joe: "Ha! Guess you don't have to worry about that being cashed in"  You're right. Especially since Drew doesn't even have a friggin' title, slappy.  #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReckoningRTRBTN It's called meth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 It would be badass, but I'm just excited about the idea of seeing Pat McAfee get in that War Games match and get a whoopin' from Adam Cole BAY-BAY!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 Yeah, and everyone's crying like we're not gonna get War Games anyways.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ummm... wut?  #RETRIBUTION #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah crap... Zayn vs Lashley.  Zayn is gonna be Smackdown's only loss... maybe one of two.  USA won last year, FOX wins this year, and that's why NXT isn't being added.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeremy8911 I love Orton, but I think I'd rather see that so we get Miz/Drew and Orton/Fiend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never forget that Randy burned down Bray Wyatt's "house" where the spirit of Sister Abagail lived.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But wait... R-Truth hit someone. That means the tag match was over on a DQ.  No?  What the hell is a 24/7 championship man?!  #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't complain about Series not having the #WWENXT  brand this year when you know DAMN WELL that they're going to give us War Games no matter what!! #WarGames BAY-BAY!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Elias will cost Jeff, Jeff will cost Elias...If Riddle goes to Survivor Series, I'm willing to bet that Seth does NOT make the Smackdown team. #WWERAW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shane: "I don't wanna do #RAWUnderground anymore."  Vince: "Good. I think AJ needs a bodyguard cause it'll good shit."  #WWERAW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And just like that, Miz &amp; Morrison #WWERaw main event gold!#CORRECT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Half of ONE segment with #MITB and Miz has already been a better Mr. MITB than Otis ever was. #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWEGareth 3 out of 4 ain't bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've actually made good use of this pic taken for a Full Sail class project in 2015... more comedy gold to come!  https://t.co/WCF6ACMEfS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 I'm just glad it wasn't Lana going through the announce table, again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 Nah, I think Vince got excited about the Samoan Dynasty stable over on #SmackDown and everyone forgot they had stables on #RAW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WN_Net Odyssey, Xyon,... who writes this shit? Does Triple H know about these name changes?! HBK is probably laughing all the way to the bank.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 I've honestly been trying to figure that out since the first-ever appearance of Retribution. #HIAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nekrosangelo Just in the E.  Bayley, Becky, Asuka, Charlotte, Io... Sasha is somewhere after all of them. #HIAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MuseMister That's gonna change on Friday cause Sasha can't ever keep a title. Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nekrosangelo I mean, every time she wins a title, she loses it back a week later... she's so fucking overrated. Bunch of rubes crying she's the goat?  Nah fam.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeremy8911 No thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sasha wins a title... Gonna lose it in a week, AGAIN.   How the fuck is she GOAT?  She's garbage. #HIAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sasha wins?   Welp, I'm going to bed... #overrated #HIAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrestleCritic I hope he sits on in though. Let him and Morrison run a muck on RAW with the briefcase. #HIAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sasha is overrated af. Don't even @ me bro. #HIAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope Miz cashes in and steals the title out from under Orton. #HIAC #VinceHatesTagTeams<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nekrosangelo If they're right, I'm all for a Samoan Dynasty stable... I need something to wash the taste of retribution out of my mouth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nekrosangelo It was soooo well done from the start. At first I thought Uso getting the shot was a lame throw away feud. Damn Uce...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That last 5 minutes was rough... and  I don't mean it was bad. Damn Uce...#HIAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>C'mon Roman... he can't say "I Quit" if he's dead!  #HIAC  That drive by with the steel stairs tho... good God almighty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I always liked Reigns,  but Heel Roman is the best Roman. #HIAC #WWEHIAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ATTENTION: It's almost November. Shouldn't we be talking about (and praying for) NXT vs RAW vs SMACKDOWN at Survivor Series?!  That's when Adam Cole turns on UE/NXT and joins #SmackDown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeddiTurnbuckle Been blocked ever since Ascension debuted on #WWERAW and JBL trashed them on commentary. Wasn't gonna let that slide...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 JBL has always been a twat waffle. I'm not shocked by what happened.  I'm cool with Miz being Miz on RAW with the briefcase tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No way they'd let Otis cash in on Reigns. Might as well let Miz and Morrison run amuck on RAW with the briefcase. I'm cool with this plan... #Smackdown #LawAndOtis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bayley is the perfect woman. Sasha is hoodrat AF. #SmackDown  #BayleyIsBae<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shorty G quits and now we're Ready, Willing and GABLE! #SmackDown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HHH to Gable: #WWERaw  didn't want you. #Smackdown didn't want you.... Come home. Come to NXT and make them look bad."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THEORY: "I quit!"  VINCE: "That's such good shit! Someone make Shorty G quit too!"  #SmackDown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First Tez, now @BiancaBelairWWE!  #Smackdown #PowerCouple  Belair is the future. Mark my words<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only good thing about Miz/Otis is the APA running the Thunderdome Court. #SmackDown #LawAndOtis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That frog splash from @MontezFordWWE is a thing of PURE BEAUTY... #SmackDown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaitlynJK With all the Google searches I've done because of working in the news, I'm sure I'm already on 5 lists... they don't seem too bad.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>"Elton John gets his own Barbie Doll" is the most FABULOUS thing that could have happened in 2020!  Niiice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeremy8911 Typical know-it-all while knowing nothing Smarks. fuck em<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Disney could sell Marvel to Apple TV and I still wouldn't support that shit company or give them a single penny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's true, you can't always get what you want... and I think the sooner I realize that the better off I'll be and the less I'll be hurt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 I usually save it for Friday morning before I get to go into work late. Let me know how it is this week!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone on our Facebook saying Trump won that debate and I seriously wonder if they even watched it... #Debates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 Lots of alcohol!  lol   Nah, just blessed with patience. That 10-day vacation came at just the right time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah man... This is AMAZING!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AKamaraSZN Agreed, mostly. I'm not big on either, but we can't do 4 more years... to each their own! This is America tho, we'll come together somehow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 There was a point where Trump was doing COVID updates EVERY DAY and I had no choice but to listen that I almost quit my job. Glad I didn't, but it would have saved a mental breakdown during my vacation. haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 I'm 100% over it, but working local news, I kinda have no choice but to follow literally everything. 2021 won't be here soon enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Working in local news, I'll tell you that PA had their largest single-day COVID case count since early April, even being "Blue".  The Trump supporters actually listen to that twat and don't care about masks, distancing etc... lead by example, dick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MandaAiley Same, but with Pennsylvania.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did Trump even hear the mod ask that last question?!   What a dolt. #Debates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's because you're full of hot air, Trump. #Debates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nekrosangelo LOL Biden would be Taker. Trump is 100% a McMahon, through and through  https://t.co/PHN8BvNhMJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The one thing Trump is good at!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@megynkelly Just based on your kid's names I know all I need to about you.  You're a COVIDIOT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just let them start throwing fists. The last one standing is president.  This also solves all the bullshit of Mail-in vs In-person voting. #Debates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeremy8911 Yeah, we thought THIS was the end of it too.  https://t.co/uZjcahg8kg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump: "Blah blah blah Crime bill again" Biden: "Ohh god..."  I'm dead ya'll!  #Debates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh god... The irony of Trump calling someone a baby... WOW!  What a mewling quim. #Debates2020 #potcallingthekettleblack<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Q: Who is the last president to only serve ONE term in office?  A: @realDonaldTrump   #Debates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump thoughts: "Only 520?  That seems low. We can do better with 4 more years."  Yup. #Debates2020 #Immigration<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spotastic  https://t.co/2xYPuFhgrR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gomez27 He must have been watching a LOT of Law &amp; Order SVU lately.  wow... #Debates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump: "Minimum wage should be a state thing"  It is a state thing. Any state at any given time can raise their minimum wage.  WTF is this guy doing with his life cause he's sure as shit not running the country.  #Debates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biden with that "Are you fucking insane?" look and tone when talking about how Dems had a 2nd relief ready for 5 months.  Hilarious! #Debates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"He never came from Scranton"  Alright, here's the shit-show we've been waiting for! #Debates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The microphone mute has been working GREAT!  #Sarcasm #Debates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He wants to come up with better healthcare....  What?  He's been saying for 4 years that he already has better healthcare plans.     This guy lies through his teeth and I do NOT trust his supporters. #Debates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goodbadnerdypod His Wonka gum must be apple pie instead of blueberry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jong is a "Thug. A THUG"  I'd imagine Pence is already on the phone (in his PJs) gossipping:  "KIM! You won't believe what Biden called you!"   #Debates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When Trump's audit started I was an XL t-shirt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nekrosangelo DAMMIT RIPPER!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@karamiller76 I hear they hide these big words in the search and find on the back of his Trix cereal box. #Debates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People want the Trump family in the office for like 30 years.  If you want a monarchy, move to England, you dolts. #Debates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can we all just vote Biden and get a clean slate and we can duke it out with two better guys in 2024?  #Debates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump on Twitter: "Fauci is a moron"  Trump when having to face Biden: "I'm not knocking Fauci..."  #Debates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone have video footage of Nancy Pelosi actually dancing in the streets of Chinatown?!  I bet it's entertaining AF #Debates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I learned anything from my ex-wife, just saying a problem will go away won't make it go away.  My b... I'm still sorry about that toaster over, girl.   #Covid_19 #Debates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just remember that Biden had ZERO authority to try and handle COVID-19... don't listen to Trump's finger pointing. #Debates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nekrosangelo I always joke in the newsroom when he's late for his Coronavirus Pandemic updates that they told him he has to finish his happy meal first or else he won't get the toy before bedtime.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Debates2020 Drinking Game:   Take a shot every time Trump shouts at someone after they mute his microphone. I bet you won't even had to worry about COVID or anything else after that... #DebateTonight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We all know Trump doesn't give a fuck. He's gonna start shouting after they mute him. I give it 37 minutes before he walks off the stage like his mommy just told him he can't have another cookie. #Debates2020 #DebateTonight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, did Seth leave Family Guy to be a writer/director/producer with #AEWDynamite ?  What was that shit Jericho tried to pull?  #Yikers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 It was a good hour...  that ending tho!  #OMG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kenny Omega winning? Obvious AF  Oney Lorcan and Danny Burch winning with the help of Pat McAfee?!  #MINDBLOWN  #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As JR would say: IT'S PAT MCAFEE IT'S PAT MCAFEE!  @PatMcAfeeShow shocked the system tonight! #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HOLY SHIT!  It's Pat McAfee!!!!!!  I LOVE IT  #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ANDNEW #WWENXT Tag Team Champions!!!  I love Oney Lorcan!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty good episode of #WWENXT. Can't wait for #HalloweenHavoc next week.    Lumis vs Grimes... TO THE MOON! I love both of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HELL YEAH!  A little Retro AG on #WWENXT!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would have LOVED to see Kyle O'Reilly and Oney Lorcan team up tonight.  Damn.  #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FiteTV The look when people tweeting about AEW while you're trying to watch #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish I had a mini training Wheel.  Johnny's evolved this heel gimmick into something else! I love it. #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is Jake Atlas still moving... wow #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WHOA!!!  Suicide dive turned into a Spanish fly to the outside!  #HOLYSHIT #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only so long you can love yourself before you feel something is missing. Just another day in the life though. Always #Billieve<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh yeah, Swerve and the other two didn't even get an entrance.... Gee, I wonder who will win?!  #Fantasma #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That new Bronson Reed entrance is pretty sweet. I guess they dropped Thicc Boy as he's now "Colossal Bronson Reed"   Honestly looks like it's the start of a Reed push! #WWENXST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not taking anything away from Gonzalez, but I can't take her as this big threatening monster knowing that her "Olympic history" is speed walking. #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 Commercials.  Keeping this update game strong. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 Kushida with the german suplex on Ciampa.  Hell of a win for Kushida!  Give me Kushida/Balor at WARGAMES! #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 The Dream came out looking like R-Truth 15 years ago, Ciampa messed him up. Kushida is trying to wreck them both.  So far so good!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The funny thing is that Trump doesn't need to worry about Social Security... there's going to be plenty of money after his botched COVID response kills a LOT more older, retired Americans. #vote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mariee3443 I completely agree. It'll happen one of these days, no doubt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kelseyjorogers I'm confused about why people have been watching it for like 20 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From behind, with those dreads and that outfit, I thought K-Kwik returned and joined the #WWENXT brand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm glad they're doing Halloween Havoc next week. You can tell Trips/NXT respect the heritage of these old PPVs more than Vince ever did. #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayAlletto In my defense, I just really like food.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not gonna lie... I love Ciampa, one of my favorites, but Kushida would legit wreck both him and Dream. #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's happening on #WWERaw tonight? @BraunStrowman vs @RealKeithLee, that's what! #BaskInHisGlory  Also, Register to vote. It's the last day to do that here in Pennsylvania.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2020 has been messed up. And I think it's because of all the people who made jokes about seeing clearly with 20/20 vision and shit...  This is karma. You brought the apocalypse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact that I want to lose weight so I can wear clothes that my father would hate just tells me I'm not totally straight... and I'm ok with that, cause I'm not (totally) straight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisfluming @MaraWilson He also wrote a song about a guy playing the piano and never shut the fuck up with his harmonica.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't even argue science anymore... it's not worth the headache to listen to the clueless, uneducated Trump supporters when they reply... because then I laugh before contemplating killing myself. What a cult of sheep. #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes family isn't family. Don't use your brain to figure it out, follow your heart.  Your brain will only tell you what you were taught... your heart will show you those feelings, and those true "I'll do anything for you" connections.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayAlletto The problem is that people won't ignore it and they are led by fake and false information.... Big tech is walking a fine line though, and it's only time before Congress finds a way to topple these monopolies. Until they find out they can make more money from it....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayAlletto I look at that and just gotta respect Seth. After his knee injury against Kane, he really evolved his in ring style and relied more on the story telling than "OH SHIT!" kinda moves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would geek TF out if the next Spidey movie had Tom, Tobey, and Garfield all show up as the web-slinger from the various universes Dr. Strange opens. #Marvel #SpidermanDoesWhateverASpiderCan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EronTalks @olivernorgrove @JayAlletto It's still not Seth RAWLINS... I thank you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EronTalks @olivernorgrove @JayAlletto ... Ya'll gave me shit for MONTHS over it. It's not my fault he didn't know how to pronounce the name he was given and they just rolled with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EronTalks @olivernorgrove @JayAlletto ROLE-INS is vastly different than RAW-LEY  But I did watch a few episodes of The Asylum and just laughed when I heard myself pronounce ROLE-INS after all these years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayAlletto FINALLY! He says something I can agree with. Even though I LOVE NXT like, super fanboy kinda love, TNA's first 6-8-ish years were AMAZING<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@olivernorgrove @JayAlletto @EronTalks LOL I've been looking! I thought it was an episode of The Asylum on the PWP Youtube, but it's not. I know I was wearing my red "HAIL" shirt (Hail Hydra, calm down bitch tits) but I can't find it anywhere<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@olivernorgrove @JayAlletto You're British, you don't even know....  But yes, it's even more trash than the taco pizza. The dough was stuck to the box, it was soggy, and they use way too much mustard in the "ketchup based" sauce<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They had PPV pre-shows 20 years ago... we called them Sunday Night Heat and they were a LOT more fun to watch than preshows now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never forget @iamsleepzzz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayAlletto Don't forget about the Domino's Pizza that plays twice during every commercial break. Gotta get that taco pizza(which is garbage)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yo for real, if you don't follow @JayAlletto , give him a follow. from PWP Nation to the Alletto Show, he's worth a minute or two of your day!  Much love homie!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayAlletto  https://t.co/EK3qmZJWNK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RDream22 That might have been the best episode of #WWERaw  from start to finish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayAlletto Cancel Cancel Culture?!  And the plot thickens... hopefully like a milkshake cause I'm all in for this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevenCheah @RawIsGibby Oh, we still count that 24/7 as a title?  Good to know. lol<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JayAlletto Maybe that's why my step-dad liked him so much.  Same guy that in 2005 told me he'd disown me if I ever brought a black girl home... Fuck him<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hollywood makes us watch two people who seem like us, but they can just up and take a trip to Paris on a whim.  They have us all fooled. Most of their 4 million viewers can't even go to Paris if they plan and save for 5 years.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Sign me up for that one!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayAlletto @ZakFellows Yeah man, 100% unnecessary for them to have a 2-hour preshow before a 5-hour actual show.  I'm gonna take in an "oxygen tank" that's actually vodka so I can get through those first 2 hours. haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZakFellows @JayAlletto Two things in life I want to do: WrestleMania, and NXTUK... because the UK crowd is always just fucking insane and so much fun to watch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayAlletto That feeling after a good, loud indy show is what I'd imagine crack addicts feel when they take their first-ever hit. lol, Dopamine man, it's a hell of a drug your brain makes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NXT and AEW, do you watch both?  Which one do you watch live?   Growing up, we had to flip between RAW and NITRO, or pull out what we called a VHS tape for what was called a VCR to record one.  We were dinosaurs. We are old.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Politics. The only job in the world where you can make up blatant lies about the other person/people and it not be slander or libel.  What is this world we've created?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't publicly shit on Lana because i'm such a big fan of Rusev/Miro. Dude was another dropped ball in the WWE title hunt.   Ryback, Truth, Rusev all should have beat Cena in those heel feuds for the WWE Title. Wade Barrett too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillNeville87 Fuck that guy. I geeked out like a mo'fo at that scene.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WWE @LarsSWWE @WWERomanReigns @LanaWWE 1. Roman Reigns 2. Toni Storm 3. No thanks 4. Ditto<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mikeVcella Space Jam... Fuck anyone who disagrees.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SupineSmokey He does, but Cole acted amazed that he won with a submission... which honestly, against Braun, that was shitty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey Cole, Reigns hasn't used a submission because he's never been in an "I Quit" match... It's obvious booking. #SmackDown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someone needs to tell @WWERollins that those Flood Pants don't work for him. Jesus hated flood pants. It's in the book of Matthew. 27:45 or something #SmackDown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Bar - Tag Titles, Sami - IC TItle, - Shinsuke - The Universal title that he deserved to win when he was feuding AJ Styles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Bar has reunited with Shinsuke for the night... Imagine adding Sami Zayn to that.  What a stable. What a "foreign Heel" story there would be. #UnAmericans #SmackDown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never a huge Jeff fan, but I can't deny that he's one of the best in the WWE... but whatever, #LARSWINSLOL #SmackDown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PacmanCarterIII If Raw Underground is dead already, then he's going to wind up in a feud with Dabba Kato, and Braun isn't the kind of guy that needs to be in the ring with a green newbie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeremy8911 Sadly, Shorty G was only there so Vince could argue that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sadly, with Jeff going to #WWERaw , we know he's going to be fodder to put Lars over on #SmackDown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimmsGetzIt  https://t.co/XJtHsPzidm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>F' Lars. Fire him. Give the gimmick to Braun. He does it better anyway. #SmackDown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>100 freaking percent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shorty G: "Oh shit. Let me get in the ring too. It's been months"  #SmackDown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When showing/introducing D-Bry on the stage with Braun next to him, did that look Braun give him hint at a heel turn?  Let him attack D-Bry and go to #WWERAW as a monster heel again?  I dunno... #SmackDown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RDream22 That worked so damn well because they didn't go with a basic "Edge would be Shawn and Orton would be HHH" You never see an Orton like that. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TopRopeNation @kyler413 I definitely want a heel AJ/face MacIntyre feud. But also, AJ/Keith Lee, AJ/Ricochet, AJ/Hurt Business...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TopRopeNation @kyler413 AJ coming to RAW so he has some fresh guys to make look just as good as he is.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Happy to see republicans are deciding to vote against Trump, but they'll probably vote republican for everything else...  Nothing will get done in DC. But maybe that's ok. Maybe they'll be forced to work together. Maybe I just have dumb, high hopes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Is Twitter working again? I gotta tell @SashaBanksWWE that she's fucking OVERRATED<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoonTimeDweller Yeah, I'm excited AF for Halloween Havoc, but I'm telling you right now, if the Yetti shows up, I'm never watching #WWENXT ever again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love Shotzi, but did anyone else find her "Spin the wheel, make a deal" promo awkward and kinda hard to listen to? #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, Shotzi is hosting Halloween Havoc soooo... I'm gonna say Candace wins this and faces Io at Havoc. #wwenxt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeremy8911 Of course Eric didn't like it. It didn't involve a group of assholes trying to take over a company. The dude probably goes apeshit for Retribution.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They keep mentioning that Theory has lost a lot, but it's to top guys.  Is that really a thing? "Yeah I never won, but I never faced someone mid-card or under"  Bro that makes you the jobber, no matter how good you are. #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Over it. So over it. If others can do the bare minimum, then I guess I will to.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Lythas5 and even that I think was dumb luck that someone had the idea to use her in that Wyatt Swamp match. But even Bliss/Cross was a good story... Smackdown is better at it than RAW 100%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lythas5 For real. Plus they put so much of it all on Becky, Asuka, Char, and Bayley that when there's only one on each show, the division suffers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boy, between the (Former) IIconics, Lana, and now soon Eva Marie... they really are trying to bring the Divas back.  This infuriates me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She says her "personal and religious views would not affect her rulings."  And her God has smited her for that lie. #SCOTUShearings  https://t.co/MGMzklbNaz<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>He doesn't care about the expert.... what makes you truly believe he cares about you? It's all ego... his ego. He's a cancer that feeds off of your "I'm not racist, but..."  He's a garbage human and a garbage leader.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In PERFECT English "I moved here from Russia and I worked hard at this..."   Yeha, ok Lana... Ok.  #RawTalk #WWERaw #WWEDraft<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Riddick Moss and Arturo Ruas drafted to #WWERaw....  They really wasted draft picks for #RAWUnderground... those two, Braun...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lana.... bringing back the Divas one week at a time... #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope Rusev is happy... #WWERaw #LanaLovesTables<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel like I should expand my twitter to follow more than just wrestling fans....  NAAAHHHHH!!! #WrestlingBABY!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Psyched. I loved Garza since his first few NXT matches. So glad he got to stay on the Main Roster, now they need to really let him shine!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And there it is... the battle royal is the main event of #WWERaw. @MsCharlotteWWE is going to make her surprise return too. #Woooo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jadenprestn OH YEAH!  She's that "sexy blonde" vignette we've been seeing on Smackdown.  Interesting if she shows up on RAW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, if the woman's Battle Royal is the main event, I fully expect Flair's surprise return. #WWEDraft #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeremy8911 100% not taking away from those guys, but when he went from RIngmaster to Stone Cold, his move set and matches changed because he didn't HAVE TO BE technically sound and great like someone like Bret Hart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeremy8911 That's the thing.  Was Stone Cold great in the ring? Was Cena great in the ring? The Rock?  Just because you can be, doesn't mean you have to be. In their world, characters sell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPBITW9 Nah they have..... uh... Oh there's..... ummm....  Well fuck. Guess they need to feed everyone to Asuka on RAW before Flair returns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMattCardona Virgil lookin super lonely. Just waiting for his $17 for the picture.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love how they brought a bunch of women from Smackdown over to #WWERaw. They can all be fed to Asuka until Flair is ready to come back and take her throne.... blah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Up next after #WWERaw is The Bradshaw Bunch!  Also up next is me turning the channel...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's pure bliss.... no pun, ok ok ... all pun intended!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think @WWEBrayWyatt  and @AlexaBliss_WWE  just might be my new favorite thing!  2020 was worth it to get to this point!  #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't worry. Andrade and Vega are both going to stay on #WWERaw.  Andrade needs out of this storyline and get his push. The dude is HELLA good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeremy8911 You know, seeing him in that suit made me think of Michael Clarke Duncan as Kingpin in the Daredevil movie with Affleck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOOOO!  Ricochet vs Cedric?! If it's half as good as AJ/Seth/Hardy, we're in for a damn TREAT tonight!  #hurtbusiness #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, a tag match just so Nia can put Lana through the announce table.  I think I'll go to the pooper. #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love the #WWEDraft, but I'll be honest... it's NOT the same without the random surprise NXT pick.  #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ELIAS IS BACK!  The #WWEDraft is totally turning into the Night after Mania with all these surprise returns.  #ImLovingIt #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn. I watch on Sling TV and when I'm looking at Twitter, I realize the stream is a good minute behind. lol  #SpoilersandShit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Orton takes the title... IF he does... I want Jeff to be the guy to beat him and get one last big run. Jeff/Orton had such a great fued last year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FollowTheCreed2 100 freaking Percent!  It's funny that 20 years ago I couldn't care less about the Hardyz. Now I love everything they do!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeanRossSapp MVP paid the USA executives off so they'd draft Retribution so they could get their hands on them and tear them apart?!  Yeah, I'm not buying it either....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 We've seen it a lot. And I'll keep watching it. Then I'll watch it more. Then I'll watch them fight over who gets the good room in the retirement home. They are two people that could legit #FightForever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's that? Oh, it's just 3 former world champions doing what they do BEST in that ring!  #MarkingOut #WWERaw #NeverForgetJeff  https://t.co/9aNHUbmrgn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes I don't care about the draft. Sometimes, like with Jeff, I love the shake-up and giving him a fresh roster to work with. Same with AJ, Rollins, and Big E<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hardcore_Fan101 100% not what that story is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"You just keep steppin'! This was never Monday Night Rollins anyway haha" -AJ  Love this. Give us a triple threat! AJ/Seth/Hardy #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrestleCritic But he's also safe on Smackdown anyways since the US Title was drafted with Hurt Business on Friday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While watching #WWERaw and the #WWEDraft, I just wanna let you know my boy @iamsleepzzz can spit like a MF'er but he can wrestle too:   https://t.co/gCWRyOgW9q<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrestleCritic How scared can anyone really be of a guy names "Slap Jack"?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NICE! Definitely thought they'd put Lee on Smackdown and that's cool.  Psyched he and King Corbin stayed put.  #WWERaw   Also, Bliss to RAW.... what a shocker after taking Fiend...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope every PPV has a backstage segment with The Street Profits and New Day!  #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Freak Accident?  I think it was an accident to bring Lars back... #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MultiverseTom @Matmenpodcast Two towns south of Suplex City, no doubt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Snitsky.... erm... I mean, LARS IS HERE!  He's lookin' for them booty pics! #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lythas5 I dunno man. Early Nattie was good, I enjoyed the matches... somewhere along the lines though she just became cringe-fest for me. I don't know what it is...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>COVID-19 might kill you...  I'll kill myself if I need to see Miz, Morrison, Mandy, Dana, Natalya, and Lana all in that ring on mics again. #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope Natalya gets drafted to HOME.  Girl, bye!  #WWERaw #WWEDraft<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOW... That KO/Black chair spot... gives me a panic attack. Well done boys! #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I swear to GOD if Bray coming to #WWERaw means he'll start wrestling in the red light again, I'm going to rip my eyes out of my skull.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Profits, Keith Lee, Owens to #SmackDown   Bray, Alexa, and Braun to #WWERaw (by the end of the night)  #Predictions #WWEDraft<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember, if Orton moves to Smackdown, he'll likely lose at #WWEHIAC so both titles don't end up on #SmackDown  #WWEDraft #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here we go!  Night 2 of the #WWEDraft on #WWERaw!  Just remember if Lars gets drafted to RAW, it wasn't his fault... #Snitsky2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayAlletto @Lythas5  https://t.co/OVhitTyT2j<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lythas5 All in good fun my dude. I've been poking at Eron about The Office since the start of his PWP days I believe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lythas5 Give em a minute, they're watching a good show like Seinfeld!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Churches want their bible to dictate laws in the country for them, but they ain't gonna pay taxes?  Fuck on outta here Amy BARRETT with your two Rs and two T's.  I'd rather put Jeff Jarrett in that seat, ya whore!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm gonna need someone to explain to @Lythas5 that 'The Office' is fucking garbage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really hope that when The Street Profits get drafted to #SmackDown, they meet up with The New Day and have a party/ceremony to exchange the red and blue tag titles with each other on #WWERaw!  #WWEDraft<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, I understand now. If they're White, they're a militia and if they're ANYTHING else, they're straight up terrorists.  Got it...  #ICantRollMyEyesANYHarder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IAM_THE_GENIUS @USA_Network  https://t.co/iNnBttXL8p<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWMania This just ruined my entire week... FUCK!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ever notice at indy shows how a heel will come back at you with a "your mom" line?  I beat them though...  Me: "I don't like you Samson!" Him: "I don't care. Your mom loves me!" Me: "Yeah and I don't like her either!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBlueRiott No doubt. I just want to enjoy a packed, raucous Indy Show live and start all kinds fo stupid chants!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBlueRiott I agree, but let's be honest.... the UK crowds are the freaking BEST! I can't wait until NXTUK gets to have them back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyNemmity Dude. I turned the local indy show here in central PA into a weekly show on our local news station's digital platform and I completely agree. It was like pulling teeth one of the commentators to understand viewers don't know wrestlers like we do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shout out to @callmekrisstat and @_AdenaSteele! Two excellent women that came into Eclipse Wrestling while I was doing video production. Great talent, for sure. #TheFutureIsFemale<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheBlueRiott Great stuff.  That crowd is the reason they signed Alexander. They were so damn hot for him! Wish they were doing more with him on RAW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElaynaBlack @AndyNemmity Hard to pick a #1 nowadays, but he's 100% on that small list of contenders! I'm glad he's getting to shine outside of the E.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RDream22 We can say what we want about the 'E not giving fans what they want, but we can't deny that they sure know how to work WrestleMania. Matches people talk about forever!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyNemmity As in the band with a lead singer who had Kurt Cobain killed?  Meh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RDream22 Both HBK/Taker Mania matches Taker/HHH Mania28 (HIAC) HBK/Austin Mania 14 Austin/Hart Mania 13 2 out of 3 falls DIY/Revival at Takeover Pete Dunne/Joe Coffey NXT UK Takeover for the title Dunne/Bate Takeover Chicago for UK title<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealScottRandom @indiewrestling Oh great! Really appreciate you letting me know... although now I don't know if I'm going to get any sleep tonight!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WN_Net  https://t.co/OKA1OvEEFE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealScottRandom I'm absolutely gonna check stuff out, for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In case you were wondering why Kal Jak looked so familiar...#Bloodsport  https://t.co/I95ZwXkoLQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Bloodsport is what #RAWUnderground would be if the McMahon's weren't involved in it. Digging this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn.  When the one you let get away because you were an immature clown is getting married... Ouch.  Dah well, at least I still have @WWENetwork  Undertaker at WrestleMania(not you Taker vs Brock) will never break my heart!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're going to stop buying Oreos because they put out rainbow creme filling to support LGBTQ...   Good! Your bigoted ass doesn't deserve the magic that is an @Oreo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@80sWrestling_ Hate to admit it, but as a kid, I first knew him as The Stalker in the 'E... so glad I grew up and got to REALLY appreciate his work everywhere else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bryanalvarez And it was just a Smackdown match... that's sad and speaks volumes on how he's actually been booked in his matches.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NO WAY!  Fake News? I mean, the Trump administration would NEVER twist things to fit their agenda... Nooooo, not Fuehrer @realDonaldTrump   #MewlingQuim #dolt<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jeremy8911 For real! He's like Orton... Good face, PERFECT heel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I haven't seen anyone mention Charlotte Flair in the #WWEDraft... spoiler: she returns on Monday and immediately gets drafted to #WWERaw and is handed a title match against Asuka in the main event.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shout out to the legit future of Woman's wrestling, and my favorite to watch. May she get drafted to #WWERaw  for her birthday!   Happy Birthday @RheaRipley_WWE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lythas5 @NishGuy Never really followed them. The FITE app that I use on my Firestick has great stuff. Not sure about Shimmer, but I've been watching Championship Wrestling from Hollywood on there for free and it's AWESOME!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnKramer19 @JohnyScissors @itsvedatime I was hoping it would!  Cheers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradEYoung @BankofAmerica Sounds like almost all of my interactions with Verizon customer service!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnKramer19 @JohnyScissors @itsvedatime Actually, I simply said that guac is shit and people will STILL pay $3 for it at chipotle. I based it on people willingly paying for it. But your smarmy, completely wrong opinion tells me everything I need to know about you, doesn't it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnKramer19 @JohnyScissors @itsvedatime  https://t.co/8vQ6iuvt7y<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's always @sheetz.... ALWAYS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenA1181 I like that it uses my history to compile various mixed tapes. They're nice to have playing randomly on my firestick while working digital news all day. Keeps me from losing my mind some days. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenA1181 I dunno man. The times I am in the car, I find myself constantly flipping through the channels and there's maybe 10 I'll stop on and see what they're playing. It's not bad, I'll just stick with  Spotify tho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeremy8911 Man, I don't care what anyone says, Riley and The Miz were a great combo together on the Main. Riley should have gotten a push in the 2014/15ish years of NXT before Joe, Shinsuke, Drew etc... all showed up<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnyScissors @itsvedatime Because guac is garbage and ya'll spending $3 to get the kid at Chipotle to ruin your burrito with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Angle didn't go to TNA, hear me out... We wouldn't have had to sit through 297 Orton/Cena title matches and PPV main events.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What'd I say last night?  Otis on #SmackDown, Tucker released in 3 months.... erm, I mean, drafted to #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤣🤣🤣 Yo, they just drafted an entire 8 month storyline to #SmackDown so they can run for another 8 months. I'm dead AF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsvedatime Worse than mustard? I guess Tankard never had guac, tartar sauce, a mouthful of Worstecshire... there's lots<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone see Naomi joining MVP and the Hurt Business on #WWERaw so she can deal with Mia Yim while they deal with the men of #RETRIBUTION?  https://t.co/5HSfUsDNYz<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jeremy8911 I don't think it's a choice, is it?   Smackdown should have Mickie though, for sure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@blainesmithy1 @InnerN3rd Everyone complained that every match should be in the HIAC like TNA did Lockdown... now 3 HIAC matches are too much?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AJ Styles vs Drew McIntyre Big E vs Roman Reigns @BiancaBelairWWE  vs anyone on #SmackDown   Yeah, I'm excited... and it was only night one of the #WWEDraft<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SPOILER: You're getting The Fiend in a match for the first time ever on #SmackDown because that dude is getting drafted to #RAW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Adam Pearce should have come out at the start and told Stephanie that USA requested that he make their picks for them. I dunno. I miss having two people go at each other for their draft picks. #SmackDown  #WWEDraft<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is everyone acting like this wasn't 8 months of building Sasha vs Bayley inside the #WWEHIAC?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They only drafted Otis... is Tucker being released in 3 months?  Yup #SmackDown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeremy8911 Called that the minute Bianca Belair was drafted to Smackdown!  Should be good. Wonder if they'll start using BLUE solo cups!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Round 4 of the #WWEDraft  #WWERAW: Kofi and Woods #SMACKDOWN: Big E Raw: Dana Brooke Smackdown: Otis RAW: Angel Garza  Dana Brooke?  Wow, what a pick! *eye roll*  Sad to see New Day break up but I'm psyched for a Big E main event push!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@podcast_uf That's smark booking.  We know Vince doesn't go for the things we want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hell yeah Bayley! Work smart, not hard... not that Sasha is hard for you. She's overrated!  #SmackDown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Round 3 of the #WWEDraft  #WWERaw: Ricochet #Smackdown: Jey Uso RAW: Mandy Rose SD: Dominik and Rey RAW: Miz and Morrison  I guess we'll get Seth/Mysterios for another 8 months. RAW lost round 3 cause they aren't doin much with Ricochet or Rose<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LAAAAARSSSS!!!!  OMG!  #Smackdown    Lars is gonna kill you.... Lars is gonna kill you...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just remember, they like to keep couples together, even though it might not matter with COVID... Bianca to #Smackdown, Street Profits will follow.  Naomi to #WWERaw, The Usos will follow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ROUND 1 and 2 of the #WWEDraft  #WWERAW: McIntyre #Smackdown: Reigns  RAW: Asuka  SD: Rollins  RAW: Hurt Business RAW: AJ Styles SD: Sasha Banks RAW: Naomi SD: Bianca Belair RAW: Baszler/Jax<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SalamanderEXB He seemed a lot less pleased when they started talking about tag teaming again. I can see him walking away/turning. Maybe even getting drafted to #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It could be because of the match he just had, but I feel like the way Big E was acting was a set-up for getting drafted away to be a singles star. #Smackdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeremy8911 Nah, they'll do the cross brand for a few weeks. Murphy will stalk Seth on #Smackdown and get a match with him at HIAC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hundreds of people are going to show up tomorrow and hope that their savior @realDonaldTrump blesses them with the COVID. #COVIDIOTS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TRKG12 Nah, The Tribal Chief won't let that be a thing. There's only one head seat at the table and it's @WWERomanReigns<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Monday Night Messiah was drafted to #Smackdown. You can refer to him as the Friday Night Fraud. There's no messiah, just a Tribal Chief.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPBITW9 I felt for sure Drew would go to SD and Orton would bring the title back to RAW at #WWEHIAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I knew it!  I knew Seth was going to Smackdown!  Hell yeah!  #WWERAW: Drew #Smackdown: Reigns RAW: Asuka SD: Seth Rollins RAW: All 4 members of the Hurt Business<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HERE COMES THE DRAFT!!! #Smackdown  Randy Orton or Drew, 1st draft pick?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeremy8911 Minus the entrance music, I did this so far. They'll win the tag titles at the next Takeover.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayAlletto So he's just going to buy Fox News?  I can see that...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@itsvedatime You can't compromise the taste of the mustard with a pretzel and call it an honest review.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayAlletto No doubt about that man! I'm so over this. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayAlletto DeSantis is letting the Dolphins go max capacity (65,000), if they can, at their next home game, then cutting it back down to like 15% for Oct. 25, if we want the real story.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FiteTV  https://t.co/xxCP15R52r<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yikes. Ricochet really stumbled through that mic spot. #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 So over it. I get it though... they're just buying time until the draft, but this has been going on with Team Apollo and Hurt Business since practically after the Royal Rumble. #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congrats R-Truth. You're the infinity time 24/7 champion.... now throw it in a river or something. We over this schtick. #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love the Bianca BelAir promos. You never see them hype up a woman with vignettes that aren't the lame "I'm sexy and blonde" bullshit. #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you finally realize why Braun vs Lee looks so familiar on #WWERAW     https://t.co/UTGuIt7T4A<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Braun vs Keith Lee?!   #BASKINHISGLORY! What a random pairing, but should be good. I feel like Braun will get the draft to #WWERaw to keep going with #RAWUnderground<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>KO vs The Fiend?  Hell yeah! Super excited to see old heel Kevin Owens back! #WWERaw #KOShow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If @WWERollins gets drafted from #WWERaw will he become the Friday Night Friar on #SmackDown ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayAlletto "Rattled"  Yeah, Vince is real rattled by a promo from a guy who got legit injured in his FIRST MATCH.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone thinks The Gargano Way has failed... I'm just sittin' here like "They shouldn't be drafted to #Smackdown with WWENXT titles."  Their gimmick is going to be over AF on the Blue Brand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vince, every time he sends Nia Jax out to put Lana through a table(every.single.week.) on #WWERaw:   #VinceBury  https://t.co/2dlf8ZRhlm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Might not have been the announce table, but that's how many weeks in a row that Lana got wrecked?  Oh wait, here comes the announce table for Lana. #WWERaw<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SPBITW9 Vince,20 minutes before #WWERaw :  https://t.co/9kUU4q2cyi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why trade Mandy to #WWERaw so close to the draft like they did? Because Vince messed up with Otis/#MITB and wanted to get Mandy away from him cause he's high on her. #BOOM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPBITW9 Like RVD.... super fucking HIGH!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is #WWERaw seriously kicking off with Natalya? Hmmm, I wonder what else is on TV tonight...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/rukOlbwZZp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Her: Who hurt you so bad?   Me: Girl, we better order some dessert cause this gonna take a while!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WN_Net 327 of them with no defense... fucking lame.   Not her fault, but stop with "longest" anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWEEmberMoon Whoever wanted Bo back is lame. You're the highlight of the night!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthWagler Sorry you feel that way after bringing up someone's weight/size. Growing up is a good option too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Totally see a Ciampa/Gargano turn happening tonight.   KOR loses, Cole hugs him. The copyright pops up on the screen,  Cole attacks... #NXTTakeOver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so happy about this. My two favorite things... Halloween and Shotzi!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeremy8911 Who wants Bo? That guy sucks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't forget,  when Fish and Strong were warning up with Kyle,  Cole was sitting there and watching with disdain on his face... the turn is coming. KOR is about to be the top face of NXT, title or not. #NXTTakeOver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lythas5 Agreed.  I'm glad she's back though. Let Candice and Shotzi get drafted up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Screw Toni Storm... totally took away from Ember's return. #NXTTakeOver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lythas5 @WWEEmberMoon I will geek out like a mofo! I love Ember as a person, a wrestler, a woman... she's bae! Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll say Io wins but it doesn't matter... bell rings,  10.4.20 promo plays,  @WWEEmberMoon comes out.   Hell Yes! #NXTTakeOver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wrestling_Memes My dude, let's just shut up and enjoy Kushida wrecking that pos Velveteen! #nxttakeover<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love @ArcherOfInfamy but I also hope this means Gargano and Candice will be drafted to carry their married couple story to Smackdown! #NXTTakeOver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wrestling_Memes Beth had been commentary for MONTHS from home,  Mauro was too... watch the weekly show and come back to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lythas5 @TripleH They'll eat shit in 2 weeks when there's another outbreak in NXT... oi vey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wrestling_Memes Can't make memes if you don't watch the shows.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wrestling_Memes You don't even watch... ok.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How long until Candice comes to help Gargano... then he helps her?   It's the evolution of their storyline right now. Sorry Priest and Io.  #nxttakeover<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 I'd laugh react that if I could. One of my favorite movies! Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's be honest... if Gargano wins the NA Title,  Candice will win the woman's title.  #nxttakeover<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPBITW9 Good point, but I heard a month ago that they're trying to get fans into shows come November, plus they could do it on Sat. before SurvSer at the Amway center... it'll be interesting to see, for sure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPBITW9 I thought the same, but I also think they will put UE in #NXTWarGames next month, so they might just wait on the turn...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It doesn't matter how many times you held the championship, it matters what you did while holding that championship. Finn will go down as the best NXT Champion ever!  #NXTTakeover<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 I expect a clean finish, but the way Adam Cole is so vocal to back him makes me feel like something is up... maybe not tonight, but in the next few weeks UE turns on him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@olivernorgrove @JayAlletto @nyc1219 @TLDWrestling @brianhwaters @TophKnowsBest @EronTalks @FManzo3 @ZakFellows @bpritchard152 @ChiefJosheola @ffsford This guy's gonna be the PM of Britain and we're gonna be like "that's one half of Fatty &amp; Twatty"  LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 Adam Cole turn?  UE costs him the match?   I hope not. Finn needs legit wins for a while with that title.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayAlletto What's crazy is that @TophKnowsBest is one of the hits I look forward to seeing offer his opinion on fb. We grow, we learn, no time for bullshit or hate anymore.... cause I fucking HATED him for the longest time!  Haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EronTalks @JayAlletto @nyc1219 @TLDWrestling @brianhwaters @TophKnowsBest @FManzo3 @ZakFellows @bpritchard152 @ChiefJosheola @olivernorgrove @ffsford 100! I even became friends with Toph because of PWP and wrestling!! Y'all are great peeps, for sure!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ducky138 I'm a big dude. It took a long time to accept and be happy with me even if it seems rough during times of depression/bipolar.  I also prefer bigger women, but I hate when they feel like that need to hate themselves for their size...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 I bet it would smell like rum and the beach... maybe a hint of gold scent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ducky138 Wait what? That's a thing?! Fuck fat shaming. I'ma lose some weight because as I get older I can feel my old injuries aching, but i'm fine never being 200lbs with abs. F them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 I thought that said "deodorant for PIRATES" and I was all in until I read it again...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoonTimeDweller @GratefulDead @TheJimCornette @GreatBrianLast Nah, it came from prisoners calling the correction officers "boss" or "boss man"... but you make a great point. Hmmm maybe Vince loved Garcia.  Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 #NXTTakeOver is enough to make any feel better!!!  WOOHOO!!  This Capitol Center I'm hearing about just has me more excited!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just realized today that I NEVER buy Doritos and couldn't care less.... but I'm gonna fist fight Taco Bell the day they discontinue the Doritos tacos.  'member that @tacobell!!!  https://t.co/NCWDPKblyx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@applesause90 But them Doritos Tacos though... hell to the yea!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Trump out there making the debate look like my parents arguing before they got a divorce.  What a big stupid asshole...#Debates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LOL this guy is like a child... Trump is more immature than my roommate's 10yo. Christ.  #Debates2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 OMG... I'm absurdly excited for the draft! LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>KLR is great, but I guess I'm a typical guy... Piper is super attractive and I want her to win everything....  Bigger is better, not afraid to admit that. She is ungodly talented either way tho.... #NXTUK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 Great stuff, rematches aside... there's some BIG stories/swerves about to happen with the draft!!! Wish I was lookin like Roode tho!! LOL, He's a godsend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealMickFoley More worried about BIG TIME swing state Pennsylvania... tired of these Murica Rednecks.... Lova ya Mick, but ther'es bigger things right now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GLORIOUS  So happy to see Roode back! I hope he gets a main event push after the draft.... #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lythas5 I saw that...  Ever see Big E's "I love 5" promo? GARBAGE!!! I'm shocked he was called up, but I love that he bloomed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MFImJordan Bro... do yourself that favor. I got bored and watched the first episode two months ago and have binge watched it twice from start to finish. Dan Harmon is a GOD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ya'll acting like heel Roman is a godsend... dude was a heel in FCW and it was amazing. He needed this, just like Orton needed a heel turn.  #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MFImJordan Ah, I was hoping you'd catch the quote from Community.... All in all, I agree with you. Abed would not. LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPBITW9 I wish I could laugh react that, cause it's funny and you right about that!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MFImJordan Ever seen Hearts of Darkness? Way better than Apocalypse Now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPBITW9 Careful... they might Hurt you... Business is good after all! #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeremy8911 Dats cool.  Great reason to bring back Roode... but if they change his music, it's pointless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPBITW9 Underground will survive.... RIP BRAUN is more the conversation tonight... #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone in DC hides stuff. They pretend they're on our side but after 20-40 years, they just want the money.  Change begins at the local level. Mayors, Governors, State house. Don't get discouraged that a 3rd party doesn't matter in this election. Start from the ground up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPBITW9 You realized it after I mentioned it... LOL  ;)  They use a lot of NXT/PC guys so I'm not overly shocked they had to cut Underground tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ya'll mad about a 31yo and 19yo on #WWERaw and don't even know about HHH drugging Steph and marrying her when she was unconscious on RAW.  It's all fake. Grow up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealPaigeWWE They all sound that way... Haters sound like off-air white snow to me when they try to hate on what I've done... Just be you. No one will ever take that away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did #RawUnderground get shut down for 2 weeks too? No promo, no video, no package... and it's almost 10pm.  Man, COVID sucks balls. #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess this make R-Truth the 103 time 24/7 champion with only ONE real match in the ring... Dats cool  #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yo, @VinceMcMahon, stop changing those badass CFO$ themes.  Keith Lee, Aleister Black... Stop worrying about those pennies on the theme when these guys are bringing you the Benjis! #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13  https://t.co/N2X3qmHWps<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love that Black uses the head wrap instead of an eye patch... looks a lot more like his character, and his being. An eye patch would be a sin for him. #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yo, say what you want... Rose, Dana, Natty, Lana, Royce, Kaye....   Vince is slowly bringing back the Divas.... #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WN_Net Fuck... is Sling TV that far behind? I saw that tweet in the middle of the match!!! lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lythas5 What? I love the chub! Don't you judge me my brotha!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharlotteEmpire Nah, you had the problem... Dats cool...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lythas5 I need to see HUGE improvement from Dana... her looks, which were better 30lbs ago, won't get her through...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ya'll mad that there's a FAKE story of a 31yo man and a 19yo woman and it's weird and gross.... but a 35yo woman trying to marry an 87yo man or his money... Dats cool.  #DoubleStandards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That just blew my mind! #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharlotteEmpire He's like 31.... what's your issue? It's not like he's 37 and grooming a 15 year old... PLUS, it's FAKE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharlotteEmpire She's 19, soooo......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE @NatbyNature @LanaWWE Nope. Natalya has zero charisma, just like Uncle Bret, and Lana is just going to get put through hell because of Miro. I'm out for 20 minutes. #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know where this story is really going to go, but I really want Rollins vs Murphy!  5 Star Match... #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lythas5 Do it!  Someone tried to tell me that Vega deserves better. Like, zero RAW matches, a title match, another title match... Unfollowed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ladies and Gentlemen.... R-TRUTH!  The 97 time 24/7 champion who has never actually been in a match!!!  #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lythas5 It's weird that they embrace her lack of English, but ignore Shinsuke's... but yet the Samoan who can speak English was given Jim Cornette to be his mouthpiece at various points in his run...  #StupidVince<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPBITW9 I pray to God this is a set up for JBL and Farrooq to show up. #DAMN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lythas5 I'd agree, only because Yokozuna wasn't actually Japanese... I love Io since her heel turn in NXT, but she won't compare to Asuka if/when she comes up. Shinsuke could have been, but they dropped that ball because he doesn't speak English well enough. Stupid Vince<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lythas5 It took me a while to warm up to her, but damn... she really is the BEST in the world and I just keep enjoying her more and more each week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jeff Daniels is trending and, working with the news, I thought the absolute worst and almost screamed...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IMO, Asuka is the opposite of the "Call-up Curse"  I liked her in NXT, but since coming to the main roster, I've just enjoyed her more and more, and she's hands down my favorite lately. Sorry Bayley.... #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is how they change titles... Randy gets drafted to Smackdown but still gets his HIAC match against Drew, then wins. Meanwhile Reigns is already drafted to RAW and running roughshod on everyone.  Reigns/McIntrye. hell yeah. #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big Show, HBK, Christian, and Flair walk to the ring...  There's no punchline. It's 2020 and that just happened. I feel like I'm watching a TNA reboot of Main Event Mafia. #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayAlletto Not a huge fan, but for real... I mean, Velveteen Dream is back, Matt Riddle hasn't seen any kind of backlash... Yet Tessa is getting all the hate.   Cause she's a woman, point blank. Fans are pissed she held the Impact Championship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Asx8519 That's gonna be epic!! I can't wait...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"No one is ready for ASUKAAAAAA..."  *Ember Moon's music hits*   For real though, WTH happened with Moon?  I loved her!  #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WN_Net @predictor_pro I feel ya. I'm a do as I say, not as I do kinda guy so I'd be all up on someone too. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man, @WN_Net is saying that Retribution will miss two weeks of #WWERaw   Obviously COVID, but shit, that takes out Keith Lee too because if Mia was exposed, so is he. Poor #SlapJack<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WN_Net @predictor_pro Dude's got 105... not even worth the headache bro bro.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can I... But...  Can you just put these two inside HIAC already?!  (Won't even happen at HIAC either. Shame) #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HeelWillMahoney Between MNF and the 1st Debate, RAW is gonna feel the REAL Hurt Business...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tonight on #WWERaw   Asuka vs Vega Lee finally wants a fair fight with Drew.  Let's see...Garza got hurt so, Andrade vs 1 of the SP Seth vs Dominik in some form.   Should be decent. Can't wait for the draft.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nekrosangelo Niiice! I gotta find a stream too so I can watch #WWERAW on my telly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nekrosangelo Yup!  I was just talking to Crazy Donnie about how absurdly hilarious this is going to be.  I'm gonna drunk tweet it and then uncontrollably weep for this country. #murica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Xpinite It aged fine until Big Show had to stick his nose into their business. Same with Christian and HBOld guy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This guy keeps changing the layout of the Excel document and it's pissing me off...  Today is not a day I am to be trifled with!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeremy8911 I was just thinking that last night while watching his Day Of after Clash.  HELL. YES!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsvedatime April 29th, 2015. I called my best friend from Orlando FL, drunk, walking the city and telling him my plan to be Kingpin and turn the city into my criminal empire. He still doesn't let me live that down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeremy8911 I pray to God he sports BOTH titles until he drops it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeremy8911 Yo, Fuck Boris... fitting name though cause he out here trying to Bore us<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeremy8911 I'd buy a Reigns shirt that had the print of a flower lei from the shoulders around the collar... maybe "TRIBAL CHIEF" on the back with his RR symbol.. hmmm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saw the SVU episode with Stabler's daughter and mother being bipolar, great episode... but there's one line that hits me hard:  "I lived the life I wanted to live, and I paid dearly for it"  People bounce back, but I've paid dearly for my unchecked bipolar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know who booked tonight's matches, but jesus... this is THE BEST PPV of the year!  Uce could do it!!!  #WWEClash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The joke's on Roman Reigns... that's Jimmy Uso. Jey gonna come out and catch him off guard and take that title in 7 minutes. #WWEClash #UniversalTitle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn. Only took 6 years to drop the Shield vest like the other two did... #WWEClash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimmsGetzIt I wrestled with my cousin all the time. Now he's in jail and I'm sitting here eating Ramen noodles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thdeadlysin I'll pretend Bayley and The Riott Squad would have won their matches to help boost my numbers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thdeadlysin Those damn legends ruined my whole prediction card... *le sigh*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOOOOOO!  As Orton was about to close the doors on Drew, THAT was when I expected to see Ric Flair show and low blow Orton from behind... that whole match was AMAZING storytelling. Bravo. #WWEClash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THAT WAS AWESOME! *clap clap clapclapclap* The Legends helped Drew kill the Legend Killer.. poetic justice #WWEClash #AmbulanceMatch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alright, I'll say it... This is the match of the night, no doubt. #AmbulanceMatch #WWEClash ... what a great PPV all around though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YES!  It's happening!!!! Thank you, Christian! #CaptainCharisma #WWEClash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SalamanderEXB The only 7 foot tall, bald, 450lb man that's been working with all of them for over 20 years. Yeah, no idea who that is... #WWEClash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big Show?!  Oh shit!  Can you imagine if Edge, Christian, HBK AND Ric Flair all show up too?! #WWEClash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yo... The Miz can't sue Otis for the briefcase if Otis already used the briefcase...even if it's a failed cash in. #WWEClash  https://t.co/MogEMiGEkC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel safe in saying this match will be hard-hitting and brutal. Blood? More than likely. I got Randy on this one. #WWEClash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unpopular Opinion: Sasha Banks is overrated garbage... Don't @ me. She's the queen of YUCKSVILLE, population: 1.  #WWEClash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sasha is the worst lol... #WWEClash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Asuka All Belts about to leave #WWEClash with both Woman's Championships!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh my god!  I never thought I'd love Asuka so much... these past few months have been amazing! #WWEClash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Enter Sasha... #WWEClash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FiteTV  https://t.co/bHiiPXFT1s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every champion?  I'm betting my paycheck they switch the US and IC titles.  #WWEClash   Question: if you can draft a team, can you draft all 4 of the Hurt Business?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the hell is going on? This is the 3rd match with a fuckery finish in September. Two of which from legit injuries(Ivar, now possibly Garza)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Andrade totally kicked out... now we get this match another 12 times in October. #WWEClash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InnerN3rd Another injury? Hmmm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SP win... Hurt Business(Benjamin/Cedric) take that gold soon, then Retribution takes them.  #WWEClash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"HOLY SHIT!"  Ford and Garza both almost died tonight. #WWEClash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey!  4 for 4!  It's not a shocker though. You could tell this was a 99% throw away. Vega, Uso, Lucha... they're not taking titles tonight. uh-duh  #WWEClash  Good matches though, for real<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's #WWEClash AND Taco Bell accidentally gave me 4 burritos when I only ordered two... #TacoBellBreakfast #BestNightEver<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SimmsGetzIt Shit, my bad fam. I'll get it right next time! Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cedric's absence is strange... but in 2020 it's probably just COVID.  #WWEClash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Richest president?  Nah, #TrumpIsBroke #WelcomeToWelfare<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welp, 3 for 3 so far! #WWEClash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice match, but we all know Asuka is keeping that title until Charlotte comes back.  #WWEClash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We all know Truth will get that 24/7 title back. They keep it on RAW because that's what USA Network wants.... #WWEClash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FUCKING LEGEND!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vince out here trying to erase COVID from the WWE... Zayn left Mania with the IC title, has it back. Reigns was supposed to leave Mania with the Universal Title, he has it now...Braun being misused before Mania, he's being misused now. #WWEClash<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Through the ear!!!  Sami is  genius!!!  #WWEClash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Thunderdome won't be 100% legit until WWE feeds ins "Holy Shit! Holy Shit! Holy Shit!" chants. #WWEClash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG!  Did you expect anything else from Jeff Hardy?!  #HolyShit! #WWEClash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thdeadlysin Oh yeah, their network deals and deals with Hulu won't allow them to upload anything for 30 days... give it a few years, they'll work around it. lo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you have to pull two matches from the card, then you should give AJ/Hardy/Zayn all that time... an hour of this ladder match? Yes please!  #WWEClash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thdeadlysin FOX*  But I don't have cable... I'll watch it on Hulu over the weekend. She keeps spacing out like a zombie and hitting sister Abagail on peeps if someone mentions The Fiend. Wild stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Face it: No matter who wins this match, WE are the winners!  Spoiler: Zayn uses some shady shit to steal that title and "retain" his IC Title.  #WWEClash #GoZaynGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thdeadlysin I could see that with ease, but I just know Vince is salivating over those two for the title and he'd have Bliss go freaky and get a DQ so Bayley kept the gold...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm glad Cesaro and Shinsuke won for two reasons, 1. I love those guys and they deserve it.  2. NO ONE wants to see the Lucha House Party any more than they already have. Can we split them up already?  #WWEClash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeremy8911 They're RAW, she's Smackdown... can't rock the boat with a draft coming up. God forbid! lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whoa! You gon start the show with the easy match of the Night?!  I can dig that.... suckaaaaaa! #WWEClash #ICLadderMatch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thdeadlysin Yeah, if there's zero reason, it has to be COVID... shame. I really wanted to see Nikki and Bayley and if they do more with this Bliss/Fiend angle during it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeepSleepaveli MUST SEE TV!  It's better than watching an eclipse in the midst of a heat wave!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thdeadlysin Wait, what?  Why? Did Nia hurt someone again?! God, I really hate the E sometimes...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeremy8911 His first live entrance, at Takeover, will always be one of my favorites! I can't' wait until fans are there again to sing along!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thdeadlysin I was hoping so... I also wouldn't be surprised to see Vince try to cram both matches into what's left of the pre-show.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPBITW9 I hope so. I wouldn't put it past Vince to cram both matches into the next 22 minutes #WWEClash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, did they move Asuka/Vega to the main show. or are they going to cram two title matches into 23 minutes of pre-show?  #WWEClash<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZacharyQuinto Angela.  https://t.co/m2Bl3grmqZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayAlletto I get it though. I don't need Matt Damon to show up every four years like we give a fuck about his stance. I just don't bitch about it like I've watched some do over The Rock, like holy hell man. Dude was almost crying cause he "HAD TO" unfollow The Rock. LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayAlletto I refuse to believe people like that that AREN'T white don't give a fuck... But hey, they have MILLIONS, what's going on, systemic racism, fascism... nothing should matter to them though, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenMoor38000784 @Jeremy8911 You don't like Trump but you're sounding and acting a lot like him... Dats cool... #eyeroll<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayAlletto Or they're all just... not idiots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonMotta  https://t.co/sDexYGuthI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where's the other Uso twin?   Anyone feel a little surprise/twin magic being planned, or is Jimmy on injury?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michel50 @thehill Vote Trump to save America... from Trump?   Makes no God damn sense. This disaster he says will be Biden's America is already his America... don't be a sheep...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill @kenjeong I find it hilarious that people think Trump signs mean he's winning... people not voting for him don't feel the need to be annoying cunts and put 8 signs and 2 flags in their yard. Think about that the next time you see 5 out of 100 houses with Trump signs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@USA_Network @nbcsvu Y'all out here playing SVU like Tru plays the Jokers... and I couldn't be happier!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alfie_hulse @IAM_THE_GENIUS @WWE Just gonna stick to all the old E guys fighting over AEW titles huh? Dats cool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DMX out there looking like Blade's uncle, Steak Knife...  #SteakKnifeGonGiveItToYa  https://t.co/1Ckdejza7x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meltzer: Keith Lee is set to be added and win the WWE championship tonight.   *doesn't happen*  Meltzer: oh, Vince changed his mind during the show. I definitely didn't report on Lee just to get clicks...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haseeb20_ @IAM_THE_GENIUS @WWE He does.. the sadistic heel Orton is always the best Orton!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This sode is gonna be da 💣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IAM_THE_GENIUS @WWE Looking like no one has faith in Drew tonight... Keith Lee heel turn? I dunno.  Orton is definitely leaving with that strap tonight though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrestleJoy If they're not into wrestling, they won't care about the technical genius of his like Hart, Benoit, Malenko etc...  I'd go with HBK/Taker at 25, or Foley/HHH RR Street Fight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I bet we could have gotten the show live from Building II on the Network by now... @DeepSleepaveli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JordiSpeaks Oh for sure. Those three in any match against another of those three is going to be great... all three in a ladder match? Oh Lawdy!  Interested to see if Keith gets added to the title match and they scrap the Ambulance match stip...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The President downplayed COVID-19 to the point that his sheep think it's #fakenews and are piling into High School football games like it's 2019, and we're all going to keep DYING.  Cool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 That's amazing!  #Burn  https://t.co/tZHRKqSFAc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When @RealKeithLee finally gets his hands on T-Bar and retribution for wrecking his matches with Drew... #WWEClash  https://t.co/cT5H9QQyxb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What if it was all a set-up? What if It was all an act to help Apollo get the U.S. Title back?  What if Cedric turns on the Hurt Business tonight.  I'll cry. Cedric needs this to keep going as it's going. #WWEClash #BusinessIsGood<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JordiSpeaks Looking forward to it ALL... almost as much as next week's NXT Takeover!  Drew/Orton will be 🔥🔥🔥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree with a lot of these. Riott Squad is more of a brand to brand team. Nia and Shayna don't need to go to Smackdown or NXT. I do really feel like Orton/Drew will be the ONLY title change if you don't count the IC match that I think Sami wins<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KentSinkler @Shinedown @SmithAndMyers Yeah, just being a troll I guess cause I think Eilish is pure garbage, but based on the Grammys... I don't know what the hell I'm talking about. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InnerN3rd Slap Jack... it's just so bad!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KentSinkler @Shinedown @SmithAndMyers Ooohhh really?  https://t.co/bsPVvxCdUa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InnerN3rd  https://t.co/0fXhfHsaFi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveVescio Same people. Won't wear a mask either...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@popculturewres1 1. Keith Lee 2. Bayley 3. Cameron Grimes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Billie Eilish is fucking garbage.   Don't @ me. You're wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shinedown @SmithAndMyers BAD GUY?  Wow... No thanks. Can I get the album without that shit?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InnerN3rd Eh, Peyton's match with Billie and then last week with Asuka made me really cringe and feel like Kelly Kelly was going to return and bring back the DIVAS era. I hope Royce actually steps up soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People ARE weird, man maaaaan  https://t.co/ZazJBfAKta<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayAlletto Never gonna happen with those two. They're still throwing a pissy bitch fit over him posting a picture of Keith Lee beating Adam Cole for the title at the NXT tapings.  100% cool if Bivens shows up to lead Retribution tho!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@King_Smoove757 @JayAlletto For sure. When they wrecked the entire woman's division to put the 4 Horsewomen on the main roster and change from Divas... I think they stole half of their writers, agents, etc.. too from NXT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@x_Beast17_x James fucking Ellsworth...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayAlletto No different than when Main Roster would gut NXT after Mania, It's a weird time, but they'll rebuild again and again. Not bad last night, but far from great.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#WWENXT was good last night... not the best show they've had, but not bad. Excited to see who they continue to build up.  Losing Lee, Kross, Dijak, and seemingly Cole at this point is tough, but they'll rebuild just like they always do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was it just me, or was that ending extremely anti-climactic?  Good for KOR tho. I'm excited! #wwenxt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@x_Beast17_x Careful... you're gonna make the IWC cry themselves to sleep tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't be the only one who absolutely loves @CGrimesWWE right? Then again, I think I'm the only one who wants to turn Thatcher off...  #wwenxt #GauntletEliminator<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 I'm going with Grimes... maybe Thatcher. Blah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tylermay_1 Oh yeah, 100 freaking percent... the twist will be when she costs Johnny his match too. Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>See, what had happened was...  Ciampa took the cool mask. @SlapJackRTRBTN had to take what was left when he walked into party city.   #RETRIBUTION #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tylermay_1 Oh... well that sounds exactly like a wwe move...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God bless this dude... he's trying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait... did I miss Tegan Nox or was she not in the battle royal after all?   #WWENXT #battleroyal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@prowrestlingmag She married a citizen... she's a dual citizen... That's how America works guy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shawn Spears is good, but the "perfect 10" gimmick made him... He's mid-card at best with AEW.... but I still enjoy his matches. #AEWLateNightDynamite<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Roman Reigns Superman Punch: "WE HATE ROMAN!"  Orange Cassidy with the same move: "OMG! ORANGE IS AMAZING!!!!"  Just be a fan. #JustBeAFan #DirtSheetsRuinedUs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@prowrestlingmag Nothing like stretching for clicks...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ringsidenews_ @prowrestlingmag Oh snap! Found it! This is great!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ringsidenews_ @prowrestlingmag waaaa??? how do I watch? is it still on?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@applesause90 "I need dimes so I can feed my pigs"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlueRiott I don't think Main Roster, even at Mania, has ever outperformed a TakeOver show that same weekend. Trips knows what he's doing, 100%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlueRiott Yeah, I went to Full Sail for 8 months and was hoping to intern with NXT, but let me tell you, being in that Takeover crowd was amazing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fun Fact: I still bitch about my ex-wife not letting me attend a TNA Impact taping in Orlando when we were there on vacation.  She was jealous because I loved wrestling more than her... she also sucked, soooo...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlueRiott Would be badass, but sadly, Mania is still on my bucket list. lol  Thankfully I got to be at Full Sail when Sasha won the title in the 4-way and Kevin Owens won the NXT title from Zayn at Takeover.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 Being bipolar, I feel ya. I know nights like this all too well... thankfully I've been able to tell myself it will pass and everything will seem ok again.  GL, Big hugs &amp; high fives!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlueRiott Hopefully, when the time is right!  My last indy show before COVID had Daniels on it and I was geeking the hell out. One of my all-time faves, for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlueRiott YAAAS!  There was a point in time that Addiction(and Austin Aries) were the ONLY reason I would watch TNA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlueRiott Oh man, if Mox and Rollins had one last blow out, but dirt sheets reported they were leaving... nah, horrible comparison. those guys can actually work and deserve praise either way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@INVICTUSProWre1 @greekgodpapadon @WreckingBall75 @NickStappOkay @ManOfSteelMV @Mattyvides @AnaMorningstarr @bambamthebelly @BigGameLeroy @WarriorBonez @NotDMorgan Yo! Is that the Greek God Papadon?! I'd be there just for him if I could!!  Good luck to all of ya! #IndyWrestling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlueRiott Their Mania 20 match? It was the first time I can ever remember an entire arena hating on a match, and it changed the landscape because the Dirt Sheets leaked out they both men were leaving WWE after that match. SO MUCH HATE!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #Impactin60 and it's all EC3 so, FAN THEORY:  EC3 failed on the E main roster because Vince was mad that he was still EC3, a name that WWE couldn't take, copyright, and own... just like he buried so many WCW guys that weren't his.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlueRiott No one will ever be as disappointed as we were with Lesnar/Goldberg at 'Mania 20.... or, well, recently either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SOUND OFF: You're having the last BBQ of the summer.  What's on your burger? Any and every topping, dressing, etc... available.  Me? Honey BBQ, Colby Jack Cheese, Mayo, Lettuce, fried Pickles, Chili, and a slice of white american on the bottom bun<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lythas5 Oh for sure! I was excited when I started watching Impact when it came to AXSTv, but I legit feel like turning when we get this RVD.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Caleb with a K is a doucher... but as long as Dashwood doesn't try dancing and popping bubbles, I'll stick around for the main.  #ImpactWrestling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Forbes freaks me out. Everything about her is fake... ass, tits, ABS...  Sad really... gotta learn to love who you are, not what you think people want to see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveVescio Working in local media, we don't. We report what he says/does, but the stuff is so stupid and absurd, and a lot of lies, that all his supporters claim we are biased... he will 100% go down as one of the worst in presidential history.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@applesause90 Absolutely @MontezFordWWE... 100% man. That guy is MONEY 🔥🔥🔥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Posting again because #heath4impact isn't trending yet.  lets go boys and girls!!  Do the right thing @IMPACTWRESTLING   #IMPACTonAXSTV #ImpactWrestling<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BillNeville87 Gushers.  I was so psyched when they put them in the vending machine at work a few months ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayAlletto Agreed. I had flashbacks of The Great Khali's debut... yikes!  Kato has years of RAW ahead of him. No need to ever put him in the ring until this world gets back to normal and they can protect him while he learns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiscussingFilm SIX SEASONS AND A MOVIE!  #sixseasonsandamovie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharlotteEmpire See-ya Twizz. It was a good run.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While everyone's going to complain about Mysterio's daughter and Murphy, I'm gonna be watching Impractical Jokers and then @IMPACTWRESTLING in 2 1/2 hours.  Maybe shut the fuck up and just be a fan for a while.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWEREALONE That's what I watch NXT and Impact for. K Thnx Bye<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When they tried to tell Dio Madden that his name was "Slap Jack" at first.... #WWERAW #RETRIBUTION  https://t.co/VZFmEoIpa0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The year is 2024. Shane Thorne has been released.  He tells Chris Jericho that no one told him his #RETRIBUTION name, "Slap Jack"... Jericho laughs before calling Vince a perpetual child.  We all laugh and agree as Talk is Jericho continues...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PettiESTBoss This has an R-Truth segment written all over it...  AND NEW 24/7 Champion...SLAPJACK!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can you imagine standing at catering and someone comes up and tells you your new name is "slapjack"? Shit's worse than "Husky Harris" yo  #WWERaw #RAW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeremy8911 I'd rather watch Aces &amp; Eights again...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Poor Braun... dude's about to get those hands.  #WWERaw #RAW #RawUnderground<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ive said it before, I'll say it again, and I'll keep saying it...  Heel Rollins is the BEST Rollins!  #WWERaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tom Hardy called. He wants his Mad Maxx masks back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So wait, Hurt Business aren't good guys?  No, wait... is #Retribution just that bad?   No, Wait... #wweraw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I said what I said, but I'd rather Mysterio/Humberto face the Street Profits than Andrade/Garza... again.   #wweraw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like Mysterio, but if he takes the tag titles from the Street Profits,  I'm gonna lose it! #wweraw<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 I was really sick last weekend and even missed the first day back in my news station after 6 months, I was negative. My Dr. chalked it up to the regular flu... Then again, I haven't gone anywhere but the grocery store the past 6 months.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@prowrestlingmag I like Otis, and it was an OK move before COVID-19. Otis without the fans in the crowd just isn't the right guy. I'd be fine with Miz taking the case and winding up main eventing either show.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman Kinda like Trump promised to release his tax returns when elected?  K then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With streaming, and the fact that DVR ratings count up to 3 days later, your rating reports between AEW/NXT is futile.  This isn't the 90s. Neither seems concerned at all with ending the other company... let's just be fans!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayAlletto @CGrimesWWE Oh yeah, I split Sling TV with my roommate. $20 a month is so much better than $150(75 each).  This is also why ratings are pointless. Thursday morning ratings of AEW/NXT mean shit without the DVR's Plus 3 ratings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayAlletto That's the problem nowadays. I love Breezango, Escobar, Ciampa, Blackhart, Priest, and especially @CGrimesWWE! I don't need Kross and Lee when they have talent like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayAlletto I never skip NXT. I think I missed a total of 3 episodes since it launched on the Network. lol   Totally forgot all about SD though.... meh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember, Mox wasn't happy and decided to leave. Hardy is happy and decided to stay.  As a fan, it's not your place to decide if someone should leave a company. They could be happy just making money. Happiness is different for everyone. K?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MidnightBashem Christ.... for an intellectual gentleman, you should know that looting, rioting, and destroying property is not protesting... at least not acceptable protesting.  You don't get it, it's cool. no one in Trump's cult does, including him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MidnightBashem Staged... Sorry I even replied. You're just a Trump Sheep. Have a good weekend.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MidnightBashem He could, but his peeps understand a pandemic with actual caution for other humans.  Have a good weekend though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MidnightBashem Whoa! That's a HUGE cult!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sethgutt @SeanyCohens @MajorWFPod Man, I really miss my collection of boxed 90's WWF figures. Bought 115 of them at a flea market for $70. Wife made me sell them for $45.... well, Ex-wife, for obvious reasons.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jeremy8911 Man, I love Bryan, but I just can't get into Thatcher AT ALL. I don't know what it is... He just bores me I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I CANNOT WAIT for #WWENXT this Wednesday!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kushida, Cameron Grime, Kyle O'Reilly  Who else you got?  Ciampa, Thatcher, Gargano, Strong, Bronson Reed, and Dream.... thoughts?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsvedatime  https://t.co/niu3yrDMvO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Carole Baskin killed her husband!"  Cool, ya'll wanna talk about this next?  https://t.co/7qYnNlC6De<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZakFellows I'm excited to see what NXT would do with it though. I'm not making any bets until I see a few of the entrants though, but if Finn is kinda face now, Kushida's new attitude could be his heel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sethgutt @SeanyCohens @MajorWFPod HBK with the "Conceited Crunch"  LOL  I love it man!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you didn't draw this all over your notebooks, did you even go to school?  https://t.co/eVxXxEEuvI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@prowrestlingmag  https://t.co/bt5VSNoRmA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yo... with Kushida entering the Eliminator (and Cameron Grimes) and with his new attitude the past few weeks...  Could we see Finn Balor vs Kushida for the #WWENXT Championship at TakeOver?!  #HELLYEAH!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrokenSpacehog @btsportwwe @IAmJericho Yeah, I always thought it was Goldust and I decided to look up and see what I could find. In a podcast where Jericho talks about Vince hating tournaments, he said he was at HQ and learned it was gonna be Tom Green.  Crazy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you really have nothing to talk about, why are you still talking to them?  #DatingTips<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vince didn't have to keep going for us to have wrestling, to spend millions on the Thunderdome for us.  But at the same time, he's so out of touch. Sadly, the guys doing the writing(and his yes men) are the same ones from 25 years ago 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@btsportwwe Definitely GTV.  (Although @IAmJericho  said in a podcast that it was supposed to be Tom Green until Vince finally saw some of Tom Green's stuff and hated it. GTV died that die.)  https://t.co/JSmEt5L0Xm<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Joke's on that big dumb asshole... I just downloaded Tik Tok before they try to ban that from happening this weekend.  In fact, if nothing else, this "War" he has to have only helped Tik Tok get more downloads. #Idiots<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Been watching old #NXTUK most of the day... Man, I miss that crowd. Those UK fans are on a whole different level! Makes me want to live there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great stuff #NXTUK! I like Noam Dar, but Dragunov is bank!  I can see him getting through Imperium and taking that title from Walter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure how I feel about the empty building(no fans, or Thunderdome) but they're still piping in crowd noise...    #NXTUK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>KLR: "I'm the longest reigning #NXTUK Woman's Champion"  Also KLR: 383-day' reign', minus the shutdown because, well...., 203 Days.  Toni Storm still wins, for now.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 At least #NXTUK is back today!!!  Soon! #HOORAY!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LESS THAN AN HOUR!!!! #NXTUK IS BACK!  Before COVID-19, I was watching more NXTUK than I was watching Main Roster, for real<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeremy8911 I'm so used to using FB that I spent 5 minutes trying to laugh react to this guy.  Wow... what a crazy world 2020 is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stupid workers using the jackhammer at 7am... Stupid work... Stupid meeting...    THANK GOD for the return of #WWENXTUK! I hope Imperium and Gallus are there. Andrews and Webster are a must. #NXTUK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 I always have low hopes when a team is just thrown together, but Kasey &amp; Carter were awesome!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InnerN3rd Good stuff! Wasn't sure I wanted to watch 3 tag matches all crammed into the middle of the show, but everything was just really fun to watch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 I die every time I watch this episode, or even just this scene.  You're Welcome. lol   https://t.co/j3rDV9fB34<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kat_woman13 Indeed! I was worried when I realized there were three tag matches crammed into the show, but everything was just really fun to watch this week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeremy8911 Who, Punishment?  Nah, I've always enjoyed what he's been doing, for sure!  Loving him in NXT the most though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InnerN3rd Great! I loved when Priest retained his title...  I may have been on the wrong channel. *shrugs*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thatcher out here looking like he's about to give Priest a poisoned apple... #WWENXT #NXTNATitle  https://t.co/B6TwSmzxlL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah I'll say it:  I'm gonna be BIG MAD if Priest loses that North American Championship to Thatcher. #WWENXT #LiveInInfamy #ArcherofInfamy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hardcore_Fan101 And... Ciampa is heel while Killian Dain is face?  2020 is gettin' WEIRD now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Roderick Strong: "Yeah, get out of here you fat dork!"  Killian Dain: *Kills everyone, including his partner*  Love this side quest! #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah, the shots backstage made me think that would happen too. So much for my Kyle theory.  #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who comes out to help Drake?  My money is on Kyle O'Reilly... maybe not to be his partner, but to stop UE from the beat down. #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hardcore_Fan101 I think they're gonna get a sweet run over the next year. At least I hope they do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact that #TeamNinja was given matching gear, gives me HIGH HOPES for an actual woman's tag team, and they'll outshine the last duo... The IIconics.  #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll say it every single time Breezango is on my TV: Vince really screwed up with them on the main roster. They're $$$ for real. #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll never be able to get enough of these two teams. Can't wait for NXTUK tomorrow. #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, yeah. I love some Austin Theory, but the dude is SOOO young. That's not bad, but he's got a whole lifetime ahead of him to be a top guy. There's a reason he's "the future"... calm down. #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How you gotta have a battle royal for a woman's #1 contender without Mercedes or Mia Yim!?  Oh, That's right... #WWENXT #WWERAW #Retribution<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #WWENXT... Them: " How long you been a fan of @ShotziWWE?  Me:  https://t.co/dK0zWZvANW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kairopractors Probably a match next week and a title match for the relaunch of NXTUK tomorrow... meh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't wait! #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mon: RAW Tues: Impact Wed: NXT and AEW Thur: NXT UK (Returns this week!) Fri: Smackdown (and #TheBoys on Amazon)  Man, only a wrestling fan would complain about it being a weekend... #BringBackIndyShows #FuckCOVID<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I usually get about 15 minutes into a TV show before a Biden or Trump commercial comes on... at that point, I put on the @WWENetwork and watch NXT and NXTUK all day.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I didn't want to say anything, but am I the only one who forgets that Zayn even wrestled at WrestleMania 36 whenever he talks about beating D-Bry to keep his IC Title?  Good to have him back though. I'm excited #FridaySmackdownTheDayAfterMondayRAW #Slacking<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Long Time, No See!  I've been busy working, building, networking, learning, growing.... Some of my best buds have come along for the ride, and a boost(Freek E. Doyle and Paige Watchey)  This time though, I took the reigns...  https://t.co/tYXPNuAw8R<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only person at @sheetz that ordered food. 4 chili dogs and a cheese quesadilla...  Its been 10 minutes, still no food. #WayToGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TagTeamRevolution  A guy who has never held a title just came out and single handily wrecked the entire tag team division on #RAW.   Yeah, genius.  #SmackdownLive will win the tag team elimination match at #SurvivorSeries #VinceHatesTagTeams<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm a fan of all wrestling, but Lesnar again?!  Sorry. #WWECrownJewel #cancelwwenetwork<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhoenixProWrest  https://t.co/yoEsWea4Tf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is not ok.  Women must stand up against such sickening actions. We must listen to them! In my original post, other women are now admitting he tried to hook up with them when they were 14-16.  #MeToo  #StandUp #WereListening  https://t.co/WtFRA6xReS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProWrestlingMag BWAHAHAHAHAHA!  I'm dying!!!   She was SOOOO overrated, 100% bruh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yo @kfc We need wedges plus gravy plus cheese!!! Million dollar idea. call them bad boys "smothered and covered wedges"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really? #Denied rematch for @DrewGulak?  I can't even!!!!!  #JusticeForGulak #205Live #SDLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Easy, and not just technical talent but all around.... @AJStylesOrg, @KennyOmegamanX, @WWEAleister  https://t.co/EzvXzuPQYK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"How impressive is Mojo Rawley?"  Well, he has a pounce, some rest holds, and the Alabma Slam....  Not that impressive Michael Cole  #RAW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's some #BOLDPrediction  Lashely vs Lesnar, Braun leaves #SummerSlam with the gold Bayley to #SDLive and Charlotte to #RAW Team Hell No gets the tag titles before SSlam on #SDLive Ambrose/Rollins start their blood feud again(Dean as heel) as 2018 ends<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet again @WWERomanReigns wins on #RAW for a shot at the Universal Title.  Hey, @VinceMcMahon ....Gorilla's got something to say:  https://t.co/gQ8bgQ4mSU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It doesn't matter how good that match was, we just got another 45 minutes of @WWERomanReigns opening #RAW  #WillYouStop?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's because Vince runs the #RAW and #SDLive.  Triple H would have made it a tourney where the winner was found the week(maybe 2 weeks) before #SummerSlam  https://t.co/J5BpJNrXV6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I might be wrong, but if you don't think we'll get Lashley vs Reigns next week on #RAW to see who will face Lesnar at #SummerSlam, then I don't know what you've been watching the past few years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@laurlaughland @Matmenpodcast Well then I'll stick with Johnny Gargano.  lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@laurlaughland @Matmenpodcast Shiiiit.... I missed the "Not Roman" part of that one tweet.  I gotta respect and take your word for it now.  Now I'm curious when Mike Bennett/Kanelis is coming back... dammit!  #NoHomo?  lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lesner has the top title on #RAW and is never there. AJ Styles has the top title of #SDLive but will never lose it until 2k19 sales taper off.  Is there a point to titles in current WWE right now?  #Discuss #Debate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@laurlaughland @Matmenpodcast I can't accept a woman choosing who is "turner" sexy.  If they can turn a straight man gay, then I'll only listen to a man tell me. #FaceTheFacts  #IMightDoCurtHawkins<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lashley vs Drew vs Rollins vs Elias vs Balor(Anyone else?) I'm already super excited for this entire road to #SummerSlam!   #RAW #FightOwensFight #BraunCashesInatSS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@laurlaughland @Matmenpodcast False. Drew is Stupid.  #WalkWithElias #RAW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dolph retained so that @WWERollins can go take the Universal Title from Lesnar at #SummerSlam.   #PleaseGodYes  #RAW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dean Ambrose should return tonight to put his name in the hat to face Lesnar at #SummerSlam!   #RAW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gargano vs Ciampa will be legendary, but...  Ricochet and Velveteen Dream  are about to steal the whole damn show! #NXTTakeOver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I laughed when HHH mentioned that, knowing full well she was going to get the Lesnar treatment. And we've been completely right....  https://t.co/YH31UsImqR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Here's your contract Rousey, and props to you for not wanting special privilege"  First match ever, against CFO and COO with Kurt Angle   Second ever match, for the woman's title.   Fuck outta here.... #RAW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope Rousey wins and is never there with the title just so I can laugh and tell you all how right I was since her debut.   #RAW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who want to Walk With Dishonor?!  @LedByDishonor #RAW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I finally agree that this is the time for Bo Dallas to join Bray Wyatt by turning on Axel at #MITB #RAW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So true. I've learned so much doing all video production with local company @PhoenixProWrest.  I enjoy Indies more than some of what WWE is giving us, but I praise everyone's work  https://t.co/3HZekDF5sj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I respect your opinion, but if you think Baron Corbin should be released, you're a little crazy. The guy has killed himself since his NXT debut to fit whatever the WWE needed. #NXT #RAW #SDLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HypaGemie Ok, let me go real here for a triple threat.   Rollins vs Bray vs Corbin(#RAW top3. Fight me)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More of our fave.... that's why we need 97 minutes of Balor vs Owens vs Rollins  https://t.co/pegZb3lhdX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't hate Jinder, but he really does look like the evil, money hungry manger of some subpar boy band and he just fucked them over by signing to manage Hanson on a reunion tour. #RAW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alright, finally watching #RAW before #MITB....  They could have fired Dolph Ziggler and replaced him with Tyler Breeze and no one would have noticed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes, yes. If it's a compelling story, then subtitles shouldn't be a hindrance.  https://t.co/sBkod8wuze  https://t.co/sBkod8wuze<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HypaGemie To make it feel more real. Reigns brought up Lesnar and Dana White.... Gotta keep rolling with it!   I dig this since Chamber. #RAW<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Shortly after coming to #WWENXT, I made this for @itsBayleyWWE .  Time to update after I just bought ANOTHER new "Hugger" shirt from the @WWE #BiggestFan  https://t.co/LYlrRnQuFl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh god, she's the worst. 30 seconds of trying to talk and the crowd started to turn.   #WWEChamber<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh let's set up Rousey/Angle vs Steph/Trips for #Wrestlemania...  #WWEChamber<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We don't care about Drew. Where is Strong to leave with the gold @TripleH ?  You're just like Vince. #fucknxt #NXTTakeOver @PWPNation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ember is my celeb crush, for sure, but she can't be the one to end Asuka's reign @PWPNation  #NXTTakeOver #TheStreak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really need Strong to be added to the #NXTTakeOver main event.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sanity wins! Sanity wins!   2 for 2 with the @PWPNation team! #NXTTakeOver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SAnitY is taking full advantage of the "free bird rule"  It's amazing! @PWPNation #NXTTakeOver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Almas wins!  1 for 1 with the @PWPNation team so far!   #StrongWins #NXTTakeOver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Almas is a great heel. Vega adds to it 10 fold. He's the most underrated at #NXTTakeOver  @PWPNation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love Gargano, but he's going to play 2nd fiddle until Ciampa returns.  #NXTTakeOver @PWPNation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just don't think Ember should be the one to dethrone Asuka, as much as I dig her.  #NXTTakeOver<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I have to assume Sasha turning on Bayley will close #RAW tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wrestlingHT I fully expected this to close the show.... 11pm will be interesting, it seems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itstheashleym I also did not care for you, like at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trying to process #RAW so far.   If Lesnar loses the title he leaves. I can't imagine him losing a WrestleMania payday though.   #Obvious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's just funny anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thinking of starting a new live stream podcast.  "Uncensored w/ Just Bill"  It'll be a smashing success, for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HypaGemie @SliceWrestling Also,  the Shake-up sucks. I want an old fashioned draft.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HypaGemie @SliceWrestling Agreed, but I think Seth is the one guy that can turn it around. Jinder/Orton has been garbage, Seth can save the World Title.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HypaGemie @SliceWrestling @RomanMella98 RAW is stacked, SDLive could use a Joe or Rollins while Cass needs to go to SDLive to improve himself.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NiaJaxWWE Nah, but I'll at least commend you for helping the environment. You're the most green in the WWE.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HypaGemie eh, I like Braun, but it's too obvious he'll win. I hope they swerve us with anyone other than Big Show<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HypaGemie about 4 weeks ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Want a debut and real heat on Samson? Play and sing the ENTIRE length of that ramp while entering the Andre Battle.  #WrestleMania #NXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, I guess we'll be feeling the drift at the Andre Battle Royal.... maybe Raw.   #wwenxt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HypaGemie it's a new episode.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't want The Revival on the main roster. #RAW and #SDLive are horrible for tag teams, right Usos?  #wwenxt #nxt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like, cool, Ohno wins and Samson leaves #NXT. But I don't want to see him in the Andre Battle Royal at #WrestleMania either. Or on #SDLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ducky138 they have a tag division?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shut up, Otunga. Everyone expected Naomi in the match, that's why you never announced any names.... #SDLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you realize the @WWE and @WWENetwork will consume your soul for an entire week leading up to #Wrestlemania.  https://t.co/40DLsoHNy7<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Wrestlemania is 6 days away and you start #RAW by giving Nia Jax a microphone?   Come the fuck on, guys. Get with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, Philly,  @CMPunk had forgotten about all the fans, no reason to try and chant his name....  #RAW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So,  @CMPunk has another UFC fight?   Well, I know who to NOT put my money on.  He's a cock roach that just keeps coming back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love the WWE, but they CANNOT buy and end ROH just for the film library.   #ROH4Life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Paige, AJ/Shane, why NXT call-ups are failing.   Another great "Uncensored" from @Phenomoran w/ @Eron_PWP and ME!    https://t.co/46q7JTlKkB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh it's damn true. Vince wants the green light from Orton  https://t.co/30BZrUjusO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That should have been a Mania victory.   #TagTeamRevolution #SDLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The tag titles up for grabs!  It's the moment of truth, @Phenomoran.   #TagTeamRevolution #SDLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZachE1522 our entire team gets network error when trying to play team RTG. #BullShit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's with this network error @WWESuperCard? Every time my team clicks "play" in RTG.... not cool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Phenomoran Alpha wins tonight, Usos attack after the match, other teams come out, fucking brawl, shitty Mania match...  #TagTeamRevolution<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm dying!  😂😂  https://t.co/bzsmyAjqku<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think we'll see a #TagTeamRevolution tonight? @Phenomoran and I doubt it.   For shame, #SmackDownLIVE and @WWE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_prowrestlingg I'll pass. Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congrats to @NiaJaxWWE! She just ruined the woman's title match at #WrestleMania!  #RAW #RawBrooklyn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope it's the episode of Paige, Xavier and Maddox. I'd like to see the build up before they get to their hotel room.....  https://t.co/o2glxqlAG9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Revolutions are fun, right @Eron_PWP?  #TagTeamRevolution, please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We had a nice woman's revolution, now how about a #TagTeamRevolution @WWE?   The fans always wanted tag teams.   RT to agree!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3 weeks of Smackdown, 3 weeks of almost zero tag team build into Mania.  Give Tag Teams a chance. Fans want to see it.   #TagTeamRevolution<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's always tag team turmoil. Alpha and The Usos deserve better, at #WrestleMania. Why don't they care? @Phenomoran  #TagTeamRevolution<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This March Madness is interrupting my time with @BQQuinn, @jamessmurray, @SalVulcano and @Joe_Gatto   #NotCoolGuys! @truTVjokers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best thing about Drew Gulak: his theme reminds me of Rufus going to the elders before he goes back to give the phone booth to Bill &amp; Ted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who has the better Bod?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPNation I'm convinced he's lowkey Samoan....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPNation your teacher probably knows that black is slimming though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ohno a.k.a. The Dad Bod God is going to get a lesson in being #GLORIOUS!  #WWENXT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPNation the Dad Bod God is going to learn a lesson in being GLORIOUS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I saw some kid drop 10 bucks out of his pocket and I totally snatched it up, he has no idea! #ItsMyMoneyNowBro<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPNation you do know that @RebyHardy is the reason Vince won't touch the Hardys with a10 for pole, right?  She's no CM Punk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On paper, I didn't care about Nakamura/Perkins, but that was a nice back and forth. @Eron_PWP was right about the king of strong style.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Please pray for me"  Oh yeah, that'll fucking help. Idiots.   #Triggered<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Outline a solo cup. Then the area that Murr can't shave is more than double.  Hysterical, but fake.  @SalVulcano @BQQuinn @jamessmurray<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do like the theme,  @KassiusOhno.  You're the "Dad Bod God"!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPNation @PodUncensored @GentlemanJackG huge disdain. He's a cunt and was a filler for Neville until Aries was ready.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TRKG12 what the hell is Bray using?  A lantern? A buzzard? A mad face with dread locks?   I'm very very interested.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope #Wrestlemania sees @mauroranallo and @WWEGraves at the same table for at least one match.   #TopTalent #BestOfTheBest<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ducky138 I was sitting here just waiting for Ambrose to get put through a chamber by Corbin. Only prediction I got right. Haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ducky138 I'm super excited for Ambrose/Corbin no matter who wins.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This week on WWE, Wyatt won the world title.   Next on IMPACT,  Matt Hardy gets a title match, wins in 42 seconds #WWEChamber #IMPACTonPOP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wyatt pins Cena!  It's just 2 years late...  #eliminationchamber #WWEChamber<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That place might riot if they realize we might get Orton/Cena XXXVII at #Wrestlemania   #WWEChamber<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Freaking out that Corbin got taken out with a roll up, but you're not thinking about #Wrestlemania  #WWEChamber   #AndYourNewICChampion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Miz plays the coward, he hides in his pod, he then gets a shoddy victory over Cena for the title at #WWEChamber<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just like the rumble,  #WWEEliminationChamber is the place to set up feuds for #Wrestlemania, don't let it slip by!  #eliminationchamber<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeweyHaveTo I was lucky enough to learn that in 2006 in Central PA!  Can't wait to see more on #SmackDownLIVE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the top of that pod broke, the Miz would have been killed.... crazy. This match is amazing so far  #WWEChamber #eliminationchamber<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NewProfilePic  https://t.co/88XQYVGPyQ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hey @AskWWENetwork, when will 4K be the trend? #WrestleMania I hope!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Number 8! You know what that means.... 2 away from #TEN!  #RoyalRumble @WWEDillinger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@misselizabeth86 that would be why you never reply to my messages! Haha Who's your pick to win the rumble tonight?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@misselizabeth86 Ditto!  I'm always around if you need to talk or need a plus sized male cheerleader!  😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@misselizabeth86 You got this! Just do you!  #yougogirl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I told you.   #RAW #RoyalRumble<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is it! This is the night HHH screws Rollins!    #RoyalRumble #RAW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealRicSantos but, he was far from main event. Bate could main event NXT the day he walks in there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealRicSantos if you don't count Renée Dupree. He was 19 when he won the tag titles with La Resistance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you missed #WWEUKCT, then you missed two of the best guys out there.  @PeteDunneYxB and @Tyler_Bate tore it down.  #TheFutureIsNow<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TRKG12 true. That makes sense.  They went different paths to join, but I'm strangely in love with both teams/ stories/ gimmicks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TRKG12 randomly together? That's Slater/Rhyno. Rated RKO. Jeri-Show. Austin/HHH. Orton joined Bray. Sheamus was forced to join Cesaro....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AskWWENetwork none needed for me. it's perfectly fine after resetting my Roku!  Thanks a million!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If this is like Batman vs Superman, then Miz and Ziggler will be best friends Cuz their home towns have the same name. #Hollywood #WWETLC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really miss those days where we didn't get commercials during a PPV.  #ThanksTrump #WWETLC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone else on the @RokuPlayer and the @WWENetwork keeps buffering/loading every 30 seconds?   Dang. #WWETLC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HypaGemie at least they have more than just the woman's title going on, unlike RAW.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm glad they saw Carmella's heel potential instead of giving her the Enzo gimmick on Smackdown. Mad props to all.  #WWETLC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RawIsGibby I couldn't agree more. They went the right way. I'm excited to see Wyatt/Orton feud American Alpha!  #WWETLC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The rum is warm, the coke is flat.   Still not as difficult to drink as it was to watch Curt Hawkins come into the kickoff.  #WWETLC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshIsenberg4  I think the plan though, is to build Orton turning and being the tag titles on American Alpha. Interesting for sure though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That had to be the slickest #RKO to date.  Talk about #OuttaNowhere!  #WWETLC @RandyOrton<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I enjoy Slater, but Wyatt/Orton feuding for the titles with American Alpha?   Sign me up. #WWETLC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TRKG12 you could have told me that 2 weeks ago and I'd still think you're crazy.   Hopefully a way to get them to American Alpha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here we go!  #WWETLC   #IGotKids<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wanted to die in 2004 and Seasons saved my life.... it's all I can rely on tonight too.  Thank you, @Sevendust you're a blessing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So,  @WWEDillinger is over as fuck.   They keep jobbing him out. I'm mad.   It's time for a #perfect10  #NXT Champion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Young shouldn't be wrestling every week. As the leader of Sanity, he should be a special attraction.   Great to watch though.  #NXT #SANITY<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Not gonna lie, there's something extremely attractive about @WWEAsuka . #NXT #Undefeated  The future is now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AskWWENetwork it's letting me watch from the beginning this time!  Thanks!  #NXT #WWE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AwesomestBen that "shit" isn't as bad as the click bait shit show you just posted about it.   Go away.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You just made the list, @WWENetwork   #FixItNow  https://t.co/S9O9zhgLi4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey,  @WWENetwork , why do you go to the NXT Takeover pre show when  I hit play on the current nxt?  I'm not happy. Nxt is best. #PerfectTen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd lock my kid in a closet if they asked me for a James Ellsworth shirt....  #SmackDownLIVE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My best friend and his wife just had a baby girl.   Boys rule and girls drool. I suggested he throw it away.  #Yucksville<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Haha!  I actually hope that Ellsworth grand kids get a chin.   Who the fuck got that moron over?   Fuck you.  #SDLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know,  #SDLive is barely as good as getting aids.   They need some serious help.... I never want to watch again   @shanemcmahon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hawkins got the Eva Marie gimmick.... I hope he gets aids too....  Smackdown sucks man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Giving away new day vs cesaro/ Sheamus before the ppv just like Reigns/ Rusev last month.... meh, save it for the ppv for a real match. #raw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealSleepySaint I truly belive that Cesaro/ Sheamus will be the tag title bridge to give them to Enzo and Cass by TLC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why doesn't Kendrick get cocky with Perkins about technically being a former WWE World Champion?   #RAW  https://t.co/TAlhuMX6s8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealSleepySaint agreed, but I think that's still quite a few years away. They'll milk the duo for all they can. Tag titles at WRESTLEMANIA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love the new Era, but sometimes it's nice to see two big men kill it in the ring. @WWERomanReigns is doing that with @RusevBUL  #raw #HIAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeChiari @RingRustRadio  I don't care for the promos much, but it's nice to see a well booked match between two super powers/ strong men<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hugh Jackman is going to sue @RusevBUL for stealing the #Wolverine3 beard.  #RAW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would kill for a lunch meet and greet with @itsBayleyWWE.... she's my favorite person in the world!  #RAW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GearheadGurlie @sarahbbraun @IfYou0nlyNews  a building that will soon be vacant was financed, but there's still cancer and homeless vets...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPNation they try too hard to recreate the #CWC on #raw.  What's with changing the ropes every week just for their matches? #tryingtoohard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ryback came out one night, my ex asked "why did they fire him when he was Goldberg? "  Best #raw night of my life! 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't wait for #Ryback! Erm.... I mean #Goldberg  https://t.co/88bARUHfGm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Smackdown needs to beat #raw at #SurvivorSeries so they can steal Cesaro,   Neville, and Zayn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With all due respect, I've been calling Sheamus "Shame-us" since his first title win in 2009 against Cena at TLC. #RAW<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>When was the last time you saw someone leave John Cena laying who's name ISN'T Brock Lesnar? Kevin Owens, that's who  @FightOwensFight #RAW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>KEVIN MOTHER FUCKING OWENS!!!!  #RAW #KILLOWENSKILL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know the tag division is thriving when 5 teams are in the ring and you still don't know what team is running out next...  #RAW  #Bravo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPNation @CoolWrestleNews  Man,  Fuck ya'll..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LadyNeXus13 I'm impressed with the stable now that they are officially heel.  #RAW #NewDayRocks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoolWrestleNews @PWPNation oh, ha ha. Very funny guys...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPNation YOU ARE THE BALL LICKER!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fun Ambrose fact: Since The Shield split, Dean's PPV record is an astounding and crazy 1 and 9. Still super over...  #RAW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG! Fine let's discuss a score card.  Rollins has beaten Ambrose over 7 times in the past 9 months. 4 of which were PPVs. #raw @PWPNation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought maybe I was losing my hearing. She's primed for the face turn.  Cena's manager this summer?!  #RAW   https://t.co/b3tYeo7Ys7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LanaWWE and @RusevBUL are two of the best things going in the @WWE  I love this!  #RAW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"As credible as an Onion"  Shut up JBL, go take a long walk off a short pier.  #RAW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LadyNeXus13 @JoshLopezCSR  I disagree. New Day did it last night with Milk! #DoesABodyGood #RAW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whoa!  Could Bo Dallas be in the #EliminationChamber match?  I BO-lieve he shouldn't be... #RAW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did they give Neville a bag of marbles to stick in his mouth before he started talking?   #RAW #What?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Donald_Wood @RingRustRadio @MikeChiari  Well, wake his ass up and go tell him to watch ANY show from December 2014, he'll see it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HorrorGirlKate What a champion. My ex-wife only got through 5 years before seeking another profession.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPNation Battleground. Kane will get a title match, just to keep Rollins busy for Lesnar's return for SummerSlam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it's weird she's talking about it on social media.  https://t.co/CrVDllE5mS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eron_PWP I'd be your cuddle buddy....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't believe how many times Triple H screwed up Seth Rollins' name tonight.  Can you believe it @Eron_PWP or @PWPNation ???  #RAW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eron_PWP My mother got me this fucking vest 16 years ago. I hate you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Segunomics I think they'll leave out Harper and put Ziggler in, actually. I guess we'll know soon!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eron_PWP Oh my god.... I'm out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPNation @Eron_PWP  he likes stiff. He also likes gay Asians with fancy crowns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love listening to and watching #RAW while working on a script and film ideas, and my new website.... #Billieve<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sheamus, Ryback, Ambrose, Harper, King Barrett and Neville.  Will that be good? I think so, kind of.   #RAW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @TripleH, put @GotchStyleWWE and @WWEDramaKing in the Tag Title Chamber!  #RAW #Vaudevillians #EPIC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ryback22 doesn't like Bullies, unless it's him doing the bullying.  #RAW #BigGuy #BAStar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheQueenHEEL Steph always looks damn good! :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#WWEPayback was a sleeper cell PPV. It didn't seem to get much hype, but it was spot on other than a little slow paced at times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Help out my fellow @TheCinemarks writer, @wickedwitchgal as she tries to put on a #charity concert!   http://t.co/rnDr8qR2hb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPNation I hate everyone who said The Ascension will win. I don't care that they are both on my team either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KirguduDriver2 @Tomlinmw I promise you, Meltzer is the LAST guy I would ever listen to about anything...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tomlinmw @IMPACTWRESTLING @TNADixie Been that way since Double J stepped down. 2002-2007 was AMAZING for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tomlinmw and Dest. America is ALREADY switching their night to Wednesday. Any bets on how long before it moves to Tuesday? #9Weeks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TNADixie I can. TNA does stupid shit.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, time to focus on @TheCinemarks even more, including the Docu-Series it's producing "Press Start To Continue" #Filmmaking #Indies<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HorrorGirlKate You can have Europe, but don't you dare come to Billtopia(Canada,US,Mexico and a random city in Panama I rename "Van Halen")<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HorrorGirlKate Hey, no, you can be adorable with me. We can take over the world and make it adorable. You're stuck with Canada though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HorrorGirlKate Who says that?  Who is "we"?!  lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HorrorGirlKate THANK YOU! Someone gets it! I'm the adorable goof, I'm told.... trust me, adorable doesn't come from my looks. HA!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HorrorGirlKate Probably not as adorable as me, but ok. I'll let it slide. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HorrorGirlKate You could be reading scripts, like I do. I get my hands on JAWS and Indiana Jones and read for hours. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMikeFrizz @WhatCultureWWE Oh, sorry. I missed all the weeks where Triple H was beating women.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhatCultureWWE @TheMikeFrizz I couldn't even figure out 1 reason so no need to read about 6 made up reasons.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RonKillings thanks for the fave!  I hope you read and enjoyed our love for you.  ;) #WHAT? #BringBackLilJimmy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The ball was dropped in 2011 with @RonKillings on multiple levels. @PWPNation   http://t.co/NvwfXs0Exz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whiteXblackrose most will never truly understand how involved it all is. No worries. I just love to entertain.  No coffee though. Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FullSail Ah! You underestimate my sneakyness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FullSail please, don't rush me! I'm thinking!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FullSail Hey, I'm thinking.... don't rush me on this.... hmmmm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FullSail Reel Big Fish?  I completely agree with that!  #SellOut #Beer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FullSail who's the greatest band ever?   Hint: it starts with "sh" and ends with "inedown"<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OliverNorgrove @PWPNation @JayAlletto @Eron_PWP only because I went to @TheCinemarks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FullSail should offer Ministry classes so I can get ordained and go bless those rains.   https://t.co/dTGxWOPrM1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FullSail this is journey, not Michael Bolton..  or Yanni. Shout it from the top of full sail live!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FullSail I'll let it slide, if you get out of my dreams.... and into my car.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FullSail that's because you use Google. Dont be like that!  #cheaters Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FullSail Damn right! Let's do it!   #ImJustASmallTownGirl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FullSail, might I suggest some Steve Perry for #backlot music?   #DontStopBelieving<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whiteXblackrose it's more an urge to tweet people about how tedious and boring it can be. O.o<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whiteXblackrose what kills me is "pre" editing. Watching, listening and trying to label HUNDREDS of files. #editingwoes #savemefrommyself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CampbellCares I threw it away and it's not worth my time or gas to drive back to where I was staying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imarianarose I haven't done that since 2006. #gymtime #hustle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CampbellSoupCo do you have any idea what it's like to lose your marriage, your house, your car, then finding hair in your soup?  Doubt it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CampbellSoupCo can I get my 2.59 back so I can get Chef Boyardee instead?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CampbellSoupCo I was really looking forward to that. It was one of the last few dollars I had left. Thanks for nothing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @CampbellSoupCo I stir my chunky corn chowder for breakfast and this is what I get?  #itsafuckinghair! #nobfast  http://t.co/xIVbxCYkhy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @FullSail, never mind the music, can you stop locking up the fishbowl on Sat mornings? We have  projects to do.  #signedeveryone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FamousBirthdays so does Carmen Electra. .. and Hitler, blah. Lol thank you though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FullSail I don't know who you are, but I will find you and I will tell you that you're amazing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, @FullSail, it's my birthday today. Can I expect exceptional music the the Backlot when I show up in two hours?  :D  #thisisntover<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayAlletto @Eron_PWP @WrestlingRBreak @OliverNorgrove @DanMarren @zheydorn @ZakFellows<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FullSail We want a cupid shuffle flash mob on the bridge. Let's do it!  #tottheleft<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I even tried a sneak attack. Still no music on the Backlot @FullSail.  I'm a sad panda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FullSail as for me, it's all about learning. Enjoy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FullSail don't let me down!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FullSail history of motion pictures.   #Casablanca are you bringing the popcorn?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FullSail class! There's a dream to fight for, every day.  :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FullSail that is also true. But mine would be boring without you....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No music in the Backlot of @FullSail.  Sometimes I wonder why I show up...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My biggest fear has come true.   There's no music in the Backlot at @FullSail today.  #CryingInside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes you have to fall apart so you can put yourself back together as something even better.  #ShedSomeLight @Shinedown_Fans @Shinedown<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WWENXT will be back to @FullSail soon.  Truthfully, that's what I live for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FullSail took time over the break to change the Backlot music.  I'll miss that dubstep song though....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tsbrittanyjane oh, how much I wish I still lived in PA... Come to Florida with me!  lol<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FullSail script writing and preproduction. You can all join if you want. You bring the PB&amp;J!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthWagler That's why he keeps getting paid to make these shitty movies. I guess the power actually is in the numbers of people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HailmakerPod 110%   She leaves for a few months then comes back...obviously JUST for the 'Mania payday.  What a joke.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FullSail I won't tell,... many.  Mine was Power Rangers. I still have it somewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FullSail because its Michael Bolton.... O.o<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FullSail Michael Jackson.... or Michael Bolton. Though most might hate me for the Bolton idea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder if @FullSail will ever have more than 3 songs playing in the back lot.  I do love Dropkick Murphys though...  #StudentWoes<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DeweyHaveTo I knew he wouldn't win, but she should have been final 4 with Reigns, Ambrose and Wyatt. No doubt!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse It's always done the same way. This time it should be Rollins turning on the 'Powers' instead of them turning on him.#Bookit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Team_PWP obviously, but only being in the authority makes sense and that will kill the Bray Wyatt character.  I hold hope and will watch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickGator depends on the package and cost. Email me bro, I want to be there!  Wmshannon13@gmail.com<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Team_PWP they need to separate, sure. But it makes no sense. Bray was wasted and ruined an amazing match, unless his answers tomorrow rock!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrestlingMANIAx the darkness was too long, no doubt.   But Wyatt? Makes no sense. I hope we find out on raw, but I doubt it'll make sense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Team_PWP, what the fuuuu....  That ending makes no sense and took to long. Is Bray part of the authority? Still makes no sense. Dang #HIAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheFansPodcast I don't get it. Until I hear from Wyatt tomorrow, the ending was lame. It currently makes NO SENSE!   #HIAC #WWEHIAC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@adolfoag3 aside from Rock/Cena that was two wasted years for two shitty matches.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need Paige to win so I can finally be ahead of @ZakFellows in the @Team_PWP predictions.  I have little faith though.  :/ #WWEHIAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE @WWEDivas @WWEAJLee @RealPaigeWWE so you're saying AJ/Paige is next?  Time to get food and go pee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Team_PWP, time for Rusev to take the US title. Especially since Sheamus retained, as I predicted.  #HIAC #WWEHIAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Team_PWP I'm only down 1, Cena/Orton.  I hope Paige pulls through. I'm 2 above Zak right now.  #HIAC #WWEHIAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, big show is coming out. Yes, I went to get chili and rum. It takes him 12 minutes to graze down to the ring anyways.   #HIAC #WWEHIAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoelleFoley Mizdow should be your stunt double. That writes itself. #epic #HIAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just had an argument with my wife that #Mizdow is a better performer than Aerosmith. True story.   #HIAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Orton looks like a wrestler. Cena looks like a twat I've beaten up outside of the arcade 16 years ago.  Meh  #HIAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"@TheFansPodcast: Randy Orton will hit an RKO out of somewhere. #HIAC #HellInACell" maybe outta nowhere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Orton/Cena number 846 at #HIAC.  Still better than any episode of #TotalDivas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh shit, Orton will win. They are already talking about the debut of Kane at a HIAC.  Kane screws Cena, gets an RKO outta nowhere.   #HIAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm shocked that Orton/Cena is not closing the show.   Whoever decided on putting the PPV name on the side of the cell is an asshole.  #HIAC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I don't care how AMAZING the tag match is, I just want @ViktorRiseWWE and @KonnorWWE to come out and destroy people.  #WeWillRise #HIAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't care. After seeing Nikki adjust her top in the match, I want to bite her nips more than ever.   #HIAC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Nekrosangelo that's very true. Too bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope Cesaro wins just so I don't have to listen to twitter bitch about Cena burying him. #RAW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see Cesaro stole Sandow's robe and neck towel.  #RAW #CesarovsCena<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Matthew_Seven You are, retard.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DMarren96 DOn't give them any fuel...Cena wasn't even on RAW last night, unless I totally missed it. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DMarren96 People who say it's gotten "So bad they might as well not watch" clearly haven't been watching and just read that Cena is champ.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you suck and no one will cast you, please don't write shitty things to act it so you can try to be seen. You're a cunt. #Film<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DMarren96 yeah, I'm fighting with some technical issues.  O.o<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DMarren96 lol thanks man. I aim to entertain!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DMarren96 yeah, that's what happened. Jay asked me to come back and keep posting on the fb fan page. Been back since lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DMarren96 I have no clue cause I blocked him. I left the group for 5 months cause of his smarmy shit.  I won't listen to his pwpradio.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DMarren96 he went total smark, praising stupid things TNA was doing while pissing on good things the wwe did. I went ape shit on him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DMarren96 jay and toph are the only admins. J is a busy dude and toph hates me so probably loves that tool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DMarren96 he says that? Shit I hate him so much. Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DMarren96 that guy is exactly who triple h was shitting on, but Russell would never know it, no matter how many times you tell him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"@DMarren96: Triple H's jab at the marks of the IWC was great #RAW" no question asked. I loved it!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ZakFellows @WrestlingRBreak I will be catching up with Summerslam, you ball licker!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrestlingRBreak #Scumbag for life!  Rollins has the case, but Ambrose has the trigger being pulled. I love it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrestlingRBreak did you see the show yet?  I want my fucking ambrose/Rollins point god damn it!  @ZakFellows<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm pretty sure that @TheDeanAmbrose could tear apart Hugh Morris within seconds.   Stupid security!  Let them fight.  #WWEBattleground<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieMariexx well, I don't stalk your pics oranything but what I do know is even a hot mess, you probably still turn heads. No worries lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieMariexx depending on the day, yes I'm very cute at times. Lol sometimes a miracle does happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieMariexx NOOOO! You don't say?!  lol ;) make a move next time you're at a show he's on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieMariexx hey, I love cute pale girls. Like, Paige is AMAZING!  lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jagnarok Sheamus. They already unified the main titles, time to get rid of the US title finally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieMariexx haha you still look pale compared to him tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Zack Ryder is looking very orange.  I guess when you're not given matches, you go to the tanning bed.  #WWEBattleground #BattleRoyal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"@NickGator: THE LOOSE CANNON IS BACK #WWEBattleground" I did not see Brian Pillman there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrestlingRBreak I've known harper for over a decade. I knew he and usos could destroy it, but they honestly blew my fucking mind tonight!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrestlingRBreak dude, that was the best tag match I may have ever seen in my life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrestlingRBreak a lot better than anyone seems to have thought it would be, based on what I've been reading from the smarks. Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrestlingRBreak well, it was no spoiler it seems. Lol no worries, mate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeremy8911 I don't care that they did it. I just don't want to see Rusev get Hassan'd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"@WWENetwork: LIVE NOW at #WWEBattleground: @RusevBUL vs. @RealJackSwagger!" Glad this will still happen!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why I hate AJ.  1. She's crazy 2. She skips around like a 12yo, and looks like one.  3. Worst theme ever.   #WWEBattleground<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just want to see the Paige heel turn already.  Sexy and evil?  #FuckYeah!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nekrosangelo @iamtheaj no. Paige had been on mine since her arrival to the states/nxt. Eat me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley if so, I will be first to offer my shoulder for her to keep crying on. I love her<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nekrosangelo but, but. .. I love Paige!   She's on the top of my list!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#omg. I love @RealPaigeWWE   I hope she teaches AJ a lesson.  #PaigeTurner #WWEBattleground  #heelturnbaby!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fans win. Ambrose and Rollins get the match thrown out and need pulled apart by officials.  @WrestlingRBreak  #WWEBattleground #WWENetwork<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ambrose/Rollins next after that tag match?  I think they might be shooting the load too quickly.   #WWEBattleground<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2 out of 3 falls! Harper will make the final pin and win the tag titles.   #WWEBattleground #tagteamtitles<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01 There's always a plan B.  ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01 Given the current events of this past week, I expect Swagger to be over, BIG TIME. It's wise to let him beat Rusev too. win/win<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01 Well, they ruined Hassan. I actually like Rusev. I hope they don't repackage and ruin the guy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01 I'm curious to see how they handle Rusev/Lana/Putin etc... after the Malaysia flight. Only time will tell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01 He's going to end Rusev's streak tonight at #WWEBattleground!  #WeThePeople<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01 No love for Swagger?   Damn!  lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01 I hope you mentioned Swagger getting the biggest pop on #RAW of the past few years. My mind was blown. lol<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PWNPodcast @bravestPAPAyA 0 outta 4 is pretty f'n bad. But Strangely it could be his year. I feel another cash in loss no matter what.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nekrosangelo I SAID SHUT UP, SIR!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's #MITB ladder match time!  Shut the fuck up @Nekrosangelo and let me enjoy the FUCK out of this amazing match.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nekrosangelo I was thinking outside of a box. Bryan would announce he was replacing #BNB and win.  I so so fucking far from being right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nekrosangelo Yeah, there's no way Rollins will walk out with it.  Fuck it. I predicted Bryan would enter and win. I'm a loser<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRawLibrarian Dude, my wife was bad mouthing Paige before I even told her I added Paige to my list.... I just kept quiet, for now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nekrosangelo Good luck for who? Cena is going to walk out on top.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRawLibrarian Ah, well then, start having the PPV parties at the usual place and charge friends $3 each. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TurnbuckleTees DAMN YOU!  You're going to get me divorced when 9 shirts show up at my door.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRawLibrarian What are you watching it on? I've had NO issues with it on the Roku.  #MITB is great so far! lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nekrosangelo K8lyn left, I get a new choice. Fucker.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can NEVER get enough of @RealPaigeWWE.  Give her all three hours to wrestle, talk and just stand around.  #MITB #StoleMyHeart<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@y2stump He's the last member. Pretty sure he killed and buried the other 5 that were left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The thing about The Wyatts vs The Usos is that no matter who wins, we're going to see them wrestle on #RAW tomorrow AND next week.  #MITB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I spotted the beautiful @NoelleFoley behind the Spanish announce table and temporarily forgot that #MITB was going on...  #Yup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BullDempseyWWE, congrats on the NXT win. I'm already a fan!  #ShootfortheStars<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WWEDanielBryan is about to announce that he's cleared and entering the #MITB contract match.  Get ready to bow!  lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JavierIVIorales Wrong picture. He first cashed in on Cena for the WWE Title.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE_Alysa15 nooo! He's my favorite! I don't believe you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE_Alysa15 what news?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01 I agree, since the US and IC titles are pretty much rubbish anymore...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01 It would be hard to pull off without just saying "Hey, damnit, we need two titles again"  I dunno about that theory. Could work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01 Plus IF Lesnar does take the title at SummerSlam, it would kill Rollin's momentum and amazing Heel work to turn face and cash in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01 If Rollins wins the contract, I'd expect him to keep it for a few months and rub it in Dean's face...AND Orton's face.  #Tension<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watched "Breaking The Code" for the 5th time. I love @IAmJericho and admire them using @FOZZYROCK music  #BreakTheWallsDown #Y2J<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01... you don't think @WWEBrayWyatt will walk out with gold tonight?  #MITB #MITB2014  http://t.co/bbzJNGyefM<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WWEAdamRose Actually, he does have a twitter.  It's @ZackRyder #WWWYKI #LongIslandBunnyHop<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RRWWE @WWE  the MITB winner will be Daniel Bryan.  NO doubt in my mind.   http://t.co/aYzRSZXOO1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01 @RazK28 Now you have to wonder: Was #BNB injured or is it a work to get D-Bry in the match?  #MindBlown lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01 @RazK28 Why else is it so crucial that he's addressing the fans before the PPV even officially starts? #ThinkOutsideTheBox<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01 @RazK28 My official predictions are close, however D-Bry will announce he's replacing #BNB and win the contract.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WWE_Alysa15 I kinda got fired today for being too good.... so depression has found my body. So has Rum. Lots of rum. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE_Alysa15 More depressed than bored. But I know what you're saying love!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrestlingRBreak If I pull your name out, I'll do everything to get an all region one sent bro! lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sunshine48oX I love everything. Their version @Shinedown "Simple Man" will forever be the greatest song ever done. ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sunshine48oX I start most work days w/ @Shinedown. Live from Kansas touches my soul and brings me to life, no matter how bad life seems<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sunshine48oX YES!  @Shinedown is the greatest group/band to have ever assembled. They saved me multiple time! #BrentSmithMightBeGod<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TJ_Niggleswerth I agree.  @JerryLawler is a cunt and I've wanted him to fuck off for over a decade now.  He makes me turn the channel ALOT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How do I get you to act in one of our short films "K8lyn"?!  #CelestialBodies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse is giving away the @HeymanHustle DVD on 8-05-14! Like and share on Facebook!  http://t.co/zb7WZIsdWV  http://t.co/4UmICAh77J<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@STBDamianDragon But without dreams, our souls would become extinct and nothing great could be accomplished.  Good luck! Wish I could help<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dextasy1 I see what you did there....  #90skid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell Speaking of Sting, Robocop/Sting come in at a close 2nd with Gobbledegucker safe on third.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell Actually, @ZakFellows knows what I find to be the worst storyline/angle ever. He just doesn't know he knows. #PeoplePower<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell @PalomaStarr  J-O-B Squad.  I get it. They're gonna pin me, pay me later tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey Jerkoff number 2, Filming 'The Asylum' today. Got a good question? and where is our cute chick? @askbillmitchell  lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell I tried that too.  #pepperspray #profiling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell to bad it doesn't work like that with women.  I stare and the police come....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell And everyone would stare, unsure of what the hell you're actually trying to say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #Director and #producer of #brb in between a crucial scene! #acting #action #onset  http://t.co/KuITDirRTS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmac708 Just letting you know I finally had a free minute to check the soundtrack link.  It works. #DrunksLIkeUs #ThankYouPaul<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell I was going to film The Asylum but it's hot and my chest is too hairy to tape my mic to me. Think about that  #SweetDreams<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Slamboree 2000 on the #WWENetwork and I have to ask.  How was anyone able to work with @MarkMaddenX and not kick him in the face daily?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE_Alysa15 haha me too!  Hope you're loving up the Summer!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE_Alysa15 I love it!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE_Alysa15!!!  I need another wrestling question to answer in my next video?!  Got one, sugar?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley, I need one more great wrestling question for my next video. ... got one?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BeliebersStandByJustin   Because  #BeliebersAreMorons<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahbenesi If you're that worried about predators then you should just call @Schwarzenegger and maybe @CarlWeathersEat for back-up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell @PalomaStarr wait, this is a wrestling podcast right?   I don't want to call into some weird sex show. ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell @PalomaStarr now this? I did not know this. Carry on trying my good man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell @PalomaStarr  Dafuq? You could have told me you're already booking guests for our show that doesn't exist!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PalomaStarr, you can join us. It'll be "2 jerkoffs and the cute chick" @askbillmitchell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell @PalomaStarr  Bad Ass Mother F'er<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell @PalomaStarr   Lol just curious about overall interest in listening to crazy Bill and the BAMF.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell  You say "another" like @PalomaStarr isn't the first one.  Not too sure I can keep "Crazy" in my name. gotta give it to you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmac708 Saw the email on my phone. Didn't go into depth on it yet. I'll let you know tonight!  Thanks my friend!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell Yeah, ok.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell  You have a crush on @HillaryClinton?  Excuse me while I go vomit and then plot to end your misery...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell At first I thought it said "Chipmunk" and I do love Alvin and Theodore.  But @CMPunk ?!  #What?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell Who the fuck is @CMPunk ?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@y2stump no worries. I turned my anti Rock chat into a cheap Foley like plug. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@y2stump That's alright, I didn't either. I complain about his potential 2015 HOF induction in my video  http://t.co/2qaqyM25iS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@y2stump So you never took The Rock serious huh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWMania I don't know if anyone even cares anymore. #TNAwful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse hmmm Interesting. Have at it @gregdemarcoshow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse I know...but you know the numbers that could entice one of those guys to offer up their time to interview with someone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmac708 I will get behind dedication and integrity long before I get behind something that "sells". You have it all man. I got your back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse you should get one of the people just released from WWE on #PWPRadio.  Yup!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmac708 No worries. Just keep doing what you love and entertain us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>40GBP is 70 american dollars. But I like this @paulmac708 guy and #DrunksLikeUs needs to be made.  #crowdfunding #indiefilm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmac708 but does the DVD for backing you ship to the US?! lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmac708 We did 19 episodes of a webseries with no budget and just the little money we could find for feeding the cast. #JustDoIt ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greekgodpapadon I'd rather see you in NXT. They let them be so amazing and your matches would be 5 star instead of getting lost on RAW.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmac708 @andreastefanci  She can rescue ME!  ;)  lol Good luck doing this film. Just never stop. NEVER.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell As long as they don't touch my indie webseries that all of 18 people watch, then I'm a little more OK with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This weekend I will average working 21.5 of the 24 hours that exist each day.  #RedBull #Monster #COCAINE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell uh, yup!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell Well, I have been judged for worse. Like the time I was drunk and put on a fishnet bodysuit with no clothes under it. O.O<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell Plus, being on the radio, I can sit here in just my speedo without being judged.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell You are right though. A podcast between you and I would probably be the most epic thing the world could ever come to see<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell Just another casualty of war man.  lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>'The Asylum Q&amp;A' is up under the @PWPowerhouse banner.  It only gets better from here! #RAW #WWE #TNA #GFW    http://t.co/2qaqyM25iS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell I was...  #Sarcasm. ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell I  mention @RealKevinNash because he's a genius and has probably come across assholes that ran things into the ground. O.o<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell Nothing could go wrong. Right @RealKevinNash??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell Give him enough creative control, his massive ego won't care as much about the paycheck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell ditto man. Just started a 2nd full time job today. I'm stretched and limited for a while. Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell I only did 5. And I would only use punk for 6-12 months just to get his fans to start watching.   And bully is a great heel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell: Rob Terry, Bully Ray, Ziggler, Angle and CM Punk.  #GFW 5 I'd go after. Uploading 'The Asylum' right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrestlingRBreak Unfortunately, AJ is also like an Anti-Diva. Not sure how they'll work it but those two should be really good together.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrestlingRBreak It would have been great. They need an unsanctioned street fight at #SummerSlam #AssesInSeats #Buyrates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrestlingRBreak I think they are just buying time until AJ comes back and she can have a real feud with Paige.  I do love Paige.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrestlingRBreak Well, Meltzer is a cunt, soooo....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrestlingRBreak Expect HHH to pull Reigns out of the match on Smackdown. Since Reigns was "banned" his win doesn't count. #Obvious lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrestlingRBreak Ziggler got a huge response from his hometown... it's a wonder The Miz didn't make a return to TV (and beat up K-Hart )<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrestlingRBreak It was meaningless for American viewers too. Don't worry. #RAW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yup, I'm down 75lbs since Xmas 2012. Hopefully another 75 in the next two years!  #Billieve #awesome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SassyStephie who doesn't love @Taeler_Hendrix  sometimes even @AMANDAxCR ;) lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@midgetsftw no doubt. I'm usually always around if you need to chat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@midgetsftw Holding onto the past will only hinder your future.  #Billieve<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MbernadetteE I concur. Sadly I'm in Philly now and not a single @sheetz to be found. :/  #MyOnlyPrayer is #SheetzInPhilly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse power rankings?   #1. @WWERomanReigns, after #Smackdown the other numbers don't even matter anymore.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WWE_Alysa15 good I might stay in MI?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE_Alysa15 someday I will take my comedy and entertainment all over the country. I'll start in MI. Maybe I'll find a reason to stay. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE_Alysa15 Well I could just stay in MI but I prefer warm and sunny Texas over both choices. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE_Alysa15 Well I would, but I wouldn't want you to be super sad when I came home to Philly. ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE_Alysa15 Do not make me come there and prove you wrong! I would be all too happy to do that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE_Alysa15 i dunno. I'm charming, amazingly funny, semi-good looking, fun and spontaneous...  good luck trying!  ;) lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE_Alysa15 Oh, well then good!  Just imagine dealing with me in person. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE_Alysa15 Don't cry. You never know who's falling in love with your smile.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This one just made me think of someone, even though it shouldn't make me think of them... Meh.   http://t.co/1GJDKDNyjv<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I feel bad calling people out on their crowdfunding campaigns, but I just wanna help everyone be a little more successful. #Taffered<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrunksLikeUs Sending a perk ONLY if you reach the goal is a rough sell. Love the concept. Good Luck bro!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WWE_Alysa15 haha, you should see/find out how fast a hummingbird's heart will go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE_Alysa15 Yes. the smaller the animal, the faster the heart beast to keep up it's functions and to keep it at a sustainable body temp.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley I lack the understanding of the fascination of her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE_Alysa15 I'd  have to read the punk/aj stuff to get a feel for what you'd enjoy first<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE_Alysa15 I'll write ours and then not let you read it. Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE_Alysa15 no one has written our fanfic yet huh? Rofl<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WWE_Alysa15 I agree. I love big, shiny, tell all eyes. I stare in them lots. haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE_Alysa15 I was kidding. You'd have to tie me down before getting it on my face. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE_Alysa15 I'm might have to try and and see how awesome I look! :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, @BShopWindow... we want a "Raven's Flock" t-shirt!  #FUCKYEAH!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse has some GREAT new writers! (Yeah I've been slacking on it) Check them out and read some awesome stuff!  http://t.co/sz8xiKNgbq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrestlingRBreak People don't seem to know that Steph admittedly didn't even know HHH as he started his rise. Great read! @PWPowerhouse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's always the darkest before the dawn.  At this rate, the dawn should be here momentarily.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank God for vodka and @ReelBigFish! #ShesSoFuckingCuteIWannaLoseMyMind<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieMariexx Indeed!  Though I do love WWE too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieMariexx I get it. It's like me with a video camera, wrestling and taco bell. haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieMariexx Just gotta keep the head up and keep smiling.  Life's a garden: DIG IT! :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Few things in life are harder than looking at the worst moment in your life and admitting it was all your own fault.  Maybe it's Rum O'Clock<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieMariexx Mer?  ??  lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieMariexx Depends on your faith. Congrats on being strong and beating it though! :) Maybe 'Karma' helped you because you are good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieMariexx Yeah, same here. I had a life altering event in 2008 and decided I should make peace with Karma. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieMariexx Trust me, I'm not one to brag. Not after the first 20 years of my life. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"@WrestlngRealist: @RealCrazyBill @gregdemarcoshow TNA is the snake eating its own tail...#implosioncity"  indeed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got a sweet new ride Yesterday, raining today. That means I'm staying inside instead of cruising with @Shinedown blasting!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bob Hoskins passed away and everyone on twitter still only cares about some lame LiLo movie from 10 years ago.  #Lame  #RIPBobHoskins<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieMariexx Thanks. I'm much nicer, friendlier, more kind etc... than what most may think when reading my tweets or FB. #BigHeart<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieMariexx I usually don't. I don't believe in high horses. I hate to think that people think that I think I'm better than them. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieMariexx but... one time was to build a house for a poor family. That counts for something, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieMariexx I was never there. I've been to Mexico twice though! :D lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@midgetsftw No, I meant... But it was...  I mean...  Oh, ok.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FutureEndeavors @DXDONMEGA  It's about time. I couldn't figure out what the hell they were doing and why he was still there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieMariexx Kinda. Just find the star and turn left. You'll get there, someday, maybe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time to finish filming for @PWPowerhouse. I love using the green screen and talking wrestling!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieMariexx Oh, well just follow the north star and you should be able to find where you are going.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieMariexx It would only be a loss if you were more awesome than me. It's ok, don't worry. No one compares. ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieMariexx hmmm I'm debating this whole "Lets be friends" thing now....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickGator @ZigglersQueen81 They brought him to RAW like 3 times and each time he was sent back  quicker than the last. Da well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieMariexx It's rare I partake, but it's also Diet Mt. Dew, so there. :p<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieMariexx Oh, that's a whole different story then. My chocolate fix is ONLY Reese's and I drink Mt. Dew on those occasions. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@midgetsftw Well, cars belong on the road.... so they have a point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickGator @ZigglersQueen81 I commented on the PWP page a few days ago that I was shocked Mason was still around. Guess not, anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieMariexx Sometimes, but usually just chocolate milk. Weird cause I don't care for chocolate.  Hmmm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The newest episode of Tilted Straits is AWESOME!!!  "The Bohemian Rhapsody"   http://t.co/nPLzjPlR2H<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieMariexx  Oh wow.. A lady after my admiration.  :D  lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieMariexx fair enough. though if you can't be yourself.... ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieMariexx I've been doing that for a good decade now. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParamountUK I'd rather kill myself. Thanks though...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gregdemarcoshow @WrestlngRealist I've been saying that for years. But Dixieland was the LAST straw. They've fooled me 9 times. #NoMore<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RichBrennanWWE I mean no hate! An elbow is not a splash and Charlotte's finisher is nothing like a DDT. Congrats on making it tho man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__waitandbleed Sweet!  Though I'd get you a few without the banana liquor in it! haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__waitandbleed It was at Dave &amp; Busters.  They were Banana Split milk shakes. AMAZING! I would have had 10 if I could. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UberFacts @__waitandbleed the three I had last night sure as hell had alcohol! :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't get enough of @itsBayleyWWE. That smile, that personality... amazing and contagious!  #NXT #NextWomansChamp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieMariexx Yeah, @ProWreSyndicate is always amazing. @PWPowerhouse does interviews and such all the time there. Can't wait to go sumtime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After a few episodes of #NXT, I gotta ask @RichBrennanWWE, can you learn what some of the moves are before going back to the announce table?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley nope. I got crap for saying I'd already fire her if I was Vince.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They were so busy ruining Cesaro's theme that they still haven't had time to give Aksana decent music. #RAW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nekrosangelo @HeymanHustle @WWEZeb @WWE  Tuxedo match... while giving promos?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We want, no we NEED @HeymanHustle vs @WWEZeb in a tuxedo match! #raw #WWEBaltimore  @WWE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You just cut off @HeymanHustle, the greatest manager EVER, for commercials?  #Lame #RAW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaitlynJK hmmmm. well at least Cliff is funny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaitlynJK So you literally live with your own "Cliff".... lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Emma/Santino make me want to drink whiskey until I stop breathing....  #RAW<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CrazziiB That's you?  Wow Congrats!  Been doing DDPYoga too. Trying to get back to where my body stop hurting lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieMariexx They have some great talent, but I stopped watching a week or two after AJ won the title and left. DixieLand is like suicide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieMariexx I follow a lot of all of them, except TNA. I refuse to be burned by then for a 7th time. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieMariexx Depends. I never cheered for Barry Horowitz. In theory SCSA was the underdog. The "corporation" was trying to hold him down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieMariexx  EVERYONE tries to throw around that word just because someone lost/got beat up. They sound kinda dumb usually.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please, stop pretending you know what it means for a wrestler to be "buried" Don't be a clueless smark. #RAW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do love #BNB! Too bad he blocked me for making better Bad News than him. #RAW #ICTourny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley Between plugging the app and @JerryLawler telling jokes that make me want to kill myself...well, you know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley Did everyone already forget that Kane and him were working on a feud before Punk pulled his walk out crap?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrestlingMANIAx Watch out for the "Smark" shit storm...  BTW, don't be shocked he's not Main. Punk never was either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamKristiKiss Thanks Ksquared! :D<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LaurieMariexx I was planning it, but my buddy from Scotland and other from Vegas decided to wait for 31, rumored to be Philly where I live<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieMariexx That's not even! I haven't been to a single one yet. Maybe 31 will be my year. :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieMariexx haha Yup! Sadly I'm still missing 9 of them from my DVD collection. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>GAH! Fucking women!!!  Either they are fucking clueless, morons, or "offended"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieMariexx They are related because it makes me feel older than it should.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieMariexx Closer than the 19yo kids I work with who make me feel old by having no clue about The Godfather, Reel Big Fish, or WCW. :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurieMariexx Damn, I'll be 31 on Sunday. thanks for making me feel even older than that! haha ;)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@totalfilm Well, it's not like any of them will ever need to work again anyways. He's come a long way from Not Another Teen Movie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, #HijackRAW was a complete failure.  Good Job, #RAWChicago. @WWE beat you all like an unwanted puppy. #RAW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe if the #RawChicago crowd actually did #hijackRAW, Punk would have come back. I doubt it though. HA!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01 he's a better heel. I can't say I'd care for his return as a face.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01 I personally got overly bored with him as the Heyman feud started<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01 you're one of those punk fans huh? Raw has been better than ever the past two months.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Christian and Sheamus had an amazing match. #RawChicago is full of douchebags.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BryanIsWWE @JavierIsWWE I hope so.  WWE doesn't roll the fans enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01 @PWPowerhouse  THE PEOPLE!  WE ARE!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01 @PWPowerhouse WE!  THE F**KING PEOPLE!  'Murica baby!   :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01 @PWPowerhouse  WE THE PEOPLE!  WE!  THE PEOPLE!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse I feel pretty safe to assume, at this point, I'm blocked 8 times over...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone else want to agree with me that the "People Power Era" was the worst thing to ever happen? I already turned #RAW off. #WWENetwork<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Radio1045 @gwenstefani @GavinRossdale probably something stupid and pretentious. Not as bad as Jer-Majesty, but still pretty shitty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01 Eh, he would just walk out again before you got to really screw with him. Better to be swift and fast. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01 No. Not everyone. Just the smarks who sit in a basement and masturbate to Lita.  I hate EVERYTHING Matt has ever done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01 He's already proven he can't be trusted. Can't trust him to be in the ring and care about making sure the other guy is safe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01  I'd let him walk and I'd keep every penny of every item sold due to breach. I have more principle than WWE lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01 GOOD!  He should be punished.  "Prove you can support your team and we'll let you play next time"  @WWE @CMPunk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01 There's a reason the ONLY time Matt got over with the fans was because Lita cheated on him with Edge.  lol I laugh in those faces<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Being a filmmaker(or aspiring) I don't care about the #Oscars. Awards mean nothing, I want you to laugh and smile.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01 He better not be. After pulling that shit, he doesn't deserve to be on the 'Mania card.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01 Can't say I miss the guy, but he was definitely more entertaining than Matt Hardy could ever dream of trying to be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BITW102 Again.  Steph and Triple H are the boss.  O.o<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE_Alysa15 Thanks!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE_Alysa15 Well, I watched old WCW ppvs, wrote a short script and made this Cena/Wyatt promo for Wrestlemania!   http://t.co/yUObTvXYf1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE_Alysa15 Probably. ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickGator @RonMotta @DXDONMEGA Too bad WCW didn't actually have their own original music.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonMotta @DXDONMEGA @NickGator WTF is with @WWENetwork editing @IAmJericho's WCW music to be his WWE music?  #LAME<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BITW102 @SashaBanksWWE Weird, the only Boss I saw at #NXTArRIVAL was Stephanie and Triple H.   Care to try again?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stories From The Set: Tony 'The Cube' Romarco played by Brian Valeria  When we first had the idea for Tilted...  http://t.co/wCWul6E3SD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickGator @WWE @RonMotta I made the mistake last night of watching the LAST PPV, WCW Greed.  YIKES!(for the most part)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cena vs Wyatt.  Pretty sweet fan made promo. #WrestleMania #WWENetwork  #RAW   http://t.co/yUObTvXYf1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FilmMusicSite Does that say "Original" cause it looks like a shitty white boy version of Fast and Furious. I pass 100 times over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>May God have mercy on the soul of the world today... I'm about to eat it alive.  #MyTime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnCena vs @WWEBrayWyatt fan video.  Place your bets for #WrestleMania!   http://t.co/yUObTvXYf1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@italianleopard Sorry to hear that hun!  Let me know if you need to talk! :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@italianleopard Well I never had it so it makes no diff to me. haha ;) Hope all is well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm taking matters into my own hands from now on.  You have ALL brought the day of reckoning upon yourselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@italianleopard This is why I don't even call my mom!  #BadSon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CamelClutchBlog Glad someone gets it. WWE doesn't give a shit what the fans do as long as they fork over ticket $$,and the fans do it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HEELBrooks moron<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing better than a grilled cheese, rum n' coke and writing a script on a cold Friday.  #BOOM!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HEELBrooks @WWEHDTV_ @WWE  Nope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ViktorRiseWWE Great match, just wish you would have eaten The Rhodes Bros. alive instead.  #TheFutureisNow #NXTArRIVAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AJ_Lee_95 @WWEHDTV_  With only one title now, it'll be a LONG time before he gets it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jeremy8911 I'll be really interested to see Impact ratings from tonight.  I bet they drop to 0.5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone else feel like the #WWENetwork is just a huge ploy to drive people to the WWEApp since it works poorly on other devices? #NXTARRIVAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bytethatcast Yeah, it froze for me on the Breeze entrance and I got on the App as Rusev was leaving the ring.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone actually see any #Impactlive tweets tonight?   Those guys are screwed...  #NXTARRIVAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bytethatcast It's fine on the WWEApp.  Annoying, to be driven to the WWE App all the damn time, but it does work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trust me, I am NOT a BOleiver.  At all.  #NXTArRIVAL #WWENetwork<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRawLibrarian It stopped playing on my Roku player.  It's going just fine on the WWEapp on my tablet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@littlerocky32 To no one's surprise.  I'm not even doing that. ha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll be interested to see #impactlive's ratings for tonight.  #NXTARRIVAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWECesaro vs @iLikeSamiZayn!  Match of the year?  Probably #NXTArRIVAL #WWENetwork  http://t.co/cFI8vzb0dv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NXTArRIVAL soon! Check out my spotlight on some amazing talent like @MmmGorgeous,@itsBayleyWWE, @ViktorRiseWWE    http://t.co/TgyNjkgbzP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gregdemarcoshow Give it 15 months and they'll all be taped on some random Tuesday morning in an alley outside of Universal Studios.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like @PWPowerhouse on facebook for live #NXTaRIVAL posts tonight!  http://t.co/GwF3OP7ktt @JCD1219NY, @Tru_Individual, @WWE_Alysa15, RT!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#RAW this Monday is going to suck. Punk won't be there and every fucker in the arena will ruin every match by chanting his name...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayBradleyPW Oh yeah, that's on tonight.  Already too damn excited for NXT though. I won't be tweeting her.  #Meh. #BOOMstick<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley I think it depends on the man.  I've scared a LOT of those girls away.  haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickGator They can play the best stuff ever and I still only want to see #NXTArRIVAL!  #WWENetwork!  #ZAYNIAC @iLikeSamiZayn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickGator I've been watching for three hours.  Just had on the RAW with Austin on the Zamboni. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheNewman2492 I could be a biased @TripleH fan, but getting him at #WrestleMania is almost as amazing as getting a shot at The Streak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheNewman2492  I don't get it though. win, lose or draw, @TripleH is A+ and it would have been super high profile for Punk. I'd pay for it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like @PWPowerhouse on Facebook for my live thoughts and updates on #NXTArRIVAL tonight starting at 8pm #WWENetwork   http://t.co/GwF3OP7ktt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ImpactLondon or #NXTArRIVAL?  Gee, gosh, I don't know... hmmmm Oh gosh.  #Sarcasm. #NXT Baby!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Muse83 The @RokuPlayer 2.  It'll play 3 or 4 minutes then have an error, and if I "Resume" playing it plays the same 3 minutes again. #Shit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fix the fucking VOD system already you twats! I'm already thinking about cancelling the #WWENetwork.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWECreative_ish Yeah but Punk is a crybaby. Who could have walked and NOT screwed over Bryan in July anyways.  F' him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahbenesi BTW I love your blog posts.  As a script writer I really appreciate your "quick details" not drawn out, to the point!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahbenesi Well, if you need some WP help just let me know.  http://t.co/ORVscwJ3py isn't as good as  http://t.co/xEM4MQpOz0. More options!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahbenesi I like the layout 110%, I like the first WP I ever did too.   http://t.co/gU6qFz9Frg  It was a sweet first try! lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahbenesi The site I write for is pretty spicy:   http://t.co/sz8xiL4jdq  It has multiple accounts for us writers to post and looks sweet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahbenesi Is it a WordPress site? I'm good with those, my business partner though, he's amazing with anything...even custom coding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jimmyfallon is a cunt who can't keep a straight face and looks into every fucking camera. I hope he dies. #MeanTweets....cunt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahbenesi You should have a site that's less "super blog" and more website with a blog/articles/news. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse I just remembered, I still have to call in and go toe to toe with that fuck head Toph.  Maybe after 'Mania to tell him TNA sux<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley ;) I'm that strange, interesting guy that peeps luv to see but only shows up 2 or 3 times a season.  #BANG! #CrazyBill lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley That's soooo much more boring that calling, hijacking a live show, then winning....then leaving.  lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley The prob with a recorded podcast is that I can't call in live and annoy you while hating on the IWC. I stir pots baby!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley @PWPowerhouse I don't care for BTR, but I would do a BTR show with A-Rad.  Ok, maybe every other week. #FilmingWoes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley Ummm I think the word you were looking for is "Crazy"  I'm very Crazy.  Hence the name!  ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MizfitMathew just posted this on the PWP fb page (with credit of course) lol  http://t.co/lK6DOX2LP6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley If I was a celeb, it would be me.  Don't lie... DAMN IT DON'T LIE!!!!!  lol ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley #PWPRadio is always looking to expand and help others expand with them.  @PWPowerhouse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RottenTomatoes Haunting?  No.  It looks like crap and it's not one of 16 planned 2014 movies I will see.  EVER<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Heersink @PWPowerhouse It's all valid. It's all true. I'm pretty sure I refuse to believe otherwise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SexyChuckieT "I wrestle for $10 but I'll buy that drink!"  Yeah, might be tricky to pass off as legit bedroom material<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CamelClutchBlog I didn't miss it, I just ignored it cause I hate Hogan.  ;)  Probably an awesome read though!! lol  ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @BeyondThe3Count "liked"your FB page and Followed the twitter. Should be good!  U can check out my articles! ;)  http://t.co/9XyG6WB5sy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HuffPostComedy @LateNightSeth  Pretty sure Biden IS the joke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JLokiRock08 @realmickfoley  That's true. But I would expect more "industry professionalism" from him, especially from him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JLokiRock08 U kno @realmickfoley is my favorite. But I can't agree with how vocal he is being. He's fueling the IWC fire and he shouldn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got two up today!  One is a review of the #WWENetwork!   http://t.co/1JWRAjxFHQ @PWPowerhouse #WWENetworkNotWorking?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #IWC is ruining it all.  #WWE #TNA #RAW #IMPACTLIVE #WWEChamber @PWPowerhouse    http://t.co/crQl4D5Ra2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I firmly believe everything I wrote about @WWEDanielBryan, @CMPunk, @WWE and fans in general.  Stop ruining the show.  http://t.co/crQl4D5Ra2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01 hmmmm  I need a new plan then.  Fine, you two fight and I'll just hijack the WWE jet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01 While you two are fighting, I'll be backstage stealing your SHIELD shirts, not cuz I'm crazy, but cuz I'm poor.  bwahahaha #Evil<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SCOTTHALLNWO @RealDDP  Make it your own, Bad Guy!   Get out there and kick some DDPYoga butt!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01 You vs Your Sister.  STILL a better Mania match than Orton vs Batista. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01 lol hopefully she doesn't follow you on Twitter then.  She might already know!   O.o<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01 Hmmm, the Punt could allow optimal time to climb to the 3rd cell and get Ambrose out.  Go for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01 damn. Never thought 30 would feel so old. Haha. RKO from the top of the cage huh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01  Maybe a WCW style Triple Cell with Ambrose locked in the top cell.  If you're old enough to remember that match. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01 Hey, there's a lot of people in the states that would pay good money to see you two fight over Ambrose, I'm sure.  lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01 I've "fancied" him since his FCW/NXT days, before The Shield gimmick. Ambrose is a loose cannon.  I love that stuff! lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01 Clever on the Reigns phrase. Glad at least your sister has good taste. ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01 See, this is where I ignore you... #TeamAmbrose   lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The_KevinBeard Oh man, I was wishing someone would have punched the 4 or 5 morons chanting 'Husky Harris' at Bray last night. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dstokie01 Irony: Make your own SHIELD shirt, SHIELD breaks up.  haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a tragedy to have lost such a brilliant mind in the industry.  From writing gems such as Animal House,...  http://t.co/lX0sl92yhi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The_KevinBeard or Jersey and Chicago could ruin the whole show. I'm ready to kill CM Punk chant starters too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Emma looks more stupid than a challenged kid at Make A Wish  #RAW #WWENetwork<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayRedDevil @HeffernanRules @SteveLemme @jaychandrasekha @ErikStolhanske I prefer Super Troopers and Club Dread over Beer fest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn't this the @WWEDanielBryan match we want to see him win at #WrestleMania?  #YESYESYES #YESMovement   http://t.co/VEikiEZffA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @twitter, tagging in mobile is the worst thing ever. I honestly want to kill a baby when trying. You have totally failed on this....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Damn damn damn.  I had to brag on Twitter that I had no issues with the #WWENetwork and now it's stuck trying to load this PPV. Oh well<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CuntsLikeUs Been trying to.  Having an insane few weeks for our webseries. I'll get there! I hear good things about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZakFellows I think it's more like "I might only have one more match in me"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZakFellows either retire, or bring back the giant sunglasses and kazoo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZakFellows Who comes back after 7 months of doing nothing and proclaims "One more match"?   He needs to retire from the ring already<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nekrosangelo That would constitute Alcohol Poisoning.  A risk I'm willing to take to play this game...... brother<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every time @HulkHogan says "Brother" at @WrestleMania, take a shot.  Pray that you don't pass out before the first match. #Wrestlemania<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley 15?  Yeah, maybe on RAW.  #WrestleMania?  I'm making a drinking game of it. "Brother" = A Shot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZakFellows Eh, well he was the only one of the 5 competitors who DIDN'T pin Randy Orton.  Maybe it was a fluke. #OneMoreMatch?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZakFellows are you saying he doesn't have a chance in the #EliminationChamber?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ZakFellows still a better joke than twilight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Enjoy #Smackdown and then get a sweet shirt!   http://t.co/bZ5pflQ7fK<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What a moron and cunt that "reporter" is. Fucking virus, that what he is... a disease<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tylerconway22 even the tweet images you use say 42. Go Away. Bleacher Report guys should all just die....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The guy was 42. I hope someone rapes that B/R writer who can't fucking add with simple math on his fingers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tylerconway22 Hey.  Nelson Frazier was 42, not 43. If you can't even do basic math, stop trying to write for a website.  christ.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Twitter just notified me that @iamtheaj and @Nekrosangelo were talking about The Simpsons.  Yeah, there's a fucking surprise.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Watching the only real and good @RoboCop on @SpikeTV right now! #PeterWellerISRoboCop<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Heersink I never had to side with anyone. I ALWAYS thought Matt Hardy was the most useless guy on my television, and now on the internet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@midgetsftw The only history that Americans care about is the US owning the British in 1775. So they COULD change the Titanic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@midgetsftw I thought it would when they made it 3D.  I thought: "Hey, 3D? Maybe now the boat will see the fucking iceberg!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@midgetsftw Also ideal if you're watching Titanic.  I hate seeing that boat go down...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWTorch Nah I stick with the super impressive AND FREE @PWPowerhouse podcast and site. Those guys entertain me for days on end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let me say, if Lita cheated on Doink The Clown with Edge, fans would have cheered to bring Doink back. Matt Hardy isn't that loved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrestlingMANIAx But Hardy wasn't that good and brought NOTHING to the table unless he had Jeff with him. I hate him as much as Nic Cage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobinHoodTax That's not the real Tea Party, that's the GOP... big difference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWTorch But there are so many sites that copy and paste for free, and get people to podcast for them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse That's true, but I think now they have to show stock holders $$ from the Network and NOT from the PPV.  Vince and H know it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lagana yeah, but I don't tune in.  Well I do on Friday morning but I turn it off and DELETE it after 10 minutes.  It's all good, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeweyHaveTo If you act or do film.... let's do it bro! haha :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse with the Network coming, does WWE no longer have to care about Buyrates on PPVs?  I say yes.  Hence: Batista vs Orton at WM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lagana .......................... Nope. I bet @TNADixie's period button isn't broken either. She's on it weekly and ruining the company.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lagana Hey, just following the usual Friday Morning for the past 4 months.  I wish them luck, but I give up on the A LOT...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yeah, give Eric Bischoff the keys to TNA.  Go ahead @HulkHogan then we can have the fucking Aces &amp; eights back.  Asshole.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell Eh, either way. I should have stopped when Aces &amp; Eights was in full swing with Brooke fucking Hogan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell I don't even know. My last Impact was the week before AJ won the title, I think.  maybe a week or two before that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HuffingtonPost I don't think @bobmarleycomedy is 69 today...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell @facdaniels  The Fallen Angel would be gunning for that title. Tho I love Bad Influence SSOOO fucking much!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell I would pay @facdaniels triple so he would be himself AND Curry Man every week. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell I dunno. I'd still rather the TNA up until they got the old timers.  '02-'05 or '06.  Sonny Siaki was my favorite!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're busty and try to hide them, I won't stare.  If you got big tits and wear revealing clothes, shut the fuck up if I look at them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell I expected Sting.  I thought Sting was the investor.  I would have cringed, but still better than MVP.  #DAMN!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley The beauty of proving you wrong with that: I just wrote an episode of Tilted Straits where the bartender LOVES NKOTB too. :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@donzig316 HA!  He did wrestle that night in his Mr. Ass attire.  Green with blue and pink lips.  (No clue why I remember that)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse Oh, of course.  They are giving Magnus the Orton treatment. He can't lose yet. He needs to beat the 'big guys' first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sethmikey Same place as Foley. Up in the far north east of PA. It was April 19th 2008, neither had WWE contracts at the time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cassidycomedy Yes, I'm told about it all the time, but based on other movies I must be cautious before agreeing to watch it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meeting Billy Gunn the same night I met Foley is pretty F'n amazing too.  Just saying!! #SmokingGuns #NAO  http://t.co/UZJFv3FnuO<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse Can you explain to me how, after losing to Bully and never getting a title match again, Sting has a title match next week?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cassidycomedy Coincidentally, I find all Nic Cage movies to be poison.  Maybe Cage is the devil!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Heersink Sting lost to Bully Ray months ago and can NEVER have another title shot.  Next week: Sting gets a title shot.  #Lame #TNAwful<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tnainsider By 'New' does she mean 'old'?  #Probably<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse haha Jake's Wayback Burger. They do a competition every year to see who can eat one the fastest. Only under 20mins counts. lol<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sethmikey If I had a laptop I would, but my Galaxy Note won't connect so....F**K! I had a Roku 5 years ago too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell @PWPowerhouse  Well, it should take 6 minutes but I can rant and swear about them for hours.  37:19 is a good compromise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sethmikey Man on Feb 24th, @WWENetwork can just take my money.  Looks like I need a @RokuPlayer for my TV now!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell @PWPowerhouse 37 minutes and 19 seconds will be used each week to piss on TNA ruining what could be a good story.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse Dude, know any wrestlers in the Philly area who want to try acting in Indy projects?!  haha. No Seriously, do you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bytethatcast NXT is the best thing going.  WWE might do it every week just to laugh at TNA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell @PWPowerhouse I'm super easy. Whatever works best!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell @PWPowerhouse  I do not.  I have to stand across the room cause I'm loud and my voice carries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell I do tend to record #Smackdown and watch Shark Tank.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell If I can direct and co-star, I'll pitch that to #WWENetwork immediately!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell I do love me a chick that would put me through the bedroom wall!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RottenTomatoes @BreakingBad_AMC  I don't get it.  Guess I never will. After 18 episodes I couldn't watch anymore.... meh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@askbillmitchell, what would make our radio show stand up from the rest?  'Diva Boner of the Week'!   #BOOM! roflmao<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WWE_Alysa15 I've been saying that since I was 6, no one cared and it hasn't made me super awesome. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @PWPowerhouse when do I get a radio show with @askbillmitchell?!  Better get the parental advisory ready.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE_Alysa15 I don't doubt it at all, but for acting and her looks?  I don't get the obsession the world has.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE_Alysa15 I watched a movie with her in it last night.  She's pretty average actually. I won't pay to go see her in theaters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FIirtationship @WWE_Alysa15  No.  No she isn't.  I'll take 100 different people before even thinking about her. ugh<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse You have me sold on Lesnar/Bryan.  Bryan needs the win at Mania for the strap.  It's the logical completion of "The Authority"<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Do you follow your heart or your mind? The difference is such a fine line.  One may be right, the other wrong. Follow this #Sad sad song<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey, @trishstratuscom, @realmickfoley said I had to ask you if you would describe him as "Sleazy" (I know the answer though) #FoleyIsGood<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xo_nightmare_ox  "Stewart Gilligan Griffin Sanders'?   #Winning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamKristiKiss $40?  That's Cheese steak, rum and a ticket to @HeliumComedy!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go like me!  Then RT so everyone else can like me.   Just don't love me and then break my heart!  https://t.co/5e88M6lbIT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamKristiKiss Damn right, and I'm telling no one I found it either!  Except for 244 followers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamKristiKiss best part is the $40 came from my wife's pocket meaning it was probably my mother in laws lol  #KeepingIt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamKristiKiss Now you know to put $20 in a few pockets before you hang the coats up until next December.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Heersink so very true. Luckily I wear most of the hats but I still have to answer to myself. I'm not as hard on me though lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is nothing better than finding $20 in the bottom of the washer, except for picking it up and it being $40 #Epic #Winning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickGator trouble for Hockey tweets?  Says who?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Heersink Luckily they are scripts and I have no editor. But it's still just as important!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@italiasweethart It might be.   ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@italiasweethart O.o You don't know that.  My head cold could be a carnivorous ear worm eating my brains... You don't know!  :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@italiasweethart  :)  Hey, sometimes it's nice to be taken care of when your sick and in need. We just get over dramatic about it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@italiasweethart Yes.  Being offended now trumps freedom of speech and it makes me want to kick baby squirrels.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@italiasweethart Spoiler Alert:  All men are miserable wimps when they get sick.  #MostMen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DisturbingPict @WWE_Alysa15 Coincidence because they aren't all true. And if one's fake, they are all fake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@italiasweethart Sounds like you're going back to bed for cuddle time with the kiddo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse Coincidentally, the bottom on the right very closely resembles the NetWWEork logo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse Yeah, that's what I was thinking.  1 or 2 out of 15 are decent?  #Lame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse   http://t.co/c9jm8XhtUl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse They all look like a 10 year old designed them. You'd expect better from a publicly traded billion dollar company.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse Did a bunch of B.A.Star 5th graders come up with the new WWE logo ideas I'm seeing?   #Christ Almighty!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrockLesnarGuy Trying to prove to a co-worker that someone knows who Steve Perry is.  Any idea or did you stop believing too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jhollandmoore @HuffingtonPost If this was @Delta Force, Chuck Norris would get the bag back for you, and the baggage fees.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Werey38 @BrockLesnarGuy He won't tell me. It's a huge gambling guessing game.  I think Mighty Morphing Power Rangers, but I may be wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrockLesnarGuy @Werey38 He won't follow me until I get him a new shirt.  #StylinAndProfilin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse  I might. But I've disliked @TheJimCornette since he hit Jake 'The Snake' with the tennis racket when I was young.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nekrosangelo The whole thing was getting me.  "YES" "NO"  "Correct!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nekrosangelo I get a kick out of this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse Nope. I don't like @TheJimCornette so I won't listen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is kinda what I mean by "we can't follow every word" @italiasweethart #FCKH8 @FCKH8  http://t.co/HWKSM1cjUh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time. To. #Write!  #Right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @italiasweethart, come make this!!!  http://t.co/8gW0Lou2zE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamKristiKiss awesome sauce!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamKristiKiss c'mon. What fat man doesn't?  Depends on the place though. Not sure if I can get out of working, but I might be able too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamKristiKiss I don't have a foot fetish though...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamKristiKiss I have a feeling the rum needed to get you to philly will be costly, but worth it to see Anchorman 2 drunk with you roflmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Brinno_Global I don't need pictures of the Jehovahs Witness who lives down the street. He already annoys me....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, it's somewhat awkward to ask a girl her measurements for lingerie after only meeting them for 30 minutes. #FilmingProblems #film<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So hey, anyone want to go see Anchorman 2 with me next week?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good luck today @italiasweethart!   I'll be thinkin' about you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for being such a smug douche. It's only 5:30am and I'm ready to have a beer. Pulling out #RBF early today.  #Beer #SellOut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@italiasweethart You clearly didn't know the name of this game is "I Win"  ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@italiasweethart Excuse me, those were my first words when I was only 6 weeks old.  I win!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@italiasweethart wait a tick!   "Awesome Sauce" is my thing!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@italiasweethart My favorite ska song EVER, then I'm done tweeting you Ska lol   http://t.co/ZP8NdcyYU0<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@italiasweethart  "Take On Me" done by Ska band, Reel Big Fish.   You're very welcome!  :D   http://t.co/wPJrDgX5Tp<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@italiasweethart If it were me? I might buy a movie studio...next to Disney Land.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please allow me to introduce me. Half of me slave, the other half free.  Who I am is in between what I wanna be and what I am. #Supertones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sunshine48oX yeah, so if you can log off my Pandora account, That'd be great. Thanks. Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sunshine48oX whoa. Just read that as smells like teen spirit plays on my Pandora at work.... creepy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This mall is horrible. I got so much done for my business before customers actually showed up today... that's good, at least<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iLikeSamiZayn was given the #Spotlight! This star will turn your heads and make you a fan again!   http://t.co/BaVaETxfcI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse If I go to WM 31, I'm booking Virgil to be my travel companion for the entire weekend. #winning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After the holidays, I'll never set a foot in the #Plymouthmeetingmall again. This is a fucking joke...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So much for being off this week. Just call me "No Days Off" from now on.  @DarrenYoungWWE can relate, I'm sure!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"@STBDamianDragon: We inherent who we are. But it does not have to dictate who we can be." This. #somuchwin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@italiasweethart I'm the sweetheart, you're spectacular. Win/win baby! Yeah!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"@Nekrosangelo: I will not rest until @BigELangston renames his finisher "The LangBanger!" and I know @RealCrazyBill agrees with me." Yes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey world, @italiasweethart is just swell!  &lt;3   Don't be jealous!  :D<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@italiasweethart don't get me wrong, I will DVR it, but Psych is just so amazing. Ive wanted this musical episode for months already lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mall opens at 8 am. I Get here at 7 and find out they changed it to 10am and told no one. #plymouthmeetingmall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> http://t.co/ynTkwN7iRi Thought I'd finally give in to the world of blogging....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The wild west was never this wild.  http://t.co/IvBMuylhwz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@italiasweethart We share a love for #BarRescue, but I have to go with @Psych_USA: The Musical tonight!   :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What do you do when you feel yourself thinking about her more times than the sun has risen? #SheIsAwesome<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IamKristiKiss I've done a lot of working this weekend, guess I needed a paycheck!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley bored. Dreading driving home in this Philly snow storm shortly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need to go to #NXT and start massive #WeWantKruger chants!  @WWELeoKruger is a Godsend! #TaTa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The2ndGMTEL It's so depressing I think I lost my appetite.  :/  #Kruger4Ever   #NXT @WWE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse I sit here, weeping, eating a cheese ball, watching Leo Kruger videos on YouTube.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse then again, why listen to the dirty sheets? I bet 6 others reported that first cause they were bored.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse nooooooooooooo!!! Don't cry, don't cry, be a man...  That sucks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't believe Orton is apologizing for bumping into Steph. Remember when he punted her a few years ago @PWPowerhouse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SMACKDOWN!  Haven't been able to watch it in weeks!  here we go baby!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Matthew Perry is getting another sitcom? I like him, but clearly no one has learned a lesson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#worksucks and I just want to write and film.  That is all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If your profile pic is just one of the "IWC Darlings", I'm not going to follow you! You're probably just a #smark.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE_Alysa15 I haven't had Christmas Break from school in over 10 years. So, every day is a break!  :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was only time before arguably the best guy on the roster got the spotlight! @iLikeSamiZayn- this one's for you!  http://t.co/BaVaETxfcI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RavenCyarm @hoeskiiii you check celeb tweets to make sure they're 140?  derp you. Get a life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AustinAries heard cause I had no protein. I then drank 2 protein shakes a day, no sugar... still felt run down. Need more knowledge I guess<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sheetz Can you guys come closer to Philly. I'm dying out here!!!! Wife won't let me move back to Altoona just for Sheetz! BLAH!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AustinAries @PriceIsRight No.  NO!  I tried it for 6 weeks and I felt like total crap. No thank you! It's all in your mind.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WWE_Alysa15 Ummmm.... I have no comment about how dirty this sounds....  O.o<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks @PWPowerhouse for reminding me about @WWENXT and the articles. I love NXT more than anything!!! @WWELeoKruger is #BOSS. #TheFuture<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse I would have made sure #TeamPWP and 4 of my top guys would have all been on the floor for it!  I passed on 30 for it!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse Fuck I want to cry... and I haven't cried since since Shockmaster debuted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When the movie is called "Busty Cheerleaders" but there's no Leanne Crowe, I grow very sad. @thebustyblogsit might agree<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nekrosangelo It's sad that the few @CW_Arrow episodes I've watched are better than most HUGE budget Hollywood movies the past 5+ years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bored while waiting for this contractor guy... Hey ummm... @AliceRadley, thoughts on NXT?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClaireDunderman I did this last year, but no one cares about the Galaxy S2.  #iPhoneRulesTheCookieWorld!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Daniel Bryan is hot right now, Punk is the greatest champion. I only want to meet @WWELeoKruger and @itsBayleyWWE though! haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh my God, @WWELeoKruger is hands down my favorite of the past decade... #GiveUsKruger #TaTa   http://t.co/yi84pGwfe1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse seems to post the #NXT Spotlight every couple of days. I want to break him and send in 6 before the next is up. #AWESOME<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I blame @PhiladelphiaGov for not getting #WrestleMania 31. Now I have to be miserable for many more years. #Fuckers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is up Straighters!?  We hope everyone had an awesome Hannukah and Thanksgiving.  Here's to those celebrating...  http://t.co/jUUiLNxruv<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Nekrosangelo I may still go, believe it or not. Pissed I passed on 30 thinking Philly could actually win 31<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse yeah, same here. He's like Cesaro and Joey Ryan's love child... looks wise lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse do you know a God damn thing about Aiden English? I can't find anything online about him before NXT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Headway can't figure out how payroll works. Electronic stubs with no pay. Good job. O.o<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse Just got Zayn in before having to rush to work... Hope it's good! Feel free to change the YT vid I linked if you want short<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamKristiKiss sounds like he doesn't respect much... O.o<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamKristiKiss THAT'S what pissed him off?  Fuckin' weird....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamKristiKiss lol I can only imagine that it was him. Btw, I don't believe in DTA. I trust a lot of people as I can be trusted lol<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#BlackFriday? #Ignorance? #RapeyRush? Nah man, just #FollowTheBuzzards @WWE_Alysa15 @CrankyAsshole @PWPowerhouse  http://t.co/SjSZtdjtKW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley lol I know. Just making sure I adress anyone but him, I even named zak hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley I'm going for the ignore him attack and saying things he says as my idea, like he doesn't even exist :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE_Alysa15 hey! Awesome dear!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley oh, yeah.. wife! Riiiight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley nor shall I then!  Bring on Kaitlyn and Tamina!! Yeayeayeeeaaa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley *blank stare* typical... I can dye half my hair blonde too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley they sure are. The guy won't watch it, but will complain like it's his f'n job. At least Toph will watch the show first!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley lol thanks... something in me just says: "take them down a peg or two!" Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley yeah, he's almost as bad as Toph in my mind...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley ummm wait, what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm a stubborn man.  The hatred I have for one will lead to the deaths of many.  This is our creed. #HappyMonday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a good time to be stubborn because I fucking HATE that piece of shit smark. Fuck his TNA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley That's a good gripe. I hate when he does that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley  That's ok. I decided to drink and call him a Mark instead of go to bed for work in the A.M.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley LOL  I might rather those than Toph<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley Nope. I got under his skin so he'll bad mouth WWE for a few more hours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley I still laugh when I see that!  LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley lunch?  It's midnight!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley  http://t.co/yFgCgtB7ok  Enjoy!  :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley Just because I made a parody video of Warrior, that doesn't mean I like him.  Knowing is half the battle!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley He always gets under my skin.  It's worse when I have a few sips of rum. But still.... GAAAHHH!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley Entertained by what?  My hatred for Toph?  Weird.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've never hated a wrestling fan as much as that fucking mark... Christ.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse and also TNA right now.  Fuck Toph.  "Had nothing to do with TNA" then brings up TNA.  FUCK HIM!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There he goes about #TNA again.  Fuck him.  Cunt.  #PWPRadio<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck Toph #PWPRadio.  Fucking mark.  I hope he gets out of the IWC cunt hole soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kayla_magill @BestFaceSwaps Who cares?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You fuckers were complaining for years that #WWE should unify the titles. Now you're bitching that they might?  Fuckers. #SurvivorSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm drunk and I hate pretty much all of you.  Let's fucking troll people, shall we?!  YUP!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mdibbs88 @BrockLesnarGuy Who didn't?  go away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley I agree.  they missed the boat on yet another Survivor Series.  "The Big 4" it's just the "Big 2" anymore. Mania and SummerSlam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley That was a pretty pathetic bone.  I hope they make up for it on RAW with the story.  Rest of the show was awesome though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley That's why Orton/Big Show will be amazing. The wrestling might be 'meh', but the story told will humble any living being.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley True. I hated ADR/Christian a few months ago, even though the match was amazing... the build was HORRIBLE!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley Nah, the match was good.  Sure Del Rio can't build up anything, but he always has good matches<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley I hate that people said this match would be total crap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SurvivorSeries has been great so far, aside from that really boring guy.... @RealCurtisAxel  http://t.co/cxmolgbqTm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamtheaj Cliff and the Cap are "Friendzies"!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamtheaj Wait until you see the RP I'm doing right now! HAHA   it involves a claw machine, fried food and threatening 'Richards' life...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SlateRandallWWE @Finn1830 @Schwarzenegger Got those lines backwards bro.  #poser  ;)  (Watching it too, thanks)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley GAH!  Such language!!  I don't know if we can be friends anymore, holy fuck!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley Just get that kid from One Direction to talk to them on your behalf.  ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamtheaj Who the fuck posts the matches for a show without letting anyone know WHEN the show is?  Fucking @TimmyTabor, that's who!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamtheaj @kvltism @Nekrosangelo The Hurricane Cliff Theme/Tron  http://t.co/mpTZQXgnQe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamtheaj @Nekrosangelo @kvltism I KNEW YOU"D LOVE IT!!!!  I actually wanna go with "Shark Adrenaline" as the finisher lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamtheaj @Nekrosangelo @kvltism I may name Hurricane Cliff's finisher "Katrina's Blow Job" Yeah...  :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tru_Individual 8 Years ago.  My feelings have been squeezed dry ever since.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tru_Individual I have no feelings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamtheaj I have an idea of who Alastair Lawson is and I hope to not feud him. He's too sophisticated for The Hurricane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamtheaj So epic that I'm not even going to chance ruining it with a reply!  lol   awesome!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamtheaj if he ever goes heel, it'll be Just Cliff... cousin of Just Joe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamtheaj BOOM!  "The Terrhurtsables"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey you, yeah you!  Did you see all 10 episodes of Tilted Straits yet?  Season 2 will see THIRTEEN!  Already...  http://t.co/Y9Mr7fxy6j<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamtheaj @Nekrosangelo @kvltism  "Emotion doesn't make a match" -CJ I hope that cunt is killed by a pack of rabid wolves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nekrosangelo @kvltism @iamtheaj  What?  I'm not Hurricane Cliff, man.  Get off it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kvltism @Nekrosangelo @iamtheaj I'm even more pleased I got to make Donzig's guy look stupid too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kvltism @Nekrosangelo @iamtheaj Hurricane Cliff will make Brad Richards look like a Doucheball any day of the week!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another great and amazing day of filming parts of Season 2!  We can't wait to get episodes out to you in February...  http://t.co/SGjNrVnFPK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley No.  Only some do.  Like my first GF. Then my 2nd girlfriend.  Then I met my 3rd who is my wife. 3rd time's a charm!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley Insane?  "Working to give your GF things she wanted, only for her to brake up with you because you worked to much" #Crazy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley I once worked 3 jobs, 98 hours a week.  I would drive home and was never sure how I got there after a 20 hour day. #Scary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donzig316  http://t.co/OzWa6rNjqb   Enjoy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley Traffic, traffic, lookin' for my chapstick. don't hit me with that brick, LOOK! There goes a ford maverick!   :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley Agreed.  At home: 1 hour talking to wife. 35 minutes cleaning. 2 hours writing. 7 hours on FB/Twitter talkin' about writing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley haha As do I!  All the time! You could say I'm an expert at it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley Long week here too.  Long weekend coming up as well.  But sorry to keep you distracted.... I mean no harm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley Oh yeah, they are!  Especially from an audio stand point.  Don't "haha mebee" me, it's true! It's damn true! lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley LIES!  lol  Hogan/Piper are better than me and my series, I can't deny that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donzig316 What's the name of SOD?  Just "Son of Donzig"???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donzig316 Fuck the fairy looking Jimmy Jacobs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley You're behind because you were on  http://t.co/c4HunQpJdr and watched our show?!  I'm cool with that!  :D  haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley Yeah, but I created and film a Web Series that I expect people to watch on their computer, while I hate watching on it lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley Me too.  I love to stream old stuff to my TV.  I hate watching stuff while at my computer.  #irony right? lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley Truth.  My wife takes them and I know she truly needs them to help herself. I came to Philly. stopped meds and was fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley actually before 1994, but that's the earliest thing I avidly remember on a regular basis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley I've been watching since Yokozuna beat Hogan after a 'fireball' to his face in 1994! Just ask for what you need. I answer!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley I took meds once. I felt slow, dumb, and useless. I have never put a single drug in my body since. NEVER again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley WOW!!!!  That might be the worst match of BOTH of their careers.  I loved it! But it was a feud/match unneeded. Seriously!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaycenBradley AS long as they don't eat off my plate on that 'First Date'... they can charge whatever they want!  ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley I'm stubborn and strong. I'm really bipolar, but I refuse to admit it and take meds. Drives my wife insane sometimes lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I should think about bed. 10+ hours of filming tomorrow, but enjoying a "we're fucked up" heart to heart with @smashley_ashley lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donzig316 I do alright with them.  Who's the SOD rep?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley Yeah, but being "Crazy Bill" it's hard. I love the attention, but I hate having eyes on me.  I'm not Ok.  lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donzig316 I can dig it!  I'm "Hurricane Cliff" in the e-fed!  Theme?  hmmmm  I think this...    http://t.co/4HVXm77sXD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley It's my fear of being in a crowd that cripples me from doing things. I always feel judged, like I was in school<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley It's a plus when I'm writing scripts and go "People won't get that joke"  lol  We are special, and awesome! ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley Depends on the situation. I over think everything and come to 97 conclusions to it all. makes me a great worker though! lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't wait to film with @TiltedStraight tomorrow morning!!!!  The set is already looking awesome!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley I'd rather that than doing it to my very few friends... Thankfully they accept it and just keep on keeping on!  :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley Yeah,I know. It's hard to think people think the worst and you always have to explain...making you look even worse.  lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donzig316 I f'n DIG IT bro!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donzig316 SOD should kill The D then....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley I also grew up feeling the need to justify, so I do it with a LOT of people. Mostly just in real life though....  :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donzig316 Oh christ!   Please do!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley I like to think I've found the perfect mix of crazy, funny and awesome.  Take that for what you will!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donzig316 Baron might be a "legend" and can only do 1 season...  Join up man!  Seasons are 3 months it looks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emily6931 Please go Rape yourself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley Only after a few drinks. I'm a good guy, but I like to make people question thoughts and beliefs... Ok, I might be crazy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donzig316 we haven't started yet, but ready (in 2 or 3 weeks I'd say) to do Seasonal E-Fed!  AJ, Timmy, Ripper, Slam....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley I admit my language is shit when I get mad and/or passionate.  But I mean well for all, usually! haha I'm not Crazy eaither<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley I've only used it once.  maybe twice.  But that's only to make Zak feel good. The Brits ALWAYS use it! haha  Sorry dear<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley It's the best distraction ever!  I apologize now for my constant language and the 'C' word I use a bit....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donzig316 Explain what fucker?  Go to the site, join, follow what we are doing, then fucking Roleplay with us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley I see you are finally hanging with us in the PWP group on FB!  Congrats!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donzig316 Hey you fucking fuck!  We're coming back! (kind of)  http://t.co/U1gUgi23Cc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse If I wasn't filming ALL DAY, I'd come tear it up with #PWPtv at @ProWreSyndicate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One day in 2014 I'm going to talk @JerryLawler into doing my documentary: "Finding Kaufman"(Working title). Then go to ABQ, NM!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SFBatKid So amazing...  http://t.co/NXP3rC5Sp3  @WWE_Alysa15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donzig316 @Nekrosangelo @kvltism Copper might have been a dickbag, but at least he wasn't the fucking Baron, or the 'Murican Destroyer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@midgetsftw Ditto.  very few games and I fucking DESPISE Lord AND Star Wars.  I punch geeks who are dicks about it. Right in the throat!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donzig316 @Nekrosangelo @kvltism who the fuck is Green?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamKristiKiss yup. Just kind of popped in my head "how" lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thinking about it, I have no clue how @IamKristiKiss was added to my FB. Probably them saying "You have 38 mutual friends"  'Hey, Alright!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse @Fgbrisco You probably told the truth about his son and how shitty Aces and Eights are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nekrosangelo @kvltism at 5am? I was in the middle of 4 hours of sleep. I don't know Lily Allen. Isn't she from Indian Jones?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @Shinedown_Fans, any idea what the #10SongsIn10Days are? Other than 'Nothing Else Matters'.  lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamKristiKiss roflmao....  Hey, fat bitches need lovin' too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Totally just referred to an actor's role and a roll... I'm flagged!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamKristiKiss You should have said so!  I wouldn't have cast the cute blonde we did cast to play a one time roll filming on Saturday! lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamKristiKiss You can come be in our Web Series and then... WE PARTY! haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamKristiKiss I thought you were closer to NYC.  You will be cordially invited. And no wrestling friends to bug you bout 'Stro. WIN! lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamKristiKiss Next time I have a party with free liquor, I'll let you know!  Though the travel to Philly might not be worth it. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamKristiKiss I'd let it go right now, but I work at 9 and you'd probably run off with it after I left my house.... so no! lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealCurtisAxel has the best theme going! Bringing prestige back to the IC Title!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Having a few drinks before working in 3 hours might not be the best, but at least I won't ruin my beard trying to trim it.  #novembeard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nekrosangelo I'd rather have a Sega Game with the WrestleMania game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nekrosangelo a great game is going and getting your money back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley It won't be an IWC technical wet dream. But the story they will tell should be worth it all.  I'll buy if they do a 5x5 tag.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWETheBigShow vs @RandyOrton won't be a technical masterpiece, but those two men will tell a story that CANNOT be missed! #SurvivorSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley But....but... They praise the Punk/Bryan team but won't stop bitching about Show/Orton.  #Catch22 that drives me nuts! lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Saw @HeathSlaterOMRB on a RAW dark match in 2009. Kinda knew he'd be around for a while. Now lets give him some gold @WWE!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darren_h92 @HeathSlaterOMRB @ToysRUs @JinderMahal @TheDrewMcIntyre   Looks like #2MB and 1 Union Jack.  ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley Exactly. "D-Bry is buried"  No moron, they are slow burning his comeuppance for WrestleMania, calm down and enjoy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley The problem with the 'net. Everything is instant and no one can enjoy the slow burn with a character. "Do it now or I complain"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley @TheDamienSandow I laugh at the IWC who complain that he's been 'buried'.  I wish more fans could just be fans and enjoy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder if @mattmccloskey can end this debate. Did he also help with the new  @KiddWWE theme? Sounds a little like "End of Days' for Barret<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finding 8 employees before we open in 7 days isn't impossible, but it's crappy I got this thrown on me by the boss.  #meh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The "Smart ass/Clever" gimmick can NOT work with the World Title.  I still love @TheDamienSandow! Everyone does! @AliceRadley<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I was on WWE commentary, I'd have the monitor under the table showing The Real Ghostbusters cartoon, or Seinfeld!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just chatted with @AliceRadley via twitter (Chat? Really?)  Check out her podcast and go 'stalker' on her pics like I did!  ;) haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley HA!  I have this framed and on my bar, able to be seen as we film Season 2 of Tilted Straits.  AWESOME!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley You know, you want to assume you'll live to 80. Over 3 billion years, that is shorter than the mind can fathom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley I'm 110% on board with that. I do it ALL the time in the PWP group on Facebook.  I'll voice what's on my mind, regardless!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The most exciting thing about a wrestling podcast is when itunes says: "EXPLICIT" Awesome @AliceRadley!  lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley it's the best thing in this world my dear!  I'll never forget that. Hope other don't either!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@indiewire Not much of a shock. I personally could NOT get into it. I'm sure he'll kill it elsewhere though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley Trying to lose some of the round, but never miserable. I'm happy I get to wake up every morning and live how I want. :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley Hey, I'm amazed that all blood work looks like a very healthy guy. There is no issue! "Once you go fat, you won't go back" lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I offered @IamKristiKiss some of my Rum and Vodka.  Fuck, I must have had to much already before dinner.  Only The Flinch gets my booze! lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley That's true. But as a fat man, I can say that I only care about that name: Mello Yello!  lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamKristiKiss blah.  Vodka and Rum please!  I have lots, you can come take it from me. You can only have some! Don't get that wrong! lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley Um, yes.  But with the instagram craze, everyone uses filters that make things look different.  I'll drink it anyways!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley @BurgerKing  I LOVE MELLO YELLO!   #BetterThanDew<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamKristiKiss Sometimes you just need a good cry.  When that happens I hold it back and get drunk instead!  :D  Win/Win. lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>GAH!  FUCK MOVEMBER!   It's fucking Novembeard.   Movember sounds like you got kicked out of your apartment and are trying to move.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamKristiKiss I hope from happiness that you're done working for the day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nekrosangelo I'd imagine you've got at least 6 pages of them by now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Answertheten Sounds like.... BAD NEWS!  (Oh yeah, I went there.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nekrosangelo Nor do I. Last time I got yelled at for touching the giant  Spider-Man statue's nipples.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nekrosangelo Places to NOT find them:  Work.  Internet.  E-Fed. Dungeons and Dragons night at the comic shop.  #GoodLuckBro<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nekrosangelo I find them all the time. Sometimes on Twitter, sometimes on FB. The accent adds to it for me.  meh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hard to believe it's been 8 years!  Keep staying strong @ExcuseMeWWE!  We fans actually do love you!  ;) #VivaLaRaza  #RIPEddie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nekrosangelo "Rock/Punk" chicks from your side of the drink are always so much hotter than in America. #WhyIHateRipper<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@donzig316 @IconJBG  http://t.co/yFgCgtB7ok<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley really soon, I hope! Lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley I wish K8lyn would "submit" like a Bella....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley Ok, Mine is better than his!  I deserve the IC Title just on that fact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donzig316 "Head Cheese" was better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donzig316 As long as he's not in TNA, I'll always be a fan of D'Lo and the head shake. The chest protector was genius<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donzig316 They weren't as good as their manager's T n A<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donzig316 That's true. But at least I had interest in all of those guys...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley @jodijo_vee  Garnier Fructis&gt;Head and Shoulders!  It tastes a little better too.  Win/Win<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jodijo_vee @AliceRadley It's only slightly better than mine, for now!  I'm catching up this Novembeard!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My article will have "Matadores only know how to face #3MB" on it tomorrow.  #RAW  #NapTime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Calling them the Union Jacks doesn't change the fact that @WWELosMatadores have faced #3MB over 19 times this month. #RAW  #stopit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>A walk to the store for a few things before filming, then filming, then more filming, then hoping it's at least 50 out when I'm done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smashley_ashley Good Luck!  Just remember, I'm about to go for a walk and it's 39 degrees right now.  You'll make it!  lol<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse FYI: The IWC are bitches. They want Bryan with the title but still won't buy that shit.  Free Stream because they are fucks!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TrueGodImmortal if Linda is in Daniel Bryan's corner soon, I'm done with wrestling!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrueGodImmortal I just want to see HHH deck Vince, then Big Show knock out HHH. Vince sucks as a good guy though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"@TrueGodImmortal: @RealCrazyBill yeah that's what I mean, HHH in Orton's corner, Vince returns in Show's corner" it WILL happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrueGodImmortal thanks! I don't think we'll see Vince wrestle, but definitely will be in Show's corner at TLC, if not at SSeries<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ryback22 My favorite thing about you is how much you can lift up and down on you.  @HeymanHustle is about 250lbs right? #Impressive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ryback22 My favorite thing about you was your catchphrase: "YEP YEP YEP!" #NXT #CornFedMeatHead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ryback22 My favorite thing about you is how you look like @Goldberg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ryback22 My favorite thing about you is how you can't win when it counts the most, like against @CMPunk for the @WWE Championship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ryback22 My favorite thing about you is that you aren't afraid to wrestle when you have pink eye!  #Dedication<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ryback22 My favorite thing about you is you aren't afraid to show that snaggletooth on national television.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TMZLive Who the fuck is Conrad Murray? #Explain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ryback22 My favorite thing is you aren't ashamed to show off your relationship with @HeymanHustle. It's legal in some states now! #RAW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nekrosangelo @iamtheaj Mid-April.  My sister needs to pay for them going to Vegas on my 30th birthday. #REVENGE SHALL BE MINE!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WWE @WWEInbox R-Truth.  The black guy always dies first. Then AJ because they always kill the slut....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't get why everyone is shocked when a fat person keels over. If I die eating a Whopper meal, people will say:  Yeah, sounds about right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE_Alysa15  oooohhh, yeah... Well I prefer to stay away from demented women.  Sorry.  :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE_Alysa15 Ah, very cool! Though I think Wyatt steals people's souls too lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE_Alysa15 I will!  Going as @WWEBrayWyatt !  What are you being?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@go4biz101 Hmmm, specialist?  Not just yet.... #YET! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I noticed that of all the teenage girl costumes, the least slutty looking one was the prostitute.  #SeemsLegit #TrickOrTreat Happy Halloween<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE_Alysa15 Can I tell you a secret?  I'm going trick or treating tonight.   What? I'm fat and I LOVE free candy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE_Alysa15 I actually gave more candy to teenagers the past few years than little little kids.... lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE_Alysa15 What do I do when someone judges me for doing what I love?  I let them know it's because they are jealous that I love life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE_Alysa15 I went Trick or Tre2ting until I graduated HS, and I still dress up!  :D  #BestHolidayEver<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse  Is #dixieland a cult ranch for marks?  #koolaid #smarks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse why are tna marks the most annoying fucking people to talk to? Always defending that fucking moron, dixie. Drives me insane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HOLLAFAX lol .... mark. She's had it in the death bed for over 4 years now... whatever,  no use arguing with a tna fan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HOLLAFAX @alyhalflatina @TNADixie she sure can.  And wrecking a company they want to sell is on her to do list<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley yikes! Enjoy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceRadley worst thing ever invented.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vince either leg Big Show back in the arena and will lead bryan against HHH, or he is Wyatts devil. Fuck you, pick one or the other #raw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does Wyatt light the lantern, blow it out, then enter the arena with a battery powered fake lantern, then try to blow that out too? #RAW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you think #RAW sucks, or is awesome- you'll still enjoy the Shockmaster Wrecking Ball! #WWE  http://t.co/DYrXudzwWE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I bet @CrankyAsshole would enjoy this one:   http://t.co/DYrXudzwWE :D  You're Welcome!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PennyappleMrs I co-own a web design and Biz2biz company. It's more than I can say on twitters 140. email me, or have them! I'll pm it! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PennyappleMrs lol I got confused by their program as a fake/spam account. took two weeks to get back.FB is lifeline for business tho! lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want to meet @RealPaigeWWE and @ConorOBrian more than any #RAW or #Smackdown superstar!!!  @WWENXT @WWEUniverse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PennyappleMrs After false suspension, I tend to just stick to my facebook pages lol  sometimes Google+<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KickAssWrestlin He's trying!  But with this current storyline, they are keeping him down. Curious to see how he does after finally winning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KickAssWrestlin That's true.  But once it's there the WWE has to put their machine behind it 24/7 to get to a Hogan/Austin/Rock/Cena level<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KickAssWrestlin Well, that's because they haven't bothered to build anyone else up like that.  #SadButTrue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donzig316 Jake Andrews doesn't.  He  captured the Hardcore title so he could retire it. Then used weapons to win the World Title 3 times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/sV0QDHylLR  #StoryOfMyLife dude!  #Cowabunga!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chris Brown was beating up other 10 year old girls in the 90's...  #fun!   https://t.co/sV0QDHylLR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donzig316 That would never work because Jake was blonde hair/blue eyes.  Sometimes with other colors in his hair, but yeah... lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @AvrilLavigne, You do realize you were never 'Rock N Roll' to begin with, right? Go back to the kitchen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm in so much pain today, and NO!  It's not because of #WWEHIAC last night.  #HIAC #RAW #WWE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@midgetsftw I'd be thankful!   They can bring Taylor Swift with them, that way she can write a song about me later and I can be famous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@midgetsftw False! Though maybe both should come over and I can test that theory.... hmmmm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@midgetsftw Of course I watch it.  When I remember it's actually on... Her and Katy Perry are on my list!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@midgetsftw I don't pay attention to most of Elf because I just stare at @ZooeyDeschanel.  She's a beautiful distraction! :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nekrosangelo @midgetsftw  That's true.  But the one I hated the most was my Vet schooled sister being told a cow DOESN'T have 4 stomachs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@midgetsftw Nope!  Not me! I'm to big to be an elf!  And I stopped going to trivia because our write answers always got marked wrong 1/20<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@midgetsftw on a side note, last Decemeber when I argued a pub trivia answer, the host insisted I was just a grumpy elf.... I was right tho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@midgetsftw Please make Sean dress up as one too and send pictures!  :D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWMania Wasn't hard.  So did I....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember when @WWE used to get you excited for a PPV and not just throw 4 random matches on during the show? #HIAC #WWEHellInACell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donzig316 Because he was a racist skinhead portrayed by Ed Norton, the racist skinhead version from AHX.... O.o<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShawnMichaels @WWE I told everyone what was going to happen inside #HIAC three weeks ago, they should have listened and stopped worrying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hallowicked_xo I'm with you on this one most days. Had an MRI? made it worse!  lol   #Hurt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWENXT when will you ever come around Philly, just for one night. Even just two matches...  #Dreaming<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donzig316 Don't let Sean or AJ see that.... it's 'BWA' not BCW!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donzig316 You know who I miss?  'The Myth' Marcus Cooper. He would have been huge if I wasn't focused on Jake Andrews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sorry @SpikeTV!  After finally getting to #JoeSchmo on my DVR, I realized I should have finished it MONTHS ago!  #Season4?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrMainEventBDuB @DezBryant  Pfff... no way that old white guy is any good at the game let alone best wide....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Sunshine48oX Ah, but not everyone cracks jokes about everything. I do it weekly about #RAW on the PWP site with my "6 Things" lol #FunTimes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@noodbsallowed I can do Baltimore Pike to University Ave to CCity, traffic pending, in 15-20 minutes.  22 to @HeliumComedy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sunshine48oX My curiosity, 9 times out of 10, gets replaced by wit and humor. I was curious then I started cracking jokes about the bull<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love when cute girls follow me back on Twitter.  I mean, I am married... but it feels like High School bragging rights! HA! #Pointless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@noodbsallowed Clifton Heights technically, but the post office thinks it's Aldan, Springfield and Primos.  O.o<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sunshine48oX I hear he was only signed to fight Hornswoggle, then they came up with this idea... I'm still certain he's a 4th grader! lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@noodbsallowed I'm in DelCo.  Only a 45 minute drive to those shows. If I was free Nov 2nd, I'd go to that one too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sunshine48oX Yeah, but again El Torito is made to look much more important and favored than Los Matadores.... #SmackDown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@noodbsallowed Just curious.  I'm working on redoing the entire site they have.  It's a great time though!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse you may be a bigger fan-girl than @TNADixie bro!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse you KNOW the entire show would revolve solely on that match. Hart v. McMahon anyone???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse I will happily deny them time on my TV. And if they do WM31 in Philly with that match, I won't go!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse don't you "c'mon" me dude! You should expect my reaction to that horrible idea.... lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PWPowerhouse @HulkHogan @JohnCena not from me. Cena needs help for a good match and Hogan can hardly walk. Fuck 'em!<|endoftext|>
