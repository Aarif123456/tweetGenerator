<|startoftext|>Guess what? The Steelers are overrated! Like people been telling you for the past couple of weeks! Y'all didn't want to believe them after losing to the Washington Football Team and now you finally see against a real team like Buffalo 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 #billsmafia #HereWeGo #PITvsBUF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Iturbide74 @steelers In reality it's finally seeping in finally it's starting to realize that the Steelers were overrated after all😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#PITvsBUF #billsmafia #HereWeGo  Pittsburgh are killing the Dolphins and Patriots chances of winning the AFC East I guess they really are overrated 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#FinsUp #GoPats Patriot fan who likes dolphins when New England plays them next week:  https://t.co/BkESjZ9Qph<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Them raiders can't do anything right 🤦‍♂️ #RaiderNation #ForTheShoe #INDvsLV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ladenheim_mark Bruh  33-27=6   A lot of people  betted on on the chiefs winning by 7 points or more and the Dolphins ruined that with that last field goal at the end making them one point short of the money😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ladenheim_mark *6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@76ripper And the Dolphins ruined that for you by 1 point LOL 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was a fine game it's a shame the Dolphins couldn't get the onside kick at the end but they did their best against the super bowl champs. Well played Miami well played!👏👏👏  #KCvsMIA #FinsUp  #ChiefsKingdom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@76ripper They just didn't get it at the end<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@76ripper That was a strategy take a field goal try to get the ball back through an on-site kick and go for a touchdown. Plus Miami has been one of the teams with the better special teams this year🤷‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ladenheim_mark They wanted to play safe man what can you say it's not guaranteed that a team can get the two point conversion anyways<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man this is a really good game, and here I thought KC was just going to run away with it☺️ Okay Dolphins let's see if you can beat the champs? 🤨 #KCvsMIA #FinsUp #ChiefsKingdom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>wow wow wow dolphins are getting rocked right now  KC 30  Mia 10   #KCvsMIA #FinsUp #ChiefsKingdom  https://t.co/sKpZ9DbFXH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DolFansLA @MiamiDolphins I didn't know dolphins have fans in LA! 🤨  I bet you're happy the Dolphins beat every California team this year 😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess the Dolphins are about to be the Lolphins if Kansas City keeps this up 😂 #KCvsMIA #FinsUp #ChiefsKingdom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>14-10 chiefs starting to shake off that rough start and now they got a four point lead! #KCvsMIA #ChiefsKingdom #FinsUp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@consistentref4 He is for now lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tua's dad ain't going to be happy about that INT😬 #KCvsMIA #ChiefsKingdom #FinsUp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>damn Kansas City's having an awful first half today 😂 Bravo Dolphins Bravo!👏 #KCvsMIA #ChiefsKingdom #FinsUp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DowntownChiefs Don't forget two interceptions!😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally the chiefs score some points. Great run by Tyreek Hill #KCvsMIA #FinsUp #ChiefsKingdom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously Patrick? 😂🤣  #KCvsMIA #finsup #ChiefsKingdom  https://t.co/qpP73IRfmd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unbelievable! 🤯  I thought the ball was dead once I hit the floor but it was ruled a fumble and Western Michigan took advantage of that to make the game winning touchdown while everyone was distracted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How are these chiefs letting this happen to themain't child supposed to be the favorites in this ? 🤣 Good job Miami 👍 #KCvsMIA #finsup #ChiefsKingdom<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LilThanosX Well not exactly if Pennsylvania finishes with blue its GG. Arizona still counting votes despite it being called for Joe but the other new stations pulled it back, so that means if he gets Georgia it's going to be 269 and if Trump ends up winning the other states he gets 269 Too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TinoAyee @sotelo_0120 @Mr_Liberty1 Yeah by 900 some votes that's still within 0.5-1% , wich could lead to more time wasted on a recount, and there still plenty of votes to be counted. Remember all votes matters!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AlexDeBrincats Joe may have the lead but Donald is inside the 1% margin of votes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Berry_Brown102 @WisVoter Arizona was pulled back? I thought it went to Joe already?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cerebrum01 @Beefstr @egod3fault @IlhanMN @realDonaldTrump Well those states have already been counted for by the local news stations in their respective States but the major news networks didn't call anything for Florida or Texas during the night<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jkhot_ Florida went to Trump again it was been called for a long ago but the other news stations didn't call it yesterday except for the local news stations in those Florida counties<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@looking4memes_ @egod3fault @cerebrum01 @IlhanMN @realDonaldTrump Look I'm just as shocked as you are that this guy is still in this race, but you gotta keep a cool head you and take the results for what it is. You feel me?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Krantivarya @CNN Mainstream media!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cerebrum01 @IlhanMN @realDonaldTrump They've already been called for<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsrobert_4 How? They always vote red whether you like it or not. They're not a true swing state like the polls want you to believe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simplychriss_ Well your prayer wasn't answered. Texas and Florida are now under Trump's belt<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KudaMenace @svnbads @_akiraco @AbelUnderwater Kids right it might flip. This early lead is not guaranteed to last once it reaches 91-98%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jkhot_ nah Texas has been red for decades and ain't going blue homie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zeemdead @_Captain_A_ What? Miami-Dade and Broward  can only do so much. Once again most of the votes for Joe Biden came from those two counties, and the ones for Trump  in MDC/BC omes from the Latino community<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CC_Robinson1 Tell that to the Latino community there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simplychriss_ I'm looking at this map and it's a long shot now for dems cuz Trump's extending the lead in Texas and extending the lead a little bit more in Florida just a little bit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffLastMashipe @jahman_adamski So does Ohio<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mbloh436 @pigpen7877 @voxdotcom Well this is an age well. Trump is literally about to win Florida LOL<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Marlins Miami marlins are just depressing season after season. A bunch of overpaid losers. At least with the Florida Marlins they've got titles to their name but now "Florida Marlins" name is replaced by "Miami Marlins" in history books I suppose 😒  https://t.co/JLsE0bs2JS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nba_shitpost @BrewCrewMegan Heat in 5  giannis might try to pull something to get the bucks one win. Originally I thought it was going to be heat in 6 before Antetokounmpo started missing shots and choking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BabyBenz777 Comedy gold 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SanneyLeung Debatable?  That's not a foul. Goran didn't put his hands on Middleton unlike Giannis who clearly puts a hand on Butler 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darthffej @MiamiHEAT Plus we shouldn'tbe bringing bad omens to this playoff Heat team<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darthffej @MiamiHEAT Careful with that "trust the process" rhetoric it didn't work out for Philly  😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even if Donovan Mitchell wasn't super wide open you can still give it to him. He would've had enough space to pull up a shot with a good look at the basket since he broke the record for the most threes in a playoff series while shooting 52% from 3 Like Come On Man! 🤔🥴😒🤦‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Jazz must be blind. Like what was stopping the them from passing it to a wide open Donovan Mitchell? Who was in the perfect position to make up for that turnover the  play before?🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doesn't change the fact that Donovan Mitchell and his team choked. Dude was standing on the other end wide open with his hands up waiting for someone to pass him the ball,  but instead they let someone else take a bad final shot attempt. I don't care if "it almost went in"  🤦‍♂️<|endoftext|>
