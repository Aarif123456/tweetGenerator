<|startoftext|>@WorldofOutlaws @KyleLarsonRacin needs to miss actual races.  Conduct-unbecoming violators in other sports miss games.

<|startoftext|>@FantasyRace Yeah, there's definitely bad blood there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FantasyRace Well, look at it this way, with @KyleBusch letting @dennyhamlin win, it screws @joeylogano out of the @NASCAR #Championship4 and I bet Kyle's happy about that. 😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steveluvender @dennyhamlin Would make for a great birthday party for @dennyhamlin.  Also, happy early 30th birthday, Steve.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FantasyRace Meaning, if @dennyhamlin and @KyleBusch are battling for the lead, will @JoeGibbsRacing tell Kyle to finish 2nd?  Yes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@adambombshow @NiallOfficial @Q997Atlanta 🍌 Ask him what he does with the banana sticker and if he'd consider covering #EveryTimeIThinkOfYou by #TheBabys (@TweetTheBabys). Thanks. 😊 https://t.co/9641XckBn7<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I loathe when artists/bands do multiple buzz singles, before an album drop. They've taken the beauty &amp; art &amp; fun &amp; anticipation out of listening to a brand new album on release day, which is the closest I get to a religious experience, besides a concert. #MusicMonday #NewMusic  https://t.co/7H4bpsZVCK<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FantasyRace @KyleBusch Definitely a lot of luck!  Yeah, I picked @KyleBusch to win the #NASCARPlayoffs, so, if he DOESN'T &amp; I lose bc of the 60 pt. bonus, I'll be😡.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FantasyRace Cool. I've got 6062 pts., 854th overall &amp; 1st in my 50-person league. This is the best I've ever done. Takes time studying all those stats tho...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JennaFryer @jeff_gluck @NASCAR All of these #NASCAR races are too damn long. 2 to 3 hours every race would be perfect. Nothing needs to be longer than a concert or an @NFL game, except the #Daytona500 (@DISupdates) and the #Indy500 (@IndyCar/@IMS).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm actually more offended at the many male musicians I see retweeting disparaging comments about @TheRyanAdams on my timeline, when they didn't seem to mind making $ working with him. Where was your outrage then, if "none of this surprises you" now? #MeToo (2/2)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listen, @TheRyanAdams has always been a moody bitch, AT BEST, &amp; I certainly don't condone his conduct, but I do agree that a musician is a person who plays a musical instrument, bc THAT'S THE LITERAL DEFINITION OF A MUSICIAN, (&amp; a pet peeve of mine).  https://t.co/ZFLdNnVoKC (1/2)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Y'all, tell me this ain't the exact same melody for @HERMusicx's #HardPlace and #BlackeyedSusan's #NoneOfItMatters. #GRAMMYs #Grammy2019 #GrammyAwards  Also, I just learned how to edit two separate videos together. #SoNOTTechSavvy  https://t.co/mxqt5KrsiN<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Tonight is my first time hearing @HERMusicx's #HardPlace, but, y'all, that's a ripoff of #NoneOfItMatters by #BlackeyedSusan. She owes Dizzy #DeanDavidson some cash money. #GRAMMYs #Grammy2019 #GrammyAwards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is exactly why the @RecordingAcad has lost its relevancy and viewership. The #Grammy2019 opening number is a song released in 2017. Way to stay boring, safe, and never cutting edge, #GRAMMYs.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Not only am I reviewing @onedirection's #MadeInTheAM, now I'm covering the Chicago #1DFirstListen party. If a weirdo asks U ?s, it's me. 😊<|endoftext|>
