<|startoftext|>@stillcmark @CBCCanada @CBCAlerts I didn't hear anywhere in what he said that he hates women.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NigelSBrown @CBCCanada @CBCAlerts what do his comments have to do with the job he does. Try actually listening to what he said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MerlinSkis @CBCCanada maybe you are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBCCanada I heard what he said. He did not say that being a person who sexually harasses others is part of our biology.  Report the truth.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Christine Allan:  http://t.co/V6QuoP2V via @AddThis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am going to create a piece of art that represents my feelings for the media<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's funny, how some people don't seem to understand that in order to be an artist, you need time to create art.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In my opinion, there is nothing civil about civil libertarians.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would rather live in a country where the police have the upper hand than have the anarchists take over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andersoncooper these are all the reasons we need to monitor the internet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Show opens tonight...very excited. See my website to see new pieces that are in the  http://t.co/VqY9oskl<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I want the police to be left alone so they can do their jobs, so that I can feel safe to be an artist and a mom.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Today I am angry at hearing negative comments about the police. My husband has to deal with the backlash of negative media every day @ work<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really hope that people don't believe everything they see in the media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Art work set up yesterday at the Chemainus Theatre Gallery. Show starts Feb 24th.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theprovince I didn't see my pro-police letter to the province. I guess you only print anti-police stories<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>happy valentines day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll try not to talk about the media's take on police while I am getting ready for my next art show.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every newspaper should read the Dear Osoyoos Times article<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear Osoyoos Times Editor:  http://t.co/SV91WHhF via @AddThis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am not anti-media, i am pro-police<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's my rant for the day. I am going back to my artwork now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congratulations to all the policeman who go out and do the hard work of dealing with people who believe that the law doesn't apply to them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When I say "the media" did this or that, I say that because the media says "the police" did this or that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mike_Killeen BCTV news should not advertise that they care about the people when they don't care about "all" the people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching the news is like looking at a bad accident. You know it is wrong but can't help but look anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are a lot more criminals than there are policemen, so why would the media want to give the criminals the upper hand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Being an artist helps take the sting out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does the media know that they hurt people when they report stories that don't tell the 'whole' truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Working at the theatre tonight. Support all of the arts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love Zoomer magazine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had a request today to donate a piece of art for the  http://t.co/XMCQRUnB to raise awareness and funds for Chrone's Disease. Happy to do so!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Help definitely deserved to win the SAG award<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Having to call the police on your teenager does not make you bad parent. There are so many outside influences that effect teenagers today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Christine Allan:  http://t.co/Crl4CTZ4 via @AddThis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is the media teaching our children? ...that the police are bad and the bad guys are victims. What is wrong with this picture.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some women just prefer men friends because they have more in common with them. That doesn't mean they are gay or damamged.@LiveKelly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow, I think the guy from the Bachelor just insulted a lot of women today. @LiveKelly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are surrounded by art and children and yet parenting and being an artist are the least recognized roles on the planet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ART is everywhere we look.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finding out that doing what you do has had a positive effect on someone else makes it all worthwhile.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You will be happier if you do not expect other people to act a certain way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can anyone tell me why I get notifications that someone is following me, but they are not in my followers list?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People who complain about what other people do and don't just get on with thier own lives are their own worst enemies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I plan on staying happy for the rest of my life@gehealthy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kirstiealley ...that goes for the Canadian govt as well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now that the decorations are down and the house sort of tidy, it is time to get into creating some more art.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you think it will be a good year then it will be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please remember all the police officers and other emergency workers who will still be working and away from thier families on Christmas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My daughter and I met Michael Buble in the mall today. What a nice and real guy. Merry Christmas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am tired of people acting like victims when it is up to them to make the best of thier lives, not someone else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Michael Buble should be the next co-host with you Kelly. He is very funny, and would be awesome with you. From a fellow Canadian @LiveKelly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes we are in a bad place. The only person who can get us out is ourselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Negative publicity of the police is giving self proclaimed "Freemen" fuel to break the law and assault police officers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes I just want to scream, but then I will just give myself a headache.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We all want to be millionaires, but wishing it won't make it happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our mind is the most important tool we have for health, wealth, & happiness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today is a good day. I sold a piece of artwork to a very nice man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes in marriage, you have to look past the dirty fighting and see what the real issue is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The key to health and weight loss is how you think about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you are tired, be thankful you aren't sick, and if you are sick and tired be thankful you are not terminal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cancer helped me to appreciate my life...just the way it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I believe that part of the reason I beat cancer is because I believed I could.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Along with all the good stuff in life comes crappy stuff. If you try and think only about the good stuff, you will be happier.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The RCMP in Canada are not the same as American Campus police...and those people were probably warned first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All the media accomplishes by dragging the police through the mud, is giving the criminals more power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would rather have a police force with a few flaws than not have one at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happiness is a state of mind...not a personality trait.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Money doesn't necessarily make us happy, it can just give us more things to worry about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think happy thoughts and you will have a happy life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just saw Squire Barnes on Ellen. Congratulations. See you at the horse races.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What we don't see on the news is what the 'supposed' victim of police brutality did prior to that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happiness is the key to success...really!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OccupyToronto Go ahead and criticize, but remember your opinion isn't more important than someone else's and, camping out is not assembling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CTVBC Go home and let the rest of us enjoy the Art Gallery<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To the 99% - Take a pole and see how many people think you should leave?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The participants of occupy Vancouver et. al. are nothing more than unemployed squatters who do not have a grasp on how the real world works.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is really going on with you and Demi anyway? I am 8 years older than my husband and it has been an issue at times.@aplusk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you want to be happy...then just be happy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is anybody else wondering if the stories about Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher are just a publicity stunt?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I actually liked her dress...   http://t.co/FRwq9wuY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>hello from one of your distant relatives on the west coast. My name is Christine Allan (neeHardacker) @LoisAdair<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This art piece titled "The Morning After" sold at auction at an RCMP Ball to raise funds for Cops for Cancer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some of my art is now on display at Averill Creek Winery for the 2012 Wine Festival.  http://t.co/G7157i30<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The media and misinformation on the internet encourages anti-government and anti-law groups like the freeman to spread thier stupidity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you have a problem with police --- then don't break the law.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am really annoyed at people who blame everyone but themselves for all of thier problems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am very sorry to hear of the death of Jack Layton. We need to find out the cause of cancer, not just the cure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All of the young people rioting around the world should get thier facts straight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My art will be on display at Just Jakes Restaurant in Duncan, BC from Aug. 7 - Sept. 11<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kids learn alot more from watching us than we could ever hope to teach them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do some people think it is a good idea to send everyone in thier email contacts all of the jokes and things they find interesting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just because something is on the news doesn't mean it is true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember you can't believe what you see in the media as truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Busy painting...it is not what you do, but how you feel when you do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Abbotsford Police Department is hailing 7 heroes who put their lives at risk to save an officer during the Stanley Cup riot in Vancouver."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Canadian justice system doesn't support the hard work that the police do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CTV news seems determined to run the RCMP through the mud. A couple of bad apples doesn't make the whole barrel rotten.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Support the police. You don't have to like them personally but you do have to respect what they do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some days I can tweet like a bird, other days I feel like I am being eaten by a cat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today I am angry with people who have children and then put thier own selfish needs ahead of thier childrens'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vancouver police, the RCMP and all other local police forces deserve our respect for always going above and beyond the call of duty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Media is being willfully ignorant if they don't see that some people are influenced by the negative impression media creates of the police<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do we want Canada to be home of the brave or home of the stupid?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Canadians don't want the anarchists to take over, we all have to work together to change the justice system and support the police.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There were 3 reasons for the riot in Vancouver, negative media of the police, a lax justice system, and bad parenting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG Vancouver on the view for a riot. I am even more dissappointed in the lack of respect for the police in Canada.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congratulations to the police in last nights riot for not reacting to the taunts of stupid people that would garner negative media attention<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The people who have been shown in the media who claim to be treated badly by the police are not exactly law abiding citizens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We need the police, and they need to be able to do their jobs without being constantly held under a microscope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I won't stop criticizing the media until they stop finding fault with the police.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is how every police officer and their families feel every time the police are criticized by the media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rob Brown got a taste of how it feels to be criticized as part of group instead of being appreciated for what he does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last night should be a wake up call for all of us, that we need to show more support for the police.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was obvious last night that people were taunting the police to get them to react so that they media could show them in a bad light.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The police loose their power when the media is constantly finding fault with them doing thier jobs, which is to keep us safe from idiots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, Rob did a great job last night of reporting the riot, but past negative portrayals of the police are fuel for these rioting idiots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In response to Rob Brown on the radio this morning. I take umbrage to him taking umbrage with people saying the media are partly responsible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Skytrain is running. Walking works too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Negative media is just fuel for the anti-police groups who instigate these types of riots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The disrespect for the police, public property, and the law is shameful. The police are showing amazing restraint.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No matter how the police handle a situation, somebody manages to find fault.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The group of people who started the Vancouver riot are not hockey fans, they are lawless fools who are taunting the police.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Way to go to the Vancouver Police for handling the idiot rioters so well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would those who criticize the police rather live without them? I don't think so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't parents have a responsibility to their children to try and stay together and work out thier problems rather than get a divorce?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hats off to the RCMP members who lost their homes in the Slave Lake fire, but keep on working to keep others safe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A twitter a day helps keep anxiety away!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's celebrate the hard work the police do today and everyday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RCMP in Canada keep our communities safe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It would make me really happy if young people had more respect for the law. Negative media doesn't help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Canada needs to support the police before the criminals take over! www.chrisallanartgallery.com<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am so disappointed in the Canadian Legal system. Who are the bad guys anyway? www.chrisallanartgallery.com<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So it is National Law Enforcement month in the U.S., while Canada continues to slam the police every chance they get. Not impressed!<|endoftext|>
