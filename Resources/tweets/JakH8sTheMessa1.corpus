Ain't nobody wants to watch a rambling old fool repeating lies we all heard for 8 years when 0 had the reins... it didn't see HRC win either.  #TrumpRally is a poll.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Here's #LyingBiden saying fracking is toast... he said the same about oil tonite at the #Debates2020   He blamed #LaptopHell on Vlad... 🤔 so Hunter was a foreign agent... &amp; deets seen say you were getting a cut &amp; were one too.  #bobulinsky said #China paid up too.  #NWOPuppetJoe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>💯👍#TrumpWonTheDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BeijingBiden claims he's gonna close the oil industry in addition to his 4T in new taxes... we're all gonna be in the dark like CA at that rate.

<|startoftext|>Joe just looked at his watch. He's getting #REKT at tonite's #Debate2020   He's pleading for mercy &amp; blaming Vlad for making Hunter take his laptop in to get fixed.  #BidenPolicy is history while #Trump's is the future.  The #Donkey Party got slayed for running a #Chinese puppet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FascistTwatter @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden 💯 for sure the 0 years were that for a reason... NO return.  Biden is an economic illiterate... in addition to being a moron.  4T in taxes Joe wants ensures it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealBobbyDMAGA 🤣🤣🤣 the predebate warmup act proved that wrong as did #HuntersLaptop   #BeijingBiden is getting #REKT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤣🤣🤣 @JoeBiden gets called the "Big Guy" by #Trump but it's Russian Disinformation that's already been debunked... #BidenIsCompromised Vlad made him take bribes just like Xi.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes it is... 🤣🤣🤣   2 terms for #Trump 🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤣🤣🤣 we've got a warmup presser... a witness to Beijing Biden's criminality... the debate is gonna be LIT tonite. 👀 the "Big Guy" try to lie his way thru this is gonna be hilarious.   #BeijingBiden quotes from Mao's Red Book tonite.  #LaptopHell #Debates2020 #Debate2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This fuk'n activist's own network broke the story an hour ago based on his own tweet... now the #FakeNews 🤡 tries to dispute that reporting.  Definitely not Field Officer material.  This has already been debunked by the alphabet agencies idiot.  #BidenCrimeFamily #China docs 2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤔 I wonder if this revelation came to them via #Trump 60 min tweet... he knows how these activists work to hide the criminal party.  Tomorrow is #ChinaKickbackDay on doc drops... the Big Guy will be hiding having called a lid... we see the DNC has already activated  #RedAlert 💥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daze_sc Paul Ryan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did anyone else find it odd that @FBN gave @KennedyNation back her show; so she could trot out the Libertarian candidate 2 weeks before the election? 🤔  Helping #HidenBiden out... he's had such a bad week &amp; is now in #Lockdown while she tries to siphon votes for nobodies choice.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mercy4daweak Go figure Epstein gave them an island to hide their debauchery... now that HRC killed him... they're all grabbing it publicly like Joe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReduxVernon Way too much blu koolade been handed out by Joe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another example of a violent leftist backstabber. Unpersoning is her ultimate level of contempt.

<|startoftext|>Well odds are 100% that you singlehandedly destroyed the #Enron case... you tried to do the same while on the #WitchHunt SC.

<|startoftext|>💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤣🤣🤣 kept waiting for it to go BOOM 💥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReduxVernon Odd, someone "speaking" for a Tech corp sould know the difference, but #Censorship &amp; "word games" proves they don't.

<|startoftext|>Yep #HuntersEmails confirm Joe's up to his eyeballs in this crime.  Yet the #propaganda activists in the media keep silent on #HidenBiden criminality.  #EnemyOfThePeople<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We also 👀 @jack &amp; @Twitter get ANGRY too.  #Censorship proves they're a "publisher"; so #Section230 protections no longer apply.

<|startoftext|>@jsolomonReports @MAGAPILL Probably why he picked #HeelsUpHarris to run on the #BigotTicket   Her tenure as CA AG was highlighted by the high number of minority incarcerations tied to drugs... &amp; the #BidenCrimeBill he pushed thru the Senate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dawnbuesing @paulsperry_ It wouldn't surprise me... he's neither a law enforcement nor gun safety expert who only wishes the gun confiscation to begin. #2A<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TwitterSupport Sure ya did... for being a "tech" company you suck badly at it. That your immediate response was we weren't hacked... an indication you likely were or needed an "excuse" to scrub what you didn't want subpeonas to find.

<|startoftext|>@Vader0577 🤣🤣🤣 fuk PR... he was a garbage Speaker who singlehandedly flipped the House in '18. He should be sent to CNN or MSLSD instead. FUX has many problems... as he pushes them to become #FakeNews   The "establishment" knows #HidenBiden isn't leading as well.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RichardGrenell #HidenBuden got caught trying to lie about it so it could be claimed as debunked instead of fact.  We already saw him admit to being the cause for the firing of the  prosecutor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@45Wildwayne Guessing it's who kicked Harry's ass... the excersise band "accident" looks more like a "do what we asked" or there won't be a "next" time. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>which is why*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#HidenBiden wishes the masses remain ignorant... indoctrination isn't education which is they try to deny charter schools at every turn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet Odd... the WHO just said lockdowns are BAD. Seems Bill is "in it" for Bill, not the rest of us.  How the #ChineseVirus hype hides a .5% fatality rate unless you've exceeded your life expectancy. 🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is why the government is NOT our keeper... the "experts" have been wrong since Day 1 on the #ChineseVirus Xi unleashed with their help &amp; that of tyrants who did their best to target populations who couldn't protect themselves.  #FreedomSavesLives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Judiciary libs are playing policy politics once again instead of citing a single reason not to #ConfirmACB   #SCOTUShearing devolves into fantasy narratives that claim apocalyptic events will transpire if they don't get their way.   #FillTheSeat &amp; #Trump2020 we want more than 3.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BobbyDMAGA 🤔 so yoga &amp; wedding plans were sent to State peeps? Not buying that... she's not gonna send her crimes to others... it why they were deleted in the first place.

<|startoftext|>@paulsperry_ He was in the Oval w/0, he's already a co-conspirator... &amp; unmasked #GenFlynn too.  Yet Barr claimed no investigation of candidates... is that why the DNC made him the nom? Seems likely.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MaybeAmes You can't fix stupid, even when you explain it to them.  She got massacred last nite which is why they distract to a "fly"; so they don't need to admit it.

<|startoftext|>@usmc_aviation @Marine0141 @RogueFather Yep, I spent a year &amp; half at PI processing enlistment waivers; so saw the correspondence between HQMC &amp; recruiters on the subject.

<|startoftext|>Sounds like a @realDonaldTrump plan to me... 🤣🤣🤣  They'd be #MadOnline for a millennia if that were to happen &amp; a beautiful sight to behold. 🙏  #CrushTheEnemy #DeclassifyEverything 💥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NahBabyNah 🤔 so #Leadfoot claims criminal activity is just freedom?  Odd, why did she deny that freedom when they got close to her house?

<|startoftext|>@alexwalker2020 Can we get a statement from @TimScottSC on Dikhead Durbin's racist comment about him?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DickDurbin Sure 🤡 what exactly have you done to eliminate the racist deaths in Chicago? We already heard you call an African-American a "token" in the Senate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chiIIum Looks like a prayer to the God Mercury...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@loudog112 @chiIIum Yep I wonder if Tammy Wynette is gonna show up too... guessing the number of Chardonnay bottles smashed last nite was of epic proportions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chiIIum They heard WJC was wetting his willy on pedo island? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So he's replaced Rev Wright now... &amp; is still nothing more than a big 0.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RebelSmith626 Well the cost of meds is a function of the insurance industry... patients normally only have a small co-pay... fuk'n activist would rather see #China deny meds making them unavailable for this or their next #bioweapon   #EnemyOfThePeople<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@John_tb @SenBlumenthal 😭😭😭 forced to explain?... the judge was told to dismiss with 3 of them &amp; that case hasn't changed 🤡  Fuk'n lib diots ain't gotta clue what is even happening... just like Joe.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FuctupMike No way it will take that long, but the judge seems set on stretching it as long as possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaybeAmes Dumb fuks caused these "flareups" via their lockdown orders... keep peeps hidden; so when they emerge they have 0 protection... all of it should have ended in March, but they keep stringing it out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fuctmind @dfal182 All the judges hear the case instead of just 3... I expect the same outcome... DC delays again... seems intentional.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chiIIum Being the bagman for the DNC should always come with a concern.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@THEHermanCain 🙏🔩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaybeAmes Leadership determines legislation... it wasn't #MAGA or #AmericaFirst  but I agree, he had useless idiots helping ensure the status quo was maintained. The Ryan agenda isn't what we voted for... but it's what we got given the 60 vote Senate threshold.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaybeAmes Gonna be hard to claim it didn't kill him now... 😭😭😭 #TrollMaster 🏆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaybeAmes Well I'm going with Paul Ryan for $100 on why so little was accomplished.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaybeAmes @SadPuppy15 Ah... the Party is NOT with us... they never were. They are the establishment trying to usher in the end of the #TrumpEra so they can get back to selling us out once again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaybeAmes @Jim_Jordan Odd 'cus that CEO didn't promise NOT to interfere in elections... he promised to follow his "code".  Ask Egypt how that turned out...  thanks Jim... you didn't "challenge" his statement... or Cook's praise of Huawei either. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr Tie the funds to the child... let the union pay the "strikers" NOT the taxpayer. Those that work get paid... simple econ policy. Charter schools have better results anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RebelSmith626 Funds following the child threatens the academic indoctrination policy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@45Wildwayne Well taking Vlad cash &amp; hanging out by the raycis cooler to chat on Billy's dingy isn't much of a job... 🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealDeanCain @mary122514 @jack B'cus they'll use whatever source needed to justify fascism... we left the #WHO for their intentionally corrupt response to a #bioweapon that was unleashed on the 🌎 by #China   Revoke section 230 now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealEricCarmen They don't want us to survive their apocalypse b'cus over 99.8% do...  if they made it readily available the number would be near 100% with NO need for a "vaccine".<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MistaBRONCO 🤔 Reb celebrating his recent winning streak?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chiIIum A day of finger waving at tech censors... while they claimed they were good.  Odd @Google dude when asked if he promised not to meddle in the election... said he wouldn't violate their "code"... we recall what happened to Egypt, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@T_S_P_O_O_K_Y Watch the Bernie bros step in... they are members of #pantifa anyway... the place is gonna be a #DumpsterFire of #HideTheNom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaybeAmes I tell you they want to ensure Doc #Fukup gets a chance to infect everyone. Watch the money... the one they're censoring has been around for decades &amp; costs under $20.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You first 🤡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watch Doc Fukup is gonna claim everybody is gonna need a ventilator before he's done killing us.  His numbers gotta be bigger than the #NursingHomeMurders at this rate... he gets credit for all the suicides seen due to his #plandemic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealBasedMAGA 15 days for their broken curve has morphed into a litany of insane excuses on why we're done listening to non-experts. #MaskFree   Tell this 🤡 to stop "pitching" we saw him miss homeplate by a mile.  #FukOffFauci<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😭😭😭 this 🤡 continues to prove he's NOT capable of running the Country 🇺🇸  That's "assisted living" care for all to see.  You know the #Marxists are desperate for even choosing Joe to be their "face".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shem_Infinite 230 should be the number of the day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealBobbyDTrump I reclaim my time... was the phrase of the day in DC yesterday.  The activists in the House didn't want to hear from the AG... seems odd given the fact they "demanded" his attendance. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VegasJt @60sReno Don't forget they "extorted" millions from corps as well to fund the activities of radicals intent on destruction. #Marxists<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Apple CEO just praised #Huawei in DC... Tim Cook must appreciate the profit in stolen technology.  #TechHearings show themselves as #Globalist #Tyrants running monopolies... they will NOT surrender dominance willingly.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SaraCarterDC @GordonGChang It's only one reason all pharma should be domestically sourced.  We didn't just catch the #ChineseVirus it was sent... Modi should note the act... border skirmish is proof that more conflict is coming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaybeAmes Some peeps recall her escorting illegals across the border too.  She's a worthless CA #Commie   Riots aren't protected by the Constitution... she tries to "disappear" 60 days like she's #China<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaybeAmes @ennykinpa Well they've done a great job at indoctrination... they can make up cures for nonexistent diseases to prove socialized medicine is a resounding success too. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No 🤡 you agreed to protect Federal property you lying moron.  I hope the business owners in #PortlandProtests demand the same protection.   Violence isn't a protest, but unlawful assembly.   #pantifa are #DomesticTerrorists<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BraveandFiesty @IngrahamAngle Sure 🤡 Portland is your "sign".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaybeAmes @OANN Good, he can get the antibodies needed for immunity... the apocalypse we keep hearing about isn't occurring... fuk'n 🤡s<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@T_S_P_O_O_K_Y Consequences NOT seen in decades coming home to roost in Germany. Seems 6K may be returning home &amp; doing unit rotations. Now they can pick up the slack for refusing to fund defense as required. Poland a much better partner these days... I hope they can finalize that agreement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DHS_Wolf Odd... they should have done that day 1... but refused... so now they do it to ensure the Feds leave.  State 🤡s forced to act instead of allowing insurrection to go unchecked.  Props to the Team for maintaining order. 👍🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good, they've shown themselves to be more concerned with the liberal State than defense... let them pick up the slack for leaving troops. I hope the trend continues in the future. 🇺🇸  "US will pull nearly 12,000 troops out of Germany"   https://t.co/hKNRnLssE6<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RubyRockstar333 @DonaldJTrumpJr Odd a public statement was made... but it must be censored to appease? 🤔 ... WHO?  Repeating it the claim used to ensure that tyranny isn't questioned. End to #COVID19 op... &amp; paragraph 230.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😭😭😭 the Penguin is on a rant... he intends to impeach Barr to hide crimes... that wreck must have shook him up &amp; these marbles haven't yet returned to rest.  #BarrHearing<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chiIIum @chicagosmayor @realDonaldTrump Yep she is the one terrorizing residents. Abdicating her responsibilities she incites the lawlessness &amp; violence while insisting they're peaceful.  DJT is sending officers &amp; doesn't need her permission to do so.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheLastVern Got no prob w/that, but Mayors refuse to. Just like Govs. refuse to call in Nat Guard to counter these Mayors inciting lawlessness in their communities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It ENDs @MLB 👋<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheLastVern Hmm... the Nat Guard is absent... the military has been used to put down insurrection before.   When Rights are denied is the political structure cited adhering to its enumerated duties? NO  #Rioting isn't enshrined in the Constitution ONLY peaceful assembly is.  #Sedition 👌<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realTRUMPERLAND @LeeRobin19 You know that's NOT true... I'm not a fan of the charade just tweeted either... is @realDonaldTrump listening to Jared again or taking the "pulse" of #MAGA to determine what needs to be done?  #OPENAMERICANOW #MaskFree<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RebelSmith626 Public Health doesn't trump the Constitution. Business owners should be joining forces to drag the #Tyrants to court to end their powergrab.  #Communism a piece at a time doesn't work any better than when it fails through revolution.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imagine the @NBA or this 🤡criticizing #China for acts of genocide instead of continuing to whine about the act of a single person who's already been charged for his crime. You do realize the 130K #ChineseVirus deaths here was also caused by Xi too, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RebelSmith626 That is #Communism the Government "owns" the means of production through those unlawful edicts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Nah, NOT kneeling to man to wear a mask for the #ChineseVirus   Patriotic would be lifting all restrictions forcing us to remain "closed".  The only weapon against it is antibodies NOT trying to hide from it.  Over 99.8% recovery rate shows it's neither apocalyptic nor a pandemic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ravagiing It also should make them targets for financial retribution from Treasury for the act.   It may also make it easier to hack them as Huawei is looking for peeps to buy their stolen garbage.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>A number of "Security" protocols seem to be missing from Twitter...  Identity Management-failed System Tools-failed  perhaps I should "read" their site post, but if it's full of the fluff I've seen thus far it's more lawyer speak &amp; NOT an info dump on obvious protocol failures.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The admin account accessed internal systems... how did they know where they were accessed from? i.e. a URL was provided or a client was installed to provide functionality for what was seen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How do they verify the person is who they claim to be?  The perpetrators were "given" an admin account; so did the insider hand them theirs or were they given someone else's?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've still seen little to explain how the id(s) were acquired... "social engineering" isn't the same as an "insider attack". Changing a "notify email" on accounts to execute a password reset to gain "control" seems to hide from "security" question/response verification.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So they've admitted to compromised credentials that accessed internal systems with full autonomy to do whatever they chose to do. A logging mechanism should exist that showed the id(s) utilized &amp; they likely deactivated those id(s) to end the intrusion.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So the "Smoking gun" of the #DeepState shows up again to "rig" #ChineseVirus numbers that inferred an impending disaster while we watched deaths steadily decline.

<|startoftext|>@SebGorka 🤔 he's been silent for hours... he's trying to come up with a way to spin his lack of "controls" or why he can take control of accounts to create content.

<|startoftext|>@JessieJaneDuff Well not sure, but here's what was claimed... &amp; I've been posting about... their story doesn't pass muster yet.   https://t.co/3lVg6v58zU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AughraObserves @Ravagiing @jack Odd he's had no further comment for a security breach... conflicting info about whether it was an "insider attack" vs. a "spear phishing attack".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AughraObserves @Ravagiing @jack Nah there was a lock on it... all the other blucucks didn't do that... for Jack's "hack".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ravagiing She deleted a whole bunch of what appeared to be tweets about pedo acts. Was getting #REKT so hard she claimed to have blocked 1M &amp; then protected her account; so only follows could see her garbage rants.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shem_Infinite Expect they knew it was too high profile... this story appears to be fluid... a "paid" insider vs. a hack<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jason_koebler Odd that contradicts @jack statement about social engineering...   Insider &amp; Social Enginerring aren't the same thing... the first is wilful acts by some one authorized the second is not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shem_Infinite 1st- admitting a spear phishing attack... they also provided them with details on how to access internal systems.  2nd- admits admin can create content on your account for some reason. They also aren't sure of everything that may have occurred.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is the solution allowing the admin to tweet on the behalf of anyone?  Only the user should be creating content for their account.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So he's admitting to a spear phishing attack... same thing Podesta did.  They were also given details on how to access the system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FuctupMike Yep... his security protocols found wanting... odd they created content... no admin should be able to do that... how many can now demand accounts back using the I never posted that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jack66123366 @dochartdc 🤔 a hack &amp; theft isn't an indicator of good intentions in this case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dochartdc I said Xi earlier... so #China would be my suspect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So they were hacked... NOT a good look.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimRunsHisMouth Their data center was shitting bricks... bank on it. Betting somebody is getting called on the carpet too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shem_Infinite In a web environment multiple servers exist where traffic can be routed to access functionality... they can stop sending traffic to a given server, reboot it, &amp; then return it to service... cascade through all your servers &amp; no one is the wiser<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JessieJaneDuff The last 2-3 hours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zerohedge So the DB is using the admin pw too? 🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hey @GregAbbott_TX you're looking like a total moron based on the numbers from the State you run.  1/100th of a percent chance to die... if that's the "standard" many other things should "disappear" from society as their numbers are factors higher.  #OpenAmericaNow #MaskFree<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I guess this 0 flunky tried to have a convo with Joe.  Thanks for confirming what the rest of us already knew.  👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chiIIum 😭😭😭 she still hasn't given a concession speech either.  We're gonna re-elect #Trump; so that #ChardonnayDrunk is gonna be shown wrong once again.  #PerpetualLoser<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Insight from the Land of Makebelieve fill her TL...   #SelfawareLevel0   😭😭😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The 🤡 who created his own Nursing Home deathcamps claims #Trump doesn't get it.  @NYGovCuomo you intentionally filled thousands of bodybags... you can pound sand 'cus that record should see you facing indictments for your crimes against humanity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IAmSlimTrump @maggieNYT She's distracting from the resignation in her shop of a Trump "Hater" that wasn't vile enough to remain in their midst... she mad they got unmasked &amp; shown as frauds.  #FakeNews &amp; deranged "takes" from #propagandists like her... fill empty space.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redheaded_Jenn Bizaar normalizes the bizarre... 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LionelMedia Propaganda<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IAmSlimTrump @MistaBRONCO is the over/under expert.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shem_Infinite The masters demanded it; so they could incite riots &amp; looting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Odd wasn't Soylent Green on Tuesday too?   Name change coming in your future, prior to bankruptcy.  #SoiShit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoodlesTrks She stayed b'cus of taxes... they're less here than the #EU where sh'd be bled dry. She was "safe", then #Trump fired the SDNY attorney who wasn't pursuing her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chiIIum But the claim was its really 9.4% so that 'aught carry the 1 is still confusing them too. #CommonCoreCoding always a failure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2020Vernon History is irrelevant to #TheMob that's why it can repeatedly be convinced to make the same mistakes without a thought.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimHansonDC @dochartdc @SecPompeo 🤔 why are you peeps ignoring Taiwan? Closing the S China Sea?   You're still stuck in the box opened by Nixon in the '70's.   Since it's a new Cold War, Taiwan can be our Cuba.  If you don't understand how both these are connected you're being dishonest.  🇺🇸#AmericaFirst<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Marxist China is our enemy it always has been. Our allies reside on Taiwan NOT in Beijing. Those facts aren't the ancient history of Confucius either, but the tyranny of Mao.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BuckSexton @RealBasedMAGA Treat them like the air traffic controllers &amp; replace them... have conservatives educate &amp; eliminate indoctrination of those no longer "working".  WIN WIN. 🇺🇸<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chiIIum The #Globalists are the Umbrella Corp. They care 0 for peeps, only #power matters to them. 'Cus those that hold it, make the "rules".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealBasedMAGA @Alyssa_Milano Well she admits #ChineseVirus is 100% political... 'cus it's a "battle".  She's an "expert" on "make believe" that's the only world she lives in... the scripts we see her tweet only run inside her empty head.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@T_S_P_O_O_K_Y @JoeBiden The "experts" would tell the #ForgetfulOne to "give it up" already, the Party overruled them.  #ScienceDeniers 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IAmSlimTrump 🤔 sounds like more #LiberalLogic to me... 100% positive isn't possible given what we already know... 9.4% indicates it's NOT just a decimal point either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johntieso No the #Karen patrol is ruthless. 🤦‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chiIIum Well Xi tried to kill Boris... who didn't see this coming? It's a win... Italy seems to be moving that direction too... lots of deaths there as well. 🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@w_terrence @rihanna 🤣🤣🤣too funny... 🏆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chiIIum Yep was trying to redpill one who's voting Joe, 'cus unspecified Trump hate. He luvs his #MSLSD too; so the struggle is real.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RubyRockstar333 #Karen 🤔😭😭😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealBasedMAGA NOT gonna happen... wilfully entering a #ConflictZone filled with #DomesticTerrorists means they're outta bounds already.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chiIIum Hmm... seems he likes funding caravans too, but now we're NOT paying for it... it's why the #UN drafted the "Migrant Compact" &amp; enabled trafficking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IAmSlimTrump Now he tries to claim he's Lincoln too... so there's that insanity too.  🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dhookstead So does that mean #FukXi or #FukCCP are out of the question too?   How about #IStandWithTaiwan?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Odd did 0 hear the same thing about Iran too? Did Bush find WMD in Iraq?  Proof doesn't exist... just like the Russian hack of the DNC.  Fuk'n 🤡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaybeAmes Odd, seems that's all #pantifa is capable of... burning 💩 down. Fuk'n 🤡's   He probably doesn't know what you said about dead 🐪's either...   😭😭😭<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FuctupMike Didn't you 👀 #EpsteinDidntKillHimself?  Oddly a "security" detail moving &amp; hiding may have HRC shitting herself... 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So #BreadlineBernie's little moron minion proves once again what her policies do to citizens?   Econ degree issued to an illiterate proof academia a fraud.  Donkey's now "force" their sheep into the lines to "steal".   Guess that 100M law suit doesn't exist either, bartender? 🤡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robjoz83 🤔 my observation... many still believe the 🍎 was denied the opportunity to counter rational thought based on their continued experimentation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤣🤣🤣 good let them stay home w/o pay then... those air traffic controllers got replaced for this BS too... send conservatives to actually educate &amp; erase the indoctrination of those no longer "working".   Sounds like a win, win from my perspective... keep those homeschool gains<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chillax50 @hughhewitt @HawleyMO @wojespn @senjudiciary 🤣🤣🤣 sure 🤡   Debunked already... how much is Xi paying you to spread #propaganda?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FuctupMike Hope you had fun in our blu state. Perhaps Lincoln has been reborn &amp; we can restore the Union, 'cus the #Marxist appear set for a "do over". Safe trip... 👊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chuckwoolery They've been the perpetrators of the biggest hoax ever perpetrated &amp; that's quite a feat given what they've tried to do since HRC lost.  Over 99% recovery rate is hard to spin into apocalyptic, but numbers are weapons based on which ones are chosen.  #ChineseVirus #MaskFree<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@byelin @chuckwoolery 130000/330000000 = .000... 🤡  But ask #China why they sent it, K?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Danny4denise @RubyRockstar333 @CoreyAStewart I'm guessing corey has a "plan" too, just nobody cares what it is. 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Danny4denise @Redheaded_Jenn @RealBasedMAGA @RubyRockstar333 🤣🤣🤣 a 🏆day that lives on in legend that won't be forgotten.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Odd so she saw #EpsteinDidntKillHimself &amp; thinks hiding from HRC has worked thus far? I'd bet she's gonna make a break for the wire instead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chiIIum Another #Soros plant who was sent to give the radicals a pass on facing consequences for breaking the law... Jussie is gonna be hard to hide from... how many rioters &amp; looters won't be charged? The #Shitcago bodycount proves she's NOT interested in anything, but political crimes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@T_S_P_O_O_K_Y 🤣🤣🤣 too much projection... the #Marxists are the ones driving the "change" b'cus they're triggered... we just cite their fraud &amp; #hypocrisy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redheaded_Jenn @RealBasedMAGA @RubyRockstar333 I see 🐔 going in the oven at Jenn's... sprinkle that on it &amp; it will come out of the oven a winner.   Some green beans &amp; mashed taters to round out the feast, maybe? #YouGotThis 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Johnny_Joey 🤣🤣🤣 yes... clearly will NEVER be a @USMC chowhall. They'll feed you &amp; it won't poison you, but they won't ever be the "Next Iron Chef" or the runner up either. #SemperFi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chiIIum He's got to have his revolutionaries in the street &amp; that takes some bank. Incite the masses to distract from the puppet he's running; so they don't recall his 4 decades of failure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cernovich @RealSaavedra Well all Marines are basic riflemen... it's worth noting that weapon can kill at 500, but most battles aren't taking place at that range anyway... it takes 2 to carry the wounded from the battlefield... tie up their resources so they can't shoot back.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheLastRefuge2 Odd, I thought they tried to claim Podesta hack (this was never a hack), NOT the DNC/HRC emails... NO hack of HRC has ever been claimed... the DNC hack can never be proven as evidence wasn't seized. Rod is clearly the "enabler" when he caused the SC appointment thru Comey firing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harambe_fren @RealBasedMAGA The radicals all believe they deserve something they're NOT entitled to. The "demand" proof in fruitloop thought rolling around inside an empty head. Why didn't the #Marxist demand CA or NY? They're closer to the government he desires... he knows they're already on his "team".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RodRosenstein BS 🤡 a moron got conned by a spear phishing attack &amp; gave his emails away. #Gucifer   The SC proved NO direct Russian involvement &amp; even abandoned the case you wanted to try in absentia.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump enacted the Defense Production Act. This can NEVER be rolled back because of National Security reasons.   The #Chinese will NEVER "dominate" the US health market.  #AmericaFirst<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes @GordonGChang knows this too.  @SecPompeo should revoke those #ChineseVisas &amp; send the enemy home yesterday.  Pull supply chains out by the roots &amp; return them tobdomestic sourcing.  Xi deserves the same thing he gives others... "No Quarter".  #AmericaFirst<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenDuckworth @TuckerCarlson 🤣🤣🤣 sure 🤡  Your service doesn't exempt you from "deserved" criticism.  One of 2 #Dirtbag Senators from a bankrupt State.

<|startoftext|>@larryelder It's why #NFL TV #'s are gonna be a repeat of #NOOSECAR's   I ain't got time for radicals that hate me &amp; my beliefs. 🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet 🤣🤣🤣 redress for something that hasn't happened/has been illegal for over 50 years?  The definition of "systematic racism" morphs to fit every "need" i.e. "demand" of the #Marxists   It still doesn't explain their failure to "achieve" given their opportunity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Danny4denise 🤔 they burned all their shit down... so guessing nothing is left to purchase.  #BLM cares nothing about their community... the #Marxist revolution requires their sacrifice.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So 0 denies the Constitution &amp; every Citizen's Rights on the #4thofJuly   That's the anti-American rhetoric we suffered through for 8 years as he ran the Country into the ground, backed up &amp; did it again countless times.

<|startoftext|>@RealDrGina #hypocrite &amp; a #fraud ignoring her own "mandates" on the #ChineseVirus &amp; inciting violence in her city.

<|startoftext|>Odd why was this NOT part of @MariaBartiromo piece to begin with? Most who wish the equal application of the law know it wasn't in #Trump's case. The #DeepState has been hiding from their crimes for over 3 years now &amp; yet they've indicted 0 peeps. #DrainTheSwamp<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RubyRockstar333 #Marxists don't care about those numbers.

<|startoftext|>The "conspiracy" 👈 word of the Day... that's what he's trying to hide.  We know the seq of events that saw WB go to 💩 instead of IG.   Irony would be #FalseFlag to ensnare the bug-eyed freak holding "secret" court in the House basement.   #ImpeachingHearing is a #Hoax<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chelsea1935 Something tells me the establishment has "recommended" many of the appointment failures seen. DJT has too many of them in his admin. The FBI/DoJ are still full of #DeepState traitors intent on hiding institutional criminality. He can fire Wray, just like he did Comey.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealSlimDiesel That was HRC's doing... she was still pissed about the PanAm bomber...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatiePavlich The IG gathered what was left on desks, not the "reasoning" behind criminal acts. Yep the FBI screwed up... end of story... full stop.  No, Durham &amp; Barr know different this is far from over. Few trust the FBI or DoJ for good reason. Selective Prosecution is bias &amp; injustice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@INTJutsu That's exactly what the #DeepState did to spy on #Trump &amp; campaign... so the #Coup has moved from the exec branch to the House.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shem_Infinite BS they got caught lying to that same court when Mueller ran the FBI. Procedures were recommended then, which were ignored to lie again. The IG isn't there to investigate criminality only stack the deck for the #DeepState to abuse once again. He found problems Durham finds crimes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This 🤡 doesn't want you to read the report that didn't find all was done by the "book". Far from that JC, but we know you really fear Durham, not the IG who has no ability to subpoena or indict. #SpyingDidOccur &amp; you led that effort while letting HRC walk on her crimes. #Treason<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealBasedMAGA It's not stunning to those who've watched DC abuse rights for years w/o any pushback. The #DeepState are rogue actors defying law &amp; policy from those who have that authority. #Ukraine is just the latest example... 0 making the Exec branch an HRC campaign arm was #Treason<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealBasedMAGA @FBI @Durham He's got more than just that... you can bank on it. That's why DC is trying to make #Trump disappear w/o a crime... their intent is to bring fear into the mind of any who replace him (though #Trump shouldn't be thrown out based on this Hoax for sure) not to hold DC accountable.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealBasedMAGA @Pontifex 🤔 @SpeakerPelosi massacred innocent children... there fixed it for you constantly confused Pope.

<|startoftext|>@VernonAgain @FBI He may try, but he doesn't have the authority to exonerate anyone. Like V2 of Mueller Report all he's able to do is provide an opinion.

<|startoftext|>@feingold32 Till true Patriots make a stand &amp; throw their hat in the ring to unseat them, we aren't retaking the Republic.

<|startoftext|>@VernonAgain Ah... no they expected the voters to elect reps that would uphold the law &amp; the Constitution. That's not what we have in DC. That's due to uniparty &amp; the intentional stupidity of the People for not demanding qualified candidates hold those seats. A Republic, if you can keep her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JessieJaneDuff The Pope won't even allow her to partake in Communion. That is a statement indicating her soul is damned, not saved... she is unrepentant and will be tormented by the demons of Hell as she now does that to the People of the US.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@stacy_redvirgo @bahamamills Pushups? I call Malarkey on Joe which contradicts his fantasy tour of Iowa... sounds like a kickback as well as quid pro quo. Guess Hunter's safe from "hurting" himself as plugs is caught in graft to go with his gaffe. #Twofer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤣🤣🤣 that's why this moron's campaign stops were held in phonebooths. Mr. 0% 1st One Out claims those w/o evidence of crimes should force others to vote his way when his Party didn't even want him. Hey dumbshit, cite a crime, you can't &amp; neither can they. #Impeach &amp; get #REKT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@semperfivets #SemperFi brother... guarding Heaven's streets till we come to take that post with you. 🔩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VernonAgain It's also why #Traitors deserve death, not jail... future pardons could absolve them of crimes against the Republic. Barr reinstates death penalty for that reason? 🤔  Impeachment doesn't mean removal is guaranteed... and doesn't preclude another run for POTUS even if they are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bahamamills @realDonaldTrump @GOP Agreed, it's one stark reason to question the purpose of a party. Their purpose should be to field a candidate for every ballot there is nationally. Winning isn't as important as a willingness to fight for each seat. #NoFreebies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VernonAgain The eye for an eye in me says do the same to him. Whimps now just give them a 💉 to put them to sleep. They need to restore public executions if they want a civil society, it is a constant reminder that actions have consequences... this dirtbag's clock strikes 12. Good riddance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump why is the @GOP sitting this out? Is it a win? Does it change upticket votes if it is or isn't? Never give them an uncontested ballot... that saves them money they don't have. Make them "pay" if they do get the seat. #MAGA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hrtablaze So you believe the #Traitors have no skeletons in their closet? DC is a corrupt cesspool that taints all. There was a reason we've seen many "retire" the uniparty was always gonna try this. I for one want to see that criminality shown; so they can hang for their acts. Bluff call.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheRISEofROD LOL... Malarkey should have been his response... throw his lies back in his face for being a fraud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisjollyhale 🤔 sure that's why the Pope won't let her partake of Communion... he knows her soul is damned while you've just proven yourself as totally clueless.   Quite a feat... you should be quite proud... I jest... #Shame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VernonAgain Well that sweatshirt she's wearing is proof she's a space cadet, b'cus she sure as Hell isn't NASA "material". She'd open the hatch to get a breath of "fresh" air while in orbit guaranteed. 👩‍🚀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RNcat50 @SpeakerPelosi That's the same lie ana on CNN tries claiming she's an R. Making the claim &amp; living it are 2 separate things. Even a #Commie Pope won't let her partake of Communion. Her soul is damned... even he knows it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ctuton1 🤣🤣🤣 sure... the local Russians voted to rejoin in a rigged vote that had no credibility... they "gave" Crimea to Ukraine in exchange for taking their Nukes back when Russia broke up. National Sovereignty isn't a local decision... comrade.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So do we charge her when she gets back? She doesn't run foreign policy for the US, but that statement says different. We are NOT in any climate policy pushed by the #Globalists to steal our wealth. #LoganAct violation from @SpeakerPelosi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@julie_smythe @NahBabyNah 🤣🤣🤣 sure... another meme devoid of facts... that cut &amp; paste reply you got that down pat. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 so being an openly #Communist HRC 2.0 is gonna be so much better than her losing a 3rd time? Here's your warpaint 🤡   #Trump2020 will mop the floor with this fool. 52T is only one of her fantasy policy ideas... there isn't enough blood in that turnip for you to bleed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@julie_smythe @NahBabyNah "I have named them"... yep ya did... that meme "expert" did on the "updated" meme... along with Flynn. Though other details were quite obscure... i.e. Flynn isn't guilty either, but that doesn't fit your preconceived narrative built on talking points &amp; #hearsay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steph93065 @BrianKempGA Bad party politics, which establishment hack pushed her Brian? We will get rid of party idiots who subvert the "Home" team through bad policy decisions. The @GOP is NOT our ally, but part of the problem. Seems counter to GA Abortion Law; so stinks like a dead fish in the GA sun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@julie_smythe @NahBabyNah ROFL... yep deny those crimes... which is why he's in jail.   A low info moron &amp; one who can't meme either... 🤣🤣🤣 Liz isn't going anywhere except back to her appropriated reservation with peeps like you. 1/1024th #Epic self-own 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@julie_smythe @NahBabyNah ROFL... yep it's obvious your grasp of reality is as bad as your comprehension of facts... guess that Podesta angle scared you 'cus all you did was accuse me of doing what you've done for several days... deny... &amp; repeat lies... all opinion from you... I brought facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reborn_hardcore 🤣🤣🤣No, I was using a real weapon then too... we had the A1 with full auto, but got the A2 before discharge &amp; returning home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@julie_smythe @NahBabyNah No you keep trying to say crimes exist that don't. Manifort crimes were tied to his work for Podesta, but it's #Trump   It's you being an idiot conflating like a usual lib... trying to taint everything under the sun through accusation, not fact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@julie_smythe @NahBabyNah 🤣🤣🤣 It's a meme so it must be true... since Manifort's crimes had nothing to do with #Trump   Again repeating talking points &amp; unable to cite a crime... #Trump did w/o proof... just a stupid Liz loon... reeeeeeeee  #Trump2020 gonna be a long 5 years for ya. 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ctuton1 Crimea was part of the Ukraine 🤡 I know it hurts you to ignore that "fact". I've got no double standards &amp; didn't deflect as you did comrade.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@julie_smythe @NahBabyNah 🤣🤣🤣sure there are? Who?  Your bot keeps repeating now... must have run out of talking points to regurgitate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@julie_smythe @NahBabyNah Sure 🤡 let me know when you can cite a crime... you're still at at 0 indictment count yourself... 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaMei62 @RuthieRedSox 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 he's not fitting through the eye of the needle. That statement only proves Peter will send him to meet McTumor, not God. Hey Mike, you can't buy your way in, just like you can't buy the Presidency ya 🤡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealSlimDiesel She ugly.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@julie_smythe @NahBabyNah You should start with stating a single fact, you haven't produced a single one yet. If you think you're winning anything except a participation trophy 2020 will be a landslide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@julie_smythe @NahBabyNah Well thanks for sharing... I know it's been hard being a failure all your life. It's why you're attracted to a race appropriator &amp; #fraud as your candidate. So ignorant you believe her 52T is gonna be growing from money trees. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@julie_smythe @NahBabyNah Yep that's why you have nothing, but #hearsay &amp; #fantasy upon which to base your claims. Alinsky watches you play his game as a fool &amp; laughs... #Labels don't work any better in court. 0 indictments = none... &amp; you still can't cite any actual law that's been broken just your mind<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@julie_smythe @NahBabyNah No ya can't... 'cus ya haven't... Manifort? Process crime nothing do with #Trump Cohen? ROFL sure his crimes, not '45... Rudy? Odd he's not been charged... keep believing the propaganda... thanks for proving you live in Narnia or you got accepted at Hogwarts. #Fantasy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@julie_smythe @NahBabyNah ROFL 🤡 check your Nancy at the door... #Loser<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@julie_smythe @NahBabyNah Yep Mueller couldn't manufacture a crime, but don't tell the loons... they don't need one except for their '16 loss... 😂😂😂😂👌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@julie_smythe @NahBabyNah Cite a crime? There is no QPQ... those House witnesses said so... using "I felt" instead of showing proof, but distract using others crimes that were theirs, not #Trump's  It's gonna be funny watching those tears when #Trump2020 gets his 2nd term.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MariaBartiromo @RobertW38113039 @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness @FoxNews @SundayFutures Wut? Distracting from #ImpeachmentHearings isn't gonna happen...

<|startoftext|>@julie_smythe @NahBabyNah Nah ya don't, but keep wishing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redheaded_Jenn LOL... we've got a plasma cutter from any BS this 🤡 wants to "build". It's gonna remind us once again these idiots used to be @GOP relevant... as they keep whispering at zombies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillKristol 🤣🤣🤣 @mchooyah said Eddie could have his trident you 🤡  You aren't that bright &amp; have no insight except for perpetual war &amp; a willingness to send the military to die for your failed policy that's been rejected.  #RingTheBell Billy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage God peeps are "weak" these days... it's what comes from the cessation of placing heads on pikes for acts of #Terror. The Tower of London has fallen, you are Rome in its last days &amp; invited Hannibal in. You can't even manage to tell the EU to sod off. Lead, fight or surrender. #UK<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Wenwei_Li @AllJackoff @Vader0577 Nah... not really... we powered their econ by eliminating US jobs for slave labor. They steal our tech &amp; IP to use as they see fit including their military. We can move those outsourced jobs elsewhere instead of aiding an adversary. I don't see them returning based on Corp greed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SaraCarterDC So an IG Report release affects the prosecutors how? They either lied to the court &amp; knew it, or are named in it as a conspiracy set up. They are not oblivious of those acts; so when will they be brought up on charges &amp;  @GenFlynn be exonerated? @SidneyPowell1 knows this too.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Redheaded_Jenn 🤣🤣🤣 Chief Crazy Loon goes on the warpath? 🤔... she does remind me of HRC 2.0; so I'm betting they've all been "silenced" just like her #MEME team &amp; her blowup 🐕<|endoftext|>

Rant elsewhere loon, I got better things to do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VikesGirl4Evs @Vader0577 @AnnPastwick @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump ROFL... sure... guess that's why his trial is still ongoing if it was all a slam dunk prosecution not a "hit".<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@VikesGirl4Evs @Vader0577 @AnnPastwick @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Nope... nothing to do with #Trump or campaign... you're again being disingenuous... you should just quit now...

<|startoftext|>@VikesGirl4Evs @Vader0577 @AnnPastwick @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump ROFL... sure hearsay... those aren't facts, but opinion 🤡 the WB heard rumor &amp; innuendo &amp; isn't a WB either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@myhtopoeic It's why they took over student loans... the ability to line the pockets of radicals to indoctrinate while the recipients learned nothing useful in life. An uniformed populace a moral hazard to ensuring societal stability.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vader0577 @VikesGirl4Evs @AnnPastwick @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump ROFL... keeps distracting to "process" crime in no way connected to #Trump or campaign. Lying to the secret court is a crime too, but don't look behind the curtain to find the conspiracy... 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davdsoul @realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣 he already tried that with HRC &amp; used the DC &amp; Foreign Govs to ensure it.

<|startoftext|>ROFL JD, the Constitution protects even the POTUS from the Government, not the other way around.

<|startoftext|>ROFL... I thought the #DeepState confirmed HRC wasn't hacked? We know none that can say that about the DNC. So this 🤡 can't cite an actual crimes, but spins the excuse wheel for her next conspiracy... having seen none firsthand. #Hearsay overruled, gavel resounds.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hey @DonaldJTrumpJr here is a great source for #TriggeredAgain after your dad wins in 2020, and another "best" seller.

<|startoftext|>@Mimirocah1 ROFL... cite a "crime"... I'm going with #1A so 💦 isn't a winning strategy, but overturning the Rule of Law is? Believing the "Law" is something it isn't just proves them as #Frauds   Take "prove your innocence" to any court &amp; you'll get #REKT<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@45Wildwayne Gee I thought he was quoting Giant Banana which would have been the 1st sense he's made... instead he disappoints once again. 🤔 yep just like the Kangaroo Court Schitty is running.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealBasedMAGA @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump Well the insidious liar deserves the shade he's getting. He gave us #Trump as his parting gift &amp; it's the only thing worthwhile we got for surviving 8 years of his incompetence.  #Trump2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@myhtopoeic It allows "them" to shut you down.   This is gonna be an easy way for the #Censors to silence any they choose.  The "red phone" rings &amp; you disappear on comnand or they give your data to the enemy w/o a peep.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>No, you're trying to give other people's money.

<|startoftext|>@KatieHill4CA @DevinNunes 🤣🤣🤣 sure spoken by one bereft of ethics &amp; morals... did you tweet that before or after hitting the bong? So stoner, can you cite a crime?

<|startoftext|>@Secede4America @RealBasedMAGA Huh, you based your assumption on wut? Was it your total lack of historical fact or ignorance of the Constitution?

Those who do the bidding of business &amp; continue to sell out the American worker to China &amp; H1Bs. Only by running against them will they be forced to change. Policy not frauds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeghanMcCain Huh, American Traitor is how I see him. You see him anyway you choose, but odd you don't afford that choice to others believing it's yours alone. We are much better off since his passing though LG still channels the #Warmonger occasionally &amp; just like your pops at the worst time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tonytwobets @OohMow Mmmmm... Scotch in my best Homer voice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OGKDubs Sounds like Soros is creating openings for him to buy to undermine the rule of law... Chicago &amp; SFran are in the win column... spent a bunch in VA to implement #Socialism there too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have NEVER been a nation of illegal immigrants... there fixed it for you liar. You do know people were sent back from Ellis Island don't you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redheaded_Jenn Her pops Ambassador to China... seems the bad apple doesn't fall far from the poisoned tree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marklevinshow Ask her pops how much he got for selling us out to China. #Globalist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GraceShi07 @RealBasedMAGA The indoctrinated youth have been brainwashed by academia undermining their future &amp; their grasp of what constitutes reality... academia is the same as the Chinese government in this Country &amp; weakens our ability to fight foreign influence in the future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GraceShi07 @RealBasedMAGA Tell me you believe the Chinese government won't hunt them down in the future... they know that's the end game being played out right now. One thing they detest above all else is civil disobedience. It challenges their authority &amp; shows others they don't need to remain silent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealBasedMAGA Well being financed to commit a #Coup would surely be problematic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Thomas1774Paine Hmm... faked his fingerprints?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhilMcCrackin44 @Marine0141 @JohnBrennan @screaminAsmith3 Or he's hiding from the "team" HRC sent to #Epstein him.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealBasedMAGA Not much conviction in that voice... 🤣🤣🤣 stop &amp; character? Has she seen his roving hands? Hide those kids. He's talking to the screen at a live event... a bumbling, lost fool... go get his applesauce.  He was at 20%; so only 1 in 5 loons are giving #CornPop a 👍 #Desperate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheGeorgianVern LOL... an idea that was corrupted since '16? E-fame &amp; follow counts more important than non-motivational garbage?   🤔 that sounds much like DC.   I'm with turning over those tables... the merry-go-round tanked '18.   #MAGA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GraceShi07 @RealBasedMAGA Sure... I spent 2 years on OKI... it wasn't b'cus Japan was a beligerant nation... only two fit that bill... #China &amp; NK at that time... or perhaps you've forgotten the Chosin or believe T Square didn't happen either. Xi puppet.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FuctupMike I'd suspect it's the #Socialist policies... he doesn't give a 🐀's ass about the media... he knows they're a corrupt bunch of frauds &amp; liars.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That is a statement wholly based in fact. It's why many try to emulate us, but we are remade in the crucible of fire &amp; hardened through battle while they are defeated. #Marines #MarineCorpsBirthday #USMC #1stToFight for this reason. #SemperFi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RuthieRedSox That's been over for a while now, yet the #DeepState drags its feet while changing words &amp; meaning to hide their criminality.

<|startoftext|>@TheGeorgianVern An IG no, but they don't issue indictments. Our belief is we will see justice done or we don't have a Republic.

<|startoftext|>@BreitbartNews Ah NO... we don't need any RINO #Traitors Cindy. These idiots need to be purged from the GOP. No more #Warmongers &amp; no more #Globalists selling out the Country at every turn. The slaughter &amp; treasure wasted on failed policy has come to an end, we should never repeat it again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@USMCSDI This is the day that the Lord has made &amp; it will be a great one indeed.

<|startoftext|>@RealBasedMAGA @MSNBC LOL... no he didn't.

<|startoftext|>ROFL gonna gift themselves a lump of coal. Brilliant strategy from those who have no policy or a way to defeat @realDonaldTrump at the ballot box.

<|startoftext|>@TheGeorgianVern The modern Dem plantation is real. Decades of urban blight perpetrated by their policies has fed a false narrative to ensure their return every election to do it again. Any who counter those desires is attacked into silence/drown out.

<|startoftext|>To the idiot standing up in the front... sit down little man.

<|startoftext|>@USMCSDI Academia is out of control. The radicals &amp; #Communists insist on indoctrinating not educating.  It's how you defeat from within. The idiots they're churning out are societally disfunctional.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vader0577 They wanted their own #Communist to revere. Pay no attention to the 💩 &amp; 💉 lying in the streets... or the homeless who've turned them into the 3rd World. All they're waiting for is one big flush.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@myhtopoeic #MAGA has been infiltrated by many... TP has repeated bad policy ideas... #Invaders must be let in was just one I've seen... this is group think intent on capturing a constituency.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steph93065 🤔 they better think twice... or 3 or 4 at least. We aren't gonna take it lying down. It's time the 1984 cru gets shut down. If they believe we'll remain calm as we see a Banana Republic in DC, not a Republic it will end in ashes &amp; what's left will be built atop their bones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Thomas1774Paine 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 #KamalaToe goes full HRC... none want the whore; so she plays the victim card to place blame anywhere except where it belongs. Didn't we just rid ourselves of #KatieHill? We don't need another sexworker to replace her as POTUS.  #HeelsUpHarris<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for telling us you don't really exist... you ran for POTUS &amp; none noticed proving you as a deep fake Congressional Representative. #Nukem based on a fictional character in a video game 🤔 yep you'te just a #DeepFake set on perpetual lie.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RepDougCollins Right 🤡 Ken Starr was a special prosecutor not a committe chair. Get your facts squared away &amp; quit repeating Dem lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Desertpuma @ShnydaOne @sear_pin @Breaking911 It's why there's no vote... it's not #Impeachment the loons just use that word to string their idiots along. They're too stupid to know the difference, but that's nothing new either... #Frauds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LOL 🌽 no smear... opinion doesn't equal fact, but you're too stupid to understand the difference.

<|startoftext|>@SaraCarterDC "I" &amp; "think" tell you all you need to know... opinion is NOT fact. We have a treaty with them for this very purpose, but let's not allow our laws get in the way of an illegal #Coup   #ImpeachmentHoax<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealBasedMAGA @TheDemocrats They can't remember what lie they told 5 minutes ago. They've got 0, but chafed asses &amp; sad feelz.

<|startoftext|>ROFL 🤡 you don't get to watch over @POTUS shoulder as he runs the Country. Oversight is not a seat at the table. Where's the whistleblower you conspired with? Durham is now conducting a "criminal" investigation &amp; your time is about up, what charges are you guilty of?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Thomas1774Paine I agree he will never run b'cus he's guilty as sin &amp; the time to pay the piper draws near. Those Bible quotes have disappeared, he's sold his soul to that Devil, 0. His bestie Mueller couldn't save him or his co-conspirators.<|endoftext|>

Durham on the other hand does. 0's cabal is about to get read the Riot Act... oops.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Thomas1774Paine Somebody ask this liar to state what her "need to know" reason is. Last I checked, she was running an extortion racket on the #NetFlix board. The liar &amp; unmasking fraud deserves jail for her acts, not a phone call. #DawnRaid<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC So is that your excuse for a #DoNothingLindsey in the Senate?  Can you explain how many hearings you've held in the last week, month, or this year?  Seems a lot of "secret" ones have occurred in the House. You didn't want to hear the ambassador too?  Why not?  We're with #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FuctupMike ROFL a Republican voted for the #GND? 🤣🤣🤣 hmm... 🤔 didn't it get 0 votes in the Senate? I can check the House vote if I choose that's public info... yep we should tell her district the vote is in December not November &amp; ensure this idiot leaves DC 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VernHuckleberry He'd be panting before he'd gone a block if the 💩 really hit the fan... those city folk; so stupid... think those store shelves just restock magically.

<|startoftext|>@m5drummer @VernHuckleberry #Trump said he'd put that list out.  It's #Fraud the taxpayer shouldn't be funding their perversion or hide those crimes from the public. Use of our money makes those names our domain.  Where are those names @realDonaldTrump?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@m5drummer @gatewaypundit @LindseyGrahamSC @RepAdamSchiff That's the problem with the #Warmonger he wants our military to fight endless wars in foreign lands, but doesn't even fight for his own. #Twofaced   Brave, Brave Sir Lindsey... turned his tail &amp; fled... to write a strongly worded letter... 🤦‍♂️  #WhereIsLindsey<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BrugesGroup @RNcat50 Well perhaps they should choose to vote them out &amp; replace them with those willing to fulfill the #Brexit referendum. I guess the #EU could string you along &amp; give you another extension in perpetuity. #Cowards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steph93065 Never underestimate the desire of the #Warmonger they risk nothing in their desire to continue failed policy they don't control.

<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC @RNcat50 Huh 🤡 worry about your sandbox... call a hearing already. Nobody is tying your hands, but your lack of action shows you shouldn't be the Chairman. You want it out get it from the horse's mouth not the ass that hides in the House.  #DoNothingLindsey #AllTalkZeroAction   #MAGA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This surely explains why I spent 12 hours in #Twitmo for posting a pic jak claimed was real. Depraved #Fraud &amp; #Liar who is surprised it's a Donkey from CA? It's what a #Shithole State sends to represent them.  How many others got the same fate she now denies?  #Censorship<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage @RNcat50 It's a trick &amp; not a #Brexit treat. Why am I not surprised by those so focused on undoing the will of the people? I guess you don't need dental coverage as sweets have been banned once again. What utter #Globalist cowards, the sun sets on a once great empire afraid of its shadow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RNcat50 @m5drummer @senatemajldr @NATO I'd be more concerned whether they'll meet the 2% GDP requirement spent on defense since Germany &amp; others refuse to do so. Who's paying their bills &amp; who's not?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just don't post the pic to prove it, the fascist #Censors will send you to the #Twitmo re-education camp.  They hide perversion, but silence those who point it out.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>🤣🤣🤣 sure #Commie your econ is tanking... what is it now? Worst in 27 years?

<|startoftext|>@GenuineHeart7 @SaraCarterDC @NicolleDWallace Well at least he'll have his rights restored instead of Donkeys conducting an illegal Banana Republic coup.

<|startoftext|>@m5drummer @chuckwoolery That is likely their aim, but will doom them to extinction. We've had an eye &amp; an earfull of the lies for 3+ years and are pissed beyond belief. The party will find coffers empty having betrayed constituents. The only reason they have money is because of #Trump   #Trump2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Thomas1774Paine Well then, the Republic is doomed anyway; so let's get the party started. We've been Alinsky labeled everything under the sun. Yet all those claiming we're conspiracy theorists keep coming up wrong. We will not go quietly into that good night. Freemen will fight to remain so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet Never apologize to the mob, it's only seen as weakness which incites them to increase the attacks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sure #Commie the story of an illegal unmasker who abused power to commit #Treason tries to lie her way into money for her defense fund. She's gonna need it... the gallows awaits all you co-conspirators. #DrainTheSwamp   #Trump2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealSaavedra @LindseyGrahamSC I heard "slow walk" no @LindseyGrahamSC has been doing a "no walk".

<|startoftext|>@Flashyred1 @bahamamills Eat a dik seems more appropriate... 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WTF are you smoking? The Donkeys not #Trump are putting the Country through this because they committed crimes to ensure HRC would win.

<|startoftext|>@cvpayne #Globalist greed. They'll take a hit to return to a rigged game. That undermines faith in markets they use to make profit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FascistTwatter They can't win on facts or debate. Their desire to "control" overrides any concept of right or wrong. They are at war with those who oppose their views. Either fight them or remain silent &amp; become their victims... I'd rather fight... there is no surrender for me. #MAGA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keque_Mage That's been obvious to many of us for quite a while. Now the damage can't be undone; so you're screwed for believing the #Globalist idiot in the first place.

<|startoftext|>uttering rubbish w/o a basis in truth or fact while refusing to answer for their own criminality.

<|startoftext|>The media trying to convince all they tell peeps what to think while telling lies.  Foreign policy from armchair quarterbacks that have never stood on the wall to perpetrate endless conflict.  Leaders with a stark lack of moral character condescending to peeps hysterically...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Been a while since speaking my mind...  A coup in the House? How Banana Republic of the 🤡  Gov spying on all.

<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet So segregation exists in the multicultural cesspool of the UK?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedcruz That's the definition of foreign influence that the Founders forbid in their documents. We now see why we should have 0 integration with the totalitarian regime in China. This is what greed looks like &amp; it's obvious that slave labor is the cause.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bahamamills @FoxNews has become decaf @CNN almost all of their BS is unwatchable #NWO crap.

<|startoftext|>@005_five @TwistedUpMike Power Hoarding? Must be why two old white guys are currently leading their #Losing Light Brigade charge to unseat #Trump  Word Salad stupidity on display &amp; it's called brainwashing.  Pantifa are the fascist supremacists. Projection.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Thomas1774Paine ROFL... again the Failling NYT trots out fantasy narrative as fact.

<|startoftext|>@TipsyPianoBar That's why I'll be glad to retire at the end of the year. They will also try to destroy your ability to earn a wage, and I'm ready to fight the #Commies full-time.

<|startoftext|>@Saints43_ @RightHookUSA @CCADedu @alcal74 More like Censoring. They are "classics" not because of authors or the color of their skin, but because they've stood the test of time.

<|startoftext|>@RightHookUSA A sure sign of the endtimes when those w/o morals believe themselves to be paragons of virtue. They are the Devil's tool ensuring the mindless who emulate them burn in the lake of fire. I will not call evil good. The #NWO is #Pedowood heart &amp; soul.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SenatorRomney I'm glad you'll never be POTUS. Your Establishment taint is truly telling. Your insistence on some self-appointed moral authority the sign of a bitter loser.

<|startoftext|>ROFL... the integrity we expect from our Justice System? You mean like Foxx dropping 16 felony indictments? Or committing adultery to get your job? Just not sure what Justice was denied... #HeelsUp listening to Tupac smoking a joint... sure #CommieKam fraud &amp; a liar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillKristol Ahoy there Billy how's the Weakly Slander doing? I see your still believing yourself relevant... sorry Mueller couldn't take away your pain. I guess you'll have to be satisfied with the ashes of failure when #Trump wins again in 2020.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PhilipRucker @gregpmiller You really want us to believe you weren't Putin's b*tch? You have 0 credibility b'cus you carried HRC's water for the '16 election.

<|startoftext|>@RightHookUSA Well they should be "resisted" right out the door. Politicization of Intel ensures the answers will be bad... based on politics not facts.

<|startoftext|>@cvpayne Well it's production is a National Security issue... you think an adversary is just gonna give you material to defend your national interests? Gov subsidies aren't free trade.

<|startoftext|>@starsandstripes @SaraCarterDC LOL... conspiracy theories from the police now?... "think" sounds highly ambivalent... but they've quashed the most likely suspect before the flames had even been put out... &amp; that pattern has played out throughout the country. #Lying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RubyRockstar333 @Danny4denise @ASimplePatriot Ah the perpetual "day" of rage... sure they should do it to prepare for the apocalypse to come when they'll have no choice. I got dibs on that slab of bacon she's giving up for the "cause". #AmericaFirst #BuildTheWall<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MistaBRONCO @Fuctupmind Yes... MB need a "Team" of Treason Hunters. I said they should be using DoD peeps for this, but likely a few inside the wire who still believe in the Republic &amp; what it stands for. For the Republic All.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepSeanMaloney Yes we already knew 44 &amp; HRC conspired to rig an election... thanks for playing Mr. Obvious. #MuellerReport say it with me... no obstruction, no collusion... propagandist fool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VinnyCiamp Yes that's what all this distraction has been about hiding DC crimes. They felt safe b'cus they were sure of an HRC win. Now the other shoe is about to drop.

<|startoftext|>@005_five @AOC @RashidaTlaib Huh... anyone taking bets on if her fantasy impeachment plan will do better or worse than her Green New Deal? #AOCSays Mueller made me do it.

<|startoftext|>@LeoSully3 @DreadPirateB @joncoopertweets @realDonaldTrump You have to have morals to have shame... he has none. That's why the left can't meme... blucucks are worse than the average loons, yet believe themselves highly clever... delusional.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lucet_Veritas @SJVET45 @JuddLegum Well if he had actual political insight he'd know to delete his tweet now. Maybe SM just isn't his game.

<|startoftext|>@MistaBRONCO Never underestimate the will of someone who now has "cause". You know #Trump does; so will Barr be filled with righteous indignation on what they tried to do to the Republic? One can hope he is. I know many real Americans are as well. #MuellerReport<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ROFL sure @SpeakerPelosi you hitting the bottle this early? He didn't give you indictments... testimony isn't gonna change that, but I know you're aware the Hoax you perpetrated has collapsed &amp; you're headed for another thrashing in 2020. #MuellerReport means #Trump2020Landslide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SebGorka You should know reason &amp; logic don't work on the fanatical. They're too invested in their "cause" &amp; belief in secret knowledge &amp; meaning... yes it's a cult.

<|startoftext|>@JayhawkLas ROFL sure... dude is smoking crack. Need a crime for impeachment f'ing idiot.

<|startoftext|>ROFL fake conservative neoCON says Trump covers up crimes that didn't happen by acting badly. Hey @benshapiro was it immoral to move the embassy to Jerusalem?

<|startoftext|>Libs you see this? Wouldn't want you to miss a prime opportunity to begin your crying fit. @realDonaldTrump exonerated by #MuellerReport that #BarrCoverUp just you wishing to remain oblivious that he's still your President &amp; #Trump2020 means a 2nd term.

<|startoftext|>@SebGorka ROFL... if you don't leak we won't be able to deny your statements 'cus the 4th Estate hasn't been right in 3 years. They've ignored Treason to repeat a hoax willingly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They've run out of @TIME   #MuellerReport is gonna crush the propaganda ministry.  Why would I think a liar wouldn't be rewarded by the "cause".  Anybody even read this rag anymore?  Waiting for #Treason indictments now. #SpyingDidOccur<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@005_five Hmm... I thought the Catholic Church still owned Notre Dame... sure sounds like private property confiscation to me... the "accident" narrative is a bit much... this follows a pattern throughout their Country that tells you it was anything but an accident. Macron distracts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BOURRELL @ABC All for that, but not a 51st State part. Treat it like DC. The District of Shitcago. Not handing them 2 Senators to open the borders &amp; destroy the Constitution to follow their #Commie desires. #MILGA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HNIJohnMiller @FuctupMike @snopes Mike can "verify" it's authenticity. Still #1 in my book... that ball hit its intended mark... many times over.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Paulafairydust @davdsoul They are the only ones who care... playing ID politics is now their game too. They have no platform upon which they can win; so manufacture one... which was the point of the original tweet posted about this nobody Mayor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davdsoul Huh... I guess you didn't read... he asked what can you "add to the conversation"... I guess in this case not much, but thanks for playing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RightHookUSA Well when they control the "content" you see they control what you believe to be true. Only those that question what they've been presented with understand that they've been "lied" to. It's one reason I call it the idiotnet. Attention span nil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RightHookUSA Shit ask her to define #Socialism too. #AOCSays what's on the "script" handed to her. They're not sending their best. IQ challenged.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RightHookUSA The #Globalists disagree... their desire is to enslave you under the auspices of the benevolent NWO Leviathan they desire.

<|startoftext|>@RightHookUSA ROFL wokesters? Hooked on the propaganda they've been fed as an excuse on why HRC lost. Fantasy narrative still being perpetrated because opinion is expressed as fact. They have no inclination to check statements made; so doesn't scream woke to me... sheeple seeking affirmation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet Another liberal who selected a profession they are unfit for. A librarian that "hates" books. Bad career choices for empty minds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Thomas1774Paine Well the Chinese hacked OPM during '44 tenure not to mention the HRC "secret" server; so continuing to lobby for cybercrimes seems a pattern being repeated now to jeopardize National Security.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Thomas1774Paine Well she's not fooling anybody with that line... 0 = 0 idiot. Though witness testimony tampering &amp; anti-Semitic statements from her caucus indicates a result that's less than zero.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RightHookUSA #Commies just want to take other people's money for their causes... they get to keep theirs 'cus they'll send you to the gulag if you question them on it... #Scrooge send him some illegals as a prize... drop them off at his front door.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JessieJaneDuff That's why #SocialismKills promises made lead to less of everything... then the Hunger Games begin as you try not to starve to death. Yes it's all free 'cus there's nothing to be had except shared misery &amp; death.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Thomas1774Paine ROFL... that's not use of the land for the Public good, but #Commies aren't too bright to begin with. She's stuck on that free lie too... who's paying for the Park Rangers?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindaSuhler Comrade Bill loves wasting Tax Payer money on losing causes. He's a liar, fraud &amp; Commie that's why it's called Karma.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MicroHonkyTonk @DocVoliday This is how #Globalists &amp; #Commies destroy history &amp; culture to erase people's connection to their nation... it allows them to rewrite history to suit their narrative &amp; enslave others through their ignorance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DreadPirateB @RightHookUSA @mtholyoke I'd have to agree not much to teach or educate, but they seem fixated on indoctrination. I hope he sues you are #1A attack on his Constitutional Rights. Those degrees aren't going to be worth squat in the real World... failing again acemdemia tyranny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RightHookUSA Checking the boxes... it's all about the feelz... policy &amp; experience means nothing... '44 proved that twice... we will not be picking someone that'll challenge his claim to being a 0.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RNcat50 @TipsyPianoBar Thanks Cat... always a pleasure to see my #MAGA friends. I know that means we'll be spreading the #Trump message thru the 'verse. They may not want to hear that truth, but remaining silent isn't an option. Ya know I luv my nurses too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump It's now called Red Journalism... the #FakeNews media is Pravda reborn. Their credability is at 0 &amp; it's their own fault. Bigger than #Watergate but they can't handle the BHO/HRC truth instead perpetrating their lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@truthsearch1957 @TipsyPianoBar @trexegg Well I haven't heard the claimed reason... gonna have to say more than restoration caused it. Those companies just gonna go bankrupt to take the blame? Owners don't do that... the rush screams coverup.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RightHookUSA Hmm... Cohen an embarrassment? Nope, only fools believe a known liar... Schitty &amp; witness tampering with his testimony... ensures he'll see perjury charges for those lies.

<|startoftext|>@RightHookUSA Another #Beato with a Bush pedigree?

<|startoftext|>@_StephanieMyers @OANN I'd suspect they're hungry... yep put a tax on food, brilliant.

<|startoftext|>@RightHookUSA They need a permanent underclass which begs for scraps to keep them in power... Americans have rejected cradle &amp; grave plantation keepers.

<|startoftext|>@RightHookUSA Been slowwalking this BS for 2 years, but Immigration advocates are the only "named" sources? Sure that explains the border crisis...

<|startoftext|>@sandune913 @RNcat50 @RubyRockstar333 @IlhanMN @realDonaldTrump That's is problem... they actively embraced the subversive rabid radicals who she now can't control.

<|startoftext|>@DocVoliday Are we surprised? Not at all... calling themselves Pantifa told you who they were... changing shirt color from brown to black didn't change the roots of their cause either. The #FemiNAZI wing is no different.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RightHookUSA Good if that's all it takes... let's start a bunch to deport Sarsour &amp; Omar... &amp; the rest of the #Commie #Terrorist cru. TFF a petition?

<|startoftext|>@1Stubborngirl Huh sure... the Jupiter Chamber of Commerce is still awaiting her arrival.

<|startoftext|>@m5drummer @IlhanMN It doesn't help... that's why she's for it. None have a right to enlist, the military accepts or rejects your request. Many are rejected for a variety of reasons...

<|startoftext|>Yes adding "fluffy" descriptors only confuses those who are ignorant to begin with. #SocialismKills<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@m5drummer @IlhanMN Not surprised she wishes the degradation of military readiness. It aids in the enemies ability to defeat us. Confused is those who will take her bait &amp; insist they're with the #DomesticTerrorist for saying it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@1Stubborngirl @Reuters Yep... 0 credability 'cus they don't arrest peeps for "falls". Trying the same shit here that they do to cover up what we see in Germany after the invasion... shouldn't be here. #SendThemAllBack<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fuctupmind @sassy1ntn Can't fix that much #Commie stupidity.

<|startoftext|>@Gingrich_of_PA @WalkiriaUSA Huh sure... process crimes &amp; indicting Russian Intel officers not to mention businesses that didn't exist at that time shows the only cyber crimes committed were being perpetrated by the US Government &amp; willing "allies". #SpyGate was cyber all right, it was sedition &amp; treason too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WalkiriaUSA Hypocrisy... say it's not so @SpeakerPelosi you've been shouting their "virtues" in your rambling nonsensical way for years.

<|startoftext|>@TipsyPianoBar @carmenlezeth @JohnBrennan Johnnie must know his nuts are in a vice. #SpyingDidOccur &amp; he was a perpetrator... his outbursts show he was ill suited for that job &amp; guessing that character flaw is why he no longer has a clearance.

<|startoftext|>@HillaryClinton Huh... so did you &amp; you weren't POTUS... &amp; never will be. Now @realDonaldTrump didn't break the law #MuellerReport said so.

<|startoftext|>@WalkiriaUSA Send them all to CA... it's already a Shithole state.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1Stubborngirl ROFL... yes "acting" an appropriate term. They knew the Russia narrative was a hoax to hide criminality.

<|startoftext|>@Youarenumbee6 @WalkiriaUSA @RightHookUSA Sure since they're here illegally any crime committed is avoidable as they shouldn't be here in the first place. The fed prison system is full of them; so again over 0 shouldn't be occurring. They have 0 right to be here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KurtSchingoethe @1Stubborngirl @RealSaavedra They have no filter because the ends justify the means... these Dems came in bold &amp; brash and got hammered because the narrative they're selling was trashed as lunacy.

<|startoftext|>@Youarenumbee6 @WalkiriaUSA @RightHookUSA Sure thread is about HRC colluding with Russia... so distract with what media do you read? Obvious your still believing the whole Trump Russia hoax or wanting it to be true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WalkiriaUSA @Youarenumbee6 @RightHookUSA Been on a rant... came back today must be bored... trying to infer that DC crimes didn't happen... #SpyingDidOccur<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Youarenumbee6 @RightHookUSA I read the Atlantic the other day... not exactly a right-wing rag... Rueters too... depends on the story... NYT on occasion... like I said I've been watching this play out for a while. Who do I like? @TuckerCarlson &amp; I don't do @CNN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Youarenumbee6 @RightHookUSA No I've been watching all along... left/right is irrelevant... the Establishment &amp; their media lap dogs aren't to be taken at face value... knowing truth takes an effort to find the trees in the forest full of liars.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Youarenumbee6 @RightHookUSA I don't pick a single source... I read many articles... the news by &amp; large perpetrated the Russia Hoax lie... fed by criminals trying to distract from their crimes. 90% bad... shows their complicit nature to spread it far &amp; wide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Youarenumbee6 @LGillon2 @RightHookUSA ROFL... belief in the fantasy narrative Mueller didn't find... have you ever had an actual security clearance? I believe not as you keep throwing shit at the wall hoping something will stick. Facts don't match your dialog... HRC paid Russia for Dossier so try again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Youarenumbee6 @RightHookUSA Sure... the insight of someone who ignores what's in front of their eyes isn't one I accept advice from... the statements made make me laugh... neutral news source... right. Wut CNN or MSNBC? Sure... if you're looking for delusion check the mirror.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Youarenumbee6 @LGillon2 @RightHookUSA Back with more excuses for why they lied about #SpyingDidOccur criminal acts were the reason for all their lying... AG is gonna light up DC.

<|startoftext|>Easy answer, ensuring @realDonaldTrump is reelected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InBed17 @steph93065 @RashidaTlaib ROFL... breaking out the islamaphobia card? Try harder... it ain't a card that's gonna work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steph93065 @RashidaTlaib She's lying to the infidel, but knowing your enemy means that doesn't work. Repeating their statements ensures others are aware of their seditious nature that will see them removed from office.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WalkiriaUSA ROFL... gee AG Barr don't go easy on the Beve. Don't worry Jimmy... we know you're a #Traitor &amp; the Hangeman is waiting for your arrival.

<|startoftext|>@TrumpGirlStrong Walt would run his ass out of the Magic Kindom so fast... his stock options would burn to ash before he had a chance to grab his coat. What a foul #Globalist perv.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1Stubborngirl @AOC @IlhanMN So a NYC resident who's unconcerned about 9/11 &amp; a domestic terrorist's statements about it... cries because she wants to silence critics who've shown her as incompetent? Nah... both are going to hear it all day, every day for being fools &amp; idiots. They're free to resign. #MAGA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hrtablaze @1Stubborngirl ROFL... playing the victim card for being stupid. Apparently she had no idea what it means to sit at the "adults" table?

<|startoftext|>@WalkiriaUSA @chucktodd Cuck has said Russia &amp; collusion so many times its imprinted on the tip of his tongue like a tattoo. He can shove the lying conspiracy shit where the sun done shine as he has 0 credability to claim journalism made him do it. He is a complicit propaganda peddler. #SpyingDidOccur<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1Stubborngirl 44 also knew the Chinese hacked HRC too not the Russians. It's why the FBI didn't demand her server. Crowdstrike my ass. They got his Emails in their haul &amp; our CIA assets paid the price for their willful corruption &amp; trying to hide its discovery.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@m5drummer And is still aiding our Iranian enemy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WalkiriaUSA Ah yes... the bull in the china shop... breaking laws to tear it up. Nah that didn't happen which is now causing fear in the perpetrators. Their House of Cards is collapsing. Wrapping themselves in the laws they abused isn't gonna save them either... it was never by the book.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrumpGirlStrong There's much more than meets the eye... DC is about to get lit. HRC is gathering the wetteam, but are gonna be denied. Others won't be that lucky as those loose ends are tied up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TipsyPianoBar @RepAdamSchiff Sure... you got those #Trump pics yet leaker? We got you for being the "source" your days are numbered. That evidence you've claimed nowhere to be seen, we do deserve better in CONgress for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1Stubborngirl Hmm... so Manning BS? Odd 'cus they freed that #Traitor to walk the streets, but need Assange for passing it along? Sure, that seems highly hypocritical. '44 let the deserter #Turdball walk free too. Something else is afoot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WalkiriaUSA ROFL... sure not a representation of #Commie loving fools? That's why they keep moving like lemmings farther left. NYT trying to pivot from their failed propaganda narrative of Russia 24x7 to just "normal" irl? We've already seen it in their "protests" no normal anywhere in sight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TipsyPianoBar ROFL... you picked a fine time to leave me Lucille... a toofless Negan that nobody fears... ain't gonna find any Sanctuary here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WalkiriaUSA Well at least HRC isn't POTUS... he'd have committed "suicide" by shooting himself in the back of the head already. I wonder what is gonna drop now. Tripwires have been set.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FuctupMike That #Karma is gonna happen to the Ponzi Paid Troll whether he wants it too or not. They've been lying up the propaganda fake narrative since the beginning.

<|startoftext|>@JayhawkLas He isn't gonna even make the stage. Nuk'em already proved himself unworthy of holding power. Threatening citizens will never lead to victory... disarming them won't either.

<|startoftext|>@FuctupMike @sassy1ntn ROFL... nope... it was "spying" it was also sedition &amp; treason... I don't care what the cable news ecosystem calls it.

<|startoftext|>@1Stubborngirl @GeraldoRivera You are always right... this one is a slam dunk. I guess he forgot Paris already just like he did 9/11.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@005_five @SamS_RTR @GeraldoRivera Huh... so JFK had Navy service, but that domestic terrorist saying 9/11 was just some folks doing stuff is his Capone Vault analogy? That's anti-Einstien #Globalist BS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WalkiriaUSA They didn't have one except for lust of power fueled by the narcissism of '44 wanting to ensure his successor was his to hand pick. It's why the "cover up" began &amp; they needed to "mainline" the Steele Debacle into their "Story".<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tedlieu gets torched by @RealCandaceO &amp; he's playing the White Nationalist claim? The propaganda ministry Ted loves to cite gets shown as a lie once again.

<|startoftext|>@1Stubborngirl @RealCandaceO @tedlieu @RepJerryNadler Got to love that!

<|startoftext|>@WalkiriaUSA They can't that's why they insist on censoring others.

<|startoftext|>@PD3598 @NumbersMean @cvpayne @marthamaccallum No need... Trumps not done, but a FED propped up 0% rate environment couldn't even help '44 come close &amp; the rest of the World is still sucking on the central bankers fraud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steph93065 @RuthieRedSox @realDonaldTrump Trump isn't gonna jump 'cus an activist tells him too... the process will move through courts as intended.

<|startoftext|>@mjfree ROFL... brilliant... so now Hitler is a Jew? You really thought that one through. You should probably look at Germany if you're looking for Hitler... Merkel seems to be the spawn you seek. Ignorance of history is no excuse, but thanks for being oblivious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TipsyPianoBar @facebook LOL... #CuckerBot locked me out of my account. Claimed it was for off-platform acts, but my SM accounts aren't connected; so who is connecting those dots? Hadn't been on it in a year; so what TOS violation could have occurred? #FakeBook<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TipsyPianoBar Yes &amp; why UK &amp; AUS used to spy for the US to further subvert the 4th Amendment protections we have while rigging the election for the #Globalists   Ultimate power corrupts all it touches... these two are not immune from that siren.

<|startoftext|>@iheartmindy Well that's all well &amp; good except that it takes a Constitutional Amendment; so are they just wasting time on a fantasy when there's other real work they didn't accomplish? I'd bet yes on a stack of problems they didn't fix.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ManzariRc @RightHookUSA The Corps has higher standards than that. Sand fleas would eat her up. @MCRDPI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RightHookUSA There are only 2 sides to that coin in the military. @AOC an economist by degree proves she knows nothing about at least 2 subjects now. The '44 SWJ experiment is dead at the DoD for battlefield leathality reasons just like her #GND   #Volunteers aren't drafted they have cause.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RightHookUSA That dude rocks... "Tougher" hmm... yep sounds "Better" than not. This ain't like putting a finger in a dike. Those leaks are all along that 2000 miles. Fake Asylum needs to wait outside. #CloseTheBorder eradicate MS-13 &amp; the opioids that are fueling death. F catch &amp; release.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SJVET45 Hey @SenatorRomney I could care less if you don't like @realDonaldTrump's "style" it's why he wins &amp; you lose. U R a #Globalist RINO.

<|startoftext|>@RightHookUSA @1Stubborngirl @RobGosewehr @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump @SecretService @FBI @TwitterSupport @TwitterSafety It seems that's @Twitter's idea of "Healthy Conversations" that threat stays up, others sent to #TWITMO for nothing other than disagreeing with elites.

<|startoftext|>@DreadPirateB @PeteButtigieg Well BMan this is some #BillNye level Science fraud 'cus I sure as shit ain't a plant... a bot, Russian, Nazi, or a Racist either. BTW Pete how many are you taking in?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @dbongino @foxandfriends Well I'll leave this here if your looking for the source of the hoax... how ironic. Feel free to add the others we know she conspired with.  #RussianHoax  https://t.co/XAmgbhdSI1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This should be rebranded as the #NAH 'cus he surely has yet to pay those taxes too. @AOC in blatant pandering lies got #Fraud owned. #Trump has done more for that community than #NAH has since its inception. #WalkAway from the #Commie Plantation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Take a good look #America see who believes they don't have enumerated powers... a demand for power where none exists for them to claim. #Tyrants also do this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mtracey @RightHookUSA We hear none of those successes; so hammer the #EnemyOfThePeople for their lies a financial penalty for the perpetrators. Free Press of the Constitution is not the same as bought &amp; paid for media. There's plenty of examples of their hyperbole to hit them over the head with. #MAGA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mtracey @RightHookUSA Based on the loons seen here, large chunks of the pop just want the hoax to be "True" because 13 dirty, conflicted political assassins couldn't accomplish a coup. #Trump choices have made us safer &amp; more prosperous than political frauds who've sold us out to the lowest bidder...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mtracey @RightHookUSA CNN #'s have cratered have they stopped their lies? Nope... the AG is perpetrating a "cover-up" now. This is based on 0 named sources? Just what's been "heard". Advertisers perpetuate that... to stop it the money needs to dry up...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mtracey @RightHookUSA I'm more inclined to think the media is still working under the assumption that they're "independent" when they're complicit in the disinformation campaign being run by the government. Hold accountable? None in either branch of the propaganda ministry has yet...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepDanCrenshaw Odd... why is it always to increase them? I can think of many things we should be spending less or 0 on. #Commies only know wealth redistribution &amp; that has never worked anywhere tried including CA &amp; NY.

<|startoftext|>@sandune913 @ChrisCuomo Yep... character... Biden? The gaffe machine is a blithering idiot. The fact that CC has 0 sense of humor should be lost on none. @realDonaldTrump just called ol #GropingJoe out... behind the school? Joe &amp; kids again? It's also why #Tucker wiped the floor on their entire lineup.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ROFL... well Mr. Irrelevant good thing you don't controlled that. Fed Gov has that responsibility. #Commiefornia had an @AOC idea... &amp; ya know those are always bad...

<|startoftext|>@1Stubborngirl @RepAdamSchiff @RepSwalwell @RepJerryNadler These #hypocrites insisted the #FISA not be declassified (a legal act by any POTUS) &amp; released to show spying on American Political Opponents... yet insist the law be broken now b'cus they lost the #MuellerCoup &amp; just like HRC want to continue it. #Lying idiots, they are rabid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ROFL odd how that payola just stopped... yep could have predicted that. Donkeys know she's radioactively contaminated by the attempted Coup... who thinks #GropingJoe didn't know too?  #ChardonnayDrunk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmm... @Comey better be warming up on those Bible verses. We already got the Fuk Flynn post from your lackey. #FISA fraud too. That House of Cards is crashing down. @GenFlynn will be exonerated &amp; you will be shown as #Treasonous   #MAGA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DocVoliday @RuthieRedSox @dbongino @almostjingo @RealMAGASteve @KAG4All @SiddonsDan @DonaldJTrumpJr @Jillibean557 @buzzman888 @ArizonaKayte Ran that Op out of the WH as HRC Conspired.   #Treason   #MuellerCoup failed... odd he's run off to see Frau Hitler... egging her on to destroy her Country?

<|startoftext|>@1Stubborngirl @RepSwalwell His fantasy of having those launch codes to destroy the Country just made him a prime contender for the #TrumpCurse   Take a number Eric you ain't got shit for game. Won't even make the stage... #KiddieTable for you.  #Trump2020Landslide vs. #Nukem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@45Wildwayne Careful he might take that as a challenge... look at FLOTUS Nuke'em has got 0 chance.   His narcissism is off the charts if he thinks he'll every be POTUS &amp; who is telling him to run?  ROFL every fool jumping in the Donkey 2020 moshpit to enrich themselves. #Traitors &amp; #Thieves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MAGAGirl10 @RuthieRedSox He's gotta catch CA &amp; NY as peeps and business flee the State. The exodus is real... those taxes are gonna increase to hasten departures &amp; he's gonna be crying he's bankrupt. The District of Shitcago has a certain ring to it though. #ILLExit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@m5drummer @KamalaHarris It won't but using logic with a #Commie only confuses them. We waste too much money on education now... rewarding non-performers &amp; indoctrinators. Fed Gov has no place in education or health care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@parscale @RightHookUSA @realDonaldTrump The suggestion that Government be the arbiter of Free Speech annuls the #1A &amp; is unConstitutional... #CuckerBot must really think we're that dumb while he sells your data w/o asking. CPAC speech said we'd force them to restore free speech not regulate Tech censorship &amp; tyranny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1Stubborngirl Dude has no business having that... his ignorance astounds... oh look what I got... get the vid rolling for muh credits. I don't know any gunstore that would have sold him one; so guessing it's not a legal purchase.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realTRUMPERLAND @Ironhorsemen1 @jack @TwitterSupport @DevinNunes It's the truth... luv to see your content... need more meme challenges... Z's been slacking off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@45Wildwayne That's why they laughed about deleting accounts &amp; getting married if Mueller didn't take #Trump down... that whole sibling thing is still against the law unless your a Congresswoman committing immigration fraud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@45Wildwayne Yep just like that evil dude in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang... sucked them in &amp; rung their bell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnonCalmsClam Talib is pretty thick... most of them are unarmed by the tyrants who rule over them... bringing stick &amp; stones? Good Luck with that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@45Wildwayne They may have they spread it around Soros style to those with tyrant &amp; despot in their blood...

<|startoftext|>@realTRUMPERLAND @Ironhorsemen1 @jack @TwitterSupport @DevinNunes You are the Gold Standard... great stuff needs to be shared not hidden.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@45Wildwayne Oh yes... don't trust'em anywhere near my icecream my money doesn't reward #Commies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@45Wildwayne He's gotta be hanging with Ben &amp; Jerry too... must be some 60's toxic spill in the water there... need the Green Mountain Boys to return &amp; restore order.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@45Wildwayne Cash for #Commies not clunkers... I feel the sic Burn for the mindless idiots that follow his #Venezuela cause.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MicroHonkyTonk @TipsyPianoBar That's what they call Healthy Conversations... the silence of a dying platform is deafening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RightHookUSA The relativism in that tweet astounds... probably why they still have Merkel as their dear leader. The thought that it's all a game ensures the loss not a win... apology... nope nowhere to be found... any hope that it will be forthcoming a delusional fantasy.  #Mankeyd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RightHookUSA BS @realDonaldTrump I've been in IT for 25 years. I am one of the few remaining due to Corps choosing foreign labor over Americans. It destroys leverage for wages when they're ready to kick you to the street for slave labor DHS should be slapped for that assessment. #AmericaFirst<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RightHookUSA LOL... sure the dirty, conflicted 13 fume b'cus they couldn't manufacture the Coup they were tasked with ensuring. Their failure sees it move to the House; so trying to #GasLight Barr to disobey laws as they did isn't going to end well either. AG decides others are irrelevant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SebGorka Except for that Treaty requirement to fund for their own defense. The cost incurred for inviting a ME invasion sucks funds from where they're obligated to spend it. Words mean nothing when in a battle... the enemy isn't giving you a timeout; so you can call the next play. #Frauds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SebGorka Huh... sure private records are not under the purview of CONgress. LE needs search warrants signed off on by the Judicial Branch... they have less power to compel those docs be produced... they don't override Constitutional Rights. Time to stick a microscope up their backsides.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RightHookUSA When you mess with Country's secrets you're sure to make powerful enemies. It's why Snowden is in Russia too. They've tried to lure him out before... how long before the carrot or stick used on Ecuador to cause them to flush the rabbit from the hole?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@subversi0n81 @KamVTV ROFL... #Commie conflation... sure tyrants had great HC... kill people no need to worry any longer about it. 100+ million body count &amp; rising.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamVTV @JessieJaneDuff Intentionally made ignorant of History... ensuring those mistakes will be repeated... &amp; it will be too late when they realize they've been lied to as they fight for scraps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet ROFL... fostered the insurrection in other Countries that now comes home to roost in them thinking they run the Company.

<|startoftext|>@1Stubborngirl @DocVoliday @LucetVeritas @KatTheHammer1 @almostjingo @KimberlyMrsRR1 @Truthseeker126 @RealMAGASteve @TrumpGirlStrong @LVNancy @LeahR77 Well they had to have an excuse for #Treasonous spying; so Russia needed to be their boogeyman. Claiming the didn't read docs signed isn't gonna save their hides either. Just like the unmasking they perpetrated. Official Docs means they attest to whatever it contains.  #MAGA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VoteMcGonigle All of the above &amp; more... or anything someone twists into a TOS violation... claiming words chosen infer a specific meaning or intent that wasn't used as claimed... ever try to dispute? The auto deny stamp is ready, willing &amp; able to comply.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bahamamills @Milove_co @RightHookUSA She used fascist tactics alright... trying to deprive someone of their Constitutional Rights... no Hero there only an unAmerican radical who now faces consequences for that act. #Karma<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TipsyPianoBar Well they made up Russian garbage for 2+ years b'cus HRC lost; so why would I expect them to change now?   Time to indict co-conspirators... let's see them report on the crime of #Treason committed by '44 Admin... that'll "improve" their dispositions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn't this the sign of a #Fraud &amp; #Liar I thought she was boycotting GA... &amp; yet she's in the state... #HasBeen loon has too much time on her hands &amp; yet still hasn't paid her back taxes yet.

Betting they'll get a No in return. Then the IRS will be Putin's puppet too... since they targeted conservatives while '44 ran it, but none were held accountable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RightHookUSA Huh... leaders who've sold out their workers for slave labor, who sit behind high walls &amp; have security...  @realDonaldTrump should be hearing Angel Moms &amp; Dads... the economic hyperbole is coming from elites... not the People.

<|startoftext|>@RightHookUSA Well with #FemiNazis castrating little bois for decades, they needed proof they still aren't physically equal to the #Betas they created...

<|startoftext|>@RightHookUSA @PatrioticVa @DonAustin_PAUSD It's over the top narcissism to believe everyone should think alike. Placing your inner beliefs above others is as unAmerican as it gets. The "Thought Police" just a cover for #Rabid radicals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnCornyn Huh the co-conspirator should... #Treason carries a high price &amp; he was at the center of it while ignoring real crimes... extremely careless = gross negligence &amp; doesn't require intent.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RightHookUSA @PatrioticVa @DonAustin_PAUSD Clearly a sign he is a #Commie then... focused on indoctrination not education... #OMB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrumpGirlStrong Ah yes... the "public" shaming idea that doesn't result in 0 fuks given enrages those claiming moral authority that only exists in their own mind.

<|startoftext|>@Bro69Gender @CityBureaucrat @RightHookUSA No you claim FANG isn't STEM when it is... while trying to say Tech isn't STEM which are both incorrect. None in scientific engineering use sliderules for manual calculations... FANG is way bigger than 1% too.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RightHookUSA Yes, Corps sold their souls in the name of profit... slave labor vs. free men.

<|startoftext|>@marklevinshow Ha, so the cry for censorship continues from the #Comminists You thought it was just users, then Alex, and now they come for many others openly. #StopTheBias   Obvious attack on us from Soros &amp; Media Matters 'cus they disagree with a message they can't refute.  1984 is calling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet Totalitarianism is so wonderful for the economy. Death &amp; misery follows that shadow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SioBabble @gatewaypundit @PrisonPlanet @JonahNRO But, but, but muh grammar police... typo king here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trump_troll_16 @gatewaypundit @PrisonPlanet @JonahNRO Huh, next I'll be Russian or a bot...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeighWright420 @JessieJaneDuff @bfraser747 @BookItCJ A-10... quite the tank killer there... the gatling gun on that beast roars. Glad you enjoyed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carrieksada @zola1611 Not likely considering his NeverBritt stance. An "elite" claiming infallibility only to be shown as a charlatan at every turn. Glad he sees no government criminality, shows he's full Propaganda Ministry... he's cheering on the God save the Establishment crowd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RuthieRedSox @SamS_RTR @ArizonaKayte @michaelbeatty3 @thebradfordfile @Redheaded_Jenn @PinkBelgium @StacyLStiles @jojoh888 @Fuctupmind We don't have lineage or dynasties for a reason in our politics. While the establishment would have us believe different. @GOP we are watching AZ, hard pass on any w/McCain last name. Not hard to find more qualified... Jan Brewer anyone?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lmyprez2 @SamS_RTR @zola1611 @rektredpill @Redheaded_Jenn @VivaAmerica99 @Fuctupmind @1776HotLips @FLeWchie @RubyRockstar333 @DanCovfefe1 @FascistTwatter @jojoh888 @LeahR77 @SiddonsDan Turkey a specialty, pics confirm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SnowflakeZapper Not For Long... future of @NFL  #BoycottNFL bye Felicia not watching this year either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SioBabble @gatewaypundit @PrisonPlanet @JonahNRO Ha sure, sorry not your's to take, you have to earn it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1776HotLips @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @SteveScalise No, censorship is illegal, not over zealous acts. Biased BS bans in response to replies &amp; mass reports too. One sided debates, just like funerals used as attacks. Jak lies &amp; tries to hide what is seen &amp; felt daily by maga, but not the communists of the left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuicideSeattle @VivaAmerica99 Huh, done a bunch, none removed or indicated as violating TOS, yet weak crap used by backroom bois to cause maga bans. So biased as to be obvious, free speech neither understood nor protected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MistaBRONCO @___0HOUR1_ @Fuctupmind @Thomas1774Paine But, but, but... trust the plan, LMAO. Dude is going home, bank on it... he's done little to drain the swamp or fix the mess much less indict any, but MS-13 slam dunks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VivaAmerica99 No the only thing being "fixed" is the election through meddling in the SM environment to censor speech of those they can't refute. Monopolies tyrannically act to steal a message they don't own. #StopTheBias hasn't ended... BS bans to silence voices while public threats ignored.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fuctupmind And yet the DNC isn't raking in the dough. All those Communists must actually like spending their tax reform dollars instead of donating to a lost cause.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fuctupmind @LauraLoomer @keithellison Another accused trying to escape the ramifications of his actions believing himself beyond the reach of law. Obvious conflict in running to be MN AG full of hypocrisy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1776HotLips Huh, she signed spy court docs, the Deep State delay for midterms in hope that things flip; so their criminality will be covered up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VivaAmerica99 Huh, sounds like they've tired of the Globslist approved invasion &amp; woke up... even the Socialists see it as bad, says much. The EU is doomed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VivaAmerica99 @johnpavlovitz @realDonaldTrump Surprised I didn't see a GD America thrown in there... beware false prophets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tulip_Mach_12 @gilbertgrape77 @MaineAntifa FFFFFF  F  FFF  F  F  F   #StopTheBias<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VivaAmerica99 @zola1611 @tedcruz Yes midterm voting to ensure Beta watches his blue puddle #WalkAway replaced by a red tsunami &amp; big turnout for #AmericaFirst<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1776HotLips Yes, the Communists need to sleep through their decline. Becoming less educated ensures their government dependence.  I recall instead, early to bed, early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, &amp; wise.   Seize the day, don't stumble into it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@poconomtn @HazGoneFishing Academia indoctrination has much to do with that as well. The communist revolutionaries pass off propaganda as education; so when they check the idiotnet media reinforces false beliefs as the Deep State writes the script. They censor to keep truth/fact from countering that effort<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thagodthatfaild @conniejwest71 @Thomas1774Paine No, there is no game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VivaAmerica99 RV99 sees the battle for the midterms through us still fighting for victory.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VivaAmerica99 Globalist desire to pervert the economy by commoditizing all of us for low wage scales &amp; max profits. Never concerned with the dumping by foreign state enterprises.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gp2howe @MistaBRONCO @___0HOUR1_ @Fuctupmind @DavidChristoson They were a pair, maybe rock, paper, scissors to decide which of the two would do it? SC needs a new one too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@___0HOUR1_ Like all their other failed narratives... Russia Collusion Impeach Stormy et al NWO vs. Trump &amp; us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gp2howe @MistaBRONCO @___0HOUR1_ @Fuctupmind Two Marine warriors watching a US Senator embracing the enemy. #SemperFi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha, CA loves the #WarPig of the military industrial complex. Such insight from one harassing a woman. Must be mad the PM is a beta &amp; we've got an alpha.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@littlebit727 @VivaAmerica99 @KurtSchlichter Nah, I don't do babble-filled projection, you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fuctupmind They can't, they've weaponized everything else on the altar of the State; so need to go lower into the cesspool of depravity. We must fight against it at all costs &amp; must retake academia; so brainwashing ceases to be the syllabus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@conniejwest71 @Thomas1774Paine Their hate knows no bounds, they refuse to give Trump credit for fixing problems they refused to tackle or wholly enabled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gatewaypundit @PrisonPlanet @JonahNRO Yes its now known as the infowars maneuver. Censorship instigated by your enemies who can't refute the message. Neo-cucks &amp; sore losers would rather silence than debate proving their arguments false. The establishment vs. the People, never bet against those that have been lied to<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet @steph93065 It's why monopolies are illegal, tyrannical action come from those who stifle competition &amp; innovation. They've created a dossier on all &amp; use it now to target enemies &amp; ply the weak mind with lies. Don't be Evil the ex-motto of the Goebbels liars.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VivaAmerica99 This is an example of a communist relinquishing his child to the State. Instead of raising her to be self-reliant she became a statistic because of that fantasy upbringing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SBJDFW Not there to do the checking, but the stench coming from the box should be an indication as there's no way he'd give up his seat willingly. Noxious Green Cloud air quality alert.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LilaMAGA7 Jak doesn't for some reason.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VivaAmerica99 Just like a cracked Kristol ball. Fools who cling to non-existent status in the post-establishment era we've entered. Elitist frauds stuck in the old unable to adapt to new norm in which they have no control.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SnowflakeZapper @AMErikaNGIRLBOT Proof the "experts" in politics &amp; academia are utter frauds. Trump has ripped off the bandage the Deep State used to hide their hypocrisy while selling us out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1776HotLips The ends justify the means. They have no low that can't be eclipsed. Their hypocrisy obvious to many only used as a cudgel by the willing to subvert the return of the alpha on the World stage. Guessing someone is wishing for AC now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@___0HOUR1_ @Jerzygryl @DocVoliday Oops, say it ain't so... soi free zone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods Yes a publics work project to fuel the economy has many other benefits in addition to national security.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DocVoliday @1776HotLips @RubyRockstar333 @TrendingLeft Capitalism, a return to market normalization, the reality that the USA is still an alpha, not a beta. That the government is not your keeper &amp; we have national sovereignty, not open borders. Click the link, nah.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@USMC @Oohrahsemperfi Yes yellow footprints a turning point in lives of the Few, the Proud. There remains nothing that can't be done through improvise, adapt, &amp; overcome. OohRah #SemperFi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PrisonPlanet @Terry47067142 All tyrants... they believe falsely we won't be able to continue on without them, narcissism of the mortal deification. The retention of most minds will prove an utter failure having been forgotten in years, not decades or centuries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VivaAmerica99 They already are, they make things on the inet "disappear". The inet maybe forever, but if you can't see it does it exist? Don't be Evil was the Google motto, they chucked it after they made a dossier on everyone. SM now uses it to target those they disagree with, intentional act<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VivaAmerica99 LOL, Jak would rather see it burned to the ground than allow us to use the platform to win again. Tech tyrants know we are smarter &amp; better informed than Lib drones who only know what they've been told. Don Jr. poasted his desire for a fair, open platform recently tick tock #MAGA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Thomas1774Paine Yes, but he no longer matters now. They use him as a prop &amp; I'm sure he was approving of the idea as his dream of fulfilling his Globalist desires is being crushed by all that Trump is doing. They made Trump the star w/the pettiness shown, re-energizing us for the midterms. #MAGA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ironhorsemen1 @USATODAY LOL. In-N-Out is gonna rake in the cash from a Buycott instead. Libs gonna cry while missing the awesome deliciousness of a Double Double &amp; fries. Losers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1776HotLips @DocVoliday @RealMAGASteve @grizzlemeister @carrieksada @1Romans58 @michaelbeatty3 @RodStryker @GartrellLinda @KatTheHammer1 @TrumpGirlStrong Gonna need to attach a stickup fragrance to the casket, dude's gonna start decomposing at the rate their going, the smell of the Globalist swamp is hard to overcome. #SundayMorning  The Walking Dead irl... sick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MistaBRONCO @___0HOUR1_ Never, modern Pearl Harbor intended to take us down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeckysTidePods @rektredpill Ain't that the truth. Winning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MistaBRONCO @Fuctupmind @___0HOUR1_ @1776HotLips @Redheaded_Jenn TY my friend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@littlebit727 @KurtSchlichter @VivaAmerica99 Could have fooled me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LarrySchweikart @VivaAmerica99 I'd think... media, we have none... it's all propaganda now. But the message from the source gets to us without them &amp; their lies. Concur they serve no purpose until journalism returns to the 4th Estate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KurtSchlichter @VivaAmerica99 They don't think very far ahead, sad  rendition to remember the vitriol of the departed. The establishment lost an acolyte while the Country regained a piece of Freedom. Trump is their President &amp; the AZ seat should be flipped Red.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealSaavedra @VivaAmerica99 There is no desire for "debate" only censorship &amp; submission to the Communist subversives of the left. Funerals are such somber events, was it followed by a fund raiser?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRealBuzz @VivaAmerica99 HW sold their souls to the Globalists long ago, their PC rendition refuses the signify the moment the US Flag was planted on the moon's surface. TY for continuing to honor the idea of American Exceptionalism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stareagle @realDonaldTrump Overturned on appeal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VivaAmerica99 Ride or Die<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VivaAmerica99 Yes kind of like what jak did to me this AM RV99!<|endoftext|>
