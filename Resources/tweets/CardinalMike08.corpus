<|startoftext|>@cnnbrk 2020 is a year to remember. I never thought we’d live in a pandemic nor did I think state elected lawmakers would just plain out ask to not certify votes in states the current president lost. It’s absolutely insane, yet we are living through it. Wild.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan At this point I think we can all stop acting surprised by these things. It will save us a great deal of anger, resentment, and time.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@clairecmc This administration is off the charts crazy. They would lie to Mother Teresa if it meant making Trump look good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThePubliusUSA Yes. Simple as that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DouglasEmhoff @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris You look very Vice-Presidential husbandy!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattyglesias I can’t remember the last time I hugged someone who wasn’t in my household<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN Nothing will stop these Republicans and their agenda. They are more of an “Every man for themselves” than a “Leave no man left behind” bunch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnnbrk @CNN @CNNPolitics @MSNBC will anyone be airing coverage on the #VoterSuppression going on in #Texas from @GovAbbott #TexasVoterSuppression<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC @jonkarl Well if the White House says it...it must be true! 🤔 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC Thank you for taking this virus seriously and wearing your mask when you need. Stay healthy and safe. We need you and Kamala healthy and to win November 3!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBCNews Another attempt at voter suppression. Well, Texans can’t be intimidated. We will be out voting. And we will be voting you out when your re-election comes around.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wolfiesmom @RepKatiePorter I fucking love @RepKatiePorter!!! She doesn’t mess around. Her white dry erase board is the most effective thing I have ever seen. If she ran for president her running mate should be that dry erase board.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You were pretty quick to let us know your view on the Chick-Fil-A issue at the San Antonio airport but silent on letting us know this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovAbbott @GregAbbott_TX I’m looking at your Twitter pages and I don’t see where you posted your proclamation today about limiting the number of mail-in ballots sites to 1 per county. Or as I like to call it #VoterSuppression<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clairecmc I still can’t believe this clown 🤡 is president. He has really set America back so many years. I truly hope @JoeBiden gets elected. Remember just because we have the moment doesn’t mean we have the votes. Get out and vote!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bjneitzel @ananavarro @chrissyteigen @johnlegend Apparently Bradley doesn’t realize he too had a completely narcissistic impulse to share his comment. I on the other hand strongly encourage the Legend family behavior to openly share what millions of families experience and may be ashamed to share. Sharing this will help so many<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN Whoever has an issue with her sharing must have a lot of other issues. Let them grieve their ways, even if it means sharing their journey in public. They may help someone who shares in this tragic experience as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HuffPost Ted Cruz does not speak for all Texans. I’m not complaining to him about CNN or any other news organizations. The length he goes to to bash news outlets other than Fox is incredible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC She loved him before all his success. Good for them. Sounds like an upstanding guy, he knows what’s important in life first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OversightDems @RepKatiePorter I love watching her. She is factual and ready. It’s quite amazing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ananavarro #LockHimUp in a looney bin! Trump acted insane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mayaharris_ @HillaryClinton Hillary be like:  https://t.co/9SBiC87RRk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clairecmc Our country is in serious trouble with this current president.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump is acting like a desperate man!!!! #PresidentialDebate #Debate2020 #BidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh my god! This #Debates2020 is hard to watch. #trump is simply terrible. #BidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowthisnews Trump is the absolute worst. He’s like a crying baby who just cries and cries and blames everyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrBiden Are you and @DouglasEmhoff swinging by San Antonio, Texas??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kellierasberry Well she could actually be a voter...possibly for the wrong candidate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only #FakeNews is that @realDonaldTrump is rich. #VoteHimOut #TrumpTaxes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let’s see what lies @PressSec says tomorrow about today’s tax story. I’m like 1,000% sure she’s gonna say something snarky. #TrumpTaxReturns #TrumpTaxes #BidenHarris #VoteHimOut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer It’s about (New York)time(s) someone came out with a story about this!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump All you can do to sow doubt in the election process is spout lies. I can’t believe after 4 years as president you have not tried to become a better person for our nation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanRather Wow. That was so good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer Americans should not be fooled by Donald Trumps words. He has no plan for healthcare. A proven liar, he will continue lying til his lines his pockets w money and ruins America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was so good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeAnna4Congress Something else very interesting. Trump used to say “Lock Her Up” about Hillary. I guess he was preparing us for this instead.  https://t.co/CXBmkRnMP0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRealHoarse Nobody’s planting stories about your dad winning. Nobody!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@govkristinoem I like how you’re so proud you shot a bird and felt the need to make a video of it. I’ll never understand hunting for sport.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clairecmc @RareCamellia She’s grasping at straws. You could be off by 0.5% and they would say you’re inflating numbers. You keep up your good work @clairecmc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#america is on fire. #DonaldTrump and the #GOP are fueling the flames. The only way to put this out is by #voting him out. #November3rd #BidenHarris2020 #ByeDon2020 #FlipTheSenate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC This makes me sad. Staying with a cheating man (or woman) sets the precedent for them to cheat again. Strength is leaving not staying. Emotional abuse is even worse than physical abuse abuse because you can’t see the bruises, but they are there and will always be there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricTrump Oh honey. This is what you’re gonna pick on him over? Such a sad attempt at trying to shame him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN RIP. Prayers to her family.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ABC This is a job for Brenden Fraser.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clairecmc I am living for your unfiltered interviews lately. You are to the point, just the right amount of sass and full of energy. I love it. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBCNews  https://t.co/ubQKRiPfqT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN So many questions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#2020 is literally the worst year to ever exist. #RGB #RIPRuthBaderGinsburg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC Rest In Power. Thank you for your dedication to what’s right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC Shocking! I’m probably skipping the holidays with family who don’t live in my household, and that’s way more important than sports. I don’t understand why these schools are obsessed with trying to play, especially with the cards stacked against them in every way?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnnbrk Of course he does. This family has no problem lying, under oath or to the American public, it’s all the same to them I’m sure. Just because he is willing to sit down, doesn’t mean he will be truthful or cooperative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ananavarro Is this the best Fox News has?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nytimes How did they know his name?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KENS5 By snickers!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Chrishell7 @netflix @DancingABC Damn girl. You look fabulous. Even behind that mask I can see your smile. Good luck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ItsScarlettBobo The queens! I love watching the creativity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GodisRivera Congratulations to you!!!! Your family is lucky to have such a hard working woman in their lives. Y’all are all lucky it sounds like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A #GenderReveal should happen 1 of 2 ways: 1. when the parents go to the ultrasound and the doctor asks if they want to know gender or 2. When the baby is born! Surprise!!! Nobody other than the parents care what gender the baby is. Even then most parents don’t care either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrinityTheTuck @ItsScarlettBobo Her lip sync was legendary!!!! She held nothing back. I was rooting for @ritabagaz, BUT @ItsScarlettBobo slayed last night and her lip sync will go down in herstory.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowthisnews She showed them!!! Such a cowardly administration. I guess this is the America she wants her daughter to grow up in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowthisnews I’m sure she’s gonna say “he was joking” or “of course he wasn’t implying that’s, his humor gets lost with the media!”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ritabagaz @CraveCanada Good luck. You for my vote. Vive le Baga!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DashaunWesley Duh of course I do. I totally get flowers will die, but they make you smile every time you look at them. If you get surprise flowers, I hope it makes your day and you appreciate them, someone thought of you enough to want to make you happy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MunecaFeliz2 @CNN Like Roger Stone? Michael Cohen? Michael Flynn? Etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN This is the the issue that the GOP wants to take a stand on?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JessicaSimpson Wow. Your kids are so big.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ira Omg. I agree. Watched 15 minutes last night and it was difficult. The houses are amazing, but the realtors don’t bring anything special.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowthisnews  https://t.co/xoZjZJTPH5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ananavarro I’m scared of Trump possibly winning again. The nation is on a course for disaster at his helm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mayaharris_ Heart wrenching<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This. Is. Powerful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kathygriffin It’s so difficult to watch. Its like a wrecked train trying to wreck itself again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kathygriffin She knows Donald Trump didn’t invent Telehealth, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LibertyU Hypocrisy 69. That one sounds interesting 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheLeadCNN @jaketapper @nickwattcnn Good!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ProjectLincoln Jared Kushner!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HuffPost Such a sweet moment. I truly hope she sees her sons again. She seems like a really warm loving woman.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowthisnews So cool. Something as simple as shaving his hair really made her feel amazing and loved. 🥰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kerrywashington @angelicaross I bought 4 sheets last week. It felt good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlairStClair @canadasdragrace I tried to give them the benefit, but they seem deliberately bitchy. Facial expressions say a lot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cnnbrk Very sad news. To live ones life truthfully is the greatest gift you can give yourself. You’ll be missed Chi Chi/Zavion, you lived you’re life for yourself and inspired so many.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DrBiden Cute. So glad he did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickAdamsinUSA Oh honey, is this what you’re concerned about?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@douglasemhoff The fantastic 4!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StevenCanals I would celebrate by calling all the people you love in your life and thank them for being in your life. Tell them your life is richer for them being in it. And also buy something from Cartier and drink good champagne and vodka drinks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamalaHarris @JoeBiden Yay<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ed_grimly @abbydphillip Adults vote by mail too. Just FYI.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @CNN @foxandfriends Did you just thank yourself? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBCNews This guy is just dumb.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ananavarro Yes. Yes. Yes. I’d vote for a speeding ticket if was running against Trump/Pence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrBiden Yasssss. Love you guys. Best of luck.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bethenny Why is everyone so negative? Even non-famous people ask for help via social media. And while Bethenny might be privileged, she doesn’t act it.

<|startoftext|>@ABC Trump needs to be removed from office, preferably right now, we can’t wait til November. He is the most dangerous man in the world at the moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBCNews Well today,  @RonDeSantisFL you are worse than NY! Such an embarrassment. Wishing for a speedy recovery for all those sick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Billyjensen This should be a crime!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowthisnews How do they think this is morally acceptable? Of ALL the names to choose from in the world, this is the one they want?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nytimes I mean, are they still relevant?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBCNews This guy is a nut job. People are dying because of his decisions or lack their of! He’s an embarrassment and he knows it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adamlambert Probably independent so he takes votes away from @JoeBiden. Kanye is a trump fan and is trying to get him re-elected. It’s a gross and dangerous stunt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ExpressNews I hope all stay healthy and home if they can. Every celebration next year will mean so much more if we can just do our best this year to limit Covid cases this year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC Heartbreaking that the leader of America has not addressed the country regarding this. He doesn’t not care about America, just himself.  HE MUST BE VOTED OUT!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN Obviously he knew what he was doing. I just hope he gets voted out. At this point the republicans won’t turn on him no matter what.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A little brightness today. Happy #Pride weekend. #PrideMonth #🏳️‍🌈<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ksatnews can y’all do a better job starting the mayors 6:13pm briefs on time? Y’all know what time they start, yet y’all always break into them almost always after he announces new Covid cases. It’s frustrating. It’s not like it’s a surprise what time he’s starting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@washingtonpost Wtf? How dramatic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC Wow 🤩. So amazing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pulte Morning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NPR If they had any remorse they wouldn’t be at the rally’s to being with. Look at what happened to one of the organizers from a state (don’t recall), she got sick and her daughter is a nurse.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TeamPulte Maybe feature some stories of others helping others?! Other than that, you’re golden. You’re changing lives, even if it’s just a meal or groceries...to some people, that’s life changing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PulteDaily Donate most to our local food bank.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pulte @kayla938 Congratulations Kayla!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wendydavis Good luck. I hope you get elected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CentralMarket Thank you for your reply. I’m not planning on returning the item. But more so just wanted to pass along my opinion so in-turn it could be passed along to your heads of CM Bakeries. Thanks 😊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowthisnews When you look for trouble, you’ll find it. This lady is nuts, she defied police and her and her motley crew cried outrage when she got arrested. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CentralMarket I love shopping here, but I have to say 99% of the time, I’m disappointed with your bakery (San Antonio). Nearly every cake or cupcake I buy is always dry, which is a shame because they are not cheap. Just my opinion, but thought it’s important to share.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RuPaulsDragRace @thejordanconnor Omg when he pulled out that long stem rose, I lost it!!!! 🤩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HuffPost He should have kept walking out the White House<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HuffPost This is dangerous. He is killing Americans. If Obama suggested this, republicans would remove him from office. Why won’t anyone stand up to this man.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nowthisnews She’s probably tons of fun at parties. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN Funeral homes will be at capacity, wonder if he’s putting any restrictions on those.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pulte 🙋🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowthisnews I hope this is her last term as mayor. Can you imagine the person you elected to lead your city to say “I offered my people to be a control group!” I would be outraged!

<|startoftext|>@pulte Absolutely. In San Antonio, the food bank could really use it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC Many immigrants do jobs nobody wants: pick produce, clean bathrooms, cook in your favorite restaurant but you’re ok with that but not ok with them getting government assistance?

<|startoftext|>@DemSocialists @JoeBiden I don’t understand this mentality. You’d rather not vote for Biden, thus basically giving Trump another vote wether you vote for him or a 3rd party. Being s as cry baby because you’re dude is in the race is sad. Get over yourselves.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ananavarro I’m proud @YalitzaAparicio was nominated for best actress, but overall, I agree, the film did not speak to me on the level it has for others, and I’m quite ok that people will disagree with me.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You toss that term around like your hair on a windy day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brands like @Burberry and @gucci are the worst. These designers and many people around them are so out of touch with reality. Apologies are lip service at this point, these people study historical references all the time. Claiming ignorance is ignorant.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ABC Ummmm...your husband shot a teenager 16  times, because he felt threatened. I’m pretty sure if I got shot once, I’d get the hint that the officer meant business, but 16 times is not an accident.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NCHouseSpeaker @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump You’re just enabling him. His trip to NC will cost taxpayers money, and people still will be working for free. This is a publicity stunt that (judging by NC residents comments below), will fail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr Ugh. Just shut up. Regardless of small inaccuracies, overall the guilt is evident. It’s like saying, “officer the guy you’re looking for is 5’11, I’m 5’10 1/2”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse I’m sure it’s gonna be a dramatic. I’m sure you’ll be reading a script, as will be evident with your wonky eye. I’m also sure it will be full of lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC When is someone other than @SpeakerPelosi going to stand up to the traitor president? Everyday his is getting crazier and doing things to endanger America. It’s an embarrassing and dangerous time to live in America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Holding innocent American workers paychecks hostage for your own personal gain and to satisfy your incessant need for winning is sad. You are out of touch with reality. I applaud @SpeakerPelosi for standing up to you unlike @senatemajldr<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ABC That fear that #cohen is feeling is the same fear he instilled in so many people that were shafted by @realDonaldTrump when working for him if they threaten to sue him. He loved to feel powerful and tell people her ruin their lives if they came after his boss. Thanks karma. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump @SecretService Kudos to Speaker Pelosi for standing up to @realDonaldTrump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SecNielsen This administration is going off the rails. Such a disgrace to our nation.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ABC @senatemajldr is an embarrassment to democracy and basic human decency . It’s mind baffling #republicans won’t stand up to @realDonaldTrump. Nobody is in favor of this wall or shutdown yet they act like they are doing us a favor. Men acting like babies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC The master negotiator @realDonaldTrump can’t get a deal done, so he shutdown the government. Such a sad time in American history. #endtheshutdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not convinced dude. You forgot to talk about all the innocent Americans that die every day from gun violence by Americans. #PresidentialAddress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC What time do Voting Lines open? Do you know what number we call to vote if we are against the wall? Is there a separate number to call if we want a new president?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicolleDWallace  https://t.co/mHcmlICOdt<|endoftext|>

Even if it hurts his base they will still love him because they think he cares about them #ResignTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BHGraceMinistry @criha @realDonaldTrump Last October a American man killed over 50 people and injured hundreds more, 6 years ago, a crazy kid killed 5 and 6 year old children. Shall I go on? Spare me your “last week an illegal...” example.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerRyan So many republicans “retired” in 2018 rather than stand up for the citizens who voted for them. It’s disgusting that you chose to quit your job rather than stand up to @realDonaldTrump.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Well, you do think you are the face of America and, so it sorta makes sense they are laughing at what they see 😂.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Just in: confidence in the president at all time low since America started.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I’d say you’re succeeding at dividing the country rather trying to unite us. Everyday you’re president, it’s a scary day in America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I’m not sure if you know this or not, but you literally have bigger things to worry about than @Twitter, like say, running a county. Sad thing is, it’s possible you don’t know any better. 🤷🏽‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec @realDonaldTrump Nothing from this administration surprises me anymore. It’s a constant finger pointing blame game. Such an embarrassment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@enews Here we go with making up nonsense just for a ‘like’. She’s also wearing diamond earring, is that a clue to the baby name?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You know you’re not running this year, right? Because it’s possible that you don’t actually know how voting works.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kelly_clarkson Damn. You are funny, girl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amy_Siskind He’s like Trumps little brother who wants to do exactly what his big brother does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Just when I think you can’t stoop any lower! You are a sad, sad person. People lost their lives, and you are trying to make yourself look like the victim.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisCuomo Do people really still think this is about the flag and disrespecting America?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec Clearly a sign that you’re losing it, much like your boss.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrissyteigen Damn. I hope Kamala never asks if I had a slice of chocolate cake while I was on my diet. And if she does, she needs to be specific about what ingredients were in that chocolate cake and in fact if was really chocolate cake. I love this video.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Oh Donald. You’re such a jokester....favorite President! 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump just curious, what news outlets are not "fake news?" (Asking for 3.5 billion friends).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh. The wrong person in the White House keeps resigning (hint: it's the president). @realDonaldTrump @ananavarro @Scaramucci #themooch<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ananavarro Talk about Brock Turner's case as an example of why women don't speak out and feel helpless when sexually assaulted. Injustice.<|endoftext|>
