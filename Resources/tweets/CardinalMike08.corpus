<|startoftext|>@ABC Thank you for taking this virus seriously and wearing your mask when you need. Stay healthy and safe. We need you and Kamala healthy and to win November 3!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBCNews Another attempt at voter suppression. Well, Texans can‚Äôt be intimidated. We will be out voting. And we will be voting you out when your re-election comes around.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wolfiesmom @RepKatiePorter I fucking love @RepKatiePorter!!! She doesn‚Äôt mess around. Her white dry erase board is the most effective thing I have ever seen. If she ran for president her running mate should be that dry erase board.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You were pretty quick to let us know your view on the Chick-Fil-A issue at the San Antonio airport but silent on letting us know this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovAbbott @GregAbbott_TX I‚Äôm looking at your Twitter pages and I don‚Äôt see where you posted your proclamation today about limiting the number of mail-in ballots sites to 1 per county. Or as I like to call it #VoterSuppression<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clairecmc I still can‚Äôt believe this clown ü§° is president. He has really set America back so many years. I truly hope @JoeBiden gets elected. Remember just because we have the moment doesn‚Äôt mean we have the votes. Get out and vote!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bjneitzel @ananavarro @chrissyteigen @johnlegend Apparently Bradley doesn‚Äôt realize he too had a completely narcissistic impulse to share his comment. I on the other hand strongly encourage the Legend family behavior to openly share what millions of families experience and may be ashamed to share. Sharing this will help so many<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN Whoever has an issue with her sharing must have a lot of other issues. Let them grieve their ways, even if it means sharing their journey in public. They may help someone who shares in this tragic experience as well.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer It‚Äôs about (New York)time(s) someone came out with a story about this!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump All you can do to sow doubt in the election process is spout lies. I can‚Äôt believe after 4 years as president you have not tried to become a better person for our nation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanRather Wow. That was so good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer Americans should not be fooled by Donald Trumps words. He has no plan for healthcare. A proven liar, he will continue lying til his lines his pockets w money and ruins America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This was so good.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cnnbrk Of course he does. This family has no problem lying, under oath or to the American public, it‚Äôs all the same to them I‚Äôm sure. Just because he is willing to sit down, doesn‚Äôt mean he will be truthful or cooperative.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ABC I must have missed that part of the Bible. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs sorry...sorry that he got caught. This is probably not the first time, but hopefully it‚Äôs the last.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBCNews @NBCOUT They literally must have nothing to do. I don‚Äôt know anything about the Baptist church, but I‚Äôm pretty sure their bible/god doesn‚Äôt say, ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt agree with someone go protest and harass them!‚Äù<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReeseW @TheEllenShow Good laughs. I love how Jen is so nonchalant on the phone w Ellen. I‚Äôll be your friend @ReeseW we don‚Äôt need @TheEllenShow or Jen. But if they want to be our friends I ain‚Äôt gonna say no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBCNews I‚Äôm glad the Texas Legislature is focusing on real issues like this, as opposed to less serious issues like gun control. Texas is like Alabama‚Äôs little brother.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBCNews I mean, I was thinking of being gay but wanted to see the Arthur episode first so I can make a decision, ugh!!! Alabama is such a stupid state run by stupid people.

<|startoftext|>@MartinWiener @PeteButtigieg @Fidelio012 1. You‚Äôre the one who initially brought up him being gay, not me. 2. The only person not concerned with his sexuality is @PeteButtigieg, much of the media is driving the fascination with it. But to that point, he‚Äôs not running on being gay, he‚Äôs running on being qualified.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More people are outraged about @GameOfThrones and the water bottle/@Starbucks debacle then they are about #AlabamaAbortionBan or @realDonaldTrump and his administrations policies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HuffPost Donald Trump isn‚Äôt happy!!!! End of sentence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MartinWiener @PeteButtigieg @Fidelio012 So anyways dude, my tweet said nothing about him being gay or that I‚Äôm supporting him because we are both gay. My tweet said he did a good job. Stop trying to nitpick, the world is a better place when you dint focus on what‚Äôs not there.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NBCNews Nobody should be surprised by this, and nobody is. Also, nobody is surprised that @realDonaldTrump @jaredkushner @IvankaTrump @PressSec will deny this. I‚Äôd  be more surprised is they admitted it, but truth telling isn‚Äôt a Trump family value.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBCNews Must be easy for him to sleep with no soul or moral/ethical conscious. The republicans who defend him are complicit if they refuse to hold him accountable.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Just in: confidence in the president at all time low since America started.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre succeeding at dividing the country rather trying to unite us. Everyday you‚Äôre president, it‚Äôs a scary day in America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I‚Äôm not sure if you know this or not, but you literally have bigger things to worry about than @Twitter, like say, running a county. Sad thing is, it‚Äôs possible you don‚Äôt know any better. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChrisCuomo Do people really still think this is about the flag and disrespecting America?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec Clearly a sign that you‚Äôre losing it, much like your boss.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrissyteigen Damn. I hope Kamala never asks if I had a slice of chocolate cake while I was on my diet. And if she does, she needs to be specific about what ingredients were in that chocolate cake and in fact if was really chocolate cake. I love this video.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Oh Donald. You‚Äôre such a jokester....favorite President! üòÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The most dangerous weapon in the world is words. @realDonaldTrump knows this, and uses them with intent. I‚Äôve gone beyond being embarrassed that he is the #president to being scared. #vote<|endoftext|>
