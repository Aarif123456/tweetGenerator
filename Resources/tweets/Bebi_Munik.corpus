<|startoftext|>Dongkiz are Highlight's sons idc  https://t.co/wP6eeSyXkk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkingz and cuteness just like Munik is and he also gets babued a lot bc of baby face and his baby like behavior sometimes. And Gikwang being a top visual with full lips, beautiful tan skin, and being the 2nd oldest and being actors etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkingz it's literally the same with Yoseob and Munik well actually whole highlight (ot5) even in age order reminds me of dongkiz  especially Giseob (Gikwang &amp; Yoseob) and Jaeik (Jaechan &amp; Munik) give me the same vibes Yoseob being the 3rd oldest but fake Maknae and in charge of aegyo++  https://t.co/HWCCe3mU9q<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I will do the same one day when the holidays start a thread of Dongkiz and Highlight interacting. the fact that mostly Munik and Yoseob who are my biases of each group makes me so soft 🥺🥺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fujahna Ja dacht ich mir auch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fujahna same ich versuch die ganze zeit zu erkennen wer das ist😭😭<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>how tf did I find Dongkiz, a group that is so similar to my all time ult group Highlight? And exactly at the time Highlight were enlisting...it's like a gift from heaven<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>tbh I was kinda worried to start a new acc after my main got shadowbanned forever bc I didn't want to leave the acc after I got so many followers and likes...but tunrs out my new acc is currently doing better than my old one. I just need 200 followers more to get back where i was  https://t.co/yGeZkiAorw<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@youngencutie Using our religion and arabic culture to hate on someone or use it for fanwars is even more disrespectful than the stuff NCT did<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@youngencutie Assalamualaikum is basically "hello" nothing wrong with saying that non-muslim NCT antis are making stuff up so nct can get hated or cancelled. They aren't paying attention to the real problematic stuff anymore, they are trying to find new stuff but that stuff isn't even bad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baomihuabr @MUNJ4E Awww this is so pretty and adorable I love it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>saying thank u*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>problematic stuff they did. Don't make up stuff just for fanwars and clout. Also comparing a glowing hexagon to the ka'bah? Are you serious? The amount of fake information are literally silencing the muslims who are trying to tell the truth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can non muslims shut up about NCT?? It's becoming embarrassing for you and frustrating for us muslims. You keep spreading misinformation and trying to make up stuff that isn't true. Trying to cancel them for greeting us and saying thank us in arabic?? Stay with the actual+<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lilxuxi_ also...I have the feeling that some people are pretending to be muslim just to soread misinformation...I'm muslim too since I was born and so many stuff they are saying isn't even true and it makes me sad that not only is our religion used for aesthetic but also for fanwars<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lilxuxi_ I'm actually tired of it...nct needs to apologize for a lot of things, but haters making up things and spreading misinformation and even making people believe it just to hurt the fans and the boys is just making me sad fr<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ttaebreadcheeks @SMTOWNGLOBAL Ik and I appreciate that you are trying to make people understand that our religion and culture isn't an aesthetic but that thing isn't a kaaba it isn't even a cube...whatever it is it isn't a kaaba<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Noorivibin7 @ttaebreadcheeks @SMTOWNGLOBAL same I feel like they want them to be cancelled so mad that they make up stuff that isn't true and even when we tell them it's not like that they still try to make others believe it is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Noorivibin7 @ttaebreadcheeks @SMTOWNGLOBAL that literally isn't the kaaba...why tf would they even use a kaaba??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Noorivibin7 @ttaebreadcheeks @SMTOWNGLOBAL I feel like people are making stuff up at this point it makes me kinda sad bc that literally does not loon like the kaaba nor does it have the shape of it but people keep saying "it's the kaaba!"...I'm so tired of it...ik that this comeback was a mess and they did lots of ca but+<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ttaebreadcheeks @SMTOWNGLOBAL okay but the one in the nct one is actually a hexagon not a cube and I'm muslim too but that doesn't look like kaaba to me<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nakoyukii Oh ok I was unsure bc some people said not to sign any petitions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nakoyukii Idk if I should sign any since a lot if people are saying that it's risky to sign as a non american bc the sign can be seen as fraud and the entire petition will be ruined...rather share the petitions everywhere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>tt // racism, child abuse  pls if you can, take your time to read this. it's really important.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>that's what I'm afraid of that's why I'm grateful for threads with petitions non-us people can sign<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Here you can see one of my ult wreckers pls I love him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fujahna Dein layout essen gkndjfns<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>big fandoms be crying bc their MV's only hit a million in an hour meanwhile Aris are proud that Lupin reached 200k in half a year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boredandsodone When I don't watch Dongkiz stuff I mainly watch lesbian stuff but both things scream gay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boredandsodone me 24/7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom UwU says the one with the most adorable layout I've ever seen💕💕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>correction: I ult Dongkiz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I stan Dongkiz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My layout is so chill<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soobinsmoomin same I want them back kpop doesn't feel the same anymore without them Beast aka Highlight is still popular in korea but newer international stans don't know them anymore and tend to disrespect them even though they were the first non big 3 group to make it big and win a daesang<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soobinsmoomin Same I started gettijg into kpop in 2016 but was immediately falling for 2nd gen first they were more interesting to me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soobinsmoomin yeah I even ulted F(X) for a while I listened to so many groups at once bc I was interested in kpop as a whole not just a group, later I started stanning and ulting Beast and then other groups<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>so atz, tbz and skz are confirmed for kingdom...what if rtk gets a second season with dkz bc the amount of z's are sus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soobinsmoomin literally all the girlgroups I wanted to ult disbanded  F(X), Wonder Girls, 4minute, 2ne1, idfk where T-Ara went, Fiestar etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soobinsmoomin me with 4minute I was about to ult them when I first got into kpop but then found out they alrwady disbanded the same year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soobinsmoomin Me too :(( They were my gg ults :(( I was so devastated when they disbanded<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imagine if 2ne1 was still together CL enters the MAMA stage with H₩A and then the other girls join her with a new 2ne1 song...I miss MAMA 2015<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom Same jgnejgne<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nakoyukii or that one korean child actor who is a boy but played a little girl in a drama I forgot the name<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fujahna I think so too😭😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It literally feels like Dongkiz are the little 4th gen brothers of Highlight and it's so so so adorable to me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stanning and ulting Dongkiz gives me the same feeling I had when I first started stanning and ulting Highlight they give me the same vibes as Highlight ot5 too and it makes me so soft bc both mean the world to me and Dongkiz entered my life when Highlight was leaving for military<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait if he wins one more time he will be alone in the top 3 and will push the others to the top 4 rawr Yoseob you can do it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HAHHAH WHAT WAS HAPPENING?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom thank u💕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This could be my fave edit of mine   https://t.co/fbjArjOkWJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TWlCEJIHYO @OH_mes2 butthurt? if you don't care don't comment lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boredandsodone I'm so grateful you did too! This fandom wouldn't feel the same without you! I love seeing you on my TL and talking to you! I would do anything for you to feel happy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3 more wins for Yoseob to get the top 1!!! you can do it bebi! and if he wins for the 10th time he will be the only first place<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it's funny how both my fandoms are always so excited for King Of Masked Singer bc Lights are excited for our King Yoseob who got his 6th win today and Aris are excited for our babys Munik and Jaechan (sometimes Wondae) who are watching the show<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO LOSE BC HIS BABY PIC WAS REVEALED LIGHTS CLOWNDOM<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>pls follow hiko she is so ckose it 800<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>periodt. they deserve so much love and support<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zimzalabangtan yeah that was good that's why I said that I don't dislike them but their comment was still hurtful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zimzalabangtan yeah and no one said anything they all kept disrespecting dongkiz in the fomments and qrts and I just had to adress how disrespectful it was<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zimzalabangtan tbh I can't sit there and watch them treat Dongkiz like that. I for sure don't want a fight or anything but they need to know how hurtful their comments can be sometimes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zimzalabangtan exactly I was pointing out how hurtful their comments were I wasn't attacking them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fujahna ich kann fr ohne reference ned zeichnen kfnskfnns<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fujahna Leicht gesagt fjdjfjdnn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ByulbitBerry oki thank you I'll do my best<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fujahna how 🥵<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fujahna do I look like I have an own artstyle??😭😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay reply with a kpop group or artist and a random artstyle you want me to draw them in you can comment as many groups/artists and artstyles as you want. I want to improve my drawing skills bc I haven't been drawing for months so I forgot how to draw fr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I still want to see Seoham nextto Munik :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom I LOVE U EVEN MORE AAAAAA😭💕💕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>anyways orbits and aris should become friends now bc Aris don't want fights we just want respect. And Loonakiz are about to become friends too. They already interacted a lot like Gowon killing Munik in pubg. Iconic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And we were honored to have our small group win an award together with a big group like Loona. We were so damn proud. We still are. So pls let small fandoms and groups be happy and don't treat them like they don't deserve the same amount of love as yours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Again. I'm not trying to fight. Just wanted to say how it was hurtful to us and I'm asking big fandoms to pls respect small fandoms and groups pls I'm begging. It's already hard for us. Pls let us be happy and be proud of your faves and our faves too. We were proud of Loona too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fujahna @TheLoonaTheorie exactly. just bc it was a year ago doesn't mean it shouldn't be addressed. I don't doslike the person who tweeted that bc they called dongkiz cute and hardworking and linked a mv but it still was hurtful how they felt offended by Dongkiz winning the same award as loona...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheLoonaTheorie I'm really not trying to start a fight. Pls don't take it that way. I love both groups so much. And don't want a fight. I'm just trying to bring this back to say how hurtful it was and how no one addressed this issue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fujahna exactly and just bc I talked ajout hoe wrong this tweet was I get accused of trying to start a fight like...where tf??? I didn't even offend anyone. I' just saying that it was hurtful how they treated Dongkiz as if they didn't deserve it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheLoonaTheorie Tf who said I'm trying to start a fight? I' just saying that people should respect other groups no matter how popular or underrated they are I love Loona and they deserved this award. Just like Dongkiz. I'm bringing this up bc I noticed how no one talked about how hurtful this is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dongkiz are so hardworking and deserved this award 100% ald they deserve even more. You won't ever see Dongaris bringing down other groups bc of Dongkiz bc we are proud of our boys no matter what and we respect other groups. Be respectful ffs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really don't understand why they all in the comments and qrts felt so damn offended bc of Dongkiz winning this award...It fr just makes me sad. They said that Loona isn't being taken seriously and are being treated like nobodies just bc Dongkiz won the same award.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sick of fandoms of popular groups thinking underrated groups don't deserve the same as popular groups. Dongkiz deserved this award as much as Loona did. I love AAA for giving Dongkiz a damn chance.This could be the only award they've ever won so pls let small fandoms be happy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember when orbits felt offended bc Dongkiz won the same award as Loona? They basically called Dongkiz nobodies with this. Meanwhile Dongaris were proud that Dongkiz won an award. Why can't y'all be happy that your faves won an award? Why do you have to bring Dongkiz down?  https://t.co/YcDbB8FeXj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tbzverykhamsa @jchngmn02 I can't write today I'm sorry khndlgnd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I still cry watchinh this. They deserve this so much and much more!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>not to forget how they are the role models of so many kpop groups<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tbzverykhamsa @jchngmn02 saw it as good opportunity to bring some attention for our boys and yes "Lupin" got some more views more bc of "who dis"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tbzverykhamsa @jchngmn02 armys love to accuse so much like any other fandom thinks it could be a coincidence or sample or sth  like when secret numbers debut song had the same soukd as Lupin by Dongkiz we didn't accuse of plagiarism we simply thought "probably same producer or sample" and we++<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I love how in both my ult groups the fake maknae is always in the middle being the adorable hyung of the maknae line but being the baby of the hyung line Yes I'm talking about Munik and Yoseob<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fujahna kgzgdjh true that's why I said BL with Dongkiz maybe there will be a plottwist and not Jaeik will be the couple but Wonik rawr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the way I just slept until now and dreamed that Jaechan and Munik acted in a new drama and had a kiss scene together hfhfehf maybe I predicted a BL with Dongkiz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyways, WELCOME BACK GIKWANG 🥺 I MISSED YOU SO MUCH  #고생많았어_기광아_전역축하해  You've done so well! @900_330  https://t.co/6oel52V8y8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marita79608706 I'M SERIOUSLY SO IN LOVE WITH THIS WOMAN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like if you don't know After School and Orange Caramel doesn't mean she isn't famous it means you just don't know some of the most iconic groups ever...that's okay but calling her not famous and unknown is just seriously so stupid just look her up before you talk bs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't want to see any armchairs disrespecting queen Nana like I will punch y'all istg  If you don't know her it's your problem. Calling her not famous or unknown is embarrassing. She has always been popular and a household name in korea.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lovely_wondae AWW OMG HAPPY BIRTHDAAAAY HOW OLD ARE YOU NOW? 🥺🥺🥺  https://t.co/GBqbIqe1Ps<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fujahna we gotta ask them I hope Wondae will go live soon one day and we can ask him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fujahna I first quote retweeted it bc I didn't see the hairstyle clearly so I thought it's just long hair in a ponytail but I realized afterwards that it could be braids<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fujahna i never knew this performance even existed until now. and it's weird that they never used this again...maybe the stylists realozed afterwards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fujahna they are for sure not the ones deciding it they already said that the company chooses their hair since Jaechan said he wants white hair but the company doesn't allow him but we still should educate them if it's the case. And I'm still curious why they never posted pics of this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fujahna we should tell them and ask them about it when we get the opportunity to<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fujahna yeah true the dance is really fast my eyes cant keep up but this pic really looks like braids<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fujahna it reminds me of this Hongjoong hairstyle from far away it can look like braids bc of the thin locks when the hair boukced up at this part it looked unbraided amd I can't see cornrows but maybe I need glasses  https://t.co/DgqvVyMC8T<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fujahna it kinda looks like braids but the video has such bad quality it could be anything we could maybe ask them in a vlive or sth I wanna be sure ufff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zimzalabangtan yes I just want to know so I can be sure but I think it's good that they didnt use it more. I hope we can find out and either be relieved that they didn't use braids or educate them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zimzalabangtan maybe we can ask them one day I really hope these weren't braids uff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zimzalabangtan and here the ends don't look braided either but I really cam't tell maybe my eyes are bad uffff why aren't there any behind stage pics?  https://t.co/0qe54s08rj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zimzalabangtan here it looks normal but then ik other scenes it looks critical  https://t.co/dBenwGboWP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zimzalabangtan ufff I cant find it anywhere on yt it's so annoying  it sometimes looks like a normal pomytail but with locks and them it looks like it could be braids<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zimzalabangtan damn :( I'm glad they didn't use it more when did this happen?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i wanna see the hairstyle closer but I cant find the stage rawr<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pepikesh @MBC_entertain it's Jaechan from Dongkiz Dongkiz is very underrated and the international fandom hasn't seen it yet I guess so I'm not surprised that the comments are filled with kim lip<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cherrymunik HAHAHA they are fr the funniest<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lovelyshinwxn lmao this was way too funny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>for me it's them singing this iconic turkish song from an iconic turkish drama 😭 too beautiful    https://t.co/SfUve6UNeg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>what's a dongkiz moment that doesn't feel real?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm still laughing because of the sound at the end😭😭😭  https://t.co/lPMPleVXzL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I ngl cried because of this. It makes me so happy...  https://t.co/NP669bVNzQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J4ECHAN 🥺🥺💖💖 no problem just telling the truth it's so beautiful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sorry but why was that "aa~" sound at the end to funny? 😭😭😭😭 https://t.co/lPMPleVXzL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J4ECHAN 🥺🥺 this sounds so mesmerizing and calming wow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>JJFJDJFND<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kinda funny how in germany us turkish people are often stereotyped as lazy and stupid. And now they are saying "why is their ethnicity so important? It doesn't even matter if they are turkish" when people talk about the turkish couple from germany who invented the corona vaccine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stanning Dongkiz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fujahna Ja ik aber tiktok hasst mich und meine videos werden zurzeit immer shadow banned es ist so ew<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can people just stan Dongkiz and not want them to be another group they already stan? Literally for example: Dongkiz: *covers a turkish song* The comments: "is this b*s? I wish this was b*s. B*s would do it better. Pls b*s do this too. Waiting for b*s to do this too" mf stan dkz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fujahna People just want dongkiz to be their faves so they dont have to stan dongkiz too even tho they clearly like them...like I saw people saying that they are armys so  they can't stan dongkiz too...like wtf I'm losijg braincells<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's literally so embarrassing since you can clearly see this isn't bts (names in the subs, 5 members singing in way different voices than bts, 5 members on the poster in the back, the dongkiz # etc.)  https://t.co/T4DEpyJPNf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But this one got me mad. Like if calling yourself an army but not getting how this is clearly not bts wasn't embarrassing enough. You went and said: "I thought it's bts too they are singing beautifully but bts would sing it better hih😂" embarrazzing...  https://t.co/MUnL8Jkdsn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here one out of hundreds of examples (this ones okay but look at the likes like why did they all think this bts?): "Me who thought it's bts for a moment 😌 istg at first I thought bts was singing a turkish song but it's another group 😳👍❤💖😍 they are singing so beautifully😌"+  https://t.co/SBAg1pBoBx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It made me cringe so much like why do they always do that? ++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🥺🥺🥺💕💕💕 what did I do to deserve such precious and nice moots and friends I love all of you so much aaaaa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But what they do is ignoring dongkiz' existence and thinking they are bts or wanting them to be bts. I love both dongkiz and bts but like can armchairs f*ck off? The comments under the dongkiz turkish cover tiktok that went viral on my tiktok annoyed me so much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or like that one oh nana challenge tiktok munik posted on their official tiktok got so many views and the comments were saying he's Yoongi or Jimin...like wtf. I hate it when people do that. I mean I'm saying Munik reminds me of Chuu bc they are both adorable and my biases...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fr idk why they always want Dongkiz to be bts it's so weird like when I posted the dongkiz video where they covered a turkish song. Too many comments where like: "Is that bts? Bts should do this too! Bts pls do this too! Waiting for bts to do this! Bts would do it better!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes I did 🥺💕 thank you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🥺🥺🥺 I'm so glad you like my tweets I always felt boring before but since I made this acc and made so many moots I feel so much happier🥺💕💕💕💕 Thank you so much<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Remember when someone asked me why I hate BTS because I was mainly posting Dongkiz on my tiktok acc and I never even mentioned bts anywhere....oh so being a Dongari makes me a bts anti...they are literally bts stans bruh<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dongkisses Exactly 🥺 but SM would mistreat them so they better stay in dongyo grr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom @WhoIrene They would let Wondae everywhere bc he is the biggest allrounder kcnfkg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imagine Dongkiz suddenly disappears...one day SM announces 5 new members for NCT...and their names are Seol Wondae, Lee Kyoungyoon, Jang Munik, Park Jaechan and Kim Jonghyeong. I can see how NCT would turn even more chaotic and Wondae being the happiest boy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom He is seriously the funniest gkdbkgfn hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom Ikr it's annoying when people ask them to speak different languages lile tf...but I just love how Wondae reacts to them gkkfkgnf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Speak in english pls I really can't understand you" "Don't worry, be happy♡"  "Speak english pls" "...what?"  "Can you pls talk in english?" "Of course. What do you want?" *continues speaking korean*  "Don't ask him to speak english or I-"  LMAO  https://t.co/yBPHZqDbrP<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hi5hli5ht_4ver @namsyu You're welcome💕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zimzalabangtan Thank you 💕💕 it means a lot to hear that because I was going through it all alone and couldn't tell my family since they are so toxic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zimzalabangtan From my point of view what you do is probably just a normal habit. Not really sth to worry about. But sth you should probably change to be healthier. I really need to change my eating habits for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zimzalabangtan Tw // ed, bulimia , anorexia But ed's can can have many different forms. The ed I was talking about when I said I counted calories was bc I wanted to lose weight so badly that I thought of not eating for days and working out until I faint. And everytime I ate I would throw it up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zimzalabangtan Tw // ed , food For example today we woke up at idk 2pm and ate our first meal. And then we ate again at I think 8pm. And now bc I feel like it I'm eating multiple cookies at 1am. Like it's really unhealthy but that's just what I'm used to since childhood...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zimzalabangtan TW // ed  But maybe it is a normal thing to do for some people. I mean I and my family never had normal eating habits. For example our "breakfast" is normally at 2pm and I usually dont eat at school only if I crave sth. And sometimes I dont eat until 4-5pm bc I'm too lazy++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zimzalabangtan Tw // ed  I did that when I had an ed I usually ate under 500 cal a day. But I stopped long time ago because I got really weak and was failing in school bc I couldn't concentrate anymore and skipped too many school days bc I always felt so sick.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@byeongrans Yes he's from dongkiz uwu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn't Yoseob going to be the idol with the most koms wins if he wins 3 more times?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Minhyuk really danced with Dongkiz and talked about Yoseob😭😭  He really interacted with both my ults on the same day and place<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Beautylight4 😭😭😭 this is the second time I see Dongkiz on Highlight twitter. Both my ult fandoms vibing together<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Honey11870331 @MBC_entertain @OfficialMonstaX Yes they are way too precious that's why they immediately became my ults after stanning for one day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AteezStar35 @MBC_entertain @OfficialMonstaX Not yet but they upload vlogs on their yt with subtitles Most of the videos are translated. Only a few aren't bc yt removed the community translation thing but they recently started translating the videos again so yay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imseobim Aaah okay thx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AteezStar35 @MBC_entertain @OfficialMonstaX Awww that would be amazing bc they are so underrated. It always makes me so happy when people want to check them out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who did Yoseob win against? Minhyuk?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Honey11870331 @MBC_entertain @OfficialMonstaX Munik and Jaechan from Dongkiz. Munik is a guest every episode since I think ep 138 I dont remember and he always takes another member mostly jaechan with him. And KOMS always wants them to go on stage to dance with the singers and they always do amazing performances  https://t.co/wc9K3fGiip<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MBC_entertain I was actually expecting them to do the actual choreography like they (Dongkiz) did so many times but nah Dongkiz is always going to surprise me with originality hfhfhb ults for a reason  https://t.co/gsVUERsmoh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AteezStar35 @MBC_entertain @OfficialMonstaX They are Munik and Jaechan from Dongkiz Munik is a guest in every episode these days and he always comes with a member of his group mostly Jaechan and KOMS always wants him to dance with the singers. And smh they always make plammed choreographies or know every single dance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here in germany we don't say "we've reached 23k daily cases. We should close all schools!😳". We say "let's open the windows so covid just flies out on it's own 🥰"<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ajunicebot I'm turkish and I go by Ren but that actually could be the name of anyone right? Qnd I don't like my real name bc everyone butchers it and no one can pronounce it. So it's pretty much the same with your name. Many people told me mine's not normal too.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>TW// weird fast noises, flash warning  You just watched the entire fever MV in 2 seconds  https://t.co/0wK13yfWTg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still thinking about Wondae wanting to bite Munik's cheeks because he's just too cute like a baby  https://t.co/E89ldZNFYD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gayyedam 07????? HE IS 3 YEARS YOUNGER THAN ME?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lightforlife89 And no one is thinking about "maybe they are trying to protect Yong too by not mentioning him and stuff." Like yk everytime there is news about Yong knetz attack him for no reason. So imo it's better if they don't mentiom him. Yong will be safer and the group too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And he is still under around us. The boys are still in contact with him. As group they will be seen as 4 from now on but Yong is still part of their family don't forget that we don't know about their private lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously you cannot expect the members to risk their careers of 11 years. Yong left on his own will. He knows what's good for the group. He probably agrees to be cropped out or never be mentioned bc he cares for the boys and the group. ++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you really think it's not hard for them to go on as 4 members without Yong? We should know that they never cancelled him or hate him bc they know that he did nothing wrong. He is still part of their family but not of the group anymore.++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tbh it's annoying me how some of y'all accuse the boys of throwing him away and being fake friends and stuff. Like do y'all not get how their careers would be at risk bc netizens are way too ignorant?++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fujahna I hate it here. So many people like even a teacher got tested postive and only a few people were put in quarantine for 2 weeks and school still isn't closed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn't it sooo funny how everything in germany is closed except schools and we are getting like 20k new cases everyday (21k today). But they just say: Go to school, wear your masks and open windows. I hate this country<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom KBFKDJFN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkisses Thank you 😏💕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Explanation: - JC, JH &amp; MI doing "tasks" - WD smiling suspiciously and then killing JH (blue lego fell infront of his face) - KY saw in cams that JH and MI were dead - KY &amp; JC started to discuss who killed them and agreed to vote WD out - WD was imposter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#DONGKIZ: There is 1 imposter among us  https://t.co/vQL0OaKe39<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@squishyhw I still ult them it's been 4 1/2 years and still haven't dropped Beast/Highlight once<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's so funny to me how Nom by Dongkiz reminds me so much of Among Us like they look like they are doing tasks and in one scene it looks like Kyoungyoon is checking the security cams lmfao what if they really tried to pull an among us concept?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@assc0ups Fr I feel like he's aging backwards<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TikTokSupport can you pls help me? Tiktok keeps shadowbanning my account for no reason like my videos only start to get views in like 1-2 hours and when it gets views it's always like 50 views or sth<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm so sure that if any of Dongkiz' songs was released by a big group it would've been nominated for soty especially Lupin or Beautiful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait is emotional support idol okay?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh I never made this connection before I'm sorry for ever using it for my emotional support idols. I will from now on use other terms<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Some people on tiktok asked me what Dongkiz fandom name is🥺 and they said "I only was an "______" before but now I am an "______" and a dongari" last time it was an exol who said that🥺🥺🥺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boredandsodone Jrjifjej<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I literally just realized that there's someone (probably Wondae since he is seen standing up in the next scene) laying there at Munik's part  https://t.co/SOxPz6olBp<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>TW// death mention  Translation: "they are singing beautifully but one of them died and the group disbanded"  Ehem excuse me? Idk which group you are talking about honey. But it's not about Dongkiz. So wtf?  https://t.co/Q4vexOFhES<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@youngencutie You're welcome🥰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom It was so funny since they were doing a posing thing for the fans and then Jaechan comes in with a tissue in his hands saying the host has to show his abs lmao  https://t.co/MmEPmg8iKb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom Yeah lmao and Jonghyeong was sad bc he couldn't see it and the host told him that he will show it to him later since he is still 18 lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom Same ufjfybdjv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jonghyeong tried to tell the members hands apart again but this time he failed lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The members asked the host to show his abs lmao  https://t.co/3fQFv6um2q<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bruh they were aksed what their hobbys are and some members said exercising, listening to music, photography etc. and then there's Munik who said "acting dead"...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lovelyshinwxn Twitter is every new kpop stan trying to learn idol names<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>won't let him dye his hair Munik said since he dyed his hair a lot already he wants to try some darker colors Kyoungyoon said he doesn't really care about haircolors and the others said that dark/black hair suits him the most And Jonghyeong said he wants to try dark blue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I'm finally watching the whole Dongkiz turkish fanmeeting video and they all answered a question about what haircolors the members want to try out Wondae said he likes black the most Jaechan said he really wants to try white hair but the company apparently++<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@marita79608706 Thank you so much :( ily💕 my parents are both assholes istg if they were american they would be trump supporters. I hate them with my whole heart. Like he is so against abortion but can't fucking be a father. He barely comes to visit us and doesn't care about our well-being.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@muumiheikko I'm about to. He literally called me a feminist like as if it is offending. Motherfucker I'm a proud supporter of women rights.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fiadeul Best thing ever ifbdjfnd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@muumiheikko Ikr he is the biggest asshole I know. He is literally shaming women for having sex. And calls them lazy if they don't carry the baby...I feel so disgusted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He said the thing he hates the most are gays, lesbians, feminists and women who abort babies. He told me to have a heart for the babies and that I am heartless for saying it's the woman's choice. He even said women shouldn't abort just because they are too lazy to carry the baby.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow my father is a pro-lifer and the worst of them. He is shaming women for having sex and then aborting babies. He is calling me a bad person for saying that it's the woman's choice to qbort the baby. He keeps saying that the woman HAS to carry the baby if both are healthy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sokwantha Yeah true I hope Munik is Harley or I'll cry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do I have the feeling  Munik is Harley Wondae is Joker Kyoungyoon and Jaechan are either Genie or Dracula Jonghyeong is Chucky?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Praying for Munik being Harley and Wondae being Joker like pls and also "Daddy's little monster" kfjdkfkd help<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J4ECHAN And then proceeded to smell him and call him baby<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wondae literally called Jaechan a kitten, smelled him and then called him a baby (i think he said aegi which means baby) in less than a minute  https://t.co/9alBDGubx2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me @ Wondae for stealing my heart :(  https://t.co/OGQOGBdZi7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fujahna I mean I'm not saying they are officially boyrfriends or sth I'm just saying that I'm pretty sure they know that they are being shipped and they probably don't care since they cover these dances to most likely attract the shippers and they are still so close together<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fujahna I don't think they would be uncomfy to be shipped when they literally cover Troublemaker and Fever like this. They probably know they are being shipped and yet nothing has changed they are still so close and cute<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kr_now @dongkiz_dy It's something on my birthday but idk what it is ofjdkfndn<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@allkpop Gikwang isn't even discharged yet but already busy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamaclown0 Yes they are amazing and smh it's bothering me how most people are voting "disagree" without knowing who they are :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@togekissee No but it's weird but cool...apparently robot members or sth I didn't really get it tbh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@my_seezn @Highlight_AUent @official_ACE7 Chill he isn't even discharged yet cjbejfjd Highlight members always busy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ilikecatboys Dongkiz...I hope you didn't vote "disagree" without knowing who they are  https://t.co/lRXkWqTxVi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The group with only all-rounders The first 2 members singing are the main rappers like listen to their power  https://t.co/lRXkWqTxVi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can see how more and more non dongari's and kpop stans who don't know them are voting like if you don't know them just skip how do you wanna know they are the best or not if you don't know them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@newkidder IKR IT'S SO AMAZING I LOVE HIS VOICE SO MUCH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@newkidder YES! I was shocked too when I first started stanning. And a few days ago I watched a reaction youtuber reacting to dongkiz for the first time and she kept mentioning how amazing his vocals and voice are fkndkf   https://t.co/QC9lbG3yFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Istg under every german tiktok video about calling out racists there are mainly stupid and uneducated people trying to defend such actions and most of them are grown like I can understand when a child like 12 or sth doesn't really understand such things but like grown people...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Black or educated german tiktokers: *call them out* The white germans in their comments: "they meant it in a good way", "stop overreacting🙄", "y'all too sensitive", "I don't get the problem tbh they are showing support..."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TW// racism, black face No one: German tiktok: "human is human no matter which hair or skin color" *paints half of their faces black and get thousands of likes for that*  https://t.co/gy5tnHim9a<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The ones voting "disagree" probably don't stan Dongkiz bc damn they got good vocals. 3/5 are main vocals imo. And 2/5 are lead vocalists imo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All 5 members are amazing vocalists and all of their voices are so different but beautiful and they all have such great vocal ranges uff. They even slay in different languages like they sang a turkish song and I got goosebumps bc of their voices it was soo beautiful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Munik just amazes me with his beautiful deep but still so cutely smooth voice his voice is really special and his performance at KOMS was soooo amazing and he is just a sub-vocalist like he deserves lead vocalist too And Jaechan's singing voice is soo pretty and mesmerizing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I seriously thought Wondae our Main Rapper was the Main Vocalist without any doubt until I found out he's the main rapper and Lead vocalist. And then I was confused if Yoon was the main vocalist or Jonghyeong bc those vocaaals.🔥🔥🔥🔥 ++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes but y'all just aren't ready for that conversation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gayyedam Same woth germany I always forget that some other countries don't recycle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom This ones a trend in germany lmao it's so accurate like it's not even a joke anymore they all look like this Not the first outfits...I wish they would look like that...but they all look like the second part 🤢  https://t.co/fenZ3qt4KZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom Yes and german in general just sounds bad in music in anyway possible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom I have the feeling UK and germany are so similar like even the clothing I've been seeing some tiktoks showing how the guys dress in UK and it's so similar to germany They are literally walking around like this in here  https://t.co/uO7UQpedS3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom But this is still okay most other raps are literally so stupid most objectifying women and being racist and homophobic. That's why kids in my class for example are literally the most punchable and disrespectful people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom The lyrics are just too cringy and the raps just sound extremely bad like I just can't understand how someone listens to that and thinks "yes a bop" The lyrics literally are: "And I park the Lamborghini infront of the Lafayette (yes) I won't get towed bc everyone knows Capi (uh)"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom You don't know how much I hate german rap ckdnjfdn if you knew german you would understand ginnejdjne<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@vimyeo They teach us stuff...in a very weird way jxjdkdj smh as kid I really enjoyed these stories lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vimyeo You haven't seen what we german kids read in kindergarten Struwwelpeter stories were so wild TW // Starvation, death This storys about a boy not wanting to eat his soup and then dying of starvation bc of it but there are only stories like this in the book  https://t.co/Li9i6j5Xjm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom The cases are now way higher than in march/april  https://t.co/V08eTRuucd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom It's not gonna help they just force us to go to school. The cases are increasing everyday and even if we get put in a lockdown again guess who will have to go to school again earlier than some others. Yes me because it's my graduation year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom I hate german schools istg our cases are now up to like 15k per day but germany is like "You have to go to school, let's just open some windows for fresh air it will be okay👍" like wtf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom This can't be me because in my school and in most schools in germany they are way too strict with phones. You are not allowed to use it without permission from the teacher and they could take it from you if they see it out of your bag or pocket<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkingz PLS I'M LAUGHING WAY TOO HARD<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@J4ECHAN I knew you from IG as J4ECHAN first I think but Dongk1zs looks familiar too. But I think I once downloaded every dongkiz edit I could find on IG before I joined Twitter and there were a lot of your edits. You were one of the first Ari's I've known<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tiny 16 years old Munik when he entered the company and wanted to make friends with Wondae but was ignored by him the whole time<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@zimzalabangtan One of my first ever edits 🤧  https://t.co/o2dsgjzne8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've lost all my hope and braincells  https://t.co/vYSj1Bm35C<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guess what I'm studying german by writing texts about Dongkiz so I can memorize how to write those texts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom We really need to study now!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaehomungi Thank you and I know jfnsjgnd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can you guys tell me to study like in a really mean way because I've been clearly procrastinating way too much and I have an important exam tomorrow and haven't studied at all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@choerryinred Yeah fr like when will they start doing research for the things they do Stylists and stage/mv designers are like: This looks pretty let's use it and not look if it's offensive or not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@choerryinred I think it's okay to defend the boys for the designs and outfits because it's not them choosing it how the stage should look or what they are wearing But no one should defend taeyong for that one move he did on stage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@choerryinred :( me too but why do stage designers and stylists never do their research? It's not only insensitive and ignorant but also ruining the idols reputations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The MV didn't have anything to do with islam but this...who tf designed the stage? Pls don't use mosques or islam in general as aesthetic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I mean you shouldn't reveal him but...tbh everyone already knows it's him lmao his voice is just too unique<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He knows we love selfies without snow filter😍<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I mean he said that the manager told him that the songs meanings weren't good but he probably didn't get told what the meanings are. He probably doesn't even know who she is :(. He should've done some research to the song before apologizing so he could understand the problem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom @fiagrl We are really so similar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__realwoo @kevz210 Idk how they wouldn't know the meaning of the video...maybe bc of all these tiktoks they thought it's a dance challenge or sth I really don't know but at least he apologized quickly and the company didn't swipe it away but it's not my place to accept the apology<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Liaufae @Jae_Day6 I also thought he shouldn't apologize since it is human nature to be fed up sometimes. But some people felt hurt and he can at least say sorry or sth. But he needed to apologize for the other thing which he already did.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@fairyyuto Me too they made me lose the love I had for bts it's just sad fr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fairyyuto Bruh she really didn't even say anything hateful against bts at all but armchairs keep harassing her...that's why I left the fandom long time ago wtf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fairyyuto I think armchairs are bullying them for something I doesn't seem like they said something bad but armchairs still attack them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@caphongjoong Pls let me know i'm getting anxious tf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lyna_hill @underratedkbops Ikr omg and they say they aren't their style without even listenting to them and then complain about how kpop music is getting boring or they keep complaining about problematic idols but won't stan the most unproblematic groups like dongkiz and m.o.n.t :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've been thinking about this all day since you sent us this in the whatsapp gc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@underratedkbops We literally got 4 comebacks this year and we expect a new sub-unit to drop too and I never had a day without new Dongkiz content since I stan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@underratedkbops dongkiz is literally feeding us with content every single day but people still refuse to stan for no reason at all like 99% of their stuff is subbed too🙄 just stan dongkiz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I wanted to ask everyone if it was okay if I made those putfit threads again but in a way everybody is comfortable with. So just tell me if it's okay or not and if it's okay tell me what things would make you uncomfy like for example tagging them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay Ari moots remember when I made these Dongkiz outfit threads? Which I deleted bc some people felt uncomfortable and I don't like making people uncomfy even with things I made without bad intentions. But I miss making those threads but I still feel bad about them :((++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom @ksjfiltr @_Lil__Ari_ @zimzalabangtan @wondaevinyls AWWWWWW YOU ARE EVEN MORE PRECIOUS 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕  https://t.co/7ggzqObzVE<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom Same for examole I didn't realize that the outfits thread I made for Dongkiz was making people uncomfortable bc it wasn't my intention at all...but I would've liked to be informed personally before getting blocked and kicked out of the groupchat constantly :((((<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lovelyshinwxn You can find Kebab anywhere I think but Kebab in germany is soo good tbh there is even kebab pizza and it tasted like heaven<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@muumiheikko Yeah every episode my tl is either filled with Munik reacting or Yoseob singing or Munik reacting to Yoseob singing lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@muumiheikko Well he attended it once during the Y.O.U era (if I remember correctly) but now he is a regular guest and is there almost every episode as reactor and always gets put on stage for dances  https://t.co/DelXA7mc2q<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Munik is the one turning around and then running and Jonghyeong is the one walking casually<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wondaeIand Ok same 😭 I see everyone in Dongkiz like that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is how Wondae sees Munik and Jonghyeong  https://t.co/v5BF7eMC4o<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lovelyshinwxn Most kebab sellers in germany are turkish that's why we always get associated with kebab but I don't even mind bc kebab is delicious af<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GozSsi So never?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YYYLS_HIGHLIGHT So Yoseob will never take it off? Kfbsjfnd jk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sokwantha Icjdjf who is your bias?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me connecting the DONGKIZ MVs and comming up with a ridiculous theory and thinking it makes perfect sense  https://t.co/WFQwxVUtQj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't really understand how KOMS works when will they have to take off the masks? Because Yoseob won 2 times and he still didn't take off his mask<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes pls if I ever say something wronf and didn't realize pls educate me through dms I don't want anyone to screenshot my tweets and spread it with their moots when I haven't even realized my mistake<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not only is Munik becoming everyones ult or ult wrecker he is also interacting with our ults or former ults or other biases For me it was Yoseob (ult) and Munik (ult wrecker) on KOMS  He is making everyone be whipped for him<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>GUYS LOOK WHAT I FOUND!!!  https://t.co/7ziaNh6AEe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yk what's beautiful? This many turkish/german kpop stans are now whipped for Dongkiz because I posted their turkish song cover on tiktok  https://t.co/edc2WRf51d<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What if Dongkiz covered Undercover by A.C.E and Wonik did Wowkwan's part?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two types of turks  https://t.co/9JuS0GUDJr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom @nakoyukii Here is their cover In my opinion Jaechan's pronunciations were the best someone who doesn't even know dongkiz commented that Jaechan is fr secretly turkish  https://t.co/OE4Pd3GyE4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom @nakoyukii Yes it's Hele bi gel by Pinhâni. Many turkish people know this song because it's an OST from an old well known turkish show  https://t.co/wH72t0o7Ma<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Twitter deleted the views wtf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait did Twitter delete all the new views I got for this fancam? Like I got like 8k new views and it was at over 40k but now it's gine again???   https://t.co/kRh9avoy3d<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom Yes icjrjgf because his voice in the turkish song cover sounded similar to the original singer  I was laughing so hard because me and @nakoyukii had already talked about how Yoon gives us turkish vibes bc of his strong eyebrows and stuff xjjdjfjd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Smh there's always a 80% chance that every turkish person you meet online either lives in germany or just knows german<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did Dongkiz really just ask Kyoungyoon if he was turkish in his past life?😭😭😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Dongkiz tiktok I uploaded yesterday just started doing big number 3 hours ago jfnsjfnd everyone is shocked by how good their cover is and are now interested in them xksnjdjdjd  https://t.co/7reENYoI3n<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Turkish people are freaking out about Dongkiz help  https://t.co/kuwtre6aw7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xiaoxingyanan Yeah but in the other hand germany teaches way too much and the students are stressed 24/7<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@xiaoxingyanan Ik but I directly think of maths when I see greek letters because in germany I've only seen and used them in maths and physics but I still know they're greek letters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xiaoxingyanan We use them in math and physics too...don't you do that?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@flrtji  https://t.co/pU9eb8hWNO Here is the link for their mv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flrtji Since this is kinda blowing up would you guys mind supporting Dongkiz a little? They are a really underrated group even more underrated than AlphaBat and they had a comeback last month with beautiful, the mv still hasn't reached 100k. this is the teaser   https://t.co/kRh9avoy3d<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me when I am being slept on by the whole kpop community  https://t.co/QSIyH7XvQv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nctandexobiased @flrtji Ikr they are really so underrated like they really should've blown up especially after Tantara that song has been stuck in my head since forever<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cannotrespass I was shocked about how Beast was in "don't know" but then I saw them in "like/know" and realized you probably didn't know the other logo jdsjjfsj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sailormarklee Yes omg It's raining is such a bop I love it so much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I added turkish subs to their turkish song cover and I'm still so shocked about how great their pronunciations are like Wondae, Jonghyeong and Jaechan almost sounded like native speakers and Yoon and Munik were so amazing too just wow  https://t.co/OE4Pd3GyE4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sailormarklee I love them too but I still didn't find the time to learn their names 😭😭😭<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cherrymunik Fjejcjjrf happens<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cherrymunik Jxnekfr I was confused for a second<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J4ECHAN I think as a queer person it's okay to call them lgbtq+ because it really brings comfort to people. And if people aren't okay with their faves being called gay then it's their problem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J4ECHAN Wait did someone say it's not okay?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cherrymunik It's just Jaechan 5th wheeling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay but keep in mind that there is 10 years and 5 months age difference between Yang Yoseob (left) who is 30 and Bae Jinyoung (right) who is 20  https://t.co/RI84GKnHZT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait is this their first vlive to reach 1M?  https://t.co/eRWwzzW8Ky<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hoboulis So me writing this in english and me living in germany and being able to speak german as a turkish person is cultural appropriation? Ups  https://t.co/0q2lgU0P0U<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>UwU yaaay  https://t.co/1ZNaXKpXGA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And they literally said "put your hands together make a wish" ever seen american kids putting their hands together to make a wish before blowing out candles? Y'all just want fanwars that's all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dancing on prayer rugs. They are simply dancing on normal carpets which can be found anywhere. And no they are not mocking our praying. Muslims don't put their hands together while praying. If you actually knew anything about islam you would know that for sure. ++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can non muslims stfu about the NCT MV? The MV does NOT include anything religious nor ca. (I'm muslim). No they aren't in a damn mosque it's just similar architecture but it's clearly not a mosque since it doesn't have religious writings on it. And no they are not ++<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@longgyun Oh heeey I'm in Circle 2 uwu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The most father/son like relationship I've seen in kpop is probably Wonik Munik once called Wondae father and always gets babied by him like constantly 24/7 And Wondae calls him baby, son, cutie, little boy etc., he also said Munik is like a baby and he wants to bite his cheeks  https://t.co/xxwAZSwgWS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cookieekawaii 1. Dongkiz and Highlight 2. SHINee 3. N.Flying 4. A.C.E 5. NCT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was watching the Dongkiz vlogs I haven't watched yet and then I watched that oke vlog where Wondae said "Munik is like a baby. I wish to bite his cheek sometimes. I want to touch it (his cheek). He's so cute" Wondae in love with Munik 24/7<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It probably became Munik in KOMS after he interacted with my ult and reacted to his performances kfjsjfnej<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes I love it jcbdjfndjf<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>An album and my 2nd album hasn't arrived yet :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bb, fever and lupin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blockbuster<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmm hard question probably blockbuster<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Munik. When I watched Fever for the first time I just fell for immediately bc I love idols with cute and energetic personalities he is literally the bias I was always looking for<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shortly before Lupin dropped and yes they are my ults with Highlight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When Blockbuster came out and they were put in this Kpop song chart videos by "kville entertainment" that's when and where I found out about them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok let's go 💕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lovelyshinwxn Beast/Highlight didn't leave cube for nothing. They are clearly way happier in their own company as their own CEO's now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WElSSMANS Yeah I was shocked too when I found out a few months ago fjsnfnd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WElSSMANS Yes they were in turkey during the fever era and a few days ago they were invited by turkey to do an online fanmeeting thing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WAIT YOSEOB IS SEOKHWA'S ROLE MODEL? Literally almost every group has at least one member who has Beast/Highlight members as role models<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He looks like a german rapper 😭😭 Ich betäube meine Sinne  https://t.co/zPnjhS4rzz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kpop happenings talked about the  turkish aegyo Munik did ?? Omg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkingz I WAS SCREAMING IN MY PILLOW WHEN I SAW THIS😭😭😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will add captions to the turkish song cover by Dongkiz in turkish and I will try to translate it in english too it won't be perfect tho   https://t.co/SfUve6UNeg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom Yes omg and when you know the lyrics their pronunciation sojnds almost perfect I was so shocked omg😭😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom Kfjskf i just saw it on my tl and clicked on and didn't realize at first that it was turkish and it didn't sound like english or korean and then boom I remembered that they were doing a turkey online fanmeeting and then I started to understand that they were singing in turkish😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yong_en_cutie Ikr😭😭 they sang it so beautifully and I will never get over the fact that Munik did aegyo in turkish-<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nakoyukii OMG FJNSJFDJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nakoyukii JAA ICH KANNTE DEN SONG VORHER NED VOM NAMEN HER ABER VOM SOUND SCHON Song ist Pinhâni - Hele bi gel<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@boredandsodone I love u even mooore💕💕💕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boredandsodone Yes that would be the best I think. Just wait until you're ready and feel okay. And I hope your headache will go away soon :( rest and eat enough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boredandsodone You're welcome 💕💕💕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boredandsodone I hope she'll respect that you want to distance yourself a little. I can fully understand that it can be really hard. But you gotta do what feels the best for you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mintykyun JFBJDNF<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Iifejifje omg this is so good help<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boredandsodone Yeah it will be better for you to distance yourself from her if she is so ignorant and doesn't understand you she doesn't deserve you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mintykyun It's Welcome to donkytown by Dongkiz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How it started            How it's going  https://t.co/6aDLHyxX29<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkingz No problem 💕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@squishyhw Oh yeah I understand mayhe a cute animal crossing one? Where younjust have to add some cute short clips together to the sound<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@squishyhw Maybe an "inside out edit"? like take a finished one and just cut out the inside out parts and put fitting videos to it    https://t.co/DeQpQosn19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkingz  https://t.co/kBGp34JhlD This one?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vampkooz I think it's okay as long as you are lgbtq+ yourself and say it either ironically or as comfort  I do it as comfort most of the time I really don't see anything bad about it tbh as long as you are lgbtq+ too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zimzalabangtan uwu thank you 💕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me: :( Munik: Me: :)  https://t.co/jx1lUnPk4K<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zimzalabangtan Aww I'm glad you enjoy it vkndicjd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bang*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chan so much too. Like if they ever become close friends I wouldn't know how to react like so much comfort and serotonin uff-<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just started thinking about how it would be like if Banh Chan and Munik became friends. Like they are both extreme sweet hearts and both give comfort to so many people like I know so many people who have them as comfort person. Mine is Munik but I love and appreciate++  https://t.co/N8CKaDepYl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I am so so thankful for kpop and my kpop stan friends. And my english would be a disaster tbh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tbrh without kpop and the friends I found through it I would've been so uneducated in life. I would've never accepted the fact that I am queer even if I knew it already I just never wanted to accept it before finding kpop. And I would still not know a lot of other important stuff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stop putting Jungwon on my tl I'm so whipped and idek who he is exactly but that smile is killing me 😭😭😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fairyyuto Yes right! :( and that's also one of the reasons I'm thankful that I found kpop even if things get messy like today. I always feel the most comfort from kpop and my kpop stan friends like from you rn for example ♡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fairyyuto after meeting online friends through kpop I learned to talk about my problems to others and feel way more comfortable and better about getting help I hope I don't talk too much tho :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fairyyuto Me too :( but I I told them to get therapy they would take it as offensive. I grew up thinking getting help for mental health and therapy is something bad and cringe because of my parents toxic mindset and I'm still afraid of it but ++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fairyyuto Bruh yes I think I saw that on my tl...and got confused bc what they said didn't make sense to me so I just ignored it and kept scrolling incase I misunderstood sth but turns out I was right and they were talking bs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fairyyuto Yeah my parents are really extremely  uneducated in everything tbh and imo they need therapy for themselves too like they are really worrying me most of the time. And because of their own mental problems they can't take care of their own children.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shadowmyg_uwu @Jae_Day6 I think this was better than letter because some people including me have problems with reading handwritten letters. And tweets are limited. But I understand that you are upset about the notes app :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fairyyuto Yes same I've been only trying to give them clues but I just can't talk to them about it bc they just don't understand it. The only time they considered therapy for me was because they had feelings that I am queer and they wanted to "heal me".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fairyyuto Yes I can relate I've been feeling like that for years and years now but my parents would never get me diagnosed. And I really don't want to self diagnose...that's why I always feel clueless about myself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this is not to attack people who feel uncomfortable with notes apps. It's just a questiom bc I wanna know why it is bad :/ Sometimes I feel like people could misunderstand what I write<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is it bad to write apologies on notes apps? I tbh prefer it like that because I have hard times reading handwritten letters sometimes because of different handwritings and stuff. But maybe it's just me so I can't talk over everyone else. And I apologize if I said sth wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So here for the people who unfollowed him. Please remember that you do not have to accept his apology if you don't feel right about it. It's also not my place to accept this but I appreciate the fact that he apologized quickly. Still not my place to accept.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jae_Day6 And jae...pls listen...i'm kinda worried about you :( you seem a little off and stressed out these days. Don't you think it's better to rest and take a break of Twitter? I think it would be good for you to take a break. Just take some time off it will be good for you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jae_Day6 It's not me to accept this but I think I can understand why it took him a while. There were lots of people spamming with hate instead of education. I'm glad he apologized but I will not accept it because it's not my place to do so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cookieekawaii Well tbh I don't care and most i-fans don't either but k-fans could be sensitive about it since drugs/weed are extremely illegal in korea and idols got their careers ruined just for thinking about it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember that you aren't any better if you give people unnecessary anxiety if you force them to unfollow someone who could be their comfort person they are unfortunately really attached to. Give them time to decide on their own<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait who is @/CHOllNS ? I think I saw that username a few times on my tl but then I checked if we follow each other but we don't...I heard that they are problematic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fairyyuto Oh okay thx. I just looked for it and yeah this is not a mosque it's just arabic architecture nothing offensive at all (I'm muslim too). People who say it's offensive either don't know about their own religion or culture or they aren't even muslim or arabic and just want fanwars<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fairyyuto What was that about the tweet above is unavailable :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@classicatz @sanyongace I still see them tho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vimyeo Yes his smile is making my day a lot better 💕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vimyeo Here bebi  https://t.co/a2fHkSalhX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boredandsodone I just hope he will see the helpful comments many people left to educate him and not leave after reading some mean comments hating on irrelevant stuff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boredandsodone Ikr he seems so rude and doesn't understand his mistake rn. I just want to go to him and tell him in person what he did wrong because twitter can be so confusing especially when you are getting thousand of comments every minute<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boredandsodone Rude, ignorant and ableist. It's the same with more people straight up attacking artists for cultural appropriation than people telling them what was wrong about it and explaining things to them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boredandsodone Even more frustrated and cause him to stop reading comments so he won't understand what his mistake was. So instead of spamming with stupid hateful memes and words just clearly tell him what he did wrong. Just saw someone calling him old and a loser instead of saying that he was+<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boredandsodone Yes exactly. He's being stupid and annoying but he wasn't like that before. It's very concering at this point and if more people keep attacking him than eduacting him he won't see the people in the comments eduacting him but mostly the people attacking him which would make him++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boredandsodone Yeah we seriously don't know anything about his life. Like everyone is struggling in life. They could seem really happy but everyone has hard times and no one is perfect. He should just quickly apologize before people get even more mad and then leave for a while<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boredandsodone Yes ikr. He sounded kinda mad and frustrated yesterday. He just really aeemed off to me. And him staying on twitter can make things worse. I'm mad mad but also worried<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boredandsodone Me too. Ugh. I hope he will quickly realize his mistake. It will maybe take a while because we don't know whats going on behind the screen but I really hope he will genuinely apologize and will do anything to gain the trust back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boredandsodone Yes. Exactly my point. I just feel like he's been stressed out and rude because of that. I once made a mistake like too I was insensitive to a friend because I was having a breakdown at that time but I quickly realized my mistake after they told me what I did wrong and apologized<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boredandsodone I'm having a feeling that something bad is going on in his life. I've been having that feeling since yesterday. He just seemed so off to me. This is not to defend him btw. Just my thoughts I had sjnce yesterday. He just should leave social media for a while<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boredandsodone I saw so many famous people do what he did like not admit to their mistakes and act like they are right and not listen to others. He'll regret this so much later. He literally just lost all the respect and trust from his fans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boredandsodone Ikr. I also think that things are going on behind the screen...he seems so different and fed up and rude...maybe something is going on that it's stressing him and he acts that way. He just needs to take time off social media and apologize correctly and think about his actions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boredandsodone Ikr he is so stupid for that. Like I seriously thought he was a cool and open minded person but every person will have something about them that will ruin everything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boredandsodone Yeah ikr I was kinda weirded out by the JYP but like okay I don't care it's his boss he knows him better than I do...but now he is really just being stupid and rude he shoukd shut up and apologize<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jae_Day6 Fuck it he fucked up fr now. I understood the livestream thing because stress can make people fed uo and annoyed and sound rude but now he is just being rude and ignorant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boredandsodone Same...means I' only biasing Dowoon cutie now ✌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boredandsodone I saw the things he recently tweeted just now. I' so annoyed why is he so stupid? Like I can understand if he was just uneducated but he just won't listen either...like damn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nah imma unfollow him for now. I was defending him for the livestream thing bc he just seemed annoyed and fed up like a normal person but the thing about adhd and social anxiety thing he tweeted weird s me out...he is acting so weird what happened? Kinda concerned tbh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jae_Day6 Wait can someone explain what he is trying to say? What is his question?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@POPTHESTALLION How can some people be like: What I will tweet now is completely normal and not weird  Bitch you are weird Just say the kid is cute, don't be weird wtf-<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boredandsodone My sister from another mother💕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melayocampo10 People always say that we shouldn't treat idols like robots but when an idol loses shows that they are humans with feeling we start hating like wtf anger and being annoyed is part of or feelings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boredandsodone It would be better to not do that. But I just can't help it. But I hope you can do it and I hope she apologizes and you can do what feels the best for you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boredandsodone Yeah I can fully relate I know that if I feel uncomfortable that I should distance myself but I smh never do it because I just don't want friendships to end even if they aren't close anymore. I just let them be and if they hurt me I just ignore or forgive them but I know that++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@melayocampo10 Yeah it just felt awk how he was defending JYP but yk we as fans should stay out of that situation since he himself knows JYP better than we do. But I can fully understand that Jae who is a normal human being can indeed become annoyed and fed up and can sound rude sometimes...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boredandsodone Yeah right like do what feels the best for you! Do what feels the most comfortable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boredandsodone I can understand you. Maybe she is trying to swipe the situation away and ignore the bad and awkward energy between you guys. But she should know that that's not the right thing to do, she should apologize correctly and not ignore the situation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boredandsodone Uff I'm so sorry bebi :( I hope she will apologize correctly soon but I'm glad that she regrets what she said and hopefully won't do it again. You deserve a real apology :(<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Every KOMS episode these days is like "on which ult am I supposed to focus now???" for me lmao  https://t.co/C9nmDivJWd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's why I prefer staying in smaller (ex: Dongkiz' fandom) and older/more mature (ex: Highlight's fandom) fandoms where shit like that doesn't happen and won't ever happen<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LoveisLouder @Jae_Day6 @day6official @courtknows @jedfoundation @Represent Y'all overreact with the word "stupid" omg. The comment that person left was stupid. And he was just ged up and annoyed. Y'all try anything to cancel this amazing person. Y'all act like he was yelling and cursing at that person get over it he was just annoyed like a basic human<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Omg ufkgtjfugbg this is so good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jae_Day6 And also don't act like you never called someone "stupid" or sth when you were annoyed by them. He is probably going through stress too and being an idol is stressful. Just demand a normal apology and that's  it. He probably has other hardships going on in his life too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jae_Day6 Don't act like you're always perfect and don't forget that Jae is human a damn human not a robot who can control his emotions 24/7.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jae_Day6 Jae should apologize but I can understand that he was just really fed up with everything and he seemed so annoyed in the live...like don't forget that he is a hard working person and can be annoyed and fed up sometimes. So stop overreacting and bashing him for sth so little<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I still hate myself for liking onisions video but I thoigzt he was a normal youtuber and I found him entertaining but after I heard all thise things he did I got so disgusted and unsubscribed but I liked him and his videos for way too long<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ethereaI_hwa They literally have such similar personalities too like you just can't stop smiling when you look at them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm convinced that Munik (Dongkiz) and Chuu (Loona) are siblings or cousins I don't care if they aren't even related they still are  https://t.co/RQs3xXCJvO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiznom Ja<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Pinkyywon @underratedkbops Yess they are so talented and so precious and all their songs are so amazing and they are also really funny and entertaining<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And then we went to buy dresses for my sister because she will get married soon and we went to 3 different shops and every owner of those shops turned out to be turkish too...I feel like there are more turkish people in germany than germans it's so funny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lmao smh everyone in germany turns out to be turkish We just went to a shop and thought it's russian and the owner looked russian or german too and we were just talking turkish to my mother and german to the owner and she went "are you turkish" in turkish to us lmao so unexpected<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hyojunhees @underratedkbops Here's a small but helpful guide and watching their vlogs on yt is really helpful too because like 95% of them have english subs and have names + age on them also they are really entertaining  https://t.co/j0n9x2pkrl<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@underratedkbops Like pls pls give them a chance they deserve it so much...the fandom is so friendly too I found so many new friends whom I love so much through them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@underratedkbops Exactly I'm so scared for Dongkiz...they are the reason why I'm happy again and I couldn't take a disbandment...it would be exactly like losing my happiness again they are really my comfort group who is there when I feel down.

<|startoftext|>I just wanna let them know that I like them. But AAAA I hate making things awkward 😭😭😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh and the chance that they'll reject me bc of a small age gap is high too :((( but I really like that person AAAAAAAA  And my previous relationships were all in germany but it was still too far away and now my crush lives in a different country- like what do I do???😭😭😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the chance of me randomly breaking up is small bc the smallest amount of affection like texting cute stuff and calling each other cute names is enough for me. That's why they always breal up with me bc I'm either too boring or bc of long distance :((<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>GRRRR I just wanna tell someone that I really like them but I hate rejection and I don't really want a long distance relationship again bc I know that they'll either reject me or break up with me after a while anyways. And I hate making close friendships awkward 😭😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Me thinking about what would happen if Kpop stans never find out about Dongkiz and my boys being slept on forever  https://t.co/fnNhfa2KYo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And most importantly the best and nicest fandom ever I literally love Dongaris so much they are like a family to me I was never this close and comfi with any fandom before.  And we already had 4 sotys this year...I hope we won't get the fifth because babies deserve to rest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The most creative concepts, amazing and always different sounds, incredible and addicting choreographies, 5 rappers, vocalists, dancers, actors, visuals, 1 giant maknae and 4 fake maknaes, a literal family like I've never seen a group who act more like a real family of brothers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most likely reply to your comments on vlive (he replied to 3 of my comments in one live), 5 of the funniest bitches ever, 5 gays, selfies everyday, many radio shows, many covers, the funniest vlogs and random videos on their yt with eng subs, some tiktoks here and there++<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom Yesss like I would cry for weeks and feel so unhappy forever if they ever decide to disband<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tw// disbandment  I would never forgive kpop stans for sleeping on Dongkiz if they ever disband because of being too underrated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The sexual tension between Munik and being the babiest and cutest idol to ever exist<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mistyjeno 5. Munik and Jaechan attending King of masked singer and reacting to the candidates. One of them was my ult bias (Yoseob from Highlight) and Munik is my ult wrecker so yesterday was really emotional and chaotic for me 6. Them doing some dance cover on stage of KOMS like dynamite+<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mistyjeno Yesterday we got: 1. Their final stage for "Beautiful" 2. Their final TikTok for it (they were doing their own TikTok challenge thing every time they finished a stage) 3. Selfies from that days stage outfits 4. A new tiktok from Kyoungyoon singing ++<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@J4ECHAN Awww yess<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HSLOTDRACO 💃🏻  Yes I would dance for him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>because of lack of recognition from kpop stans...it's literally hurting so much to see so much talent and these lovely boys being slept on and mistreated by the whole kpop community fr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like they've been giving me a reason to be happy. They make my everyday so bright and wonderful with just being themselves. And it just hurts to see that everyone is sleeping on these wonderful boys. I would literally die and never stop crying if they disband anytime++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ngl I've been saying that I'm crying over Dongkiz everyday without actually crying actual tears...But after I watched this video and it gave me so much happiness I realized again how fucking important Dongkiz is to me and I fr started crying actual tears  https://t.co/NP669bVNzQ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wat?  https://t.co/vzORw3Wd5G<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I WAS NEVER THIS DISGUSTED BY A NEWS VIDEO BEFORE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TW//Suicide, Yohan Talking about the suicide rate of sk and japan etc. I'm so fucking digusted and I'm crying and shaking. He literally said pointing at Yohan "this kid committed suicide and now look at him again...tell if this is a boy or girl?" I feel like throwing up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TW// suicide, yohan  And then they showed a pic of TST's Yohan. Saying "he committed suicide but the family didn't want to open up so it's not clear if he committed suicide" like wtf and then they say that they ruin the gender standards and make children kill themselves++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/hRr3qCi2ki I just found the most disgusting news video ever. It's from turkey and they are talking about kpop saying "from one terror news to the other let's talk about kpop" and then proceed to say "you can't tell if they are girls or boys" *showing a pic of TOO"++<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@melayocampo10 I knooow but like normally Dongari tweets get like max. 300 likes but like this one has 4k likes and it makes me so happy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cinna_susu Stan Twitter should know that they gay 24/7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>GUYS THE LIKES???? Since when were Dongkiz tweets so big??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ultmill Well it wasn't in the MV but there is a pic in the album that looks pretty gay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom Meanwhile I'm biasing fake Maknaes and dancers Byeongkwan and Munik<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom Me too uff I'm missing out so much smh they really give us so much content<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom Idk but I love this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongk5z Yess remember when they did this goyangi song cover thingie (some of the first videos on their yt channel) and every member was like: acoustic version, chinese version, japanese version, piano version but only Munik was like "Puppy version"  https://t.co/zPTsgECDCG<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dongk5z ME TOO😭😭😭  https://t.co/o2pyT67gjG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongk5z These are truly important<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongk5z They are all baby animals in general xknskfnr but Jonghyeong is mainly a baby bear<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember that THEY did this...I saw so many armchairs claiming it was B*S...like f you not everything is about them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kim_minsunshine Me too...me too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. I don't think big of the US tbh. I mean yeah there is much more than in germany but I'm in no way obsessed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I used to wear hoodies and oversized shirt but nowadays I'm trying to be more stylish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Y'all really stupid sometimes but we are too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Idfk what germans do I think hiking? Drinking? Bruh idk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ehm well Angela Merkel is okay. I don't really know much about politics but i dont think she's as bad as some other people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thinj it's football idrk but no I don't find ut annoying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't imitate accents lmao I don't know how to do that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I never do that but my classmates I think mainly throw houseparties<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I literally only find some Mcdonalds and Burgerking in my hometown and like infinite amounts of kebab chains<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you wanted to start learning spanish instead. But I think it's also based on the parts of the country it's really confusing in germany<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well it's based on the schools you attend. The first school I attended was "gymnasium" and you had to learn german, english and either french or latin...and after the 10th grade you could choose if you wanted to continue learning french or latin or++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, I think it's just normal and i dont have stereotypes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm probably talking shit rn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Weren't good enough so now he is in "hauptschule"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Realschule". For example ny sister graduated from "gymnasium". I went to "gymnasium" for 4 years but gave up because it got too stressful so I willingly dropped to "realschule" and I'm good now. And my brother wasn't allowed to attend gymnasium or realschule because his grades++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the grades drop more like the next lower school is "hauptschule" and you only have 9 grades but very few options for jobs. Your grades in primary school play a big role in choosing the schools because if you have bad grades you aren't allowed to attend "gymnasium" or even++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which is similar or just like "gymnasium" if you want to study in an university. But you can also just aply for a job that doesn't require "Abitur" or studying in universities. And the following lower schools get easier but you also get less chances of good jobs.++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And it's until the 10th grade and it's way easier than "gymnasium" but you don't have as many options for jobs like you have with "gymnasium" you also don't get your "Abitur" which is required for attending universities. That's why you have to go to a new school after graduating+<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can go to the highest level school which we call "gymnasium" idk what it is in english and you basically get more chances for good jobs when you graduate from there it's until 12th or 13th grade. And then you have the lower level we call it "realschule"++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well you start the first grade with like 6 usually and elementary or primary school idfk the difference is until 4th grade and when you graduate from worth grade you can pick the difficulty level of the schools for the upcoming grades. If your grades are good enough++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No we don't we say "good morning" to the teachers and done<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Prom is like the event at school where you dress up and bring someone with you and idfk the difference lmfao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not much but all I hear is y'all stupid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Dongkiz = Kittens leave me alone<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@fairyyuto I didn't even understand what was scary about the mlp one I checked it out yesterday and almost fell asleep...maybe it's because I watched like happy tree friends and don't hug me I'm scared when I was young<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@monxotrbl21 @leoniesgf Yes exactly it looked so weird I felt so bad for minho he also kept going away from him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leoniesgf I mean I saw a video again on my camera roll that shows how idols who genuinely like each other act when something like that happens but if I show it it will look like I'm promoting them with this situation...and I would never want that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@standongkiz We understand you and love you pls don't be sorry for being upset. Let everything out if it helps you💕💕💕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@standongkiz Saaaaame I literally feel the same these days I only feel really comfortable with Dongkiz and  Dongaris and also Highlight and Lights...like best families<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes I just remember how Yoon said that he didn't know how to dance when he entered the company so the members willingly stayed up for nights to teach him dancing and that he's so thankful for them. I just love how precious Dongkiz are they really deserve the whole world  https://t.co/vCyCxZI1ro<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Literally love him so much he is such an inspiration I knew him since I started stanning kpop and I still remember the time we drew butterflies on us for him 💕💕<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@standongkiz ++ and then I just thought "it will be okay if I ever feel too stressed or bad I will have Dongkiz and Dongaris who'll cheer me up again" I'm so grateful to be in this fandom I was never this happy before 💕💕💞💞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@standongkiz This thread just explained perfectly how I feel about our Dongkiz and Dongari family. I'm so happy these days even when bad things happen sometimes because I got Dongkiz and Dongaris who cheer me up everyday. School started again recently and I was worried about getting stressed+<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@standongkiz Idek what my fave clip is tbh<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@leoniesgf I wanna show you an example of what I mean with idols usually laugh together and don't look that much in pain when small accidents like that happen but idk if I should tweet it bc I don't want to sound like I'm promoting any group<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@standongkiz Love you so so much too💕💕💕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@standongkiz Yes but then Dongkiz starts playing randomly (bc my playlist is always on random play) and my mood goes📉📉📉📉📉📉 and suddenly I don't feel sad anymore...it's truly annoying smt udhfyvd But I hope you are fine and can get a good rest and good nights sleep💕💕💕💕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leoniesgf It also looks like he threw his arm up pretty aggressively and fast because Minho looked like he was in a lot of pain and seemed really annoyed...like usually when accidents like that happen in kpop the idols just laugh together bc it wasn't intentionally at all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@standongkiz Thank you💕💕<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Let's take a look inside Dongkiz' groupchat  https://t.co/neXuQUVoZ5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fjshfjr is this behind the scenes of his new drama?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When did this blow up?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom For real<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom Ikr if they are going to hate their child so much and make them go through hell why get a child at the first place?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just realized that when school starts I will have to tell my class what I did in the holidays...what am I supposed to tell them? "I cried over 5 boys the entire holidays and I haven't stopped yet and I also forced s/o to stan them by letting people bark at me. Stan Dongkiz!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aboredmulti Very true both deserved the award just because Dongkiz isn't as big doesn't mean they aren't as good and hardworking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom Dongaris deserve the best fandom award💞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkisses I love dongaris so much I'm so happy to be in this fandom💕💞<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dongkisses Me too jfnejf I just love this fandom it feels like a family<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom Before I was on Dongari twt no one ever payed attention to my tweets or posts but here it's like a family<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom I never felt like making edits until I started stanning Dongkiz...I mean I had a small youtube channel 2 years ago where I posted 1 or 2 edits which were really bad but I never was so into edits like now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The way I see so many Lights on my TL who are parents with kids who are also kpop stans and Lights...this is so precious I still remember how lights babied me for being 15 and acted like parents😭💕 I love this fandom pls<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Literally one of my first kpop boygroups I love KNK so much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>- creating theories - making threads - using omegle - finding actual friends on twt - staying up for teasers and comebacks - watching/waiting for vlives - using fancams - ordering albums And many more things but I can't think of any more rn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dongkiz got me into so many things I never did in 4 years of being a kpop stan, in just a few months: - streaming - voting - editing - having mutuals  - being active on stan twt - following promotions - posting kpop memes - opening fanaccs - being in twt and ig gcs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not at how no one even looked at this pff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom Love u too fjnejfb 💕<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@squishyhw Yeah I guess so I don't know for sure but if it's true I just hope Keeho is okay and everyone apologizes to him...apparently he was 14 when he had a small beef with a 20+ years old and he was never racist and people just blew it out of proportion like usually on twt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pinkhuwee Oh and now I want to draw something too...I've been experiencing art block for months now. Thank you for motivating me to draw again 💕<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>TW// abuse, murder I'm sick of hearing news about turkish people especially children and women being abused (physically or mentally) or killed. She didn't kill herself. Her father murdered her. I pray for her to get justice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tw// death, suicide, abuse This news made me shed so many tears even if I didn't know her. I just felt this so much. I'm also turkish, 15 years old and live with an abusive parent (my mom) and find comfort in idols. I wish I could've helped her. May she rests in peace #Melisa<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That's why I hate stan twt or twt in general. No one knows what the truth is yet everyone is talking until someone who COULD be inmocent gets ruined. I'm not saying he is innocent bc I don't know him. But it's again no wonder that something like this happens on twt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I never really talked about that guy because I KNEW that something like this could be behind it. Since this is stan twt. One person can say sth and everyone would believe it. I don't even know him or stan so I won't defend but I wouldn't be surprised if he is innocent<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kkochiya The*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kkochiya They groups they listed are far from being nugu groups<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kkochiya They way you can tell that they don't even support actual underrated groups themselves Like for example Dongkiz is a nugu group who deserves the world but not groups like ateez or treasure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That fits my mood better<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hrjfleur Fake Maknaes I actually don't look at positions tbh I only look at personality  I mean my ult is a main vocalist, my ult wrecker is main dancer and my 2nd ult wrecker is a drummer bruh   https://t.co/YE6XM0qHUS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Loving this fandom so much rn. We managed to solve such a big issue with so much peace and respect ♡ I know it got really frustrating at some point but we did it! We got our name back  #HighlightLightsFandom #LIGHTxHIGHLIGHT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dohyjuyogido You can steal it but no need to spam anymore 🎉🎊🎉 they released a statement that they'll change it. We won yaaay💕💞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rcpc_dahyunn @dongkiztowncom Ikr after I realized what I said we started laughing so hard it was so funny lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@9pchickenuggets @BenAndBenMusic @BenAndBenLights I thank @BenAndBenMusic for suspending the name. It's still our name so thanks for respecting us<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay now I can peacefully have a meal. Thank you  @BenAndBenMusic so much for respecting us and not using "light" as your fandom name anymore.  https://t.co/SsYLKWbD04<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenAndBenMusic Thank you so much💞💕  https://t.co/QeUQsWjQe8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THANK YOU💞💞 I LOVE YOU NOW💕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The way I was talking with @dongkiztowncom and @rcpc_dahyunn at the same time yesterday and my sister who's literally the biggest Friends fan asked me what I was doing and I said without thinking "I'm chatting with Rachel and Ross"  Istg she looked at me like I lost it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still our fandom name   #HighlightLightsFandom Not #BenAndBenLightsFandom #LIGHTxHIGHLIGHT  @BenAndBenMusic  @BenAndBenLights @Highlight_AUent  https://t.co/yKSihx0Nuo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is it so funny to me seeing people in my TL writing like a whole english sentence and then they continue the same tweet with a completely other language fnnjfnej<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You are allowed to use this pic I made for the fandom💞💡  #HighlightLightsFandom Not #BenAndBenLightsFandom #LIGHTxHIGHLIGHT  @BenAndBenMusic  @BenAndBenLights @Highlight_AUent  https://t.co/23fOm840ts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My other moots probably ask themselves what's going on: Well @BenAndBenMusic stole our (Highlight stans) fandom name "Light/Lights" and keep ignoring us even though their replies are filled with us. Imagine if someone stole the name Dong-Ari or Army or any other fandom name<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if you see this tweet you are obligated to reply   "I'm proud being a Light💡"  don't forget to use the hashtags below  #HighlightLightsFandom 💡 @Highlight_AUEnt #HIGHLIGHT #하이라이트<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love how our fandom keeps being respectful. So @BenAndBenMusic if you want it to stay that way pls CHANGE YOUR FANDOM NAME thanks.  https://t.co/fgS2MBQKLY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. I am a Light. But not your Light.  #HighlightLightsFandom  https://t.co/S8rg58ntsK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our fandom is so nice with this situation but them ignoring us the whole time just makes me really angry bc I'm tired of how our fandom gets hurt all the time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ik I will sound a little toxic today but @BenAndBenMusic literally make me angry at this point. They've been retweeting tweets from their fans but ignore our tweets telling them that "Light" is our fandom name. And their replies are literally filled with us #HighlightLightsFandom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom Like I really wanna see Wondae kicking tyler now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#HighlightLightsFandom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can we like get our fandom name back? @BenAndBenMusic ? The name "Light" is already the name of the fandom of kpop group HIGHLIGHT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Facts. When will kpop stan twt finally realize that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I miss Muniks little mole under his eye I hope we can see it again soon it's too cute  https://t.co/BDMbmznsqj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sftlixi 🤘... Yes   https://t.co/YE6XM0qHUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@squishyhw I mainly tweet about dongkiz and everytime I think a non ari liked my tweet it's just a moot who changed their profile pic to a non dongkiz member bruh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's so cute but did he just spray sth in my eyes and whipped it off my eyes again?    https://t.co/Ulin9d7PVP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The TL is slowly waking up I see   https://t.co/DeQpQosn19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J4ECHAN I can't be sad in silence jfnsjnf I will probably never stop talking about this fjndnfd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@J4ECHAN Did you think I was over it already?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My kpop boy has the best meows and barks no one can tell me otherwise   https://t.co/YE6XM0qHUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I bet Munik smells like baby powder and vanilla  https://t.co/XiGd95J8Hh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cherrymunik Wbk jfjsjf Dongkiz is a whole gay cult<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My TL literally left me alone and went to bed 😭  https://t.co/wDQaYYLi4e<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom Woah the harmonization at the end though talent I call that<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom STOPJFJDNFNNR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom If my future kids ask me what I did in quarantine during a pandemic I will tell them that I was crying over 5 precious boys for literal months<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ikr I'm tired of crying every single day over 5 precious kids who make my life so much happier<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Literally the cutest set of pictures omg wait imma just go cry again for 10th time today bc of Dongkiz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom I could sleep if I wanted to jdbdjnf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom Well it's 5am here but I'm still sobbing so jfndjfnd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waitwhat_gasp2 He's so small compared to him too it's just too precious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry 👉🏻👈🏻 But I can't get it out of my head jfndjfne<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom Rachel just let the tears out I'm doing it too kfndjfne they are too precious to not cry over them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today/yesterday (I haven't slept yet so it's still today for me jfndjfn) was a great day for my twitter acc kfndjf I posted a lot and got more notifications than usual even though I'm still a tiny acc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cherrymunik Idhdjfbej I'm sorry but I can't get over it I'm still thinking about it xjbsjxndnnx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And remember when Wondae immediately started crying when Munik was talking about overcoming hard times and Munik automatically started crying too because Wondae was crying? Yeah hits different and even harder now  https://t.co/zz9qnqAF0F<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I also always asked myself if Wondae babies Munik so much because he's that cute? But now I think it's because Munik is probably the one who stayed with him for the longest time and was the first trainee who didn't leave his side.  https://t.co/0WTQbBoMQ9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still not over this- Like I can't imagine how much Dongkiz means to him. Like the only trainees who stayed and debuted with him and gained his trust and love and didn't hurt him by leaving him again after promising him so much. My love for Dongkiz grows more and more day by day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's literally me rn trying to gain the attention of Yohan stans 😭  https://t.co/2h2O941A8R<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry if my translations are off I don't speak korean fluently at all that's just what I understood lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No wonder Wondae looked so intimidated next to her jdnsjf  https://t.co/tPiNYQFKzn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lmao the difference between Kim Yohan and Seol Wondae while imitating what Jessi had said to them while talking about their experiences with her  Yohan's tiny: "Kim Yohan! Stop acting like a baby!"  Wondae with no chill and even imitating her voice: "Why is this guy like that?"  https://t.co/OQ3Bh96lRD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Literally every Dongari trying to get the attention of other kpop stans by posting Dongkiz content<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom Very much true<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@badassbaek Kfnwkfnke that looks like dancing censored hentai diccs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay I'm waiting   https://t.co/YE6XM0qHUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At the end he was alone again :((((  https://t.co/lgq2v59etm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And ended up being with Jomghyeong. And Wondae kept looking for the members in panic and slowly started losing his mind out of frustration because he was losing everyone  https://t.co/QgtkcMysXe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You could also see the fear in his eyes after Munik fell to the ground. And then Jaechan disappeared after Wondae bumoed into him. We couldn't really see how Yoon disappeared but it looked like he was going somewhere++  https://t.co/Ol8Wy8f1F6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sorry but like: You could see the other members being blindfolded and Wondae walking to the table. Maybe he's keeping them in that building bc he doesn't want to lose them. But then Jonghyeong suddenly disappears infront of him and he panics and runs to look for the members++  https://t.co/9E4ZjphxOP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait...wasn't the main part of my theory about the Beautiful MV that Wondae was afraid of losing the members? It makes even more sense now........<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who covers gg dances like Jonghyeong does?   https://t.co/FQY0TAqwPq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tbh Beast/Highlight they are so funny and Dongkiz is always entertaining like nonstop fun with them<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wondaevinyls Idk what that means but I read it as Pentagon and was so confused<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wondae's and Munik's relationship just became so much more precious now. Imagine how Wondae must've felt when he realized that Munik is not leaving like the other trainees. What if Munik even told him that he won't leave his side?  https://t.co/PdMWIZUztm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yoon with Munik  https://t.co/ajqmXwEzRW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This video makes me even more emotional now   https://t.co/PdMWIZUztm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That just explains why they are so close now and why Wondae babies Munik the most in Dongkiz  https://t.co/PdMWIZUztm<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom Omg I didn't know we started yet but YAY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Song: A Song Of Ash And Smoke by Mot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>End: So he just turned the tables and Wondae is now his and he has the power over him now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>10. At the end Munik looked perfectly fine. The others were gone. And Wondae was sitting in the room where he held Munik and Jaechan captive before but he has a sack on his head and is completely powerless. Munik is in the same room but is free. He can also go out freely.  https://t.co/yWpdx5BgeT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>9. After everyone disappeared, Munik acted like he was disappearing too to make Wondae go completely insane.  https://t.co/no0bIkl5Ny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/8EYKyOjYpu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>8. After Jonghyeong suddenly disappeared infront of his eyes. Wondae started freaking out and looked for him everywhere. Munik now knew what to do but only let the other two disappear infront of Wondae's eyes.  https://t.co/Ptamqen3qp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>7. because Munik wanted to see if he could perform magic on his own like Wondae too, which he could but he didn't know before since Wondae made them feel like they were powerless. After realizing that he made Jonghyeong disappear. He tried the same with Jaechan and Kyoungyoon.  https://t.co/1VrTVALXqG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>6. Meanwhile Wondae was talking to Jonghyeong and Kyoungyoon about what happened and if they knew anything. After he finished talking to Kyoungyoon he started talking to Jonghyeong. But before he could finish. Jonghyeong suddenly disappeared  https://t.co/nuRJbuovWg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>6. While Munik was staying in his room he thought about ways to escape again and to also get rid of the others bc now he knew that he couldn't trust them after Jaechan snitched on him.  https://t.co/hDIs0ese0l<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>5. He then took him to a room without any mirrors to prevent him leaving again. (He didn't know that Munik could escape through mirrors before). He later talked to him about not fleeing again on the dinner table.  https://t.co/XnfySqyKCO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4. Then he waited in the hallway until he felt Muniks presence and then went outside. You can see that Munik walks to Wondae without any hesitation bc he got hypnotized by Wondae to come back. While Munik was coming back he looked at him with anger.  https://t.co/TlWD3XZmEc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3. So he went to the person he knew wasn't strong enough to lie to him. Which is Jaechan. He held him in that room and intimidated him so much that he finally told him how Munik escaped and where he went. He then talked to the mirror to bring Munik back.  https://t.co/4rT0Qq42I5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2. of that building without him. But Munik somehow found a way to escape through mirrors and got outside alone. When Wondae felt that someone was missing he rushed to the window and saw Munik outside. That caused him to get very angry and scared.  https://t.co/aiXuW7L6pr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1. They are all ghosts. Wondae is the strongest one and knows a lot of magic. He's using that to hold the other boys, his bestfriends captive because he is afraid of losing them. The boys don't know how to escape him because he put a spell on them, so they can't get out  https://t.co/U1QK45jQoR<|endoftext|>

And then look them up and either find out that they became super big or just disbanded...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Cinnayoon Ikr bruh only a few people said he "apparently" said something transphobic with no proof at all...bruh if they don't knownit themselves why do they talk?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So if you have any evidence can you just send it to me or else I won't believe it. Like I can't find videos, articles, images anything...all I saw were like 5 tweets saying he apparently said it bruh if you aren't sure why are you talking?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok since I am not that into VAV like I'm just a casual listener but I can't find the Ayno transphobic thing anywhere all I see are a few people saying he "apparently" said something transphobic but I can't find anything else on any app.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@miraticar @Arguss4x4 @csbfag The MV is already out tho:  https://t.co/xMbusFR06U Their fandom is really small but really friendly and peaceful and like a family to me. Literally my favourite fandom. The members are from left to right: Kyoungyoon (20), Jonghyeong (18), Wondae (22), Munik (19) and Jaechan (18)  https://t.co/Z9DVIVYY4k<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@miraticar @Arguss4x4 @csbfag Okay so Dongkiz are as you can see 5 members. They are under Dongyo entertainment and their main concept is retro but they recently tried a more mature and darker concept with their newest comeback "Beautiful" which turned out amazing.

<|startoftext|>@MomoBear1004 Seol Wondae from Dongkiz. I made a small compilation of his singing parts from their title tracks (had to cut out some repeated parts because the video would've been too long for twitter) He is the main rapper AND the lead vocalist  https://t.co/QC9lbG3yFL<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dongkisses I would love to see it omg this is the cutest thing I've heard I wanna get one too but my family is so against tattoos and I'm too young I think but when I grow up I'll for sure get one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkisses You have a Dongree tattoo? 😭 THAT'S SO CUTE and yes show it it will probably make him super happy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like stream what you want but stop freaking harassing people or guilt tripping them if they don't stream Dynamite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I rather stream smaller artists because they can earn from the views. BTS don't need views. They deserve them but they don't need them. SO STOP HARASSING PEOPLE IF THEY'D RATHER STREAM OTHER ARTISTS WHO MAY NEED THE VIEWS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This whole Dynamite streaming thing got too toxic in my opinion. Like stream if you want to but don't force anyone to stream too or don't harass them if they don't want to stream. Some people have better things to do. ++<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I probably would have gotten them to 0.70% but whosfan banned like 3-4 of my accs without a reason<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey Dong-Aris it only took me 12 min. And 8 accs to get Dongkiz 0.7% more on my own they were stuck at 0.60% for hours but now I could vote again and gave them 0.7% in just 12 min. If me alone can do that much imagine how much we could do together  https://t.co/9FniRlhQCI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AND I LOVE THIS PART WHERE THEY COMBINED EVERY DONGKIZ CHOREO TOGETHER AND THEN FINISHED EVERYTHING UP WITH A CUTE CHOREO 😭  https://t.co/WnorAP4RF1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I love how they added a cool dance part to the rap part and then went straight to the normal dance again  https://t.co/KgOQbiVvVh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I watch that Touch My Body Challenge thing with multiple groups and realized how Dongkiz I:Kan was basically the only group with TOO to actually dance the whole time and not be afraid of showing some of their feminine sides with shaking some hips uwu  https://t.co/GlV3rcQJbC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yay Dongkiz really got me into voting. Before this comeback O really didn't understand how voting work. Where and how to vote but now I'm kinda having fun with it jfnsjfnd.

<|startoftext|>“people are allowed to dislike things” WRONG nobody is allowed to dislike Seol Wondae, Lee Kyoungyoon, Jang Munik, Park Jaechan and Kim Jonghyeong from Dongkiz and their cute friend Lex<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>300 likes , 100 rts and 200 replies and i’ll make a Dongkiz version if I find the confidence to do it   https://t.co/fb7nbVyHz6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Since everyone got into retro concepts now thanks to BTS ♡ ...maybe you'll consider checking out Dongkiz' retro style songs they did for almost 2 years   https://t.co/unjr2nWXBK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soobinsmoomin Thank god you are okay 😔💖<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soobinsmoomin Okay I'm so glad that you are fine ♡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soobinsmoomin Pls tell me if you are okay. I'm worried :(  https://t.co/JN75DqM4Vz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soobinsmoomin Oh nuu what's wrong? :( can I help you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I always feel the happiest when someone on here tells me they love me. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I will delete it right away if you tell me. Pls don't worry about making me sad or sth. Yes I will get sad but I will appreciate everything and take actions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I never saw the word nipple as sexual. But I can understand now if you felt weirded out. Some people found it funny and no one complained about it to me so I kept everything. But again if you ever tell me something in my page makes you uncomfortable++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I never thought of those things as bad and bc of that I was @ ing Dongkiz as a way of showing them cute ideas for stage outfits that really seemed cool and innocent. And most people made me feel like they really liked it. Also with my previous username.++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really felt loved and appreciated for the first time on here bc people made me feel like I'm smart for theories and that the clothing for dongkiz thread is cool but I was wrong about the clothing part. I didn't think it would make someone uncomfortable.++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Especially to people I genuinely love like a family. Maybe because my family is toxic and I want to treat everyone I love better than I get treated. And I know that I'm not a perfect person. I do mistakes but I always try to fix those mistakes and apologize as soon as possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because I'm sensitive about things like accidentally hurting people or making them uncomfortable even with posts that seem innocent to most people. All I want to do in my life is making people feel comfortable with me and trust me and like me the way I am.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dongkiz and Dongaris were more family to me in just a few weeks than my actual family in almost 16 years. So ofc I will always care about your comfort. Really don't be shy about talking to me if you feel uncomfortable. Yes I will get emotional and insecure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember I will still love you and appreciate you even if you tell me that I made you uncomfortable in any sort or form. And even if it makes me sad and insecure. All that matters for me is your well being and comfort. I love every Dongari. They are all precious to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But just the fact that I made someone uncomfortable breaks my heart and makes me feel bad. Pls once again always tell me if I make you uncomfortable and why you feel uncomfortable so I can delete it, so no one else will be uncomfortable with me and you can trust me again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tweeting. Pls don't feel uncomfortable :( I'm really not trying to be weird or anything. I'm still a minor so I make mistakes like that. Some people told me I didn't do anything wrong since I meant it in a innocent way and that there was nothing wrong about it++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel so insecure about tweeting anything or liking anything. I feel like even if I think of sth as normal it could make s/o uncomfortable :( And yes I am happy that I got told the reason why people were uncomfortable so I could delete and change it. But now I feel scared of++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soobinsmoomin Thank you thank you so much. And also tell me if I'm ever being annoying or something :(💞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom Don't be sorry and thank you so much. And pls don't worry even if some people don't like me in the gc or made me sad I still will love you guys like a real family. I appreciate your concerns because it makes me grow as a person and learn to respect peoples concerns.💞💞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soobinsmoomin I will ask when I'm back in and apologize in again in the gc. 💞 I don't know what else to do. I always try to be a good person who won't make anyone uncomfortable but still be myself but sometimes I just fail badly and feel so so sorry about it. I'm really trying to be likable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom Ilyt 💞 and I thank you for telling me what was going on. I'm happy to know the truth even if I got really sad and emotionally bc of it I'm really glad to know it and be able to take actions so no one will be uncomfortable anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soobinsmoomin Thank you for understanding. And I will always worry because I now feel like there could be more tweets of mine that make people uncomfortable about me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@squishyhw I made people feel uncomfortable with the clothing thread and my previous username and that's why twitter was kicking me out. And I'm really sorry about it and would never want to make anyone uncomfortable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soobinsmoomin I'm really sorry for it and I never had bad intentions and I want everyone to always tell me if they are under because of me instead of making me get kicked out without me knowing what I did wrong. If they tell me what's wrong I will for sure take actions and delete those tweets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soobinsmoomin  https://t.co/mBi6cT63Fo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dualshik So I deleted everything and feel so bad for making them unintentionally uncomfortable...and I'm still really really sorry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dualshik It was making them uncomfortable...and my previous username "muniks_nipple" made them uncomfy too even though I didn't thing of the word nipple as sth bad like I always call myself after random bodyparts the sound cute to me with my biases names like "chaewonsnose" on paladins...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dualshik I found out why I'm being kicked out of the gc all the time. Some people were uncomfortable with my "things I want dongkiz to wear thread" even though I thought of it as cute and innocent and they made me feel like they like really like it. But now I feel so bad bc I didn't know+<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You should know that I love you guys like my family and won't ever forgive myself for making you uncomfortable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you actually felt uncomfortable. I really don't mean to sexualize anyone with that thread and with my username. I didn't think of cute skirts and crop tops on men who are way older than me and the word "nipple" as bad or sexual. And I'm so so sorry if it came off that way.++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Changed my username. Pls forgive me for my stupid actions and pls just pls always tell me if something I think of as cute is making you uncomfy even uf it's just slightly uncomfortable. I really hate myself for being so stupid. Pls don't make me feel like you like those things++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apology to Dingdongerz: I would like to say that if I made you uncomfortable I'm so sorry. It really wasn't my intention at all and I thoight abiut those things as cyte and innocent and not sexual or bad at all. I'm really sorry for making you uncomfy I deleted everything and++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kim_minsunshine It took me a very long time ifndkfnnd<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It really be like that  https://t.co/A9xvUeTaJR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love them more than I love my family...maybe because my family is toxic and Dongkiz made me happier in a few months than my family in almost 16 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can imagine Dongkiz like:  Munik:                     Wondae: "They were              "How dare they being mean. :("        be mean to                                    my precious                                    bebii?? :(("  https://t.co/iOeuMBXLfW<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@yongsloml My brother is 12 he really used to like kpop especially B.A.P, he still likes them but now he is kinda anti kpop maybe because he us entering puberty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awww I wish my brother was like that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I didn't even know who it was but just guess minghao and it was true finejfndnn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Periodt. They deserved sk much now they did a dark concept and everyone is suddenly complaining about dark concepts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@winwinswrld My bebuu  https://t.co/UGOuJDOfW1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>UwU bebiii  https://t.co/OhitFdTJTo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And tells him to show himself and not to hide in the dark evil mask he is wearing. He can't let him be locked up in his evil self anymore. He wants to save him.  https://t.co/8aQ1VKZulk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Beautiful" on Jaechans shirt.  "Let's meet yourself that you are hiding. Don't be afraid to show yourself. In that dark mask that shallowed you without a sound. I can't keep you locked up there anymore" THIS IS FOR MUNIK FOR SURE. Wondae believes in Muniks good self.++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The dolls behind Jaechan also looked like they were just thrown away. And in the scene with Wondae it looks like he is looking at him saying exactly those words "Look at yourself you are already enough. Before your beauty fades away" and then you can see stickers which say++  https://t.co/F004wynef0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Everything was beautiful before I lost you" (He is really losing everyone like I said) "Look at yourself you are already enough. Before your beauty fades away" I think that was for Jaechan because in my theory he felt like an used doll which wasn't enough.++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Wake up and suddenly everything will appear" (like I said they all were blind and needed to wake up...but because they couldn't they disappeared)  https://t.co/Eq0rf7daQo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"The mask that conceal you"  "We're standing against each other" "I feel like you're forgetting your true self" "Again, it's not you. Don't hide inside it." "Don't look for yourself in the mirror that's already broken" (Munik's mirror was breaking remember?)  https://t.co/3lKVAfNT4T<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I feel like the kyrics will fit to my theory...these lyrics could be from Wondae to the mebers or just Munik...like it totally makes sense with my theory ...I'm shocked rn because I didn't read the kyrics before writing the theory. Feels like Wondae still thinks Munik is good  https://t.co/IzcgGOMeoB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wondaes frustration made Munik the stronger ghost...Wondae isn't strong enough to fight him now...he has to find himself again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because his true self is evil, the others will not become evil, just blind. And he has no intentions to become good. The only one who could have blinded him or make him good was Wondae but Wondae was already frustrated and started losing it after everyone he loved disappeared.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And that's on being ghosts who can't control themselves properly and become lost. Wondae and Munik are the strongest ones but in opposite ways. Jaechan and Kyoungyoon are weak and already gave up. Jonghyeong was just scared and wanted it to end. Munik is the strongest ghost+<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zimzalabangtan I love you tooo💞💞💞💞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BeautifulFromEastToWorld  https://t.co/xMbusFR06U<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awwww 💞💞💞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I couldn't sleep so I made the theory for this comeback (connected to the previous theories) #BeautifulFromEastToWorld  https://t.co/xMbusFR06U Hope you see and like it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now he is outside and alone. Like he lost everyone precious to him. He couldn't save anyone. And is trying to stay sane.  https://t.co/EQqmqHi5ck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now he is lost too after seeing Muniks final form he can't seem to get of that cage and in the other scene when everyone was standing he looked normal but when everyone was sitting he felt dizzy and held his head.  https://t.co/SJQhnMWwa3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But Wondae didn't realize this because he was standing behind him when he unblinded him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe that was Muniks plan after all. He knew Wondae was still awake so he blinded him himself and brought him in there. And woke him up. And make him go crazy by making everyone he loved disappear. And then show himself to him so he can finally be gone too.++  https://t.co/I7A1t7X74Z<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We can now see (probably) Wondaes legs outside infront of evil Munik. Like the two opposites colliding. And this is for Wondae the opposite from a Mirror so he'll start losing himself too now because he is just seeing his opposite self instead of his real self.  https://t.co/UNHsz65u2r<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here Jonghyeong and Kyoungyoon are disappearing together and can't be found by Wondae anymore.  https://t.co/0LTA785ce8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And then he walks away to at least save the others and wants to walk past Jaechan and think he is alright and awake like him but when they bumped into each other and Jaechan disappeared he realized that he was wrong and Jaechan is gone too now.  https://t.co/rfEkoA45p5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But not in the disappearing way. He is still there but his good self can't be brought back anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now he is trying to handle Munik and rushes to him bc he knows that he is the hardest one to bring back because he isn't just blind he is totally evil by now. But when he arrived Munik fell down like he just can't be brought back anymore and he is completely gone now.++  https://t.co/4ymmltieXd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He is still trying to bring Jaechan back here and I think he thinks that it's working for Jaechan now.  https://t.co/OT2eMNZpwq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(The papers say beautiful btw.) Like he is just trying to wake them up. Here you can see him trying to talk to Jonghyeong and Yoon. Like trying to bring them back by talking with them but it doesn't work which is why they disappear.  https://t.co/MP5u7OJeA0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now he is trying to help them. He probably was the one putting munik on this bed because he is like the crazy person chained on a bed. And he probably also put those papers on Jaechan to make him see that he is not just a doll and he is important and beautiful.  https://t.co/99s7UCrVAk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In this part you can see that  Wondae is suddenly sitting alon on the table. The moment he realized  that he is alone. So he looks out the window and probably sees Munik going crazy. So he just knows everything is going down.  https://t.co/5XhBJxuKXn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now to why Jaechan is with dolls. He probably feels like a used doll. Like I said he also had a crush on Yoon's gf but he accepted the fact that it won't work. And then he was used by her to hurt Munik in Y.O.U. Now he just feels like a doll to everyone.  https://t.co/CGFeIwK2Of<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now to why Kyoungyoon is in a wheelchair. Because he was hurt the most. His gf died and one of his bestfriends was the reason. You can also see him infront of white outfits which could resemble wedding dresses since he wanted to propose to her  https://t.co/BwaHoxkkek<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Both Wondae and Munik found themselves in Mirror like things. They just saw themselves. They arr the complete opposite of each other. Wondae is the good one and Munik is the bad one. And Wondae keeps looking at mirrors to not lose himself.  https://t.co/BeSBIsV1Bi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We can see both Wondae and Munik opening their eyes...you can see that Wondaes eyes and hair are mainly light colors and Muniks are red and dark. Because Munik isn't blind like the other 3...he is just too evil that he can't see the loght that's why he is still kind of blind.  https://t.co/vhmCwrrJEM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now, why isn't Jonghyeong concious? He was the most neutral  one here. Well, he blinded himself because he wanted all this craziness to be over.  https://t.co/gRCDnLLcs3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone is blinded except Wondae. And I think the white hair wasn't because of "stress" like I explained before. Now I understand that it's because of him being the conciois one/being at the light side.  https://t.co/Aeq7pvYwOk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>but he keeps himself concious (which is also the album name 自我 = concious) and we can see that this MV is mainly about Wondae.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The furst thing that happens is Munik taking a sack from Wondae's head. Like he kidnapped him. I think it's because Munik was the reason they ended up their after all. Wondae is the sane one here like everyones going crazy++  https://t.co/55AmeLylkg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As you can see the members are now at the abondoned/haunted hospital.  https://t.co/JnATXy7ZeM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OKAY NOW THE MV IS OUT SO I CAN CONTINUE MY THEORY #BeautifulFromEastToWorld  https://t.co/xMbusFR06U<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dongkiztowncom She probably hot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And maybe Munik did the same thing Wondae did with finding himself but his true self wasn't good. He basically turned himself to his evil self. That's why it turned red after he put his hand through the mirror...  https://t.co/1TsE6Idv7Z<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I forgot to talk about the 1st teaser...maybe these scenes are the scenes where Wondae is trying to find his good side again and the scene with the eye is when he woke up  https://t.co/DapOzxBNcO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the hourglass on Jonghyeongs table maybe portrays everyones time running out. On the Lupin one you could see that it's still a bit filled on top but on the beautiful one it's empty on top  https://t.co/7LYe2KJgYA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He was the only one Wondae managed to protect...it also seems like Yoon and Jaechan are clueless and don't really know what's happening  https://t.co/6hxG80Lt7f<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And maybe Jaechan wasn't seen in here bc...   https://t.co/CwuQO3t7I8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wondae knew Munik was the bad guy but he realized that the gf could seriously hurt him or kill him. That's why he was rushing to Munik all scared but to no one else. And Munik was the only one who fell down bc he was the only one she wanted to hurt badly.  https://t.co/rhRXEBk0k5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here you can see Jonghyeong with Yoon but you could never see Wondae with Yoon. Maybe Jonghyeong is already about to give Yoon to the gf. Like they planned.  https://t.co/5xqHnXuVIP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He wanted to tell Jonghyeong that he doesn't want to continue anymore. But Jonghyeong didn't want to understand and disappeared. That's why they are working separately rn. And Jonghyeong was basically taken from Wondae.  https://t.co/5n4fVQZCt9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay now to my theory...if I stick to my theory before I could make sth up. So I said Wondae and Jonghyeong worked together with the gf. But what if Wondae changed his mind. He remembered that he couldn't save her from Munik and now he is putting everyone else in danger too.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@themsatankids Yeah I saw some people calling us clowns and saying we look stupid. Like we didn't even mean it seriously it was just fun to make up stuff. :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@themsatankids A funeral wedding to sent her off to the other side. Like some Hotel Del Luna stuff. There was an episode where a woman had to marry someone in order to be sent to heaven bc she died before she could marry her bf and her parents wanted her to get married udhhkfh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@themsatankids Yeah thank you uwu &lt;3 I neverade theories before it was just fun to think about things like that for once. I hope no one makes fun of it or calls it stupid. Because I really just enjoyed making some theories even if most if didn't make sense. And I don't want to feel bad about it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@themsatankids I hope they are but even if they aren't creating theories was so much fun hdybhjtbbj<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Dongaris with         Dongaris with theories before      theories today  https://t.co/lzZcN4WvRD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pls comment under this if you helped with the theory there are too many messages in the gc and I can't tell who actually creating this theory<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank for reading through the stupidest theory ever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay that was it I guess<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Turned white fast bc ever heard about that your hair is turning gray bc of stress? Anyways and I think Jonghyeong and Wondae will also try to marry Yoon of to her so they can both be happy. So it's still #DongkizWedding time.  https://t.co/IaYXhxIFLB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the reason why Wondae looks crazy too is. 1st the different eye colors are bc he looked at the evidence with only one eye and couldn't see anything so she blinded the eye he didn't use. And the silver hair is bc he felt stressed bc he couldn't save her that's why his hair++  https://t.co/hDDg9Pg7Ia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wondae and Jonghyeong are the only sane ones and worked with her ghost to bring her her past lovers and helped her take revenge on Munik. It wasn't gard for them since she already made them be annoyed by him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Take him but he is scared that's why he is grabbing the bed but he can't take his eyes of her. Jaechan and Yoon are also looking at her bc they liked her too but they don't have anything to be scared of that's why they aren't grabbing anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They are also in a hospital. Which is the place she died in my theory. And the letters in Lupin were probably an invitation from the gf to the boys to come to the hospital. Munik looks the scariest bc he was the killer. And he is standing there bc she wants to++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now we'll get to this teaser image. As you can see Wondae and Jonghyeong are the knly ones who are looking at the camera. Yoon, Jaechan and Munik are looking at somewhere else. Munik is the closest to that thing.  https://t.co/lWJmaaWNcr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I think Wondae kind of speculated that something went wrong and wanted to save her but couldn't find anything. (Him looking into a red hole (just like Muniks room), the 1st aid kit, and the clock (for his time running out)) Jonghyeong was just clueless of anything.++  https://t.co/EEE2JoyuDP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jaechan and Yoon were also mad at each other but they weren't crazy like Munik. Jonghyeong and Wondae were just friends with her but weren't into her.  https://t.co/BqUSqkRkNE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now to why she is so mad mad at Munik. He was responsible for her death. How? Well, I think since him, Yoon and Jaechan liked the same girl he got mad after finding out that she and Yoon was dating and he just went insane and killed her. And tried to hide her body in Nom.  https://t.co/R5vWn0yvn9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Notice how you can see male silhouettes on some of the paintings and then this part where Munik is behind paintings and we can only see his silhouette.  https://t.co/B8nwcIJzwx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(Nvm I can still continue the thread I couldn't add sth new at first so let's continue)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wondae and Jonghyeong both look unbothered and look like they already know stuff.  https://t.co/VDDIm5BYAH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You could also see Munik studying the painting tp see if it means sth. And judging from his expressions he looks scared.  https://t.co/W1uLjtFYH5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yoon also found his letter on a painting which probably portrays his gf. We can also see Jaechan and Munik stuck in that painting. Maybe bc they were lovers of her too?  https://t.co/JFzD08APRq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Munik is the only one who looks kind of scared and confused bc of the letter. And Yoon looks kind of empty. ++  https://t.co/T3XvHoaoxh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's move on to Lupin. After everything that has happened the boys started looking for actual clues on why these things keep happening. You can see that they got a letter.++  https://t.co/5xmqpZl1AX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Munik also seemed hypnotized by her sometimes. And in the end he drops the ball the same way the little girl dropped her doll in Blockbuster.  https://t.co/jqIMCJOia4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also to the member cameos. Notice how you can see both Jonghyeong and Wondae a lot but not Yoon. Like Yoon is just in the back sometimes but Wondae and Jonghyeong almost look like they are watching Munik and Jaechan as if they are working together with the dead gf.  https://t.co/DYW1vivEug<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She probably just wanted to 1. Break his heart and 2. worsen his friendship with Jaechan. Jaechan also seemed angrier than Munik when they realized they like the same girl.  https://t.co/zMI9BN9GSs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now to Y.O.U. Even here bad things kept happening to Munik. He fell in love with a girl (who I think is also Yoon's gf in another form) and saw how his best friend Jaechan liked her too. So they started disliking each other and at the end she went with someone else (Kirin).  https://t.co/aUX1YT8ffw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also in the bb mv...Yoon's ghost detector detected sth which could be the gf. Like detector for bad ghosts or ghosts with grudges. And I think Jonghyeong and Wondae started realizing that sth wasn't right even after they "caught" the ghost and everything calmed down.  https://t.co/OQtNVNwXEC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And looked at her and felt confused and uneasy. Blockbuster was when she started targetting Munik. Because he was the most confused and scared there and on the other MVs he just looked frustrated and scared.  https://t.co/mn8oij8QkJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>his friends. And she is trying to be close to Yoon or touch him.  Let's go back to blockbuster. When she possessed the little girl. She looked really mad and scary. And when Munik gave her the doll she still wasn't happy and then they walked away but Munik stopped+<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone is experiencing paranormal stuff but only Yoon felt it and only Munik got scared. Jonghyeong and Wondae are really unbothered and Jaechan experienced something that wouldn't confuse him. It seems like the gf is trying to scare/hurt Munik and worsen his relationship with+<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wondaes game moving on it's own without him touching the controller or his TV acting stupid. Jonghyeongs lightbulb flickering. Yoon feeling really cold suddenly. And Jaechans tower breaking all of a sudden.  https://t.co/PO2HhPlGo0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The other members experience paranormal things too. They even pointed these out in the MV twice.  https://t.co/JJWJmodACj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And books flying out of the shelve and scaring him. Him not being able to sleep. The others not wanting to read with him because they got annoyed by his "clumsiness" like the dead gf really wants to hurt him smh  https://t.co/oeP0naipLb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And that person is Munik. Cuz he's the only one who experienced bad things happening to him. Like being pushed out of the dance and being confused bc of it. Having to sneeze with scissors in his hands. Sneezing while taking a group picture = making everyonemad at him.  https://t.co/ZkNhUgm2tX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like for example they started being ghostbusters for fun and tried to save a girl from ghosts. But I think the girl is the dead gf and she's just made herself look like a child so they won't notice her. And she's holding a grudge on one of them and keeps following them around.  https://t.co/d1KCy3QMPr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And in All I Need Is U (which was maybe about needing Yoon) at the beginning it showed them with old Yoon on the TV and then Munik turned it off and the members were shown with young Yoon because he finally died too. Now they are all ghosts doing different things.  https://t.co/PbHJk03rmF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And had his gfs pics and their rings with him bc he already knew that his time was coming. ++  https://t.co/Uiyts7PM2x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With that poster. Dongkiz saw it and hepled him dress up and get his hair done and were the only ones watching him. He then sat down looking exhausted and watched the other members performance as if he could suddenly see them again. Maybe he died while sitting in the audience.++  https://t.co/PIy2di7wY4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The members kept following him around as ghosts but he didn't notice them at all. Like they were standing behind him but when the pic was taken they were gone. Maybe he also knew that he was about to die. Which is why he did that last performance and asking people to watch him++  https://t.co/e7pkxX324l<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jaechan and Munik also had a crush on her when they were young (and alive) (Y.O.U). Back to Fever. I think the members lived a normal life and died later and as ghosts they just looked the way they did when Yoon's gf died. Yoon was still alive and an old man.++  https://t.co/NKUrl9s2LH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So my theory rn is: Yoon has a girlfriend he wanted to propose to (Fever). But she died suddenly at a young age which is why old Yoon only has young pictures of her and she was taken to a hospital before she died. (Beautiful teasers)  https://t.co/V0RqgoF74t<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hilightlovebot So 8 replies left<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THIS SHIT JUST GOT SO MUCH CRAZIER<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did I just confuse the whole fandom?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GozSsi Understandable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And in lupin they tried to figure out who did it by looking for clues and in this come back they will maybe find out bc it's getting creepier yk...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe "All I need is u" was for Yoon? The members who are ghosts waited for old Yoon to finally die from old age so he could join them. And what if the other 4 got murdered and needed Yoon to find the murderer/s?++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dongkiznom Why did I think that was from the Lupin MV jfbsjfbsjnfne<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just remembered the time when I was talking to friends on whatsapp and kept changing profile pictures bc i was bored and they kept seeing how I was switching between these 3 pics and they started freaking out and called him scary😭  https://t.co/jDIF32cLsl<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jkvnysus @turlss97 @OH_mes2 He's been popular in korea for a long time now. He's also called the "nations boyfriend". He recently got discharged, released his first solo album and went on multiple variety shows. And yes he is also a very popular actor but he isn't in a new drama rn just in new variety shows<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jdjdbwjdbej this is for sure troublemaker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flirterjm @tonywithbts @allkpop Yeah they went through a lot and deserved so much better<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@turlss97 @OH_mes2 They deleted the comment hahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nephateiaa @tonywithbts @allkpop I just asked for y'all to show some respect because I don't want anyone else to disrespect him just bc you don't know him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flirterjm @tonywithbts @allkpop Yes. Most of the members are still in the military. Hyunseung left in 2016. Junhyung left in 2019 after the burning sun incident (even though he didn't do anything but he just wanted to protect the image of Highlight so he left.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tonywithbts @nephateiaa @allkpop Someone asked me for receipts so I replied with this the person deleted it after some Lights replied to them lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flirterjm @tonywithbts @allkpop And yes they are now CEOs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flirterjm @tonywithbts @allkpop Highlight was Beast. They had to change their name after leaving cube ent. Because Cube claimed their name and they weren't allowed to use it anymore. Later they created their own company Around Us ent. And re-debuted as Highlight with "Plz Don't Be Sad" in 2017.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nephateiaa @tonywithbts @allkpop For example  https://t.co/QskBqlAfs1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Moaye22 @chenlenajemsuh @wintrchiId @OH_mes2 I think obsessed was the wrong word to use but they are still fans and respect Highlight as their seniors and role models. Now listen to them singing On Rainy Days by Beast and don't worry so much about BTS actually being fans of other kpop groups  https://t.co/W4B2b1M8qD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Moaye22 @chenlenajemsuh @wintrchiId @OH_mes2 Pls don't act like BTS never had role models. RM really said that. Many idols have Beast as role models it's nothing new. Pls show some respect. Also armys pls stop saying BTS was the first group to win a Daesang it's literally not true. It was BEAST in 2011 (Artist of the year)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@minty_soo @predebutteumae Same they are still my ults I love them so much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tonywithbts @allkpop Let's praise Doojoon too. I saw some rude armys who disrespected him for being above V and "interrupting" Vminkook :(...like show some respect to him too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So please please show Highlight some respect. When your faves can respect them, why can't you?  https://t.co/MSxZzt04bA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fun fact: When BTS first debuted many people said Jimin looked like Gikwang. There are still some people who say that especially Armys.  https://t.co/42flXiXV2s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ateez' Wooyoung's second role model is Lee Gikwang from Highlight. Y'all keep talking about how his role model is Jimin and how they look alike. Well his other role model is Gikwang and they also look similar.  https://t.co/MkLO4eOJgI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They said they were about to faint bc Highlight was the reason they wanted to become idols uwu), Pentagon, BTS like I said, Lovelyz, Kenta, BTOB Seventeen (Seungkwan literally straight up said "We simply walked on the path you paved for us" to Yoseob's (Highlight) face),++  https://t.co/BxffXHrfMh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And so many other idols have Beast as their role models not only BTS that's why every fandon should respect them. For example: Astro, Victon (when they first met Highlight they were so nervous while waiting for them.++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And to the question who Doojoon is: He is the man sitting in the middle of the first row infront of BTS. Look at RM sitting in the same row as Beast. And I bet he was excited since 1. They still were rookies. 2. Like I said before they were one of their role models back then.  https://t.co/pwz9KpDy2O<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or Jungkook singing On Rainy Days by Beast and the others joining him  https://t.co/maMMsXqnTJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BTS  like Beast/Highlight's songs a lot for example jin randomly singing 12:30 by Beast  https://t.co/0KDbhEYNdk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BTS themselves said they were looking up to Beast when they were trainees  https://t.co/S4cT8IoUWw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes they are CEO's now and have trainees. 3 of their (former) trainees were in Produce x 101 (Jung Jaehun (he was pretty popular), Woo Jewon, Choi Sihyuk).  https://t.co/XC6mK0YCNx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beast was the first boygroup under Cube Entertainment and they became big just after one year and made Cube Ent. A big company together with 4Minute and G. Na. Now they left Cube and created their own label called Around us ent. Together as group under their new name Highlight.  https://t.co/7h6i8ZyKUu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First of all: BTS WASN'T THE FIRST NON BIG 3 GROUP TO WIN A DAESANG IT WAS BEAST BACK IN 2011 FOR ARTIST OF THE YEAR. NOT BTS IN 2016. GET YOUR FACTS TOGETHER.  https://t.co/CrYnaq3TTV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An important thread to why Armys should respect Doojoon and Beast/Highlight and why BTS would spit on Armys if they don't!!!!!!:  https://t.co/rdDW8AMScv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikrokosmosday @BTS_twt Sike no it was Beast back in 2011 I think so pls keep your mouth closed honey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OH_mes2 Look at my man Doojoon making armcgairs mad😏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atzskirt Pls send I'm confused<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Idc if you support Junhyung or not but pls this is not okay at all...so many people will think that the worst person of this incident is Junhyung when he didn't even do anything to any woman.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay but no one even talks about how TheTalko made a video about the burning sun incident last year but literally mistook Highlights Junhyung (who literally did nothing) with JJY (who literally did the worst things you can imagine) and they still didn't delete it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@yoonnella Yeah Beast was the first kpop group I've ever stanned (I was 11 and in ky age and country (germany) most kpop stans started with BTS or Blackpink) well I immediately fell in love with Beast and I'm glad I did they are still my ults uwu<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@casualkoo Notice how no one said Bang Yongguk. Kpop Fans are becoming more and more uncultured<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JEN0MILE And I think it also became a trend to forget about this legendary vocalist called Yang Yoseob (Beast/Highlight) who has always been well known for his amazing vocal skills (Made a compilation of his best parts in 12:30)  https://t.co/dAMdidgpGC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tenIighten Yangyang told him about the Angela Merkel pose<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I hope* not I think bruh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The first one made me cry laugh Y'all ever listened to german rap?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact that the first thing I said when I saw him discharging is "Bebiiiiiii"<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Still can't believe Mero is only 19 dude looks like he is in his 40s even Eun Jiwon who is 42 looks younger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I still wanna know if Disney ever paid SM or Woollim for plagiarizing Sorry Sorry (Super Junior), Dream Girl (SHINee) and especially Come Back Again (Infinite, like they took the whole song and changed lyrics and ruined the rap part) and using it for "Violetta"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is everyone saying they are either "infpng" or "uqbrj" bitch what do you mean?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@D0lKUN I want him to spit on me tho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamescharles Oh I thought you were over 30 already oops my bad maybe if you stanned Dongkiz you would look your age  https://t.co/8SHAsXmnx1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mitsungie Must be hard for him like everytime when he is mad everyone is probably like "aiii gulugulu my bebi you are so cute"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But why is he so cute tho 😭😭 Like he is threatening the person with a spoon and I'm hear crying because of his cuteness<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> https://t.co/FT5SZSODEe For everyone who wants to watch My Youtube Diary aka the webdrama with Munik and Jaechan here is a playlist with every episode with eng subs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cherrymunik @jisunghearts Oh the episodes are with eng subs I made a youtube playlist for them  https://t.co/FT5SZSODEe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cherrymunik @jisunghearts Ikr I just finished that webdrama an hour ago and said "I hope we can see them in other dramas again" and then I got your tweet as notification-<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The way I tweeted this an hour ago and it already aged so well because I just saw in my TL that Jaechan was casted in a new drama jfbsjfbdj now we need actor Munik back too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'VE JUST FINISHED MY YOUTUBE DIARY AND WISHED FOR ANOTHER KDRAMA WITH JAECHAN OR MUNIK OR BOTH AGAIN AND THIS JUST APPEARED IN MY NOTIFICATIONS OMG THE WORLD HEARD ME<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And lmao the way the girl Munik likes is hugging Jaechan (she likes Jaechan btw.) While he is on the floor after she accidentally hit him with a door.  https://t.co/ppsivLxypC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But the ending annoyed me because he still didn't confess to her it makes me angry that their story line wasn't continued properly but it was still a cute and fun webdrama I loved it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just finished watching My Youtube Diary (조아서 구둑중) and I can't stop crying over how cute Munik is and how amazing he is at acting Jaechan too omg I need more dramas with them I love how Munik had hiccups because he liked that one girl A-Seo++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay  https://t.co/7LjERM0TgP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To be able to talk to them irl. So if there is any bi or gay girl who lives in bavaria, germany in Neu-Ulm and would date an ugly 15 years old and isn't much older then dm me and let's get in contact and if I trust you we can meet someday and maybe date<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Out for me because of long distance. And there isn't a single girl in my city who would seriously date me and love me. I also have to meet someone online because I feel more comfortable when I talk through the phone than talking irl. I really have to trust the person++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The way I just want a sweet and funny girlfriend who understands me and would cuddle with me and enjoy her time with me and has nothing against a secret relationship since I am closeted. But on the other hand I want to stay single because no relationship has ever worked++<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wooseokflrt Ithere is a female trans idol called hanbit (I think) she was in mercury And there was a whole girl group called Lady who only had transwomen as members but that was a long long time ago I think maybe thats why it didn't work out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@laachimolala__ I want your money in my english-<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lovelyshinwxn DESERVED<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel like finding Dongkiz and adding them to my ult list wasn't a coincidence. I think they got sent to me so I won't miss Highlight too much while they are serving in the military<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lovelyshinwxn IKR I MEAN BRO MAYBE DONGKIZ IS NUMBER 48 BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO HIGHLIGHT LIKE THEY ARE SO WELL KNOWN IN KOREA I WONDER IF BEAST IS RANKED HIGHER<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lovelyshinwxn THEY ARE ALSO SO CLOSE TO HIGHLIGHT AND SHINHWA IBSFJJFKS WHAT HAPPENED<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But why are Highlight not more popular? They were pretty popular after their redebut I mean Plz Don't Be Sad got like 5 wins or more...I hope Yongs scandal didn't affect their popularity too much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DONGKIZ MORE POPULAR THAN MCND??? JFGBDHFB I-<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bro I hope @dongkiz_dy Is educated in different cultures because I don't want to see any ca on Dongkiz ever. And that they'll stay the unproblematic group they are rn forever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yong Junhyung<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zimzalabangtan @dongaristruggle Oooooh okay now I know who is behind the acc lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@areyves Why does it look like they have a conversation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just realized how extremely small this fandom is. I was looking through @dongaristruggle and 99% of the struggle tweets are from my moots. Like I recognize them all from the pfp's or dn's and I've only been on Dong-ari twt for like 2 weeks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's such a beautiful message. I am crying :( 💛<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I forgot to say that my name is Ren...It's not my real name but I like this name a lot and I feel very comfortable with it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want to learn korean so I can maybe get to interact with Yoseob on his story<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For sure they were about to get reallt popular but smh the company won't give them any comebacks anymore bro I have the feeling that Sunset is already years old<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lightinluv I hope we can see all of them debuting in successful groups I will support them anyways<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lightinluv Ah thank you okay I'm glad that he is still a trainee but sadly not under AU anymore I hope he is healthy and happy. ♡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BEX0NCE 8 because small and less toxic I mean DongAris are basically just 30 nice people on Twitter Lights are nice as long as they don't cry/fight about OT4 or OT5 N.Fias are angels most of the time  https://t.co/EXQhBQ4E0z<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lightinluv All of them? That's sad I would like to know the reason and the sorce tho I hope they were treated right they are so talented<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Taelovz A.C.E<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks you now I can't stop thinking about it too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wanna know more about Around Us trainees bro we literally get no updates on Sihyuk, Jewon and Jaehun Some Idek if they are still under AU ent.  Sihyuk is active on IG sometimes but I have no idea if he is still under AU I also wanted to see them debut together<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@purple_dawn_jh @rentyongf Oh and I apologize if I sounded rude. :( I just wanted to clear up things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>what was your fave title track by (bg edition) :   Dongkiz: Blockbuster/Lupin/Fever  Ikon: Dumb and Dumber Stray Kids: God's Menu EXO: Sweet Lies NCT Dream: 119/Drippin'  comment for 5 bgs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@purple_dawn_jh Idc if you deleted it because of me or someone else. I'm glad just glad that you deleted it. Bc there is no reason for you to bring up TY just to defend JH when both of them are innocent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ncityaldinord @ludanshin True I forgot about the song gonna download it now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@purple_dawn_jh @rentyongf That was for the scamming incident years ago he was idk 13 probably not for bullying. And he apologized for things he didn't do because he just wanted peace. Ik that Jun is proven innocent I never said anything else but you just can't bring Tae in this when he is clearly innocent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@purple_dawn_jh Taeyong even refused to take legal actions since his classmates were involved and he didn't want to ruin their future. If you want people to believe in Junhyungs innocence then don't hate on other idols without informing yourself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@purple_dawn_jh I've been ulting Highlight for 4 years now. But you guys keep saying things like "get your facts straight don't spread information but ypu just literally did that with Taeyong". Taeyong never bullied anyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@purple_dawn_jh Bro Taeyong is not a bully. It was fucking confirmed that the person who said that he is a bully lied they even admitted it themselves and the prson who was allegedly the victim said that it was all a lie by one of their classmates and that th alleged didn't know anything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I only noticed that on the show today jjncinnak  A chance that he is a member of the polished man campaign like Hongjoong and some other male idols are? Like they paint only one finger to show support for the children who die due to voilence every 5 minutes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Will I ever be on @dongaristruggle ? I have to struggle more I guess<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking at the Y.O.U comments I realized how many Azerbaijani fans Dongkiz has...feels like Wihi with turkish fans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hyekangbi Und ich dkz 👁👄👁 like deren normale stages sind schon geil genug was würde passieren wenn sie in kingdom wären jjfjsjfnzjsn<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I AM FUCKING CRYING PLS  https://t.co/gr6Exs8abW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every group is hardworking and good in their own ways. Why do people keep starting fanwars over the stupidest reasons?? Every other group is as important and as hardworking as BTS. Y'all just can't accept that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To have meaningful and inspiring lyrics about self-love and stuff. Y'all just too ignorant and think everything is about BTS and if someone disagrees y'all get mad af for no fucking reason. Know you place as fan and don't drag others for the simplest things. ++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember that BTS wasn't the first group of all time and there were so many other groups from which BTS took inspiration, which isn't bad at all. No one can create something completely new. And no BTS wasn't the first group to have storylines in their mvs or++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because you can just say "*any other group* paved the way" and you will get dragged by the whole fandom who thinks their faves are more important than any other group. Or who thinks that everything another group does is copied from BTS. I don't see any other fandom doing that.++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But staying in a mostly toxic fandom is just really bad for mental health so I'd rather stay in a fandom thats mostly peaceful and won't bully others for liking other groups more. And don't try to tell me that Armys don't do that.++<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@b2utyforever03 @HLofMyLife Also you don't have to be too sad. Jun will still be earning lots of money through his produced songs. And even if the boys will never talk about him again we still can be sure that they secretly will stay in contact and hang out together. They are a family after all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@b2utyforever03 @HLofMyLife Also we really can't expect all of them to risk their careers of 10 years for a friendship which they still can and most likely will keep behind the scenes. I don't think they would cut contacts with Jun because of this stupid scandal. They are too close for that to happen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@b2utyforever03 @HLofMyLife I'm pretty sure the boys are hurting even more than us. Just out yourself in their position. And I'm sure they still are in contact with Jun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What if Yoseob didn't say "OT4" with these 4 hearts but he put a heart for each member he loves. Start reading between the lines this clearly says "Soon I will be be with -&gt; Junhyung💙 Dongwoon💛 Gikwang💜 and Doojoon💚" but he didn't try to make it too obvious.  https://t.co/CecT3AnWhI<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@zimzalabangtan Even SK smelled the dkz world domination<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What if SM felt the "Dongkiz world domination" energy and were so scared that they decided to release Monster at the same as Y.O.U<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do these things always happen to me? But tbh it looks pretty cool  https://t.co/LL6PhsGAkY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HAHAHAH nooo bebi jdnsndn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zimzalabangtan I already feel like a big ari acc with 5 likes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sngwooflrt This breaks my heart and I'm so sorry for you :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zimzalabangtan Yeah Ikr I was referring to girls who did the thing because they wanted to. In germany it's so common yk. But I can fully understand when girls become pregnant when they get taken advantage of. That's why abortion should be legal everywhere. I can't imagine their pain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zimzalabangtan Same :( It must be really hard for them- But how do theu even do that I can't even talk to people and they are getting pregnant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did I just learn BZ-Boys in 2 minutes by just scrolling through their Twitter. They are so easy to learn I-<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The way I forgot that I actually know this song. It's a bop btw. I'm gonna stan them today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imagine if we got Dongkiz trending when the MV drops- HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH  https://t.co/juS3A5XKdK HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHILOVEMUNIKAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IDOLisBTS Victon and I'm currently learning ONF and Nature<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Won't bring him back. You don't realize how much more the members themselves are hurting over this. But to avoid criticism they have to stay silent about Junhyung. And begging them or forcing them to talk about him even mentioning him will probably hurt them alot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Junhyungs decision to leave. Maybe only his decision. And I am sure that he doesn't want the members to talk about him. As we know the members they care more about the group than themselves. We all want Junhyung back. But hating on the members. Leaving the fandom etc.++<|endoftext|>
