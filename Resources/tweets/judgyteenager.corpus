<|startoftext|>@spatel16333289 @Charles28973069 that cops do not deal well with mental issues and it usually leads to racist actions or injustices within primarily black communities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spatel16333289 @Charles28973069 now onto defunding the police, when we say defund the police, we mean that there is already too much unnecessary money in the police force. but defunding the money and using it to open various mental health platforms, people can call there for various issues. it is evident now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spatel16333289 @Charles28973069 your taking one incident of black and black crime and using it as a validation that black people are violent and harmful, but would you say the same about the white school shooters (most of em) who are labelled as ‚Äòtroubled‚Äô or ‚Äòmentally unwell‚Äô?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spatel16333289 @Charles28973069 you need to understand that when we say ‚ÄòBlack Lives Matter‚Äô we are NOT saying other lives don‚Äôt matter, only that black lives have mattered less in society due to systemic and systematic racism which is foundated and institutionalised by the police force who derived from slavery<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Charles28973069 @spatel16333289 you guys complain so much about blm vandalising and when the all lives matter people do it it‚Äôs american patriarchy. be ashamed of yourselves americans, this is not okay. black lives matter!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@spatel16333289 @JoeBiden 1. antifa is a political ideology against fascism and is not a political group to be labeled ‚Äòterritorists‚Äô, 2.

<|startoftext|>@william54233350 @4TimesAYear @MrDavidJohns thats because 12.6% of the population is african american..and none of those white people killed by cops has ever been killed due to their skin colour. thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OSRSKID @GarfieldBeans @MrDavidJohns those statements are untrue. but even if the crime rates were higher, black communities are more militarised due to racist insinuations, so more crimes will be seen, but evidently white community‚Äôs are less militarised and white people are more likely to get away with crime.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@william54233350 @MrDavidJohns maybe if black communities weren‚Äôt over militarised compared to white communities you would understand that the crime rates are close to the same. food for a rational thought in ur mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarfieldBeans @MrDavidJohns Getting killed by police is a leading cause of death for young black men in America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarfieldBeans @MrDavidJohns instead of percentages, by the way, that‚Äôs so idiotic of you to invalidate their experiences, and wheres that number from?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarfieldBeans @MrDavidJohns About 1 in 1,000 black men and boys in America can expect to die at the hands of police, according to a new analysis of deaths involving law enforcement officers. That makes them 2.5 times more likely than white men and boys to die during an encounter with cops.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tonyr70843765 @NoMuertoTodovia @yngtini also, assaulting people during arrests, killing innocent black people due to ‚Äòjustice‚Äô and many many more things that escape the radar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tonyr70843765 @NoMuertoTodovia @yngtini Bribing or lobbying legislators to pass or maintain laws that give police excessive power or status. Police officers often share what is known in the United States as a "blue code of silence", which means that they do not turn each other in for misconduct.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tonyr70843765 @NoMuertoTodovia @yngtini if you sign up to be a police officer you swear to enforce all laws, even ones that are unjust and initiate violence in peaceful people. so yes, all cops are bad, there are good people, and there are cops who are otherwise good people, but there are no GOOD cops.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tonyr70843765 @NoMuertoTodovia @yngtini ACAB doesn‚Äôt mean every individual cop is bad, but they al work for a corrupt racist system which allows them to murder innocent black people and minorities and escaped unharmed. so yeah, they saved your life, that‚Äôs great, but the system they work in is NOT okay.

<|startoftext|>@kissesohara @PhiPhiOhara also, i stated that i hated her in all stars, not as a person. quite frankly i‚Äôm happy with his response to sherri pie. the way that he was talking on all stars was a conflicting issue for me. period.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@VidCon and y‚Äôall couldn‚Äôt get any of these guys for vidcon australia ü§°<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@74Barbara @smh @JordsBaker then it‚Äôs not your place to talk about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Maretothepoint @smh it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs determined on your skill level in your desired subjects! stop shitting on people for choosing things they love and PROCEEDING to be great at it just because you are selfish and jealous of their success<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@74Barbara @smh @JordsBaker that‚Äôs because it‚Äôs a score based on your skills on your desired subjects, not how hard the course is. you mad cause u didn‚Äôt get 95? :/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hotgirlshitx @ManUnitedFanZo1 @danielle_twts but also starting majorworks early was so so important, and also just priorities including mental health are much more important than that extra study at 2am. take care, work hard but know you are still human, and it‚Äôs ok to feel down sometimes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hotgirlshitx @ManUnitedFanZo1 @danielle_twts oh awesome! what did you do for your drama IP? what other subjects did you do as well and what do u like and dislike?   my biggest tip for HSC: talk to people. make sure you don‚Äôt lock yourself in a room for hours on end reading endless notes out of a book, your not in a jail-<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hotgirlshitx @ManUnitedFanZo1 @danielle_twts thank you so much!  i wish you the best of luck on all of your upcoming HSC exams. it‚Äôs still stressful regardless of the situation. i did:  Drama Visual arts Society &amp; culture maths standard 2 english advanced + extension<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hotgirlshitx @ManUnitedFanZo1 @danielle_twts i recieved an atar of 99 and i am getting notes from people who left high school with 50&gt;, it doesn‚Äôt define things.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@itsnickhorton YES<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey all Shane Dawson haters! I have one thing and only one thing to say..  Unfollow and block me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@haylor I don‚Äôt really get what your saying but are you against me or agreeing haha?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahbabee5 Logan Paul filmed a dead body and even Dylan O‚ÄôBrien told him to fuck off and he didn‚Äôt die unfortunately but I see your point. This can get blown even more out of proportion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahbabee5 It won‚Äôt ruin his career<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@townetaylor Please don‚Äôt think that this Shane drama is some kinda entertainment, he got affected by this. Btw what‚Äôs the close couture thing??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@randommexican Girl know all of your favs before you accuse someone, he isn‚Äôt a pedophile, he used dark humour, and since you don‚Äôt really know how Shane is I‚Äôm gonna guess your not a fan your here for attention. Sorry but not sorry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Onision Your trying to cancel Shane Dawson when your career was a flop after 2015? Boy get out of here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You think Shane Dawson is a pedophile? The same one that tried finding Hollywood pedos to stop them? The guy who helped a young singer make a career? The one that always makes us laugh when I‚Äôm upset? Shane Dawson is not a pedophile. #standbyshane<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shane Dawson is one of the most influencial people on YouTube by always creating content to make people smile and laugh, he is not a pedophile, and real fans know this, Logan Paul films a dead body and gets to pass go and get 200 bucks without losing a fucking sub? #standbyshane<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shane Dawson is NOT A FUCKING PEDOPHILE!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@helenadonahue @elijahdaniel @superdeluxe For influencers can it be youtubers ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cathy_camera Oh I‚Äôm so sorry what a close call.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>May I just say something, I announce things on Twitter that pop into my mind for my 50 followers too see never expecting to get 10k likes lmao. Sorry if I offended anyone but we all have to agree what happened was messed up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PlushBear1 @it_cecee Lol seriously I wasn‚Äôt expecting 10 people to see it other than 10k<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Charfair I know that laughter can be used as a defence mechanism, what‚Äôs worse is the fact that he said ‚Äúwhat you‚Äôve never stood next to a dead guy‚Äù and smiled, plus filming the body was rude anyways.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mark16lott Oh shit lemme get that deal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kalenterikarju What I said is not okay or Logan Paul?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__arinanaaa I was in Hawaii and didn‚Äôt know but I don‚Äôt support that either girl x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mymaingotreport Hahahha I‚Äôm mad :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kjmtaeyeon @AndreaRussett The support is so cute<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zed_cull Further explanation?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flightcontrols2 1. Learn to have proper grammar, most likely you are the little one. 2. I‚Äôm a guy, thank you though, girls are highly respected and loved. 3. Mind your business?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EatRead1DRepeat Agreed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GraceVe04431165 @floralsophia_x You gettin no likes girl sit down<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cocefi Him saying suicide is not the right answer is somewhat respectful not educational, but the things he did were very offensive not only to the victims family but all of japan and the world. Everyone is entitled to an opinion though, I respect yours<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LexGoyle Lex lex lex, everyone has a right for an opinion! And I respect yours but.... liberal cuck? Is that necessary? Politics have nothing to do with this, this person filmed a dead person hanging in a forest and mad plenty of people mad so before you attack me sit down and fact check<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LexGoyle I was clearly stating my point and many agree, so you should sit down with your political standpoint and realise that your not gonna win against the majority. What he did was wrong, and can‚Äôt be fixed. And I will and am mad, and your mad about me being mad is pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BerleyB87 Oath<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RawStory It‚Äôs what he deserves. What he did was very offensive not only for japan but for the whole world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Logan Paul gets to keep his channel after this controversy I‚Äôm gonna get real mad. YOUTUBERS WHO POST GOOD CLEAN CONTENT GET DEMONETISED BUT LOGAN PAUL SHOWS A DEAD BODY AND IT TAKES OVER 12 HOURS TO DELETE. SUPRISE YOUTUBE, 6 MILLION KIDS SAW IT #loganpaul<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HK9Gaming People are reporting on the situation because it affected others lives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@starlightsouI He went into a suicide forest in japan and saw a Japanese person hanging to a tree and filmed the body and having a close up of his purple arms. He then continued to make jokes and somewhat laugh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HK9Gaming You wanna know what he did before you make a joke like this? He went to japan, went into a suicide forest and found a dead body and filmed the body to 6 million kids around the world. In his video him and his friends all seemed to somewhat laugh about the situation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouTube Delete Logan Paul‚Äôs channel and jakes  Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Isabelle_12125 @GeorgesSuitcase @elin_lois_17 @OliWhiteTV Logan Paul has made many more mistakes like starting an internet war with his own brother and being a lit shithead over the whole YouTube platform. You need to grow up and realise that he is nothing but a YouTuber who uses horrible things for views<|endoftext|>
