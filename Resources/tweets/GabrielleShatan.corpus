<|startoftext|>@DanCrenshawTX BS and gaslighting alert. The left is committed to non violent protest. The rise of radical white supremacy has lead to a major increase in violent protests. Period<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump Let’s see Heather Heyer was killed by who?  A White supremacist. What did Kyle Rittenhouse do? Murder people. What was he? A right wing white supremacist radical. You protest too much. Lies and spin and gaslighting. Please go to Parler.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sondrad1212 No way!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Binders does not equal actual evidence!! More props to look like you have a case. Well 5.3 million votes more for Biden won’t go away no matter how many binders you have. @PressSec @realDonaldTrump sharpie edits won’t work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like #BidenHarris are on their way to an electoral college landslide!! And a popular vote landslide with 5.3 million votes more than #trump got. And his lead is growing. #TrumpIsLosing #PresidentElectBiden  https://t.co/oj8jykbBxi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amy_Siskind Ew<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @senatemajldr why are you doing absolutely nothing to help Americans with the impact of COVID? You prefer to spin lies about the election and attack the ACA! What are your priorities?? #CorruptGOP #BidenWasElected<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WH is a hotspot!!! Still. Again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trishanderton @GOP Truth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We need #BidenHarris now. The @GOP has no idea how to manage this health crisis! They have no idea how to govern!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So we no longer have DOJ or a State Department. When will the #CorruptGOP wake up and out country first?!?! @senatemajldr you are responsible for the demise of our country!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jabbbc1 @arsanchez1996 @Boricua_En_Maui @BrianKempGA The solution is to stop spurious lawsuits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edwardglenled @kdgLOVES @Boricua_En_Maui @BrianKempGA Freedoms? Really? Our freedoms have been whittled away under trump. Freedom to walk the streets safely, to have control over our own bodies, to love who we love, to be free from want, to be free from hate! What freedoms are you concerned about? Gun ownership? Bye<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edwardglenled @kdgLOVES @Boricua_En_Maui @BrianKempGA 5 million more votes for Biden/Harris. They won. Fair and square. Enough Electoral college votes with a big enough margin in enough states. It is a done deal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arsanchez1996 @Boricua_En_Maui @BrianKempGA The problem is that the narrative is undermining people’s faith in the election and is delaying the next steps. This leaves us vulnerable in terms of national security and deepens the divisions. It is dangerous and foolish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrianKempGA What are you implying ? Of course. It goes without saying. This narrative is a @GOP attempt to create yet another false narrative. #GaslightingAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoriBush Yes!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The @GOP has proven yet again that they do not care about the constitution unless it serves them. They do not care about democracy unless they can twist towards their agenda. 4.4 million MORE people voted for Biden!! #BidenTransition #bidenharriswon<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@haterdomuca @MarkDice Isn’t that what trump does every single day?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remember that #trump is a master of projection. When he says the election is being stolen he is projecting his intention which is to get a 2nd term no matter how. His behavior now is exactly why he is vilified. Classic Authoritarianism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Typical #trump #Gaslighting about the #2020Election   Voter fraud is not rampant. The election was not stolen. More Americans voted for Biden. Period. #MoveOn #BidenHarris2020 Biden has the votes!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If the #democats are stealing the election than why didn’t we do better?  We lost Senate races that seemed in the bag, we lost house seats, we lost states that looked good for #Biden early on. Makes no sense and is a dangerous lie. #TrumpIsLosing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRickyDavila I agree!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheRickyDavila Watching people oppose democracy is terrifying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#trump is spreading rumors with no evidence. What happened in Ohio favored trump after the votes were counted so now the opposite is happening in other states. When all the votes are counted then we have results. #TrumpIsCompromised #TrumpIsLosing #TrumpLies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you seriously believe #trump when he says the @GOP is the party of small donors!! The party of diversity??? Lies lies lies @realDonaldTrump does not know how elections work. You count votes and then you have results. Period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump People are dying. Dying. Life is upside down. The economy is in tatters. Covid Covid Covid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So trump votes protest for counting all the votes in one state, recounting in another and stopping the court in yet another. What they want is to count only in a way that seals the deal for trump. Civic education in America is failing. #democracy #CountEveryVote in every state<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let me get this straight: Trump wants a recount in states he lost but does not want all votes counted in competitive races in PA and NC! It is an election. Votes need to be counted!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I do not care if #AmyConeyBarrett has a large family! I do care that this is yet another stolen court seat. This nomination and hearing is a sham. It is a violation and #AmyConeyBarrett has refused to answer any question of substance.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#AmyComeyBarrett Ben #sasse talks of civics when he is from a party that suppresses the vote, that steals a court seat, that turns public safety into a partisan fight! Give me a break @Bensasse2020 do you not know @senatemajldr who changes every rule to suit him?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NikkiHaley Why are you talking about packing the court when it is clear that the GOP is all about packing the court and stealing SCOTUS seats with improper procedure and hypocrisy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 Gaslighting and hyperbolic misinformation. Voter fraud is not a major problem. Vote suppression, however, is rampant. #VoteBidenHarrisToSaveAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliekirk11 Trending well with whom??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmoneyResists Lack of breaking news<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So there is not enough time to pass a #COVID__19 relief bill but there is enough time to appoint a Supreme Court justice for a lifetime seat???? @senatemajldr how much damage to our country will satisfy you? How many deaths are worth it to you? #MoscowMitch #VoteBidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excited to watch #Biden #TownHall next week. No need to give air time to lying, interrupting, rude and ignorant trump. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #VoteBidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BrandonStraka @TheDemocrats This headline is misleading. Listen to the press conference<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillOReilly This is actually a smart idea. We need to make the 25th amendment actionable. Trump is a great example of why we need this. What are you afraid of?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You clearly did not listen to a word she said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So glad we will have a debate without #trump. He ruined the last one. Let’s hear from #Biden for some #sanity and #compassion and #plans to address the very real problems we are facing. #VoteBidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Now @VP thinks he is the moderator too? He picks questions, asks @KamalaHarris questions and then draws his own false conclusions. #VoteBidenHarris2020 #VPDebate #VPdebates2020 his lack of respect is equal to that of @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@VP shows zero respect for the debate as he talks over #KamalaHarris and picks and chooses which questions he wants to answer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandyRainbow Absolutely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is @VP avoiding the questions? Why is he choosing his own questions. All he can say is green new deal and tax scam. And smirk. Smirk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does @VP understand the science behind climate change? I think not. #LiesLiesLies #VoteBidenHarris2020 #VPDebate #science<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #ACA is very popular with the American people. People like health care and want coverage for their young adult children and for pre-existing conditions. #VPDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So pence keeps lying and lying. Tarifs hurt farmers! The tax scam hurts the middle class. COVID is killing Americans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think @VP has forgotten 2008 when a Republican administration crashed the economy which @BarackObama and @JoeBiden brought back from the brink<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KaivanShroff Not watching CNN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So where are @realDonaldTrump tax returns. @VP you continue to lie and spin. What national plan has there been to address the pandemic? The house passed a relief bill months ago! My Loved ones are hurting because of your inaction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandPaul Really!!! Wow. And Vp pence is trying to make us believe trump cares about people dying from the virus when he is actively spreading the disease. Come on. Closing travel from China was one thing that Trump did and he did nothing else. Nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pence is not answering the question about why so many people have died! 210,000!!!!! #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SunandSipCups @DrTomFrieden I thought we were the richest country ? If we are so great why can’t we take care of our citizens and actually address the virus? 210,000 people have died!! Died. Have you lost anyone?!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BHRCSD @StephenKing Exactly. But why reduce drop boxes? Why is that ok?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BHRCSD @StephenKing Masks are essential but still being inside is higher risk and there is no reason to create roadblocks to voting. That is what it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BHRCSD @StephenKing Different issue. Drop boxes are for folks who do not want to go to the polls. I seem to recall there is a pandemic which makes going to the polls risky for many people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BHRCSD @StephenKing But some of the counties are the size of small states with one drop box? Trump has interfered with the USPS so drop boxes are a good option but only 1?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RepAndyBiggsAZ Please tell me why we should listen to a radiologist’s advice about a highly infectious disease? Do you go to a dentist when you have a stomach ache? Come on. How stupid do you think we are?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jhaskinscabrera @GovRonDeSantis It is also a nation that underfunds schools, that has no national healthcare and has not gotten the virus under control.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Do you realize he is NOT qualified? He is a radiologist. He is being given this position for one reason only. Because he will pander to trump. #VoteBidenHarrisToSaveAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovRonDeSantis Why are you thanking a radiologist for giving advice outside of his area of expertise? Oh right it’s because you do whatever trump tells you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EyesOnQ He is a radiologist. He has no qualifications to serve this role. People are dying because trump does absolutely nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepAndyBiggsAZ @realDonaldTrump Please tell me what is his training? Is he really a radiologist? How in the world should we take advice from him about a pandemic? Looks like you finally found an MD who will pander to Trump.  #VoteBidenHarrisToSaveAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrEricDing Hmmm. So wanting to avoid a potentially fatal and highly contagious illness is selfish. I guess all teachers live alone and have no elderly relatives to worry about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteHouse What is Dr. Atlas’ training in? Infectious diseases? Epidemiology? Oh, wait did you say radiology? Got it. You found an MD who will pander to trump no matter how many people die. #VoteBidenHarrisToSaveAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveMinCA Trump likes this strategy as he does not have to do anything. And where is the @GOP on this? Crickets. 185,000 dead is not enough??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I would caution using the term “do nothing” given how you did nothing to address the pandemic in February and still are basically doing nothing to reduce the rate of infection in the US. You are a do nothing “President”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DefundPhood @RepAdamSchiff At least he is fighting for democracy and rule of law. Trump thinks he is above the law and Barr thinks he is trumps personal lawyer. Dangerous way to govern<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckGrassley Maybe you did not get the memo. All trump has to offer is the same old hateful rhetoric. He has no plans to address the major challenges our country faces regarding the pandemic and systemic racism. He is a failure all around. #voteblue2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CodeRebelUS1 @AynRandPaulRyan @realDonaldTrump @SecretService FYI the evidence is showing that the agitators are from white supremacist groups. Using the crisis to create mayhem and discredit those who are peacefully (and understandably angrily) protesting the murder of a black man in cold blood.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CodeRebelUS1 @AynRandPaulRyan @realDonaldTrump @SecretService More lies and misinformation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@I_Like_Skis @littlestevier @GlencocoN @SteezyCam2 @TheOnlyBilko @EyeWith3rd @ChidiNwatu @realDonaldTrump @SecretService March!

<|startoftext|>@littlestevier @GlencocoN @I_Like_Skis @SteezyCam2 @TheOnlyBilko @EyeWith3rd @ChidiNwatu @realDonaldTrump @SecretService The cases came from Europe. China travel ban was not effective.

Public health has to guide us and our wealthy country should do better. 1 $1200 payment is not enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DukeofDaytona06 @AynRandPaulRyan @realDonaldTrump @SecretService Protests across the country. People are upset all over the country.

<|startoftext|>@CodeRebelUS1 @AynRandPaulRyan @realDonaldTrump @SecretService This Soros allegation is pure antisemitism.

<|startoftext|>@Macbogger1 @longtall6 @RepAdamSchiff They are also pitying us, America, for how poorly we are handling this pandemic. For real.

<|startoftext|>@atrupar So we should be ok that many, many, many people will die for what cause? Trump is a very sick man and the GOP is corrupt and complicit. VPPence is also complicit. Claims to be religious when he allows people to die<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@goodyweaver @CohoeDeidre @SassySwift1 And if people stay no,e that is basically the same as casting a vote for trump and saying goodbye to our already weakened democracy.

<|startoftext|>@ConanTheHeroDog @Whatwitake2019 @alohasons @thehill They never cared before! That the the cover story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ConanTheHeroDog @Whatwitake2019 @alohasons @thehill Facts exist: phone call transcript, aid illegally withheld and only released after the crime was exposed, trumps own words (over and over) heard by everyone, the overheard call, the ousting of the ambassador, private lawyer doing statecraft, obstruction of congress.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ConanTheHeroDog @Whatwitake2019 @alohasons @thehill Ivanka has done what exactly? Kushner has done what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Seipher31 @ConanTheHeroDog @Whatwitake2019 @alohasons @thehill Exactly. The strategy: repeat lies over and over to make them “truth” aka gaslighting, aka propaganda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ConanTheHeroDog @Whatwitake2019 @alohasons @thehill Such BS. They are repeating Russian propaganda about Ukraine and 2016 while doing all they can to damage Biden who is his political opponent. Also since when does trump care about corruption or nepotism? Look at Ivanka, Kushner!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ConanTheHeroDog @Whatwitake2019 @alohasons @thehill Hmmm why were there not more witnesses? Oh right. They were too chicken to testify and ignored lawful subpoenas. Also the “transcript” of the call was evidence enough. “I’d like you to do us a favor though...”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just subscribed to Letters from an American  https://t.co/XVFDFOLgtP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@karynmarie26 @SenSchumer Actually it is about getting to the truth. If I was accused of murder should I get to ignore subpoenas? Should I get to control who testifies?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kingrandy78 @SenSchumer This is so wrong I cannot imagine e where you get your “facts”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MJBregg @SenSchumer Yes the accused refuses to participate. If he did nothing wrong then why withhold documents and prevent people from testifying? Why does he hide his tax returns?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer Please stay strong and do not cave. Do not make deals with @senatemajldr who reneges on agreements such as after the shutdown when he agreed there would be a fix for Dreamers. Just hold firm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ConanTheHeroDog @Whatwitake2019 @alohasons @thehill It became absolute necessary to impeach as he is trying to impact our elections so that he wins. The only reason there was no GOP support is that they are corrupt, complicit or afraid of trumps reaction.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@santiagomayer_ @KennysLittleBro Fake dem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusanVogel8 So I was impressed that you did not use insults and slurs in your prior tweets. Alas you could not hold back. Why, why, why do trump supporters always slung insults. Taking after their beloved trump. The bar is so low these days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusanVogel8 We are also fired up! And ready to hold the House, turn the senate and make trump a one term president. He is toxic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fail by @TulsiGabbard for impeachment. Vote true blue<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TulsiGabbard should never be our candidate. Voting present for impeachment! You have shown your true colors now. A Republican in blue clothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TulsiGabbard You voted present at the impeachment! And you claim to be a democrat. Will never support your campaign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepGosar @SusanVogel8 That was not a “fake transcript” he was making it sound like a mob boss putting the squeeze on someone. Which it basically was: “Do me a favor though”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusanVogel8 The hurry just might have to do with the 2020 election. The courts could take up to 8 months to rule and then the witness could still refuse to answer specific questions and they will then have to go to court again. It is better to get it done and move on. And done it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusanVogel8 The House has the sole responsibility for Impeachment. Not the courts or the senate. The Senate can then convict which they won’t but Trump will still be impeached.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusanVogel8 Separate branches yes! So why is Mitch McConnell coordinating with the WH. Not very separate if you ask me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusanVogel8 Actually the reason for not waiting is because trump is trying to sway the election. If we wait for the courts to enforce the ignored subpoenas the election would happen first and trump would continue interfering in our election. Cuz he cannot win without cheating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fact check: Trump lost the popular vote!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time to remind y’all that more Americans voted against trump than for trump in 2016. Just say’n<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok so the GOP keeps lying and omitting information when they speak. If you still believe they care about our democracy you are believing in a false narrative. #ImpeachAndRemove  https://t.co/Yp9evB3aPx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusanVogel8 Subpoenas were issued and ignored. The people who did testify were brave to defy trumps demand that no one testify. If he did nothing wrong then why is he preventing testimony and withholding documents. If he did nothing wrong why is he tweeting 100 times in one day?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusanVogel8 Of course! With #MoscowMitch as leader.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>.@RepMikeJohnson more false talking points. Gaslighting and propaganda. To push the narrative that trump is concerned about corruption is ludicrous given the heads of state he admires.  Come on. High School students that I know are appalled by the trump administration and the GOP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@RepMcClintock you seem to have forgotten the text messages and emails. You seem to think that the public will be so gullible as to believe trump is concerned about corruption writ large. Also trump declined to testify and to send witnesses.#CorruptGOP #ImpeachAndRemove<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@replouiegohmert repeating #Barr talking point and lies. The IG report found that there was no spying and there was a valid reason to investigate trump campaign.

<|startoftext|>.@replouiegohmert is insulting and demeaning of the admirable witnesses who testified and have served our country. Calling their testimony gossip.

<|startoftext|>@SteveScalise Where are the requested documents? And the other witnesses? Oh right, trump is obstructing yet another inquiry by forbidding people from testifying and withholding documents. You only tell a fraction of the story here!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AriFleischer @RepRatcliffe Please tell me why it’s ok for a private citizen to carry out foreign policy that is kept secret from those charges with carrying out foreign policy? That seems shady to say the least.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr @RepRatcliffe Hmm wonder why he felt he had to kow tow to trump.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan Watched your bizarre statement “it did not happen!”  I understand that gaslighting is a major trump strategy but your statements take the cake. The call did happen. Giuliani did carry on in ways not befitting a private citizen. Something is rotten here and it is trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jdawsey1 Exactly!!! I have been reminding all the GOP sycophants about that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan And people died! And this is total BS. You are part of the problem in your blind support of trump. Where are his tax returns? Why is it ok for his children to have roles in our government?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump I will again remind you all that at least ten people are defying subpoenas because they are putting trump over our country. Why not have everyone testify? Trump too? And what about the document requested? The sham is the GOP, or what is left of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan Um. Let’s review the long list of people refusing to testify even when subpoenad. Let’s also look at all of the documents not provided. If there was nothing wrong why all the obstruction?   It is rich coming from the party that could not stop talking about Hillary’s emails.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RepMarkMeadows Actually you can read the whole statement of William Taylor. It is quite clear that trump has done wrong. And his private lawyer was engaging in foreign policy to benefit trump in 2020. Your word has no value is all you say are lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jdawsey1 It doesn’t work that way. Just saying you did no wrong does no make it true. This is NOT a smear campaign. It is abuse of power. Period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I understand it is hard to be wrong. It is hard to support someone and realize they have done something very wrong. Open your minds to the facts. Trump extorted the president of a Ukraine to give him an advantage in the 2020 election. This is wrong!! #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The problem is not the process but the subject of the hearings. @GOP @LindseyGrahamSC @GOPLeader @senatemajldr @MarkMeadows I read the statement by William Taylor. #ImpeachAndRemoveTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just read William Taylor’s full statement. It clearly details quid pro quo, an “irregular” foreign policy carried out by trump’s private lawyer and withholding valuable aid from Ukraine. Damaging our standing in the world. #ImpeachAndRemoveTrumpNOW<|endoftext|>

Also republicans are given equal time for questions. Also trump abused powered G7 conference. Remember our constitution?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMarkMeadows Uh. You must have missed a lot of news because 1)quid pro quo is not necessary 2)seems like there was quid pro quo 3) the removal of the ambassador was clearly politically motivated 4) trump abuse power in his conversation w/ Zelensky.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MsPackyetti This story is so distressing. And another example<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Freedom91666611 @JeriLudwig @politico Again you are buying an unfounded trump narrative about Mexican people. While there are some gangsters and drug dealers that does not account for the majority of them. Trumps hateful rhetoric is just that, rhetoric. The goal is to have angry followers who will accept anything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigUn81937107 @JeriLudwig @politico To send money to their families in other counties. Why is that a problem? Why do you not see undocumented immigrants as human beings trying to make a good life just like you. Does America stand for I got mine and who cares about the other guy?  Not for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1striiiingshort @JeriLudwig @politico Another false narrative brought to you by trump and radical right wing propaganda. Our deficit has ballooned under trump, the tax cuts are costing America billions and dissent is patriotic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now we see how @realDonaldTrump has a disastrous foreign policy as he kowtows to dictators and allows Turkish troops to kill Kurds, free Isis soldiers and even strand US Troops. For what??? #RemoveTrumpNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maggieNYT Good riddance to bad rubbage. #CrimesAgainstHumanity #CrimesAgainstChildren #closethecamps<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeriLudwig @politico Don’t believe the either or. They are not taking anything from you. They pay taxes, they contribute to their communities. The inequality we feel is due to the wealthy getting tax cuts and the income discrepancy in our country. It is bad economics. Not immigrants<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DennisWalker @davidmweissman I agree. The poisonous lies took root in too many vulnerable minds<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PamelaGuisto @LindseyGrahamSC Obama had zero scandals during 8 years. Trump has a scandal a day. Cannot keep cabinet members. He has lied 10,000 times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC @PamelaGuisto Trump is not above the law. He cannot currently be indicted but once we vote him out of office watch out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PamelaGuisto @4YrsToday @vooda1 Where do you get your information action? Honestly. We had the worst recession in 2008. Obama cleaned up Bush’s mess and trump claims credit. Classic con man. You have been duped.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PamelaGuisto @4YrsToday @vooda1 Where were you in 2008? Do you remember the crash caused by Bush a republican?  And President Obama brought our country back out of the hole. Under trump our deficit is growing due to tax cuts for the rich.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Russian interference in our elections is not a #hoax as the @HouseGOP and @realDonaldTrump  would like us to believe. Thus Russia attacked our elections in 2016 and not enough is being done now to mitigate this in 2020 #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@realDonaldTrump has turned our government into a reality show. @HouseGOP why stacking up so many books Mr. Turner. Trump is NOT exonerated. End of story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shouldn’t @DevinNunes recuse himself due to conflict of interest? I seem to recall a night time run to @realDonaldTrump. Nines cannot be trusted to have our best interests at heart. Trump is his primary concern.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The corruption of @realDonaldTrump and his campaign has nothing to do with Clinton or #fusiongps. Stop trying to distract the American People from the obvious obstruction of justice on the part of #trump. @DevinNunes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@RepDLesko I am not a lawyer and I do read footnotes. Trying to prove #mueller is biased is absurd! If he was biased he would have urged #impeachment proceeding. Also #Mueller recouped the money his investigation cost. What about taxpayer $ funding trump playing golf.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Attempts to obstruct justice are criminal acts even if they fail! @RepDLesko knows this yet infers that because #Mueller was not fired than no obstruction occurred. Again #republican twisting legal terms to undermine #Muellerinvestigation<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonalChink @HouseJudiciary Actually you do NOT have to show where obstruction impacted the investigation. That is false. The act of obstruction of justice is in and of itself a crime.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoddardRiv @lighthousegld I agree!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Aha. You now admit that your election happened with help from Russia. And remember who won the popular vote... not you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Mueller did NOT absolve you of obstruction although he would have if he could have. So you are NOT exonerated. If you are so innocent let the House investigate. What are you hiding? #ResignTrump<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lighthousegld @GoddardRiv How about nature related activities?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonalChink @HouseJudiciary Because Mueller said he would have said if no crime was committed. He did not say so. So.... and this is one of the mandates of Congress: to check presidential power. Trump thinks he is a king.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity Finally he said that there were “Multiple systematic efforts to interfere in our election and that deserves the attention of every American” so why are you ignoring this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity so he said “Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to accuse a president of a crime.” Which does t sound like moving on but like a referral for #impeachment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanhannity I think you spaced out during the short conference as he said ““If we had concluded the president had not committed a crime we would have said so! “<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan Also he said that there were “Multiple systematic effort to interfere in our election and that deserves the attention of every American “. And we should move on?!! And you call yourself a patriot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan Actually he made a referral for impeachment and said “If we had concluded the president had not committed a crime we would have said so! “ so... he must have committed the crime of obstruction<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/UJGIYmtNJk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IlhanMN Exactly. The essence of what he said. I agree 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec Also he said “Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to accuse a president of a crime.”  That sounds like #impeachment to me. The house needs to hold trump to account.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec I hope you realize that this is spin. Mueller said  “If we had concluded the president had not committed a crime we would have said so! “ so why didn’t he just say no crime was committed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffLandry @realDonaldTrump Nope not quite right. He did not bring charges because he is thebsitting president. He said “ “If we had concluded the president had not committed a crime we would have said so! “. Think about that. Why didn’t the report clearly absolve trump? Because it couldn’t. #ImpeachTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HouseJudiciary Impeachment proceedings must begin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenThomTillis @realDonaldTrump Do you realize trump was the one using the non legal term “collusion”. Not the house Dems. They did say there have been obvious attempts to obstruct justice and countless lies. Which were witnessed by the American people. #ImpeachDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC Yes. And how come trump still says it was a hoax?! And you do not care<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC Also he said there were   “ Multiple systematic effort to interfere in our election and that deserves the attention of every American”. What about that? Shall we move on from the unequivocal statement that Russia interferes in our elections? You used to care about our sovereignty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC Also he said that ““If we had concluded the president had not committed a crime we would have said so! “ So as far as I can tell it is up to Congress to look into his obvious attempts to obstruct the Mueller investigation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC That is not we said actually. He said “the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to accuse a president of a crime.”  Hmmm what might that be? #impeachment perhaps.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump So please explain why my taxes tripled while my income did not. #TaxScam #TaxScamStories<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP Prosperity for who? Not me and all the people reporting paying higher taxes or receiving lower refunds. My tax bill is so high I need to go into debt to pay it. I am guessing the prosperity is for those who are  already wealthy. #taxscam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/12hBoIn8Jc via @NYTimes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DontFollow_Jake @BuschBeer But a tiny amount. And then we end up paying it and then some. So no tax cut for the middle class.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1) congress should have the Mueller report without redaction (Barr cannot be trusted) 2)Trump must release his tax returns to congress. (Trump cannot be trusted) 3) #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/rlRKrZrQKi<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GOP Please explain why my taxes increased and I now have to go into debt to pay. I work full time and have much less money in my pocket thanks to your #taxscam don’t believe the @GOP and their lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sfor4th I am devastated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Allonsy88 I am trying hard not to cry in public. Devastating. My favorite building in the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So 60 major corporations are paying 0 in taxes, the uber wealthy have seen their taxes go down and I have to go into debt to pay my taxes which have gone up at least 3x. #TaxScam #VoteBlue2020 trickle down economics is a scam.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AllForOne78 @JenniLynn2017 @LISASFAR @gtdombex @toniprzy @RepAdamSchiff His problems go way deeper than that.

All. The. Time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMarkMeadows You are part of the problem. You are blinded by trump and have lost your way. We need to see the Mueller report now. And also trump’s tax returns. What are you all hiding?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllForOne78 @LISASFAR @JenniLynn2017 @gtdombex @toniprzy @RepAdamSchiff We have gotten way off the topic of what a terrible president trump is.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LISASFAR @AllForOne78 @JenniLynn2017 @gtdombex @toniprzy @RepAdamSchiff Exactly. They should be held to a higher standard! We have higher expectations of 7 year olds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllForOne78 @LISASFAR @JenniLynn2017 @gtdombex @toniprzy @RepAdamSchiff But he paid the hush money during the campaign. And then lied and lied and lied about it. Why trust this man with our country? He certainly cannot govern in any sane or intelligent way.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JenniLynn2017 @AllForOne78 @gtdombex @LISASFAR @toniprzy @RepAdamSchiff Yes. Exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllForOne78 @JenniLynn2017 @gtdombex @LISASFAR @toniprzy @RepAdamSchiff How about no ceo? That would sit better for me. Trump is all about profits and not about the common good of human beings. He worships the all mighty dollar and nothing else. Don’t let him fool you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllForOne78 @toniprzy @RepAdamSchiff How can you say that for real? He has never done those gestures again which indicates that it was deliberate.

<|startoftext|>@seliw59 @toniprzy @RepAdamSchiff I know what I see and hear with my own eyes and ears. I am no blindly swallowing lies.

<|startoftext|>@AllForOne78 @toniprzy @RepAdamSchiff Really?! Did you not see the video that we all saw. He was referencing a journalist with a disability and imitating his movements. Just like a 3rd grade bully would do. Come on. Get real.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MaketheRoadNY @DenDekkerAD34 @es_indivisible @FairElectionsNY @strongforall @bkindivisible @citizenactionny @nychange @NYWFP @MariMendHer @mkink It would be good to know where you stand.

<|startoftext|>@makeNYTrueBlue @DenDekkerAD34 @es_indivisible @Getorgbk @bkindivisible @FairElectionsNY @jesswisneski @QueensResist @NewQNSDemocrats @one_queens @NoIDCNY So which is it?

<|startoftext|>We believe that love is love. People have a right to self agency and self definition. No law should determine your gender expression or which bathroom you use.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We believe that children belong with their families, not in cages with Mylar blankets. Not at the mercy of for profit prisons where they are subject to abuse and neglect. Where some have died and all are traumatized.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We believe that addressing income inequality and getting big money out of politics is essential to a robust democracy. As is the right to vote and the right to a justice system that works for all people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We believe that taking care of this planet that is our home is of critical importance. Addressing climate change is the real emergency. Putting profits first only endangers all of us. Rich, poor or in between but usually poor, underrepresented communities pay the price first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We believe seeking asylum is legal. Diversity makes America great.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We want healthcare to work for everyone in the country. Medicare for all. Women’s reproductive freedom. Reasonable prescription costs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We want domestic terrorism to be taken seriously and not addressed with thoughts and prayers and there are good people on both sides bs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We want to reform our immigration system so that it actually works to allow people to legally immigrate here without it taking a decade. We want DACA recipients and TPS recipients to have a pathway to citizenship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We want common sense regulations on gun purchases to decrease the astronomical rates of guns violence in our country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We cannot let @realDonaldTrump,     @VP and the @GOP steer the narrative. There is no such thing as  infanticide, Democrats do not want “open borders”, we are not coming for your guns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is very clear to me that our country has done a terrible job of teaching history which in part has led us to this moment where trump supporters and supposedly educated members of the @GOP follow trump blindly in his authoritarian ways.

<|startoftext|>@whitbama @PressSec @realDonaldTrump Tooth and nail yes. For the soul of our country. There is no crisis at the border! Trump could open the government today but he does not care. All he cares about is further weakening our democracy and appeasing a minority.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec @realDonaldTrump Fair deal? Really? How do you sleep at night spinning trump’s horrific presidency into something “normal”. Trump tried to end DACA a year ago.

<|startoftext|>@thefakecarmona Keep it for 2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So now the @GOP and @realDonaldTrump and @marcorubio think counting all the votes is rigging the election. If this does not convince you that our democracy is under attack than you are hiding your head in the sand. Do you value democracy? Do you want an autocracy?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The answer's gotta be #9640ParkRoads, @Allstate. What do you think?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I say a new presidential election would be good! This one  was certainly rigged due to voter suppression, gerrymandering and most likely help from the Russians. Oh and more people voted for Clinton. More people wanted Clinton to win #abolishtheelectoralcollege<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PressSec Wait! I watched this video over and over. First trump yells at and insults a reporter (unacceptable) then a woman tries to grab, yes grab, mike from reporter. His hand touches her arm. That’s it. This is suppression of the press. This is wrong. You are wrong.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan I assume you missed everything trump has said and done to disrespect so many people and to encourage violence at his rallies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@William17381225 @JuddLegum The republicans are below ground at least ours are above.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Turnip2020 He really is talking about himself. He never thinks. He can’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuddLegum Really why do they have such high standards?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goldengateblond And why don’t the press push back. That other reporter grabbing the mike to appease trumpnwith another question about trade.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @senatemajldr you basically think this Weeknis a sham and have made up your mind. I cannot wait until I can work on getting you out of office if we have a Democracy after you are done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ll help!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A most destructive man!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevengberman @jamiedupree That’s what I feared. So it comes down to @SenatorCollins and @lisamurkowski<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamiedupree @stevengberman Can cloture be blocked?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No cloture. We need full debate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hughhewitt @LindseyGrahamSC @senatemajldr @FBI No cloture. No plowing through major concerns even before allegations. We need full debate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dangchick1 As a white woman I am in total agreement. It sickens me that so many voted for trump and now support Kavanaugh. Please know there are many who feel as you do.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@earlforagirl @ProfAlang @SenGillibrand And yes this hearing is not the way to determine anyone’s guilt. It is very concerning to see such a spectacle when there are ways they could have proceeded. Now they are giving one week to determine the veracity of her story. Not enough time and just a political move.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@earlforagirl @ProfAlang @SenGillibrand I wish a possible future Supreme Court Justice would be more temperate and nonpartisan. I agree that we do not know what happened in 82 but his credibility is in question and he is still a bad choice.  https://t.co/xuOlCSgosH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is not what we saw from #Kavanagh this week. He was arrogant, intemperate and highly partisan. @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins @Sen_JoeManchin #VoteNoKavanaugh #KavaNO  https://t.co/stx3rd8G9C<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonVen4 @SenGillibrand His views are radical and highly partisan. He should be in politics not on the Supreme Court.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonVen4 @SenGillibrand Her decision was based on his judicial record and his dissenting statements on a case incoming g abortion and on another case. Also his opinions on presidential powers. This is just further reason to vote no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@earlforagirl @SenGillibrand She has already said she would vote no based on the fact that he would vote to end many civil rights and freedoms. He was a bad choice before we learned all of this. Allegations or no it is #KavaNO<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MSNBC Norms have been smashed by @senatemajldr @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump don’t accuse Democrats of breaking norms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JRubinBlogger @kathieallenmd Exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeSupport45 @realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC @DNC Hahahahah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Kavanaugh does not have the temperament for this position but of course you cannot see that because the same applies to you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanielZHornung I was thinking the same thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnK29354799 She asked for confidentiality. Also after his testimony today it is clear that he is deep in the GOP pockets and does not have the proper temperament to have a LIFE-LONG seat making decisions about our lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NancyVagias @Devil_Dog_614 @ForAmerica I have a PhD in psychology and know that is not so easy. Why doesn’t he take one if he has nothing to hide?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShadedMika @ForAmerica What about a polygraph? She passed several and he has yet to take one?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShadedMika @ForAmerica They have not done any sort of investigation or heard from any other potential witnesses under oath. She has passed more than one polygraph and has not agreed to take a single one. Why??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ForAmerica FBI and polygraph. That must happen now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ForAmerica They have been asking for an FBI investigation but the GOP has blocked it. Why? Why no polygraph?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because he does not care!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanielleMuscato Nope!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So we have a president who gives frequent pep rallies to his base (and paid attendees) but cannot give a coherent press conference and has only given 2 in almost 2 years. Wake up! @GOP @DNC  https://t.co/RlUbpq2kxn<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Sissy4Trump @Kat13794016 @clairecmc He is clearly unfit, unhinged and is not taking the business of governing seriously. Have you heard him speak with his limited vocabulary and rambling comments?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MMBTycalibre @Kat13794016 @clairecmc That why we need the laws and regulations. Including campaign finance laws that get money out of politics.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@time2trade2 @grmoore @Kat13794016 @clairecmc Also this line about moving to another country is obnoxious and meaningless. You could move to another country too, like North Korea<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@time2trade2 @grmoore @Kat13794016 @clairecmc I beg to differ.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timc3737 @TonyofTiriolo @Kat13794016 @clairecmc regulation does not mean absolute control. Trusting big business and the wealthy to not succumb to greed is just plain naive. There is middle ground that does not have to mean socialism or brutal capitalism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grmoore @Kat13794016 @clairecmc what does that even mean? bye bye<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrs_rios125 @Kat13794016 @clairecmc I actually know people who live another countries and who are well cared for by their governments.

<|startoftext|>@karenhoosier @CNN He has caused so much damage to our country and democracy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@teachliberty @Kat13794016 @clairecmc I agree that the middle class gets screwed but that is not because of “les government” that is a concept that so do not believe works in such a populous and complex society.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LittleRedPill1 @Kat13794016 @clairecmc @POTUS Also I seem to recall 2008 being a collapse of our economy brought to us by the republicans. Why do people seem to forget the recent past?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LittleRedPill1 @Kat13794016 @clairecmc @POTUS The fantasy is that trump is anything approaching a president. And anyone who swallows his daily lies. He lives outside of reality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LittleRedPill1 @Kat13794016 @clairecmc Read Democracy In Chains and get back to me. These memes mean nothing to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@teachliberty @Kat13794016 @clairecmc I did not say I don’t like government, I detest the current administration and their isolationist approach. We are the only developed nation without healthcare!   Why? Because people should take care of themselves no matter what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LittleRedPill1 @Kat13794016 @clairecmc How can you support a government that wants to cut healthcare, Medicare, social security? and lock children up in cages and lose track of them? Who only care for the wealthy? I’ll take Dems anytime over the GOP.<|endoftext|>
