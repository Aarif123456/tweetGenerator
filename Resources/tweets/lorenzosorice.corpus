<|startoftext|>@Solomethod @Ken53924456 @AlbertBreer Enough lineman? They have one starter in Jonah and an average center in Trey. They picked up two journeyman guards.  They absolutely need Sewell. If he pans out you have protection on Burrow‚Äôs blindside for a decade. There‚Äôs 1st round talent at WR every year at the draft and FA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zimwhodey Depends if anyone comes to them with a trade offer. But I don‚Äôt want Turner anywhere near him.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wiisportsgod69 @BengalsCaptain @NFLonFOX Burrow scored 30...his second game as a pro with next to no off season. Took a few sacks, sure. Made plenty of plays and stepped up too.  And the 2nd meeting between them two? Burrow had the game won, defense imploded.  What bearing does that have on the original statement?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wiisportsgod69 @BengalsCaptain @NFLonFOX You act like this is a common occurrence. Is this single freak play all you know about Burrow? Let me refresh you...  https://t.co/E2PFcTgkNJ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoeGoodberry Yup. Looking forward to steelers in buffalo. FTS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jake_NFL up 17-7 is awfully generous with how the offense has been the past few weeks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jake_NFL @iPrOLilMan Which is why I'm not too high on AJ right now on this game. Can he do anything impressive closing out these last games...tbd...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeGoodberry  https://t.co/toBEBr2Xmm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jake_NFL Yup, but the refs with the late whistle should of let him play it out...then decide on the replay. They let him get up and start running 15-10 yards first.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Darkshowers_ @MelonieMac Ya I understand. Kid of the 90s cartoons myself. Had the same gripes with X-men. Saturday morning cartoons have been replaced with Mando for me.  https://t.co/ujCw7FXpw2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darkshowers_ @MelonieMac Appreciate the Spidey talk though. I may not fully agree with your opinions, but totally see where you're coming from and respect it. ü§ô<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darkshowers_ @MelonieMac Fair enough, but that's why it's the MCU not Spiderverse.  It's just difficult translating comic or video games to live action movie series for a cohesive story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...and it just occurred to me that their is only one more episode of #TheMandalorian this season. üò©<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darkshowers_ @MelonieMac Yup, Spidey 2 was great. But at some point you hit a wall...IE Spiderman 3. No full vision for the franchise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MelonieMac Sure, but agree to disagree. I feel like each is "good" in it's own rights. But having each movie isolated would make world building next to impossible and pigeon holed. They're all too intertwined. In my eyes, why Venom had such a hard time in the grand scheme of things...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darkshowers_ @MelonieMac There isn't one linear story in the comics either. They're all adaptations with new creative direction.  Like you said...this is Disney's in the MCU.  We won't ever get a direct comic to film adaptation...it doesn't always translate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MelonieMac Agreed, but apple to oranges? Excuse my ignorance on Lara Croft, but she is clearly the stand out MAIN character. MCU is set up quite differently...universe building at this point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MelonieMac I get what you're saying, but he isn't a stand alone character. I've had patience with the MCU cause everyone has their moment of badassery.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MelonieMac The literal changing point though. Taking things into his own hands, stepping up.. Sony didn't have a full vision. At this point Stark is intertwined with the MCU so much he's always going to be a shadow.  https://t.co/6s3gvWdG83<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Rob444D @Zesty256 @LndsPatterson @NewStripeCity They‚Äôre not fixing the team in one off season/draft with all the holes they still have.  Best option is let burrow work. Outscore everyone. Think chiefs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rob444D @Zesty256 @LndsPatterson @NewStripeCity They don‚Äôt even have a 3rd starter. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre talking about. Who‚Äôs talking about 4th or 5th...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thewanderer2020 @LndsPatterson The offense is Burrow. It will be stagnant without him like last year. Play calls are questionable.  Lou still can‚Äôt call a defense.  Who narrow minded? Nothing‚Äôs different. Debatably worst. Insanity to keep this same staff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thewanderer2020 @LndsPatterson 6 wins under ZT over 2 years isn‚Äôt exactly ‚Äúbuilding a winning culture‚Äù.  Lose out. Fire the staff. Set up the next staff with Burrow and solid picks.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thebengalorian Last thing the locker room needs. Plus, he‚Äôs just bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BadDonkeyGaming @Josh_Kirkendall Certain level of respect should be expected in the workplace.  Both Lou and Turner had this past known and nothing to show for it when they were hired...both bad hires.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrunkBengalsfan The bar was low. Show semblance of being a competent coach. He hasn‚Äôt. Burrow covered it up. Defense still couldn‚Äôt.  ZT won‚Äôt act like a head coach in charge....so fire them all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IngrahamAngle de¬∑lu¬∑sion noun an idiosyncratic belief or impression that is firmly maintained despite being contradicted by what is generally accepted as reality or rational argument, typically a symptom of mental disorder."the delusion of being watched"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LndsPatterson Fire Turner and Lou. If ZT doesn‚Äôt, then fire him too.  We‚Äôve seen this team last year without a QB in this same staff. Defense even more injured. What‚Äôs different?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vancemeek @BengalsNation8 It was clearly stated how Jim Turner was an he was brought in anyway.  There were rumors about Lou before this report as well. Even before he got to Cincy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EliseJesseTV @JamesRapien  https://t.co/7kjPquL4Yi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EliseJesseTV @TJCarpenterShow Also, last I checked. You should expect a certain level of respect in the workplace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewStripeCity Protect the franchise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bengals 4 wins in two seasons. Inexcusable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bengals And just like last year. No reason to watch. Draft season comes early again.  We‚Äôve seen what ZT is without a high caliber QB to bail him out. Every game will be a blow out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vancemeek Every team deals with injuries...we just don't have the coaching staff to overcome it. ZT has no idea what he's doing.  No one on the staff is proven...to any extent.  No worthwhile clearly wants to come work for the Brown family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mdleslie @DrunkBengalsfan Taylor‚Äôs the Valet driver. Without a care and no accountability.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LndsPatterson üëÄ Hopefully the damage is minimal.  We all know Joey B's work ethic is insane and will do everything he possibly can to get to 100%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lockedonbengals Thanks guys. @Jake_NFL @JamesRapien  https://t.co/sibhvsdhOy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarthNoobSaibot Only reason why I'd want Ross even out there. Just have him sprint down the field. At least he takes a CB or S with him as a decoy.  Combine and draft time is going to get interesting. I don't see us winning another game and picking any later than 3 without a tradeback.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BengalsMike @Jake_NFL Palmer‚Äôs was clear cheap shot.  Burrow‚Äôs was MJ getting bullied all game and blocked the defender back towards to the QB low.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scottwabnitz @JayMorrisonATH What does a win with Findley at QB accomplish other than likely having the same OL next year? No Burrow stunts the whole offense and the defense is what they are under Lou.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinRo25535419 @Adamh985 @FauxJeaux I‚Äôm not sure we really have to tank. Findley will take care of the rest of the season pretty easily.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DruQuigley @RapSheet And/or the no. 1 pick potentially for a king‚Äôs ransom.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@vancemeek can't wait for that asshat to talk about accountability.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheTylerDragon Falls on coaching. Can‚Äôt believe in it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@commissioneryas Firing this inept coaching staff who trotted out this horrid oline will go towards the healing and future well being of Burrow.  It sucks, but accountability falls on this staff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bengalsjunkie @Jake_NFL With this staff, questioned coming into the season...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CR72411 @DarthNoobSaibot @JillyJSB @Cincinneumeyer @TomPelissero This wasn‚Äôt even homophobic. But ok.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bengals Can‚Äôt wait to hear #ZacTaylor talk about accountability all while not taking any.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBCSports #fireZacTaylor #fireJimTurner<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jake_NFL Yup. We‚Äôve had none. No investment into protecting the franchise. ZT‚Äôs stay is likely longer...because this franchise loves to use injury as an excuse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarthNoobSaibot @CR72411 @JillyJSB @Cincinneumeyer @TomPelissero Buddy came back to this the next day in between getting off the Steelers players? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bengals Zero investment into protecting the OL will do that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesRapien Zac Taylor‚Äôs blind support of Jim Turner and making zero investment into protecting the franchise did this. This whole staff should be fired on this game alone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheTylerDragon Terrible coaching and management will do that to you. #fireZacTaylor #fireJimTurner<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bengals @JoeyB #fireZacTaylor for his blind support of Jim Turner. For his inability to do anything about the oline. Horrible. Can‚Äôt even protect the franchise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeGoodberry AJ and Burrow miss communication and a dropped INT...it would seem. üòë<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jake_NFL yup, the inconsistency is maddening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdwardEmerling @JoeGoodberry Randy isn't even consistent. Never know what you get with him any given day...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bengals Doesn't matter. Special teams has been questionable.  Need consistency, if anything at kicker. Fat Randy and Erickson can go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ben_Baby Just have Huber kick. Randy‚Äôs calves aren‚Äôt up for it today.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@commissioneryas  https://t.co/i2O0wFHf5i<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarthNoobSaibot ....but he's clutch down 28.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FauxJeaux pullin' calves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jake_NFL Didn't they sign another kicker? Or was he cut after the Browns game and calve/calves injuries or whatever?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mrlalance @CarlosAndre31 @BenjiWhelan @vancemeek ZT has made changes on defense? Lou still there. Defense still horrible. Coverages still horrible.  Burrow elevated ZTs offense. Should be the other way around.  This staff can‚Äôt get the most out of any player, and it shows.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TechDeals_16 There‚Äôs a fine for not wearing a seat belt too. For your own and public safety. Rarely is it enforced by itself.  How is this different?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BenjiWhelan @vancemeek I think having Burrow makes it attractive. What team wouldn‚Äôt have drafted him 1st overall if they needed a QB.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrEkli @moderated_mike @peterfish95 @thehill and nothing in your list has to do with transition either. The presidential win was accepted. Obama met with him in the WH numerous times.  HE wasn't accepted.  Was the public and intelligence agencies just supposed to blindly support his and never question his moves?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@brooke_hayhurst @McJesse This was during the spring, but we are clearly back at this point.  Did NC lift these restrictions?   "occupancy can‚Äôt be more than 20% of their fire-code capacity, or above 5 customers per 1,000 square feet"   https://t.co/HwoDcPfrCW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jake_NFL Man, I really question this team's medical staff and (lack of) ability to use a more lax IR this year.  I'd love a hungry Tak pressuring QBs this second half of the year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jake_NFL If he wasn't medically cleared last, why now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@libshipwreck 70 degrees one day and then 35 degrees the next doesn't help much either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markknoller That's cool and all, but Trump lost GA twice now.  Keep that base riled up and donating so they pay off his campaign debts.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@paulhardware The real answer Paul...  https://t.co/BksxZNYyzJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeGoodberry Fair. I tend to support the players if they've proved themselves, but Cincy staff hasn't exactly elevated anyone IMO. Have to win some games in this upcoming stretch, it's getting warmer.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@therealBerdman @BengalsCaptain Buddy...it ain‚Äôt hard. Your whole feed is acting like a tough guy for the Steelers. You might want to be a little more professional on the internet Doc...you would think you‚Äôd be a bit smarter...  https://t.co/migEmJaVyw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BengalsCaptain @therealBerdman @James_E_Akers Ya...can‚Äôt find any. The NFL had to literally make rule changes though for how cheap/dirty the Steelers have historical played.

<|startoftext|>@LndsPatterson Killer garbage time fake punt though! üôÑ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>10-36, 5min left in the 4th. Anemic offensive effort. And this is why I bought a Bengals Brain shirt from @JoeGoodberry today instead of an NFL licensed tee from Cincy. #WhoDey #SeizeTheDEY<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChaChaslide88 @INeedAHerro @MacroholicsAnon @IlhanMN WTF do you want? "Do you want a cookie?"  Don't take 100k loan out for a career that is only going to offer you a 45k salary?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChaChaslide88 @INeedAHerro @MacroholicsAnon @IlhanMN Then explain it to me like I'm a 5 year old.  Don't take out a 100k loan for a job that you will only make 45k at? Does that 45k job have room to growth.  You aren't even staying on topic. Again, I said generally education is too damn expensive. But be responsible...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@INeedAHerro @ChaChaslide88 @MacroholicsAnon @IlhanMN No? Did I say that? Poverty in this country is a whole separate issue.  People are in student loan debt because they are irresponsible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChaChaslide88 @INeedAHerro @MacroholicsAnon @IlhanMN Um? What? You‚Äôre rambling...  I went to school for 4.5 years. Took out nearly 100k in loans. Worked in college. Got my BA. Started out at 42k. Increased yearly. Paid off my loan. Been renting. Went through 1 car payment. Have a new car now. Live/rent in Chicago.  Responsibility.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peanutbuster01 @ChaChaslide88 @INeedAHerro @MacroholicsAnon @IlhanMN I‚Äôm not following...the student loan debt is caused by taking out loans. The means are there. Be responsible for how much to take out in loans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChaChaslide88 @INeedAHerro @MacroholicsAnon @IlhanMN No. It sounds like I want people to make responsible decisions.  Don't live beyond your means. Work hard and pay your way.  To just wipe away debt someone racked up is BS.  I think the larger issue is how expensive education has become. Mine was over 100k as well.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lupusmortuus @6uffalob0n3r @Will845_ @JosephPMatron @NFL_Memes @NFLHumor No they still count. I don‚Äôt believe any state has reported 100%.

<|startoftext|>@lupusmortuus @6uffalob0n3r @Will845_ @JosephPMatron @NFL_Memes @NFLHumor I went into this tonight assuming we wouldn‚Äôt have an answer tonight. PA requested 3 days to count votes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lupusmortuus @6uffalob0n3r @Will845_ @JosephPMatron @NFL_Memes @NFLHumor Because some can be called based off history, counties voted, population. Order which votes are counted. Etc.  Idk if we‚Äôll have WI, MI, GA, or PA tonight.  For instance only 10% of early vote in in MI. They project 50-60% being early vote. PA is similar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@windycityneolib @HeathMayo He‚Äôs going to lose the popular vote by 10+ mil...whether he wins the EC or not.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lupusmortuus @JosephPMatron @Will845_ @NFL_Memes @NFLHumor Again 100mil early votes. That‚Äôs unprecedented. They won‚Äôt be called tonight. They‚Äôll be counting well into tomorrow in PA/MI.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lupusmortuus @Will845_ @JosephPMatron @NFL_Memes @NFLHumor GA at 80%, trending higher than 2016 dem votes. NC at 90%. NC was razer thin margins in 2018.  It‚Äôs going to come down to PA, MI, WI.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aSciEnthusiast 100mil early votes reported. 80mil votes currently accounted for in these projections. The fact that this is even close after these past few years is depressing.

<|startoftext|>@AllBengals Siding with players here. Has Lou ever coached let alone put together a defense? He's been suspect for 1.5 seasons now even when players are healthy. Constant coverage and lack of pressure issues.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MarkSpille @JoeGoodberry @TylerBattista2 They took down the "misinformation" because no one else has access to it.  NYP is a right biased news source. Little fishy.  So no, they won't allow conspiracies to spread without numerous news sources reporting it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkSpille @JoeGoodberry @TylerBattista2 oh, here we go again.  The "censoring of free speech" card on a private platform.  Words have consequences...especially when they violate TOS.  It's not censoring. It's filtering out the false BS.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@vancemeek @whodey0102 @ahanes1 seems to me like the coaching staff is losing the team and in turn...will lose the fanbase.  Especially when they want to put people who have been in the building for only a few days, in front of starters.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MarcB247 @thehill Answer.  Biden has said he would roll back President Trump's 2017 tax cuts for people making over $400,000, meaning the top individual income tax rate would increase from 37 percent to 39.6 percent.  400k a year puts you in the top 2%.

<|startoftext|>@BigWillie7179 @Bengals @Ravens Jim Turner and Zac Taylor are arrogant and delusional. They thought the OL was better and repetitively said the talent and solution was in he building. game 21 under this staff...and zero notable wins.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LndsPatterson arrogance and delusion that this OL was better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ben_Baby Does he want to live in a world of sunshine and marshmallows? You‚Äôre reporting on a dumpster fire of a team? Hard to pick out the positives... ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bengals They'll never spend on FA again, they're all hurt. The excuse for coaching will be injuries...again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bengals looks like like an injury in pride and his effort is questionable/doubtful. this sucks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jake_NFL has Burrow been hit on literally every play?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BMeek23 @vancemeek Fair, but that wasn't your argument and Bengals are currently picking 13.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BMeek23 @vancemeek and right now we have a QB who is playing pretty well as a rookie...and no good WRs who can make a play/gain separation. If we had some speed in WR, defenses would actually respect the position.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The Burrow hype is over for me @Bengals. This coaching staff and their decision making is trash. Don‚Äôt know how to use anyone on the roster. AJ is giving up on plays.

<|startoftext|>@biscuits378 @LndsPatterson Potentially, but guard and tackle are different positions/skill sets. One of the reason Fred Johnson failed at guard is because he‚Äôs built more like a tackle. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FFMike_ @SportsCenter OL is bad, but an injury riddled Jags defense also helps. No CBs or LBs. A win is a win, but only by a TD?  3 wins under ZT to very bad teams.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ben_Baby So even he admitted Cincy is scraping the bottom of the barrel?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BengalsProblems Staff were smart for once not extending a player. He‚Äôs got 12 more weeks to prove them wrong, but preseason is over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dutcher_11 @vancemeek ‚ÄúStar‚Äù players were all out too. We have to get a win against a decent team that isn‚Äôt riddled with injuries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chiefkeith92 @Bengals A break from losing is nice, but a lot of these loses are inexcusable. That‚Äôs all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bengals Let‚Äôs get one against an average team not riddled with injuries now. ZT is still questionable.<|endoftext|>

Gio or Ross could do it.   I‚Äôd like to see Ross over Erickson for the speed alone. Whether he gets his number called or not, he can take a defender away and stretch the field.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DarthNoobSaibot @Dave__Mosher @JoeGoodberry That was more towards Dave mentioning FJ at guard, but he‚Äôs built to be a tackle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@muners201 @Jake_NFL @JamesRapien  https://t.co/UN2UwhUzoM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarthNoobSaibot @Dave__Mosher @JoeGoodberry Guard and tackle are two very different positions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarthNoobSaibot @JoeGoodberry @Odinbn Wasn‚Äôt the defenders arm on one of Higgin‚Äôs? DB wrenched his other arm away when he was trying to apply pressure to complete the catch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jake_NFL maybe that actually means the seat is warm behind the scenes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jake_NFL @JamesRapien holy shit...he says that the right guard position has been a revolving door next to Hart? What has Hart been? ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bengals @bengaljims_BTR "Bobby Hart hasn't had a right guard next to him...it's been a revolving door there". Are you describing Bobby?  https://t.co/q42A4gFWoy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JamesRapien I think the fact that we all saw this coming and you guys are reporting realistic solutions just means nothing will happen.  They ignored it last year, they ignored it in the offseason. The coaching staff is complacent.  - Signed, a pessimistic Bengals fan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BengalsCaptain I‚Äôve been conditioned for decades. That‚Äôs all.  https://t.co/sbLWPfPIJj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeGoodberry @Polasek609 @GolferMatt23 Yet none of that happened. And unlikely either player or coach knew Huggins went out of bounds. Higgins didn‚Äôt even know.

<|startoftext|>@vancemeek @StempleZachary What specifically with Burrow? The pick? Anyone could have done that after watching our QB situation.  Developing Burrow? He showed up with insane worth ethic and drive. A loaded gun. ZT did nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill He‚Äôs been ‚Äúunder audit‚Äù for half a decade... #TrumpTaxReturns<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoeGoodberry  https://t.co/JzS2lbhPjn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OhioSC7 @KyJustified @Ben_Baby They signed a backup quality player in XSF and kept touting confidence in Hart?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ben_Baby Should have ‚Äúfigured it out‚Äù in the off season. Instead they touted how confident they were in backup wishy players. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è #SeizeTheDEY  https://t.co/tdFNcMRMSF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeGoodberry and not signing backup quality players.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BengalsCaptain @IOnHealthJoe @tbabyswaglord @nattyboh Haha...man, it all hurt.  I‚Äôm seeing individual player improvements, which is good...but I‚Äôm questioning the staff more when we can‚Äôt close out. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IOnHealthJoe @BengalsCaptain @tbabyswaglord @nattyboh Defense can‚Äôt make a stop under pressure.  Wentz rushed for more than Mixon.  Eagles had next to no passing attack, that‚Äôs easy to stop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BengalsCaptain @tbabyswaglord @nattyboh It was bad last year. They‚Äôve done next to nothing to improve the oline...  Prayed Jonah would just fix it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BengalsCaptain @tbabyswaglord @nattyboh I think the honeymoon phase is over for the coaching staff. They have more talent, brought talent in, aren‚Äôt dealing with injuries and they still can‚Äôt put it together.  JB can‚Äôt do it on his own. This defense is soft.  Idk how to feel right now...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllBengals @JamesRapien ZT‚Äôs seat getting warmer. Coaching seemingly gave up today. ZT, yelled at JB to throw a ball out of bounds which ended up resulting in a completion to Higgins, negated by a penalty.  He winks at ZT afterwards. We have a QB, but do we have a staff who knows how to use the talent?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BengalsCaptain @tbabyswaglord @nattyboh They ignored it in the offseason ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeGoodberry We have a QB, but he can‚Äôt do it himself.  WR need to find some separation or the play calling needs to scheme them open.  Oline is so bad Bobby Hart isn‚Äôt as glaring.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jake_NFL I listen every morning regardless. Wonder what the listener fallback might be... üòë<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeoffHobsonCin You didn‚Äôt.  You don‚Äôt know how to win. You gave up. #FireZacTaylor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigWillie7179 I‚Äôd expect an attempt of some sort. Not a fair catch and a draw play. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  https://t.co/Y0gdPH0BSd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BengalsMarisa Bengals ended it with a draw play when we could have passed it twice ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  The coaching staff rolling over and gave up...what‚Äôs that show the players?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Logi513 @Bengals This is the definition of insanity and ZT is in over his head. Trusting this coaching staff shows who he is.  If the entire staff is intact come tomorrow ZT shouldn‚Äôt have a job any longer.  It‚Äôs already started, I‚Äôm sorry but #fireZacTaylor<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hey @Bengals, correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but you play to win right? Not to tie?  Coaching staff gives up...runs a draw play to tie? How defeating is that?

<|startoftext|>@JamesRapien If he plays Thursday, I truly believe he faked the injury to cover up a complete botch.  I would of had Burrow throw to the end zone 2 more times for the win anyway. A made FG to OT is a win for the Chargers defense to me...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@vancemeek What‚Äôs the hypothetical trade?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BengalsCaptain Yes, Keeping Green is huge, but retaining their own isn‚Äôt enough. It‚Äôs shown. A 2-14 team has made no moves to get better when they have the money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jake_NFL From this moment on, I will expect nothing more, no improvement...until Mike Brown gone and out the door.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BengalsCaptain I feel like they‚Äôre always ‚Äútrying aggressively‚Äù though. It‚Äôs always not enough. What‚Äôs the last big name FA they‚Äôve gotten? They‚Äôre losing me.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ChrisN53486 @HibachiBlogger @GetUpESPN @danorlovsky7 No one's a sure thing.  Which is why Tua isn't in the conversation.  He broke his hip.  He probably won't be at the combine. If Tua were healthy it's a completely different convo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HibachiBlogger @ChrisN53486 @GetUpESPN @danorlovsky7 Trading out is just prolonging the rebuild when they already have some pieces in place and a 1st round tackle in Jonah returning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HibachiBlogger @ChrisN53486 @GetUpESPN @danorlovsky7 Also, future 1st draft picks don't mean much.  They'll just be compensation to move up to eventually get a QB. If Cincy stayed healthy and won just 2 more of the potential games they could have...this wouldn't even be a convo. FA and next years draft can fix other holes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tstockelman @Young_Yolaaaa @PickleRickk13 @JoeGoodberry Agreed, we won‚Äôt know how it falls until FA, combine, and when it comes to the actual draft. They have the money to pay for a FA lb and we essentially have another 1st rounder coming back in Jonah.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Young_Yolaaaa @tstockelman @PickleRickk13 @JoeGoodberry If there‚Äôs a guy there, definitely. We need some speed with Ross being a roller coaster. Waiting for the combine to speculated round 2 since LBs can easily creep up in the combine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jake_NFL All this does is prolong a rebuild? Right? We have some pieces and failed offload them already...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vancemeek @JoeGoodberry @Jake_NFL 1st round picks over 4 years don‚Äôt do it for me. Especially with the likelihood those are late 1st rounders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vancemeek @JoeGoodberry @Jake_NFL Cam‚Äôs what, 30? We‚Äôll continue to be in purgatory or we‚Äôll need to use all that capitol to trade up and get a QB in a couple years anyway. It‚Äôs just prolonging the rebuild. Start now with burrow while we have some good offensive peices already in place and the chance to tag AJ.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Young_Yolaaaa @tstockelman @PickleRickk13 @JoeGoodberry Yup. Exactly. I think a franchise tag and a good season would lead to a 2-3 year extension and him retiring as a bengal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tstockelman @Young_Yolaaaa @PickleRickk13 @JoeGoodberry Yup.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Young_Yolaaaa @tstockelman @PickleRickk13 @JoeGoodberry Imagine a 17-18 year old joe burrow in Athens Ohio watching a 2nd and 3rd year AJ green lighting up defenses while thinking ‚Äúman, I want to be chucking TDS to that guy.‚Äù He can do it now.  https://t.co/NtkKcMxzBW<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@vancemeek Ya I figured as much. Idk...watching some of the throws burrow has made has me sold even so. Give me the combine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vancemeek I‚Äôll take Burrow‚Äôs competitiveness and leadership he‚Äôs shown against the SEC. plus cincy likely won‚Äôt be in the situation to get Fields or Lawrence next year anyway.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Solomethod @vancemeek I haven‚Äôt given up on him. But we could of gotten him later and a more impactful play maker in the second round. It was the coaching staffs first draft, but MB still calls the shots. So we‚Äôll see how 2020 goes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BengalsCaptain @duckornoduck Hopefully. We need everyone to succeed and silence the doubters. Uphill battle being a second round pick when he was rated what? 5th round?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@duckornoduck @BengalsCaptain Don‚Äôt get me wrong...I love Tate. The Sample pick was just bad timing.  That being said, hope they resign Eifert after a healthy season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BengalsCaptain DK Metcalf could of been our DK Mercalf. Instead we over valued an injured blocking TE who can‚Äôt block and didn‚Äôt see much of the field. üòë<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NFL_Memes Meme fail. Stayed healthy all season. Send in the Clown(ney) on an illegal hit that the blind @NFLOfficiating allowed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vancemeek Can he block like our 2nd round TE!? Wait...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JordanUhl  https://t.co/ydydXR7a6q<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ohiopreplegends No shit, but SEC refs were in charge of this game.   Regardless, score 3 times in the redzone with that offense instead of kicking it and you‚Äôre looking at 27pts going into half. Hardly a game at that point. Don‚Äôt let Clemson go 98yards in what...4 plays?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NFL @Joe_MainMixon @TooLoose26 @_lococinco What is this? #NFL actually acknowledging talent on the bengals? Let alone @Joe_MainMixon?! Remember when you snubbed him for the ground player of the week? #SeizeTheDEY<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoeGoodberry I‚Äôm so sick of seeing underthrown balls to Ross though. Last time he caught one in stride?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JakeSirkus @JoeGoodberry Shaun was a step behind from making a play. A ‚Äúno body‚Äù wr made a move and Webb was stunned 4 yards away. He had bad coverage imo.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jake_NFL  https://t.co/NijGJuMTJU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeEller8 @Ben_Baby Then it‚Äôs a good thing there‚Äôs NFL all over an NFL team‚Äôs roster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeEller8 @Ben_Baby And he was until he hit 30. Your point? Apparently there is no step one to fixing this team then.  Burrow‚Äôs college career and dalton‚Äôs college career aren‚Äôt even comparable.  https://t.co/QbQhfsDMY7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeEller8 @Ben_Baby Maybe so, but then why even try?  Difference is, Burrow has shown he can create and be mobile in the pocket, Dalton is shook with pressure at the point in his career.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeGoodberry Maybe he‚Äôll be happy when he hears Burrow to Boyd for 6 for the duration of his contract in some meaningful games and not garbage time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ben_Baby At the trade deadline Andy wanted out. Was mad his agent didn‚Äôt have enough time to make a trade. He‚Äôll have plenty of time to find a trade partner come draft season. #SeizeTheDEY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ben_Baby He‚Äôll be happy when we hear Burrow to Boyd for 6 for the duration of his extension. Andy ain‚Äôt it for a 3rd contract. Fans don‚Äôt want pointless wins...shortsighted. #SeizeTheDEY<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JamesRapien More accurate.  https://t.co/CWM4S0hd4w<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CraigMergenthal @vancemeek Because the Texans won so many games with a healthy JJ Watt. And because CY declared for the draft. (Even though I think he will)  These fans also don‚Äôt realize this is likely the last QB we can potentially get under the current CBA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NFL @andydalton14 They can‚Äôt even lose correctly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scoring twice to tie up and a 2pt conversion is the most Bengals thing ever...to potentially screw them out of a much needed and potentially franchise QB. WHAT ARE YOU DOING!? #SeizeTheDEY<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jake_NFL @TheAthleticCIN @MoEgger1530 I still wouldn‚Äôt take it. Unless we‚Äôre getting multiple 1st round picks in a single draft like Miami managed. We know the bengals have no plan especially in the long term.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bengals Yes....everything you said...except next year when those wins actually matter. Secure Burrow with the no. 1 pick. Cut the fat. Use the money in FA to sign a RT, MLB, etc... #SeizeTheDEY<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NickKendellMHH @PFF_Mike @j_train33 @Bengals You fix or at least upgrade the OL in free agency by cutting dead aging weight like Dre, Dalton, Hart, etc. Have to take advantage of rookie QB contracts in the league these days.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DrunkBengalsfan Wanted this yesterday...instead we got Finley‚Äôs noodle arm throwing marshmallows for all 4 quarters üòë<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeGoodberry @DjRodgers1231 And zero accountability.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_JustinFischer_ @GermainePratt7 @WhoDey311 1. You‚Äôre* 2. He didn‚Äôt get starts until mid season as a rookie. 3. If you actually watch and know football the dude‚Äôs got potential. Vice like grip on those tackles in the midfield. 4. It‚Äôs likely he‚Äôll be the only LB still on the team next year because of that potential<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeGoodberry @DjRodgers1231 If that were the case, they would of traded Dalton...for anything. You really think they want to pay a guy to sit the bench. Not with mike brown‚Äôs cheap ass running the show. The long term plan is to make it up as they go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigWillie7179 @lockedonbengals @Ryan_sovah_Yunt Whelp... looking forward to it Willie and @Jake_NFL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeGoodberry probably more accurate... ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  https://t.co/ptXGx7rot4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pauldehnerjr  https://t.co/mCZcIMZQyU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeGoodberry Exactly. If they manage to scrape 2-3 wins...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Update: This franchise is still a joke with no captain running the ship. If you wanted to win, could have done that against the #Steelers yesterday. The most Bengals thing to do right now is win a few garbage games and ruin a potential top 3 pick. #BungleforBurrow #SeizeTheDEY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeoffHobsonCin SHOULD have done that yesterday then. The ship has no captain and you're also looking to screw us in the draft.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeGoodberry Could have used that yesterday if they were looking for a jolt. This ship has no captain and we will screw ourselves in the draft now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BengalsMarisa Probably should have done that against the Steelers @Bengals. This is how you ruin the potential of a top draft pick.  Wow....who TF is running this franchise?  Who is in charge?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jake_NFL Webb and his best Dre impression.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesRapien  https://t.co/PpVsq8qT9l<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigWillie7179 yes big willie!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrunkBengalsfan And then you risk trading away this and next years draft and screw yourselves like the bears did with trubisky.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeGoodberry It‚Äôs very similar to SW Dark Forces. When he was fighting those stormtroopers....so good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesRapien I‚Äôm STILL blown away Mason got next to nothing for any of his retaliation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeGoodberry Come on...did she think this was a marvel movie or something!? Ha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeGoodberry If there‚Äôs little to no chance of re-injury and reps are worth it. Need to see him against actual nfl players.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeGoodberry I see hope. The tiniest little bit this team gets it together in the off season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BengalsCaptain Typical Steelers denial. Tomlin‚Äôs ignorance and lack of accountability. They‚Äôre coached this way. Common denominator thugs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BengalsMarisa  https://t.co/tXHXGCaulQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeGoodberry @lockedonbengals Apparently the lockedon steelers guys are just as bad, ignorant, and clueless and typical steelers fans.  Tank is off this week. Fuck the Steelers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MelonieMac Hands down RE2. New life into the franchise just like God of War did last year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvilAndyDalton I mean...ideally. If we‚Äôre going to win 1 I hope this is it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pauldehnerjr Finley doesn‚Äôt have the velocity to make that throw to Boyd. Awful timing. Easier to float it up into double coverage to an UDFA (for him).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@qz ü§î Favored not because they are prejudice, but because they are prejudice? Got it. Excellent headline.  prej¬∑u¬∑dice noun 1. preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jake_NFL  https://t.co/fcWGgiV1F7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chadwag87516097 @JoeGoodberry And who‚Äôs the best player? Truth is, we have no idea how any of these players are going to turn out. Building only through the draft is not today‚Äôs nfl and a QB is the teams top need if they‚Äôre picking this high/if he‚Äôs their guy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chadwag87516097 @JoeGoodberry Do you think half the team will be as injured as they are for a second year in a row? Jonah should upgrade the OL.  These problems can't be fixed just in the draft alone.  They have to reach into their 100mil cap space pockets and sign guys to fill the gaps at defense and OL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chadwag87516097 @JoeGoodberry Agreed, but a different situation.  Bears traded a lot away to go up and get their QB.  If the front office believes in the guy at 1 or 2, we use the pick.  Low chance we'll be picking 1 or 2 again next year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeGoodberry @Jake_NFL thoughts on Eifert?  We know what he's capable of.  The play calling hasn't really used TEs until recently with all our WRs going down. Do we resign him for another year? A couple years for cheap?  Let him walk?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeGoodberry @chadwag87516097 QB is objectively the most important position in football.  This isn't even debatable.  We don't have a serviceable one next year and for the future.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MelonieMac @joekuli6 We watching the same thing? Pounded him to the ground? He wrapped him up right when the ball was thrown and mason landed on top of him. He instigated it and Garrett lost his shit after that. And he‚Äôll be suspended for it.  https://t.co/DMaYCFDiNe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MelonieMac @joekuli6 I‚Äôm not defending Myles but Mason isn‚Äôt some innocent lamb. Steelers players have been taking cheap shots for years. Everyone who threw a punch should be fined, suspended, etc.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@stepoffgeorge @KevDigs @JamesRapien Did you even see the full video? Myles tackled him, Mason tried ripping his helmet off on the ground in frustration, the Myles took off masons. Mason then goes after garret and he lost his shit from there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MelonieMac @joekuli6 Had him legally wrapped up and tackled him. Didn‚Äôt land on him which would be considered roughing. Not one person mentioned a possible roughing. Mason tried ripping his helmet off in frustration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TwinPeaksDudes YADDLE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesRapien He also instigated the whole thing trying to go at Myles first too.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bengals_action No, I‚Äôm using it as an example about how they can tank and actually have a plan for 2020. To take young this year and top tier qb next. Adding Young alone isn‚Äôt going to get this team to .500, but so hard to pass up with our aging defense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bengals_action We haven‚Äôt had a 1st round pick play his rookie season in forever because of injury. The injury report has been atrocious nearly every week for years. 2015 was an outlier because they did stay healthy. The team hasn‚Äôt changed much since then and are 4 years older.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bengals_action Plus, odds are we are injured. We always are, look at the last 3 years.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GeoffHobsonCin Ya, they COULD. If the coaching staff actually used their RBs, speedy WR correctly. Or just schemed a player to be open. Talent‚Äôs there. You put them on the bears, chiefs, rams...and they‚Äôd all be studs. #SeizeTheDEY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Beezzzzy @bitwitkyle Swapped out mobo and psu along with some janky ‚Äúmods‚Äù. At that point could of just swapped out the case, since mobo was out already, to something like the phanteks p300 TG for $50 and actually had a good pc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also:  https://t.co/LdXs7NfxCw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‚ÄúThere was an idea, to bring together a group of remarkable people, to see if we could become something more.‚Äù  https://t.co/OxIPHpjcNb #Marvel #AvengersEndGame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is basically my parents.  https://t.co/lQ7EspVlH7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeGoodberry Let‚Äôs get Marvin and Mike added too. I‚Äôd like to punch them both in the throat. #fatality<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Allowing people to continue to pay AFTER the announcement was made that no blue line trains were running at Monroe station. Good job @cta . The biggest @CTAFails. #Chicago<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‚ÄúJosina Anderson on NFL Live: spoke with #Bengals source who believes #MarvinLewis will take week or two after season to decide his future and in "their opinion" he will choose to move on. @fox19‚Äù  https://t.co/9Zbav1oDNw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesRapien Oh man...now I get to feel Bengals pain AND cavs pain. Yay Ohio sports.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mike_long_  https://t.co/fF3DAi84Lk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NFL_Memes @mike_long_ @CRob1613 @yaboywellso thoughts? I‚Äôd say Rodgers fires him in a week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScienceStudioYT No way in hell I‚Äôd mention the 2018 model or older to anyone based on styling alone haha. Good luck with the search dude.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScienceStudioYT For sure it‚Äôs not for everyone. I think they finally put it on their site today so it popped into my head when you mentioned the FJ. New one looks like like the Tacoma, 4Runner and Cherokee has a baby.  https://t.co/MzHiRV6WLq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScienceStudioYT Or go all in...TRD 4 Runner ha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScienceStudioYT AWD 203 hp. Yes a 4 cylinder, but torque vectoring and 3700lb towing capacity...and way better gas mileage. Not going to argue because yes, it might not fit what you currently need it for, but yes, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs the replacement considering the msrp and discontinued FJ.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScienceStudioYT Fair, but it seems like this model/trim has replaced the markestshare Toyota had when they discontinued the FJ. Only reason I mentioned it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScienceStudioYT Check out the new Rav4 Adventure trim Toyota released today. Proven reliability with those models.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeGoodberry The blueprints are there. You put Gio, Mixon, and Boyd in Chicago or on the Rams and they‚Äôd be absolute studs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeGoodberry Because they don‚Äôt use anyone correctly. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeGoodberry The thing that gets me is that Marvin doesn‚Äôt accept blame for it. He just says ‚Äúyoung guys‚Äù ‚Äúdo your job‚Äù. Like...no ‚Äúcoach‚Äù...it‚Äôs a direct representation of the coaches in charge and being completely undisciplined. Do YOUR job. Ugh. #FireMarvin #SeizeTheDEY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is basically preseason football now @Bengals. #SeizeTheDey #DENvsCIN  https://t.co/aLX58z31hj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haskins. #HeismanTrophy. Those numbers are ridiculous. #GoBucks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesRapien Nope. They needed a no.1 WR so they went out and got it. A team that actually wants to win. Just sounds like they #SeizeTheDey? Ha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilBreen @musicboxtheatre The theater was ELECTRIC all night!<|endoftext|>
