<|startoftext|>What happened here!?!? 😂 @DeadByBHVR I ended up feeling forced to dc to let the game resume. Is this one of your antics Dwelf? 🧐🥴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LANDONCIDER @Marek_Richard I know what I want for Christmas 😎🥸 also me rn  https://t.co/b22jl2strc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LANDONCIDER Those glasses are everything!!! Love your look! Love everything 🥰 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slipsongs @doctavaughn @Whatapityonyou @Jehane94 But on that note it’s been real. For anyone reading this you do you. I don’t care. 🥴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QuatroQuatro20 @Whatapityonyou @Jehane94 You got me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doctavaughn @slipsongs @Whatapityonyou @Jehane94 Didn’t get mad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mountboom @Whatapityonyou @Jehane94 Yup that’s why I said cool. I’m not internet illiterate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slipsongs @doctavaughn @Whatapityonyou @Jehane94 I want the most progressive agenda out there, I really do, but I’m also a realist. Maybe that’s my downfall as a progressive, but I just don’t believe in forcing what I want onto others. I’d rather work with others and win them over or be able to get the best solution. 4/?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slipsongs @doctavaughn @Whatapityonyou @Jehane94 In my opinion she doesn’t have a lot of options as it’s either to get relief now and buy as much time until Biden get in the WH or nothing. I’d much rather have something, and tbh I don’t expect to get my entire wishlist when I know 70+ million disagree with me. 3/?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slipsongs @doctavaughn @Whatapityonyou @Jehane94 From my opinion, people seem to expect her to do the impossible or to break norms just as the GOP/Trump has done which I don’t believe is the best. She has to work with the Senate controlled by McConnell who is self claimed the Grim Reaper. 2/?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slipsongs @doctavaughn @Whatapityonyou @Jehane94 It was fun at first and gave me a few laughs by the reactions I was getting. 🤷‍♂️but seriously I don’t think she’s done anything to be forced to retire. She had the most experience at the time she was elected by her colleagues to be speaker. 1/?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slipsongs @doctavaughn @Whatapityonyou @Jehane94 Are we having this conversation in good faith? Or is this an attempt to waste my time? Because I honestly don’t care too much about this, nor do I love Pelosi to have a twitter feud over something so silly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doctavaughn @slipsongs @Whatapityonyou @Jehane94 Interesting, how you deduced all of that from just the one tweet. Have you thought about becoming a therapist? But we can be done because no matter what my explanation is you’ve made it clear you made up your mind. 🥰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mountboom @Whatapityonyou @Jehane94 Cool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doctavaughn @slipsongs @Whatapityonyou @Jehane94 Better watch out stamp out all opposing views just like the MAGA crowd does. 🥰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doctavaughn @slipsongs @Whatapityonyou @Jehane94 Show me where I fawned over Pelosi. I’ll wait. I just don’t think the OP is right in what she said. How dare I have an opposing view.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Whatapityonyou @slipsongs @Jehane94 Don’t know how I’m grasping at straws, but you do you to make yourself feel better. Just like the MAGA crowd. Funny thing is we could get more done if we worked together instead of this. But here we are. Have a good day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Whatapityonyou @Jehane94 You’re welcome Karen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slipsongs @Whatapityonyou @Jehane94 I don’t care how many people are saying this. You all act like you know everything and make you no better than the MAGA crowd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jehane94 @Whatapityonyou No.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Whatapityonyou @Jehane94 Wow you’re so cool, such a woke person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MandaJay It’s so true<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t need this just really want it 🤪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rey_Sin_ @DeadByBHVR Haha thanks 😘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @DeadByBHVR wanted to share my match with a hacker. I reported them in game but also wanted to make you aware with a tweet.  https://t.co/cw6ebCqRZN<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The GOP doesn’t want anyone with a different view then theirs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Start with the White House first then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kyleejordyn_ Also I oppose abortion because if we kill babies before they are born and they’re gaybies (gay babies) then we lose the opportunity to make fun of them. 🤪<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Space_Rodent @PhantasyPhiend @ggreenwald ...free speech applies to governments, not private companies. And don’t @ me because there is nothing else to say. People don’t understand free speech.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HamiltonMcgrath @thehill @TheNAJournal 😂😂😂 says the creator of said journal and has partisan written all over his posts on twitter. What a good joke for my morning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Latino4Peace Ya I’m not trying to persuade you, especially since you seem to have selective memory. Thanks for trying though. Good quote from RBG though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Latino4Peace @thehill Thanks for your concern but I don’t need your empty words.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Latino4Peace @thehill 😂😂😂 ok again we WON’T forget this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@buddytwogun @thehill We haven’t forgotten how Merrick Garland didn’t even receive a hearing. You suck it up because here soon we’ll have a President Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Latino4Peace @thehill It seems the senate republicans forgot to do their job and allow Merrick Garland a hearing when Obama appointed him. Interesting how you have selective memory.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomDickHarryyy @thehill As much of a threat as the daily bullshit that comes out of Trump’s mouth or on his Twitter. 😉 Oh and don’t talk about rule breaking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ernest_kalaba @thehill As much of a threat as the daily bullshit that comes out of Trump’s mouth or on his Twitter. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Madison7735 @thehill As if Trump doesn’t 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kmorgan24 @thehill @JoeBiden Because she was confirmed even closer to an election than when Obama appointed Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court. Garland however, never even received a hearing. Additionally, Trump lost the popular vote close to 3 million of the votes. So no, we won’t forget this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill A little too late.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AhReAnimate We need to remember this. Especially since such an incompetent president was able to appoint THREE LIFETIME positions. So much wrong with this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How can we expect the president to handle tough decisions if he cannot handle tough questions. #vote #BidenHarris2020 #FireTheLiar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dbbeagles @thehill @GayleKing @CBSNews The feeling is mutual.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BubbaLouis @thehill Oh look another white man here with an opinion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ODell_Nathaniel  https://t.co/1pJHUbI8lI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We all realize that when Trump tries to claim someone has multiple houses, we do realize all of the personal properties, private jets, etc Trump owns right? #Debates2020 #TrumpChinaBankAccount<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Show us your tax returns, we’re not stupid. #Debates2020 #vote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“Release your tax returns or stop talking about corruption.” @JoeBiden  #Debates2020 #DebateTonight #vote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I get it now, Trump supporters have selective hearing. Trump contradicts himself in the same sentence but they only hear what they want to hear. All so they can continue their hatred for Democrats, liberals, or anyone who doesn’t share their views.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the fog happened here @DeadByBHVR 🧐 Also got a DC penalty for it...But it’s ok I still love you 😘  https://t.co/ZvRD3NTKrZ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tmarieBisMe @thehill Oh you don’t have anything to say to that? Typical.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tmarieBisMe @thehill If you’re truly concerned maybe let’s take a look at the Trump kids, one who is currently in the White House and two in charge of the father’s businesses while he is President. Businesses President Trump wouldn’t divest from. So try again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tmarieBisMe @thehill Because Hunter Biden is not running for President. That would be my guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Truly a disturbing man.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Again I’m truly disappointed in our current VP, my former governor. Truly an arrogant man. Someone who believes he can speak over women and show no respect to anyone other than kissing Trump’s ass. #VPDebate #vpdebatetakes #VPdebates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How unprofessional that time and time again Trump and Pence break their agreement to the rules. If they cannot respect their agreement to mere debate rules, how can the American people trust the Trump/Pence administration RESPECT anyone or anything. #VPDebate #VPdebates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every time Trump and Pence dodge a question reaffirms they cannot be trusted to be honest with the American people. #VPDebates #PenceHarrisDebate #VPdebates2020 #AmericaNeedsJoe #VicePresidentialDebate2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does the Trump/Pence Administration not understand the rules on not interrupting, sticking to the time limit, and answering the questions? #VPDebate #VPDebate2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m so done that we cannot stay on topic. And by we I mean the arrogant GOP leadership. This is disrespectful and playing games. #VPDebate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aband0n_allh0p3 Cute! We need to visit each other’s islands ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t support wasting our time an energy complaining and criticizing Biden, especially over a debate. We can do that when he’s president. Right now Donald Trump is president and he’s failing, that’s where the criticism lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill The damage has already been done. Also he didn’t misspeak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeghaTweetsHere If your pride is worth more than getting someone literally ruining our country, then go right ahead. I’m a progressive, and I will be voting for Joe Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I DENOUNCE WHITE SUPREMACY AND THE KKK.  {*this is not difficult to admit}<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ltsEcho @DeadByBHVR Seriously that’s what happened to me. I didn’t even have time to dead hard because they would just swing immediately after the blink and it was essentially a guaranteed hit. Such bs and how they played made the match a joke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ltsEcho @DeadByBHVR I was noticing 20 ft hits against a nurse last night. All she had to do was blink and then swing and it hit me. Just like your video.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theecomrade @alec____hansen I suppose your pride will mean the world to you if Trump is re-elected and he continues to do more damage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Super_Nintenduh @JoeBiden What a sucker we are if we re-elect a white supremacist who pays more taxes to other countries than his own. Take your nonsense elsewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KolperMick @JoeBiden Cool I don’t care what you think. 😘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DV_1069 @JoeBiden You hear want you want to hear. You either get Trump, or someone that will align with you more than Trump. But you do you. If you’re not here for support you can kindly take your opinion to your own tweets. 😘 #JoeBidenKamalaHarris2020 #PresidentBiden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotSoSilentMajo @thatonequeen It was totally a call to arms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let’s send a loud and clear message to President Trump who the country supports. If you can contribute, no matter how much or little, it will make a difference.

<|startoftext|>Made a $200 donation to @JoeBiden I believe we can create a better future together. I believe in competent leadership and willing to listen to expertise will happen with a President Biden. #PresidentialDebate #Debate2020 #shutupman #BidenHarris2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump could put all of this to rest by releasing his taxes. I wonder why he still hasn’t? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bendonaldson33 @thehill Ok buddy, keep your thumbs going then. I don’t really care what you think or believe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If he’s skeptical we wouldn’t have an “honest” election #MoscowMitch could’ve brought the election security bills to the senate floor to address this issue, but instead they would rather have chaos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bendonaldson33 @thehill I’m not accepting your “alternative facts.” But keep living your fantasy. But if it helps your fragile ego, I’ll continue living in my fantasy. ✌🏻 Now shut up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bendonaldson33 @thehill Because you responded to me even after I told you to shut up. Seems to me you want a debate, yet here we are and your replies keep coming. Stop messaging me at this point and live your fantasy my man. You only have until January 2021<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bendonaldson33 @thehill Debating with you is fruitless. Just like Trump you’ll play mental gymnastics as to what he “really said/meant.” Continue living in your fantasy though. ✌🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bendonaldson33 @thehill There’s a difference between people not accepting the results vs the actual president. How stupid are you? Really, I’m curious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bendonaldson33 @thehill All of the truth, yet you’ve said nothing truthful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FaxKeIIerman @thehill Shut up it’s by his own family member.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bendonaldson33 @thehill Shut up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@az_reason @thehill Rhetoric like this will get the result you’re looking for. Stop trying to set fires in your own country. It’s truly disgraceful just like your president.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love how another sitting senator (no less a GOP senator) staring that the Democratic Party is orchestrating violent protests with no facts to back up his baseless claim. I see he has no problem with the fires Trump sets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Barbara24218684 @mchmiel @DThomsson84 @thehill The only thing anti-American is comments such as yours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bsbarkies @thehill That’s exactly what it is. But the GOP will frame it as the Dems are playing politics and we’re not.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CommDigiNews @Right_NotLeft @SpeakerPelosi Imagine having a president that actually assists governors instead of making everything worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He disrespects Americans everyday.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LukasGoatt @thehill 😂😂😂 what are we school children? But that’s besides the point. Maybe, just maybe Trump’s atrocious behavior is finally catching up to him. But keep telling yourself whatever helps you sleep comfortably at night. 😘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ped1589 @thehill Delete your account.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chris36635055 @thehill Wouldn’t you like that to be true.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We’ve already heard him publicly disrespect McCain and the Khan family. Try again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Food for thought here  https://t.co/jC8hn03LHb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A real patriot, someone who wants to lead the entire nation and not just their supporters. The president isn’t the end all be all, they embody who we want to be as a nation.

<|startoftext|>@lindyli You’re just as bad as Trump for suggesting something with no evidence. Bernie wouldn’t support that, as he made clear tonight. I don’t support that behavior as a Bernie supporter.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MeghanMcCain No other candidate has such nasty followers? None? You can’t think of one? One that ridiculed your amazing father and demonstrates his behavior to be “perfect?” I want to like you but you say some nonsensical stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Jordan Except life you don’t agree with. It’s easier to protect life that doesn’t say things you dislike. You’re a joke.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RogerDo65800972 @BluHydrangea_ I’m so sorry you’re having to deal with a deplorable American. Ignore the haters and enjoy in your amazing day! 😘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorBraun you’re a disgrace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_H_D_ Ya that’ll help bring the country together. Calling people stupid. Also I’m not sure how her ideas or dangerous. But yes let’s continue using fear mongering and talking in absolutes. That isn’t an incredibly dangerous “debate” tactic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_H_D_ I mean other than word choice, I wouldn’t say telling people they’re wrong I should say that it is disrespectful. I’m disappointed in your approach of sharing your opinion on this matter. But just my opinion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting the GOP senators aren’t angry about POTUS being corrupt and participating in criminal behavior, they’re angry they weren’t kept in the loop. Got it. #GOPCoverup #GOPTraitors<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorBraun @SenJohnBarrasso Tune in for what? Your cover up?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorBraun Please stop acting as if you do not need to do the job you were elected to do. Witnesses must be called to have a trial, by preventing witnesses you’re not having a trial, but a cover up. John Bolton should testify and said he would be willing to if subpoenaed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@C_H_D_ How anyone can think anyone has an answer to anything? 😉 Every idea is going to take cooperation from all sides/parties. But rent prices are out of control. There’s no reason why we have a homeless problem in the United States.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MandaJay @Wingman208<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MandaJay @Wingman208<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_H_D_ I’m open to suggestions our health care system is broken and it needs fixed. People are dying now so I think it would be on our country’s best interest to do better. We are the richest country on the planet, we should be able to solve this issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_H_D_ There’s waiting lists now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would like for our government to operate with standard checks and balances. I would like to stop making every issue so polarizing and urging us to “take sides” and declaring who’s more of a patriot. Call me un-American if you want, but this is my opinion.  I love America 🇺🇸 5/5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not only that but Trump’s administration hasn’t given good enough reasoning for this action.   I would like to not lose any more American and innocent civilians lives. I would like to start investing in our country and our people not war and killing people. 4/5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have spent countless money, resources, American lives, etc for almost two decades in the Middle East with no end in sight. I believe our President has too broad of authority to be killing people in other countries without Congressional approval. This include Obama and Bush.3/5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My reason is I don’t think we should keep killing other countries citizens (even if they’re an evil person) without ensuring the cost/benefit ratio. Additionally the Middle East has been an awful quagmire for our country. 2/5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just want to make one thing clear, just because someone is criticizing Trump’s decision to kill Soleimani doesn’t mean they love/support terrorists. There could be a variety of reasons why they’re apprehensive of his killing. 1/5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_H_D_ We have GOP leadership refusing to even work with the Democrats. We can’t find solutions the majority of us will support when one party is embracing propaganda and protecting an out of control President.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_H_D_ We always seem to have money for war, but not actually investing in our country. What’s up with that? Why is that ok, while it’s actually happening but oh no AOC introduced the GND and it’s just the worst thing on the planet. We are facing problems that will need solutions. 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_H_D_ I think it extends well beyond the White House. And while I agree there are well intentioned policies that may not be as helpful as intentioned it doesn’t help when one party refuses to work together as Americans. Which in turn could actually be a win win for society.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_H_D_ I never thought that one side could be less hateful than the other. To be perfectly honest though I care less about the every day person and more so the leadership that represents them in our government. Making hateful policies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_H_D_ All sides can be hateful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_H_D_ Well you do you. Vote your beliefs then. I figured you moved to the right based on your posts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_H_D_ Also I want to add, I regret how much I posted my dislike of Hillary in 2016 (since I ended up voting for her) and some of my posts were not always about the campaign/issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_H_D_ I don’t understand why you dislike Bernie so much. He might be the nominee, and literally will have an agenda closer aligned to your ideals than Trump/Pence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_H_D_ I don’t think this is really productive. But you do you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_H_D_ I figured, because I’m sitting here thinking what did I miss her say? Haha I’m not a huge fan, I think she can be quite opportunistic. But who isn’t?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_H_D_ Is your retweet a sarcastic comment?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@M_Caba86 It’s really easy just to say whatever you want and present it as fact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_H_D_ But seriously he’s such a great dog I love him 🥰  https://t.co/vpjg5ozDEF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_H_D_ Otto would like to say thank you!  https://t.co/rgg26ijfC8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewGopforUSA @realDonaldTrump Stop saying people hate their country when no one has said that. Are you projecting again?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@D_Blumentritt @BlaneErwin @justinamash Nancy Pelosi didn’t want to impeach Trump. It’s why articles weren’t brought up day one when Democrats took the House.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_H_D_ While I completely agree, I just feel from everything I watched the GOP is the culprit for making this a circus. No matter what evidence is presented they will never change their mind. Though there have been many missed opportunities from the Dems to make this appear bipartisan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C_H_D_ Can you elaborate?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MetcalfeMegan  https://t.co/L7kx0QYAqi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeadByBHVR twice now I’ve had an issue where I made my decisive strike skill check and did not escape the killers grasp. Anyone else having this issue? Help me out devs and look at this 😎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moderator: Vice President Biden how would you end domestic violence? Biden: We’re going to beat the shit out of it! #DemDebate #DemocraticDebate #byeden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yoalexrapz @realDonaldTrump @ufc So if the Democrats are doing nothing, what does this president have to fight against?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMarkMeadows @realDonaldTrump You should be ashamed of yourself for the lie(s) you’re promoting. But you’ve had 3 years to do what’s right yet you haven’t. Sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepDLamborn @realDonaldTrump You/the GOP should leak information showing Trump is innocent. I’ll wait.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Joe Biden currently isn’t in a government position (at all) to be holding this up...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill I’m fed up watching this. Also why is he acting so emotional?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader I hope destroying your credibility is worth defending our treasonous @POTUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorBraun so do our laws no longer apply to @POTUS?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenToddYoung so do our laws not apply to @POTUS?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stabyoulots @thehill Ok 👌🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stabyoulots @thehill No both parties are to blame for their short comings. But currently it’s the GOP. Girl next.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHarrisonDIV If someone is attractive they’re attractive but I am attracted to men.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bsudah @VelvetUndergr10 @thehill Same girl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bsudah @VelvetUndergr10 @thehill Ok then I don’t believe you love America<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bsudah @VelvetUndergr10 @thehill Good, I’d like to not have a corrupt leader. I don’t care what party they come from. I love America 🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tarzan_08 @VelvetUndergr10 @thehill Ok 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@admiral_nick @VelvetUndergr10 @thehill You got me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VelvetUndergr10 You didn’t even read what I said. I never said it would be ok for a Democrat to do. But if your standard is that this is ok, don’t be mad when a Democrat does it. My opinion is it’s never ok.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I share one thing negative about POTUS/GOP and all of the Trump loving nuts come out attacking me. A bunch of snowflakes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VelvetUndergr10 @thehill No. But if our 3 separate branches of government make this ok, then it’s ok for future presidents. I don’t like the erosion of our democracy and check and balances.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VelvetUndergr10 @Tarzan_08 @thehill Exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VelvetUndergr10 If Biden really is guilty then lock him up too. The same standard applies to everyone. Honestly I don’t like Biden, I don’t follow like a mindless sheep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tarzan_08 @VelvetUndergr10 @thehill Ok, cool bro.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VelvetUndergr10 @thehill Oh I think what he did was illegal, but if you want to play this game then go right ahead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tarzan_08 @VelvetUndergr10 @thehill Then why didn’t the Republican controlled House and Senate do something about it? Oh that’s right, because he didn’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VelvetUndergr10  https://t.co/5xBpF4yDM6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realPhilLacio @thehill Thanks man, you sure are a true American. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VelvetUndergr10 @thehill Laugh all you want, but when there’s a Democrat as president and they do what Trump has done, I don’t want to see your crocodile tears.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill The GOP and the President should apologize for the circus they have made our government into.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Because you’re a liar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NCHouseSpeaker You’re a sad excuse for a human being.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanCrenshawTX You don’t speak for the middle of the country. Stop acting like you can.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanCrenshawTX Why are you against responsible gun ownership? Also, NYC is a part of the USA, how patriotic of you to pretend NYC is less a part of America than where you approve to be American. Gtfo with your patriotic litmus test.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmilyMiller @AOC @DanCrenshawTX This isn’t the responsible thing to do though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanCrenshawTX Would you lend your car to someone who doesn’t have a license? You and others that think like this are truly perverting the second amendment. We just want responsible gun owners.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Do your job and stop acting like a child.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PressSec @realDonaldTrump This is disturbing and a waste of the tax dollars that pay your salary. Seriously disappointed that at every chance you and this administration has to be the bigger person you choose to be more deplorable. Why not just move on and focus on your agenda to MAGA?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darth_daisy_ It’s not a joke. I don’t know why people think it is.
