<|startoftext|>I miss writing! I feel I'm definitely ignoring one of the key components of the writerprenure concept. What to do, what to do?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy New Year all! I'm so excited to move into a new year and a new decade. And the new year...it's going to be amazing! Stay tuned!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SenJohnMcCain you didn't seem to carry when it was your buddy being bailed out, did you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ceeden tomorrow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today's a quiet catch-up day. Glad to have it since life is about to crazy in the new year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going out to dinner with my oldest daughter. Nice to have some one on one time with her.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ceeden whew! What a relief! Lol! I mean, there was the internet purse oogling!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ceeden I'm crossing my fingers too, since I'm responsible for your lack of productivity thus far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crystal Coons is a design wizard! The artwork she's creating is incredible! I'm so lucky to have her as a friend and colleague!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sherlock Holmes was definitely worth the time. They did a great job, not really true to the book but a fun ride nonetheless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shame on literary agents who send terse rejections the week of Christmas. Bad form. Glad I'm not invested in that process anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy Holidays from the Wyatt clan! We're wishing everyone love, and a happy and healthy new year. And peace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does shopping ever end or does it just roll into after Christmas shopping?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's official, I'm a weather wimp. I'm sitting here, wrapped in blankets & fleece, shivering in the desert. I'm so ashamed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, I finally began judging the PPWC. I've been meaning to get to it for weeks. Now I have to hurry. But it's exciting to judge new work!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the craziest day I've had in a while. Made a new friend at the grocery store and found an old friend on FB when I got home! Huh!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ceeden why not? I did! Traffic and check-outs were awful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RT: @SweetRepublic: Passing the 1000 follower mark would be a great Xmas present. Now at 991. Thanks for the new followers!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Happy Sunday means it's time to make a chocolate house! Hope I remember the chimney this year.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MoveOn That's incredible! I'm so proud to be a flaming liberal!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another great day with loads to do! What excitement!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Exhaustion can feel so satisfying!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boy did today get productive. Figured out two websites AND the book cover! Not to mention doing an interview for Attribute Magazine! WOW!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just did interview w/Attribute Magazine about LitSisters. It's so easy to share my excitement about this wonderful group of creative women!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woke shivering & with a terrible headache. Hope the horse pill I took gets rid of it. I just don't have the time today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Artwork is happening! Lawyer getting me copyright info. Quotes are rolling in and blurb is going to be superb! I love when life is exciting!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Things are coming together!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting ready for a cookie party! We love it - I get to socialize w/friends and the family gets all kinds of cookies. Best kind of win-win!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Got all the way across the valley w/time to spare. Hope these kids are interested in making up some characters. Kids are so creative!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Off to Phoenix to spend the day creating characters with eighth graders! It's one of my favorite parts of being a writer - writing w/kids!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, this is it. I'm going to bed, fingers crossed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ceeden keep what in mind?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tonight I'm taking melatonin so I can sleep. So if anyone gets up at 3:21 a.m., don't call me. I'll be in a hormone induced stupor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lonhaber yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenJohnMcCain Then why have you oposed it?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jessiepoet really cool! Congrats on such a big press hit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do I keep waking up at 3:21 am? Three nights in a row. This got old real quick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@changinghands I laughed because Kurt Vonnegut was rejected 800 times over his career. I've been rejected much more than 26. Ur right, tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@changinghands gee, just 26?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, I'm officially calling an end to my experiment w/technology in scheduling. I've ordered my new Daytimer pages. Paper wins.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ceeden give me 15 minutes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ceeden I could respond to that but my entire point will be made in the blog post I'm writing (now) for LS. When you read it you'll get it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ceeden can't wait for what? I can't wait to hear what you decided to do re collide? did my e-mail make sense?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay, Frieda, here we go. We're finishing this cookbook today, no matter what!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unfortunately, Frieda's cookbook will have to wait until tomorrow. Too much cooking and LitSisters stuff to do today. Sorry Frieda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today Frieda will finish dictating her recipes to me. I'm putting them in a book she can give 2 her girls. Maybe she'll share them with you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How can ADOT be soooo incompetent and still breathe? Took us 2-1/2 hours to get from Surprise to Chandler - 1 hour to go 4 miles! They suck!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Awesome author event @ Border's in Scottsdale! Great writers & great books.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ceeden liquid breakfast @ the saloon?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's a woman whose job in December is to listen to kids sing & give them a certificate when they finish. Nice gig!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Walked in to the capitol to hear Alvin & the Chipmunks singing their famous Christmas song. Ah, the holidays!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The wheels on the bus go round & round ... all the way to the state capitol. Abby's field trip is on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tomorrow I get to accompany my daughter to the capitol where her choir will perform and she will sing in a trio! She sings like an angel!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's done, it's done,  it's done. it's saved as a pdf, i don't have to look at it anymore. it better be right 'cause if i get it back...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SenJohnMcCain to quote one of your colleagues, "you lie."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Public Speaking lessons for a terrific presenter. Then off to LitSisters! I just love this group. I get energized just thinking about them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When life is wonderful it can still be exhausting. I'd give anything for a spa day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theazadventurer I feel so connected all the sudden! did you figure the LinkedIn/FB thing out?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My re-eval at the gym was excellent! More work coming my way, as well. And with the new year comes more excitement! Can't wait to tell you!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Back to the grind. One last line edit and then DONE!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ok, Snuggies are stupid! Those people in the ads must be sewn into them. It's like a long sleeve, fleece hospital johnny. I don't get it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenJohnMcCain Yes it is. Are you ashamed? You should be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My youngest is under the weather. It hurts my heart when they're sick.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ceeden I'm so sorry. Anything I can do? (I've actually been through this a lot) What are SFW plans?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenJohnMcCain Then you should introduce a bill creating "one issue only" legislation. Then there would be NO PORK!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenJohnMcCain Gee, sounds like the Patriot Act and all the other constitution violating legislation over the past 8 yrs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ceeden you're definitely going to need to be taken to dinner after all your hard work!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ceeden how exciting to get the minute by minute! My girls are dying to go. Alas, they have nothing for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YEA!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ceeden okay, what's going on? Am I going to find out?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Abby wore my custom made, circa 1968 fringed suede vest as part of her hippie costume and I painted her face. It was awesome! Took me back!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The times they are a changin'. To that end, an announcement ... soon!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenJohnMcCain gee, senator, if you don't like bail outs, why'd you bail out wall street? or do you just give friends money? like Keating?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's a new day - back 2 work 2 create the perfect synopsis.  Success will be mine! Then I earn a week off before my next book, Happy Trails.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SenJohnMcCain Excellent! Job creation! Tell me, would each worker have to line your pockets or just the corporation?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank god it's Friday. Jimmy's coming home and I can sleep in. Life is good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pinot Noir & a good women's fiction to edit. Damn fine way to spend an evening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It occurred to me that I owe sincere thanks to several writers who brought me up in my early days. It's a debt I've too long neglected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dinner @ FEZ! What a great place. And the manager, Thomas, is the absolute best! He beta read my book.  Thanks for the kind words, Thomas!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Working away on the synopsis - I know I can, I know I can - besides, when I sell I get a trip to NYC!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wouldn't it be wonderful to play hooky for the week and grab my girls and run to the beach? Oooh!  If only!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2 days of laundry/other "trip prep" items and Jim is ready for his trip home. Now I get 2 edit a great women's fic. Tomorrow, more synopsis.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hooky rocks! I was so relaxed after my afternoon by the pool! Now I can settle in and get loads done. Today is going to be a great day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Playing hooky is sooooooo good! Tomorrow will be that much better for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel like Opie Taylor @ the swimmin' hole. I'm playing hooky & hanging out w/2 terrific women @ the pool! Should feel guilty but I don't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ceeden I don't know what to do first, look for mandelbrot, rewrite, etc.  but I'm more jazzed than I've been for a while!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am the luckiest writer on earth. I have worked with the most amazing writers in 3 states, and been mentored by incredible talents! Yea!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ceeden and that would be?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I often wonder if stress can actually pop your head like a melon or if it just feels like it could. Off to edit. I find solace in the calm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Could I possibly have hit on a blurb that works? Impossible! I've only spent hours working on it, not weeks, months or years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just called & thanked Olbermann for his #1 story last night. It's a must watch - click on #1 at this link:  http://tinyurl.com/lzcgd<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Cluttered office - cluttered mind.  But what does it say about my mind if I can't seem to get my office cleaned?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a day! Lunch & dinner w/terrific women - We've met the best people since we moved to the valley! Tomorrow I clean my office - ugh!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Editing and laundering - it's terrific to multi-task. Plus, set up Jimmy's new laptop last night. I'm kickin' it! Now to my messy office :(<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>School started today. No excuses now. It's back to work.<|endoftext|>
