<|startoftext|>I think in my opinion lamelo'll do good. Even though he didn't score, he had 10 rebounds and a few assists. He might do good.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It would be nice if uzi dropped a song from one of his snippets on Christmas. The one where he said "made it from pluto to mars".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>MADE IT FROM PLUTO TO MARS🔥🔥🔥🤗🤗😤😤😤😤🤙🤙🤙🌙🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕 #babypluto<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally did all my homework.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think either Kendrick or Duncan. Cuz Kendrick ehh he's good but not as good like the other players. Duncan. He's great but harden i think is better than him. What y'all think?🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>🤦🤦<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just because you don't like Joe Biden/Donald Trump doesn't mean you can just throw away ballots, burn peoples ballots and illegally vote multiple times. That's not cool like at all. It's unfair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't trust those electoral votes anymore. The dems cheated!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnCornyn He used 100 million dollars to bail people and pay their legal fines just so that they could vote for Biden. I believe that's bribery?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Quit talking smack about Trump Joe HIDEN. he's "tearing" away obamacare was because it put multiple doctors out of business and the premiums went up and healthcare became expensive. Obama added more regulations to this typa stuff.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And y'all wanna vote for the democrats?? Cmon mann<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The media gives biden better press but give trump bad press? Like how does that make sense? How is that fair?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The lady that interviewed Trump did super terrible. She keeps cutting off Trump after she asked a question to him and he answers. When he answers the question, she cuts him off right away🤦🤦<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrumpStudents Which put a lot of African Americans in prison for no reason and it's not good. Very messed up. Very bad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Obamacare put multiple doctors out of business and the premiums went up like crazy and the healthcare became twice as expensive.  Obamacare is no good!! Get it right!!!! @JoeBiden #Trump2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Fake news. They handled it perfectly by traveling ban from China and traveling ban from the USA to China and sent multiple masks and ventilators to everyone. It was Chinas fault that the virus went to the USA. Not trumps. Get ya facts right!!! @KamalaHarris<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kamala really avoided the damn question about packing the court🤦🤦🤦. Answer the question!!! #Trump2020 #Mikepence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And she made a joke about smoking marijuana in the breakfast club w Charlamagne after she was asked about it and also after she put black people in prison.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But overall mike did really good💪💪🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸💯💯 #Trump2020 #TrumpPence2020 #Mikepence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>but putting black people in prison for marijuana charges and MADE A JOKE about smoking marijuana in the breakfast club w Charlamagne when asked if Kamala Harris smokes weed. She did it on video.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mike Pence did good. Not gonna lie. Excellent Job. But what Mike Pence could've done was expose her for not only putting black people in Jail................<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who's watching the vice presidential debate tonight??🤔🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boom. Easy Exposure👀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We also got Mike Bloomberg who paid like 10 million dollars to bail out a buncha looney tunes characters just to cast their vote. Bribery?? Mhmm... We got Omar who got caught for voter fraud or sum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We also got Joe Biden Barack Obama James Comey and 2 others who spied on Trumps campaign which is treason👀 before and after the campaign. They also used the FBI to get at trump over some Russia connections. They got Michael Flynn locked up as a way to get at Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's see how many democratic animals we got🤔🤔 We got Hillary Clinton, who used classified information from the government to illegally share it with other people from her email. And she deleted 30,000 something emails then breaks her phone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yea i don't think that plans gonna work out because Obamacare destroyed everyone. If it was nationalized people are gonna be having a hard time finding doctors and appointments.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>He's a terrible moderator.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bro tbh Chris Wallace is a clown because sometimes when Trump talks he just cuts him off. They stop him more than stopping Joe Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First off, he didn't just "say things to make us better". He did a lot of good things for our country including cutting taxes and regulations and adding 10 millionaire jobs into the USA. What have u done for 47 years? NOTHING!!!👀 @JoeBiden #trump2020.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@theRealKiyosaki Facts. The reason why kids don't like going to school is because they don't teach you anything valuable. Simple stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr It's because he got involved in commiting treason also.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok trump has done nothing abusive to our country. He made a peace deal w Israel and brought 10 million jobs to our country. If he was a dictator he would've done a whole buncha crazy which he didn't do. He also increased employment for African Americans which means they get jobs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok fake news. First of all. That was fidel Castro. He's a dictator. Not trump. Fidel castro nationalized multiple businesses which means it was owned by the government.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PollWatch2020 @realDonaldTrump We need to raise that 52 percent up quick before it's too late. I'm still keeping my word on voting for Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is it so hard improving on friendships after you've tried becoming a better friend towards that person after crazy stuff happens? EXPLAIN.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hodgetwins @iamcardib @JoeBiden And also why he said some racist comments towards Charlamagne from the breakfast club?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hodgetwins @iamcardib @JoeBiden And ask Joe Biden why he spied on trump which is treason.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>He'd probably say "nah don't listen to the haters bro. They mostly don't have purpose if they talk smack towards other people".<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@shane_pineda_ 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shane_pineda_ Agreed and The heat didn't do a good job either yesterday. I got bored after the first half. They weren't serious about playing defense yesterday. They were behind 18 points almost throughout the whole game including the 3rd and 4th quarter🤷🤷🤷🤷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>During the week:😜😜😜😜😜😝😛😜😝😅😂😂😁😁😁😁  Sundays:😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm so freaking tired!!!!!!!😤😤😤😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😫😫😩😩😩😫😫😫😫😩😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>False. Biden is just saying that just so trump could lose. Only 6% percent passed away due to covid according to the CDC. They came out and told us that after they lied to us about a 1 million ppl died from covid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/Ml14fSwxlg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealWoahVicky And Pride is forever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tbh i got bored of watching the heat after the end of the first half. They're not even playing good offense or defense. I knew they were gonna lose after they were behind my multiple points. They weren't playing serious. Hopefully they'll get better next game💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fake news. He's fighting hard to protect Tik tok users from the CCP and from getting hacked and he's trying to have the vaccine ready by between October and December so that we'll all be cured . He doesn't shut things down for the fun of it. He doesn't do that typa stuff.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|> https://t.co/iLoL8k9mm6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For protection against the CCP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because the Chinese Communist Party is planning to hack into peoples tik tok accounts and steal peoples personal info which is not right and it's a Chinese app. The media won't tell you. Only Fox news and trump would tell you that. He did it for protection and i agree.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>JOE HIDIN!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And also what is this hear about this stupid show "Cuties" on Netflix?🤦🤦🤦🤢🤢🤢. Netflix needs to do sum bout that show. Cuz Netflix is upsetting me a little bit. Not a spiritual show fam. That's not god-pleasing. It's a bad show. Guys don't watch that show.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yesterday i just watched the first episode of "Trump: an American dream" on Netflix. Pretty good. Gotta finish the whole season<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Let's hope the heat will beat the Celtics w a 4 game sweep. Well it would be nice if it could happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So why, as a USA president, which was obama and biden, would they send jobs to china under the nafta deal when they should be providing jobs for their own country not for China? I heard that They get paid to do that which is basically financial suicide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fake news. Trump has added more jobs in the USA. He added 10 million jobs at an all time high. Raised the stock market. I think he got rid of nafta i think and signed a deal where more jobs will be coming to the USA from China. I also heard jobs from mexicos coming into the usa.  https://t.co/RfsXWdNMkV<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Thank god🙏.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yea man. Tell that to Portland also. They're not asking for the national Guard. If they don't do something, then the National Guard will do something. They gotta get the Democrat run cities under control. #Trump2020LandslideVictory @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Dude tbh the heat game was soo trash today smh. The heat didn't even take a lead one time i don't think. It's like they tried but didn't even try. Too many missed shots. Too many bad shot selections. And we don't have dragic or butler. If we can have them back,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yea. They're losing like crazy. I only watched the 2nd half. I didnt even bother to watch the 2nd half on t.v because of how they're losing. The heat needs to step up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/av8Qp8dVeX PROOF: Joe Biden says he's gonna raise taxes. 3 to 4 trillion dollars in taxes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Bro i was sooo freaking dizzy this morning. I couldn't even concentrate on anything.😵😵😵. I had to keep drinking and drinking water constantly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which is why I'm not voting for Joe Biden. I'm voting for TRUMP🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸#trump2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That right there is the definition of racism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't understand how these people are still supporting Joe Biden after he just said some racist comments talking bout oh "unlike African Americans, Hispanics/Latins have a diversity of thought".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes I passionately believe that black lives do matter but i just don't believe that taking a knee during the pledge would be the right answer. It goes against what us Christians know about the word of God and what they believe about God. It goes against my faith🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tbh in case if you guys ask me I'm gonna continue watching sports but I'm just not gonna support where the NBA is going w taking a knee during the pledge and supporting the BLM group, a group that's controlled by Marxists. I can't support that. Period.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iMrFreshPrince They're injured. One of them had a problem w their foot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Andrew Cuomo?!?!? Oh nooooo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ik right??? I'm not happy at that either. I was talking to a couple homies about this and they don't perceive this as a problem. I'm like dude how are u not seeing this? I understand why they're doing it but still it's disrespectful and we need to respect our country and the flag<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#prayforjonathanisaac<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Y'all ever get SOOOO knocked out after working out at the gym? That's where I'm at Rn. I can't do nun.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Trump banning tik tok because of the CCPs plan to take over tik tok and seek peoples personal information from other peoples tik tok accounts? GOOD!!! Cuz why i say that? Because china just likes to cause problems and they're god awful people. They're communists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok. Idk what else to even say now. This is ridiculous🤦. Now the heat is kneeling. I just can't with this bruh....smhhh. Shout out to Meyers Leonard for standing up during the pledge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If u were to ask me "would I stand up for the pledge or kneel?" Homie I would stand up. PERIOD.🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 #USA #freedom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I mean bro what's the flag gotta do with police brutality? The flag didn't do none. The flag ain't got no arms, no legs, and it can't talk. Why? It's not supposed to. It's supposed to represent our country that we live in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bro now the NBA NFL and the MLB are being mixed with politics. The whole lakers team took a knee during the pledge🤦🤦. Bro i understand why they're doing it because of what happened to George Floyd but still You gotta show respect to the flag and the Country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ik i did not just see LeBron James including his team taking a knee during the pledge. This is getting out of control.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WeRAchievers Time i believe imo is more valuable than money because with time, once u waste let's say a second a minute or a day, you won't get it back. There's no turning back. While for money, you can lose money and have it back. Money comes and goes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mrsblack83 @HotNewHipHop @CNN I'm like "bro who buys their ex girlfriend/ex boyfriend a valentines day when they broke up?" I think that's the stupidest thing to do like ever.

<|startoftext|>@bruno_the_joker @datboi_create Ok alr alr whatever. But the thing is he grew up in an environment where people did that and his dad and/or got involved in gang activities. Tay k grew up seeing that and it drew influence to Tay k. So I believe it's both their faults including tay k<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@datboi_create @bruno_the_joker I agree witchu young blood<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@datboi_create @bruno_the_joker Exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bruno_the_joker @datboi_create Well it's not tayks fault that his dad was locked up and not being able to provide for tayk. It's the environment that he was in. But i believe tayk couldve tried his best to get out of that lifestyle but it was hard for tayk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bruno_the_joker @datboi_create I still believe if he wasn't found guilty he should get at least the same amount like Bobby or get 5 years instead of getting like 55 cuz that was an unfair sentencing IMO. Or like i said get probation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@datboi_create @bruno_the_joker That's bcuz he came from the hood. He had a very tough background too actually. One of his parents were gang members too. His dad was in prison during tayks childhood.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@datboi_create @bruno_the_joker But that's what i said tho no? Cuz tayk didn't shoot them. He only planned to rob them according to his lawyers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bruno_the_joker @datboi_create Yea<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bruno_the_joker @datboi_create Well i guess u right homie but still no matter if he didn't shoot them or not, if u can't do the time don't do the crime. But still i believe he didn't shoot them. He only planned to rob them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bruno_the_joker @datboi_create But he didn't kill them. He only planned to rob them and that was it. Tay k didn't shoot those guys. That's why we were considering probation for tayk. Even tayks lawyers said that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@datboi_create Yea i agree witchu on that one. Well aye homie all we gotta do is just pray and see if he can get probation at least so we can get some hits🔥🔥😎. #freetayk #freepimpyz @tayk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's so weird that they didn't announce if tayks appeal got denied or not. He did file an appeal after he got smacked up with 55 years. Let's see if they'll either reduce his years, get probation or get acquitted which that will be big.😈😈😎😎. #FREETAYK<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Like for example if i were to hear things like from "oh this guy can't do this bcuz he's black" to "ok I'm finna get the strap and go shoot him cuz of his success and he's white, black or whatever. That's when Racism should be illegal👿👿<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I believe Racism should be considered illegal bcuz of what just happened to pop smoke today. From Hatred to Murder, From Words to Actions Racism gets worse👿👿👿. That's what gets me frustrated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#rippopsmoke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The people who are famous mostly went through hard work, tough times and obstacles. Most of these rappers came from the trenches bcuz of how their parents were and what environment they were in. #rippopsmoke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't understand Y it's such a big deal to be committing violence based off of their jealousy. Is this how this world should be? No right? Exactly. What's wrong with seeing people become successful? You should be happy and show support towards them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's the same story we hear of black people and/or rappers getting shot because of their race and mainly their success. Racism is the act that shouldn't be supported at all bro. We need to respect and show honor to people that are around us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is just sad man. Pop smoke passing away? Even though i never heard much of the rapper, but this is just very heartbreaking to hear. I'm starting to get sick and tired of rappers and black people getting shot like that. This upsets me and my little heart can't take this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>24/5 days a week. The New York session closes at 5. The forex market is closed on weekends. On Sunday at 5 P.M the Sydney session opens first in the forex market which defines that forex opens at 5 P.M on Sunday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Either logic, X or Mac Miller. Either one of them.💯💯💯🐐🐐🐐.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rest in peace X  https://t.co/oOmmyyRsJ1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And not only that, you could get rich off of trading Forex in like 2 to 3 years. It will be easier for you to trade forex and get rich due to the liquidity and there's no single entity and specialist in the forex market. But this ain't no get rich quick scheme.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's wayyyyy better than stocks bro. Even though the stock market did went up in 3 days in a row, i still wouldn't trust the stock market bcuz you have to pay commissions for stocks and the specialist would increase transaction cost which makes stocks expensive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The difference between the bid price and the ask price.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Logic301 Young Sinatra is like the ghost of a 90s rapper. An old school rapper😎😎😎✊✊✊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Logic301 he made his own Rattpack (Real All The Time) which is a group of guys including @6ixVMG. Just like Frank Sinatra did back in his days, he would call his female fans the bobbysoxers and Logic would call himself young Sinatra.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Logic301 the reason why peace love and positivity was and is his motto cuz he was trying to articulate himself the way Frank Sinatra was in his career. That's why he is what he is cuz he's a hip hop who has shown honor and love to his fans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Logic301 the reason why young sinatra is going Sinatra is bcuz Frank Sinatra was one of logics influences. His mom would actually force him to watch old movies which has the black and white background. He made a persona where he showcased grace honor and valor and peace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Logic301 He's like the uncle of hip hop bcuz he would always become an example of how a great person is supposed to be and he would provide for his fans. Motivate his fans to succeed in whatever they wanna do in life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No offense to y'all hip hop fans. But @Logic301. Should've been the most influential artist of the decade cuz bro young sinatra provided us positive messages in his music and in life throughout his whole career. He brought the boombap rap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's no failing. There's lessons. Failing teaches you lessons in what you gotta do to improve in life.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Girrrllll amen to that. Preach. Speak them facts💯💯💯💯. @AlyciaTyre<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Schools teach you critical stuff but not about money. They don't teach you about financial education. That's why kids are broke and not rich. That's why kids ended up getting jobs bcuz of the environment they came and bcuz of what they've been taught in school.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mannn i need to get better sleep.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The Forex Markets divided into 4 sessions. Sydney Tokyo London and New York. The best days to trade are Tuesday through Thursday cuz it has more pip movements and it has more liquid. When the london and the New York session overlap, that's when it has more liquidity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Traditional Education ain't the way brother. Financial Education is the way💯💯💯.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>REST IN PEACE X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Assets make you rich. Liabilities make you poor. Like having a million dollars doesn't mean you rich you just have a lot of money. Having MULTIPLE streams of income which means more money come into your pocket makes you rich. This is why financial education is very critical.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fr bruh. Screw that. Popeyes chicken sandwich is the way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YOOO. THAT'S GONNA BE INTENSE. AFTER THAT, 6IX9INES GONNA GET SENTENCED IN 2 WEEKS😳😳😳😳😳😳<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It'd be nice if the heat trades dion for eric bledsoe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well dion needs to get his mind up bro. Cuz he's causing problems lately. I wanted him to be traded bcuz he took shots at herro and spoelstra on social media. Dissing aint the way brother.<|endoftext|>

The standard lot has 100,000 currencies whlle the smallest lot, which is the nano lot, holds about 100 currencies. We can trade nano,micro, mini and standard.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Currencies which is technically money<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It has high liquidity, low barriers to entry, and you don't need to pay commission. You would have narrow focus in forex while in stocks you have a wide focus which means it will be easier to focus on 4 currencies at least than focusing on thousands of stocks.

<|startoftext|>It's crazy that people say that 2 to 5 years is a very long time to get rich but working in a 9 to 5 for 30 to 40 years is not a long time for 99% of the people. It's a long time of being broke and not rich.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I can't stop talking about @Logic301. Cuz his music has helped me out throughout tough experiences including when i was in high school and back in 11th grade, which was the worst year i could ever experience in high school. It helped me cope with anger pain and anxiety.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The soul of Young Sinatra will be forever be implanted in my heart. It'll be a classic by the time by the time the project becomes 10 years old @Logic301  https://t.co/47MqbWbphi<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Rocky200514 @Logic301 @xxxtentacion @MacMiller Young Sinatra is like the ghost of a 90s rapper. But that ghost is gone brother. He made his last young sinatra project. He's moving on to a new style of music. Logic didn't die though. The reason i say it like that cuz young sinatras like the second person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rocky200514 @Logic301 @xxxtentacion @MacMiller Well no but look here's the thing though. The reason why i say it like that. Cuz young sinatra is his alter ego. He's like a person but that's his alter ego where he made 90s influenced beats and he put deep creative storylines in his lyrics and he has deadly punchlines.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Poor kids don't like school because they like to chill and play video games and get a job. Rich Kids don't like school because they don't give you financial education nor teach you how to invest and create a business.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Bro i just went to Popeyes on 8th street today and they only accept cash not debit and credit. Thats bullcrap. That's just an excuse. They should've had the system set up before they start letting them customers wildin out for them sandwiches. Straight bustas smhhhh<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I hate it when people offer to help you with stuff but then later on they do the opposite which converts to lying possibly. Retweet if you agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So yea man it was the worst bro. Its harder to get my crush from high school to be my Valentine cuz we're in college and it was easier back in high school including my junior year cuz me and my crush were in the same school together for 2 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Then in my senior year i didnt try cuz she left my school. But then my long time friend who also offered to help me, became her Valentine and i got upset cuz of what i saw.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I believe that Every year on Valentines Day that a girl would choose a guy who brought a present for her over a guy who didnt buy her a present. My first Valentine could've been when i was 16. Look at me im 18 and i still didn't get my first Valentine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And yet this kid becomes her Valentine like what the hell dude? He didn't even do anything for her. I did something for her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's so sickening and very heartbreaking that i lost my money buying a present because of this. This kid clearly said that he was supposed to help me out with her. Then he lied about it and asked Vale a month before Valentines Day. Bro this kid didnt even buy her a present<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well Even though Valentines Day is over, man I'm sick and tired of not being to get my first Valentine bro😭😭😭😭💔💔💔😭😭💔💔. The first time i tried was back in my junior year. This kid stole my valentine after he said he was gonna help me get with this girl.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>For some reason after a few days it feels like It's the same year and you feel like ur the same person but it's a new year. #2019<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Khyalifornia Yea Pretty much. Straight facts💯💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nik42R Ooh dang😳. I guess you're right. Maybe Offset should let her go. But everybody makes mistakes Vro I believe that a great marriage comes from failures. There may be bad marriages but they get better because of the mistakes they make. Like having success comes from  failures. 💯🙏  https://t.co/fIEqcvkeo9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nik42R Iom wanna judge on ur opinion but why u say that? Offset made a mistake and he wasn't gonna do it again after Cardi B hit him with a divorce. I believe that they should get back together cuz they just had a baby and offsets focusing on making his new album : (<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dominos Bacon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I may be starting to lose interest in lil uzi cuz of his representation as the devil. That's gotta have shocked people with those comments right there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm looking at this guy like uzi what is you saying? I'm like what the heck? He's basically showing off his satanic vibes and that just saddens me. I mean his musics fire but what he said was just over the top. I happen to be a loving Christian.🙏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bro I'm very disappointed about what Lil Uzi Vert said. It was very threatening what he said in his performance. I've heard worse things but THIS? This is getting outta hand. He basically told his fans that they're going to hell with him.<|endoftext|>
