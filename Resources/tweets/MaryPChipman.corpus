<|startoftext|>@jess_207 @SharkDancing @davidsmi @PeejLoewen @ryancbriggs Apparently you can still shed #Covid_19 if you're vaccinated, so mask wearing will be with us for a long time.

<|startoftext|>@DFisman @DrKevinSchwartz A source of so much frustration when we know asymptomatic &amp; presymptomatic cases account for up to 60% of spread.

<|startoftext|>@ianjamesyoung70 On Thursday Dr Henry &amp; @adriandix present the latest modelling: this is an opportunity to be more precise &amp; issue sterner restrictions for the next 2 weeks to rein in #COVID19BC while we still can. Still don't see why we can't have the #covidalertapp if only to increase awareness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshuaDiemert Haha, so true!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ianjamesyoung70 Agree. These new rules are meant to address where BC sees the most transmission but they are far too ambiguous &amp; nuanced for the public. It's just so much easier to say mandatory indoor masks, outdoor fitness only &amp; no social gatherings for 2 weeks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now Howie Meeker! 2020 is just relentless. I loved Howie's colourful hockey commentary, his energy, excitement &amp; joy. He had such a zest for life. Many condolences to his family, friends &amp; hockey fans everywhere. #RIPHowieMeeker #NHL #hockey<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_K_I_W_I @atptour @AlexZverev @RolexPMasters Rooting for Medvedev whose wife is a good friend of Olya's, apparently.

<|startoftext|>@atptour @AlexZverev @RolexPMasters Truly appalling you haven't addressed the domestic abuse allegations against Zverev.

<|startoftext|>OK, BC, 2 weeks to get serious about flattening the curve. We know the drill; now do it! Party now &amp; you might never party again or your parents &amp; grandparents.

<|startoftext|>@elizsamuels @richardzussman @GlobalBC If they are currently in your family bubble (but not actually living with you) it's OK. That's what I understood. We're in the same boat with our adult kids but it seems we can continue seeing each other indoors.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>There's a long road ahead &amp; for some it's a dead end. Celebrate today #uspoli; tomorrow the work begins. It won't be easy, it'll be messy, but it has to happen.

<|startoftext|>@jack_milroy @Khelsilem At this point in BC, absolutely!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeCanardQuoi Yes, it certainly needs to be improved; BC hasn't adopted it as it doesn't contact trace &amp; may lead to unnecessary testing. But having an app has a psychological benefit of Covid awareness which we all need now. People might behave more responsibly with the app. Anything helps!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeCanardQuoi I believe itt's because it works on Bluetooth so as to protect privacy; the #covidalertapp doesn't use the location function on cellphones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>C'mon, BC! Let's get serious about #covid19: we still have a short window of opportunity to flatten the curve somewhat &amp; control #COVID19BC before healthcare gets too stressed &amp; more people suffer &amp; die. Please @jjhorgan we need the #covidalertapp ! People, party when it's safe!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Khelsilem There's no perfect solution &amp; of course, regional restrictions don't prevent people escaping them to travel to those without. But with these numbers &amp; the exponential curve we're on, other measures are needed. It's only a matter of time before healthcare will be overburdened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adriandix Can BC FINALLY GET THE #covidalertapp ? I gather it's been improved with tighter data. Please let us get this additional tool to prevent Covid spread. It may lead to further testing-not a bad thing now- &amp; it'd certainly lead to more #COVID19 awareness which is desperately needed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Khelsilem Regional lockdown, as other jurisdictions are doing. Some are doing just night curfews; others full-on lockdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adriandix Time to amp up the messaging &amp; consider regional lockdowns. I know pressers are time-consuming for both you &amp; Dr Henry, but holding them frequently - daily, like this past spring - underscored how urgent Covid is. People have taken their feet off the pedal &amp; have relaxed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Atomic_Walrus @EmmMacfarlane Well, unless there's a medical reason otherwise, anyone inside a healthcare facility must wear a mask in my book.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Atomic_Walrus @EmmMacfarlane One Chilliwack dance studio has at least 26 cases linked to it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Atomic_Walrus @EmmMacfarlane School boards have the option, hence the unevenness in mask wearing. I agree it would be more helpful to have it a rule. Still, there haven't been that many exposures. Parties are the culprit. All the healthcare facilities that I know of have mask rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmmMacfarlane BC doesn't need mandatory mask rules; most retail stores &amp; all transit demand it, as do many municipal offices. The huge problem is parties, weddings &amp; funerals, especially in Fraser Health that has 80% of current cases. There is a religious component here, as evidenced in QC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeCanardQuoi @adriandix Nothing is easy with #COVID19 &amp; the human need for socialization has made that obvious. Mask wearing is key; I think the #covidalertapp is a particularly useful awareness tool, for those needing more control over their anxiety/fear &amp; those less aware of Covid in their midst.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeCanardQuoi @adriandix My guess is BC wants a robust tool that won't lead to unnecessary testing; currently they don't encourage asymptomatic testing. But psychologically I think the Covid app makes for more awareness of the disease &amp; its presence in every community. Too many are blind to it = spike.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeCanardQuoi @adriandix BC wants it to be more robust as an add-on to contact tracing; more information on the nature of exposure to help the user decide on need for testing/isolation. There may be tech limitations as it's running on Bluetooth &amp; has privacy controls that may make such tools complicated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeCanardQuoi @adriandix Really? All the more reason BC should adopt it then. The argument is that there's not enough exposure context to make it a more agile tool. My guess is that there's concern it may increase testing, even though contact may be minimal or even non-existent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adriandix It's time to enable the federal #covidalertapp in BC. It's a valuable tool we need now as cases are soaring. In fact, the thing you don't like about it-that exposure notifications are too general-might be the very thing that convinces people that Covid is in their hood<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mileslunn @maxfawcett @anniegirl1138 Actually, this recent election shows that this isn't true anymore; the high real estate prices of the last 2 decades as triggered by Christy Clark's BCLib 16 year govt has pushed younger &amp; progressive voters to the Interior which saw new #NDP victories in Langley &amp; Chilliwack.<|endoftext|>

This fellow is clearly accelerating his harassment, threats &amp; stalking. While the police sit on their hands, waiting for him to escalate further.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@calmecam @maxfawcett Yes, sad and very true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hope4OCT @calmecam @maxfawcett Ah, Stephen Harper &amp; the firewall letter: “It is imperative to take the initiative, to build firewalls around Alberta, to limit the extent to which an aggressive and hostile federal government can encroach upon legitimate provincial jurisdiction.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hope4OCT @calmecam @maxfawcett I vividly remember that too! And BC had its forestry industry decimated; Ontario much of its manufacturing. All forgotten by Albertan conservatives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hope4OCT @calmecam @maxfawcett So true, this is a measure that could clearly help Alberta.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hope4OCT @calmecam @maxfawcett  https://t.co/gf9W001H0q<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hope4OCT @calmecam @maxfawcett It's so very sad as they are deluding Albertans &amp; deceiving oil workers with the false message that everything will be fine with the next pipeline. Look at what California is legislating: this is just the start.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hope4OCT @calmecam @maxfawcett Me too. This was the discourse over 40 years ago! They've had generations to diversify their economy &amp; safeguard &amp; invest their returns wisely. But nobody did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@calmecam @Hope4OCT @maxfawcett Crux of the issue is Alberta has latched on to oil as an essential part of their provincial identity &amp; mythology; their sports teams &amp; school curriculum etc.. have wrapped their flag around it. Quebec did this with asbestos &amp; only managed to sever ties when the world outlawed it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@calmecam @maxfawcett Yes, that's true! Particularly find it amusing when they go on about their Constitutional rights, parroting lines from US TV shows! But civics &amp; history are taught; these folks just don't want to learn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@calmecam @maxfawcett Well, I never received a class on civics either; my kids definitely got more than I ever did. I think it's more to do with the 24 hour news cycle &amp; social media: platforms looking for easily digestible info &amp; human interest filler; conservatives portraying education as elitist..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@calmecam @Hope4OCT @maxfawcett It will never happen. The discourse will only shift to whataboutism...the next pipeline, more oil &amp; gas subsidies etc. All the while this pandemic will further drive down demand for oil. But Alberta will continue to bury its head in its tarsands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hope4OCT @maxfawcett @calmecam I think it's more that conservatives think this rhetoric makes them look strong, decisive &amp; action-oriented to satisfy their base. But all their doing is fanning flames of discontent &amp; division with government partners.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MirandaFatur Horrible...&amp; it is frightening! I know it won't stop you from doing your important work: know we're all behind you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maxfawcett @calmecam Trudeau can buy every pipeline available &amp; pour every dollar the federal government has &amp; still be hated by most of Alberta. It's extremely worrisome how Cdn politics is being so personalized, fetishizing the personalities of leaders, ignoring facts, discourse or public policies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erinotoole Let's face facts: something your party isn't familiar with. You're deliberately concocting this story of a national unity crisis to stir your base &amp; align the CPC with separatist elements in Alberta, the Prairies &amp; Quebec. So you're manufacturing disunity. That's all you got?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markcritch @rkg_000 This is alarming &amp; more so as he's a repeat offender: a campaign of intimidation, threats &amp; assaults &amp; he gets released by @OttawaPolice?? That police don't take right-wing groups seriously obviously emboldens them more. Very disturbing!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@asifintoronto @bruce_arthur @Garossino @EmmMacfarlane I agree - any publicity is good; any retweets of their memes &amp; hateful speech with a pointed comment still amplifies their voices, stirs the pot &amp; falsely makes them important.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@1loriking @David_Moscrop Agree. Advamce poliing was a great success last election. Am no fan of an election now, particularly when the Greens just elected a new leader days ago, but don't think Horgan will see a backlash. Lots of BCers would like to see the BCLibs eroded to force a wholesale change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@David_Moscrop Dr Henry has been asked in press conferences about how an election would look under Covid; they've been in talks already with ElectionsBC &amp; she mentioned that holding an election over 2 days to accommodate physical distancing was an example of changes they're looking at.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@vickyyyf @DrJenGunter Thank you, of course, those with permanent residency can return, as can diplomats &amp; some students, although this depends when their student visa was issued, so they must check with immigration officials first.

<|startoftext|>@stephcoombs @alisonborealis @jkenney Instead, Jason Kenney is happy to jerk around the health &amp; safety of Albertans. #abpoli #cdnpoli #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrJenGunter No, don't see it happening until there's a vaccine. Citizens are welcome to return, but must comply with a 14 day quarantine, which is monitored by border authorities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannySeesIt Thank you for making Canada better &amp; congratulations for all you've accomplished!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@paulaakpan @alisonborealis It's appalling, hypocritical &amp; disgraceful that these courts policing sport are mandating artificially controlling one's natural body chemistry without regard to health risks, ethics &amp; autonomy over one's body.

<|startoftext|>@Garossino That Morneau didn't see the need to recuse himself, knowing his two daughters are tied to WE, one a full-time employee, the other a speaker, just spoke to his inability to see how muddy the waters were.

<|startoftext|>@David_Moscrop Plus it hedges Trudeau's bets should Mackay actually win CPC leadership &amp; he has to make the Liberals look more fresh &amp; forward-thinking. Or if some fringe candidate wins &amp; he can draw off the socially progressive conservatives.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@j_mcelroy And few people in hospital. 'Young' people are more relaxed thinking they won't get terribly sick, forgetting the danger that attitude &amp; their possible sickness has on more vulnerable people. As well, the 'being outdoors won't get me sick' mentality. This behaviour is global tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@David_Moscrop Trudeau knows he can buy 10 pipelines &amp; not get a single vote out of Alberta. Why not take a bite out of the left side of things? Going green might bleed NDP &amp; Green votes &amp; get youth abstainers &amp; indigenous voters who've soured on Liberals. Plus it's good policy. #cdnpoli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@David_Moscrop I dunno - the opposition &amp; media relished WE &amp; this allows Trudeau to turn the page.

<|startoftext|>@jdouglaslittle @CharlieAngusNDP @JustinTrudeau Comparing looks &amp; the way people speak is straight out of high school. It may be OK for you, but not for me &amp; many others who expect more substance from elected officials.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jdouglaslittle @CharlieAngusNDP @JustinTrudeau Not saying that at all. I'm saying this type of personality insult is out of the CPC playbook &amp; detracts from proper political discourse. I don't care what leaders look or sound like. It's a lazy political jab.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharlieAngusNDP @JustinTrudeau Honestly, stick to the issues! I know the bar for political discourse is low, but this is ridiculous. You're better than this..or were. Don't mimic the CPC.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FBoivinGatineau Erasing women seemed just fine with many MPs. So sad! Thanks for your comments on @PnPCBC - totally agree. 4 hours of many useless questions that don't get into WE governance &amp; nuts &amp; bolts of the program itself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acoyne Not at all; his talking over the answers was frustrating &amp; exasperating. Why ask questions if you're not interested in answers? Legitimate questions remain unanswered after 4 hours. Also, MPs were fine erasing Margaret Trudeau &amp; Sophie Gregoire who both have independent careers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@natnewswatch It belongs to Canadians, not the PM. Either he knows this &amp; doesn't care, just to score easy political points with CPC base or he doesn't &amp; is wilfully ignorant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robertwakulat @Justin_Ling @BCorporation I wish there were more questions &amp; light shed on this. It would be interesting to hear from more charities &amp; NPOs on this topic. Perhaps a silver lining is new legislation to clear these structures up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh, this Finance Committee meeting is so bloody obnoxious: finally an opportunity to get answers from WE, but all we get are questions &amp; Charlie Angus &amp; Pierre Poilievre talking over the #Kielburgers.

<|startoftext|>@TomPark1n @edwood3 Although a charity (albeit w convoluted structure/interests); moreso points to how small our civil space truly is.

<|startoftext|>@mizfolia @MichelleRempel @JesseBrown There's absolutely no barrier for Rempel to return to Canada. The border is open for Canadians &amp; permanent residents. All she has to do is a 14 day quarantine. But she prefers to stay in a state with rampant Covid rather than supporting her constituents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichelleRempel @JesseBrown What about you supposedly representing your constituents in another country in the middle of a pandemic? That's also pretty outrageous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JesseBrown @CochraneCBC just gave you credit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dr. Bonnie Henry has repeatedly called for decriminalizing drugs for personal use. We're losing so many to the opioid crisis, an addiction crisis made much worse w Covid19. Drug addiction is a mental health issue, not a crime. @JoyceMurray @PattyHajdu @CPHO_Canada @DavidLametti<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoraHeuer @EnglundBob And lowering business taxes which would decrease federal government revenue, adding also to the deficit.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jenn_Pastrak @rkg_000 @Justin_Ling Truly wretched reporting from most of MSM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andy_utoronto @Christine_McNab @Laurie_Garrett BC jumped ahead of the fed govt in mandating &amp; enforcing 14 day quarantine on all entering the province. Some provinces shut down their borders to others. BC also had elite lab testing that allowed it to ramp up. Emphasizing how airborne virus is before fed advice solidified too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andy_utoronto @Christine_McNab @Laurie_Garrett Pros are some provinces have very expert health officers able to act nimbly when social deficiencies emerged that would be a Covid19 vector; nursing homes, temporary foreign workers, food processing plants etc, &amp; had provincial govts who listened, put in $$$ to solve problems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joannachiu Yikes, how appalling - what a way to crush your hopes of journalism! But you didn't let it stop you! 💪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thethriftygene @Laurie_Garrett @EVargasTV You were talking healthcare &amp; testing; separate issues. LTCs are not covered by national healthcare; something that will likely change in the future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Christine_McNab @Laurie_Garrett As a fellow Canadian, Covid has shown us the pros &amp; cons of the provinces having jurisdiction over health. Lots of fodder for interesting studies on federalism &amp; public health.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thethriftygene @Laurie_Garrett @EVargasTV No, the deaths have been in long term care facilities, where underpaid staff would work in multiple sites, thus spreading Covid. The worse offenders being for profit nursing homes. Covid has shown us how poorly we treat our seniors in care. We need to do much better.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HeerJeet Wow, how disgusting &amp; appalling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LillaMay Appalling behaviour that might end up cancelling the remainder of the season if it continues. Of all sports, tennis is the 1 that most easily accommodates Covid safety concerns: unless behaviour is grossly irresponsible. So unfair to the many pro tennis players barely getting by.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luciahoff That was absolutely shameful &amp; we could see it happen in real time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luciahoff Yes, although I think the tour is terribly reactive &amp; will plunge ahead &amp; troubleshoot as issues arise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luciahoff @skrebnits I actually don't hope the US Open happens: it's sheer folly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luciahoff It's crazy, moving from surface to surface with no real time in between, but, with the way things are going the US, events are highly questionable there. And Europe might be starting the 2nd wave of Covid in the fall. So doubt this schedule is going to hold.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WannerKev That you have such a graphic just proves my point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WannerKev They're not running to be PM. But you're missing the point: it's the CPC that has always  pointed fingers at dual citizens &amp; those who've worked abroad, suggesting they aren't loyal: Dion, Mulcair, GG Jean &amp; Ignatieff. Also, Scheer never disclosed his dual citizenship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliefox225 @PaulbyJove CPC hounded Dion, Mulcair &amp; GG Jean for their  dual citizenship, suggesting they weren't loyal to Canada &amp; built their entire election campaign around Ignatieff having WORKED in the US. So....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@charliefox225 @PaulbyJove It's our business b/c CPC constantly makes citizenship &amp; proof of patriotism a hot issue to whip up outrage among their base.

<|startoftext|>One positive #coronovirus case should shut down these meat processing plants in Alberta.

<|startoftext|>So Andrew Scheer criticizes Dr. Tam for not being stringent enough vs #COVID19 but wants 4 sittings of Parliament a week?

<|startoftext|>Yves Blanchet makes so much sense - vigilant collaboration is the type of politics Canadians crave &amp; deserve.

<|startoftext|>@barryjcooke1 @signsaresaying @marcel_g Many Canadians don't realize that basically we have 13 different pandemic outbreaks in Canada. Each province &amp; territory at a different point in the curve, with different demographics, socio-economic &amp; cultural conditions, healthcare delivery &amp; epidemic response. We're doing OK!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I haven't seen family in different neighborhoods of Vancouver for over 3 weeks to #FlattenTheCurve.

<|startoftext|>@AndrewScheer Why are you opposed to a virtual House of Commons sitting?

<|startoftext|>Masks or gloves don't protect you; washing your hands &amp; physical distancing do. Wear them to stop spreading your own germs, but know how to put them on &amp; off.

<|startoftext|>@ShawnaGofABPoli @KikkiPlanet @JustinTrudeau I laughed &amp; grimaced as Trudeau did, but as someone learning to do FB Lives, yikes, it's so easy to make vocab gaffes when you draw a blank. It's the biggest limitation to do anything live. Let go of perfectionism!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SunshineList @picardonhealth @CPHO_Canada But it also gives people a false sense of security &amp; they may not exercise appropriate distancing &amp; hygiene, which are way more effective.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SunshineList @picardonhealth @CPHO_Canada And then there are the heaps of masks &amp; gloves people dump on the street - also a potential public health risk. It will take lots of time to educate people on mask &amp; glove culture. But people are imperfect - that's human nature.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SunshineList @picardonhealth @CPHO_Canada There's already guidance on Health Canada &amp; news orgs, plus Dr Tam gave a how-to. Problem is most people don't think there's anything to it &amp; don't access info. Look at how hard it is to teach physical distancing to people &amp; why it's vital.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@picardonhealth @CPHO_Canada And I also saw people take off gloves incorrectly &amp; carry both used gloves &amp; mask in their bare hands. Once they're on outside they must stay on. People are either taking them off or slipping them down to talk, sip coffee &amp; whatever else, all the while thinking they're protected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@picardonhealth @CPHO_Canada The chief problem is that people may not put masks on &amp; off correctly &amp; by touching the mask &amp; not the ear elastic, they run the risk of contaminating themselves, especially if they touch their face right after. I saw this happen while out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perfect #COVID19 advice from @adriandix! It's tempting to break the rules when it's sunny &amp; warm after many months of cold &amp; grey. But we'll shoot ourselves in the foot &amp; have to stay in quarantine much, much longer if we do. #bcpoli #COVID_19<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RobynUrback Humility? This is a global pandemic with science at a gallop, new discoveries, new mistakes, new situations, new anomalies, new obstacles happening every minute of every day. Remember the new in #COVID_19. Perhaps you can show some humility. #COVID19Pandemic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@northernck Well, Alberta is Alberta &amp; it's made a mythology &amp; identity out of oil. It will only change when nobody can deny what the future holds, even the most zealous. But the feds do seem to be wavering on a bailout, given the economics. We can only hope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@northernck The time is now! Supporting oil &amp; gas at a time of rock bottom world prices with a global economy mostly stopped in its tracks doesn't make any economic sense whatsoever. Planning for the future, which is green energy, does. Don't betray workers with false claims about resources.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Taleeb @jjhorgan With good &amp; warmer weather it will be a challenge to keep physical distancing practices going on seawalls, beaches &amp; parks this week. I hope @CityofVancouver &amp; @ParkBoard are prepared to warn &amp; fine those who defy public health orders. Or we'll be in quarantine for way longer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@22minutes was first out of the gate with this one (to my knowledge) but in mere months we've gone from women shouldn't wear face coverings in Quebec to just about everyone everywhere jumping on wearing masks.

<|startoftext|>@ecjacobs The silver lining of this COVID-19 horror show is that Canadians are seeing the high calibre of their chief health officers, their reliance on science &amp; data, at a time when those were considered disposable, their compassion &amp; their great personalities too. They all are so good!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BobRae48 @LeslieMaggie Wouldn't it have been easier, faster &amp; less cumbersome to have done a UBI straight out of the gate? I wonder too about whether the costing would have been more favourable too???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RosieBarton I hate this wretched pandemic with all of my being, but I love seeing you back on @CBCNews quarterbacking all the morning (for me in BC) news conferences &amp; synthesizing the info. Thank you for all you do!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gilmcgowan Thank you. Time to bite the bullet &amp; pivot! Let's give workers funding to learn new skills for green energy &amp; build a stronger, cleaner future. Bailing out oil &amp; gas leaves workers in the lie that it has a future. It only delays the inevitable &amp; greater heartache down the road.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealKiefer I'm so sorry to hear this, Kiefer.

<|startoftext|>@MachadoRedacted @StephanieCarvin @Schtaunkhauser @CBC I've seen so many stories of retired doctors returning to serve only to succumb to COVID-19. So sad - what a calling healthcare is!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MachadoRedacted @StephanieCarvin @Schtaunkhauser @CBC I see. Could there not be some sort of recognition of specific medical schools abroad  as a starting point?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MachadoRedacted @StephanieCarvin @Schtaunkhauser @CBC I wonder too about fast-tracking doctors &amp; nurses who emigrate to or seek asylum in Canada to get their certifications here. It's just a shame to see them on the sidelines now, knowing how desperately they want to help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaxontheCoast @SENYYZ @rolandparis Please remove me from this exchange.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MachadoRedacted @StephanieCarvin @Schtaunkhauser @CBC The #COVID_19 pandemic is exposing how globalization has made us vulnerable in times of crisis. We need to be self-sufficient in medical equipment &amp; PPE: that's the easy lesson so far. Truly tragic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theslimdude @NoLore I don't know; the point I was trying to make is that Amazon does fulfillment &amp; Canada Post doesn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theslimdude @NoLore I believe that CP has the larger share &amp; the only one delivering to PO boxes. But whatever! 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@britjpncdn @MaxontheCoast @SENYYZ @rolandparis They are planning by taking in the different needs of each province &amp; territory.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaxontheCoast @SENYYZ @rolandparis The data is imperfect any which way: it's modeling. All of this skirts the fact that we will have to do physical distancing for a few months &amp; if everyone buys in &amp; follows this advice we can flatten the curve. That's what is vital. Not probability charts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveCoville @Rpbotniks @bruce_arthur Yes, Dr. Henry, BC's Health Officer, said yesterday that provinces are using different data protocols, some didn't even have enough data to model until recently &amp; each province &amp; territory are at a different point on the pandemic curve, making national reporting very difficult.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SENYYZ @whiskyczar @rolandparis @nspector4 Also, some provinces &amp; territories didn't even have enough data to start modeling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaxontheCoast @SENYYZ @rolandparis Provinces have been using different data &amp; modeling tools, as BC's Dr. Henry said yesterday, as well as pointing out each province is at a different point in the disease curve. So it's very difficult to come up with national forecasting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theslimdude @NoLore Most Amazon packages are delivered by CP; some addresses are delivered by other services - it depends on location - according to Google.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theslimdude @NoLore They gave an arrangement with Canada Post. All of the Amazon packages I've received from them has been via CP, as an example.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoLore @SHDChristineB @Rabnew Because Canada Post says so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@virtuous_sloth @NoLore Yes, Canada Post delivers packages; it doesn't fulfill orders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoLore @theslimdude Canada Post is a delivery service not a fulfillment one. They will likely deliver these supplies.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mrdruthers @AndrewScheer That was draft legislation leaked by the CPC &amp; not in context, as apparently there were restrictions on what kind of economic power was envisaged.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@althiaraj Yes. And going forward post-pandemic under a certain income level. Would lift so many people, especially women, giving them re-training opportunities &amp; making labour more skilled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mtnbvan So awful. We were supposed to visit family in 3 weeks time. 😥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mtnbvan Oh, I follow many virologists. I have family in Spain. A complete lockdown is impossible. Flattening the curve &amp; hopefully planking the curve will allow space for healthcare to treat COVID-19 patients who require urgent care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mtnbvan I understood that she was referring to the impossible extreme of each individual being in one's own bubble for two straight weeks. That would indeed stop the virus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eugenegu Canadian here. Can private healthcare &amp; clinics be brought on to help fight #COVIDー19? Spain, for example, nationalized private hospitals &amp; clinics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scribulatora YES,  THIS!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewScheer @mrdruthers You know @AndrewScheer I'm all for cross-party collaboration &amp; suggestions for best practices &amp; health &amp; economic protections for all Cdns as we navigate a global pandemic necessitating a WWII response, but partisanship &amp; cheap political shots don't help.

<|startoftext|>@charlesadler So do grocery clerks. My young goddaughter, who works part-time as one, returned home from a long shift completely stressed out due to rude customers.

<|startoftext|>Fascinating how some reporters, not @althiaraj BTW, desperately want a worst case scenario projection of deaths. That figure might make great click bait headlines. But do Canadians really need it to get their act together &amp; move inside? Are we blind to Italy &amp; Spain? #StayAtHome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngelaSterritt It's also the by-product of staying indoors: colds spread more easily in closed quarters &amp; indoor air can dry out the sinuses, making it easier to catch viruses.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And who are our essential workers, besides our valiant healthcare workers &amp; first responders? Grocery store &amp; pharmacy clerks, postal workers, delivery drivers, custodians, city workers, truckers...many of whom just make minimum wage, no benefits &amp; forget about a pension plan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And senior &amp; elder care aides aren't paid sufficiently so they are forced to work in several nursing homes or assisted living residences to earn a living wage &amp; thus increase the risk of #COVID19 community spread in an extremely vulnerable population.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>making pandemic management even more difficult, costing lives &amp; putting healthcare workers at undue risk. While the treatment of seniors in care facilities may be well-meaning in most, the truth is there aren't enough qualified staffing or investment for decent quality of life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#COVID_19 is giving us a harsh lesson of where we are as a country in relation to our values by exposing vulnerabilities in our society &amp; economy. Globalization has made most countries dependent on too few sources for medical equipment &amp; PPE, making pandemic management difficult,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorbertElekes How?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rodmickleburgh That's awesome!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BobRae48 We need to also examine globalization risks re the supply of medical equipment &amp; PPE. We're not self-sufficient, nor are US &amp; EU etc. We're all after the same supply. This is leading to huge gaps in healthcare delivery, endangering health workers &amp; leads to unnecessary casualties<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@shaunmclean I can't imagine why anyone would travel, now or a month ago. Why did those doctors in Alberta go to that curling event? Or the dentists go to the Vancouver conference weeks ago? It boggles the mind. People never think #COVID_19 could happen to them. But it can. #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunmclean Sadly this is human nature. People need time to change their behaviour &amp; attitudes. Also, air &amp; rail would have to train personnel, develop procedures &amp; put in place policing authorities as well, if people resisted being rejected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think of reactions of Canadians if fed govt &amp; provinces clamped down on travel &amp; social restrictions, elimination of non-essential work &amp; imposing self-isolation all at once weeks ago? Without a public understanding of the gravity of #COVID_19? This is the crux of policy devt!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some journos question the gradual rollout of travel &amp; crowd restrictions across Canada &amp; provinces, suggesting the experience of other #COVID_19 countries showed us we should have done this weeks ago. But, sadly, public policy is rolled out this way to ensure public compliance.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tufftitmouse @kenklippenstein Yes, I think so too. Trump is using #COVID_19 to justify militarization of US borders, but his interest is obviously to do what he has always wanted to do, which is to wall off Mexico. It's just cover.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ldobsonhughes Agree! I'm glad you raised the topic; it's important to understand our cultural reactions to critical situations.

<|startoftext|>@Scribulatora @StephanieCarvin @cforcese My guess is Trump is using the #CoronavirusPandemic as cover for consolidating borders.

<|startoftext|>Here's an example of how the power to #FlattenTheCurve is with you. Not the government, not the hospitals, not the scientists. YOU!

<|startoftext|>@CPHO_Canada Reports of returning Canadians masking symptoms to get on flights or not complying with self-isolation on return are alarming. With over 1 million back already, shouldn't the Quarantine Act be enacted to enforce compliance &amp; prevent an exponential #COVID19 increase?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kady I definitely wouldn't call the last 48 hours as a shining example of Canadian politics. Just ask the millions of Canadians who can't pay rent April 1st. Or groceries. Gamemanship on all sides &amp; again the BQ emerges as the voice of reason.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IAmCHAP24 You can bike alone but you need to keep social distance - at least 6 feet away from anyone when you're outside. Stay home &amp; stay safe!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just when you thought there might be some sense &amp; sensibility in current Canadian politics, suddenly we're back to pride &amp; prejudice, forcing Canadians to use persuasion on social media to get MPs to #PassTheDamnBill so they can eat &amp; pay rent. #cdnpoli #COVIDCanada #JaneAusten<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really appalling behaviour. People need financial help, healthcare workers need PPE, hospitals need testing &amp; supplies, cities &amp; businesses need support.

<|startoftext|>A pox on all politicians playing politics at the expense of the lives they're supposed to represent &amp; while collecting their paycheques when people are losing their jobs, health &amp; homes. You'd think a global pandemic would motivate our so-called leaders to put aside partisanship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With Liberal overreach, which has now introduced politics into how Canada manages #COVIDー19, possibly delaying benefits to Canadians, perhaps it's best to give a #UBI to speed support up &amp; avoid bureaucracy. @Bill_Morneau #cdnpoli @joycemurray @JustinTrudeau @cafreeland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also can't believe no one in Cabinet questioned this? Truly strange. Is pandemic modelling telling them something we should know? Do they forsee medical issues with MPs &amp; Senators?

<|startoftext|>Can't believe the govt dropped the ball so massively in their tax overreach, withering away cooperation among all parties &amp; Canadians may end up paying the price &amp; not get the economic supports they need NOW.

<|startoftext|>Returning snowbirds &amp; Canadians from abroad: you must go home DIRECTLY once you cross the border or arrive at the airport. Don't take public transit or stop for groceries.

<|startoftext|>There's a certain hashtag on Twitter Canada that has no business trending. Our PM &amp; cabinet have been doing a great job in trying circumstances.

<|startoftext|>@asifintoronto In Vancouver the weather has been nice &amp; young people have been on the beaches, mingling in small groups, even young families picnicking. Sigh. No cops around to warn &amp; disperse. But in summer there are packs of them on ATVs making sure there's no public drinking on the beach.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunmclean @EmilyLazatin @PattyHajdu It's coming soon, I bet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JanetBrown980 @vanreport @CKNW @GlobalBC @CUrquhartGlobal @jarmstrongbc @kennedystewart @adriandix @DrBonnieHenry The city has to get really serious with this: why can't cops on horseback or bikes patrol beaches &amp; parks? People think having a picnic with family or friends is social distancing. @CityofVancouver @ParkBoard @VancouverPD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunmclean @EmilyLazatin @PattyHajdu Canada has ramped up, though much more is needed. At this point, what is vital to flatten the curve is self-isolation. There are too many not doing it &amp; too many who think COVID-19 won't affect them. It's the single thing we can all do that has the most effect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunmclean @EmilyLazatin @PattyHajdu Well, first it's the test itself which is slow, then the lab space capable of running them &amp; verifying results. Apparently there's a new test which is simpler &amp; has just a 30 minute turnaround, so hopefully that ramps up &amp; becomes available.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@zzawaideh @shawnmicallef Exactly - make an exception for trucking &amp; commercial traffic &amp; essential workers.

<|startoftext|>@poli_nerd @pop2cas @StephanieCarvin @supriyadwivedi Yes, it's harder. Closing it won't be perfect either, given the distance. But it needs to be done a.s.a.p.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephanieCarvin @supriyadwivedi Well, all of Europe is shut down now. With Washington State's timebomb next door, I don't know why Canada is waiting for what's to come.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OK, it's time to close the border to US citizens now. Yes, our economies are integrated, but trucking &amp; commerce can be exempted. US will be #COVID19 epicentre for Canada in days. Let's not wait for tomorrow. @JustinTrudeau @CPHO_Canada @PattyHajdu @joycemurray #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephanieCarvin @supriyadwivedi But those people crossing have to self-isolate for 14 days, so isn't that limiting the flow anyway? Definitely the length of the border is always going to be somewhat porous anyway, but the US will become the #COVID19 epicentre in a few days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephanieCarvin @supriyadwivedi Couldn't you keep the border open to Canadian citizens &amp; residents &amp; truckers to keep the supply chain going?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm also flummoxed by people hoarding toilet paper, emptying shelves of rice, pasta &amp; frozen food &amp; then going out to bars &amp; restaurants where everybody is packed like sardines. Please don't mess with supply chains &amp; practice #SocialDistancing! It works! #COVID19 #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's intriguing &amp; slightly amusing to see conservatives who always complain about the nanny state &amp; say govts should get out of the way of the individual, pivot completely w #coronavirus &amp; complain it isn't doing enough to with signage, curtailing mobility &amp; forcing quarantine.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pattibacchus The problem other jurisdictions have had is with travel. Since BC has recommended against all travel, including to US, the hope is they'll prevent families returning with #COVID19 as has happened in Quebec &amp; Ontario.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mattgood Many condolences, Matt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Canadian response to #coronavirus has been stellar so far.

<|startoftext|>@christoaivalis @theJagmeetSingh @jjhorgan The fact is that the NDP is all over the map when it comes to environmental, labour &amp; indigenous issues. And the RCMP in this case was a BC provincial force.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@frgetit @VassyKapelos @PnPCBC We all feel for this person, his predicament &amp; frustration of feeling so helpless with his wife &amp; stepdaughter in Wuhan, but they are Chinese citizens.

<|startoftext|>@keithbaldrey During Trudeau's presser with Trump yesterday, the President of the US facing impeachment called Adam Schiff "a maniac", "a deranged human being", "a very sick man".

<|startoftext|>@stphnmaher And why women were so worried about abortion rights during the federal campaign, while male pundits &amp; politicians kept saying that it was a done deal &amp; raising the issue was a case of distraction politics by progressive parties.

<|startoftext|>@Alex_Panetta Peak language politics crazy. Quebec will lose many more much needed valuable &amp; skilled immigrants because of its racist Bill 21, values test &amp; restrictions on international students getting their PRs. Distinct society, indeed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quebec will lose out on the skilled immigrants it badly needs with Bill 21, its new values test, restrictions on its fast-tracked immigrations program for students &amp; a clamp-down on English services.

<|startoftext|>And ditto with W. Brett Wilson, who says hateful &amp; vile things on Twitter &amp; deals in disinformation: stop amplifying his voice, media!

<|startoftext|>MSM loves the "Canada has never been more divided" trope Conservative premiers peddle, everyone forgetting decades of Quebec separatism &amp; being on the referendum ropes twice; Wexit founders have far-right, racists views, begging the question why media is giving them a platform.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here are some truths that should be obvious, but in this dysfunctional digital landscape seem to be lost: Russia is actively using Wexit (&amp; this does sound like Elmer Fudd's party) to sow seeds of division in Canada. Let's not fall for this! #cdnpoli #cdnmedia #Russia #meddling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RosieBarton May is so right: all the talk about fringe Wexit (BC resents this label) while the biggest threat to our existence, to our planet gets swept under the rug. At our peril.

<|startoftext|>@robshaw_vansun @Dave_Eby Awesome response from my MLA!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Garossino You need to have full or near-full participation on your street to have a decent number of trick or treaters. You could have the best decorations in the world but if you're the only one or one of few, kids won't show. Gotta max out Halloween - it's all strategic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sewart @AndrewScheer Also, it's Gwyn Morgan who steered SNC's ship during its worst corruption, so....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewScheer Encana started this process under your watch, CPC!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Sidebar to Jason: if you think you're going to be electable as CPC leader to PM with this type of divisive &amp; regionalist playbook - the populist politics of anger &amp; fear - you're sadly mistaken. You lost every riding you campaign for this federal election outside Alberta. #Kenney<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jason Kenney is less erratic than Twitter Trump, although his motives of whipping up his base in the same. Morning Jason threatens to leave Canada. Afternoon Jason says Alberta is Canada. Are you in or out, Alberta? #cdnpoli #JasonKenney #abpoli #bcpoli<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PnPCBC really amazing how power panel talks about the West, TMX pipeline, the NDP's climate position &amp; its election results without one single reference to BC. Alberta NDP doesn't like Singh's position on TMX, but BC did &amp; guess what, they got seats to prove it! #cdnpoli #bcpoli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We need to learn how to work with each other in a spirit of collaboration, rational debate, empathy &amp; love. This is the Canada we want: a just &amp; diverse society. #cdnpoli #ElectionResults2019 #LPC #CPC #NDP #GPC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I certainly hope police will find &amp; arrest the culprit who defaced @cathmckenna office on whatever charges that apply: hate, public mischief etc. After the vitriol of political discourse in recent years, peaking in #elx43 we need to reset society. #ClimateChange #ClimateCrisis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The neo-con, far right cesspool of hate &amp; misogyny is flourishing in Canada. It's disgusting what politicians, leaders &amp; changemakers have to put up with to do their work, which serves society. @cathmckenna now needs a security detail; is this a Canada we want? #cdnmedia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulvieira @RobertFife @CTVNews Ralph Goodale would be great &amp; super helpful in the PMO to clear house &amp; increase dialogue with caucus &amp; all MPs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Atlantic Canada lost most of its fisheries; Ontario manufacturing; Quebec asbestos &amp; many corporate headquarters; BC forestry &amp; soon salmon. The North? Everything: its entire way of life. We all have to adapt to radically changing times &amp; diversify. Wake up! #cdnpoli #CPC #wexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just a few reminders for Western Conservatives: in 2000 Stephen Harper suggested Alberta put up a firewall to prevent federal intervention &amp; in 2005 he called Atlantic Canada "a culture of defeat". Enough pointing fingers &amp; blaming. Reality bites.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@politicalham @ianjamesyoung70 This is awesome, Ian!! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CraigCoolahan @jkenney Definitely using Alberta to unseat Scheer &amp; become leader of the CPC. Kenney wasn't in witness protection like Doug Ford was &amp; an outsider would have thought he was Ontario premier during the campaign. Also, now he can start cutting services in Alberta, just like Ford.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glen_mcgregor @chuddles11 Hahaha!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VassyKapelos Terry Beach voted against the TMX expansion, which probably saved his seat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Scheer &amp; Canadian political talking heads have to add the Liberal, NDP, BQ, Green &amp; Independent votes to understand that progressives are by far the dominant voice across the country. #cdnpoli #elxn43 #ScheerlessTuesday #minoritygovernment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amylieberfarb How dreadful. Thinking of you all.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RMComedy Your commentary last night was fantastic - eager to learn more about your work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Canada is not the divided political landscape pundits go on about. Yesterday's results show progressives are by far the majority voice; it also shows that Conservatives largely are shut out of urban centres, so much of the schism is a rural-urban one. Let's dump toxic rhetoric!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vancouver, let's welcome Greta Thunberg &amp; remind our newly elected politicians that climate change is the biggest issue of our times.

<|startoftext|>@vansk24 @keithbaldrey Yup! So sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrPollon2 @charlesadler By far much less on the left. This is coming from the normalization of Rebel Media, True North, Yellow Vests &amp; other right-wing movements tied with white nationalism. Note that Hamish Marshall, a co-founder of Rebel Media, is Andrew Scheer's campaign manager.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrPollon2 @charlesadler It really is the far-right manipulation of facts &amp; use of bots &amp; trolls to stir up hate. It's disgusting &amp; scary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayJanower @RugbyCanada This is the remedy to all the toxicity out there on social media! Thanks for sharing &amp; happy Thanksgiving!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brianlilley @JustinTrudeau Maybe you need to follow other journalists who actually do the work, not your lazy social media incentivizing of right-wing trolls &amp; bots. @MercedesGlobal has all the details but I'm sure you're not interested in facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Read this thread. We are in a time where there is no truth, nor facts; everything is a cascade of  conspiracies. How wretched &amp; sad. Where is heart: where is compassion; where is kindness? #cdnpoli #elx43 #media<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MrPollon2 @charlesadler It's not conflation; it's beside the point. It was an observation he made at the time; considered deflection then.

<|startoftext|>@JulieSLalonde The hate &amp; threats again Trudeau on social media is pathological. And media has sat on the rise of alt-right movements in Canada. And here it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RosieBarton You've earned it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glen_mcgregor Not surprised, sadly, given all the hate &amp; threats towards Trudeau on social media. Rise of the alt-right &amp; a blind eye by most media on Rebel Media, Yellow Vests &amp; Proud movements has brought Canada to this point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CPC_HQ So more bureaucracy - what happened to the shrinking cubicle promise?? Blue ribbon salaries to 'research' the obvious - stop government handouts to oil &amp; gas companies. Oh, but Elections Canada is investigating you colluding with them during the campaign, so I guess not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewScheer Great! Cutting oil &amp; gas subsidies will save massive amounts of money that can go into green energy &amp; worker retraining. 🤗 #elxn43 #cdnpoli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LOL, the @CPC_HQ platform big idea of shrinking cubicle space for public servants to save money &amp; at the same time creating another  bureaucratic commission to oversee corporate subsidies - no doubt blue ribbon salaries for blue ribbon ex-politicos. #ScheerCuts #cdnpoli #elxn43<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, @CPC_HQ has vowed to cut corporate welfare, so that means no more oil &amp; gas subsidies, right? #cdnpoli #elx43 #Scheer #bcpoli #abpoli #ClimateCrisis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey #bcpoli, the @CPC_HQ platform  that freezes infrastructure investments means that the Skytrain extensions to UBC &amp; Langley may not happen as they rely on federal funding. Voter &amp; commuter beware! #cdnpoli #elxn43 #ScheerCuts #Vancouver #vanpoli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CPC &amp; @AndrewScheer's campaign of disinformation &amp; lies continue, targeting Chinese-Canadians in Ontario &amp; BC. This is the Trump playbook &amp; what Rebel Media's Hamish Marshall has brought to the Conservative campaign. #cdnpoli #elxn43 #Scheer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FBoivinGatineau @AndrewScheer It's hilarious, as well as the odd positioning of the flag. Scheer in front of driftwood is a great metaphor though... #cdnpoli #elxn43<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@VoiceOfFranky Not surprised as Bernier per his debate performance appeals to true fiscal conservatives, as Scheer is supporting deficits. That was a critical moment in the debate when Bernier said he was the only one pledging to get government out of the red &amp; out of corporate subsidies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fake news has been a big player in #elxn43 with Scheer's Conservatives an active participant. Keep your Spidey senses on alert for more dirty tricks from campaign war rooms, fake news sites, bots &amp; former political hacks with an axe to grind. #cdnpoli #CPC #Media<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewScheer HOW? HOW? HOW? CPC has NO platform yet! Canadians are already voting, so there's one promise you've made that's already a lie. You have contempt for voters if you think your lies, memes &amp; empty promises are worthy of office. #cdnpoli #elxn43 #Scheer<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ianhanomansing Um, sorely tempted to make a snide remark but...high road!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's disgusting that @CPC_HQ insists on spreading lies &amp; disinformation but no surprise considering that Rebel Media cofounder Hamish Marshall is @AndrewScheer's campaign manager. Conservatives are complicit in spreading fake news. #cdnpoli #elxn43<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PattiVeeTee @RobertFife You're point is? May &amp; Singh were the winners of the debate. Whether or not they can win is beside the point. Also, we have a multi-party system &amp; should vote according to our beliefs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really shameful that #leadersdebate2019 didn't have a foreign policy segment. The world is a very messy &amp; scary place with  superpowers fading &amp; others rising; traditional allies rupturing; &amp; schisms in Europe. And we have no idea how our leaders would respond. #cdnpoli #elxn43<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ARTofHope I feel so sorry for progressives in Alberta; almost impossible to break through the Conservative chokehold.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertFife Scheer was awful &amp; mostly insignificant until the end when he woke up a bit. Trudeau largely unscathed, but May outstanding &amp; Singh passionate &amp; witty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ARTofHope So sad &amp; frustrating that it is. It's a distinct society. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ARTofHope Thanks for the follow back! 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ARTofHope Yes, I think it would - outside Alberta.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big fail #CanadaDebates2019 had Indigenous segment before Energy/Climate Change: it was almost completely highjacked by TMX pipeline. Good May &amp; Singh brought it back to vital questions. Scheer's get energy consultations with indigenous "out of the way" speaks volumes.#elxn43<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ARTofHope Given that neither Singh nor May can form government<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ARTofHope Agree! Liberal minority with Singh &amp; May as coalition partners would be great!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ARTofHope Singh did the best emo-wise; May the best for policy &amp; actually answering questions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ARTofHope My thoughts too! That's all Scheer did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PnPCBC isn't this debate about Central Canada? #leadersdebate2019 starts &amp; ends before most British Columbians get home from work. #cdnpoli #elxn43 #bcpoli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently @CPC_HQ had to import a candidate to #VancouverQuadra from Alberta, so no surprise Kathleen Dixon is incredulous...about climate being the most issue facing us today &amp; well, feminism. Just a reminder, it's 2019 in BC, Kathleen! #cdnpoli #bcpoli #vanpoli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The @CPC_HQ has always been loose with the truth on social media, but this election they've been particularly shameless &amp; Tea Partyish with outright lies on carbon tax &amp; now capital gains tax on housing. #cdnpoli #elxn43 #debate #leadersdebate2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, heading into federal #leadersdebate2019 @CPC_HQ still hasn't released a full platform, costed or otherwise, &amp; Canadians are already voting on university campuses.

<|startoftext|>Also, different from other cities in Canada, happy to see @VancouverPD are playing hockey with @ExtinctionR protesters on Burrard Bridge. Big props! 🏒🥅 #vanpoli #Vancouver #cdnpoli #elxn43 #bcpoli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sigh. @CBCNews doing a domestic &amp; international arrest report on @ExtinctionR demonstrations instead of talking about why demonstrators are blocking bridges &amp; interviewing protesters. Only Halifax @Brett_CBC talking issues. #cdnpoli #ClimateAction<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevinmilligan I'm sure @CBCNews &amp; other networks will have it available for streaming afterwards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rolandparis It's been a horrible, wretched campaign that has turned voters off. You can't tell that we're in the middle of an election campaign in my riding.

<|startoftext|>So, advance polling for #elx43 starts  today &amp; there's no @CPC_HQ platform, costed or otherwise? #cdnpoli #ScheerNotAsAdvertised #ScheerDisaster<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@retirement08 @JJ_McCullough Oh, I don't care at all - the issue is that Harper said you couldn't be dual &amp; the Conservatives ripped Dion, Jean &amp; Mulcair apart over it &amp; made Ignatieff out to be unpatriotic for working abroad. It's the Scheer hypocrisy of it all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaylorCtaylor67 @marlenejennings @JJ_McCullough I agree - it's a horrible election campaign<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaylorCtaylor67 @marlenejennings @JJ_McCullough I don't care myself; it has been the CPC themselves who have made it a big deal over the years, raking Dion, Mulcair &amp; Jean over the coals for their dual citizenships &amp; Ignatieff simply for working abroad for many years. Scheers had 20.years to renounce. It's CPC hypocrisy, again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TaylorCtaylor67 @marlenejennings @JJ_McCullough When she became Canadian decades ago, US immigration law was different &amp; didn't allow dual citizenship with any country, so you had to renounce it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So far this week, Canadians have learned that Andrew Scheer fudged his resume, lied about being a broker, hid his dual citizenship...what else will drop? Clearly Scheer is not as advertised. #ScheerHypocrisy #ScheerLies #cdnpoli #elxn43<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nspector4 That's about 15 years late, if it was a political issue for Scheer &amp; CPC.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ALIJSHPL @RobertFife @CPC_HQ It's not even an issue for me, but @CPC_HQ made it one &amp; made it seem unpatriotic &amp; unsuiitable for political leaders. Scheer hypocrisy. What else is he fudging? #ScheerNotAsAdvertised #cdnpoli #elx43 #Scheer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ALIJSHPL @RobertFife @CPC_HQ Igmatieff is Canadian only but was maligned for working abroad. Scheer disguised his dual nationality all this time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertFife Dion, Ignatieff &amp; Mulcair should get public apologies ftom Scheer &amp; @CPC_HQ after they eviscerated them for not being true Canadians #cdnpoli #elx43<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CPC_HQ You used to be high school; now you're kindergarten. What an embarrassment of a political party @CPC_HQ you are! You got derogatory memes &amp; nothing else. No policy, no ideas, no class. #cdnpoli #elx43 #bcpoli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusanDelacourt Finally! Values are the core of all human activity. These questions reveal the real face of politicians, policy &amp; agendas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All the federal leaders, except @ElizabethMay are afraid of saying what Bill 21 is: discrimination. Afraid because of vote-rich Quebec. Irony note: today Quebec issued an apology to indigenous peoples for generations of systemic discrimination. Racism? It's here in Canada. #TVA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let that sink in. We praise @theJagmeetSingh for his firm, yet polite response here (again). But why should he deal with this at all? His turban dings his chances of electoral success in Quebec. #elx43<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Make no mistake: Quebec's Bill 21 secularism law prohibiting public servants from wearing religious symbols will open the floodgates for up-to-now closet racists attacking &amp; othering Canadians who do so. @theJagmeetSingh wouldn't be allowed to be a teacher in Montreal. #cdnpoli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpezNc @VoiceOfFranky I found this so interesting &amp; am eager to learn more about this urban-semiurban-rural divide.  https://t.co/V5JITC8Ed7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VoiceOfFranky @SpezNc Isn't the split more a rural-urban one rather than an Alberta/Prairie one vs ROC?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RosieBarton Excellent format that minimizes political spin &amp; actually fosters deeper conversations on issues, without the tiresome partisanship. Thank you, Rosie!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alex_Panetta Plus the look is so bad when leaders try to avoid, bend or spin their way out of an answer. I bet this series will be more informative than the debates.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alex_Panetta It was excellent! Super, heart-felt questions with a desire for deep conversation. So much better than the debate format; no talking-over &amp; restricts the spin from leaders.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Western premiers, especially Jason Kenney, stir the pot of regional discontent &amp; Conservative populism, but the real Liberal-Conservative divide is an urban-rural one across the country. #cdnpoli #elx43<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Justin_Ling Thanks for doing this - I was looking forward to your summary!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @AndrewScheer do you offer climate change insurance? You know, for floods, wildfires, tornadoes, landslides, etc? Or are all those Acts of God &amp; you won't cover them? #ScheeringTheResume #cdnpoli #elxn43 #ClimateAction<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BobRae48 Not really; not protecting the environment &amp; not believing in #ClimateAction is the CPC brand.

<|startoftext|>BC has had double the Canadian average of job growth in the last 4.5 years. Carbon tax for the win! When you go to the polls, go with facts, not party disinformation. Carbon taxes work. Full stop. #cdnpoli #elxn43 #bcpoli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still flummoxed why @PnPCBC includes Christy Clark on their ex-Premiers panel.

<|startoftext|>@DrJenGunter @CBC  https://t.co/tv7pySYm1M<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Leaders applauding #GretaThunberg's angry speech, decrying promises of perpetual economic expansion over action to prevent a global climate crisis, obviously didn't get it.

<|startoftext|>@Justin_Ling Singh is warming up now &amp; is doing better. Scheer is totally flat-footed &amp; has made clear he has no policy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>"Legislated discrimination," thank you @theJagmeetSingh for strongly opposing Quebec's Bill 21, the secularism bill that outlaws public servants from wearing religious symbols at work. #cdnpoli #elxn43 #firstdebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's really sort of brilliant Trudeau isn't there in real politik terms as both Elizabeth May &amp; Jagmeet Singh are hitting on Scheer as if he's the govt &amp; forcing him to go beyond talking points, which he doesn't. All he says is "it's not true". #cdnpoli #firstdebate #elxn43<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What are you doing about it @JustinTrudeau @AndrewScheer @theJagmeetSingh @ElizabethMay? #ClimateCrisis #ClimateChange #cdnpoli #elx43 #Election2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Climate change is a fact. With it, a future of mass climate change refugees at our doors, a loss of food security, from dwindling fisheries to the end of species, extreme weather events of fire, floods, drought, erosion... In short it's the greatest security threat of our times.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ianhanomansing Not extraordinary enough. A weak apology to a hate piece that should never have seen the light of day but landed on thousands of people's doorsteps today.

<|startoftext|>@cathmckenna It's absolutely abhorrent what you &amp; your family put up with 24/7. Toxic masculinity is rampant, especially in conservative &amp; right-wing organizations.

<|startoftext|>I sure don't want a penny of taxpayer money supporting US-owned Postmedia, who made their far-right face known yet again today. They must be relegated to the Rebel Media trash heap. There's no room here in Canada for this hateful crap. #cdnpoli #vancouversun<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sorry for the many excellent journalists trying to work in this era of media conglomerates.

<|startoftext|>@Samana_Siddiqui @MazMHussain @rolandparis In that they are also engaged or at least more interested in heritage politics than other ethnic communities. Newer Chinese immigrants as well perhaps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MazMHussain @Samana_Siddiqui @rolandparis The Indo-Canadian community might be an exception to this. And the other worrisome aspect is how CPC is trying to influence Chinese-Canadians.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rolandparis These are extremely challenging, complex times, with the geopolitical chessboard radically shifting. Canadians need &amp; deserve reporting to match, so we learn how to be a player successfully navigating this dangerous game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rolandparis Absolutely agree. The poor reporting of foreign affairs is a mix of all the issues you highlighted, with the addition news organizations have simplified all issues to Gr 6 level, thinking that's what we want in this attention-challenged era.

If you choose to remain in your silo &amp; ignore the evidence, that's your choice. But look around you &amp; see. Extreme weather events, wildfires, floods: it's here now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JPM2019 It's not absurd. It's not fearmongering. It's science. It's evidence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JPM2019 Climate change is the biggest threat to national &amp; global security. It's almost too late to stop it; certainly Canada's piecemeal approach is taking is doing little, so adaptation is the direction all govt levels must take. If you're uncomfortable now, just wait for what's coming<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AndrewScheer A laughable, milquetoast, nothing statement.

<|startoftext|>@Garossino It's climate; it's the immense frustration that traditional parties aren't acting with urgency &amp; imagination on today's critical challenges.

<|startoftext|>@AndreGrondin88 @marilyn28970731 @MeanwhileinCana @JustinTrudeau BC's economic growth has been above the national average since 2014 &amp; has the lowest unemployment in the country. Our cost of living is high due to housing costs &amp; this market is being corrected with legislation curbing speculation. Yes, even weak Paris targets aren't being met.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndreGrondin88 @marilyn28970731 @MeanwhileinCana @JustinTrudeau The BC Liberal party isn't affiliated with the LPC &amp; is an umbrella party of Social Credit, Conservatives &amp; Liberals &amp; leans right.

<|startoftext|>@AndreGrondin88 @marilyn28970731 @MeanwhileinCana @JustinTrudeau It changes the behaviour of consumers &amp; producers. We've had carbon taxes in BC for over 10 years (brought in by con leaning party) &amp; are leading Canada in economic growth. Paris targets are same as Harper's &amp; are weak. If Cda has issues dealing with those, we're in big trouble.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kris_sims @inky_mark @curiosguy66 But projections are only a 20% increase in gas in that scenario. Also at the mercy of producers who are more interested in export.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndreGrondin88 @MeanwhileinCana @marilyn28970731 @JustinTrudeau Geothermal, solar, wind energy projects are alive &amp; kicking in Canada. The renewable energy sector is going to grow fast because it has to; it needs skilled workers. What's your data on unemployed university grads in Ontario?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeanwhileinCana @marilyn28970731 @JustinTrudeau That's my bet &amp; perhaps we'd see less of the rise of right wing populism too. It's not too late for Canada to have a green deal, but it is harder with so many entrenched in their ideological silos. Now even the underwhelming Liberal climate change program seems unattainable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WoodfordCHNL It's annoying to see the numbers of Alberta fingers pointing at TMX as solving BC's gas problems, though the bitumen is meant for export &amp; the old pipe would only give BC 20% more gas if producers allow it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeanwhileinCana @marilyn28970731 @JustinTrudeau Wonder what would have happened if the Liberals had the bold plan you suggest right out of the gate, shifting O&amp;G subsidies to retraining, geothermal (already doable), solar (now working in rain!) &amp; electric infrastructure &amp; where we'd be now politically &amp; economically.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeanwhileinCana @marilyn28970731 @JustinTrudeau Agree, &amp; given the polarized discourse in Canada, necessary. Let's include retraining programs &amp; education tax credits to all sectors of the economy threatened by climate change to accelerate transition into sustainability. Our social cohesion is at risk. #justsociety #cdnpoli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kamorant @MeanwhileinCana @marilyn28970731 @JustinTrudeau We're talking about shifting govt focus away from oil &amp; into green energy as a transition to a sustainable economy. Yes, resource co's have a responsibility to employees (bigger players already shifting into renewables) but whether or how far they'll go investing in staff is ??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidakin @stphnmaher Maybe that's why he's leaving?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeanwhileinCana @marilyn28970731 @JustinTrudeau Oil &amp; gas subsidy $$ should go to oilsands workers as well for retraining in green energy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BestStephen @theslimdude @CNN @CTVNews @CBCNews @RosieBarton The ratio @CBCNews of interviews with pro-pipeline politicians, pundits, Indigenous &amp; economists vs anti TMX of the same grouping certainly doesn't reflect the discourse on the ground &amp; obviously in BC in particular.

<|startoftext|>@BestStephen @theslimdude @CNN @CTVNews @CBCNews @RosieBarton If anybody had the time &amp;/or the stomach for it, it would be interesting to see the number of times Maxime Bernier has appeared on @CBCNews shows vs Elizabeth May.

<|startoftext|>@BestStephen @theslimdude @CNN @CTVNews @CBCNews @RosieBarton I've noticed this too, although this doesn't apply to their mini docs or feature TV (i.e. Nature of Things) or radio where journalists aren't on a leash.

<|startoftext|>@jacksonleon9 @jkenney I understood the original was not going to be exclusively earmarked for refined - but whatever best suits market conditions. In any case, it won't make for a substantial increase in refined oil for Lower Mainland use.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jacksonleon9 @jkenney Because TMX is mostly for export markets predominantly US - Washington &amp; California - where they have gave refinery capacity for bitumen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jkenney Um, no. It doesn't work that way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BNSim @AGMacDougall @macleans Yoy realize that goes for all parties?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wildling7 @Garossino Yes, though SNC threats to move offices to US &amp; sell off divisions were revealed this week.

<|startoftext|>@AndrewNixon @Bandreescu_ @TSNTennis Rarely see WTA on TV, except for tourneys like Rogers Cup (naturally) or Grand Slams. At least they broadcast FedCup now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewNixon @Bandreescu_ @TSNTennis Pardon my cynicism, but as a woman I don't share your optimism about networks wanting to develop or filling a demand for women's sports.

<|startoftext|>@AndrewNixon @TennisCanada @Bandreescu_ @TSNTennis The WTA doesn't seem to do a very good job selling broadcasting rights in general. Or are networks not interested?

<|startoftext|>Unfortunate that Elizabeth May gets so few minutes to ask questions at Justice Government because she asks the real nitty gritty ones that get to heart of the issue. And she is still asking fantastic ones in her presser now. Very impressive! #just #cdnpoli #SNCLavalin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Justice Committee must recall Jody Wilson Raybould to answer questions raised by Gerald Butts testimony, as well as Cabinet shuffle which she wasn't able to address. Curious why she never documented her decision &amp; why Butts didn't know what his staff heard from JWR #just #cdnpoli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rolandparis So unfortunate that Liberal majority on Justice Committee voted against the two motions to get texts of those involved &amp; getting JWR to return. We're getting nowhere this way. @joycemurray<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joycemurray Apparently David Lametti has sought an outside opinion on SNC?? The Liberals can't be serious about going ahead with a DPA?????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewScheer LOL, you're kidding, right?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@calmecam It also goes to the question of expectations Canadians have regarding government involvement in the economy to protect jobs &amp; pensions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@calmecam Indeed!!! I suspect not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Garossino @cafreeland It could be her truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the 50 shades of grey area of government relations with industry &amp; their lobbyists, Canadians may ask how involved in the economy do they want their governments to be? You want pipelines &amp; are OK with overriding Constitutional jurisdictional &amp; indigenous rights? #cdnpoli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@derrickokeefe Bang on! 👏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmmMacfarlane That's your white male privilege talking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@musesandrants @EmmMacfarlane THIS!! ☝️👏👏👏👏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmmMacfarlane @PhilippeLagasse National media also not covering what could be biggest corruption scandal of them all: money laundering-opiods-real estate in BC, flourishing under BC Libs' (Christy Clark) watch. Instead, national cable news has her as a pundit on their panels, opining on issues such as SNC. 😖<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nothereforyour1 They've been that way at least since Haroer days. 24 hour news cycle feeds that attitude.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nothereforyour1 @BrendaBeaucham3 @JerryChomyn @BobRae48 @swaindiana It's the long game! I hope. Misery now, for real gains in the future. 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrendaBeaucham3 @JerryChomyn @BobRae48 @swaindiana They are winning already - forcing PM &amp; PMO to pivot &amp; changing the conversation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kind_of_Hoping @BestStephen @MPCelina @L82be @janephilpott No, they left out of principle; in Jody's case after being bullied, in Jane's case, after seeing the PMO &amp; other Liberals throw Jody under the bus. Trudeau has to walk the talk on compromise &amp; transparency. Timing is bad but fault is PMO's.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@David_Moscrop @christoaivalis I'd love a Liberal-NDP-Green government federally - I'm liking my BC NDP govt with Greens - they are making real change on many issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BestStephen @MPCelina @L82be @janephilpott Many women, up to now, try to play the men's game in business &amp; politics etc. These women didn't: instead, they are exemplifying feminine power: consensus, collaboration &amp; leading from the heart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jec79 @MPCelina Trudeau's PMO has been dreadful since day 1 &amp; just reached peak Peter's Principle. Brand is gone, baby, gone! You can't want gender equality &amp; not respect your female ministers &amp; even throw them under the bus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does Andrew Scheer read statements out loud with such difficulty? #cdnpoli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd be absolutely delighted to see a progressive, female PM &amp; a stellar female frontbench. Jane Philpott, Jody Wilson-Raybould, Chrystia Freeland &amp; Elizabeth May. Feminine power is all about consensus, collaboration, authenticity &amp; leading from the heart. 💪💪 #cdnpoli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@janephilpott You have done tremendous work for all Canadians. I respect your decision to not play the boy's club game. Feminine power is all about consensus, collaboration &amp; authenticity. You are a fabulous example of that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Justin_Ling Trudeau's PMO has always been dreadful &amp; just jumped the shark!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JerryChomyn @BobRae48 @swaindiana Feminine power - these are politicians refusing to play the boy's club game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really have admired Jane Philpott's work in all the ministries she has held in Cabinet; her resignation is disappointing for Canadians but totally respect her decision. Liberal women in revolt? #cdnpoli #SNCLavalinScandal<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CrippledU @CBCNews @CTVNews @globalnews @christyclarkbc Her comments won't age well once a public inquiry starts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@David_Moscrop This is just real politik. But it goes beyond party lines into public expectations, in this case, of how interventionist do we want our governments to be managing our economy. See pipelines.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@David_Moscrop House of Cards light. More like Borgen. Has potential for either an internal coup or fizzle out entirely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A lovely tribute to John Candy, one of Canada's favourite exports, besides maple syrup &amp; bacon. 😏 He made you laugh &amp; cry &amp; often groan, because there's a little bit of John Candy's many faces in each of us. #JohnCandy #comedy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know Canadian media are out of touch w #bcpoli when they ask Christy Clark to comment on politics.

<|startoftext|>@BraleyChuck @RobynRobynKnigh @TorontoStar Except Elizabeth May!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Andrew Scheer &amp; CPC, no policies on any issue, but extending their politics of fear &amp; racism, planting seeds of division. What do they expect to reap? #cdnpoli #yellowvestscanada<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvisonJ Duh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shocked by both Murray Rankin &amp; Nathan Cullen leaving federal politics. Both excellent, caring &amp; thoughtful politicians. Could they be eyeing running for BC NDP in next provincial election? Certainly could make a huge difference &amp; impact in #bcpoli. #cdnpoli #NDP #JagmeetSingh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AaronWherry How about the oil &amp; gas industry being under the same microscope as SNC Lavalin? My guess there's a whole pile of 💩 there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cdnpoli_memes Thanks for the follow!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunmclean I was speaking generally, not specifically to this case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Canadians are appalled that governments orchestrate op-eds to push their policies, they've been living in La-La Land. This has be done since the beginning of type. #cdnpoli #JodyWilsonRaybould #media<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TrevorsIdeas @DianeMariePosts @Debalap @TrilliumFlowers @davidakin @Puglaas At least in writing; am surprised she never fired  off a letter to tell Trudeau &amp; PMO to back off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slambert360 @kady Yup! The PMO is disgraceful. What a great speaker Jody is - curious whether she remains in caucus or a Liberal?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kady Yes. Strategically JWR loses power as soon as she speaks unless she has a bombshell against the PMO. Opposition might find themselves in  a tight corner after 'building' her up, depending on what she says. It's high drama! But hopefully we'll be out of some speculation misery!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Canada playing the long game against China. A Trojan horse (make that moose) will lead to the moral (&amp; dental) decay of China. Forget 5G, when we have the TimBit recipe secret! 🇨🇦 winning! #cdnpoli #TimHortons #Huawei #MengWanzhou  https://t.co/vyt4biaGFm<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cforcese @IvisonJ @ThomasHall17 Totally hooked on Borgen! Has informed my views on SNC, JWR, Butts &amp; the vomitorium of spin, social media &amp; 24 hour cable news! 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stphnmaher Andrew Scheer neither has the leadership or the intellectual finesse to say what's required to prevent the continued erosion of the C0C to the far right. Bernier nipping at his feet will continue its descent. Not electing Michael Chong as leader was CPC's greatest tactical error.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunmclean @IrwinCotler Absolutely! Yet government violence against its own people must be condemned. Sadly, this crisis in Venezuela looks like it will only get worse.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>LOL!!! Another bright light representing the US at the UN!! #cdnpoli #uspoli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>LOL @CBCNews going to Christy Clark for non-indigenous opinion on #Transmountain pipeline when likely the biggest corruption scandal in Canadian history took place under her watch. Money laundering, real estate, opiods. Also not covered by national media. #cdnpoli #bcpoli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surprise, surprise, the NEB, while acknowledging the risk to BC's environment &amp; marine life, nevertheless greenlights #TransMountain pipeline. Human folly on repeat. Rubber stamp, cross your fingers, bury your head in (tar) sand &amp; ignore science. #bcpoli #cdnpoli #ClimateChange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wjoates @kady My reaction too: people aren't allowed their own truth - everything is seen as partisan spin. We've gone down the hyper partisanship rabbit hole - it's horrible, superficial &amp; toxic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@18molly8 @zelmerj @MichelleRempel You are sticking to your opinion, not the facts. Enough. I consider this dialogue closed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@18molly8 @zelmerj @MichelleRempel You were the one introducing race by referencing white farmers, when black farmers &amp; workers are victims as well. Victims of crime &amp; poverty. Not persecution &amp; therefore not eligible to be considered refugees.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@18molly8 @zelmerj @MichelleRempel South African black farmers &amp; workers are equally targeted by crime syndicates, greed &amp; desperation &amp; urban blacks exponentionally more the targets of violent crime &amp; murder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@18molly8 @zelmerj @MichelleRempel "Endres’ claim was based on a risk of generalized crime in South Africa, meaning that it could impact almost anyone, not only those who are white or Afrikaners...the information the family relied on was “white-supremacist hate literature”  https://t.co/piAiFitumV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@irbrodie @nspector4 It's become even worse, is my point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@18molly8 @zelmerj @MichelleRempel Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@18molly8 @zelmerj @MichelleRempel Exactly - we have laws protecting the right of those fleeing violence &amp; persecution to seek asylum in Canada.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@18molly8 @zelmerj @MichelleRempel Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@18molly8 @zelmerj @MichelleRempel Yes. I have. I just gave links to the latest data.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nspector4 Surprised &amp; taken aback at the use of the word, yet it's true that social media is full of violent threats &amp; imagery against Trudeau to a degree I've never seen before in Canada. Very worrisome &amp; so depressing to see this irresponsible rhetoric ('hopefully' just that) in Canada.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@18molly8 @zelmerj @MichelleRempel Check your facts, not the spin from CPC. Enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@18molly8 @zelmerj @MichelleRempel And this:  https://t.co/bXP3RtXnoV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@18molly8 @zelmerj @MichelleRempel  https://t.co/OlIg7gT3Qk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@18molly8 @zelmerj @MichelleRempel Also, the numbers entering have declined recently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@18molly8 @zelmerj @MichelleRempel Clearly you need a backgrounder on the differences between asylum seekers, refugees &amp; immigrants:  https://t.co/EhSDtN5SiZ Of finalized asylum claims, majority of claimants are accepted  https://t.co/otEXNSHqEc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@18molly8 @zelmerj @MichelleRempel It all depends on the safety of the individual in their own country, whether their race, gender, religion, politics or sexual identity puts them at risk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@18molly8 @zelmerj @MichelleRempel Again, asylum seekers are not illegal; the situation in Haiti has deteriorated so migrants who may have been previously considered economic &amp; therefore inadmissible may have legitimate political reasons to stay in Canada. Each case has to be considered individually.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@18molly8 @zelmerj @MichelleRempel Asylum seekers are mostly from Latin America &amp; Africa &amp; violent states oppressing minorities &amp; activists. Those leaving their countries strictly for economic reasons will be turned away. But fragile economic states can break down fast into political chaos, i.e. Venezuela &amp; Haiti<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@zelmerj @MichelleRempel Faith Goldy, Rebel Media, white supremacists. Looks to me that more disbanding needs to happen asap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zelmerj @MichelleRempel Tell them to get rid of the Yellow Vest movement in their midst then! If they are co-opting their message, they won't have any issue with this &amp;, in fact, would make every effort to divorce themselves from such hate politics. Look at the footage, they are front &amp; centre! #cdnpoli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichelleRempel You mean pro-hate, pro-racism rally with Yellow Vest movement. Shame!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iancapstick @jenditchburn I totally understand that but I miss you though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pay attention, Canadian cable news. Chatelaine has its act together, why don't you? Why are you making the Yellow Vest movement into some sort of Heritage Moment? #cdnpoli #ConvoyForCanada @CBCNews @CTVNews @globalnews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewScheer So you're OK with the Yellow Vest movement accompanying them who are out &amp; out racists?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From Nigel Wright to Gerald #Butts - rise of PMO from seeds planted by Chretien deserves to wither away. Too much non-elected power centred on too-powerful PMs. Time to go back to Parliamentary roots: PM just leader of Cabinet, the ultimate decision body party in power. #cdnpoli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@David_Moscrop @jec79 Liberals themselves are keeping it alive &amp; well in the news cycle with their inept communications, overt &amp; covert, which has been true of every controversy/issue of this government.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MaxwellACameron @IanKing @keithbaldrey Why should 16 year olds be tested for civics knowledge?

Judging from my kids' experience, 16 is when kids are well informed, interested in current events &amp; not completely cynical.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SanityAA @SayBlade @trapdinawrpool Of course not, but there are a few connected with the yellow vest movement whose strings are being pulled by right-wing nationalist groups that thrive on the politics of fear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dave_Eby Many congratulations!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SayBlade @trapdinawrpool It's appalling how they're amplifying far-right messaging, even tho support is so low, while social justice &amp; indigenous movements with broad support get marginalized. But, in wake of Russian &amp; Iranian fake news bots, makes sense if MSM is measuring traction on social media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's breathless coverage of the oil &amp; gas convoy &amp; the anti-immigration yellow vesters, all dozen of them on a street corner on @CBCNews. Meanwhile today's Women's March in Vancouver honouring missing &amp; murdered Indigenous women gets zilch on MSM. #bcpoli #cdnpoli #MMIWG<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PnPCBC Why is there silence at the federal level of the RCMP's investigative bungling of BC's monstrously big money laundering-opiods-housing scandal? #bcpoli #cdnpoli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunmclean But that's the US situation, not our own. If McCallum had left well enough alone, the extradition request might have been tossed for reasons he outlined. If that happens now, China will perceive it as a victory for its tactics &amp; perception that Cdn govt can interfere with courts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunmclean Because he is saying one thing &amp; his government another, thus he's undermining Canada's rule of law position.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunmclean Yes, China won't be happy with McCallum's removal. That's why they can sit on the new ambassador's credentials to stick it to us if they wanted to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When Trudeau chooses a new ambassador, China has the gambit of sitting on his/her diplomatic credentials, leaving Canadians in China without the highest Canadian representation they need &amp; deserve at a time when Chinese-Canadian relations are at their worst. #cdnpoli #MengWanzhou<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>McCallum has had a history of speaking his mind &amp; rocking the boat. That's fine as a politician. Not as a diplomat, especially when it makes an already complex situation even more complicated. Imprisoned Canadians will pay the price for this gaffe. #cdnpoli #China #JohnMcCallum<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whether or not John McCallum was making his own opinions or PMO views known, the point is a diplomat can't say anything political in public &amp;/or to media that makes him/her the focus. Diplomacy is best served by professional diplomats, not career politicians. Two separate worlds.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RickAnderson @FairQuestions Yes, that seems to be the slant of media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RickAnderson @FairQuestions I really don't see the problem about NGO's caring about the planet, as opposed to corporate interests, already subsidized by government even if foreign owned, being advanced through media ad buys &amp; government lobbying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RickAnderson @FairQuestions My point about Fraser Institute et al is about foreign monies propping these organizations up to advance a particular agenda in Canadian politics, amongst other interests, advocating for the resource sector &amp; dismissing environmental &amp; Indigenous issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RickAnderson @FairQuestions Canada*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RickAnderson @FairQuestions Environmentalists around the world care about the environment of the world. Donating to causes outside our borders doesn't mean we're subverting politics there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RickAnderson @FairQuestions What about the Fraser Institue? The Manning Centre &amp; CTF? Lots of foreign funding of these groups, not to mention the oil &amp; gas donations over the years to politicians of all stripes. And yes, many oil companies in Canads have foreign (China &amp; US) majority ownership.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BruceAHeyman @abbydphillip If so, there is no rule of law in the US.

<|startoftext|>@garymasonglobe Canadian MSM rarely talks climate change. Very little mention of it during the whole #KinderMorgan 'debate', apart from Trudeau's standard the two go hand-in-hand policy. Debate positioned as BC recalcitrance vs fed national project &amp; AB's right to oil - its provincial identity.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AndrewScheer Did you not read the Supreme Court decision?? It ruled, quite simply, that #TransMountainPipeline is the opposite of 'the cleanest, most ethical, environmentally-friendly" pipeline in the world &amp; tramples over indigenous rights. Do you not respect the Federal Court?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carole_bouchard From the clip I saw it was unclear what Mo was saying. He could have just been concerned for Nick's physical welfare &amp; whether he was trying - maybe a warning. Doubt he would or could coach.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@journo_dale So clearly @MichelleRempel hasn't even bothered to read the Supreme Court decision &amp; couldn't care less about indigenous rights being disregarded, environmental concerns completely out of the #KM equation nor a completely flawed NEB process. Just oil. What a surprise. Not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Whyplash54 Except the Supreme Court of Canada agrees with me &amp; I with it. So evidence on my side, bombast on yours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wish more of our political leaders had this ethos of doing what's right for now &amp; future generations in a spirit of respect, inquiry, compassion &amp; love for our planet &amp; all life forms on it.

<|startoftext|>@steveshmidt @Whyplash54 @liberal_party Unbelievable. But speaks to not only the power &amp; influence on government of the resource industry, but the feverish political belief that oil  is our only way to pay the big bills. Canada is stuck in the "hewers of wood" mentality. We need to level up our economy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Whyplash54 Didn't say #KM was over. But it should never have been approved with such slap-dash, cut &amp; pasted science, flimsy business scenarios &amp; most importantly, ignoring &amp; running roughshod over indigenous rights. #cdnpoli #bcpoli #KinderMorgan #TransMountain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@David_Moscrop Genuine, transparent &amp; impartial process matters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let me rewrite this @cbcnews: In a stunning victory for the environment &amp; indigenous rights the Supreme Court saw past the past, the heavy-handed politics &amp; the enormous oil sector pressure &amp; saw #KM for what it was: deeply flawed &amp; wrong. #bcpoli #cdnpoli #KinderMorgan<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Surrey! Flex your urban muscles: the Cdn gun lobby may have way more influence than ever before, especially within CPC, but you have the population to make tough gun control happen.

<|startoftext|>Once upon a time we had semi-decent gun control. Much has changed since the most unfortunate demise of the gun registry.  https://t.co/I2xwVaPuc5 #cdnpoli #Toronto #Danforth #Surrey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@purva_creations @sophiefotini @MeanwhileinCana Yikes! Lucky thing your plans changed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sophiefotini @purva_creations @MeanwhileinCana So hard to process. My friends have noticed an uptick recently of incidents in Danforth &amp; worry about their community,  present &amp; future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jedi72 @MeanwhileinCana Fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jedi72 @MeanwhileinCana I'm hardly say8 saying all, just some &amp; that's all it takes. Just facts from articles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sophiefotini @purva_creations @MeanwhileinCana You must be so shaken up - I know my friends are &amp; worried about those they might know among the casualties. What a sad day for such a vibrant &amp; fun neighborhood.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sophiefotini @purva_creations @MeanwhileinCana Still so early in the discovery process, but that is shocking if true. Handguns should be banned. Nobody needs them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jedi72 @MeanwhileinCana Then these owners just say the gun was stolen &amp; oops, I forgot to report it, can I do it now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jedi72 @MeanwhileinCana Legal gun owners who don't care about legal niceties sell their guns to whomever, no questions asked. If that gun is used in a crime, they say it had been stolen. There is very poor tracking of guns in in Canada post the registry, evidently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jedi72 @MeanwhileinCana Again, we're talking about straw guns: legal guns sold to whomever, no questions asked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jedi72 @MeanwhileinCana Most illegal guns in B.C. from within Canada: report  https://t.co/x6PaLzBuOm via @timescolonist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@purva_creations @MeanwhileinCana I'm not at all interested in party politics, but am in action. Very sadly the gun lobby has much more influence after the gun registry was scrapped.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@purva_creations @MeanwhileinCana I'm just stating facts, no ideology here. The question was how are guns being obtained? I have dear friends who live in Danforth &amp; frequent the restaurants &amp; grocery store shot up last night. I do care deeply &amp; like others, want to get guns off the streets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jedi72 @MeanwhileinCana What I learnt today is BC had a commission to study gun ownership issues last year &amp; this is what they discovered. They asked the feds to close the loophole &amp; they haven't yet. You're assuming gun owners do due diligence; many don't &amp; gun shops don't need to keep records.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trump_googles Thanks for the follow!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeanwhileinCana It's actually easier than you'd think. There is no legal record keeping required by gun stores so a legit owner can resell his gun to whomever he chooses. The Liberals were supposed to close this loophole but while the legislation was introduced in April,  nothing has happened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CrispinGloverON Thanks for the follow!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Instead of stoking false fear about asylum-seekers crossing the border,  politicians should exert more pressure on US to stem illegal guns crossing the border, something that will actually help keep Canadian residents safe. #Danforthshooting #Toronto #Surrey #TorontoStrong<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lraitt @Stephen It simply isn't right that Stephen Harper failed to notify the government of his meeting with Trump nor his position. It's imperative that former PMs act in concert with the current government as Chrétien did. We need a united front on trade. #cdnpoli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alex_Panetta Congrats on the new gig but what we really need is for US to understand Canada.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stephen Harper has always schlepped his own brand. Extraordinary that he failed to advise PMO on his Trump visit. Without knowing his purpose, he very well may undermine Canada's trade position. We need a united  front, not a former PM possibly going rogue. #cdnpoli  https://t.co/k4XTw1lgNa<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Take off, eh! The BC economy depends on a clean environment, protection of its endangered wild &amp; marine life &amp; public health. @JustinTrudeau  campaigned on pipeline social licence.

<|startoftext|>This is the Liberal government's world-class response to oil spills in BC's waterways.

<|startoftext|>@SeamusORegan @JoanneCangal @NLtweets @NickWhalenMP @avalonMPKen @Scott_Simms @Gudie @YvonneJJones @BardishKW Thanks for jeopardizing BC's tourism &amp; film industry with your KinderMorgan decision.

<|startoftext|>@MerlinYYC @mcgillu Congrats!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustinTrudeau @Bill_Morneau @jimcarr_wpg 50 jobs in BC, environmental &amp; public hazards, threats to BC economy of tourism, film &amp; fisheries; trampling over indigenous rights. KinderMorgan knew it didn't have a business case for this pipeline &amp; now you've mortgaged our economic &amp; climate change future on a sunset industry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In real politik terms, buying #KinderMorgan pipeline in hopes of getting it built won't get Trudeau more seats in Alberta, jeopardizes 18 Liberal seats in BC &amp; potentially  some in Quebec. Liberal Party brain trust is missing some IQ points. #cdnpoli #bcpoli  https://t.co/Ldgd2DUsdM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kudos to #TransMountain for their clever con job on Canadians, unloading the economic mess of #KinderMorgan pipeline on Canadian taxpayers to protect their bottom line &amp; shareholders. BC always saw through you, but well-played! #bcpoli #cdnpoli  https://t.co/y56fA0AM6o<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Goodbye Liberal seats in the Lower Mainland.Trudeau nationalizes a pipeline in a sunset industry with oil prices projected to sink while climate change rages on. Gambling on BC. Canada unprepared for the challenges ahead &amp; missing the economic opportunity of green energy. #fail  https://t.co/vAjTfEfI2E<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bad enough there's no social licence for #KM pipeline in BC, that it endangers BC's economy, environment, public health &amp; stomps on indigenous rights, but for taxpayers to foot the bill for a project #KinderMorgan knows has little business sense in a sunset industry is outrageous  https://t.co/eCqR3vAbEV<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SquirlyGirll I wish more Canadians understood what we are up against and how urgent climate change is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SquirlyGirll I agree!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SquirlyGirll Agree; this is the shift we need to take.  Some provinces &amp; municipalities are making these investments but there should be a more robust national strategy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SquirlyGirll It's a matter of public policy which requires a concerted effort on multiple fronts  We have to make the shift to renewables quickly; we're already slipping behind other countries in investment &amp; R&amp;D. It can't be done just by consumers; it's almost too late as it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2cansan OMG, corporate welfare  just awful!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TIFFable And how federal policing powers will be brought to #KinderMorgan to reign in the very taxpayers who fund the RCMP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AGAIN, surprise, surprise, #pnpcbc panel doesn't once talk Canada's Paris commitments when discussing #KinderMorgan but instead the foreign corporate interests at play. Neither the importance of renewables. National interest vs global interest. What world do we want? #cdnpoli<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Calls for Justin Trudeau to cancel important trips abroad - which deal with trade &amp; security, fairly important issues, you'd think - are wrong &amp; underscore this ludicrous notion that the whole country will fall apart over a Texas-owned pipeline. 👇  https://t.co/nnPBQmGxGE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rmfaris @RachelNotley Also, let's be clear that #TransMountain would love nothing more than a government injection of funds to make its weak economic case for #KinderMorgan somewhat more viable without taking any business risks itself.

<|startoftext|>@voicilefer @Pontifex It shouldn't be for sure, but the Vatican is a messy labyrinth where paths &amp; motives are unclear. I'm guessing that outrage in the Spanish Church isn't outrageous enough &amp; doesn't warrant apologies. This Pope is veneer; nothing substantial has changed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@voicilefer @Pontifex Generally the thinking is that the Catholic Church is afraid of mass (excuse the pun) lawsuits. The Catholic Church had no problem apologizing to the Irish covering up sexual abuse by priests recently, but who knows what the thinking is here? Not a significant Catholic base here?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Easter symbolizes new hope &amp; renewal. But for @Pontifex that doesn't include his relationship with indigenous peoples in Canada. Absolutely shameful that he refuses to apologize for the #CatholicChurch's key role in cultural genocide. The only church to stay silent. #cdnpoli<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JasonPigeon2 @CDN_CommonSense I'm not a partisan of any party. I dislike &amp; react badly to anyone who uses disinformation techniques, negative language &amp; insults, period.

<|startoftext|>@CDN_CommonSense @wjoates @AndrewScheer The fact is Atwal has been making the rounds of both Liberals &amp; CPC - he is an attention seeker. India is clearly OK with Atwal.

<|startoftext|>@CDN_CommonSense @AndrewScheer I agree that the Liberals screwed this up. If Jean believes there are other forces at play, that should be kept to Privy Council. Speaking to media was a mistake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CDN_CommonSense @AndrewScheer Security briefings always take place in Privy Council<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CDN_CommonSense @AndrewScheer All Privy Council activities are classified.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bruceanderson Climate change is already here &amp; Canada's action plan, not much better than Harper's, is a tepid response to the dire circumstances facing us &amp; even that isn't being met. It's ludicrous to justify pipelines as part of a climate plan.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Norm_Farrell @CTVVancouver @ctv_jon There's a lot of loose reporting in Canada regarding oil. Journalists always focus on Alberta's economy &amp; never on BC's. When has there ever been in-depth MSM expose on the industries that lose big time should there be an oil spill here &amp; consequences to public health?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shocked at @CTVVancouver reporting' - i.e. editorializing &amp; falsely - last night that supply issue triggering high gas prices in YVR would be solved with KinderMorgan pipeline. No! Another example of both lazy journalism &amp; oil's deep state. #bcpoli #cdnpoli  https://t.co/u4xUmJHqQe<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@accfanto @Alex_Panetta Which makes US position all the more puzzling. If he thinks Canada is nervous &amp; will capitulate, that won't happen now. Trade war winds blowing hard now, but with EU &amp; other allies. US just wants to isolate itself from the world, even if it means inflation.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Garossino It just shows you how little we know of Indian politics, domestically &amp; conducted abroad within expat communities. China too! We shouldn't weigh in with opinion until we understand the full picture. We are naïve!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Westview_Al @univrsle As a difference-maker, I imagine because the budget has gender parity as a focus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@susan123go @althiaraj @althiaraj is really the only one raising vital questions on a complex issue.

<|startoftext|>@rodmickleburgh @JimsonHogarth Zero impact? And partisan ads made to look like front covers during elections also have no impact? Clearly editorials &amp; op-ed pieces have impact; otherwise they wouldn't exist! Just ask New York Times!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rodmickleburgh @JimsonHogarth @scoopercooper @KathyTGlobe No, thanks to Twitter I'm familiar with their great work. Just saying that it could have been done at least 8 years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rodmickleburgh @JimsonHogarth No, it's the coversge too, the slant their articles take &amp; laxy reporting. Years of BC corruption unreported- why? Did you not just say there was nothing postive about the NDP budget today?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rodmickleburgh @JimsonHogarth Disagree. I'd read newspapers if they were quality ones &amp; not partisan. Having the Sun &amp; G&amp;M papers exhort us to vote for Harper lost me.

<|startoftext|>@Adam_Stirling So protecting our tourism, TV &amp; film, fisheries &amp; agriculture industries is just to be cranky?

<|startoftext|>I find it extraordinary that the national discourse about #KinderMorgan is always played out from the perspective of the Alberta economy, portrays BC as lotus-loving elites &amp; totally ignores the risks oil spills present to our economy: tourism, TV &amp; film &amp; fisheries. #bcpoli  https://t.co/SLeXRH7wHR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@supriyadwivedi Shocking security miss.

<|startoftext|>@KirkMStephens @iancapstick BC is a coastal province with a coastal economy. Which means a clean environment is required if you are to have salmon &amp; seafood on your table. And mine. BC jobs &amp; public health are on the line.  #bcpoli #cdnpoli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Um, @iancapstick you're saying that a bitumen leak is a given, why should BC take all the risk when its economy depends on a clean environment? Why is it all about what Alberta's economy needs, not BC's? Saying no to #KinderMorgan is popular in BC, BTW. #cdnpoli #bcpoli #pnpcbc<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MuskokaMoneybag @kinsellawarren @ipoliticsca This type of click-bait, yellow journalism denigrates women, belittles the #metoo movement &amp; the abuse suffered by victims. Shameful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarbyCar @RachelNotley Absolutely agree. 👏<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pqpolitics @mdobrinskaya @OpenMediaOrg Let's be clear: this is a huge marketing campaign for Bell - #BellLetsTalk is trending, not only in Canada, but in the US too. I agree that government should do more &amp; integrate mental health within a generalized health strategy. #MentalHealthAwareness #EndTheStigma #cdnpoli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Rachel Notley starts a trade war with BC, does that mean we can sideline SiteC? 😆#cdnpoli #bcpoli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mdobrinskaya @pqpolitics Not to mention Bell Canada pressuring its employees to strong-arm sell unwanted services to customers - thus causing anxiety to both employees &amp; clients - as well as its efforts to control the Internet. #BellLetsTalk @OpenMediaOrg #EndTheStigma #MentalHealthMatters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is precisely what BC is worried about @RachelNotley - who will hold an emergency meeting for climate &amp; stewardship of our vital, yet precarious environment? Why should BC risk public health, its fisheries, tourism &amp; film industries for bitumen few want? #cdnpoli  https://t.co/orwTV0rZwF<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@carole_bouchard They definitely shouldn't: it's downright unhealthy &amp; irresponsible  to let them continue playing in such extreme heat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acIIive @AustralianOpen It's miserable to watch I can't imagine how it feels. I see the stands aren't full so the heat must be affecting spectators as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carole_bouchard Comment jouer dans l'enfer? Ce n'est pas juste.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bgtennisnation They shouldn't be playing in this heat - it's just not healrhy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Kudos to the government for creating an ombudsperson to oversee the behaviour abroad of Canadian companies.

<|startoftext|>@michaelcoren The school &amp; school board have to assume responsibility in this too: they should never have exposed this child to media, certainly not before ascertaining the facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UniquelyGillian @Mikeggibbs Indeed! Hopefully there will be compassion &amp; understanding for the girl &amp; her family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UniquelyGillian @Mikeggibbs That's the role of the principal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UniquelyGillian @Mikeggibbs Oooohhh , that is bad. Here in Vancouver there are stringent protocols for exposing kids to even a pic, let alone media frenzy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UniquelyGillian @Mikeggibbs From my experience, the protocol is for the school to contact the board 1) about incident; 2) of media interest. Board initiates own protocol &amp; handles media. Family would have to agree to media exposure too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UniquelyGillian @Mikeggibbs Without knowing its content, I find it strange &amp; questionable that the school &amp; TDSB went public so quickly, exposing the girl &amp; family to so much media. Poor kid - the schoolyard &amp; community may be very tough for her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UniquelyGillian @Mikeggibbs I'll try to check it out.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BenWest @AKimCampbell In US, there are no requirements for SC justices. Remember too that at some levels judges are elected, either identifying as GOP, Dems or independents. But vetting happens along partisan lines, at Judicial Committee &amp; Senate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenWest @AKimCampbell Applications are open to everyone, not govt selected, so you could nominate yourself if you fulfilled requirements. If you're looking at political stripes, Richard Wagner comes from PC heritage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenWest PMs balance regional/civil/common law needs. Under Harper, there was a MP committee reviewing potential candidates. Trudeau brought in functional bilingualism requirement &amp; advisory board (4 from legal community, 3 govt appointed, @AKimCampbell the chair) to review applications<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenWest That is our system: makes it less partisan this way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zelataran But we should still care: one Earth, one people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zelataran Oh, we definitely shouldn't be smug - there's much to do &amp; improve.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zelataran Yes, there might be some of that sentiment in play. But more so, that Puerto Ricans are Hispanic, brown &amp; not 'real Americans'.  :-(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zelataran Canada can send foreign aid to Puerto Rico! :-o  Actually I think the Canadian navy dropped off supplies on the DL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zelataran Equal concern, not greater.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's absolutely beyond belief that #uspoli basically shrugs its shoulders about Russian interference in their democracy &amp; essentially ignores the over 1000 Americans deaths in Puerto Rico, its infrastructure still crippled. #MondayMusings #2017isbizarre<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ride_stuff @bcndp Apparently, the cabinet ministers representing the Peace did campaign on getting rid of SiteC, so potential recalls there could be very interesting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AaronWherry Weaver is holding out for electoral reform; if he has that in his back pocket, the game's on. However, in the interim the Greens will lose anti-SiteC momentum; already there's a twitter membership drive. What might be interesting is the potential for recalls in affected ridings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ride_stuff @bcndp Mind you, #BCNDP never promised to stop #SiteC; just said they would review it. But that showed it was a boondoggle of epic proportions, draining #BCHydro, precious agricultural land, indigenous rights &amp; benefiting few. NDP always trying to balance environment w labour base.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry @jjhorgan @Dave_Eby you lost me at #SiteC  It may not be easy being Green, but it's how I'm going to vote now.

<|startoftext|>Thank you, George Heyman, BC's Environmental minister, for articulating so well, firmly, yet reasonably why BC is so against the #KinderMorgan pipeline. #pnpcbc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why should BC be conciliatory about #KinderMorgan pipeline? No pundit talks about the cost to BC's economy should there be an oil spill on land or in the Salish Sea, let alone the threat to public health &amp; fragile ecosystems. #pnpcbc #cdnpoli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Completely flummoxed how #pnpcbc panel thinks Rachel Notley speaking to Vancouver Board of Trade is going to change the minds of #bcpoli - it's speaking to the choir! #cdnpoli<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mtnbvan @NEWS1130 Me too! ;-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@armstrongcbc @OnTheMoneyCBC Absolutely not! How can consumers make the shift without producers?

<|startoftext|>@armstrongcbc @OnTheMoneyCBC It's a deadend road already. Climate change is here.

<|startoftext|>I don't think the Vancouver Board of Trade is ground zero for BC's #KinderMorgan opposition. Rachel Notely is preaching to the choir. If she's serious about changing minds, she should do town halls in Vancouver &amp; Burnaby.  #bcpoli #pnpcbc #cdnpoli #TransMountain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HockeyRockBeer @RachelNotley @NEWS1130 Here, here - well said!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RachelNotley It's b/c #bcpoli knows the facts that we're against #KinderMorgan I resent that you/Alberta play the national unity card. BC is equally concerned with the tarsands' impact on Alberta's ecology, public health &amp; indigenous rights. Why not invest in the future, in green energy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please @Dave_Eby say no to #SiteC - save agricultural land, stop a boondoggle of epic proportions &amp; let BC go green energy all the way! #bcpoli #vancouverpointgrey  https://t.co/bOfEecuEMo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@armstrongcbc @OnTheMoneyCBC Is there a need to get bitumen to market given the costs &amp; risks?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@armstrongcbc @OnTheMoneyCBC You talked about tar sands discounted price, but not why: with so much supply, the case for bitumen is waning. Why not talk about refining, if you have to go that route? Why not talk about success of Cdn green energy sector in the future?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's infuriating for #bcpoli to see #kindermorgan coverage @OnTheMoneyCBC not even attempt to explore the business case for pipeline expansion (hello: discounted bitumen price) nor business case for BC opposition.

<|startoftext|>@lummer66 But then there's the issue of indigenous rights on land along the pipeline route; hence the legal challenges. On paper it might be a federal matter, but it means little when there's no social license on the ground.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AndrewMitrovica LOL!!  https://t.co/61fOtytupL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fascinating &amp; terribly disconcerting &amp; depressing that no one talks indigenous rights when discussing KinderMorgan. It's an essential piece to understanding BC's resistance to pipeline expansion; it's not just climate change &amp; environmental concern. #pnpcbc #cdnpoli #bcpoli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting that Kathleen Monk has sided with Rachel Notley over KinderMorgan &amp; not with John Horgan in the provincial NDP battle. Guess her environmental &amp; indigenous rights principles only go so far. #NDP #pnpcbc #cdnpoli #bcpoli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haha, KinderMorgan isn't in "BC's jurisdiction"?? BC takes all the environmental risk &amp; has no economic benefit deriving from this pipeline. It runs through our province: I think we have a say in this decision. #pnpcbc #bcpoli #cdnpoli #indigenousrights<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't understand why the federal government can't at least sue IBM for Phoenix's failures. Why doesn't the supplier step up with fixes and/or compensation? This has happened to Australia as well after all. #pnpcbc #cdnpoli<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TIFFable @PnPCBC never seriously questions the tarsands impact on climate change. It's evidently a "don't go there" directive.

<|startoftext|>@Bill_McCreery @pqpolitics @zackjmosley @swanson4council @JudyGravesYVR She would have been one voice on council; voters would understand this. Important to change conversation though &amp; push for fresh ideas.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pqpolitics @Bill_McCreery @zackjmosley @swanson4council @JudyGravesYVR I found Greens bland &amp; neither here nor there. Strange since they've made such inroads provincially, you'd think they'd seize momentum<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pqpolitics @Bill_McCreery @zackjmosley @swanson4council @JudyGravesYVR Big point in that voters are confident that Swanson wouldn't betray them &amp; sellout. That kind of trust is priceless in politics.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@zackjmosley @Bill_McCreery @pqpolitics @swanson4council @JudyGravesYVR Not big difference between Swanson &amp; Graves; certainly in terms of voter perception. But an end to 1st past the post would be great.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pqpolitics @Bill_McCreery @zackjmosley @swanson4council @JudyGravesYVR Great result for Swanson given indie status; bodes well for 2018. Strange Greens so slow out of the gate with Fry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bill_McCreery @zackjmosley @pqpolitics @swanson4council @JudyGravesYVR Agree: vote splitting was a foregone conclusion. There was enough difference w Fry but should have been either Swanson or Graves. #vanelxn<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Tenaciousceeee @AndrewScheer @CPC_HQ Yes, if CPC were a thinking political party, they'd be concerned how they dominate the shallow end in talent, IQ, diversity, gender &amp; age.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Campsal12  Sigh. Yes, good analysis, still too easy on Bergevin for not adding scoring. Poor Price: it'll be hard to get on good team prob<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizD12 @RV_ETSports @asifintoronto Agree, Julien didn't have time to make his mark. Ludicrous for Habs fans to suggest blowing team up. They just need scoring depth mostly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@asifintoronto Yeah, me too. I guess I'll passively cheer on any Canadian team left, but probably will spend more time cheering Raptors at this point. :-(<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@asifintoronto Thanks for the follow! Who are you going to follow now in playoffs or are you done? 😥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LizD12 @RV_ETSports @asifintoronto Top 6 has never been his thing. For sure, Bergevin stuck w his BFF Therrien way too long; sp tough for Julien to step in so late in season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Campsal12 Well, Habs still have some really good pieces. Not a total rebuild required, like Canucks. Bergevin has never addressed scoring depth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Campsal12 Doubt he'd want to be with a rebuilding Canucks. Calgary maybe??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Campsal12 Bergevin's been a disaster: he seemed to start so well, but has traded a lot of talent away, for????? And stuck with Therrien for 2 long. 😥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rodmickleburgh Yes, he always seemed like a gent &amp; miss his sarcasm with media! Always had a mischievous twinkle in his eye.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alex_Panetta Me too. Post Subban trade, I stopped following @CanadiensMTL online &amp; on TV but felt I had to support during playoffs. Feel sorry for Price.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rodmickleburgh So bizarre &amp; uncomfortable to see these two coaches behind the benches, as a Habs fan 1st &amp; Canucks fan 2nd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmmMacfarlane @asifintoronto @GMolsonCHC My thoughts exactly. There isn't *that* player with infectious belief, energy &amp; heart. Thanks a bunch @GMolsonCHC!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@asifintoronto @RV_ETSports @LizD12 And responsible too for getting Subban out - judging from rumours? Habs still have same problem of years ago: can't score when it counts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Byebye Marc Bergevin: what a waste of a season, trades fizzled, dressing room politics sapped &amp; still relying on Price to bail Habs out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RV_ETSports @LizD12 @asifintoronto Bergevin impressed at first, but has totally bombed. Sticking w Therrien way past expiry date, trading away talent &amp; mishandling youth AWFUL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RV_ETSports Agree, Habs just don't have same energy level, nor belief. Don't want to be tiresome about Subban, but his belief &amp; effort was infectious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Raspititious Pft, now worse than anyone on Rangers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RV_ETSports Habs are resigned to their fate. They haven't played 60 min this series &amp; not having their scorers score w/o any scoring depth is a killer.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>CPC didn't win elxn as got "distracted from little things" says Trost, like Senate corruption &amp; peddling racist policies. #mcc2017 #CPCLdr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CPC still believe that humans &amp; dinosaurs coexisted. Witness their dinosaur economic &amp; non-existent social policies. #CPCLdr #mcc2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeMcPickles Might be too intellectually honest to be in CPC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CPC is so conservative they want to pour big money into big oil when every other country is moving on in green energy. #CPCLdr #mcc2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeMcPickles Michael Chong is the only rational one up there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeMcPickles Gawd, he's horrible. All that foreign money subsidizing anti-pipeline demonstration &amp; indigenous activism  #cdnpoli #CPCLdr 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Andrew Scheer wants to screen Venezuelan oil (they still have some?) for Canadian values. FN can just suck it up #mcc2017 #CPCLdr #cdnpoli<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rawjpoutine @acoyne  The acceptability is CPC seizing Trump effect-normalization of racism-to whip up base. Cynical, dangerous &amp; lamentable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rawjpoutine @acoyne  Um,   niqab ban, barbaric practices tip line were overt enough. CPC has been mining fear of the other for years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rawjpoutine @acoyne  Where have you been? CPC has been doing this for last ten years!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acoyne @Patricia_Ann_E  What? There was repair work on CPC - in what other dimension?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBCAlerts @wisemonkeysblog  So much for the CPC defending working Canadians. Their true colours revealed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coreyshefman Absolutely agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmmMacfarlane @1loriking Agree, but question your tense. CPC has been in Rebel bullshit for the last 10 years. So ahead of Trumpian sewer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The white rump! LOL @iancapstick It's way too big for my liking - needs to go on a radical diet. #pnpcbc #cdnpoli #motion103<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nevineb Fingers crossed! 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nevineb That's for sure!! Julien also has something to prove to the Habs...again!! Those Bruins-Habs games will be awesome at least!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nevineb Oh that's interesting; I hadn't heard that! I believe that Price is SO done with Therrien; hence his rocky play lately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nevineb This came several years too late; barely follow Habs now. Price seems to be playing to rule, so hope this is positive. Thoughts?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bloody about time Bergevin gave up on his bf. I'm relieved Michel Therrien has been relieved of his duties. But Julien? Not convinced. #habs<|endoftext|>
