<|startoftext|>I’m directing my shiny metal ass to bite itself @TheBillyWest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LouisOneDay Only with myself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justadick Tell me about your fellow Kentuckians<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justadick Wow how did he get re-elected?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We either have to accept that we live among a bunch of fucking simpletons or we need to investigate KY and SC for voter fraud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please I am so sick of this filthy cunt showing up on my feed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@THEONLYRNKATE Fuck being lady like! Those were words I lived by pre-Covid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pixienic My tongue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Scaramucci Why are you pretending to be on our side? What’s in it for you honestly?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m constantly saying what the fuck and honestly I’m fucking sick of asking that question<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaellevine2 @Empath_g_app BREAKING: I’m a fucking asshole and I’m done with everything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BerkmanGhost They don’t even deserve shit. If there was a level below shot they’re not even worthy of that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck the entire Republican Party<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cpdagosta They’re private photos. I feel no need to enhance anything but I have better problem with enhanced photos<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cpdagosta Yeah I have a lot in my hidden file<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Skyler4149 Ask her if she has any recommended colleagues in Massachusetts please<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cpdagosta Nah I’m a novice. I just take a bunch of pictures<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cpdagosta Oh all my photos are mine I have almost 40,000<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cpdagosta Your photography is intense it reminds me of my passion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cpdagosta Thank you for posting beautiful pics because it reminds me why I originally came to Twitter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cpdagosta Looks like my bed after a night of passion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotOneNotTwo I can think of a better logo that wouldn’t be so romantic fuck the gop<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#RecountKentucky #VoterFraud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandiMax2 I am the opposite I have no appetite at all. Fuck him! I always wanted to lose weight but not this way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dawnalana2 Thank you for asking 💙 If I only knew you and I could take over the world<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m not a weak fucking person but this really wearing on me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandiMax2 Damn. He basically gave me an eating disorder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cpdagosta I live in Massachusetts I’m just visiting LI right now. I get enough snow on mass. The first year I moved to the island it never snowed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bluvelvet1122 Tools! They’re all a big bag of tools. If I say what I really think I will get suspended again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cpdagosta Flurries the other day but nothing stuck and it was in the 50s today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cpdagosta No other reasons I shall not disclose but I’ll just say I’m here for fun<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cpdagosta I’m visiting an old friend on Long Island right now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Skyler4149 Best of luck like I said before it’s difficult to find a god psychiatrist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shanearama I’d rather be a fly on the massage parlor wall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cpdagosta 25 in middle island was the pyro place. The pic you posted was the place i used to live at in coram<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cpdagosta Awesome pic brings back memories For purposes of not being date-mined I will tell you I may or may not have lived there in the 2000s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cpdagosta Last I knew it was torn down and “Fairfield” bought it. They built a new complex and they are probably charging ridiculously unaffordable rents as well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cpdagosta Sorry I shouldn’t rag on my old hood but if you can’t laugh what can you do?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cpdagosta 🤣 gone downhill? From what standards? 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nathaliejacoby1 Futurama, futurama and futurama (all seasons and specials currently available on hulu)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cpdagosta It was on 25 in middle island between the Walmart and the abandoned Kmart<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who wants a cookie? 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cpdagosta I lived in the complex across from compare foods plaza on 25 and the management of that place basically abandoned it in the process of selling. Twice when I lived there people lit their apartments on fire to the point of buildings being condemned True fucking story<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandiMax2 I love how your bio says trump makes me barf! I’d give agreement details but I don’t want to offend anyone. I try to be nice but I can be a real asshole<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rushmc We don’t even have a society anymore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@holliberry842 What I’ve been dealing with I think I’d rather be dealing with my anxiety right now. I apologize I don’t mean to compare our plights but fuck these mental disorders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeaceTogether7 @Empath_g_app OMG I just saw all of the typos in my response<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BonHanson79 What if it’s a metalhead’s (well you know) while you’re somewhere cold ?hmmm 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cpdagosta I don’t even remember my roommate used to do the ordering 🤣 I willl say though Ginos in Ronkonkoma had the best pizza from what I remember<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cpdagosta But coram has its rough spots - Gordon heights but I haven’t lived their in years so who knows. All places have their bad spots. Middle island was the last place I lived and it wasn’t a good area where I was at<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cpdagosta Indeed<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PeaceTogether7 @Empath_g_app Depression is horrible. I hope feel better soon too. Too me the worst part is I know better and there’s nothing I can do about it. So frustrating<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cpdagosta I lived in Florida too at one point. Orlando in the late 90s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cpdagosta Coram from 2001-2009 various other parts of Suffolk county 2009-2015<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cpdagosta I wonder if we’ve ever met in real life although I think I may be older than you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cpdagosta Holy shit! I lived in coram my first eight years there! Pinewood village on 112<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cpdagosta Yo do you still live on Long Island? I lived there for 14 years<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dale_E_Hayes I have too many stories to tell hmm but wait does this involve sex with just myself or another person/people 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@misspiperwood Never walked out but fell asleep during the movie Species<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DMBfangrl76 I think it’s more than some 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DMBfangrl76 I’ve noticed a few incidents of infighting. It’s bullshit we’re supposed to be on the same side but people are going to be people and a lot of people are fucking assholes honestly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All of this drinking is making me thirsty 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuneEscalante @wendywooldridge I have tattoos needles do not scare me. It’s funny because I was getting a shot once and the nurse who obviously must have seen my tattooed arm asked if I was afraid of needles 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotOneNotTwo Like I said I’m no mathematician. I can’t articulate certain thing. It’s the old adage those who can, do and those who can’t, teach<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotOneNotTwo 543= 5+4+3= 12 = 3 543 /3= 181<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotOneNotTwo Better than mine. I was going to say the sum of any number that can be broken down to 3 is divisible by 3. I’m probably not even using official math terms<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Custodela An old timey mustache applied upside down and on the wrong facial area. I’m not as clever as you @Custodela<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nfloyd52 🤣 perfect is boring though. Give me someone that can make me laugh and hold a decent conversation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotOneNotTwo I’m going to sound like a weirdo but math is fun to me. I like figuring out things I would say more but it’s either common knowledge or I’ll seem like a deranged wannabe mathematician 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoTrump4me I took a walk earlier to calm myself and I may have to take another one soon to go get more beer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotOneNotTwo That’s an understatement 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#OccupyMitch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotOneNotTwo I should’ve actually thought about it more than assuming I knew the answer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotOneNotTwo Thank you. I learned something today now and honestly that’s what I live for. I love math and to me it’s the most important skill you can have but I’m so rusty because I don’t do anything anymore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotOneNotTwo in regards to your deleted tweet I believe the answer was 125,000 but please correct me if I’m wrong because I’m very off today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jocelyn90028 We should give it back but I’m sure Mexico doesn’t want it 🤣 (apologies to any of my followers that are Texans)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GFano2 Hold our yearly sacrifice of course. Oh wait we don’t believe in anything so there’s no rituals to do 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Custodela You’ve recommended this movie to me before and I still haven’t watched it yet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Custodela 🤣 awesome maybe I accidentally took peyote that’s why I’m hallucinating serpico yet replying to the wrong tweet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Custodela This makes me think of dr strangelove but I know it’s not that. Like I said I’m off today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Custodela How did I reply to this? I thought I replied to the Serpico question. Oof I’m so off today I think I need to get off of here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Custodela And I’m not a hippie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lizzicochrane Stop stealing my packages 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#OccupyMitch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shreedelo I’m constantly saying this: the voter fraud of the election was McConnell and Graham getting re-elected. However there are stupid people in this country that voted for those buffoons<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@UncleSaltyJr1 I’m with you! Counting down the hours until beverage time. Please tell Lady Luck to give me a call because I really need to get some too 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevens Honestly I really love that you sang the preamble of the Declaration of Independence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GenericBologna @CheyenneDhraga made a good point about Twitter limits saying I believe they think they are preventing people from using automation and bots to generate massive amounts of followers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GenericBologna Did you get suspended again or is this still your current situation?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Barrow4Parker Why not? 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevens Beautiful thanks for posting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shreedelo He actually wrote save the USA . What a joke. We wouldn’t need saving if he didn’t mess up the country<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Empath_g_app I actually love all of my scars and tattoos and I have a lot of both. I used to hate that I’m so pale but they both show up better because of that. I’m too depressed tonight to post pics though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoseSage6 Thank you. I’m sorry you’re dealing with this too. No sleep is the worst because it’s really my only solace<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Why do I keep getting this message?  https://t.co/WNAx8xaiNV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LornaMarieDavid Pretty much anything that I’m passionate about. Especially if a conversation has started with an argument that has false facts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bee_coast It’s my favorite outfit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Something funny is going on. Every time I open the Twitter app it says “tweet not sent” and under that it says “whoops you already said that” In case you see double tweets from me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robtaco4 @bettyberger105 Awwww you’re so lucky. She is too. What’s her name?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robtaco4 @bettyberger105 That’s wonderful. Pets are the best. Pictures please if you don’t mind. It would brighten my day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@libe613 @netcom_cosmic I’m a houseguest right now. It’s my friend’s toilet. He knows it’s going bad. He’s at work right now and I just don’t want to bother him with this. Thank you again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robtaco4 @bettyberger105 That’s awesome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robtaco4 @bettyberger105 Yes I tend to go overboard with stuff myself ! Vodka for me. I was trying the deep breathing this morning but it didn’t work<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@netcom_cosmic Thank you! Sorry I just saw this tweet. I’ve been too preoccupied<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@libe613 @netcom_cosmic Thank you for all of your help. I really do appreciate it<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bettyberger105 @robtaco4 Thank you. Yes you’re right about that I used to be prescribed it<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GhostOfJustin1 And cut you like you want me to 🎶<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@libe613 Thank you. I have the lid off. The chain was off I reattached it but the part on the left won’t stay up to stop the water from flowing. I have it rigged with a pen holding it up right now.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@robtaco4 Thank you same to you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robtaco4 Thank you. Mine have been the worst in years too unfortunately. The ones that happen for no apparent reason other than my brain not connecting properly are the absolute worst but I also tend to bury things too much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThewigglywormSj @tedcruz If you were a serial killer active in the late 60s &amp; 70s in SF known for sending taunting letters with symbols to the police you might also be Ted Cruz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jocelyn90028 I’ve honestly cried about things more this year than my entire life prior for real<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jocelyn90028 I saw that. I have no words anymore for what’s happening<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keysfins @CarlBovis I tried looking it up too. I’m no botanist or horticulturist. I love the word floofy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@latinpain Cool thank you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keysfins @CarlBovis I wasn’t sure thanks. I’m looking at them on my tiny iPhone 6s screen and my eyeglass prescription is over 7 years old<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@haslett_chad 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@latinpain What radio station?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarlBovis Are they pussy willows?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robtaco4 I had a never ending panic attack last night. I’m surprised I ever fell asleep. I hope you feel better<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fras99 It’s never too late even if it’s just knowledge from the streets or what not. I try to learn something new everyday<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@williwillchilli Thank you for your response I appreciate it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guys/men serious question and I may lose followers for asking but why would you choose to jerk off over having sex with a woman? (She’s great in bed and you know it too)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GhostOfJustin1 Awesome I love it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@petehasabeard Finish our drinks or smokes or edibles and call it a night. I’m m exhausted<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@davida76321 A fucking theocracy that only suits them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sevro18 It’s a jelly 🤣 part of my ancestry I’d French Canadian eh. I love you guys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GenericBologna You’re probably under some ridiculous suspicion and suspension<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@avra_cadaver This is when we told our cat he would no longer be needed for trumps toupee. He already gave so much for the next one 🤣  https://t.co/DUWUvv2msK<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DromVladicZinn Damn just when I thought you couldn’t be more sexy 😉😇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GhostOfJustin1 We are all good. Everyone doesn’t see it that way. I sound like a fucking Marco Rubio scripture tweet 🤣 Have you heard the good news? Senates turning blue in January<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GhostOfJustin1 You ok?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JLVOTE_Politics Never feel bad for being who you are honestly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ConradBain4 @JLVOTE_Politics I agree completely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JLVOTE_Politics Nothing wrong with being awkward bro. My phone actually tried to autocorrect to awesome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jDub_NowUKnow I find myself to be witty, intelligent and hilarious but I also find people like myself that have to declare that annoying so follow me if you choose. I followed you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The last 4 years have been utter madness but today for some reason I feel like I’m living in a horrible knockoff sequel to the cartoon alternate reality we’ve been living in. In my real life not just with everything else that’s going on. Fuck this shit sideways without lube<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BCOOL333 Reprehensible buffoons<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cpdagosta I also told him Jesus doesn’t appreciate him tweeting and that Jesus doesn’t like him. That tweet didn’t get reported though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@4ever_days Camels, elephants, men and women<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Eiggam5955 In 2020 everything is just a suggestion 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andyJ_w0ng Hopefully your supervisor knows that you’re a great worker. I wish I had better advice for you. I want to say try not letting ruin your mood but easier said than done. 💙💙💙<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cpdagosta 🤣 That’s awesome. All I did was tell Charlie to go F himself and called him a few names<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SANJOSEMAILMAN Every day in actually Monday in 2020. A really bad Monday<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cpdagosta I’ve said way worse to others on here and nothing has happened but I’m going to be good from now on. Although when I say that it usually doesn’t last.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cpdagosta I was suspended for the very first time responding to him. I avoid him now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nathaliejacoby1 You missed me but it’s all good. If you get a chance I’d appreciate being on the next list<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Because more than half the states – including most of the key battlegrounds – don’t provide a grace period for ballots that arrive after Election Day, it is likely 25,000-50,000 ballots nationwide were ultimately rejected because of USPS problems.  https://t.co/RR3y6HrZQ3<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KatWebheart I fall asleep to forensic files every night<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MikeB174474434 Yes! Exactly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeB174474434 And don’t spend time worrying what others think of you because they really aren’t thinking about you as much as you think they are<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@milhaus64 If it’s not already in your book add cheese, shavers and q-tips<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MamaSouth It’s 55 here in Massachusetts right now. It should really be 30 with snow on the ground<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmlettTony @FLOTUS @WhiteHouse Forced and unnatural pretty much sums up trumps presidency<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nixw20 @AngieFrost21 You’re such a wonderful person I wish there were more of you in this world<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@squishmallows Right. Working retail is hard enough during normal times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SherryJoWard @ImSpeaking13 @Just_ReneaR I’ve heard stories ha. Preposterous I say. Pics or it never happened 🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WhitLuvsBauhaus @PrdLiberal7 Oh sorry I hope you feel better and at least get a nice buzz from the robitussin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chipfranklin The gop brainwashes the vulnerable. They make promises they will not keep but throw in stuff about the dems wanting to kill babies,ban guns, and god. There are too many uneducated people in this country<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ellenr49Ellen @ErikssonHill Damn that was quick. Why does that sound familiar 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DromVladicZinn @GiovannaNardoz1 Ha well I enjoy the relief. What a feeling 🤣I won’t go into details<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DromVladicZinn @GiovannaNardoz1 It’s awesome and gross at the same time 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In a little more than half an hour it’s going to be December 1st and the temperature here in Massachusetts is still going to be warmer than Orlando, FL #climatechange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GiovannaNardoz1 I’ve used a neti pot and it’s no fun. It does help though but I don’t feel the need to do cartwheels after using it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DTWIESE There are many morons among us and to think people fear a zombie apocalypse we are already in one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SherryJoWard @ImSpeaking13 @Just_ReneaR But then I have to be told about my shenanigans because I don’t remember them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@inkr3dibl3_k Intelligence and humor are my biggest turn ons<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GuelfiJohn And his followers are too brainwashed to see. This really is some dear leader stuff. I bet they have shrines of him next to their gun racks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It seems the weather is crazy everywhere today but there’s been a shitstorm in dc for the last month actually the last four years<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ImSpeaking13 @Just_ReneaR I hear that. I’m always doing silly things sober that you would think would happen while drunk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trumpsajerk @covie_93 I tried<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DTWIESE Love you too. I’m full of love tonight for some reason. It’s probably the vodka<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ErikssonHill Ha I thought you said resister bother<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@covie_93 Tell them to move to Florida because that governor doesn’t give a fuck about anyone (sorry to the good ones in Florida)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@covie_93 Why are people so stupid? Why? what the hell is going on? I’m not going to say what I really think because I need to behave<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonWickenhagen @MeidasCeejay That’s what it usually is here this time of year at night and snow on the ground<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It just went up to 63 #ClimateChangeIsReal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@annabkrr Wow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeidasCeejay It’s crazy. Yes one of my friends in Florida was telling me that today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GAGary49 Apparently it was snowing in parts of Georgia today #ClimateChangeIsReal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s 61 degrees right now here in Massachusetts on the last day of November. What kind of Climate Change sorcery is this? Hmmm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mutternature Maybe request to have your name put on a resister list if you’d like more followers @Just_ReneaR tweets great lists<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nixw20 Are you ok? We love you too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CherryDank I met AJ McLean when the Backstreet Boys were at the height of their fame in the late 90s I was getting a tattoo and he walked in. My tattoo artist was his tattoo artist. I wasn’t a fan but got his autograph for my sister<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ImmoralishMe Cheese any kind of cheese. Made the mistake of buying it at the dollar store once... ONCE. It tasted like plastic<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ReneeAlida I cannot stand polenta and my dad knew yet he said if you don’t finish that in such and such amount of time I’ll keep adding more. My brother tried to help by eating it but we were caught. Over 30 years ago and I still remember<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t know about you but whenever I tell someone I’ll behave it usually means I have no intention of behaving<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@trschmidt85 I’m so sorry. Wishing you both the best<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nixw20 Back in the day I almost joined the Marines. Scored really high on the ASVAB test. Unfortunately I smoked a lot of pot back then so that was one of the reasons I didn’t enlist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sevro18 Or you could even eat ice cream while in the tub<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wobbledance1 They all put the “con” in concession<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EMaxfieldMoen @JasonMillerinDC Indeed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TonyShnark Or their “supporters” or fans<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@3SidecarsPlz Especially not Ted Cruz’s turkey because you know it’s dry and tasteless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@starwarsdcfan @kayleighmcenany Exactly. She should be looking for a new job not stalking news reports about our wonderful new president<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GhostOfJustin1 🤣 I’ve been in a public bathroom and somewhat knocked on my stall door and I answered them “ come in”<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Skyler4149 It’s a term for a hot woman I believe<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>A very good thread to read<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TG22110 @HeidiMafreak I once read that instead of using facts to argue with conspiracy theorists use a more outlandish theory. E.g. them: “the moon landing was fake” you: “Pfft you believe in the moon?”<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Patrice_Brost1 It doesn’t have a strong scent to me and because it’s a whipped mousse like texture it covers well. I have large pores and it hides them too. I hope this helps<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Tochinoshin33 From what I’ve seen it seems they’re spending more money looking for it than what the treasure might actually be worth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tochinoshin33 Kind of like watching trump looking for evidence of voter fraud<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@fuckmaps11 Believe I know the feeling but I’ve been on the opposite of that as well thinking of ways to end it unfortunately<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fuckmaps11 I wish you weren’t thinking like that I first thought like that when I was 7. I developed an irrational fear of death<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Angie1Francesca Happy birthday!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WSKirkland13 @BravoWWHL @Bethenny I think the RHONY reunion is an hour and WWHL is on at 10. They have it as an hour and a half long. It’s happened before a few weeks ago on my channel guide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mocraig13 Is stupidity a pre-existing condition?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KaiaSinclair I’ve felt off all day. Not myself, just don’t feel right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BravoLove12 @beckermbabe And her daughter had that accident with her finger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouluxeH My phone just shut itself down and the battery was at 100%  then drained down to 10% right after I responded<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BravoIsLife This was one of my least favorite seasons but I was also in a bad place in my life when it originally aired so I wonder if that’s why I didn’t enjoy it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DEONDERRICO When she said that it really hit my heart<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DEONDERRICO I am so glad you will be there for awesome Dawsyn’s surgery! Your mother GG is a wonderful women. I love your entire family 💜#TheDerricos<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grandmagrit Louche and also another word that rhymes with louche<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan He has childish nicknames for everyone he doesn’t like. It shows his level of maturity. Sadly this appeals to his supporters because they have the same level of maturity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TLC Can’t wait to watch tonight’s episode! #TheDerricos<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IAmDawnM The rosé and coca-cola @SonjatMorgan was drinking on the #RHONY Mexico trip<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Powamowinstarot I am just so amazed the way Mars retrograde has been messing with my electronics. Everyday it’s something new. Never would have known that’s why but thanks to this I know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nutcroft @lux1992 @bell517 @RHOGossip He kind of looks like a low rent Jeff Goldblum<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KekePalmer Enjoying certain wholesome things balances me out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KaiaSinclair Thank you, that made my day 💜<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Powamowinstarot I was thinking about you today and hoping you were ok considering what happened yesterday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Powamowinstarot Rest, relax, recharge. I hope you feel better soon 💜<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AquariusUnite Absolutely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JLily10303 The excuse will be “we don’t have the resources for something like that” utterly ridiculous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Powamowinstarot Yes my cellphone charging cord is acting up. Wow<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@beckermbabe @hwivesfanatic Yes definitely. She used to be one of my favorites.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beckermbabe @hwivesfanatic That clip of her yelling at John over the phone from last season was quite an eye opener.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OneLuckyGirl_28 Yes and Aquarius is my sun sign<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@syndrome22q1 @FaZeRug @Ewok @itskrisstar @brawadis @rudedogreyes @OmarGoshTV @davidmweissman @NewSpirit2020 @WWEArmstrong @ScottBaio Looking good Justin! Yes very handsome. Thank you for all of the information you give us about 22q. You rock!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Powamowinstarot Thank you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RHONJ_OBSESSED Same. What a joke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Powamowinstarot All of that energy they put into doing evil should be used for good. It’s terrible and sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllCelebPolls #RHONJ &amp; #RHONY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DEONDERRICO Love your family 💜 love your show 💜<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@heathert4ylor @queensofbravo Life is not a cabaret!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsjeffepstein When I first met my ex our mutual friend told him “this is the only girl I know who can drink you under the table”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@officialgogos @Showtime 1988 I was 10.A fan in Adams,MA won MTV contest @belindaofficial took over their house. Guy my mom knew was going. Asked for autograph for me.

<|startoftext|>@realwivespolls Maybe Frank Catania’s girlfriend?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Powamowinstarot I’m sorry that you had to deal with that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Realitytea Ramona acted like a child. Leah’s party was awesome it was amusing seeing some of the ‘wives out of their element there. Lu will do anything to have all the attention on her but Dorindas recap of Lu was worth it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HousewifeFan08 Wow I’m surprised that Kathy’s sister Rosie would be pro-Trump. Thank you for making these lists<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Powamowinstarot My sun, moon and rising are all fixed signs. Aquarius, Leo and Scorpio<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@queensofbravo YESSS!!! Love her! Definitely the rookie MVP! Happy birthday Leah! #RHONY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SlaineElyse Thank you! That was beautiful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MJMcKean Sometimes it is the best conversation you’ll have all day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@queensofbravo I think it’s interesting that both Denise Richards’ and Lisa Rinna’s current husbands were both once married to Nicolette Sheridan #RHOBH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllCelebPolls @DorindaMedley @BravoTV @Andy I love Dorinda and will miss her, however I didn’t like how she was this season. I understand she was going through a lot but constantly bringing up the mugshot of @CountessLuann was too much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grandmagrit The pro-lifers are the same ones that protest wearing masks with the “my body, my choice” Absolute nonsense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beckermbabe @lisarinna I agree. Beautiful love it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidmweissman I’m voting for Joe Biden and my vote is the vote that is going to make a difference. Pass it on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllCelebPolls @BravoTV @Andy Thank you I was hoping you would do this poll! There’s also an article saying @DorindaMedley has dirt on @Andy that she’s threatening to release which I absolutely do not believe. It’s sad the fake stories coming out about this. I love Dorinda!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RHOGossip I don’t believe it. I think someone was leaking fake stories to page six<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TLC @karenederrico @DEONDERRICO It’s wonderful that they have 14 children because we need more people like #theDerricos in this world<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TLC no other show makes me smile so much #TheDerricos<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Powamowinstarot Scorpio<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beckermbabe @housewives_stan Oh I forgot about Jennifer A<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beckermbabe @housewives_stan Siggy, the Aprea twins, Amber Marchese, Danielle Staub, Kelly Bensimon, Jeana Keough, Alexis Bellino, Ramona and Carlton<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beckermbabe @housewives_stan Oooh I would love to know who is on your list<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TLC @khadeeniam I love this show! #TheDerricos are a wonderful family! Thanks to @DEONDERRICO @karenederrico Their children will go far in this world 💜<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NPR “Vote like your life depends on it” @MichelleObama -It really does more than ever now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cloudedbuterax Hi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grandmagrit Immature name calling just like trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SlaineElyse You are a very classy lady.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProjectLincoln 🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Realitytea I think Ramona is jealous. Elyse is beautiful and classy. She doesn’t need Ramona for fame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BravoWWHL I love it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnny67208 @hwivesfanatic Season 7 episode 17 “London Calling”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RBReich Very well said. Sadly some do not realize not voting for them or not voting at all is in fact helping to re-elect trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@animalIife Unleash the geese!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BravoWWHL I really hope to see @SlaineElyse she is the best!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WillCoForests Very interesting. I didn’t know that thank you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BravoTV Definitely @SlaineElyse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeddyWilson Great list. Makes me nostalgic. I had a lot of these on cassette<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshtigerhill You are awesome!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CountessLuann I really hope @SlaineElyse will be there! She needs an apple. Love her!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EricHannett @AnimalPlanet You guys need your own spinoff show !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricHannett @AnimalPlanet I really enjoyed this episode. My favorite #northwoodslaw episodes are when @EricHannett and Lt Bill Boudreau work together. They are the best!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricHannett @AnimalPlanet I cannot wait to watch this episode tonight! My favorite show and a special episode with 2 of my favorite conservation officers!<|endoftext|>
