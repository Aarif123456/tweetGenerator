<|startoftext|>Aw! Congrats 😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just had a family member die from cancer, I don’t think I can bare to see it happening to one of my idols too 😢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is disgusting! The arts is a real effing job! All those movies/tv shows/concerts/theatre performances you watch, and music you listen to, are the arts! And it’s hard to put on any show and record albums! This is sickening! #savethearts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He is the most sweetest guy you’ll ever meet and my heart just breaks! @TomParker look into cannabis oil hun! It really does work! Had a friend stage with 4 lymphoma and it shrunk after she took it! X<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So the arts industry is not a real job? It’s just a fantasy daydream? Ok let’s take away music, theatre, live shows, TV, movies and see what you say then? 🤬<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It’s just missing a hat 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are all HUMAN! We are ALL equal! REAL change starts by treating EVERYONE as a human and not putting people into catogries! CHANGE starts by accepting everyones cultures and beliefs! If you can’t do that, then you are a raciest!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Honestly some police officers think they’re above the law and it’s disgraceful! You took an oath to serve and protect not to harass and kill for the sake of it! By wearing a badge, you’re supposed to be setting an example for your fellow citizens!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@icknield44 @ja54kki @JimMFelton Speaking from experience. Ever since I had the flu jab the only thing I ever got was a mild cold type symptom so yes flu vaccines do work.

<|startoftext|>Why do some healthy people with no underlying issues get affected by the coronavirus and some recover? Could it be that some people’s genes are easily be manipulated? Is the outcome of recovery due to a person’s personal DNA? Just a theory 🤷‍♀️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NathanSykes Life isn’t a snack right now. It’s ruining people’s lives....there’s nothing good about this in any way shape or form. And the worst thing is, this “virus” was deliberately created to kill off the vulnerable in society. Think about it....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ac_actors @LAWacting I still haven’t got enough acting experience to put together a proper show really so I had a monologue type one filmed  https://t.co/HM3pdtz6HL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My sis has been transferred to a hotel near the hospital she works in so she don’t have to travel an hour and a half every morning. 4 weeks without her. No I’m not gonna miss her 🤣🤪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FionaTomlinson @JPMarksDWP I won’t but I did hear scare stories that’s why I was worried<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrsMazzafiore AMEN!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I have severe asthma and I haven’t been sent a letter from the NHS saying I’m high risk. Looks like I’m not high risk then 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes I’m listening to my own EP cos I’m bored with nothing better to do 🤣  https://t.co/jdLh3ZiaZo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry forgot to say earlier! It was magical when my whole street clapped for the NHS! Couldn’t go out and unfortunately as I have the corona symptoms but I opened the windows and stick my hands out! GO NHS!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YEEEHAAAAA MY NEW EP IS NOW OUT! GO GO GO GO!  Josie Jackson - EP by Josie Jackson  https://t.co/jw4uiFgwxl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomParker Good lord you’ve joined the Tik Tok squad.....I’m outta here! 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And this explains why my asthma has been flaring up the last few weeks. I better not have the coronacrap! And yes I have a bloood pressure machine at home.... And I’m gonna stop going on the 111 website cause it keeps saying call an ambulance. As if they aren’t struggling enough  https://t.co/DeEjPYZkIy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shockproofbeats Question is what were YOU doing outdoors? 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@STU_ACTOR Don’t they go forward? One less hour in bed? 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Usually round this time I need to have my asthma tested but I can’t get through to my asthma nurse! I’m proper scared now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@musicnotes Oooh thank you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BreannaTracey Keep trying. I waited almost 2 hours for someone to answer and finally got it rolling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got another assessment too as I’m self employed. They’re really pulling out the stops as they know so have severe asthma. God bless them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So my universal credit was done over the phone and surprisingly they were quick. I was like wait, I didn’t get bullied and harassed? A few simple questions and it was done. The lady on the other side was so helpful! A+ Woolwich job centre! C<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomparker you don’t need a bday to wash your ass. Just hop in the shower and wash you ass using soap/shower gel with water then dry off with a towel. TADAAA! Who needs toilet paper? 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anyone know where I can get the sheet music for Part Of That World from Little Mermaid? Might film myself doing a cover of it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayMcGuiness Leave for about ten minutes or until the pastry is a nice golden colour. ENJOY!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayMcGuiness Lay one sheet of pastry at the bottom and put the mixture it. Then cover it using the other sheet of pastry. Use vegan butter to do a wash. Cut some slits in the pastry and put in the oven. Maybe at 180 degrees for about five minutes then turn down to 160. C<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayMcGuiness Make sure you preheat your oven beforehand. Grease the pan with some vegan butter, and also grease the grease proof paper using the butter. You want two sheets of pastry, one on the bottom. Another on the top. Size it accordingly. C<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayMcGuiness For the Easter eggs, if you have any frozen fruit lying around, and some pastry left over, you can make a fruit and chocolate pastry desert. Defrost the fruit over a hot water bath and melt it. Then once it’s melted add the chocolate. You’ll need a pastry pan c<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayMcGuiness Then when it’s almost defrosted, wrap it in some pastry, melt some vegan butter and use that as a wash. Then place in the oven at 180 degrees for about 10 - 15 minutes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayMcGuiness Well Jay, if you have vegetables and some pastry, you can possibly make a sausage roll and have the pickled onions on the side. Also you can cook a vegetable side dish so you get a balanced diet. To do the the sausage roll, first defrost (if frozen) the sausage c<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Waiting on @itsconnie147x to create @mcfly sims and have them bang each other 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BreannaTracey They’re closed now their office hours are 9-5. That’s probably why they kept hanging up....  I mean actually go to the post office. Take the documents and do it face to face....not ideal.  I used both bank cards and my provisional license to verify plus passport...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BreannaTracey Or you can actually go to the post office (if they’re open) and do it from there....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BreannaTracey The hell? If you trust me do you want me to try?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmac708 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mastermate91 @theJeremyVine Trying but I’ve been advised to self isolate due to an underlying respiratory condition. Coronacrap will kill me just like that if I get it.

<|startoftext|>@MKarlDawes @daisychain241 @jeremycorbyn Had your chance NHS is gone now! People think brexit and getting immigrants out is more important than saving our public services<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@13sarahmurphy It’s nice you lot are trying but the tories wont budge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chunkymark I could have easily put a bet on that 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People thinking that we’re gonna have this deal are delusional it’s gonna get rejected you watch 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Egypt will always be the land of the Pharos, my ancestors. The outsiders came and stole OUR land and turned it into this God knows what it is now......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve always been ashamed of my Egyptian heritage because of the links to terrorism, but fuck it. My family are Egyptian and I have Egyptian blood and my ancestors are the fucking Pharos! I was christened as a Christian Coptic and that will never change!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seeing @BigTheMusical on Halloween! Expect to see costumes on the front row 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RPD_Bear @jdportes @peterjukes @bbclaurak It needs to pass parliament first 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shockproofbeats @CllrAConnaghan I seriously have a question and if I sound stupid then I’m sorry, if there’s really an ish between north and the south, then why don’t they want a border? The fact that they don’t want a border says a lot about the peace there.....kinda makes sense to unite and MOVE ON<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You see? My ancestors invented that word....  Learn some ancient history before pulling out the raciest card.   Oh and FYI, I have Egyptian family 🖕🏻  https://t.co/hsTcqm9mv6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GinaaG12 And now that’s stuck in my head 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>just because I’m white.....this word belongs to the Pharos, my ancestors so ya’ll keep your traps shut!! You took a word and turned it into something ugly! Egypt will always be the land of the Pharos and nothing else! You think you’re mad? Well we’re fuming! RANT OVER<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I see anyone else talking about the “N” word, I’m actually gonna go mental. I kept my mouth shut for long enough. My ancestors had everything stolen from them including their land and now ya’ll calling me raciest for using the language my ancestors used c<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayMcGuiness BAHAHAHAHA KARMAAAA 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NathanSykesHQ @NathanSykes I don’t want joggers I want new music 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously sick of work back door discriminating me cos of my disabilities; my autism and my foot condition.  Cut my hours, cancel my shifts last minute and giving me the health and safety bullshit.  I’ve been patient enough now, time to escalate this shit 😡<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jubileeline what’s going on? So I can’t get to North Greenwich?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Religion is a big part of my life. Baptised as an orthodox but go to a Catholic Church. I created this playlist as an escape from the real world. This is my time between me and God 👍🏻    https://t.co/JUg5XXmFQ9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is my boss being antsy with me all of a sudden? I’ve been on crutches for god knows and now it’s a “health and safety” issue? I don’t even use my crutches behind the bar, wtf? I even move barrels and lift boxes.....and the doctor said that I was fit to work....WTF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The sooner this infection clears off the sooner I can go out 😭  And I hate going out in public when I got a cold sore, people look at me like I’m a whore 😭  It’s because my immune system has been compromised not because I’ve been sleeping around 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lalaerato And that’s how ya’ll spread herpes 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@issagaro @amagoo13 @kirstar19 You see the older votes outweighed is in this election and the previous ones, we didn’t vote because we TRUSTED the older generation to make the right decision as we’re seen as stupid and uneducated.....no more!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@issagaro @amagoo13 @kirstar19 And who caused this housing crises? Margret thatcher. Is she of the older generation? Yes. There’s my point right there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@issagaro @amagoo13 @kirstar19 Exactly my point, people in government are that of the older generation who caused this. Nothing but greed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amagoo13 @issagaro @kirstar19 I’m saying that the older generation became greedy and made them unaffordable for us!! Council houses that were bought for cheap are now being sold at eye watering prices!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Anyone wanna get involved with @benefit_bash? Head over to see what you can do 👍🏻👍🏻 @BBCCiN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wanna go into the studio and finish my EP but this effing infection is blocking my vocal chords 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SOMEBODY DO SOME RESEARCH ON THIS!! Your body could potentially be creating new antibodies by just going on the tube!!! THIS IS LIFE SAVING WHERE ARE ALL THE SCIENTISTS AT?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I survived any other night with this infection...hmm I always wonder if being exposed to the filth on the underground is causing my immune system to recognise threads of bacteria more quickly.....maybe that’s why I’ve got a low grade fever....natural antibiotic? @NHSMillion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elljs_ Omg 😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elljs_ Wait WOT?!! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elljs_ HAHAHAHA!! They’re all bloody your age! Have them all 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheShiresNo1Fan Yeah I know but watch the pain, if it gets bad get it checked. It might be the nerves. It put me on crutches for six months: I have the very same issue. Currently being fitted with a custom sole xx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheShiresNo1Fan Get them checked out it might be what I have, I’ve had it since childhood. They may have to create a custom shoe sole x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There’s actually a few good looking fellas in this bar......which of you is gonna ask me out? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He looks so young though like WTF?? I feel like a ducking cougar 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good lord this cute bar tender was just flirting with me.....WTF?  Do I get his number? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well I survived the night.....still sweating like hell though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok google....tell me how to cure sepsis naturally....WITHOUT ANTIBIOTOCS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I had to wait 16 hours to get my appendix out.....like what if it burst during this time....STOP CLOSING HOSPITALS, INVEST IN TRAINING STAFF AND STOP WASTING MONEY! Cunts 😡🖕🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ps. That’s not an excuse not to vaccinate your kids.....VACCINATE YOUR FUCKING CHILDREN!!!! 😡🖕🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There’s another option....see it my body can fight this infection without pharma crap....just herbal tea, lemon and honey and yoga....I mean come on, what did people do back in the day when they got sepsis? Surely they must have done something.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I could see on the nurse’s face when I went to sign in at A&amp;E that she wanted me to get checked but lord I’m not waiting 12 hours to be seen! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elljs_ And finally out of nowhere a fever of 40! Thought I was being brave noticing the symptoms....I feel like time waster 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elljs_ Literally when I had the pneumonia last time, I got the extreme symptoms like four weeks after....started exactly the same, first the fatigue for four weeks, then the low grade fevers, then the chest pains....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elljs_ and see my GP next week, after working for 16 hours straight, I’m going home.....was sent home by my agency too, they were like dude you look ill, BYE! Fuckers I need money 😡🖕🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elljs_ Nurse told me I have to wait for hours and my fever keeps bouncing up and down like a yo-yo! Not really, last time I had pneumonia, I wanted five hours and I had a fever of 39.5!! There’s a lot of high priorities and I have to work tomorrow....gonna sleep it off c<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait WOT?!!!! 😱😱😱 @TheBeachBoys @RipItUpTheShow should I go? 😱😱  https://t.co/xH7ndmmUYz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh yeah up at 5am and working until 10pm on no sleep 😂😂  Same again tomorrow 😂😂  A caffeine overdose is required 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’d really appreciate it if this fever can fuck off! Good thing I’m in the cloakroom today where I can sit on my assit and do shit 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarlaMarieUK Please do, in times of uncertainty, I’d love some inspiration 👍🏻<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@paultinay @jeremycorbyn Trust me much safer than the bus, London buses drive like lunatics honestly 😂🙈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeratoconusGRP I’ve actually noticed an improvement since cross linking but I guess I’m one of the lucky ones....might try the contact lenses to see if it can repair the shape<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elljs_ I possibly need one....take it easy LOOOL! I work 16 hour shifts that’s not in my dictionary....I’ve already had a spinal scan which came back normal but that’s for another issue c<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I wanted to help a charity close to my heart @BBCCiN and this inspired me to organise @benefit_bash, I used all my savings just to put on this gig and raise money for it. Change starts with you! Make it positive, not disruptive 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But this guys, is not the way to do it! Like Michael Jackson once said, if you wanna make a change then look at yourself. It starts with you! And do it in a positive way 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>start a recycling initiative (eg. Make plastic bricks and house the homeless), try get funding and start a charity to help people upgrade their cars, or even start a charity to get people to install solar panels. C<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look, I get why people are doing the climate change protest but come on, there are other ways! Here’s a few examples c<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh and there goes the lights.....Easter needs to hurry up so this electrician can finish fixing my wires 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Got so many hospital appointments coming up my head is spinning. Today I had a breath test. In like two days I’m getting my asthma checked and later on that day, an MRI scan to see how damaged my nerves are. Then a week after I got another two breath tests. I’m exhausted 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stuartleech @Jackie_A_Long @KingLouXCIV @kirstar19 Literally! I mean you go to a new place, every electric meter is different, every appliance is different, yes most is common sense but when it comes to electrics or gas, it’s very important you know which button to push and that’s why you gotta ask questions!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MahoganySzn I’m coming soon! 😂 #NewEP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now I’m gonna head over to @FanficIntro to post future episode teasers! Last episode was uploaded yesterday so check it out 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure if that’s true but it’s claimed that the Virgin Mary appeared on it at some point. The historical mystery it holds is absolutely phenomenal. I really hope it can be restored. 😔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My heart absolutely breaks hearing about the Norte Dame, I’ve been there a few times and it’s one of my favourite places on earth. The moment you walk into that cathedral, a strong sense of spiritual security just hits you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Day off! If someone sees me going into the recording studio, you have my permission to slap me 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HMRCcustomers Trying to get this sorted out and I can’t get through the web chat, is there any chance this can be sorted here please? Thank you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCCiN Thank you guys!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RabMacPhoto @accountingetc @doctor_oxford I’m not saying ditch pharma, I’m saying look where a substitute is possible and it varies from individual to individual but I though I’d share some cancer findings with people and what you do with the info is your choice especially as brexit is looming 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RabMacPhoto @accountingetc @doctor_oxford There has been some studies which proved effective but not always reliable but speaking from experience, every one around me with cancer who I told to get cannabis oil saw their cancer markers drop. It’s worth looking into and don’t always rely on the pharma 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RabMacPhoto @accountingetc @doctor_oxford Cancer can be killed using cannabis oil and THC but no one will tell you thay because it puts the pharma out of business 👍🏻 (that’s why it’s illegal). I’d go to a country where it is legal and call it a holiday 😘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HMRCcustomers Ok thank you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HMRCcustomers There’s no options.....just the final result and that’s it<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Karen04110206 @RachelWood77 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People kill each other daily and it’s just gotten to the point where I have no words to describe anything. If I’m silent it’s not because I’m heartless I don’t care, it’s because I’m numb and don’t know what to say 😔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With all the sudden loss happening right now, it reminded me of a song I wrote a few years ago after loosing two of my cousins in one week, ever since more of my loved ones have sadly passed on. This song is so relevant right now  https://t.co/o9RxLAjPYR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaxGeorge @ChampionUSA @JDOfficial Looking like ooh la la 😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GirlsIRate I had a fab time!! Thank you again!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@elljs_ ELLIE! 😂🙈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarlaMarieUK ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh so I’ve emerged from my songwriting cave to Instagram and Facebook being down. I actually thought there was a glitch on my phone, turns out it’s everywhere....THE VIRUS HAS SPREAD! RUN! THE BUG WILL INFECT YOU AND TURN YOU INTO A ROBOTIC ZOMBIE! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had an awesome time at @GirlsIRate today! Thank you ladies for an amazing time! Can’t wait to attend future events! And thank you @CarlaMarieUK for being an amazing advocate and a huge inspiration! I love listening to your wisdom! Keep rocking 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NathanSykes Lol you thought you looked bad, I looked like this 😂  https://t.co/3qCC5MmCIl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At the @GirlsIRate songwriting event! Sitting in a room full of aspiring songwriters is just WOW! 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NathanSykes That song presented you as a solo artist! Loved it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elljs_ Ew 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elljs_ 😂😂😂  https://t.co/G8UeX50svR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Se_Railway Please just sort it! 🤦🏼‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Train services in England.....they’re either delayed or cancelled but we’ll put the price up anyway 😡🖕🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Se_Railway It’s finally arrived, it was the 9:17 Hayes service from London Bridge. This is two days in a row now! Late comers cost the NHS millions! I leave two hours early for a 30 minute journey and I’m still late! 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course the trains are delayed again 😡 @se_railway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elljs_ @JayMcGuiness Call it a dinner date 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elljs_ @JayMcGuiness 😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pizzahutuk @JayMcGuiness @elljs_ Only if I win 😜<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pizzahutuk @JayMcGuiness My plus one would be @elljs_.  Now pizza express have been doing vegan pizzas for a while but now you’re putting your hand in the cookie jar and I wanna try it. But which is better? There’s only one way to find out...  https://t.co/5EVD4RePDT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Janetnbecks @WendyPinder @JayMcGuiness @Kazzie_P_60 She will be missed a lot 😔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elljs_ THIS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not only that, they didn’t even consult my clinician about my treatments and he was furious! I’d choose the NHS any day then this private crap!   Yes back in the day private was excellent but now it’s shit 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So basically let me tell you a story, a NHS service was outsourced to a private company and this private company taking care of me under NHS expenses are awful! Putting me up for treatments I don’t need just so they could bill the NHS $$$! 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Se_Railway unreliable! Every time o travel with them, trains are either cancelled or delayed! This is unacceptable! 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Might show you guys one day how I make my infused veggie rosemary pies 😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaisyMooCow @UmbryKane @GordonRamsay @breadstkitchen PREACH IT WOMAN!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AstonMerrygold Thank goodness he’s ok! We take our NHS for granted and they continue to do amazing work!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kazzie_P_60 @WendyPinder OMG WHAAAT! NOOOOO! RIP girl! I’ll never forget our shenanigans 😔   At least heaven gained a beautiful angel 👼   Cancer can go to hell! 😡🖕🏻  #RIPWendy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@VirginTrains Should really lower the prices tbh it’s getting out of control now, when I can’t afford something so simple such as trains, then there’s something seriously wrong with the whole system....everyone should be able to afford to travel on a train!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VirginTrains That’s no use I need to be in Manchester by 11:15 and the date for the time I need is still unaffordable. There has to be another way....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VirginTrains Ok I’ll give it a go thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VirginTrains 13th March 2019, I’ll be returning the same day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@virgintrains I don’t have a lot of money and I’ve been given an opportunity of a life time but it starts really early......please please please make that cheaper for me! Thank you<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That’s what the tories want, an insurance privatised system which penalises the most vulnerable in society and charge eye watering amounts of money. They want the sick/disabled/elderly/poor dead. They cost nothing once they’ve been wiped from the face of the earth 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WTF IS THIS SHIT? A LOT OF MY MEDICAL CONDITIONS IS STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL! WHO GIVES THEM THE RIGHT TO DO THAT?! 😡<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Mark_J_Hudson @jeremycorbyn @chunkymark Well think about it that way, vote anyone and I mean anyone just as it’s not the Tories 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mark_J_Hudson @jeremycorbyn @chunkymark Between you and me, I’d vote Green Party but they’re not big enough to win an election, I’d rather have labour than tories. I just can’t stand the Tories with their cut cut cut cut everything manifesto 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mark_J_Hudson @jeremycorbyn @chunkymark But what you’re failing to understand that if he opposes it, then people will still moan about him not respecting the vote blah blah blah. It doesn’t matter what he does, people just enjoy bashing and smearing him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidglen23 @jeremycorbyn By sanctioning the sick and disabled? Rising homeless? Unaffordable housing? No social housing? Rising train fares? Selling off the NHS and privatising it? Police and fire fighters cut, police and fire stations shit down. Funding stripped from public services? Dare I go on?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn @chunkymark All you people having a go at Corbyn for helping brexit but just remember you’ll also have a go at him for not respecting the majority vote. It’s a lose lose situation! Brexit wasn’t Corbyn’s fault, it’s the raciest xenophobic public’s fault! c<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>There’s something about connecting to the listeners which is powerful, sharing your experiences and having your audience relate to it. So I really hope you like the album. It’s personally my favourite yet. Thank you guys for your upmost support! Love you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Although I’m not the best singer, there’s just something about the emotion of this album which hits you right in the feels. If you’ve ever dealt with anxiety and depression, you’ll definitely listen and be like, oh damn I get it! I understand! C<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So now my album is officially out, I’d like to talk a bit more about it. It’s such a personal album and I put my feelings out in the open, especially with my battle with depression. Some of the songs on there still leaves a tear in my eye. C<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Carolin38918619 @Philpaulbert @weyside7 @chunkymark @jeremycorbyn @UKLabour This is all talk. I’ll only believe it until I see something actually done. It’s been lies lies lies from the start and I don’t believe anything no more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeratoconusGRP You should see your opticians regularly and regular changes in prescription is one of the main indicators. The sooner it’s picked up the better 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeratoconusGRP First three days were brutal, but the pain eases. I find that sunglasses help with the light sensitivity and headaches 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Philpaulbert @weyside7 @Carolin38918619 @chunkymark @jeremycorbyn @UKLabour The only way to stop brexit is to have another referendum and that’s not gonna happen. No party can stop it, you have to respect democracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GwynneMP @chunkymark LIESSSSS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BIRDTHOTTING Lemon, and honey should give my immune system the boost to get rid of it without the pharma poison....I’ll keep an eye on it though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BIRDTHOTTING Unfortunately I’m coughing up brown/yellow gunk and I’m struggling to breath. Now if I go to the doctor, I’m gonna be on antibiotics and to be fair, in trying to stay clear of it as it weakens your immune system over time. There’s no fever so I’m not too worried<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope you enjoyed the science lecture. Adios!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So in order to try stop the cornea from changing shape, I’ve had a procedure called cross linking, where they use a reacting agent and UV lights to try harden the cornea. Recovery is a pain in the butt but it’s worth it in the end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now, your cornea is supposed to be a nice round shape, here’s the different corneal shapes for normal and a person with the condition.  https://t.co/7bzzLnLHBm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel like I should tell you more about the eye condition I have as not many people know about it. It’s a condition called keratoconus where basically the cornea changed shape. It’s a mainly inherited condition and of left untreated, can cause blindness c<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyway things are all happening at once, this chest infection I’ve been ignoring is finally catching up with me....do I continue to ignore it? I think so unless I go blue in the face then yeah, that’s when I’ll do something about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve been in the hospital all morning for check ups but I’m finally back home and I’m my own bed. Slept all day and now I can’t sleep. On the plus side, I’m slowly starting to walk normally without my crutches so all that physio is paying off! Can’t get ahead of myself though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry guys usually by now I’m building hype for my new album coming out next month, but I’ve just had eye surgery and I’m plagued with infections so I’ve been down and poorly. Really trying to get better before the @LawsonOfficial gig on Tuesday! I don’t wanna miss it 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There’s actually a lot of agencies out there who PAY you for being an extra! WHY WAS I DOING IT FOR FREE THEN?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RachelWood77 I love the whole album Rach! All the songs are amazing! Can’t wait to hear the new stuff....can we have a sneak preview please please pretty please!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you can’t wait for Walking in the Shadows to be released next month, amazon have a preview for it right here!!   https://t.co/JxWwKvVQBq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3 cheers for public transport letting me down AGAIN! Now I’m not gonna make my surgery AND ITS COSTING @NHSuk A LOT OF MONEY! I LEFT AN HOUR AND HALF EARLY FOR WHATS A 40 MINUTE JOURNEY! 🤬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course the @jubileeline messes up on the day of my surgery! This is why @NHSuk patients CAN’T MAKE THEIR APPOINTMENTS!! I left super early and still!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did the government release a virus into the the community or something? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I honestly don’t know what’s wrong with me, I can’t seem to shake off this bug....started with a mild fever, then a runny nose then went away for like a day before my throat started to kill me like a bitch followed by cough and now another fever....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@labourpress @chunkymark @MGreenwoodWW I’m on crutches and I’ve been told I’m fit to work....let that sink in....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow, you have the money to buy bags but have the audacity to beg people for money? 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve reached that point in my life now that I trust no one....NO ONE! I will always go with my gut instincts from now on because they’ve never steered me wrong, when my gut sees a bad apple, they are one!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t you love it when someone indirects you then lies about it? How stupid do you think I am? 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least I have a career, what have you done with your life honey? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PEOPLE LIKE YOU NEED GO BE HANGED AND ELIMINATED FROM SOCIETY!  AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE MOST FUCKED UP THING IS? I HAVE NO REMORSE FOR SOMEONE WHO TRIES TO SCAM ME THAN KILLS THEMSELVES! I’LL BE CELEBRATING!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Being someone who’s been through the suicidal thing I hate telling people to kill themselves, but to scammers constantly calling and trying to get my bank details, I’VE REACHED MY LIMIT! STOP CALLING TRYING TO SCAM ME AND GO KILL YOURSELF YOU CRIMINAL! C<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>FINALLY SOMEONE SAID IT! AMEN SIS! Acting is a really uncertain career, you can have all the success in the world and still need a 9-5....well for me it’s a 4 - midnight since I work in a bar 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only in London can you have a degree, work a full time job and still be homeless......#ToriesOut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpotlightUK Here’s my monologue style showreel!  https://t.co/HM3pdtz6HL #Spotlight #ShowreelShareDay<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RachelWood77 @Camila_Cabello @ShawnMendes It’s really sad, they are human beings too! They deserve the right to be normal and not be bombarded by fans! And they certainly don’t have to apologise for being normal!   They are human beings too.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MicrosoftHelps Will do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MicrosoftHelps YOU GUYS ARE ANGELS! THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU! It finally worked 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MicrosoftHelps I was trying to do that earlier but I kept getting distracted, will try again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MicrosoftHelps Hmm very strange, I can create a new folder on another user but not on my admin one.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MicrosoftHelps I’ve lost count how many times I rebooted the system 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MicrosoftHelps I’ve got a third party shell app thing and tried to disable some applications, that didn’t work either, I changed some registry values, that didn’t work either.....  This is such a bizarre situation 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MicrosoftHelps I’ve done the clean boot, it came back negative, the issue is still there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MicrosoftHelps For now this is the only issue experienced unless I stumble on another glitch 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MicrosoftHelps but nothing seems to be working, the issue happened after the last update.....any ideas on what might be causing this? Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MicrosoftHelps hey guys, I’m trying to create a new folder but the explorer completely freezes! I’ve tried a few things which unfortunately hasn’t work, doesn’t seem to be an issue with shell or the registry....I’m doing an account scan to see if it brings up any issues c<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@survivingactors @ActressSkye I agree, in the acting world, you’re not always guaranteed a job, I often have to work two jobs just to live, it gets to the point where that job consumes me and I can’t go to auditions! Finding that balance is hard!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BIRDTHOTTING Nothing at college is easy, not even acting 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jubileeline Well I usually travel between North Greenwich and Westminster there’s a few loud parts between those....it’s gradually got worse.....both ways<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jubileeline I believe the tracks are due a replacement, it’s getting dangerously loud now.....  I’m this close to wearing earplugs which puts me in danger as I need to hear my surroundings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There goes my wheelie bin 😂😂 #StormAli<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I’m glad you joined the movement guys! Love you all so much  https://t.co/nZD2H58aQH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@INKEDJXY GRRRRRRR I hate peolle like that, actually go through the shit then judge you morons! I didn’t get where I am today by “folding”. It took years of therapy 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@INKEDJXY @NathanSykes His face is like what the hell, who spiked my drink? 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MFBoom @chunkymark All she does is destroy the wheat fields 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All this “affordable” housing, how about ALL housing should be affordable! The housing market is out of control now, there has to be a cap!  https://t.co/LCOR87p0q4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funding? What funding? It’s all cut cut cut cut cut ✂️😡 #ToriesOut  https://t.co/XdZ6EbuW2P<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Would love to have @mcflymusic @mcflyharry @itsDannyJones @TomFletcher @DougiePoynter perform at my gig to raise money for BBC Children in Need 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KlTKD69 @JayMcGuiness This is so amazing! Of at times it’s not easy especially when you have certain medical conditions which require you to eat meat but the fact one is trying is a big achievement 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayMcGuiness Well, here’s my big fat vegan dinner 😂  https://t.co/r8KaFmXD4a<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I got my audition through for The Voice AND ITS WHEN IM ON HOLIDAY 😭😭😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve reached that stage of I’ve had enough of people treating me like crap, I’ve snobbied up and become a bitch....yup, the only way people stop treating you like shit is to make them fear you and show them who’s boss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomFletcher Muesli is yum! What’s wrong with you man? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here’s what I think of that, TAKE YOUR NANDOS COUPON AND SHOVE IT WHERE THE SUN DON’t SHINE 😡🖕🏻  https://t.co/x3MxRoYWdG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amagoo13 As @chunkymark would say, GET RID OF THESE TORIES, VOTE CORBYN, ANOTHER WORLD IS POSSIBLE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amagoo13 That makes me so angry like PUBLIC SERVICES ARE BEING CUT RAW, NHS CUTS, CRIME GOING UP TO THE POINT WHERE I HAVE TO USE SELF DEFENCE BECAUSE THERES NO POLICE! GET RID OF THESE MONSTERS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Magician147 At the end of the day you just have to trust that God will give that woman strength to decide what’s best for her. And for me that’s enough. Whatever her decision, then I support it, that’s what the bible teaches, compassion 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Magician147 But I also consider the circumstances and what is happening behind closed doors.....obviously it’s wrong if a woman is using abortion as a contraception, that’s wrong but you just don’t know what’s happening, maybe a mental issue is driving towards that decision c<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Magician147 Abortion is a really hard thing to talk about, especially coming from someone who actually is unable to conceive naturally....people will have different opinions and such, as a catholic I’m against abortion myself c<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Magician147 I can see where you’re coming from Shaun and I respect your opinion but at the end of the day, a woman has to make a choice to decide what’s best for her and the baby, you have to consider that maybe for example a woman doesn’t want a baby being born into poverty or such c<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Magician147 Oh powowowowow erm well...I wasn’t expecting a response at all....like this is one of those tweets where you should just scroll past and roll your eyes in disgust 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Magician147 can I just ask a general question? How long should a man last before he explodes? Just a curious George wondering 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarbaraMcMahon8 My appendix almost ruptured and thankfully I was seen within an hour and a half.....the NHS desperately needs more funding<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cravinmcguiness 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everybody else: yeah I agree with the bully, the person bullied is nothing but an attention seeking twat who just needs suck it up and get over it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>*Bully continues to bully a person. Person finally has enough and stands up for themselves*.  Bully: oh stop sulking, I can treat you the way I want and there’s nothing you can do about it. You’re just causing needless drama  C<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@INKEDJXY She do me she do you 😂  https://t.co/FC512MIJbC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@INKEDJXY FFS 😂😂😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s quite funny how when I first suggested the idea, everybody simply laughed and said it was not possible. No support whatsoever.....  Just you watch what this little midget can do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just waiting to to finalise things with the venue and possibly waiting to hear back from a few sponsors #FingersCrossed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I might have chosen my headliner and finished shortlisting the final acts 😱 #Benefit_Bash  First of all, I would like to thank everyone for applying to take part in this, the winners have been chosen and will be contacted in the next two weeks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any businesses interested in sponsoring my concert?  https://t.co/rMfCOOlfR0 @BBCCiN #BBCCiN<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AndyBrownMusic That song is so beautiful Andy! Love it so much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyBrownMusic The message you sent didn’t come through, are you able to send it again please as I have a few acts lined up now 👍🏻<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@INKEDJXY Will you shut up! You’re beautiful! I’m the one who looks like they’ve been slapped with a fish<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@INKEDJXY I would not recommend it, it’s a painful recovery, was forced to have cosmetic surgery on my broken nose and it’s a really painful and long recovery! You’re beautiful 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn’t it quite funny how when you finally stand up to yourself and stop talking that person’s bullshit, they then go around and spread bull about you 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@indianablue222 Lovely to see you too!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheShiresNo1Fan EEEEEK omg maddie I haven’t left the house yet! Stay put, I’ll be there as fast as I can<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wowzers! The Starnow ad has exploded with applications! I’ve got my work cut out now 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoyalMail My friend has it, I’m just furious that’s this has happened, my guesses is that they’ve been stolen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@INKEDJXY @TomParker Whoops I was meant to reply to the cat getting run over tweet, screw dyslexia 😂  I love Grease too 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@INKEDJXY @TomParker WHY WOULD ANYONE DO THAT? BOOOOO 😡👎🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never in my life did I think I’d ever put on a charity concert but I have and it’s happening! I might be digging into my savings for this but it’ll be worth it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomParker oi oi what’s going on here? Btw hope you don’t mind me asking but I’m holding a concert for BBC Children in Need and if you wanted to, I can give you a slot for the DJing if you want, I’ll contact your management on the email in your bio 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tylershouse @AndyBrownMusic @theshiresuk Yeah but I only have until 6pm and my friend who actually has the tickets is working until 6pm....I’m not sure if I’m allowed to collect them on her behalf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tylershouse @AndyBrownMusic @theshiresuk Well apparently my friend has the tickets and she’s working but she’s gonna see what she can do. I’ve contacted RAH who said they’ll try help....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The venue just confirmed the date!! #BenefitBash  https://t.co/lkvZrKK9J6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyBrownMusic @theshiresuk guys I really need your help please, The tickets for tomorrow have been lost in the post, thanks to Royal Mail and I can’t afford to buy another seat, are you able to get me and my friend in please?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be a part of something special 👍🏻  https://t.co/iHEjo8aBns<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TicketmasterCS I’ve followed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoyalAlbertHall You absolute angels thank you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TicketmasterCS Yes, she’s given up hope now, she even rang them up. I’m not sure if they’ll respond to another email on time that’s why I’m tweeting you here....can you send me the email to email them on and I’ll get her to email you guys but I’ll label the email as urgent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TicketmasterCS My friend called them up and they said there’s nothing you could do but I know that’s a lie because on your website, it clearly states that if your tickets don’t arrive on time, they can be collected from the box office as long as the person brings the card and some ID<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TicketmasterCS Yes, no definite answer from anyone. They’re my friend’s tickets so I’ll get her to contact you. Please can you reprint a new set and get them collected at the box office tomorrow. My friend will bring some ID and the card used to purchase<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RoyalAlbertHall hey guys, my friend bought tickets off ticketmaster and the tickets haven’t arrived yet and the concert is tomorrow. I have contacted ticketmaster with no luck, they won’t answer. Can my friend use the booking reference instead to get in? Thank you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TicketmasterCS why you replying to everyone else but ignoring my request? Help?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TicketmasterCS I’d appreciate if you didn’t ignore my tweet and sorted the issue out! The tickets ordered were lost in the post and the concert is tomorrow! I need a new set of tickets reprinted to be collected at the box office!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you @RoyalMail and @TicketmasterCS for losing my tickets to @theshiresuk! Is it that hard to reprint and have them collected from the box office? The concert is tomorrow with no sign of them! 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsconnie_x @theshiresuk Dude it was a joke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsconnie_x @theshiresuk Fuck it I’m getting box tickets for myself<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Was so into jamming to @BigTheMusical and I almost missed my stop ffs 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markwil147 This thread is hilarious! *gets the popcorn*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amagoo13 @UKLabour @chunkymark You’re right Andrew, vote labour or Tory brexit is happening no matter what. People need to accept the democratic vote and take brexit out of the equation when making their decisions about the future of the country<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewreader @BidnessClass @CentristSlayer @IamMuffnMan @NHSMillion No it’s not cruel, he’s not in pain, no treatment doesn’t matter, you should NEVER take away someone’s right to decide what is best for their child 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewreader @BidnessClass @CentristSlayer @IamMuffnMan @NHSMillion No we are not blaming the healthcare, we are angry that the parents were denied a right to TRY treatment elsewhere!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BidnessClass @viewreader @CentristSlayer @IamMuffnMan @NHSMillion So what you’re saying is if he turns out disabled, then he’s doesn’t have a right to live? Sounds like Tory principles over here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewreader @BidnessClass @CentristSlayer @IamMuffnMan @NHSMillion Who cares it’s what his parents would have wanted and they took that RIGHT away from them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewreader @BidnessClass @CentristSlayer @IamMuffnMan @NHSMillion No they didn’t because if they did then they would have not gone to court to ban him from leaving the country! You’re a disgrace to think that’s right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xaviholden @CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @KarenStopHate @OwenJones84 TAG ME OUT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BidnessClass @viewreader @CentristSlayer @IamMuffnMan @NHSMillion Thank you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@candlemakerCS Ok will do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewreader @BidnessClass @CentristSlayer @IamMuffnMan @NHSMillion I wasn’t talking to you I was talking to someone else, by randomly tagging me to try “correct my opinions” is rather annoying. You wanna post something, don’t tag!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really wanna see @JesseMcCartney live one day....please come to the UK 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigKevTheWanted I might do it depends on if I’m working and it will really be on the work rota....I don’t wanna book it only to find out I have to work...I really wanna go too 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@labourpress @chunkymark Smearing poor Corbyn again you monsters! 😡🖕🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@candlemakerCS Oooooh I’m looking for a venue....you don’t have a PR system in place do you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KyrenWilson Omfg 😭😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NHSMillion You’re becoming a profit earning privatised bulkshit that’s what’s happening...#ToriesOut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyBrownMusic YEEEEEEESSSS!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amagoo13 @eurotyke @UKLabour @chunkymark I believe that’s how the tories got into power too.....don’t take it out on labour hun, they might be shit and won’t stick to their promises but they are not damn corrupt like the tories are who take the tax payers money and stash it overseas! 🖕🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BidnessClass @Trad_Thot @viewreader @CentristSlayer @IamMuffnMan @NHSMillion It was there is a medium.....but the family couldn’t afford it so he had to die....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amagoo13 @UKLabour @chunkymark Exactly! 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amagoo13 @UKLabour @chunkymark It really annoys me that people aren’t gonna vote labour all because they support brexit! Our poor public services! Just forget brexit for one second 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigKevTheWanted meirda 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalvinKarpenko @xaviholden @YagudMiriam @KarenStopHate @OwenJones84 Um can you tag me out of this? You’re not talking to me no more<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Trad_Thot @viewreader @BidnessClass @CentristSlayer @IamMuffnMan @NHSMillion Exactly! It should be about patient care not money!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trad_Thot @viewreader @BidnessClass @CentristSlayer @IamMuffnMan @NHSMillion Private care is all all about the money and nothing else....I’ve seen the work the NHS do and I used to be on my Dad’s private insurance and I have had surgery in a private hospital before and I can tell you, the NHS is heaps better....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trad_Thot @viewreader @BidnessClass @CentristSlayer @IamMuffnMan @NHSMillion Thanks babe....recovery is supposed to last two weeks so I’m kinda being impatient....but I’m gonna see my doctor just to a general check up and make sure nothing funky is going on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trad_Thot @viewreader @BidnessClass @CentristSlayer @IamMuffnMan @NHSMillion To be honest I think private is even more dangerous, as long as the money keeps rolling in, they can diagnose with whatever they want.....  With the government system, there’s some sort of control as funds are short so they’ll be a little bit more accurate....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trad_Thot @viewreader @BidnessClass @CentristSlayer @IamMuffnMan @NHSMillion Even now, I sense that something is off.....I’m still getting severe pain a week later after my surgery and I’m always weak and worn down....I need to get back to work 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trad_Thot @viewreader @BidnessClass @CentristSlayer @IamMuffnMan @NHSMillion The amount of times they diagnosed me with constipation or IBS....all they did was an ultrasound which shows nothing! Finally someone picked up that it was my appendix....I was running a fever and they ignored that too...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trad_Thot @viewreader @BidnessClass @CentristSlayer @IamMuffnMan @NHSMillion Spot on!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trad_Thot @viewreader @BidnessClass @CentristSlayer @IamMuffnMan @NHSMillion Even rich hospitals are dangerous.....as long as you’re paying for your treatment, the doctors can do whatever they want to dry out your wallet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trad_Thot @viewreader @BidnessClass @CentristSlayer @IamMuffnMan @NHSMillion They didn’t care they wanted him dead that was the motive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trad_Thot @viewreader @BidnessClass @CentristSlayer @IamMuffnMan @NHSMillion hospital and was informed that my appendix was the size of a golf ball!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trad_Thot @viewreader @BidnessClass @CentristSlayer @IamMuffnMan @NHSMillion And most of the abuse came from agency nurses! They have no bed side manners whatsoever! They even discharged me without checking mn over properly so they could free up the bed. I had to go to my GP who marched me back to A&amp;E. I went to the different c<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trad_Thot @viewreader @BidnessClass @CentristSlayer @IamMuffnMan @NHSMillion The whole system is in neglect. I was unfortunate to have my appendix out recently and all I saw was the elderly lying in wards being ignored and when the nurse did finally turn up, they were so rude! They treated these people as cattle with no feelings! C<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trad_Thot @viewreader @BidnessClass @CentristSlayer @IamMuffnMan @NHSMillion They wanted to damage his brain even more than it was and made sure he had no chance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trad_Thot @viewreader @BidnessClass @CentristSlayer @IamMuffnMan @NHSMillion Yes and it must be investigated right away or other vulnerable people would be put in danger!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trad_Thot @viewreader @BidnessClass @CentristSlayer @IamMuffnMan @NHSMillion He even breathed on his own when the tube was removed! He wasn’t completely brain dead! Something is being hidden!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trad_Thot @viewreader @BidnessClass @CentristSlayer @IamMuffnMan @NHSMillion And not gonna lie, I don’t want a few bad apples ruining the whole of the NHS, they whole trust is doing wonderful things. It’s just being ruined by suits with private insurance WHICH IS BEING PAID FOR BY US 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trad_Thot @viewreader @BidnessClass @CentristSlayer @IamMuffnMan @NHSMillion The parents should sue the hell out of them I mean I hate that it has come to this but a strong message needs to be sent out. When you step out of line you need to be punished!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trad_Thot @viewreader @BidnessClass @CentristSlayer @IamMuffnMan @NHSMillion Disgusting! Where’s the dignity? Breathing tube was mouldy too? Eurgh!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trad_Thot @viewreader @BidnessClass @CentristSlayer @IamMuffnMan @NHSMillion Exactly! I mean the NHS would save tons of money not caring for him no more and they would become Italy’s problem now.....it’s a win win. They’re hiding something<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trad_Thot @viewreader @BidnessClass @CentristSlayer @IamMuffnMan @NHSMillion Exactly! They must have purposely deteriorated his condition to speed up his death....they were too scared to be found out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trad_Thot @viewreader @BidnessClass @CentristSlayer @IamMuffnMan @NHSMillion Yeah! But whatever happened, something ILLEGAL must have gone on behind the scenes in the court!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trad_Thot @viewreader @BidnessClass @CentristSlayer @IamMuffnMan @NHSMillion Or maybe it’s the Tory policies about the disabled....I mean disabled people are really expensive to run, why would they wanna risk having another disabled person being born into the world? So that they can carry that cost burden? No, they need to die 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trad_Thot @viewreader @BidnessClass @CentristSlayer @IamMuffnMan @NHSMillion It’s all about pride and socialism. By handing him over to the Italians, it’s admitting defeat and that would look bad for them.....they desperately wanted to protect. That or that they were bribed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trad_Thot @viewreader @BidnessClass @CentristSlayer @IamMuffnMan @NHSMillion What makes me wonder is how the court were allowed to make this barbaric decision! It makes me think they were bribed for this outcome! 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trad_Thot @viewreader @BidnessClass @CentristSlayer @IamMuffnMan @NHSMillion Exactly I mean who cares if the Italian treatment doesn’t work, the family can be rest assured that they did everything they can to save him and they were robbed of that decision! It makes me sick!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@David_C69 @NHSMillion Already have one, I’ve put a flower on it 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trad_Thot @viewreader @BidnessClass @CentristSlayer @IamMuffnMan @NHSMillion Exactly! Who cares about the medic mumbo jumbo, a family should NEVER have their HUMAN rights robbed like that! This has become more than one case now. It sends out a message that if someone becomes expensive to care for, just go to court who will happily murder them 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@David_C69 @NHSMillion I do this is the Tory doing there’s no limit to what they’ll do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Home Office: No we don’t wanna staff the NHS we’ve almost completed privatising it from its failure! Last thing we need is those disgusting immigrants coming into our country!   #ToriesOut  https://t.co/TbDQNIrsMv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigKevTheWanted Maybe a sex video 😂😂😭😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewreader @BidnessClass @CentristSlayer @IamMuffnMan @NHSMillion Would you like it if someone went to court to kill someone you love and not respect your decision about their care?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewreader @BidnessClass @CentristSlayer @IamMuffnMan @NHSMillion But they still shouldn’t have their rights stripped away and their decisions respected, people need to mind their own business and stop influencing the decisions of others....they wasted NHS money which could have been spent on the service to kill someone 😞<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@David_C69 @NHSMillion They bribed the court for them to lose the case!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@David_C69 @NHSMillion The government are gleaming with glee, a step closer to privation....LOOK THEY FAILED *behind the scenes* we praise the courts for doing the right thing, here’s a suitcase full of money<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@viewreader @BidnessClass @CentristSlayer @IamMuffnMan @NHSMillion Who cares if there’s no treatment, Italy was prepared to fund it! The NHS would not longer carry the cost burden. They should have been given that right regardless! If that was your own, you would have done everything you possibly can to save them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This could also give the government an excuse to pass a law where families can prove they have the funds to care for a disabled person for life or they’ll be subject to euthanasia 😡🖕🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a start of a new law being passed stating that allows doctors to kill off anyone they want for the sake of providing a free space without having to go to court! The elderly are the most in danger. DISGUSTING! England has turned into Nazis!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What happened to Alfie was heartbreaking! It makes me even more sick that he was BANNED from seeking treatment in another country which was willing to fund him! Just proves the lengths people will go through to stop the unleashing of more expensive disabled people 😡 #RIP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😭😭😭😭  https://t.co/H4Wx0kxcWP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigKevTheWanted Good luck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skarslovs @Skars_tw @NathanSykes @tayweath @billboard My heart is breaking....maybe one day 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NathanSykes @tayweath @billboard Aw!! Such a lovely interview and I wish you all the best @JayMcGuiness @MaxGeorge @TomParker @SivaKaneswaran<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Magician147 @ww_uk Aw! It is hard to resist those 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xaviholden @CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @KarenStopHate @OwenJones84 Hope so but unfortunately the problem with London is, too many rich folkes who love the loopholes in the tax avoiding system....it needs to be stamped out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xaviholden @CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @KarenStopHate @OwenJones84 I voted lib dems once and they slapped me in the face, big time! Buddy buddy with Tory principles, never again 😷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xaviholden @CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @KarenStopHate @OwenJones84 That’s what I’m hoping<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xaviholden @CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @KarenStopHate @OwenJones84 Well I gave labour a seat regardless of how much it made my stomach turn but I made sure my vote didn’t go to tories or Lib Dems....I mean if everyone where to cast one vote each on one of the smaller parties and one for labour....could get the Tory bums out...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xaviholden @CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @KarenStopHate @OwenJones84 Ah ok<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xaviholden @CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @KarenStopHate @OwenJones84 I don’t like tories, Lib Dem’s or labour....but given what I was given on the ballot I had to choose between NHS privatisation or brexit....I pick NHS and public services over everything and quite frankly I didn’t believe the torie lies and I didn’t believe the labour lies c<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xaviholden @CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @KarenStopHate @OwenJones84 At first I thought brexit was a good idea but it’s become a platform of hate and racism and I want nothing to do with it no more! That’s why I’m keeping my distance, and before you ask no I did not vote in the brexit bullshit, it was a moment of weakness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xaviholden @CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @KarenStopHate @OwenJones84 Nope.....but I did give labour a seat since there was only one for green and one for women’s and I used the spare vote for labour....one seat is better than three....anything to get the tories out...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you don’t wanna vote labour or tories than vote for Green Party! 👍🏻  https://t.co/BuCuc8bsKQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulAdams72 @AaronBastani I’m an actress and I need to be flexible. I want that flexibility where I can work when my acting work is slow but also take time off to film which could be months on end and still have a job to get back to....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulAdams72 @AaronBastani stating that they would like to work zero hours....of course I can see where that could be abused so make it illegal for an employer to put that on a contract as a standard....I don’t know....but banning isn’t the answer c<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulAdams72 @AaronBastani Banning zero hour contracts won’t be affective as some people like me rely on the flexible work. You need to find a way that these zero hour contracts are not abused, for example one idea would be to ban offering them in the first place unless the employee signs c<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xaviholden @CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @KarenStopHate @OwenJones84 Tbh I couldn’t care less about brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalvinKarpenko @xaviholden @YagudMiriam @KarenStopHate @OwenJones84 That’s why I’m voting for neither labour or conservative....I’m all for the Green Party and that women’s party!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigKevTheWanted Beer is yum, I like it 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amagoo13 You know how I handle spam callers, I literally verbally abuse them now! That’s the only way, that will scare them from ever ringing my number<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarenStopHate @perigo_minas @CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @OwenJones84 I just did refer to last tweet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarenStopHate @CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @OwenJones84 I didn’t even tag you why you responding<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarenStopHate @CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @OwenJones84 Why you tweeting me then to disagree? I only tweeted a general opinion, by targeting and tagging me it looks like you’re attacking me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarenStopHate @RooBubba @CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @OwenJones84 So can I ask why we are fighting since we both share the same values and opinions? What I posted was exactly what you just said but you came at me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RooBubba @KarenStopHate @CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @OwenJones84 I just don’t wanna get involved with brexit since I’m not British, I get a lot of abuse as it on a daily bases this will make it worse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarenStopHate @perigo_minas @CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @OwenJones84 Because you judged me lol, I posted an opinion on a thread and you targeted me with your shit when I was being neutral<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To the two girls in front of me on the 161 to North Greenwich, it’s illegal to take pictures of strangers! Yes I have a chair with me because I’ve just had surgery and will constantly need to take breaks! And I didn’t get a phone until I was 13! Your generation is doomed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xaviholden @CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @KarenStopHate @OwenJones84 My principals is save the planet and labour aren’t getting my vote either...#VoteGreenParty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Se_Railway @jubileeline @markjesterselby @ronnieo147 Gees this is what happens when the tories are in charge! #VoteGreenParty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So pissed, there’s no @jubileeline and now @Se_Railway have delayed their trains too.....ALL I WANNA DO IS MEET @markjesterselby and @ronnieo147 😭😭😭 #Snooker #GiveMeABreak<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jubileeline Damn ok! Train it is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jubileeline is there currently no jubilee line at all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigKevTheWanted Tories: you wanna kill yourself, go ahead but don’t expect us to waste tax payers money trying to help you. You’ll be doing us all a big favour in this overcrowded country and saving us shit loads of money which we will use for our own luxuries, thank you   #ToryMurders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @KarenStopHate @OwenJones84 Good....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @KarenStopHate @OwenJones84 Well then if you’re voting for a party who promotes racism and treats its poor and vulnerable people like cattle and randomly deports British citizens then you have lost my respect, that’s the Tory principle and that’s what they believe in, not as bad as labour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @KarenStopHate @OwenJones84 And I really feel sorry for you, those principles you believe in are all Tory lies and corruption....all you care about is brexit and refuse to look at the bigger picture which is why I took brexit out of the equation when making my decision<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @KarenStopHate @OwenJones84 And there are many other parties you can vote for, like the Green Party, maybe make global warming a priority?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @KarenStopHate @OwenJones84 So will I, I will lose my EU citezinship too but it’s a sacrifice I will have to make to respect the democratic vote. I respect your principles I didn’t say I didn’t, I’m just saying Tory or labour, brexit is happening no matter what, the tories go against everything I believe in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @KarenStopHate @OwenJones84 Every party has made its share of mistakes I don’t agree with some of the labour policies either or the empty promises they keep making, but I’d rather have that then a bunch of greedy over paid business people who stash their income overseas to avoid tax!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @KarenStopHate @OwenJones84 Vote Tory and you’ll also end up with brexit....and a privatised NHS, lose lose, look at what the tories have done with the line of inhumaine austerity cuts....for once in your life think about what has society has become and take brexit out of the equation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chunkymark Bombing Syria and destroying innocent lives over nothing! 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RooBubba @KarenStopHate @CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @OwenJones84 It is great and it’s unfortunate that that the democratic vote has to over shadow that but I’m not going to waste my energy battling something which can’t be changed I’m just gonna focus on making the community a better place, I’d rather put my energy else where<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RooBubba @KarenStopHate @CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @OwenJones84 Probably because it was on a thread but yeah I couldn’t care less about brexit too busy recycling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WOOO  https://t.co/yd4SZarHwL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarenStopHate @RooBubba @CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @OwenJones84 Well next time when I post an opinion, DONT TAG ME okay? I believe you can’t read I’ve been neutral in all this yet you Tory kissers always think you’re right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarenStopHate @perigo_minas @CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @OwenJones84 No you were attacking me with my views lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peterkwilson @Conservatives Rip it up and throw it in the recycling 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amagoo13 Go on Jeremy! 👍🏻<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RooBubba @CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @KarenStopHate @OwenJones84 Well if you’re really that passionate then why don’t you get off social media and do something about it, you wanna make a change, than be my guest but like I said, I didn’t vote, I’m team neither and I think the whole thing is stupid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@namhmai @ameliathompsonn That guy is gonna lose his job 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Barcabhoy1 @HarryBradyCU I wonder how Jeremy Corbyn is a bad leader? All I see is nothing but a man who wants to make the world a better place. At the end of the day, every party breaks their promises. I’d rather not have a privatised NHS....I don’t care who’s in power just not the tories or Lib Dems<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Barcabhoy1 @amagoo13 Because she bribed to stay in power....I mean she saved shit loads in austerity cuts, it’s being used on war and bribes not on our public services #Criminal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theresawoman @CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @KarenStopHate @OwenJones84 Well then if you hate democracy so much then why don’t you move to a country where they don’t believe in it, the public voted, it’s over, stop crying over spilt milk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theresawoman @CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @KarenStopHate @OwenJones84 You do realise I’m on the same side as you...I hate the tories just as much as you do.....all I’m saying is you just gotta accept the vote outcome which fucking sucks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ya’ll, if you don’t wanna vote labour at least vote Green Party! SAVE THE PLANET PEEPS! 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atifishaqueMO @jen05376 LOOOOOOOOOOL 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theresawoman @CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @KarenStopHate @OwenJones84 You didn’t lol but the majority did and before you call me brexit I’m team neither! I’m team save the planet and I think brexit is stupid. I’m just saying you just gotta respect the democratic vote....that’s how it works and yes sometimes it sucks but yeah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YagudMiriam @perigo_minas @CalvinKarpenko @KarenStopHate @OwenJones84 Yeah, Tories hate immigrants....look whats happening now with the common wealth people! Disgusting! Same motive which started brexit.......They couldn't hit the migration targets as too many people were coming in so they caused brexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SmoggyPower @chunkymark Because she bribed them lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@perigo_minas @CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @KarenStopHate @OwenJones84 Just look after the earth and the well-being of our public services! And help the homeless and the poor! And for goodness sake, recycle your rubbish or it’ll end up destroying the oceans and other habitats! And respect your fellow immigrants who help run this country! Bye!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@perigo_minas @CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @KarenStopHate @OwenJones84 No I simply said the public voted and thats the outcome there’s nothing more we can do now how’s that saying I voted for anything. I was a general comment. You can troll me all you like but it won’t change the DEMEOCRATIC VOTE. You want change? Go out and do it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@perigo_minas @CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @KarenStopHate @OwenJones84 I’m neither remain or neither leave! I’m after the Green Party lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@perigo_minas @CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @KarenStopHate @OwenJones84 Enjoy your privatised NHS since you can afford to fucking pay for private insurance! I simply find it childish that you’re only voting tories because they believe in brexit, tbh I couldn’t care less either way because I didn’t vote! I think the whole thing is stupid!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@perigo_minas @CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @KarenStopHate @OwenJones84 You don’t even know what I voted! You seem to assume that I voted leave.....but voting tories will?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@perigo_minas @CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @KarenStopHate @OwenJones84 Go on, tell Karen that who’s having a go at me when it’s out of my fucking hands! The public voted, she hates the outcome so she’d rather have more austerity cuts and a privatised NHS than vote for a softer blow...not saying labour are any good but it won’t be tories<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theshiresuk @BBCTheOneShow @BBCOne OH MY GOSH EIDHDJFJDJDJ AAAAAAAAH!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaxGeorge 😭😭😭😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarenStopHate @CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @OwenJones84 Well then instead of crying on social media, go to your local MP and ask if they can hold a second referendum rather than having a go at me for telling it how it is! That’s the only way you can reverse a vote! Draw up petitions and such, spread the word, you know....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YagudMiriam @CalvinKarpenko @KarenStopHate @OwenJones84 So basically what you’re saying is you want the tories to continue on this destructive path because you think Corbyn is an ass?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayMcGuiness my god what have you done with your header 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amagoo13 @BigKevTheWanted @natashal0uise @JayMcGuiness Good 👍🏻👍🏻<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BigKevTheWanted Let’s not! He looked like god knows what 😂🙈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andy_lawton @OwenJones84 You vote for brexit as well by voting Tory and Lib Dem’s as well as more austerity cuts and soaring house prices....true labour won’t keep their promises but I hate the tories and the Lib Dem’s and I’ll do everything I can to get the Tory bums off those seats!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @KarenStopHate @OwenJones84 And before you tell me I’m an immigrant and I have no right to use the NHS, I have a NI number and I pay a percentage of my wages into it every month!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @KarenStopHate @OwenJones84 Vote Tory and you’ll have more cuts and the NHS fully privatised which means you’ll need to BUY EXPENSIVE medical insurance to be able to afford the basics! But of course you guys can afford it.....c<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalvinKarpenko @YagudMiriam @KarenStopHate @OwenJones84 And before you call me raciest, I couldn’t vote because I wasn’t born in the UK! So I’m one of the burden immigrants who you’re trying to get rid of! But I have to respect what the British public voted for! C<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@daviemacaye @amagoo13 Let me put it this way, if you decriminalise drugs, you take a whole workload of the cops! What’s criminal about laying back and smoking a plant? It’s just like smoking tobacco and tobacco is even more harmful!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cravinmcguiness Come to the UK, save up like crazy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cravinmcguiness It’s not, a lot of budget brands in the UK are vegetarian and they don’t break the bank, or you can always cook from scratch, that’s what I do, I go to the market, get a ton of food for cheap then cook it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ameliathompsonn You haven’t seen how mine looks HAHAHAHA!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ameliathompsonn That’s why you have something called a fringe 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To sum up what’s happening right now: England: Russia are bloody terrorists! Russia: Well England, look at your track record when it comes to war  *Gets popcorn and puts feet up* 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chunkymark She’s a heartless monster! 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeratoconusGRP @Specsavers Not sure how effective it’ll be as my condition has advanced, to be honest, I like having glasses, covers my panda eyes,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeratoconusGRP @Specsavers Well I have very sensitive eyes so contacts aren’t suitable that’s why they gave me the laser option....if all goes well and my K hasn’t got worse, I can finally do for the corrective treatment and be done with my glasses for good..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KeratoconusGRP @Specsavers That’s the one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@INKEDJXY Any time! Just start off by laying flat on your back and imagining you whole body singing to the ground...it’s easier said than done! Took me 20 tries to finally manage to medicate and shut my mind off<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@INKEDJXY I find yoga helps!!!! I had the same problem!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Specsavers My optometrist adviced me not to get an update on my glasses because of my keratoconus, they wanna do a laser to stop the condition first (one year waiting list on NHS) then we can talk on permanent contact lenses<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amagoo13 Ah ok! Well in general, it makes me sick selling beer for that price but it pays my bills 😭<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DoctorGert @chunkymark This government needs to be overthrown before they cause anymore damage!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoctorGert @chunkymark They’re full of it and people need to open their eyes! There’s plenty of money but they don’t wanna give it to the NHS as it’s the process of privatisation. Purposely underfund it so they can say, it’s not working and BOOM! American style system 😡<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amagoo13 Another reason to visit Nottingham 👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We need to create a revolution and overthrow the government...WHO’S WITH ME? @amagoo13 @chunkymark<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DoctorGert @chunkymark Disgusting! No regards whatsoever then penalise hard working people on minimum wage when they don’t pay tax....🖕🏻<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chunkymark So this is where my hard earned tax is going....FOR THEIR FUCKING LUXURIES!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoctorGert @chunkymark Tories: “The poor, ill and disabled are a burden on society. They cost too much money to run and they don’t contribute. We want a country full of people who can actually contribute towards a rich and privileged society. Would you keep an old toy if it wasn’t working?”<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@universe785 @55krissi55 @jeremycorbyn @Conservatives I get that but it’s a two way system. If the tenants and landlords work together then there won’t be any problems, The the selfish few that ruin it for everyone<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You guys have no idea what the hell I was talking about.....producer talks 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ticking the single CPU option helps too as the processor is the main culprit for all that crackling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've gotta go wave RT and fiddle with the frequency then decrease the buffers to reduce latency 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well it will wreck again but at least I now know how to do it 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did I just fix the sound issues? OMG! I'm an evil genius!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It doesn't look like I won't be able to record the music video for the single then......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TBH I place the blame on that microphone converter I got because my new laptop didn't have a jack connection!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So tried to record my new single today and I've ran into issues after issues! The sound quality is terrible even with my new mic! C<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And I've already decided that it's gonna be the first single from my fourth album<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Guess it's up to me to decide then....I originally did say Insane was gonna be the next single, then I changed it to Inevitable and now I c<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SweetRiotMusic is this a pre April fools prank? Please say it is! 😭<|endoftext|>
