<|startoftext|>@DerWalt20 Maybe its because I dont know much about politics... but along the years I've noticed that, if the EFF is not fond of someone, they will rubbish every suggestion he makes.

<|startoftext|>@alfavina @PioneerPoone But in all Khosi.... Swallows won the game because of their good substitution, and we lost because of  our substitution.  The last 10 minutes of the game would have been enough for Zuma, compared to Parker who has come in with no difference in so many games<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alfavina Well understood<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alfavina My opinion Khosi...  If Zuma wasn't fit to play last night he shouldn't even been on the bench. We conceded in the last 10 minutes, at least Zuma would have been troublesome for Swallows in the middle.   Parker's legs are heavy now. Poor substitution costed us 3 points.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@eNCA @MbalulaFikile My friend was caught by police drinking while driving in a roadblock near Kliptown, they made him pay R500 and they let him go.  He could have caused an accident on the way after these corrupt metro police let him go. Our police are corrupt, start there!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The mistake that the ruling party is making is...  They think we will vote them again because of the historical background or because we are blacks that won't associate themselves with parties ruled by whites. Our blackness doesnt feed us.<|endoftext|>
