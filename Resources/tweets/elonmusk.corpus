<|startoftext|>@RGVaerialphotos It will be real soon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarcusHouseGame @bcart03 @nextspaceflight @NASASpaceflight Starship legs are one of the hardest problems. Externally mounted legs require shielding, which adds mass. Wider stance adds mass. Shock absorbers add mass. That said, we need better legs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bcart03 @nextspaceflight @NASASpaceflight Static fire is not risky from build site, but we need to clear the build site for early flights<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aholstein404 @flcnhvy @thesheetztweetz This is a subject of much debate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flcnhvy @thesheetztweetz Major upgrades are slated for SN15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flcnhvy @thesheetztweetz Many small improvements, but overall similar. Wiring is more robust, engines are more mature, nosecone is sealed better, etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesheetztweetz But that‚Äôs why we have SN 9 &amp; SN10<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesheetztweetz Lot of things need to go right, so maybe 1/3 chance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good Starship SN8 static fire! Aiming for first 15km / ~50k ft altitude flight next week. Goals are to test 3 engine ascent, body flaps, transition from main to header tanks &amp; landing flip.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @MarcusHouseGame Maybe start on that a year from now. Depends on how Starship progress goes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RationalEtienne @MarcusHouseGame Not yet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarshipFairing @MarcusHouseGame Not bad! We will definitely need more engines if we make the cargo bay all propellant, but it‚Äôs probably smarter than a whole new shorter external hull.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ReflexFunds @nickidk4 @pcgamer Dojo/Doge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PPathole @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Yeah, looks like marginal cost of launch will be less than $1M for more than 100 tons to orbit, so it‚Äôs mostly about fixed costs divided by launches per year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@speculawyer @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Exactly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Merlin is a strong local maximum design, but kerosene is suboptimal fuel, no matter what you do.   What matters is cost per ton to Mars. CH4 is the only choice imo. Important: O2/CH4 allows OF ratio of ~3.5 vs ~2.5 for kerosene, so ~78% of propellant is oxygen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@parstalberg @josh_bickett @ICannot_Enough @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Yes, but from a visiting American. Ah, the irony is just too much!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@josh_bickett @ICannot_Enough @Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 Yeah, PCR Ct was unequivocal at &lt;20. Doesn‚Äôt matter what method you use at that low a cycle threshold.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @rweb11742 The most amazing thing about rocket engines is that they *sometimes* don‚Äôt blow up! The amount of power going through them boggles the mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pcgamer We should just count the atoms at this point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @CharlesNOtrumps @rweb11742 Absolutely. Production/testing of rocket engines is over 90% of the problem. This is true in general. For cars, production is over 99% of the problem. That 1% inspiration is very important, but it‚Äôs less than 1% of the pain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @CharlesNOtrumps @rweb11742 Our first Merlin engine design was really bad tbh. Nothing worked well &amp; some parts didn‚Äôt work at all. 18 years later &amp; thousands of upgrades make it a great GG cycle engine.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@stonkmanup @michaelmina_lab They should be imo. If you get a blood pressure test, they tell you the number, not just if it‚Äôs high/not-high. There is not a clear consensus on what Ct value of what cov2 gene constitutes ‚Äúpositive‚Äù.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AstroJordy @erujabidi A little up &amp; down. Feels just like a regular cold, but more body achy &amp; cloudy head than coughing/sneezing. DayQuil rocks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaelmina_lab In your opinion, at what Ct number for the cov2 N1 gene should a PCR test probably be regarded as positive? If I‚Äôm asking the wrong question, what is a better question?<|endoftext|>

General public doesn‚Äôt realize quite how much of medicine is subjective or outright witchcraft.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhatsupFranks The number of PCR amplification cycles required to detect the virus is a rough indicator of your viral load. From what I can gather, you‚Äôre probably not infectious above 30 &amp; you probably are below 25. Sound about right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrSammy_H @max_roi @rossy65 This a great reference! Worth a read.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Case closed  https://t.co/pUYiJcAdD6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Soon  https://t.co/mWOpR7W8kk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PPathole Fwiw, lab I just spoke to thinks below 30 is accurate, 30 to 40 gets dicey &amp; above 40 is bs. Will talk to several more labs. There must be a graph of PCR amplification cycle vs false positive rate somewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lab I just spoke to said cov2 PCR detection (N1 &amp; N3 genes) below 30 cycles is reliable &amp; above 40 cycles is not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RationalEtienne @ryaneshea Note, this is not the spike protein. They don‚Äôt consider that reliable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RationalEtienne @ryaneshea Just spoke directly to a testing lab. Their main PCR search is for the N1 gene, unique to cov2. N3 is also sought, but is generic to other sars viruses. High PCR cycle count *does* give false positives, but they believe accuracy is good below 30 cycles &amp; 40 cycles is their max.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PPathole Strange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ryaneshea Possible explanation for the dramatic decline in cold &amp; flu prevalence vs prior years. If someone comes in with cold/flu symptoms &amp; falsely tests positive for cov2, they will assume they have it, when in fact they simply have some other form of seasonal cold/flu.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ryaneshea Moreover, lower the true prevalence, the higher the false positive number will be. This sounds obvious, but it could mean a very high false positive percentage if true prevalence is low.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ryaneshea From  https://t.co/42z7vRPB9c  https://t.co/XTSukcc3Tl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dana_e_morgan Sure is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would be great to hear from people who know a lot about the PCR testing industry. What‚Äôs the approximate false positive rate, all things considered, for cov2 PCR tests?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClareCraigPath Interesting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@john_beans @DirtyTesla Interesting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is the general population (no knowledge of symptoms) accuracy of a sars-cov2 PCR test &amp; is it possible to generate a false positive if you simply run enough cycles?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PPathole @cleantechnica A good PCR test should identify if I have the cov2 spike proteins, although I have heard some low accuracy numbers for those too. Hard to get a straight answer.   False positives will roughly scale with # of tests &amp; daily test rate has gone ballistic:  https://t.co/Pv6s71jZQo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justpaulinelol @cleantechnica Mild sniffles &amp; cough &amp; slight fever past few days. Right now, no symptoms, although I did take NyQuil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cleantechnica Technically, I tested positive, then negative twice, then positive again, so ‚ÄúElon Musk Tests Negative for Covid‚Äù is an equally correct title. The ‚Äúrapid antigen test‚Äù from BD seems to be about as useful as a flipping a coin.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KlotzAdam @NASASpaceflight @Erdayastronaut Understanding exactly how the body flaps control pitch, yaw &amp; roll during descent, such that the ship is positioned well to relight, flip &amp; land, would be a big win<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TesLatino Thanks to a great Autopilot/AI team working super hard!   Doing ‚Äúneural nets‚Äù without testing them against reality has led some groups to overestimate what they‚Äôre doing. Reality is the hardest sim.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut Raptor has now run for 90 secs at 300 bar chamber pressure before encountering issues. 210 mT-F sea level operating thrust seems achievable with no major changes.

<|startoftext|>@flcnhvy Good grief! SpaceX is getting zero money for this. Starship is designed to carry people &amp; cargo around Earth (also to moon &amp; Mars). Vast majority of use will be civilian. It‚Äôs just like an airline in space. All airlines sometimes carry military cargo, but ~99% is civilian.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Teslarati With FSD, we got stuck in a lot of local maximums, which wasn‚Äôt clear until we hit the ceiling. This time, it‚Äôs right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RationalEtienne @28delayslater Thank you, much more accurate haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@28delayslater This graph appears to be upside down<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Teslarati Sheer magnitude of the entire production system is hard to appreciate. Almost every element of production is &gt;75% automated. Only wire harnesses &amp; general assembly, which are &lt;10% of production costs, are primarily manual.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeslaClubIN @cleantechnica Will release order configurator probably in Jan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cleantechnica Limited FSD beta releasing on Tuesday next week, as promised. This will, at first, be limited to a small number of people who are expert &amp; careful drivers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shortword @jwangARK The SoC‚Äôs sync with each other 20 to 30 times/sec, exchanging output of NNs that should be in harmony, like a symphony, so it‚Äôs fairly obvious when one is discordant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jwangARK Tesla FSD computer‚Äôs dual SoCs function like twin engines on planes ‚Äî they each run different neural nets, so we do get full use of 144 TOPS, but there are enough nets running on each to allow the car to drive to safety if one SoC (or engine in this analogy) fails.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jwangARK Accurate analysis. Quite a few  ego/intelligence&gt;&gt;1 people in your comment thread haha. Neither MobilEye nor Nvidia, which are certainly good companies, could meet any of our capability, schedule, cost or power requirements.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @MariaBartiromo @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @JeffBezos @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness Yeah, there are literally &gt;1000% more cameras than 10 years ago, but still zero clear photos<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@electricfuture5 We face a tough dichotomy of applying resources to the old architecture or applying them to the new. It‚Äôs not a question of money. If there was a ‚Äúgreat engineer‚Äù factory, we would place a large order! Unfortunately, great engineers are very rare. This is solved in the FSD build.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flcnhvy Definitely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@enn_nafnlaus Exactly. He plays the ‚Äúpoor inventor‚Äù card, but was rich all along &amp; invented nothing (as far as I know). I went down to zero cash or sellable assets in 2008/2009, had no house &amp; had to borrow money from friends to pay rent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@enn_nafnlaus There are sketchy edits to Tesla wiki that whitewash Eberhard‚Äôs problems/glorify his role. Pretty odd. I was interim CEO/co-CEO from July 2007. Michael Marks was co-CEO for ~Q4 2007 &amp; Ze‚Äôev Drori for Q1 to ~Q3 2008. After Q3 2008 financing round bust, no choice but to be CEO.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@enn_nafnlaus When Eberhard was fired from the Tesla CEO role in mid 2007 for providing false information to me &amp; the board, no one left with him. That says it all.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@flcnhvy @Neopork85 @Caspar_Stanley @ErcXspace @MarcusHouseGame @FelixSchlang @C_Bass3d @nickhenning3d @SpaceX It might be used in some areas. ITAR laws prevent us from being too specific about solutions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Neopork85 @Caspar_Stanley @ErcXspace @MarcusHouseGame @FelixSchlang @C_Bass3d @nickhenning3d @SpaceX Tiles will be on hot side of flaps too. A very tough problem is sealing the moving flap to body joint without melting or shredding the seal.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TashaARK Additive manufacturing of parts is still far too costly for cars, but can rapidly create tooling to accelerate pace of innovation.

<|startoftext|>@RenataKonkoly @franktinsley @ankitXupta @TashaARK Pretty much, but I think it may end on a high note<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tesladri @ChananBos @raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog The crash absorption rails can be cut off &amp; replaced with a bolted part for collision repair<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ICannot_Enough @WholeMarsBlog Sandy Munro understands engineering<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flcnhvy @teslaownersSV @raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog That would be like licensing Battlestar Galactica. Actually building continuously evolving gargantuan factories is the hard part. Lots of people who worked at Tesla Gigafactories now work at competitors, but none of those companies have made one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@teslaownersSV @raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog Yes, the Gigafactory is the hardest &amp; most critical product<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChananBos @raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog Battery pack will be a bonded structure with cells providing shear transfer between steel upper &amp; lower face sheets, eliminating most of the center body parts while providing better torsional rigidity &amp; improved polar moment or inertia. This is a *major* breakthrough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog But now we understand production much better. It will be our primary competitive advantage long-term.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog Even GM &amp; Chrysler went bankrupt in 2009. Ford and Tesla are the only US car companies that have avoided bankruptcy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog The Model 3 production ramp was sheer agony for two years, but that was do or die for Tesla. No US car company has reached high volume production with sustained free cash flow in ~100 years. Hundreds of car startups all died or were absorbed for peanuts by big three.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvaFoxU @WholeMarsBlog Bringing a new product to volume production is 1% inspiration &amp; 99% perspiration. You do still need that critical seed of inspiration, but it‚Äôs fun &amp; takes ~100 people. Production takes &gt;10,000 people &amp; hurts like hell until the gigantic cybernetic collective runs smoothly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skorusARK Marginal cost of Starship mass to orbit should be well under $100/kg. Fully burdened cost depends on flight rate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WholeMarsBlog Prototypes are a piece of cake, but high volume production of a new technology is extremely hard. Takes much longer than people think to climb the production S-curve. I can‚Äôt emphasize enough that production is by *far* the hard part.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WholeMarsBlog We do expect to make heavy use of LFP for medium range cars &amp; stationary storage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WholeMarsBlog Berlin will use 4680 cell with structural battery pack &amp; front &amp; rear single piece castings. Also, a new paint system.   Lot of new technology will happen in Berlin, which means significant production risk. Fremont &amp; Shanghai will transition in ~2 years when new tech is proven.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@klod_ua @Erdayastronaut @TrevorMahlmann @johnkrausphotos @Mike_Seeley Cryo pressure test succeeded, but a small leak opened up near the engine mounts, possibly due to differential shrinking<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SpaceX Once these satellites reach their target position, we will be able to roll out a fairly wide public beta in northern US &amp; hopefully southern Canada. Other countries to follow as soon as we receive regulatory approval.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flcnhvy @alvianchoiri We‚Äôre not seeing notable differences yet. I think the boosters could probably do 100+ reflights. Some of the (small) composite helium tanks would need to be replaced. Maybe turbopump hot sections.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PPathole @alvianchoiri Roughly a week or two turnaround is all that‚Äôs needed to meet max launch demand. Starship Super Heavy is designed for reflight in less than an hour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alvianchoiri Ahem, yes, it was the 3rd flight of this booster &amp; 3rd flight for active half of fairing. Aiming for 10+ flights of booster &amp; fairing by end of next year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4th flight &amp; landing for this booster<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>5 minutes from launch. Looks good so far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cleantechnica So crazy to subsidize pollution! This is not good for people, especially in dense cities with heavy traffic, where your air intake is jammed up against another car‚Äôs exhaust pipe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SciGuySpace It‚Äôs a step in the right direction, but they should really aim for full reusability by 2026. Larger rocket would also make sense for literal economies of scale. Goal should be to minimize cost per useful ton to orbit or it will at best serve a niche market.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thesheetztweetz @waEMD @SpaceX @SpaceXStarlink @WANationalGuard Starlink will be a revolution in connectivity, especially for remote regions or for emergency services when landlines are damaged<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WholeMarsBlog @MKBHD Yeah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdlanBogatyryov @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal @TheFavoritist Great letter! It will be increasingly difficult to see Starlink satellites, as we‚Äôre actively working with the astronomer community to ensure that even the most sensitive telescopes are fine &amp; scientific progress is not impeded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal @TheFavoritist The ship rings are thicker than they need to be (for now), so same thickness works for booster &amp; ship for hoop stress. Booster lower tank will have longitudinal stiffeners to prevent buckling.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ID_AA_Carmack Completely agree<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut Yes, the flaps are now directly driven by electric motors with a gearbox! No more hydraulics.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@flcnhvy @NASASpaceflight @austinbarnard45 @PPathole Mostly 304L, some 301. Broke at 301 to 304 interface. SN9 will be all 304. Also, we‚Äôre making some tweaks to the 304 alloy mixture.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NASASpaceflight @austinbarnard45 @PPathole 8 bar differential in ullage, 9 bar at base due to propellant head. It‚Äôs enough. Improvements in work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PPathole We just need enough height to test body flaps &amp; drawing propellant from headers vs main tanks. Will do several flights to confirm working well, then add heat shield &amp; go high Mach.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tobyliiiiiiiiii @CARandDRIVER @Tesla Haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The extreme difficulty of scaling production of new technology is not well understood. It‚Äôs 1000% to 10,000% harder than making a few prototypes. The machine that makes the machine is vastly harder than the machine itself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NASASpaceflight @BocaChicaGal Haha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We intend to increase, not reduce battery cell purchases from Panasonic, LG &amp; CATL (possibly other partners too). However, even with our cell suppliers going at maximum speed, we still foresee significant shortages in 2022 &amp; beyond unless we also take action ourselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Important note about Tesla Battery Day unveil tomorrow. This affects long-term production, especially Semi, Cybertruck &amp; Roadster, but what we announce will not reach serious high-volume production until 2022.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvaFoxU Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Neopork85 @SpaceX @MarcusHouseGame We really need better legs for Starship. They‚Äôre coming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Neopork85 @SpaceX @MarcusHouseGame Most likely, all flaps will fold after landing to reduce wind tip over force. There may be some cases where flaps deployed help stability (change in wind direction), in which case one or more flaps will extend.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@soumiksf @ID_AA_Carmack Yeah, we will open Dojo for training as a web service once we work out the bugs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samiralyateem @ID_AA_Carmack There are a lot of pointless zeroes in FP32 neural nets. You can chop off 16 of the 32 bits without losing meaningful precision. This works well with neural nets, but not with regular computing, which expects extreme precision.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soumiksf @ID_AA_Carmack Dojo uses our own chips &amp; a computer architecture optimized for neural net training, not a GPU cluster. Could be wrong, but I think it will be best in world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@llamaa35079089 @ID_AA_Carmack @Tesla You really want waypoints this much?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ID_AA_Carmack For Dojo, we‚Äôre betting on FP16 with floating floating point (essentially, truncating mostly zeroes), so it feels like FP32 &amp; existing software just works. We considered FP8 for a while, but everyone hated it. I even asked Twitter! For inference, int8 works great.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kimbal We‚Äôre seeing field false positives much higher than lab false positives, in range of 5% to 10%.

<|startoftext|>@SamTalksTesla @tlowdon @daniellevitt22 In principle, I think synthetic RNA (and DNA) has amazing potential. This basically makes the solution to many diseases a software problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tlowdon @daniellevitt22 As you‚Äôd expect, this has resulted in a proportionately very high number of C19 false positives. Field test reliability we are seeing is best case 5%, worst case 50% false positive. Much worse than lab accuracy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kimbal There are a lot of C19 false positives messing up the numbers. Even tests with 5% false positive rate (in *field*, not lab) would show up as ~17 million  fake C19 cases even if there were actually none.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@geekwire There are a ridiculous number of false positive C19 tests, in some cases ~50%. False positives scale linearly with # of tests. This is a big part of why C19 positive tests are going up while hospitalizations &amp; mortality are declining. Anyone who tests positive should retest.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@flcnhvy There will be many test flights before commercial passengers are carried. First Earth to Earth test flights might be in 2 or 3 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @russ_parrish We need to be far enough away so as not to bother heavily populated areas. The launch &amp; landing are not subtle. But you could get within a few miles of the spaceport in a boat.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@VitalVegas Looking likely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mad_Maelstrom @Peter_J_Beck @torybruno @Starlinksat223 @Erdayastronaut Throttling is done by adjusting flow to the ox and fuel preburners. The lower limit of thrust is ox &amp; fuel turbopump injector preburner ‚Äústiffness‚Äù, essentially when do the preburner elements start flaming out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SciGuySpace Tank didn‚Äôt burst, but leaked at 7.6 bar. This is a good result &amp; supports idea of 304L stainless being better than 301. We‚Äôre developing our own alloy to take this even further. Leak before burst is highly desirable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peter_J_Beck @torybruno @Starlinksat223 @Erdayastronaut Yeah. Merlin, using a single pintle injector with cold, liquid propellant, needs a longer chamber than Raptor, which uses a large number of coaxial injectors, despite Merlin being less than half thrust. Propellant enters Raptor chamber as hot gas that‚Äôs already mixed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tobyliiiiiiiiii @SciGuySpace Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SciGuySpace That‚Äôs the goal. There a few known weak points on this test tank, probably capable of more pressure. The second test tank to follow shortly has addressed the weak points.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @i_gvf @SciGuySpace Exactly. Chartering a dedicated 747 flight around the world costs less than buying a small, single engine turboprop plane.

<|startoftext|>@nickwijngaards @Erdayastronaut @SciGuySpace Hundreds of improvements in manufacturability primarily (this is by far the hardest problem), mass down, thrust up, Isp up. Current improvement list continues past SN50. As the saying goes, it‚Äôs 1% inspiration &amp; 99% perspiration ‚Ä¶<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@John_Gardi @SciGuySpace Also, insulation of a deep cryogen( which I‚Äôd call anything that liquifies nitrogen aka 78% of air) is heavy &amp; prone to heat leaks. H2 is hell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tesla factory workplace safety is 5% better than industry average for manufacturers &amp; improving fast  https://t.co/axmInA9fZb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @SciGuySpace Important technical note: due to higher O/F of CH4 vs RP1 (oxygen is dense) &amp; significant density increase of subcooled CH4 (plus no common dome insulation needed), plus cryo strength bump of CH4, tank mass of CH4/O2 stage is almost same as RP1/O2.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @SciGuySpace We could never reach 380 Isp with RP/kerosene. CH4 has higher Isp potential on paper, but even better in practice. With CH4, you can reach &gt;99% of max theoretical combustion efficiency, but RP is ~97% on a good day &amp; requires desooting of turbines between flights.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@venus47203379 @engineers_feed Haha. Will post summary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SciGuySpace Combined with SpaceX deep subcooling of propellants to near liquefaction temp of N2, use of common dome (CH4 &amp; O2 liquid at similar temps) &amp; higher T/W of engines enables de facto higher delta-V than an H2/O2 stage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SciGuySpace Quite a piece! I should credit Soviet/Russian engine work in the 80‚Äôs as being a factor in deciding to switch from H2 to CH4. They demonstrated excellent performance on test stands, with Isp up to 380 secs.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut Absolutely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimBridenstine @Commercial_Crew @NASA Outcome-based contracting with multiple competitors is vastly better than cost-plus (especially if sole-sourced), as the former rewards results &amp; latter rewards waste.

<|startoftext|>@KristiRJensen @EverydayElon @SjvTesla @GerberKawasaki @thirdrowtesla Exactly! Tesla knows far more about what needs to be done to be safe through our Tesla China factory experience than an (unelected) interim junior official in Alameda County.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EverydayElon @SjvTesla @GerberKawasaki @thirdrowtesla Absolutely, please do! You should be allowed to recoup damages from the county.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SjvTesla @GerberKawasaki @thirdrowtesla San Joaquin County, right next door to Alameda, has been sensible &amp; reasonable, whereas Alameda has been irrational &amp; detached from reality. Our castings foundry and other faculties in San Joaquin have been working 24/7 this entire time with no ill effects. Same with Giga Nevada.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GerberKawasaki @thirdrowtesla Frankly, this is the final straw. Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately. If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependen on how Tesla is treated in the future. Tesla is the last carmaker left in CA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GerberKawasaki @thirdrowtesla Tesla is filing a lawsuit against Alameda County immediately. The unelected &amp; ignorant ‚ÄúInterim Health Officer‚Äù of Alameda is acting contrary to the Governor, the President, our Constitutional freedoms &amp; just plain common sense!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kulpability @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @ValkyrieBaron11 @NASASpaceflight No, but it‚Äôs mostly the same as the ship, except for the thrust bulkhead (31 engines vs 6)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sspencer_smb @flcnhvy It‚Äôs not all about engineering, although that is my personal favorite. Striving to make products or provide services in excess of what you consume is the noble goal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flcnhvy To be clear, I do think finance &amp; law are important, but too many smart people in the US go into those fields. Also, too many MBAs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@raytech247 @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @ValkyrieBaron11 @NASASpaceflight Yes, mostly because you can use the ship every week going to the moon instead of every two years for Mars (best case)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @ValkyrieBaron11 @NASASpaceflight Would be about 10 times that cost for payload to surface of Mars<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @ValkyrieBaron11 @NASASpaceflight Starship + Super Heavy propellant mass is 4800 tons (78% O2 &amp; 22% CH4). I think we can get propellant cost down to ~$100/ton in volume, so ~$500k/flight. With high flight rate, probably below $1.5M fully burdened cost for 150 tons to orbit or ~$10/kg.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @ValkyrieBaron11 @flcnhvy @NASASpaceflight A fully &amp; rapidly reusable orbital rocket is fundamental to extending life beyond Earth.

<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Fundamentally, Atlas is still dependent on Russia to launch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Yeah, Atlas main engine is Russian. Great engine, but not US. Also, their fairing is Swiss. I think interstage &amp; payload separation system also not US.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robotbeat @ghotiing @CruizVinicius @josh119872 @SweetINXS @voteLabonte @Erdayastronaut @Tesla Tesla actually sent out ResMed, Philips &amp; Medtronic units.

<|startoftext|>@davidmholtom @Nu23ro @SciGuySpace Exactly. In mid 2009, Tesla received non-binding approval for loan program actually signed into law by Bush in late 2008.

<|startoftext|>@thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Last I checked, over a million dollars less. Moreover, F9 is launching far more often &amp; is only rocket fully NASA-approved for launching astronauts, so that gap is increasing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SciGuySpace @Some1gee Also, it costs less $ to insure a Falcon 9 mission. That‚Äôs the acid test.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SciGuySpace True. Only reason other medium &amp; heavy lift rocket companies are winning any missions at all is due to govt intervention. Otherwise, they‚Äôd be as defunct as expendable airplane companies. ULA is powered by lobbying.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @PPathole @austinbarnard45 @LabPadre Rockets &amp; spacecraft have to operate in vacuum, so maintaining pressure is fundamental. However, this can be made very safe over time imo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @PPathole @austinbarnard45 @LabPadre There are redundant pressure control valves. It‚Äôs a new system and SN3 was simply commanded wrong. Rockets are hard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @PPathole @austinbarnard45 @LabPadre If you lose pressure control on rocket propellant tanks, you‚Äôre doomed anyway, so might as well go all in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We‚Äôre adding this here catchy tune to the music maker in the Tesla!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PPathole @austinbarnard45 @LabPadre Pretty much. Good news is that this was a test configuration error, rather than a design or build mistake. Not enough pressure in the LOX tank ullage to maintain stability with a heavy load in the CH4 tank. This was done with N2.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@flcnhvy @28delayslater @thirdrowtesla Yeah, very important to provide C/BiPAP devices to *prevent* cases from becoming severe. Once severe (intratracheal intubation), survival rates are low.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@28delayslater @thirdrowtesla Invasive ventilators are for worst case patients. Survival rate at that point is low, as Gov Cuomo has pointed out. Nonetheless, we start delivery of intratracheal Medtronic units in NYC tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@28delayslater @thirdrowtesla Exactly. Moreover, all hospitals were given exact specifications of Resmed &amp; Philips ventilators before delivery &amp; all confirmed they would be critical.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kshah07 @yosefontwo @JSellMafia @NYCMayor Yes. Just as with groceries, the panic is also causing hoarding of ventilators, preventing them from reaching the hospitals where they are needed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NYCMayor Biggest value Tesla is providing is precise delivery of ventilators exactly to the ICU where &amp; when they‚Äôre needed. There are many ventilators in warehouses, but stuck in logistics/routing/paperwork issues.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SteveHamel16 @JordanWells33 @hereforthecom19 @ScottWapnerCNBC Thanks Tesla China team, China Customs Authority &amp; LAX customs for acting so swiftly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveHamel16 @JordanWells33 @hereforthecom19 @ScottWapnerCNBC Yup, China had an oversupply, so we bought 1255 FDA-approved ResMed, Philips &amp; Medtronic ventilators on Friday night &amp; airshipped them to LA. If you want a free ventilator installed, please let us know!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kristennetten @thirdrowtesla Yeah, pretty much. House could talk to car &amp; know when you‚Äôre expected home, so temp &amp; humidity would be perfect just as you arrive. No wasted energy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@romn8tr @stephenpallotta @ajtourville @Teslarati This is a way bigger deal than most people realize<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stephenpallotta @ajtourville @Teslarati Sure would love to do home hvac that‚Äôs quiet &amp; efficient, with humidity control &amp; HEPA filter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stephenpallotta @ajtourville @Teslarati Yes. PCB design techniques applied to create a heat exchanger that is physically impossible by normal means. Heat pump also has a local heating loop to spool up fast &amp; extend usable temperature range. Octavalve is pretty special too. Team did great work. No credit to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ajtourville @Teslarati The heat pump and rear body castings are a step beyond<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@teslaownersSV @RenataKonkoly @sdunbabin @jonkay @Quillette Most likely, imo, we will see a significant reduction in the confirmed C19 case growth rate this week. Follow chart at bottom of this CDC page:  https://t.co/vZ3PbhQihG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RenataKonkoly @sdunbabin @jonkay @Quillette Exactly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonkay @Quillette According to the Italian govt, only 12% of deaths are actually due to C19. This is a significant policy difference in Italy vs most other countries.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thirdrowtesla Yup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnnaCrider1 @thirdrowtesla We‚Äôll try to get &amp; deliver as many as possible. N95 masks are a pain to wear btw. Less onerous masks are better most of the time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kristennetten @thirdrowtesla @SalehCU Yeah. We have a mask shipment stuck at LAX. Hopefully freed up soon.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CDCgov Close contact family gatherings that mix young kids, who have almost no risk of C19 death, with grandparents who have high risk (especially those with prior lung damage), are one of the most powerful mortality vectors<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jennerator211 We have N95 masks &amp; getting PAPRs. Will have our team reach out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just had a long engineering discussion with Medtronic about state-of-the-art ventilators. Very impressive team!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamTalksTesla @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @NateSilver538 No problem :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamTalksTesla @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @NateSilver538 Sigmoid (S-curve) is how all physical and mental viruses behave, regardless of containment. Containment reduces asymptote of S-curve. At this point, we have strict containment in US/Europe &amp; should expect similarly reduced asymptote to China.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @NateSilver538 Sigmoidal for China, followed by sigmoidal for rest of world<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lauren62515251 @PPathole @NateSilver538 Fair point :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RiccitelliDylan @ColdBuschLights @PPathole @NateSilver538 Exactly, both would be false positive. Also, dying with C19 is different from dying because of C19. Vast majority who died had other illnesses too.  https://t.co/YKMW54q2kL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PPathole @NateSilver538 Up to 80% false positive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PPathole @NateSilver538 Sure, although ventilator companies definitely know how to make ventilators. Just a spike in demand right now. Also, using CPAP machines for less severe cases &amp; using one ventilator for several patients seem like good moves to meet short-term demand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NateSilver538 Do you have data on the false positive rate? I‚Äôve heard a wide range of numbers. CDC numbers are almost an order of magnitude lower between high fidelity data (onset date known) and ‚Äúpresumed positive‚Äù.  https://t.co/vZ3PbhQihG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NateSilver538 Important consideration<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@friedberg Feels like the plot of Deus Ex  https://t.co/R8tmw048JM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MG42bonesaw A single computer, pump &amp; pressure accumulator would be fine for many patients, but ideally individual valves per patient to personalize care &amp; avoid cross-flow risk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RenataKonkoly @moskov Yeah, SpaceX is working on ventilators too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@moskov That won‚Äôt work for our auto parts suppliers, so, no, our US factory can‚Äôt stay open<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdLudlow Yes, we‚Äôre working on ventilators, even though I think they probably won‚Äôt be needed<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DOfaquarius @PPathole We‚Äôre working on ventilators, even though I think there will not be a shortage by the time we can make enough to matter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flcnhvy Anyone feeling even slightly ill should stay home. Elderly should avoid close contact, even with family members, for now. Those seem most important.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RationalEtienne @PPathole  https://t.co/eltgA3hrAr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RationalEtienne @PPathole Kids are essentially immune, but elderly with existing conditions are vulnerable. Family gatherings with close contact between kids &amp; grandparents probably most risky.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PPathole Based on current trends, probably close to zero new cases in US too by end of April<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PPathole Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No new domestic corona cases in China  https://t.co/lGmxRvMyFy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@westcoastbill Imo, this professor is correct. Also, growth rate of confirmed C19 cases is dropping every day, despite 10X increase in testing. From Tues to today, was 43%, 24%, 17%. Track this chart:  https://t.co/vZ3PbhQihG<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@M_Mosseri @SpaceX @NASA @NASA_Astronauts Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DisruptResearch @Jason True<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jason Exactly. My guess is that the panic will cause more harm than the virus, if that hasn‚Äôt happened already.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NateSilver538 Tesla makes cars with sophisticated hvac systems. SpaceX makes spacecraft with life support systems. Ventilators are not difficult, but cannot be produced instantly. Which hospitals have these shortages you speak of right now?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@flcnhvy @SciGuySpace F9 iteration slowed down as payloads became too important to risk. Little change is expected going forward with F9/FH or Dragon. Starship production &amp; thus iterative improvement will be much faster than Falcon. Driving hard for fully reusable orbital flight this year!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PPathole @JohnHanzl It‚Äôs mostly to balance the ship during entry. After delivering satellites, the front is light &amp; back is heavy due to engines &amp; landing legs.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SciGuySpace These problems are fundamentally intertwined. Building many rockets allows for successive approximation. Progress in any given technology is simply # of iterations * progress between iterations.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tobyliiiiiiiiii @Erdayastronaut There will be a common area in the forward section with a big window like this. It will be a lot heavier than steel, but not dangerous. Consider astronauts on the moon with a very thin windowed helmet. They were fine.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Teslarati @13ericralph31 Unmodified water tower machines do not work well for orbital rockets, as mass efficiency is critical for the latter, but not the former. Hopper, for example, was made of 12.5mm steel vs 4mm for SN1 orbital design. Optimized skins will be &lt;2mm in places across a 9000mm diameter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nextspaceflight @chraveesh @Teslarati No, they‚Äôre SN1. SN2 to follow shortly. Aiming to be a little better each time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chraveesh @Teslarati Yes, we‚Äôre tuning weld parameters to reduce puckering &amp; building a heavy duty planisher to flatten &amp; cold work the weld area<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Teslarati That said, although substantial capital &amp; engineering is required to achieve extreme precision, marginal production cost of the primary structure should actually be *less* than a water tower, because it‚Äôs built inside a factory in volume.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Teslarati This isn‚Äôt quite correct. An orbital rocket needs precision that‚Äôs 3X to 4X better than a water tower, so super precise parts, fixtures &amp; welding are needed. Suborbital is much more forgiving.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CathieDWood @sbarnettARK @jwangARK @ARKInvest First, we need to make it super safe &amp; easy to use, then determine greatest utility vs risk.

As with vehicle safety, it will be much harder to pass our internal standards than minimum regulatory standards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flcnhvy @Tesla @thirdrowtesla Ok sure üòÄ Btw, we recruit great engineers from almost anywhere in the world, so this shouldn‚Äôt be thought of as USA only.

<|startoftext|>@indiealexh @mojosusan @BLKMDL3 @TeslaGong @ElonsBrain @CathieDWood @ARKInvest True, it has general applications beyond fast, high precision micro-electrode insertion that automatically avoids the vasculature<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeslaGong @ElonsBrain @CathieDWood @ARKInvest It will ultimately be used to make up for entire lost sections of the brain due to stroke/accident/congenital.

<|startoftext|>@PPathole PyTorch is the most frequently used external tool set/library<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our NN is initially in Python for rapid iteration, then converted to C++/C/raw metal driver code for speed (important!). Also, tons of C++/C engineers needed for vehicle control &amp; entire rest of car. Educational background is irrelevant, but all must pass hardcore coding test.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CathieDWood @ARKInvest The profound impact of high bandwidth, high precision neural interfaces is underappreciated. Neuralink may have this in a human as soon as this year.

<|startoftext|>@ErlendMoberget @ramez @KHayhoe Very true. What‚Äôs really mindblowing is how much energy the sun outputs &amp; how little of it is absorbed by Earth. There is sooo much solar energy.

<|startoftext|>@RQuiddich Every tank under pressure is a balloon tank ‚Äî it‚Äôs just question of degree. Starship tanks are not balloon tanks like Atlas in sense that they don‚Äôt collapse when depressurized on the ground.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight Everything is compressible, but liquid compression at these pressures is not significant. However, the tanks do expand under pressure, creating a bit more volume. Keeping propellant super cold has a big effect on density of ~10% in case of CH4.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight A given tank pressure is needed to feed the engine turbopumps &amp; pressure-stabilize/relieve compression load on the cylinder walls<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight Dome to barrel weld made it to 7.1 bar, which is pretty good as ~6 bar is needed for orbital flight.

<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut Spin start from COPVs so the ox &amp; fuel turbines spool up super fast in unison. A precise start with full flow staged combustion is very important.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SmileSimplify @Erdayastronaut Moving to an enclosed (fairly) clean room environment for SN2 in Jan, although, unlike aluminum, stainless steel welding is not super sensitive. Our main issue here in Boca is that it can get very windy, which affects weld arc &amp; steel melt pool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut No, will be autogenous from the start, tapping hot CH4 &amp; O2 from Raptor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@teslaownersSV @TonyCrisostomo @Erdayastronaut Yeah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut Best would probably be an autogenous laser weld, but we need more precise parts &amp; fixtures. Hopefully get that done in 2020.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut Almost everything is different. These parts are stamped vs manually bump-formed &amp; TIP TIG welded vs flux core. Higher precision, stronger joints &amp; 20% mass reduction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DJSnM We use that process for the Raptor nozzle jacket. The knuckles of this dome are stamped in Michigan with a 4000 ton car body press, which costs much less for same outcome.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Everman @Teslarati @tesla_raj True, more for parking at destination. Really needs to fit in same external envelope as a full-size SUV, but with better height control with air suspension, so it can fit in low clearance parking garages.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Teslarati @tesla_raj We can prob reduce width by an inch &amp; maybe reduce length by 6+ inches without losing on utility or esthetics. Min height is below 75 inches when air suspension set to low. Will post exact number soon.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@stephenjudkins @flcnhvy Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy Deleting throttle allows the engine to achieve max thrust on max thrust variant. Other variants will have throttle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy SpaceX engine production is gearing up to build about a Raptor a day by next year, so up to 365 engines per year. Most will be the (as high as) 300 ton thrust (but no throttle &amp; no gimbal) variant for Super Heavy. Cumulative thrust/year could thus be as high as 100,000 tons/year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy Raptor is evolving rapidly. Probably wouldn‚Äôt consider it to be even V1.0 until roughly engine 50, although probably engines 12+ can be retrofitted for orbital flight, especially on Super Heavy, which is less sensitive to engine variation. It just needs crazy up force!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jchybow @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy Pretty much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leo_cadle @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy Exactly! It‚Äôs also a far more exciting &amp; inspiring future if consciousness is out there among the stars, than forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event, however far in the future that may be (hopefully, very far).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy No, in the beginning, assuming you even make it there alive, Mars will be far more dangerous &amp; difficult than Earth &amp; take decades of hard labor to make self-sufficient. That‚Äôs the sales pitch. Want to go?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy So it will take about 20 years to transfer a million tons to Mars Base Alpha, which is hopefully enough to make it sustainable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy As the planets align only once every two years<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy A thousand ships will be needed to create a sustainable Mars city<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Malcolmmarsman @flcnhvy No problem. We could program Starship to perform Swan Lake in the sky. Minimizing landing burn propellant mass is what‚Äôs hard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flcnhvy Current global payload to orbit capacity is about 500 tons per year, of which Falcon is about half<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flcnhvy If we build as many Starships as Falcons, so ~100 vehicles &amp; each does 100 tons to orbit, that‚Äôs a capacity of 10 million tons of payload to orbit per year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flcnhvy Payload to orbit per year of Starship fleet is most mind-blowing metric, as it‚Äôs designed to fly 3X per day, which is ~1000X per year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flcnhvy The economics have to be something like that to build a self-sustaining city on Mars<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bob_burrough Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rafaelcr @OfWudan Would be odd to expect anything else<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TJ_Cooney That said, most Starship spaceports will probably need to be ~20 miles / 30km offshore for acceptable noise levels, especially for frequent daily flights, as would occur for point to point flights on Earth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TJ_Cooney Wow, 2011 seems like eons ago! With fairing recovery, Falcon is ~80% reusable, but reflight takes several days &amp; requires boats. Starship will be fully reusable with booster reflight possible every few hours &amp; ship reflight every 8 hours. No boats needed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flcnhvy Great poem<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MartianDays @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @AerojetRdyne We def could be wrong about this, but it‚Äôs actually good to fix high efficiency vacuum engines with giant nozzles in place &amp; only thrust vector engines with smaller nozzles. Don‚Äôt need a lot of room &amp; moment of inertia is much lower.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Also, we‚Äôre keeping area ratio low enough to fire Raptor Vac at sea level without flow separation, so that‚Äôs leaving a lot on the table<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Couple months, but V1.0 of Raptor Vac is suboptimal, as optimized for speed of development. Isp maybe 365 to 370 sec.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Max thrust version of Raptor should achieve true T/W &gt; 170. Target is 1.5 ton engine with &gt;260 t-F. Max Isp version should achieve ~380 sec, but T/W probably &lt;120 due to big nozzle. These are just guesses for now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Oberth effect is not well appreciated. Value of high thrust low in gravity well is not captured in simple delta-v equation. One of the reasons we favor CH4 over H2.  https://t.co/LijrUMuJDq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@torybruno @Erdayastronaut @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne This is true. All that matters is number used in ‚àÜv equation. Propellant residuals are incredibly important, often overwhelming engine mass.  https://t.co/s2LcEapGAU<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@J_ump_er @neiltyson @Space_Station To be precise, r is distance from center of masses of two objects. Center of mass of Earth is ~6400km, so gravity change is small at Space Station altitude, which is ~6800km from center of Earth.  https://t.co/21hICWczMq<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wk057 @Tesla Should be much better at this point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Price for fully installed solar plus battery has been reduced ~10% to help those affected by blackouts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brockm Yes, but probably a year or two away. Lot of fish to fry ‚Ä¶<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bruce_mittleman Tesla cannot continue to lose money. To achieve our goal of environmental sustainability, Tesla must be financially sustainable or we will cease to exist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Allows homeowner potential to go completely off grid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>V important: pure solar subscription is guaranteed to be a net money-maker for the homeowner or Tesla will take the panels back. Adding Powerwall negatively affects economics, but gives homeowner power protection in event of a blackout.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cutza7 When the car is FSD without supervision, ie robotaxi, you‚Äôll be able to earn far more than monthly lease/loan cost by allowing others to use it. Managing a small fleet of robotaxis will be a career for many &amp; much better than driving a single car.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tesla_addicted @sanjeev_r11 @vincent13031925 Putting panels on east or west facing roofs works well too. Energy loss is fairly minor. Just north facing that‚Äôs problematic above ~30 deg latitude.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Carter__99 @Erdayastronaut @askingbubble385 @Cor_SPACE Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @Cor_SPACE Well, hopefully closer to 300 bar over time. However, that the chamber/nozzle jacket has so many joints &amp; dissimilar metals at such high pressure &amp; temperature is what I find remarkable about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @Cor_SPACE No, we‚Äôve been focusing on production (now on SN12). Only need 250 bar or even a bit less for Starship/Super Heavy. Anything above 250 is nice to have &amp; we‚Äôll get around to it, but not needed for flight.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OranMaliphant @Erdayastronaut Could do it, but we developed low cost reusable tiles that are much lighter than transpiration cooling &amp; quite robust<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut Better just to ride your max temp all the way down &amp; let T^4 be your friend. Lower atmosphere cools you down real fast, so not crazy hot after landing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DJSnM Exactly. For reusable heatshield, minimize peak heating. For ablative/expendable, minimize total heat. Therefore reusable like Starship wants lift during high Mach reentry for lower peak, but higher total heat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut It does actually generate lift in hypersonic regime, which is important to limit peak heating<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CptnCrutch5373 @Erdayastronaut @Kalzsom Approximately correct. We also fire the ACS thrusters to rotate the vehicle &amp; ignite Raptors at full gimbal angle to complete the turn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kalzsom @Erdayastronaut For aero control, it comes down to % of cross-sectional area moving vs not. Flexible as to whether front or rear, so long as within bounds of center of mass &amp; pressure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut Current analysis, which I‚Äôm not fully bought into, suggests that 2 rear fins with separate airframe-mounted legs will be lighter, so this is the plan for Mk1/Mk2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut Stability is controlled by (very) rapid movement of rear &amp; fwd fins during entry &amp; landing, as well as ACS thrusters. The smaller leeward ‚Äúfin‚Äù would simply be used as a leg.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ElonAccessories @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy @Teslarati Actually, Model 3 would beat the Taycan on N√ºrburgring over multiple laps, as it has more range<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GaryTheBot_ Wise words from Gary the Bot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>However, we won‚Äôt customize the contract or engage in negotiations. That just causes the Tesla &amp; customer legal bill to be high &amp; drag things out. Pay for clean power, not lawyers! It makes way more sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good analysis. You can order commercial solar in literally 30 secs if you use Apple Pay at  https://t.co/sCkn87vMa9.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeslaForLife @teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners Exactly! We‚Äôve only one car factory in California &amp; one Gigafactory (for batteries &amp; drive units) in Nevada. Giga Shanghai will do cars, batteries &amp; drive units for the greater China area. Over time, regional Gigafactories will lower costs &amp; improve logistics worldwide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners Should note that these product mix &amp; logistics errors also results in regional *undersupply*, eg UK &amp; Ireland right now, but we don‚Äôt raise the prices even so. The intent, at any given moment in time, is: heads we lose, tails buyers win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners That‚Äôs not to say that Tesla people somewhere in the world are being overzealous &amp; possibly overstepping our core principles, which is why I‚Äôm looking into it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners At end of quarter, there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly 40 global regions, due to planning mistakes &amp; logistics problems (Earth is a big place). Small changes in prices are needed to correct local supply/demand imbalances.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kristennetten @Model3Owners The fundamental operating principle is that prices, while they may change, will change for all equally &amp; should never be a function of bargaining. This is normal for most products, but weirdly not for the auto industry in most parts of the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flcnhvy @hoofhrtd1254 @Teslatunity @Model3Owners Agreed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hoofhrtd1254 @Teslatunity @Model3Owners Going to early access (including all who bought FSD) Tesla owners in US next week. If US early access rollout looks good, then rest of world early access owners following week. Might be some delays in EU for regulatory approval.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Teslatunity @Model3Owners There aren‚Äôt really meant to be ‚ÄúTesla incentives‚Äù, just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product, as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives. Overarching principle, however, is same deal for all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Model3Owners Looking into this. A fundamental premise of Tesla is that everyone is offered same terms at same time, ie what you get should never be a function of bargaining.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @JHC2718 @MagnussonMani @vicvic21266 @flcnhvy @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Failure rate is actually both higher &amp; lower than that, as the Falcon 9 design has changed almost completely several times.

<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Distance from fireball is 0.5*a*t^2, so if t is small, you haven‚Äôt moved far even if a is high. At ~6g thrust, you‚Äôll only travel ~0.03m in 100 ms. Pressure wave (aka explosion) with liquid rockets is low, as ox &amp; fuel are poorly mixed.

<|startoftext|>@DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Not currently planning for pad abort with early Starships, but maybe we should. Vac engines would be dual bell &amp; fixed (no gimbal), which means we can stabilize nozzle against hull.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@justpaulinelol Not risky imo &amp; can be adjusted/improved real-time. Essentially need to figure out most effective way to convert mass to energy, as Mars is slightly too far from this solar system‚Äôs fusion reactor (the sun).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wingod @DJSnM @ThePhoenixFlare True, diverting a comet would be super hard. Could be done with small asteroids &amp; a mass driver, but this is risky.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nuke Mars refers to a continuous stream of very low fallout nuclear fusion explosions above the atmosphere to create artificial suns. Much like our sun, this would not cause Mars to become radioactive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaneidyEve Will probably make sense to do this when Starship Mk 1 has 3 Raptors, moving body fins &amp; landing gear installed, which is hopefully mid September<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryStoltz1 @ThePhoenixFlare Will be converted to Raptor vertical test stand<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThePhoenixFlare Trickier than it may seem on Mars, as atmospheric density is 1% that of Earth &amp; gravity is 38%, but doable for localized warming<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@schristakos @jgrano305 @DMC_Ryan Hoping to get ‚ÄúJoe Mode‚Äù into V10. The default, of course, is normal volume, but selecting ‚ÄúJoe Mode‚Äù would lower the volume of strident beeps &amp; chimes by half.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TesLatino Maybe August, not more than a few months<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ktoddstorch Yeah, feels just like an old school drive in movie experience, but with much better sound<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When full self-driving is approved by regulators, we will enable video while moving<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @goathobbit High reflectivity minimizes photonic heating, high emissivity minimizes particle heating. No need to radiate heat away if you aren‚Äôt hot in the first place. Also, as metal heats up to yellow/red/white, it stops being reflective.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SnazzyQ @PhenomenalPoto @aaronjleonard @tailosivetech Straw man fallacy. To appreciate, your car just needs to be worth more than you paid for it, so probably ~$75k is enough if you bought a 3. FSD will be bundled in all cars (important point).

<|startoftext|>@flcnhvy @SnazzyQ @PhenomenalPoto @aaronjleonard @tailosivetech No, since Tesla will charge a % fee for being in our robotaxi fleet, but it will rise to whatever the clearing price is, otherwise all our cars will be bought by scalpers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SnazzyQ @PhenomenalPoto @aaronjleonard @tailosivetech If we make all cars with FSD package self-driving, as planned, any such Tesla should be worth $100k to $200k, as utility increases from ~12 hours/week to ~60 hours/week<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NebraskaJR @Ninja FWIW, based on calcs I did 10 years ago, cross-over point for Li-ion beating kerosene is ~400 Wh/kg. High cycle batteries are just over 300 Wh/kg today, but probably exceed 400 in ~5 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NebraskaJR @Ninja Jet A (kerosene) has much higher energy density than Li-ion, but electric motors weigh much less &amp; convert stored energy to motion better than combustion engines<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ninja Yes, but still a bit too limited on range. That will change in coming years as battery energy density improves.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SpaceXFan97 @lister6520 @justpaulinelol @MattLBates @Erdayastronaut Almost anything. Length/diameter is much lower &amp; Starship doesn‚Äôt have a hammerhead fairing that acts like main sail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lister6520 @justpaulinelol @MattLBates @Erdayastronaut You‚Äôre touching on a good critique of Falcon 9. Our 1st stage to 2nd stage propellant ratio is too high. We‚Äôre fixing that with Starship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@baconmashwbs @Canis_Majoris_6 @YusifzadaAgshin That would be unwise. Probably needs a restraint mechanism like Disney‚Äôs Space Mountain roller coaster. Would feel similar to Space Mountain in a lot of ways, but you‚Äôd exit on another continent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Canis_Majoris_6 @YusifzadaAgshin ~1000, as all seats would be ‚Äúcoach‚Äù &amp; no toilets, pilot area or food galley needed. Most flights would only be 15 to 20 mins. It‚Äôs basically an ICBM traveling at Mach 25 that lands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YusifzadaAgshin About 100, assuming people want cabins. Pressurized volume is similar to A380. Could take a lot more on shorter trips.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @SciGuySpace That was our design approach in early days, but fairing mass is much higher &amp; stability of booster in ground winds is low<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@C3LT_Games @SciGuySpace There will be no Block 6. Moving to Starship architecture.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ebelliveau @SciGuySpace Frangible would def hurt reusability. Also, presumably those quarter sections are actuated or aero control will be impossible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SciGuySpace Good to see this. Splitting interstage into 4 sections will have some challenges, but could work.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy All Raptors have slight throttle range by adjusting flow to ox &amp; fuel turbines, but deep throttling imposes limitations on injector stiffness &amp; needs extra hardware. Swear these are legit technical terms ü§ó<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy It‚Äôs a factor. Main reason is that FFSC is the ultimate architecture for converting propellant into rocket velocity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Elthiryel @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Yes, they run at *much* higher pressure, but lower temperature. Thermal shock &amp; strain are what fatigue Merlin turbine blades. Solvable for high reusability, but better to apply that engineering to Raptor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpaceXFan97 @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Same as last time, although we made a design improvement that could yield about 7 bar more<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Merlin could probably do 1000 flights too. Turbine blade fatigue cracking would require periodic weld repair or replacement. Probably some seals &amp; bearings as well. Coking not really an issue.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Other rocket engines were designed for no (or almost no) reuse. Raptor is designed for heavy &amp; immediate reuse, like an aircraft jet engine, with inspections required only after many flights, assuming instrumentation shows it good. Using hydrostatic bearings certainly helps.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Since Raptor produces 200 tons of force, cost per ton would be $1000. However, Raptor is designed for ~1000 flights with negligible maintenance, so cost per ton over time would actually be ~$1.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HarryStoltz1 @Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy Full year production is usually ~70% of peak daily rate, so 500/year. Still, non-trivial at 100,000 tons of thrust/year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy Raptor liberated its oxygen turbine stator (appears to be mechanical, not metal combustion failure), so we need to update the design &amp; replace some parts.

<|startoftext|>@13ericralph31 @PPathole @Erdayastronaut @rmarcilhoo @kimitalvitie @SpaceXNow @ChrisG_NSF @NASASpaceflight Yeah, *way* better. Dramatically improves cost, complexity &amp; ease of operations. Distances of ~10,000 km with decent payload seem achievable at roughly Mach 20.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PPathole @Erdayastronaut @rmarcilhoo @kimitalvitie @SpaceXNow @ChrisG_NSF @NASASpaceflight Add 2 to 4 more Raptors for Starship point to point on Earth. You can go surprisingly far, even with low lift/drag. This was an unexpected result.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cleantechnica Yup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fcain @varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Would love to do exactly that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cosmic_Penguin Agreed, sent a note to Starlink team last week specifically regarding albedo reduction. We‚Äôll get a better sense of value of this when satellites have raised orbits &amp; arrays are tracking to sun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fcain @varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Exactly, potentially helping billions of economically disadvantaged people is the greater good. That said, we‚Äôll make sure Starlink has no material effect on discoveries in astronomy. We care a great deal about science.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@John_Gardi @13ericralph31 @varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Rotate on one axis. Magnetic torque rods for desaturation of momentum wheels.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoForStaging @13ericralph31 @varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Yes, already planned. We avoid use of certain lower Ku frequencies specifically for radio astronomy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1DarknessSoul5 @SpaceX Aiming for sub 20ms latency initially, sub 10ms over time, with much greater consistency than terrestrial links, as only ever a few hops to major data centers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@13ericralph31 @varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX If we need to tweak sat orientation to minimize solar reflection during critical astronomical experiments, that‚Äôs easily done. Most orbital objects are close to Earth btw, as shown by this NASA density map.  https://t.co/83MwIZAEP6  https://t.co/NllMXregRg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX There are already 4900 satellites in orbit, which people notice ~0% of the time. Starlink won‚Äôt be seen by anyone unless looking very carefully &amp; will have ~0% impact on advancements in astronomy. We need to move telelscopes to orbit anyway. Atmospheric attenuation is terrible.  https://t.co/OuWYfNmw0D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX No, Raptor uses a large number of coaxial swirl injectors, which (we believe) achieves highest theoretical mixing/combustion efficiency.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meme0boi Fair<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Super proud of SpaceX propulsion/test/materials team! One of hardest technology problems. New high temp superalloy &amp; internal foundry needed to make it work. Foundry iteration interval is ~3 weeks from design to flight part vs ~36 weeks typical for aerospace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DJSnM Only a tiny amount. There is enough air to affect the satellites &amp; allow some amount of yaw steering.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SPEXcast @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Propellant stays same, but almost everything else improves. Fundamental goal is minimize cost per ton to surface of Mars.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Great video. Couple notes: Raptor designed for subcooled CH4/O2, so propellant density &amp; thrust increase up to ~8%, as needed for mission. 380 Isp &amp; up to 50% thrust/weight improvement over time.

<|startoftext|>Reality is a Tesla, like most electric cars, is over 500% *less* likely to catch fire than combustion engine cars, which carry massive amounts of highly flammable fuel. Why is this never mentioned?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Over a million combustion engine (it‚Äôs right there in the name!) car fires per year &amp; thousands of deaths, but one Tesla car fire with no injuries gets biggest headlines. Why the double standard? This is a real question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those who predicted Tesla &amp; EVs would be dead &amp; autonomy would never happen are same people attacking Tesla today for 6-12 month delays, while ignoring major automakers 5+ years late. Why the double standard?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@martinengwicht @KnightmarArchon @EvBite @johnrobb @Tesla @ElonMuskScience I‚Äôve always thought that the fundamental good of Tesla should be measured by the number of years by which it accelerates the transition to sustainable transport &amp; energy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FredericLambert @GilesGraves @Savis1949 @WSJ I‚Äôm sorry, Fred, but WSJ has relentlessly attacked Tesla with bogus articles for over a decade. They can‚Äôt *all* be chalked up to poor reporting. Where are the WSJ expos√© pieces on oil, coal &amp; gas? That industry is 1000 times bigger than Tesla. Perhaps they‚Äôre all angels ‚Ä¶<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GinoG01328427 @Savis1949 @WSJ @Tesla Yes, this was an utter boldface (literally) lie! Unbelievable that WSJ would write something so false.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GilesGraves @Savis1949 @WSJ True, Bloomberg is almost as bad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Savis1949 @WSJ Holman Jenkins &amp; WSJ in general are sock üß¶ puppets of big oil<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grzf_ Starship is kinda Gundam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KnightmarArchon @EvBite @johnrobb Very much so. There are 2.5B cars &amp; trucks on Earth. Even replacing 1% of that fleet would require making 25M vehicles per year. Tesla will make over 500k cars in next 12 months, but that‚Äôs a mere 2% of 25M or 0.02% of global vehicle fleet. Car industry slow -&gt; demand &gt;&gt; supply.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Teslarati Sentry Mode fundamentally empowers the individual car owner over entrenched interests, in this case a corrupt traffic judge. Even Tesla doesn‚Äôt have access to the video unless sent to us by owner.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tsrandall Wow, a lot of people don‚Äôt know much about how manufacturing works! If you have peak capacity of X, actual average weekly output will necessarily be less than X. First 6-12 months, it will be much less than X. Impossible to predict exact production ramp S-curve.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tsrandall There is 35 GWh/yr ‚Äútheoretical capacity‚Äù, but actual max output is ~2/3. It was physically impossible to make more Model 3‚Äôs in Q1 due to cell constraints.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CalinRoman3 @GregMatson Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GregMatson Yes, all cars with Autopilot 2.0 or higher, so ~400,000 of Tesla cars built to date<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @kneibert Your interventions do train the NN, but we first verify that the training doesn‚Äôt cause other issues, so expect step rather than continuous changes in capability<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FredericLambert Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yaypie There will be that too, but economics will favor initial purchase<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@brandonbernicky @tsrandall Not good enough yet. Pushing release by a few weeks. Will be amazing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tsrandall Incorrect. Pana cell lines at Giga are only at ~24GWh/yr &amp; have been a constraint on Model 3 output since July. No choice but to use other suppliers for Powerwall/Powerpack cells. Tesla won‚Äôt spend money on more capacity until existing lines get closer to 35GWh theoretical.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TeslaAnswers @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag We‚Äôre going to try. Side boosters come back to Cape, center core lands on droneship. Latter will be coming in v hot &amp; fast, so dicey.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Annoying that @ULA perpetuates myth that Delta IV Heavy or Atlas V can do some orbits that Falcon Heavy can‚Äôt. This is absolutely false. FH would have to go full expendable for GEO direct, but that‚Äôs very rare.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Yeah, Falcon Heavy Block 5 has way more performance than last year‚Äôs vehicle. Lot of room to increase side booster load transfer &amp; max Q without changing any parts. FH Block 5 can launch more payload to any orbit than any vehicle currently flying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Probably no fairing either &amp; just 3 Raptor Vacuum engines. Mass ratio of ~30 (1200 tons full, 40 tons empty) with Isp of 380. Then drop a few dozen modified Starlink satellites from empty engine bays with ~1600 Isp, MR 2. Spread out, see what‚Äôs there. Not impossible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emilmelar Retrofits will start when our software is able to take meaningful advantage of the Tesla FSD computer, which is an order of magnitude more capable. For now, it‚Äôs slightly disadvantageous to have Tesla FSD computer, as our software is more refined for HW2.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MacBenTosh Anyone who bought FSD will get it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone who purchased full self-driving will get FSD computer upgrade for free. This is the only change between Autopilot HW2.5 &amp; HW3. Going forward ‚ÄúHW3‚Äù will just be called FSD Computer, which is accurate. No change to vehicle sensors or wire harness needed. This is v important.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Yes. Sensitive propulsion &amp; avionics remained dry. Great work by SpaceX Dragon engineering team. Major improvement over Dragon 1.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 You can deep throttle on single shaft system by choking flow of fuel or oxygen between pump &amp; combustion chamber.

<|startoftext|>@vincent13031925 @dave_ross @Tesla This causes some media confusion, as batch builds &amp; ship arrival times can make our sales seem incredible one month &amp; terrible following month, but consumer tastes don‚Äôt actually vary so much.

<|startoftext|>@TrevorMahlmann @Tesla @PopMech Model 3 partial permanent magnet induction motor, especially with silicon carbide inverter, is so efficient that it outdoes two induction motors.

<|startoftext|>@ColinRossUBC827 @Tesla @PopMech Exactly! In fact, better to have RWD with winter tires than AWD with summer tires. We appreciate the extra expenditure if people do buy AWD, but it isn‚Äôt critical for snowy regions.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nextspaceflight Depends on when Crew Dragon comes back. That‚Äôs scheduled for launch next Saturday, but lot of new hardware, so time error bars are big.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanzyD High probability of this particular rocket getting destroyed by Dragon supersonic abort test. Otherwise, at least 20 or 30 missions for Falcon 9. Starship will take over before the F9 fleet reaches end of life.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @sasor098 @AdamHugo @WayCharMar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey Yeah, that was a bit embarrassing ‚ò∫Ô∏èHigh engine chamber pressure and ablative don‚Äôt get along. Ok for low pressure, expendable upper stage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sasor098 @AdamHugo @WayCharMar @fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey That‚Äôs true üòÄ Merlin 1A was terrible. 1C was ok, 1D good, but block 5 Merlin (should probably be called 1E) is something special. Took about 15 years to get there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @MarekCyzio @katlinegrey Actually, they received (and still receive) almost a billion dollars a year for ‚Äúlaunch capability‚Äù. Even if they do zero launches, US govt still gives them that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geopilot @katlinegrey Don‚Äôt know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katlinegrey SpaceX commercial üöÄ launch market share went from 0% in 2010 to 65% in 2018. Despite massive subsidies to Boeing/Lockeed, they have never won a fair competition against SpaceX for several years.  https://t.co/sqAYCCcJtd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martinengwicht @macodiseas @katlinegrey Exactly. That‚Äôs the critical point for Starship/BFR: more payload than the biggest rocket ever made, but for less money per launch than the smallest (orbital) rocket. Without something that lowers orbital flight cost by 100X, humanity will never be a multiplanet species.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey SpaceX Merlin architecture is simpler than staged combustion (eg SSME or RD), but it has world record for thrust/weight &amp; thrust/cost engine.

<|startoftext|>@SPEXcast @Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX Very dependent on volume, but I‚Äôm confident moving to Mars (return ticket is free) will one day cost less than $500k &amp; maybe even below $100k. Low enough that most people in advanced economies could sell their home on Earth &amp; move to Mars if they want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpaceXFan97 @Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX This will sound implausible, but I think there‚Äôs a path to build Starship / Super Heavy for less than Falcon 9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@13ericralph31 @John_Gardi @SpaceX Close<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@John_Gardi @SpaceX But not an extendable nozzle though, as that just saves length. Nozzle diameter is limited by body diameter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpaceXFan97 @alexmd2 @SpaceX Much above 300 bar main chamber pressure means extreme oxygen preburner pressure of 700 to 800+ bar. Definitely pushing the limit of known physics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_cgp @SpaceX Propellant was not deep cryo. CH4 &amp; O2 were just barely below liquid temp at 1 bar. In theory, Raptor should do ~300 bar at deep cryo, provided everything holds together, which is far from certain. However, only 250 bar is needed for nominal operation of Starship/Super Heavy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@John_Gardi @SpaceX Yes, aiming for 380 sec Isp with vac nozzle. Maybe 382 if we get lucky.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@13ericralph31 @SpaceX I think 6 where we lit main chamber &amp; several with only preburners<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnkrausphotos @SpaceX About 11 secs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexmd2 @SpaceX Definitely! It‚Äôs amazing that the RD-170 &amp; RD-180 engines held the record for so many decades. Excellent engineering.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @LytovchenkoSerg @John_Gardi Booster center of mass is much lower &amp; more consistent (no payload mass to consider), so still biases towards engine first entry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LytovchenkoSerg @John_Gardi @Erdayastronaut Technically, the steel is radiatively cooled (not uncooled). T^4 is one of the most interesting things about reality!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LytovchenkoSerg @John_Gardi @Erdayastronaut Rocket booster temperatures won‚Äôt go much above 600 Kelvin on hottest parts of main body &amp; maybe around 1200K on base, which uncooled steel can handle. Starship is around 1700K for a Mach 25 entry, so needs shielding of some kind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Malcolmmarsman @Erdayastronaut Prob wise for version 1 to have legs or we will frag a lot of launch pads<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Teslarati ~1750K is peak heating expected on about 20% of Starship for LEO entry, ~1600K on 20%. Rest drops below 1450K, so no heat shield needed. Radiative cooling at T^4 takes care of 60% of the ship. Another reason for steel.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JP_Cautillo Wow!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JT_Richards @MMelinot @chuckyyyd This is incorrect. Vast majority of vehicle motion is returned to the battery, as the electric motors act like a generator in reverse. Brake pads on a Tesla literally never need to be replaced for lifetime of the car.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most importantly, every electric car, Tesla or otherwise, matters to the environment we all share. Every time someone chooses electric, the future gets a little bit brighter!  If not Tesla, please take a look at these other options:  https://t.co/FZVNlGWYgA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And, because electricity costs much less than gasoline, a Model 3 can cost about $1000 less per year to operate. Because it‚Äôs electric, there are no oil changes, smog checks, tuneups, fuel filter, or brake pad replacements.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are also many state &amp; local incentives, for example California offers $2500, plus $800 from utilities &amp; access to carpool lane, Colorado $4000, etc  https://t.co/lmD3ZNFR9M<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard You def don‚Äôt want electric pumps on a rocket engine! Raptor turbopumps alone need 100,000 horsepower per engine. That‚Äôs not a typo.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Yup. Actually, the only significant design element in common with early Atlas is stainless steel &amp; we‚Äôre using a different alloy mix. I super ‚ô•Ô∏è 300 Series Stainless!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard While there are some material similarities, Starship is very different from the Atlas design<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Robotbeat @michaelknaepen @ElSchumi @FredericLambert @boringcompany Exactly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @martinengwicht @realkrauswife @Tesla The guides are basically just a wheel, a shock absorber &amp; a solenoid. Costs a few hundred dollars in volume.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattRemp Yeah, it would allow many streets to become parks and walking areas. Less concrete, more trees.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martinengwicht @realkrauswife Probably only need three types: straight ramp, spiral ramp &amp; elevator. Latter only for tight spaces.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElSchumi @FredericLambert @boringcompany Passive lateral safety is required by regulators &amp; I think they‚Äôre right. Might be able to build this into the tunnel wall though. So long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing, there is probably a good safety argument.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FredericLambert @boringcompany You‚Äôre right. We did have a sim ready, but it was confusing, so I didn‚Äôt include it. We‚Äôre working on one that makes things clear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realkrauswife Pop up, park and walk!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@business Incorrect. ‚ÄúChairman‚Äù is an honorific, not executive role, which means it‚Äôs not needed to run Tesla.

<|startoftext|>@annerajb About 10 to 14 days<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, Tesla policy is that if you order a car without a test drive you get 3 days to return for full refund vs 1 day if you do get a test drive (resources are overbooked)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Important note for US Tesla buyers: Federal tax credit drops by $3750 in 3 weeks.

<|startoftext|>@vincent13031925 @teslectrics @60Minutes @MKBHD Probably next month<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@teslectrics @60Minutes You‚Äôre right. There was a ton of footage with many people at Tesla that would be great to share. Longer pieces like we did with @MKBHD tell a more interesting story.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnnaCrider1 @mundanemun @mayemusk @60Minutes @LesleyRStahl @Tesla @cleantechnica 60 Mins actually had several hours of interview time, which they distilled to 14 mins. Many stories could been told with that time. This was accurate as viewed from an Upper East Side Manhattan dinner party.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MesQueUnBanjo We are awaiting EU regulatory approval for this release<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ghhaugen Full self-driving option is required with the Tesla designed hardware 3 computer. This is a simple plug in replacement for the NVidia computer, but has over 10X the image processing ability.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Already testing traffic lights, stop signs &amp; roundabouts in development software. Your Tesla will soon be able to go from your garage at home to parking at work with no driver input at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you have a Tesla built in past 2 years, definitely try Navigate on Autopilot. It will blow your mind. Automatically passes slow cars &amp; takes highway interchanges &amp; off-ramps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RenataKonkoly @SpaceX Machete!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danwat1234 It was supposed to be, but that was a dumb decision. In the end, Roadster only had 7% of parts in common with the Lotus Elise or any other car.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Major credit to AC Propulsion for the tzero electric sports car 1997-2003 that inspired Tesla Roadster. Without that, Tesla wouldn‚Äôt exist or would have started much later.  https://t.co/NxCgYO9JXx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nichegamer Yeah, we wanted to name our company after Tesla, the great scientist/engineer, but use of the Tesla name in automotive was already trademarked in the US, Europe &amp; later China.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brandonorselli Buying  https://t.co/46TXqRrsdr took over a decade, $11M &amp; amazing amount of effort. Didn‚Äôt like  https://t.co/BsRfMrY9Gm even when we were only making üöò.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tesla history trivia: we didn‚Äôt actually come up with the Tesla Motors name. Bought trademark off Brad Siewert for $75k in late 2004. He‚Äôd originally filed for it in 1994. Our alternative name was Faraday, which was used by a competitor several years later.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @TheGledinator @w00ki33 @Teslarati The new design is metal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @w00ki33 @Teslarati As far as we know, it‚Äôs the largest single piece titanium casting in the world. Major improvement over the old aluminum grid fins, as the titanium doesn‚Äôt need heat shielding or even paint.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DJSnM Pump is single string. Some landing systems are not redundant, as landing is considered ground safety critical, but not mission critical. Given this event, we will likely add a backup pump &amp; lines.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dragonmaurizio We may use it for an internal SpaceX mission<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markkrieger Yes, cutaway was a mistake. We will show all footage, good or bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Grid fin hydraulic pump stalled, so Falcon landed just out to sea. Appears to be undamaged &amp; is transmitting data. Recovery ship dispatched.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Falcon/Dragon launch to @Space_Station in 9 minutes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattbeckman Us too sigh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Falcon fairing halves missed the net, but touched down softly in the water. Mr Steven is picking them up. Plan is to dry them out &amp; launch again. Nothing wrong with a little swim.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jennerator211 @PPathole @JohnnaCrider1 We‚Äôre adding police car, fire truck &amp; ambulance to the Tesla neural net in coming months<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnnaCrider1 Exactly. Default Autopilot behavior, if there‚Äôs no driver input, is to slow gradually to a stop &amp; turn on hazard lights. Tesla service then contacts the owner. Looking into what happened here.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bonnienorman @carpenter_maas Good advice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EESNY @teslaownersSV @S100Dfan Applying a hydrophobic coating to the radar (located just below nose of car) should help. Easy to do yourself or Tesla service can do it. We‚Äôre also working on vision-only driving.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nikesharora @Tesla Glad you‚Äôre ok<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carpenter_maas Perhaps most telling is that Norway, which is partly above the Arctic Circle, has more Teslas per capita than any other country on Earth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carpenter_maas As the battery warms up, almost all of that is recovered. There is a roughly 10% range loss for cabin heating. Cabin heating impact on range is higher in slow traffic, but range is also higher in slow traffic.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NBCNews This is completely backwards. Based on what we‚Äôve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we‚Äôre moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA. Won‚Äôt need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can summon your Tesla from your phone. Only short distances today, but in a few years summon will work from across the continent.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Supercharger V3, which starts rolling out early next year, will also charge much faster<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tesla Supercharger capacity will double by end of next year. Expect to be within range of 95% to 100% of population in all active markets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scottymeuk @ScaleyMurrsuit No, it‚Äôs got enough load capacity &amp; volume to carry the battery pack &amp; our current pack energy density is about double that of original Roadster. Still, it would probably only save about 30% to 40% of effort, all things considered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FredericLambert @frozencanuck @ScaleyMurrsuit In order of resource priority, but not necessarily production ramp, as that depends on thousands of parts &amp; processes, which are extremely difficult to forecast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tsrandall @frozencanuck @ScaleyMurrsuit What really matters is time to volume production, not initial market intro. Apart from brief moments, Tesla vehicle production is limited by total battery output.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frozencanuck @ScaleyMurrsuit Lot on our plate, so it‚Äôs either get van gliders (no battery, powertrain or compute tech) from Daimler &amp; produce sooner or do all &amp; produce later. Not a big difference to total vehicles produced either way. Priority list is Model Y, solar roof tiles, pickup, semi, Roadster.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @annerajb Won‚Äôt land propulsively for those reasons. Ultra light heat shield &amp; high Mach control surfaces are what we can‚Äôt test well without orbital entry. I think we have a handle on propulsive landings.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@annerajb @vincent13031925 @Teslarati @panasonic Recently asked service team to expand locations to all population regions (not just major metros) in North America, Eastern Europe, China &amp; Japan by end of next year. We are completely missing vast geographic regions in some cases.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vincent13031925 @Teslarati @panasonic To clarify further, the long-term goal for Tesla mass market products is local production for local markets (at least at the continent level). This is critical to make pricing as affordable as possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vincent13031925 @Teslarati @panasonic Tesla will manufacture all battery modules &amp; packs at China Giga, as we do today in California &amp; Nevada. Cell production will be sourced locally, most likely from several companies (incl Pana), in order to meet demand in a timely manner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Teslarati Amazing results by @Panasonic at Tesla Gigafactory Nevada! Very much appreciate extreme hard work it took to achieve this result. Together with Pana Japan cell plants, Tesla/Pana partnership is producing ~60% of global EV battery output!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sk2sno @rtk86 @sheldonth @FactsDataTruth @Tesla We will enable track mode for all performance cars<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FredericLambert It was underpriced. Anyway, if you want $5k refund &amp; free Supercharging turned off, we will do that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rtk86 @sheldonth @FactsDataTruth @Tesla Ok, we will turn off lifetime free Supercharging and give you $5k refund<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ctgm @FredericLambert Yeah, or free lifetime Supercharging, whichever you prefer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FredericLambert Didn‚Äôt you get free Supercharging for life? Current buyers don‚Äôt get that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@annerajb @FredericLambert @pjj_knowles @yames51 @DigitalDunzey Exactly. That‚Äôs Monday.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FredericLambert Just did that to correct the front design esthetic of Model S. The nose of an electric car shouldn‚Äôt look like a radiator grill opening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get this question a lot, so need to clarify that there‚Äôs no such thing as a Tesla ‚Äúrefresh‚Äù. Other car companies do this every ~3 years, but Tesla constantly upgrades vehicle hardware every week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To simplify production, many Tesla Model S &amp; X interior configs, will no longer be available after Nov 1. Order now to be sure of the one you want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cleantechnica Model 3 body design could def be less complex, but, yes, most of weight difference is due to higher safety vs other cars<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ajmarquez True, but this will improve dramatically over next several months &amp; all Tesla cars ever produced (except early Roadsters) will get improvements for free. Continuous, free over-the-air software updates is a big part of why a Tesla retains so much value over time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Same goes for all countries within which we officially operate by end of next year<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SmileSimplify @j_brorsson @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert ~6 months before it is in all new production cars. No change to sensors. This is simple replacement of the Autopilot computer. Will be done free of charge for those who ordered full self-driving.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@j_brorsson @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Somewhere between 500% &amp; 2000%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert To be clear, actual NN improvement is significantly overestimated in this article. V9.0 vs V8.1 is more like a ~400% increase in useful ops/sec due to enabling integrated GPU &amp; better use of discrete GPU.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert This is without the Tesla NN computer. Per my public comments, that will give the car an extra order of magnitude.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@martyeuler @MebFaber Fair point üòÄ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MebFaber When something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Way the trick works is companies like Blackrock keep up to 50% of short interest revenue, but suffer almost none of equity decline, as they‚Äôre just ‚Äúpassive‚Äù managers. Blackrock made $597M in short lending last year!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MebFaber Not all. However, shorting applied to market as a whole is obv net negative ‚Äî it incents negative gdp! Moreover, it stops private companies from going public, preventing access by retirement funds &amp; small investors, thus increasing wealth divide.  https://t.co/7jk2Bs56HR<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@annerajb @KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman The CIO of a major pension fund is the one who deserves credit for uncovering this scam<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@annerajb @KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman The big funds can &amp; will, as they‚Äôre suffering a net loss. Index managers like Blackrock pocket make excessive profit from short lending while pretending to charge low rates for ‚Äúpassive‚Äù index tracking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dlauer @KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman Debatably true, if applied to individual stocks selectively &amp; consciously, but obv false if applied broadly to most of the market &amp; without clear consent of the shareholder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman Where this breaks down is in passive index funds, which constitute most of the market. The holders of those funds, mostly small investors &amp; retirement funds, don‚Äôt realize that their stocks are being lent to short sellers, diminishing their true equity return.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KishavanBhola @enn_nafnlaus @ElonBachman There is no rational basis for a long holder to lend their stock to shorts, as it dilutes the shareholder base &amp; gives the short a strong incentive to attack the company by whatever means possible, including regulators<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LanceUlanoff Consider an ice skater. Same weight, but spins/turns much faster with arms in vs arms out. Same principle is true for a car.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LanceUlanoff Front vs rear wheel weight distribution, though commonly asked, isn't the right question. You can have 50% on front, 50% on rear &amp; still have poor handling if mass elements are far from center. Dumbbell mass distribution is bad, spinning top/dreidel is good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LanceUlanoff Simple explanation of polar moment of inertia &amp; other important car terms at  https://t.co/CftQ1v9YCL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LanceUlanoff Key technical point is that the polar moment of inertia (concentration of mass around center) of a Tesla, to the extent of our knowledge, is better than any other production car. This positively affects safety, handling &amp; driving feel. Extremely important metric.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martinengwicht @BlondesE A car propelled by combustion is far more likely to combust than an electric car<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LanceUlanoff Yes, when it comes to physics, make sure Newton is on your side<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LanceUlanoff Helps improve forward crumple zone length, especially important in high speed frontal impacts, and moments of inertia in side impacts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tesla piece on the physics of car safety coming soon for those interested in technical details<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MartenBenjamin @NHTSAgov @Tesla Exactly, all 5 star are *not* the same, as the videos show. ‚Äú5 star‚Äù just means a car met a certain threshold, but injury probability stats (real numbers) tell you by how much.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StarFire2258 You‚Äôre right on both counts. Most houses in Flint have safe water, but they‚Äôve lost faith in govt test results. Some houses are still outliers.

<|startoftext|>@jonodiener Maybe rewarding to organize a barnstorming weekend for water filter installation?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonodiener For now, reply to my tweet with ppm &amp; ppb test results &amp; will send someone to install a water filter. Creating email flint@x.com, but I‚Äôm in China so that won‚Äôt be working until tomorrow.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LanceUlanoff @BBCWorld Good for rescuing vulnerable patients in dangerous environments, particularly if water, toxic gas or dangerous bacteria/viruses present, as patient would remain dry &amp; at std air pressure entire time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sarthk007 @BBCWorld Yes, it was specifically designed to pass that point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCWorld Moreover, based on extensive cave video review &amp; discussion with several divers who know journey, SpaceX engineering is absolutely certain that mini-sub can do entire journey &amp; demonstrate at any time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCWorld The former Thai provincial governor (described inaccurately as ‚Äúrescue chief‚Äù) is not the subject matter expert. That would be Dick Stanton, who co-led the dive rescue team. This is our direct correspondence:  https://t.co/dmC9l3jiZR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great news that they made it out safely. Congratulations to an outstanding rescue team!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@teslamodel3fan @Tesla Ok<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just returned from Cave 3. Mini-sub is ready if needed. It is made of rocket parts &amp; named Wild Boar after kids‚Äô soccer team. Leaving here in case it may be useful in the future. Thailand is so beautiful.  https://t.co/EHNh8ydaTT<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JaneidyEve Yes. Those videos are from this morning.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KyleBrubaker Diver weight belts wrapped around outside. Mini-sub only weighs ~40kg dry, so easy to carry on long dry sections of cave, then add weight belts for wet sections.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PPathole @JimmyVosika @dcliem Yeah, that sounds cool. Music makes things better. Calms the mind. Adding padded wall pockets for a hand radio &amp; phone/music player.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@astrography__ @dcliem Aluminum shell has high thermal conductivity, so will be close to ambient. If ambient is cold, a thin layer of neoprene insulation around interior will keep occupant warm.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dirkbonhomme @JelteDesign @maysacha Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JelteDesign @maysacha Fitted for a kid or small adult to minimize open air. Segmented compartments to place rocks or dive weights &amp; adjust bouyancy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abroadwithalec @maysacha Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maysacha 4 handles/hitch points on front &amp; 4 on rear. 2 air tank connections on front &amp; 2 on rear, allowing 1 to 4 tanks simultaneously connected, all recessed for impact protection w secondary cap seal if leak develops.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thanr @ablack82 I‚Äôm in LA working with the SpaceX team building the kid mini-sub<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aiyanaskye Construction complete in about 8 hours, then 17 hour flight to Thailand<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Continue to be amazed by the bravery, resilience &amp; tenacity of kids &amp; diving team in Thailand. Human character at its best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got more great feedback from Thailand. Primary path is basically a tiny, kid-size submarine using the liquid oxygen transfer tube of Falcon rocket as hull. Light enough to be carried by 2 divers, small enough to get through narrow gaps. Extremely robust.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VoltzCoreAudio Ground winds would<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VoltzCoreAudio Yes. All-weather. ~300km/h high altitude winds. ~60km/h ground winds. It‚Äôs a beast.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jevjack1 Can‚Äôt be too buoyant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some good feedback from cave experts in Thailand. Iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to try. Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks. Less likely to work, given tricky contours, but great if it does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArkadiuszKula @JL2579 @MattyIce4412 @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Good idea<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JL2579 @MattyIce4412 @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Prob wise to add an air tank (butt end fwd to take impacts) in nose of pod &amp; vent valve in rear. Set air tank to slow bleed rate, then no need for SCUBA mouthpiece or regulator. Training unnecessary &amp; less susceptible to panic attack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LittleMissFlint You‚Äôre welcome. Happy birthday! üéÅüéâüéÇ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattyIce4412 @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Yeah, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about in that tweet ‚Äî double-layer Kevlar pressure pod with Teflon coating. Other approach is a long inflatable air sock. Both worth trying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@williamwinters @austinhopperrrr @maysacha @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Exactly. You can put socks on your feet the same way. There would be no relative motion between the tube &amp; rock wall.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremysliew It‚Äôs open so that others who are closer to the problem can consider this as one possible solution<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@siwgrindaker @erikveen Should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate, unless there is a very big hole. If oxygen % is dropping, suggests that leak holes are not large.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erikveen I would def recommend this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thanr @JamesWorldSpace Building double-layer Kevlar pressure pods with Teflon coating to slip by rocks &amp; front/rear rope tow hitch &amp; lead pockets for neutral buoyancy. ~60 cm oval. Testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done SCUBA. Do the divers think something like this might work?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bonnienorman @TeslaBull @trippedover Interesting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thanr @JamesWorldSpace Great, thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesWorldSpace Inflatable tubes &amp; pods being made out of Kevlar for better abrasion resistance. A SpaceX engineer happens to be in Thailand &amp; is headed there now. Could one of the divers DM me? Need approx contour of most difficult sections for tube fab.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ladykayaker @JamesWorldSpace So long as air pressure in tube higher than water pressure, air will blow out &amp; water won‚Äôt come in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thanr @JamesWorldSpace Does you know output voltage &amp; amperage of those generator trucks? 3 phase? What frequency? Will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick cable. Beyond that, only batteries will work. Will prep Powerwalls in case needed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesWorldSpace SpaceX &amp; Boring Co engineers headed to Thailand tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to govt. There are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesWorldSpace Looks like 1st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. 2nd &amp; 3rd would need battery packs, air pumps &amp; tubes. If depth of 2nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up &amp; then transit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chiefpad @JamesWorldSpace So long as air feed rate exceeds leak rate, tube remains inflated. This is how bouncy castles or inflatable mazes work. Needs very little power as the work (physics def of work) done is low. Pumping out water faster than it enters the cave system is prob 10X to 1000X more power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chiefpad @JamesWorldSpace Have a small velcro slit entrance &amp; exit in circumferential direction (half stress of longitudinal direction)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ladykayaker @JamesWorldSpace Walking speed is around 5km/h, but if you‚Äôre in an air tube, time doesn‚Äôt matter much. If tube diameter was 1.5m, a fast walk of 5km would take 40 mins or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesWorldSpace Maybe worth trying: insert a 1m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network &amp; inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof &amp; auto-conform to odd shapes like the 70cm hole.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cate_long @lopezlinette Exactly. A journalist who publicly expresses love for &amp; parties in Vegas with a prominent shortseller of any given company should disclose this when writing articles.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tombrechet @vassilyk @FlatJannrickles @vincent13031925 @TeslaBull @scottwww @stetopinini @S_Padival @lopezlinette @Tesla Sounds fishy. How did that go down?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@vincent13031925 @TeslaBull @scottwww @stetopinini @S_Padival @lopezlinette So @lopezlinette publicly stated she stans for Chanos, Tesla‚Äôs most prominent short-seller.

<|startoftext|>@scottwww @stetopinini @S_Padival @lopezlinette .@lopezlinette You stated publicly that you ‚Äúsee eye to eye‚Äù with Chanos, the most prominent short-seller of Tesla. Have you ever provided him with material non-public information about Tesla?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeslaBull What a coincidence ‚Ä¶<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesheetztweetz @CNBC @Lebeaucarnews Am not attacking all media or even all of @CNBC. Just asked if you inform public about an analyst‚Äôs prediction track record about a subject when putting them on your show.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stetopinini @S_Padival @lopezlinette Indeed, very simple question.

Did he, under that inducement, provide you with exaggerated negative info, which you printed, but turned out to be untrue?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benjaminpollock @CNBC Exactly. @cnbc, I just asked a simple question. Please answer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ICannot_Enough @SimRiyat @gawwy @aperezposada @Reuters @sal19 Strange. @cnbc, is it true that you are putting on analysts with such low ratings &amp; extremely bad prediction records?

<|startoftext|>@S_Padival @lopezlinette Sounds very sketchy if true. @lopezlinette, is it possible you‚Äôre  serving as an inside trading source for one of Tesla‚Äôs biggest short-sellers? An ex-Tesla employee just went on record formally claiming you bribed him &amp; he sent you valuable Tesla IP in exchange. Is this true?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@S_Padival @lopezlinette has published several false articles about Tesla, including a doozy where she claimed Tesla scrapped more batteries than our total S,X &amp;3 production number, which is physically impossible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gawwy @aperezposada @Reuters @sal19 Wow, so @sal19 of @Reuters wrote article that misled public about Model 3 production &amp; followed that up with mean tweet to me on my bday. Nice work @sal19 &amp; @Reuters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aperezposada @Reuters .@Reuters, why did you mislead the people public about this number?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aperezposada @Reuters .@Reuters is relentlessly negative about Tesla. They just wrote a bogus article saying S production last week was low by 800 cars.

<|startoftext|>@vplikeTRUMP @jorendewachter @xJawz @joerogan @MazzucatoM Yes, consumption tax is way better. Also, higher estate tax better than income/cap gains tax. Probability of progeny being equally excellent at capital allocation is not high.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeacefulChaos7 @DanAloni @xJawz @joerogan Exactly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jorendewachter @xJawz @joerogan @MazzucatoM He‚Äôs obv wrong. Forcing function for any 100% mkt share monopolist to improve is weak &amp; a national govt is that by fiat. One may find lowish correlation for negativity, but that does not mean low causation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EvilCorpGame Great name. A little on the nose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanAloni @xJawz @joerogan That‚Äôs really decision about how good you think govt is at allocating capital. Buffett, for example, is vastly better than any govt at allocating capital. Consumption vs capital allocation extremely misunderstood. Biggest missing piece in public understanding of what ‚Äúmoney‚Äù is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xJawz @joerogan Yeah, all-inclusive tax rate of 40% seems about right. Below 30% is unrealistic for critical govt functions unless national defense is de facto outsourced &amp; above 50% too negatively affects economic output.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@iamJeffTorres @thehartej @yaronbrook @VitalikButerin I think essential services, incl health care, should be taken care of by govt/taxpayers (socialist) &amp; other parts of economy should be served by companies competing to serve the people (capitalist).

<|startoftext|>Well said  https://t.co/lDPaIPLLzO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeslaCharts Then you‚Äôll be fine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnnaSabri @indiemusicfan9 @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow Exactly. Our NDA is actually shorter &amp; simpler than most.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@indiemusicfan9 @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow ...which clearly doesn‚Äôt work. UAW and Wall Street shorts know every detail of what‚Äôs happening at Tesla. Storm clouds are gathering, so they‚Äôre getting desperate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doctorow @dimas_______ @Robotbeat Then look a little closer, doctorow. Read the whole thread.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@indiemusicfan9 @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow More propaganda. The NDA only prevents disclosure of Tesla proprietary IP or material non-public information (insider trading).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeslaCharts How big is your short position? Just curious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BobbieBees @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow Union flyers are handed out all the time in the factory. I know because people in the factory laugh at the ridiculous propaganda &amp; hand them to me. This one guy‚Äôs claim about being stopped once in a parking lot is false and irrelevant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doctorow I endorse freedom to form a union too, as well as freedom not to do so if they feel Tesla is a good company. UAW has major conflicts of interest &amp; failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in 2010. Tesla can only hire 5% of applicants, so must be doing something right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow UAW doesn‚Äôt have 30% of signatures (about 6000 people) needed for a vote. They can‚Äôt even muster enough people for a free bbq. Instead, they‚Äôre getting paid trolls &amp; far left shills to trash Tesla &amp; me in press &amp; social media. Such creeps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSithSeth @doctorow I‚Äôm not against all unions, but UAW has a track record of destroying productivity so a company can‚Äôt compete on world market. Our current factory went bankrupt under UAW before we took it over. Don‚Äôt want Tesla to die too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robotbeat @doctorow I am too, of sorts. Govt (ie other taxpayers) should take care of critical needs of people, incl defense, judiciary, health care, etc. Rest should be companies competing to provide best product or service to the people.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Erdayastronaut @Lord_Lima_Bean @UHDDreamer @LanceUlanoff Trade is just that Roadster becomes a 2 seater instead of a 2+2. COPV in place of the kid seats, which is prob wise for many reasons<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lord_Lima_Bean @UHDDreamer @LanceUlanoff Exactly. Total energy stored even in ultra compressed air is low vs battery, but power output is insane.

<|startoftext|>@raptorweb Sigh. This is crux of matter: can‚Äôt make system too annoying or people won‚Äôt use it, negatively affecting safety, but also can‚Äôt allow people to get too complacent or safety again suffers. Latest update should have a positive effect on latter issue especially.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Off_thewalls @MKBHD @joerogan A lot of people whose judgment I respect have suggested this. Sounds like a good idea. Will do so after Model 3 production reaches 5k/week steady.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VHollywood21 Yes. Hopefully, I‚Äôm not tempting fate too much with that date. It was meant as a joke, but is about the right actual timing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MKBHD Will do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bartjehoel @djenkins6 Correct, pure electric. Wish orbital rockets could be so too, but there‚Äôs no escaping Newton‚Äôs Third Law. SpaceX is already developing high efficiency CO2 capture with H2O to form liquid CH4 (methane) &amp; O2. Critical for propellant production at Mars Base Alpha.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MKBHD You have my word, Marques. Next gen Roadster will be absolutely out of this world. For those who love to drive, there is no finer car in history and we don‚Äôt think there will be another.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LanceUlanoff Note, gas contained would be ultra high pressure air in a SpaceX rocket COPV bottle. The air exiting the thrusters would immediately be replenished whenever vehicle pack power draw allowed operation of the air pump, which is most of the time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LanceUlanoff Intent of new Tesla Roadster is to beat gas sports cars on every performance metric by far, no exceptions, thus transferring the ‚Äúhalo crown‚Äù effect gas cars have as the top speed leaders over to pure electric.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anandrajk @lexiheft @Tesla That issue is better in latest Autopilot software rolling out now &amp; fully fixed in August update as part of our long-awaited Tesla Version 9.

<|startoftext|>@FredericLambert In early 90s, I wrote a multitasker for PCs that spoofed the CPU &amp; CD-ROM to act in parallel, so could read video continuously while player sprite moved smoothly.

<|startoftext|>@FredericLambert That‚Äôs quite a blast from the past! After my Zip2 experience w patents, I felt that patents (particularly software) inhibited innovation, instead of fostering it.

<|startoftext|>@dancow @tedhu @chadgowens @scottwww @JessicaHuseman That was obvious from a mile away. I tried to use their product &amp; it didn‚Äôt work. Not exactly a genius move by WSJ, but they were brave enough to say it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DMC_Ryan @teslanomicsco @Tesla Maybe after you get your Model 3, we can talk about what you like &amp; what needs to be improved<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DMC_Ryan @teslanomicsco But consider it real. We could unveil Model Y anytime from late this year to mid next year, so March 15 is about right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DMC_Ryan @teslanomicsco I just made that up, because the Ides of March sounded good<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@karaswisher Hi Kara! I‚Äôm open to it. Right now, I‚Äôm cranking super hard at the Tesla factory, so it depends on how things are going next week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe the media credibility rating site should be called ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Right!‚Äù  I do actually own  https://t.co/1JqqCF9inA, but for the moment I just have it automatically forward to Facebook News.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PolitiFact I just tried to donate, but you don‚Äôt accept PayPal. Lmk when you do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adnroy Um, you just tweeted about this, so obv you do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@southtopia Thank you! I thought it was so obvious ‚Ä¶<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AltWouss @jackallisonLOL @ParkerMolloy Exactly. UAW does not have individual stock ownership as part of the compensation at any other company.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PolitiFact Yeah, I think you do great work<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you‚Äôre in media &amp; don‚Äôt want Pravda to exist, write an article telling your readers to vote against it ‚Ä¶<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meharris ü§ó<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ParkerMolloy I‚Äôve never stopped a union vote nor removed a union. UAW abandoned this factory. Tesla arrived &amp; gave people back their jobs. They haven‚Äôt forgotten UAW betrayed them. That‚Äôs why UAW can‚Äôt even get people to attend a free BBQ, let alone enough sigs for a vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meharris Of course<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scottwww @JessicaHuseman It is strange that big auto companies literally have thousands more factory injuries than Tesla &amp; millions more auto deaths, but somehow get less coverage. We are not perfect, but we‚Äôre doing our best to make clean energy real &amp; be a good company.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JessicaHuseman @reveal No, they‚Äôre just some rich kids in Berkeley who took their political science prof too seriously<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iShashankBhatia Will do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Create a media credibility rating site (that also flags propaganda botnets)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scotch_io That‚Äôs why editors are included too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SophieWarnes We don‚Äôt. The media is reporting someone else saying that Tesla advertised. It is untrue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even if some of the public doesn‚Äôt care about the credibility score, the journalists, editors &amp; publications will. It is how they define themselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DetroitVictoria Enough of the public does care about the truth. I have faith in the people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AntVenom Maybe some good people from those orgs who would join<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Virtualanom Not only needs to be botproof, but seek &amp; unmask anyone operating a disinformation bot army<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sakiwebo Exactly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Going to create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article &amp; track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor &amp; publication. Thinking of calling it Pravda ‚Ä¶<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dancow @WSJ An exception that proves the rule<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CodyBrown Uh, this is Twitter. How many characters do you want?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Problem is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks &amp; earn advertising dollars or get fired. Tricky situation, as Tesla doesn‚Äôt advertise, but fossil fuel companies &amp; gas/diesel car companies are among world‚Äôs biggest advertisers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@teddymonacelli The media has earned this mistrust. But maybe there is a solution.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaspar Oh hey another sanctimonious media person who thinks he‚Äôs above criticism. Try being truthful &amp; the public will believe you again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andyjayhawk Thought you‚Äôd say that. Anytime anyone criticizes the media, the media shrieks ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just like Trump!‚Äù Why do you think he got elected in the first place? Because no ones believes you any more. You lost your credibility a long time ago.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AustinOnSocial Great idea!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@annerajb @ericbrownzzz @dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA Will do it later this year. Too much on plate right now. Will be available as an upgrade from service.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeusEx Love original Deus Ex! That would be awesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UAW @speea @AlterViggo @juliacarriew Interesting he stops at ‚Äò09. That‚Äôs when you drove GM &amp; Chrysler into bankruptcy &amp; lost tens of thousands of jobs for people that counted on you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthunter Just order your car with the James Bond option package. It‚Äôs an off-menu item for those in the know üòâ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ericbrownzzz @dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA But ya know what, let‚Äôs test that theory. Maybe we do want UAW back, even tho UAW betrayed us 8 years ago &amp; left us here to rot. Maybe we want UAW back even tho injury rate today is 1/2 what it was with them &amp; wages were lower. Maybe. Let‚Äôs hold a vote &amp; find out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@speea @AlterViggo @juliacarriew In theory true, but not how UAW behaved. They drove GM &amp; Chrysler to bankruptcy &amp; lost 200,000+ jobs for people they were supposed to protect, incl abandoning NUMMI plant workers.Tesla took over &amp; now it has 10k+ jobs.UAW destroyed once great US auto industry &amp; everyone knows it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We‚Äôre going to include some fun games as hidden Easter eggs in Tesla S, X &amp; 3. What do you think would be most fun in a car using the center touch screen?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OldManLink Good point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ericbrownzzz @dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA No, UAW does that. They want divisiveness &amp; enforcement of 2 class ‚Äúlords &amp; commoners‚Äù system. That sucks. US fought War of Independence to get *rid* of a 2 class system! Managers &amp; workers shd be equal w easy movement either way. Managing sucks btw. Hate doing it so much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikeyfranklin @dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA More ‚ÄúReveal‚Äù bs. Tesla is overseen by Cal/OSHA, most stringent labor safety org in US, &amp; they‚Äôve never found us to misrepresent. On other hand, Ford, Chrysler &amp; GM (UAW) have repeatedly been found to fake safety numbers. Strangely, that info is missing from Reveal article ‚Ä¶<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahKnuckey @JeffBezos @Oprah @kobebryant @richardbranson @shanesmith30 No problem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahKnuckey @JeffBezos @Oprah @kobebryant @richardbranson @shanesmith30 They are incorrect. We never met, nor have we ever been scheduled to meet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DMC_Ryan @loganthefirst Thanks again, have conveyed your words to the Tesla team, who have been working crazy hard. Really energizing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahKnuckey @JeffBezos @Oprah @kobebryant @richardbranson @shanesmith30 I didn‚Äôt meet with him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dinisguarda I definitely don‚Äôt do this 5 minute thing. Need to have long uninterrupted times to think. Can‚Äôt be creative otherwise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just wanted to say thanks to all Tesla supporters. I damn well love you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rrosenbl @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert @Tesla Have been meaning to get around to talking to him. Some of his criticisms are valid, but, on the higher body/chassis weight front, he wasn‚Äôt fully appreciating that we were going for much higher crash safety levels than other cars.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DMC_Ryan @loganthefirst Thanks Ryan. Critical feedback after you get the car would be much appreciated, no matter how nuanced.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samuelrogg @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert To be clear, all Model 3 cars, incl early production will have same great braking ability. Nature of any product, however, is that if you care about perfection, you make constant small refinements. Today‚Äôs Model S is far more refined than initial production.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rrosenbl @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert ABS calibration algorithm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Also, Consumer Reports has an early production car. Model 3 now has improved ride comfort, lower wind noise &amp; many other small improvements. Will request that they test current production.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update. Will be rolling that out in a few days. With further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. Tesla won‚Äôt stop until Model 3 has better braking than any remotely comparable car.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@camgfrost @DMC_Ryan @loganthefirst Stop, you‚Äôre making me blush ‚ò∫Ô∏è<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DMC_Ryan @loganthefirst Also, not promising anything, but we *might* be able to increase Model 3 Performance power output a little<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DMC_Ryan @loganthefirst Complexity is the devil. Words can‚Äôt express how hard we are working on the Model 3 production ramp &amp; trying to get to profitability. But we‚Äôll try.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@teslaology @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Good point. Yeah, we will do that for the bigger locations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LanceUlanoff The CR braking result is inconsistent with other reviewers, but might indicate that some Model 3‚Äôs have longer braking distances than others. If so, we will address this at our expense. First time we‚Äôve seen anything like this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Even if a physical upgrade is needed to existing fleet, we will make sure all Model 3‚Äôs having amazing braking ability at no expense to customers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Very strange. Model 3 is designed to have super good stopping distance &amp; others reviewers have confirmed this. If there is vehicle variability, we will figure it out &amp; address. May just be a question of firmware tuning, in which case can be solved by an OTA software update.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reveal @dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA @Al_Letson Cool, we can do the interview at Tesla in front of the yellow barriers &amp; beeping forklifts you said didn‚Äôt exist. Please send your meeting request to wakassliar@tesla.com.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Dani21 @dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA ‚ô•Ô∏èü¶Ñ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA Also, UAW did nada for job security in last recession. Dropped Fremont like a hot potato to protect their core base in Detroit. UAW *chose* to exit this plant before Tesla even arrived. We had nothing to do with UAW leaving, but everything to do with why people here have jobs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues &amp; give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW &amp; everybody already gets healthcare.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA Tesla factory literally has miles of painted yellow lines &amp; tape. Report about forklifts not beeping is also bs. These are both demonstrably false, but were reported as ‚Äúfacts‚Äù by Reveal.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ivanovi_ivaylo With production, 1st you need achieve target rate &amp; then smooth out flow to achieve target cost. Shipping min cost Model 3 right away wd cause Tesla to lose money &amp; die. Need 3 to 6 months after 5k/wk to ship $35k Tesla &amp; live.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willardslammo @marshall5912 @buckycovington @MacTechGenius That means nothing. Literally your Mom could file for NLRB.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MacTechGenius @marshall5912 @buckycovington Exactly üöÄüí´üéâ! That will be really fun &amp; shed light on what‚Äôs happening. Hoping to start that later this year after we become profitable. Difficult to justify before then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marshall5912 @buckycovington @MacTechGenius Yeah, ‚ÄúReveal‚Äù was carefully constructed propaganda with a name that wd make Orwell proud. Workplace injury rate of our factory when it was UAW w Toyota/GM was twice as high as today‚Äôs non-union.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marshall5912 @buckycovington @MacTechGenius About 2% of Tesla, incl salaried &amp; hourly, union &amp; non-union were let go in annual review. Only known union person fired was a guy who repeatedly threatened non-union supporters verbally &amp; on social media &amp; lied about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AKSINGH_S Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KingLutron @marshall5912 @buckycovington @MacTechGenius Exactly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marshall5912 @buckycovington @MacTechGenius They can form a union whenever they want &amp; there‚Äôs nothing I can do to stop them. California is a very pro-union state. They just don‚Äôt want to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmacguyscott Upgrade to the latest S. Nothing will give you greater joy. It‚Äôs like being able to have dopamine jacked straight into your brain at will.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Josh_Soto They are correct. It‚Äôs awesome. Second best driving feel of any car in the world imo, apart from Model S. Traction control precision is super tight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimmyRussellExe It does so constantly, but so smoothly that you can‚Äôt tell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AntVenom @zacharyj98 Depends on when you placed your initial reservation. We start delivering the dual motor Model 3 in July.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Josh_Soto Three or four months, depending on demand level. We have enough for about 1000/week right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zacharyj98 Good idea ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MacTechGenius That is true. Electric motors are far more reliable than combustion engines. You need an electric motor just to start a gas engine!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front &amp; a motor in rear. One is optimized for power &amp; one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination &amp; don‚Äôt get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also 310 miles. Takes 0-60mph to 4.5 sec &amp; top speed to 140 mph.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PPathole Black &amp; white interior available only for Model 3 Performance initially due to limited parts availability. Will broaden over time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tesla AWD is dual motor, so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc  is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but 15% quicker &amp; with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tesla dual motor, all-wheel drive performance Model 3: 3.5 sec  0-60mph  155 mph Top Speed 310 mile Range<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@plot_qasc It‚Äôs only slightly more expensive to Tesla (same price to car owners), but owner happiness is way higher, so worth doing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clemyeung Exactly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will soon enable Tesla owners to request service from their phone with a few taps. Tesla Ranger will come to you to take care of your car. No need to bring the car in yourself &amp; zero paperwork.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@andrewbg Time will tell, but so far it appears so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kasabiii It certainly needs to be better &amp; we work to improve it every day, but perfect is enemy of good. A system that, on balance, saves lives &amp; reduces injuries should be released.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What‚Äôs actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It‚Äôs super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage  https://t.co/6gD8MzD6VU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sokane1 @TalkTesla @Techmeme @timkhiggins Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TalkTesla @Techmeme @timkhiggins According to NHTSA, there was an automotive fatality every 86M miles in 2017 (~40,000 deaths). Tesla was every 320M miles. It‚Äôs not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla. We will be reporting updated safety numbers after each quarter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Techmeme @timkhiggins This is false. Eyetracking rejected for being ineffective, not for cost. WSJ fails to mention that Tesla is safest car on road, which would make article ridiculous. Approx 4X better than avg.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RitaJKing Rate at which things are getting more bizarre appears to be increasing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DylanNeumann2 @Everman Exactly. Gasoline cars will be like steam engines ‚Äî quaint, but not something you‚Äôd actually use to get around. Btw, I like steam engines &amp; trains in general.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@existentialcoms Our giant auto co competitors have much greater access to incentives than Tesla, which means Tesla has prospered in spite of govt subsidies, not because of them. Tesla mkt cap has *risen* over time as EV incentives declined. How strange ‚Ä¶<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnthonyFultz @DMC_Ryan I love it too, but trying to keep config simple so as not to blow up the production ramp<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mr_calico @FredericLambert Yup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GlobalProTrader @wmiddelkoop True. And once they were on the call, I should have answered their questions live. It was foolish of me to ignore them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshgans We went through the same drama on S &amp; X and almost all confirmed in the end. Will likely be even better for Model 3, as customer satisfaction score post delivery is higher. I worry zero about demand. Just spent all night in the factory, not the showroom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reason RBC question about Model 3 demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising &amp; no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching 5k/week production, it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to 0.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The reason the Bernstein question about CapEx was boneheaded was that it had already been answered in the headline of the Q1 newsletter he received beforehand, along with details in the body of the letter<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MarekCyzio Exactly<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MKBHD @HyperChangeTV To be clear, I‚Äôm a big fan of MKBHD, but this is an important clarification<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MKBHD @HyperChangeTV The ‚Äúdry‚Äù questions were not asked by investors, but rather by two sell-side analysts who were trying to justify their Tesla short thesis. They are actually on the *opposite* side of investors. HyperChange represented actual investors, so I switched to them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NoceraBV @WSJ @Tesla Not criticizing, just as asking questions. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a really great answer ‚Ä¶<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WSJ Tesla policy is to issue a recall *before* there are injuries. This is absolutely the right thing to do. Yet there were dozens of recalls by other car companies last month, incl w injuries &amp; deaths, but you only wrote an article about Tesla. Why so?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nextspaceflight A third is under construction<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DJSnM @doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght Under consideration. We‚Äôve already stretched the upper stage once. Easiest part of the rocket to change. Fairing 2, flying soon, also has a slightly larger diameter. Could make fairing much longer if need be &amp; will if BFR takes longer than expected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavideDF_ @doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght Side boosters landing on droneships &amp; center expended is only ~10% performance penalty vs fully expended. Cost is only slightly higher than an expended F9, so around $95M.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dlxinorbit @doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght That was three years ago, before ULA cancelled all medium versions of Delta IV. Future missions have all Delta fixed costs piled on, so their cost is now $600M+ for missions contracted for launch after 2020. Nutty high.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght Both exhaust velocity (Isp) and mass ratio drive the rocket equation. Also thrust/mass matters a lot for Oberth effect. Delta upper stage Isp is good, but mass ratio and thrust are not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght The performance numbers in this database are not accurate. In process of being fixed. Even if they were, a fully expendable Falcon Heavy, which far exceeds the performance of a Delta IV Heavy, is $150M, compared to over $400M for Delta IV Heavy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kabirakhtar Yeah, it‚Äôs terrible. Had to upgrade old Linux OS and a bunch of drivers first. Major browser upgrades coming to all cars in a few months. Note, will be slower at first until code is optimized.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sustainableanna @VanSeedBank Similar total size. Maybe slightly bigger to account for a really gamechanging (I think) feature I‚Äôd like to add.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamSamCrompton Sustainable energy production with solar and batteries will grow much faster than auto on a percentage basis. That will be a big focus next year, with primary remaining Model 3 ramp.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MCFlashTube Was gonna say we‚Äôll do all but the last, but that last one sounds like good, cheesy fun :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MadsVeiby Should be in next update<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@moskov Done<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VanSeedBank I promise that we will make a pickup truck right after Model Y. Have had the core design/engineering elements in my mind for almost 5 years. Am dying to build it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeanMahoneyAP Sorry for the delay. We have the most advanced AI neural net of any consumer product by far, so it‚Äôs going through exhaustive testing. The results are blowing me away though and I think you will have a similar experience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wanted again to send a note of deep gratitude to Tesla owners WW for taking a chance on a new company that all experts said would fail.   So much blood, sweat &amp; tears from the Tesla team went into creating cars that you‚Äôd truly love. I hope you do.  How can we improve further?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nicmedia123 We will! At least, whatever is left over after we build the obelisks.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ben_made_new @paulkrugman I would only call someone an idiot if people were mistakenly under the impression that the person was smart<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulkrugman However, public transit is obviously not fully solving the problem, as most major cities have been in traffic hell for decades with no solution in sight. Multi-level tunnels can solve this, but we need much better tunneling technology, as it is currently super slow and expensive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Youri_Hart Major navigation overhaul coming in early 2018. Will be light-years ahead of current system, but we are testing it rigorously before rolling out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulkrugman For the record, I actually love trains, most subways and London buses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulkrugman Idiots can be very dangerous when they seem smart, but aren‚Äôt (having ‚ÄúPhD‚Äù in their bio is a dead giveaway), as some policymakers may get fooled. That‚Äôs what really bothered me about that human cat meme / transit ‚Äúexpert‚Äù.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EcoHeliGuy Rocket was suddenly slammed sideways right before landing. Heavy gust or something malfunctioned onboard. Reviewing telemetry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zerosixbravo @john_gilleran True, but that's a minor factor for rockets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClovenLife No, but shielding got fragged every flight. More control authority is for Falcon Heavy, but also enables Falcon 9 to land in heavier winds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DJSnM They will, but the hydraulic system is closed loop, so no fluid lost. They do need more power &amp; energy, but rocket has plenty of that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zerosixbravo Slightly heavier than shielded aluminum, but more control authority and can be reused indefinitely with no touch ups<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BigDAK54 I spoke directly with The President three weeks ago about Paris. Many others have too. Cautiously optimistic of a positive decision.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WaldekKubicki @shazm01 Interesting idea. Would give a dynamic 360 deg surround view as you're driving. Have this in dev mode. Can be a bit distracting though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sethjacob14 Early next year. To start with, we're making the simplest Model 3 first, like we did with S. Didn't do it with X, because I was an idiot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shazm01 We could add that function pretty easily from a technical standpoint. Just need to add in the billing software.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@douglasprest Can be set higher than that for highways, but limited to +5mph or +8km/h off highway (true avg drive speed) for pedestrian &amp; cyclist safety<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@noradio @MCornell0 @marks22 Exactly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tony_lo Still on for end of year. Just software limited. Any Tesla car with HW2 (all cars built since Oct last year) will be able to do this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@freerobby @jetkohli There's just no way. Hundreds of parts and most of wiring harness would have to be replaced. Would cost more to retrofit than trading in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marks22 HW2. HW1 doesn't have enough sensors and computing power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harropj Hopefully June for those too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MacBenTosh S for sure. It is a bigger car.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jetkohli I'd highly recommend upgrading to latest Model S (which is approx version 4). Only if you really want a smaller sedan, should you get a 3.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheAvinashSingh Maybe I'm misinformed, but I was told that 30% of parts must be locally sourced and the supply doesn't yet exist in India to support that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rrosenbl Yeah, control algorithm is safe, but unpleasant. New one is even safer, but super smooth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ethank Almost there, plus much improved web browser<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kedyson1 That will be tied to deliveries of the first production cars in July<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@akaWrecks @ckalapala Only Model S will have the seven seater option, more cargo space, plus higher range, acceleration, two screens vs one, auto extend handles ‚Ä¶<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CamKode The Model S produced today is arguably version 4. Let me put it this way: it is the car I will keep driving even after Model 3 arrives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlueBowles If fate is on our side, it will be amazing. Will talk about that in detail next week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juanmlemao No problem :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DJBurges Should be summer next year. Sorry, really wish we could get RHD done sooner. We truly are working as fast as we can.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@faultywarrior @matt_trulli @FredericLambert @TimShelton @JimPengelly Let me just go fetch my magic wand ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimShelton @FredericLambert @JimPengelly First in line for dual motor as soon as we can make it, which is probably in 6 to 9 months.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meangene2030 Damn straight we do! Coming with 8.1 next week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>First drive of a release candidate version of Model 3  https://t.co/zcs6j1YRa4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FredericLambert It still has one display<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VoltzCoreAudio Nothing majorly new that a consumer would notice. Lots of new tech in the design and production process though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arctechinc The more autonomous a car is, the less dash info you need. How often do you look at the instrument panel when being driven in a taxi?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@asimo3089 How about the video we just took of the first Model 3 release candidate drive?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trabru Yup, machine arrives next month and we start digging the tunnel!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oakhaller I think so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FredericLambert @JimPengelly No, we are minimizing configuration complexity to keep the production ramp on schedule. RWD only for early production, just like Model S.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trojan81 Tues/Wed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jDaz Because I was a dumb idiot and didn't realize at the time that it would cause confusion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timothymjr Tues/Wed next week<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Skate_a_book Yes. Model S will always be the fastest Tesla until next gen Roadster, which is a few years away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimPengelly Yes, but not until next year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlSaibie Yes. Hardware already on all production S and X cars.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theKen_Miller Sorta. Model 3 is like a BMW 3 series or Audi A4. Model S is like BMW 5 and 6 series, but much faster, more storage space + Autopilot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Greg525 How about now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@varunfatehpuria Oh Model Y is coming too in a few years. Kinda have to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luciojr All Tesla cars built since Oct last year will be capable of self-driving as software improves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@swindeez Definitely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Model 3 was going to be called Model E, for obvious dumb humor reasons, but Ford sued to block it, so now it is S3X. Totally different :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimBeiko Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Model 3 is just a smaller, more affordable version of Model S w less range &amp; power &amp; fewer features. Model S has more advanced technology.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Am noticing that many people think Model 3 is the "next version" of a Tesla, like iPhone 2 vs 3. This is not true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@macwalterslives Looking forward to playing the game with my kids!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@karaswisher Perhaps there will be some future bill that makes a difference for Mars, but this is not it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@karaswisher I am not. This bill changes almost nothing about what NASA is doing. Existing programs stay in place and there is no added funding for Mars.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CapnJesus @Lurpatron @MKBHD @jakerawr 3 is a great car, but definitely Model S<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kyleugh Good point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PriyancaFord I wish. It's so annoying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally, an explanation for daylight savings that makes sense ...  https://t.co/kGpJHNgRJO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndreElijah Ok<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BizbuilderUSA @mcannonbrookes It's been a bear to get done, but prob 10 days or so, depending on full speed autosteer test results<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Legit_bacon @mcannonbrookes Looking forward to it. I know it's cliche, but LotR is my favorite book ever :) Want to see the set and take my kids on tour of greater NZ.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@5AllanLeVito @mcannonbrookes @VGroysman Sure. Just check out my prior tweet on pricing ($250 kWh at pack level). Website will be updated soon, so there is complete transparency.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@mcannonbrookes Can only happen with your support, and working closely with key govt and utility leaders who are strongly committed to trying new approaches<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just wanted to write a note of appreciation to the many Australians who came out in support of the battery plan, especially @mcannonbrookes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ah_pton16 I love Wikipedia. Just gets better over time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JMMZHerrera Answer is complex for electric motors. We use an AC induction motor fed by a DC pack thru an IGBT inverter, which kinda "digitizes" DC power<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@williamwinters High voltage DC is for sure the best way to transmit electricity over long distances. Good explanation at  https://t.co/FOjClHhYiL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ironically, direct current is the right approach today, even though alternating was right in the past. Solar power &amp; electronics both DC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You're most welcome. Very exciting to discuss the future of electricity. Renewables + storage arguably biggest disruption since DC to AC.  https://t.co/7uXoUQf29f<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mcannonbrookes Just spoke with @JayWeatherill, Premier of South Australia. Very impressed. Govt is clearly committed to a smart, quick solution.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shails Yes, but shipping, taxes/tariffs and installation labor vary by country, as those costs are beyond our control<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mcannonbrookes $250/kWh at the pack level for 100MWh+ systems. Tesla is moving to fixed and open pricing and terms for all products.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mcannonbrookes Tesla will get the system installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free. That serious enough for you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zedd Will send you one<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>SpaceX could not do this without NASA. Can't express enough appreciation.  https://t.co/uQpI60zAV7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesatbuzz This is not true. TM works for a lot of people and that's great, but I've maybe done it 7 or 8 times ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fly me to the moon ... Ok  https://t.co/6QT8m5SHwn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SpaceX announcement tomorrow at 1pm PST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MacTechGenius of course<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DueDiamond maybe one of those too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Roller coasters are awesome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnpaulbrewer Something on a tristate border might work. Gigafactory plus nearby supporting supply chain needs a very large workforce.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donbarbieri @GreenCarReports Good chance it will<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidshepardson @BW @ATT @ToysRUs Exactly :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meganmurp @ChrisFaile @BW I didn't pose for it (hopefully that's obvious) or want me on cover. Tunnel boring machine pic wd be way better<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mattnewby no<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Xuan_Thai System was green for launch. I called it off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spacecom They are often right, but, in this case, we have already retired so much R&amp;D risk on Dragon 2, that I feel very confident of 2018.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zperrin99 Uses high pressure bleed off the fuel side (RP-1 kerosene) turbopump, so no dedicated pump or fluid needed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Btw, 99% likely to be fine (closed loop TVC wd overcome error), but that 1% chance isn't worth rolling the dice. Better to wait a day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zybbby Not obviously related to the (very tiny) helium leak, but also not out of the question<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If this is the only issue, flight would be fine, but need to make sure that it isn't symptomatic of a more significant upstream root cause<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All systems go, except the movement trace of an upper stage engine steering hydraulic piston was slightly odd. Standing down to investigate.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@zgiarrizzo Exactly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheLAAdams The laws need to change. Judges are responsible for evaluating whether an action breaks the law, not making law.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dean_arexding There will be a software update this weekend that improves self-calibration ability<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tsrandall 3 months maybe, 6 months definitely<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stephenstohn Yes, safety should improve significantly due to autonomy features, even if regs disallow no driver present<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Auto steer limited to 45 mph on highways for now, i.e. heavy traffic, where it is needed most. Limit will raise as we get more data.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gdoehne @reddit Yes. Block 5 is the final upgrade of the Falcon architecture. Significantly improves performance &amp; ease of reusability. Flies end of year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dtweiseth If we applied resources to doing super complex retrofits, our pace of innovation would drop dramatically<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dtweiseth Tesla will never stop innovating. People are buying the wrong car if they expect this. There will be major revs every 12 to 18 months.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RitaChung16 Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VinnyLingham Unfortunately, that would require stripping down the entire car and replacing 300+ parts. Wish there was an easy way.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gurnam @brianstucki @reddit It is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JRMYGRNBRGR Hopefully, early next week. Results from limited release look good so far. Trying our best to be super careful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trevoclark Good point. 2.34 would be a production Tesla. Stripped down, maybe as low as 2.1.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robsmallshire @ClareMacraeUK It will<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Promising early results from the Ludricrous Easter egg. Looks like 0 to 60 mph in 2.34 sec (Motor Trend spec) might be achievable...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mjreddyMD If the results look good from the latest point release, then we are days away from a release to all HW1 and to all HW2 early next week<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FantaAIex It is extensively tested in the lab and in the Tesla test fleet. However, there is no substitute for real world experience.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Deluded, deranged, etc. Journalistic thesaurus sure got a lot of use last week ...  https://t.co/KFHD1FXvIe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Recode Article is misleading to readers. No one is "taking home" anything. In a stock for stock transaction, nothing comes off the table.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WilliamShatner Of course. Our love will never die.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is going to be great  https://t.co/jnej9HaBef<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatelynBrock Drive units and battery are sealed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If curious abt TSWLM car, am still planning to do a sports sub car that can drive on roads. Just a side project. Limited market potential :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We *def* don't recommended this, but Model S floats well enough to turn it into a boat for short periods of time. Thrust via wheel rotation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tesla owner drives through a flooded tunnel &amp; out the other side   https://t.co/RmPxdZShhq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As mentioned at the beginning of the year, I'm expecting ~70% success rate on landings for the year. 2016 is the year of experimentation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like early liquid oxygen depletion caused engine shutdown just above the deck  https://t.co/Sa6uCkpknY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Turns out the landing was not as fast we thought, but still hard enough to destroy the primary airframe and accordion the engines<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fucktyler Thanks Tyler<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Landing video will be posted when we gain access to cameras on the droneship later today. Maybe hardest impact to date. Droneship still ok.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Upgrades underway to enable rocket to compensate for a thrust shortfall on one of the three landing engines. Probably get there end of year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AstroOrionMK @BadAstronomer Quite rapid... Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>RUD = Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like thrust was low on 1 of 3 landing engines. High g landings v sensitive to all engines operating at max.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ascent phase &amp; satellites look good, but booster rocket had a RUD on droneship<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Highly recommend anything by Sean Carroll  https://t.co/yVbceZm0Io<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanmcarroll Am concerned that advanced life may be inherently unstable. Arguably, any civ capable of extinguishing itself eventually will.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanmcarroll Life you can talk to is another matter, of course. Many, many orders of magnitude less likely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seanmcarroll No way. Look at chemotrophs and extremophiles. Primitive life is bloody everywhere. Highly under the ice on Europa imo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spoite @rsmoz Hence the urgency of making life as we know it multiplanetary as soon as possible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rsmoz That, speed of light constraint and quantum mechanics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And, no, I'm not an alien...but I used to be one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Latest science predicts &gt; trillion alien civilizations. Either they don't last long or there are a *lot* of aliens  https://t.co/oC9B2FlUuF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenjaminRPhoto @StephenPace Yeah, that matches what we've found so far. More likely unhinged than nefarious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Would seem to indicate that one or more people sought to create the false impression of a safety issue where none existed. Q is why?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of greater concern: 37 of 40 suspension complaints to NHTSA were fraudulent, i.e. false location or vehicle identification numbers were used<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NHTSA confirmed today that they found no safety concern with the Model S suspension and have no further need for data from us on this matter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DefTechPat That is correct. It was about innovation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice comment about the Model S by CvK on @TopGear_BBCA  https://t.co/UlEn51onnG<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Fast replay of today's rocket landing on SpaceX droneship OCISLY  https://t.co/I0QQ2D3BtE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dfjsteve Very similar. The crush core in the Falcon legs is reusable after soft landings, but needs to be replaced after hard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crush core is aluminum honeycomb for energy absorption in the telescoping actuator. Easy to replace (if Falcon makes it back to port).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rocket landing speed was close to design max &amp; used up contingency crush core, hence back &amp; forth motion. Prob ok, but some risk of tipping.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Satellite deployed to 91,000 km apogee. All looks good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3 mins to launch  https://t.co/i5jNDs9MCO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpaceX There was a tiny glitch in the motion of an upper stage engine actuator. Probably not a flight risk, but still worth investigating.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jlgolson No prob. We care about doing what's fair &amp; just. Don't always get it right, but intent is always there &amp; we make amends when wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jlgolson Per the letter, Tesla paid $55/hr for *additional* services, so no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jlgolson Yes, but it is false of Merc News to say that Tesla took advantage of low cost labor. We paid $55/hr. That is unequivocal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We still need to make sure that the injured person is taken care of, but less &amp; less of the Merc story appears to be true<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Merc News story about Tesla using $5/hr labor seems to be missing a digit. Tesla actually paid $55/hr.  https://t.co/2dTH0ncdKX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drkevinleung @Tesla_Canada Totally agree. Am told this will be fixed by Thurs, maybe Fri.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshuapinter @juliusvolz Full height of Falcon 9 boost stage on legs is ~165 ft<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Falcon Heavy side boosters can use most of the same airframe as Falcon 9, but center core needs to be buffed up a lot for transfer loads.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@4kpixelsyt yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmustapic yup<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LifeOfRockstar I think so<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hansmikael @TeslaMotors Thank goodness all are ok<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, this was a three engine landing burn, so triple deceleration of last flight. That's important to minimize gravity losses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>May need to increase size of rocket storage hangar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woohoo!!  https://t.co/0P8n8VmFbr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rocket reentry is a lot faster and hotter than last time, so odds of making it are maybe even, but we should learn a lot either way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tesla is increasing the production ramp as fast as possible, but I'd recommend ordering a Model 3 soon if you want 2018 delivery<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@scottymeuk @DericLew @SpaceflightIns @phillipcjackson exactly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_andyoneal sides def, center maybe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CyberdineX naturally<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Falcon Heavy thrust will be 5.1M lbf at liftoff --  twice any rocket currently flying. It's a beast...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>F9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to 1.71M lbf later this year. It is capable of 1.9M lbf in flight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elonmusk F9 LEO payload on capabilities page (correct figure on main page) should be 22,800 kg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lukealization No cross feed. It would help performance, but is not needed for these numbers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lukealization No physical changes to the engine. This thrust increase is based on delta qual tests. It is just tougher than we thought.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elonmusk Max performance numbers are for expendable launches. Subtract 30% to 40% for reusable booster payload.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattyteare Basically current, but higher throttle setting. Good performance of recent launches allows us to reduce 3 sigma reserve margin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just posted latest max payload capabilities of Falcon 9 and Heavy  https://t.co/Z45Y5V7G91<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dannysparker yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@phillipcjackson turns out it doesn't need securing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mini_Elon yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vicentes @gdoehne yes, several times<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jbdeck for sure :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tweetermeyer things like this should be purged shortly<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@VivekMGeorge Zuck doesn't (yet) have a deep tech understanding of AI. I spend hours every week being educated by world's best researchers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gdoehne JCSat is pushing the envelope as a very hot and fast mission, so will land on the droneship. Next land landing in a few months.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrBoylan System scan detected only 0.2% of orders with same email and physical address. Those have been purged.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vigneshraju of course<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maya_kazan Temporary spike in some areas due to X 3rd row seat recall. Should be sorted by June.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrBoylan Duplicates will be cancelled. Max of 2 will be delivered to any one person. Only ~5% of orders are 2, so speculation unlikely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erothenberg Simple answer is that there just aren't many used Teslas available. Demand &gt;&gt; supply.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erothenberg checking into it ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@romn8tr will definitely do so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abraham_cavazos some places are trickier than others, but yes. That's the value of having a PICA-3 heat shield with propulsive landing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cardoso It could land on Venus no problem, but would last maybe a few hours. Tough local environment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But wouldn't recommend transporting astronauts beyond Earth-moon region. Wouldn't be fun for longer journeys. Internal volume ~size of SUV.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dragon 2 is designed to be able to land anywhere in the solar system. Red Dragon Mars mission is the first test flight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KristianNairn A 3 should be workable, but an S or particularly an X would be better<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scottmcnealy That article was incredibly misleading and you should know it. Wager right now that Sun has received far more than Tesla?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GatorWass you can do that now with S and X. Will be same for 3.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_elombardo @rjpryan correct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EduardoForneck hopefully 0.21<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteEhmKay @gerardomarina what's the link to that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tapwin No, but we will need to build a factory in Europe to serve long-term regional demand as Fremont reaches max capacity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mpatfield no problem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CrackedUpCorson Will cover whole country hopefully this year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndersRytter yes, but production AWD will be a lot faster<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexBelohlavek less<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@torvos torque is shifted between front &amp; rear motors every ~.01 secs. Traction control is way better than a normal AWD. Digital vs analog.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And, of course, it will have more cowbells.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Model 3 will be RWD, with dual motor AWD optional. Even RWD will have great traction on ice due to fast torque response of Tesla drivetrain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GolfsHard yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Zooropa88 @TeslaMotors Superchargers and service centers will cover all of Italy later this year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Only_Hawk @MICHAELSD01 @TechGrlTweeter definitely<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@iKrivetko that's not the real steering system<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B_Rans yes. Will easily fit two child seats. Three if you buy slim seats.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HBL_Cosmin Wait until you see the real steering controls and system for the 3. It feels like a spaceship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MICHAELSD01 @TechGrlTweeter Won't happen. Reason initial cars are delivered close to factory is to have rapid turnaround on early issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scottkelley99 Edge and contour refinement are ongoing. Even .1mm matters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_amwolo_ They can. Will be great for road trips and camping<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BValvsRacing It will make sense after part 2 of the Model 3 unveil<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A Model 3 order gives you priority in your geography, so, even tho total count is high, ordering early will make a big difference locally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In general, product comments, suggestions and criticisms are always welcome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RyanCasburn We always try to maximize customer happiness even if that means a revenue shortfall in a quarter. Loyalty begets loyalty.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@squallcraft and a few other things<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Token of appreciation for those who lined up coming via mail. Thought maybe 20-30 people per store would line up, not 800. Gifts on order.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@34thrain Maybe 1/4 to 1/2 of what happened. No one at Tesla thought it would be this high before part 2 of the unveil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will give an update tonight for the 3 day total, then last one on Wed for the full week. All efforts focused on accelerating the ramp.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>253k as of 7am this morning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sundarpichai thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now 232k orders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrahamABlair of course :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano Hi Alyssa, thanks for placing your faith in Tesla. I hope you have a great experience with the car.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Definitely going to need to rethink production planning...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thought it would slow way down today, but Model 3 order count is now at 198k. Recommend ordering soon, as the wait time is growing rapidly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Model 3 orders at 180,000 in 24 hours. Selling price w avg option mix prob $42k, so ~$7.5B in a day. Future of electric cars looking bright!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndiaToday Will include India-wide Supercharger network<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Oatmeal sure!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StartUpRabbi Coming in the mail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redletterdave Hardware in all cars. Autopilot safety features standard. Convenience features optional (like S and X).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drew Just order the SpaceX option package!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thanks for tuning in to the Model 3 unveil Part 1! Part 2 is super next level, but that's for later‚Ä¶<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lukealization yes, will cover whole country<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@preastro yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KentNStephens sure is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@roddrury X and S will also be available<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Adding several more countries to Model 3 order page tonight. Check for details, but will include India, Brazil, SA, SK, NZ, Sing &amp; Ireland.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Model 3 orders, whether in store or online, are limited to two per person<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Online ordering at  https://t.co/46TXqRrsdr will now open at 7:30pm Pacific to ensure no server overload. Presentation still at 8:30.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@haerone From almost anywhere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GiftedDiego Coming soon!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Incredibly inspired by the interest in Model 3. You won't be disappointed. Also, small token of appreciation coming for those who lined up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Model 3 unveil will be webcast live at 8:30pm California time at  https://t.co/46TXqRrsdr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rossbin You will see the car very clearly, but some important elements will be added and some will evolve.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tomorrow is Part 1 of the Model 3 unveil. Part 2, which takes things to another level, will be closer to production.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>SpaceX &amp; Tesla comp is same or better than other companies. Big diff is that we don't outsource manufacturing, retail sales or service.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SpaceX and Tesla rated most meaningful work in high tech. Also, most stressful, but that goes with the territory.   https://t.co/y8s4UdMF5z<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wk057 @TeslaMotors Wasn't done at my request. Good hacking is a gift.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rocket landed hard on the droneship. Didn't expect this one to work (v hot reentry), but next flight has a good chance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Target altitude of 40,600 km achieved. Thanks @SES_Satellites for riding on Falcon 9! Looking forward to future missions.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Pushing launch to Friday due to extreme high altitude wind shear. Hits like a sledgehammer when going up supersonic  https://t.co/Gr8T5upaLd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PernilleT Only heard about it today. Doesn't sound like they are in the right though in their dealings with our subcontractor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpaceX Launch aborted on low thrust alarm. Rising oxygen temps due to hold for boat and helium bubble triggered alarm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpaceX AF has placed launch on hold due to a boat entering the edge of the keep out zone. Scrambling helo to get them to move.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TLKFremont Great leg room for 3rd row, rear visibility better, easy storage of long cargo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@derekslager @skiesforme yes, it actually performed better than other colors on stain tests. Best not to have vented seats w kids though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skiesforme Can't emphasize enough that white is the best interior. Also, pick 6 seats unless you really need 7.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skiesforme @TeslaMotors That said, the white interior is the best. Highly recommend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@skiesforme Heavy use of the white causes splitting. Adding backing material to strengthen. Will be upgraded at no cost.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Model 3 reservations ($1000 down) will be accepted in Tesla stores on March 31 and online April 1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ErikRoesegg good point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Should mention that Tesla Motors itself had nothing to do with the short movie. This was completely independent.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheEconomist Interesting name<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Benzinga I didn't take anyone's car and never would. Car was actually allocated to engineering test (not by me) and inadvertently sold.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My best guess for 2016: ~70% landing success rate (so still a few more RUDs to go), then hopefully improving to ~90% in 2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffBezos @SpaceX Thanks Jeff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Falcon lands on droneship, but the lockout collet doesn't latch on one the four legs, causing it‚Ä¶  https://t.co/DpXsRQWal9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stunt_penguin @LayOn_OverWhale Stage 1 would reach low Earth orbit if not hefting a second stage, but payload would be greatly reduced.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimmyVosika Actually, didn't get environmental approval in time, but it was also good practice for missions where a ship is needed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If speed at stage separation &gt; ~6000 km/hr. With a ship, no need to zero out lateral velocity, so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs. Just not physically possible to return to launch site<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As mentioned before, ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. Altitude &amp; distance don't mean much for orbit. All about speed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mbhnyc steel collet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, at least the pieces were bigger this time! Won't be last RUD, but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing.  https://t.co/w007TccANJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Uncle_Gus probably<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>However, that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok, but a leg lockout didn't latch, so it tipped over after landing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Definitely harder to land on a ship. Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area, that's also translating &amp; rotating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe some debris ingestion. Engine data looks ok. Will borescope tonight. This is one of the outer engines.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Conducted hold-down firing of returned Falcon rocket. Data looks good overall, but engine 9 showed thrust fluctuations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Next launch is a @NASA science mission from VAFB California on Sunday.  https://t.co/vJdkJkZzg1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aiming to launch this weekend and (hopefully) land on our droneship. Ship landings needed for high velocity missions  https://t.co/n6j0mExAqM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sad to hear that David Bowie died. He was amazing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In ~2 years, summon should work anywhere connected by land &amp; not blocked by borders, eg you're in LA and the car is in NY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tap your phone or key and your car will open the garage door, exit, close the door and come to you. Will do same in reverse for unsummon.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Background on the launch  https://t.co/1SkttU684X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Launch &amp; landing can be seen on the  https://t.co/bDd3GxQXMC webcast or in person from Cape Canaveral public causeway at 8:33pm local tmrw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just reviewed mission params w SpaceX team. Monte Carlo runs show tmrw night has a 10% higher chance of a good landing. Punting 24 hrs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Currently looking good for a Sunday night (~8pm local) attempted orbital launch and rocket landing at Cape Canaveral<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meant to reply to this article:  https://t.co/JRvXcTG3el<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This article does not appreciate that Tesla is in California despite taxes net of rebates being higher. Incentives only a partial offset.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Static fire test looks good. Pending data review, will aim to launch Sunday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rounding up to 1 sec for a bit of timing margin. Updating flight computer command sequence ‚Ä¶<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aborted on ignition timing due to slow ground side valve. Adjusting ignition sequence by 0.6 secs for next attempt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>About 2 mins from static fire<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elonmusk holding for issue resolution<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Abort triggered by flight computer on upper stage throttle valve. Adjusting thresholds and restarting count at T-10 mins.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>5 mins from static fire test<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lukealization yes, from 70F to 20 F<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@craigcocca It worked in Texas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaigeANjax -340 F in this case. Deep cryo increases density and amplifies rocket performance. First time anyone has gone this low for O2.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Falcon 9 is vertical on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral. Working towards static fire. Deep cryo liquid oxygen presenting some challenges.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Jeff maybe unaware SpaceX suborbital VTOL flight began 2013. Orbital water landing 2014. Orbital land landing next.  https://t.co/S6WMRnEFY5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffBezos Not quite "rarest". SpaceX Grasshopper rocket did 6 suborbital flights 3 years ago &amp; is still around.  https://t.co/6j9ERKCNZl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TobiasVdb The F9 booster can reach low orbit as a single stage if not carrying the upper stage and a heavy satellite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Getting to space needs ~Mach 3, but GTO orbit requires ~Mach 30. The energy needed is the square, i.e. 9 units for space and 900 for orbit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It is, however, important to clear up the difference between "space" and "orbit", as described well by  https://t.co/7PD42m37fZ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StartupLJackson Yeah and hell yeah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atduarte From anywhere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Should mention that I will be interviewing people personally and Autopilot reports directly to me. This is a super high priority.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GangsOfGtown Given high local demand, a Gigafactory in India would probably make sense in the long term.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@abrax4s Yes, establishing charging and service infrastructure in Mexico now. Official launch in next several months.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@javashri Auto import duties are prohibitively high. Hoping for a special category for EVs. Most of our discussion was about batteries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@roneijlander We just finished building a huge expansion in Tilburg!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These are all things I've said before and are naturally needed to improve in-market affordability, so no real news here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Model 3 is due in ~2 yrs. A China factory for local demand cd be as soon as a year after. A factory in Europe wd happen for same reason.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My comments in China weren't transcribed correctly. Tesla will keep making cars &amp; batteries in CA &amp; NV as far into future as I can imagine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JessicaTetreau important to set AC to not recirc (air exits thru rear) and use the snap in shade, which Tesla service can provide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shanenickerson Amount of change needed is enormous - like a spinal cord transplant. Would cost less and work better with a new car.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ID_AA_Carmack That works for Dragon, but hard to do for something long like Falcon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The flight grid fins look like the ones on this test we did, but larger:  https://t.co/gTaURQQeyx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ID_AA_Carmack No choice. Entry velocity too high for a precision landing with N2 thrusters alone. Must have aero surfaces for pitch trim.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@John_Gardi Using legs as air brakes to drop terminal velocity in half requires slight redesign &amp; more data. Maybe flight 21.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Grid fins are stowed on ascent and then deploy on reentry for "x-wing" style control. Each fin moves independently for pitch/yaw/roll.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Base is 300 ft by 100 ft, with wings that extend width to 170 ft. Will allow refuel &amp; rocket flyback in future.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Would also recommend the Cheese Shop, Spam or Fish License by Monty Python.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hold down voice button &amp; say "Play Amish Paradise by Weird Al Yankovic". Model S can play almost any song via Internet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realbhuwan Don't forget the mystery announcement. Part 5 of the trilogy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is a way for the Tesla Model S to be recharged throughout the country faster than you could fill a gas tank.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HowardReiter Totally agree. Tesla will circle back and do something cool for Roadsters next year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mjasandoval Stay tuned<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just want to say thanks to customers &amp; investors that took a chance on Tesla through the long, dark night. We wouldn't be here without you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@westcoastbill Thanks Bill!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Am a fan of Larry, Sergey &amp; Google in general, but self-driving cars comments to Bloomberg were just off-the-cuff. No big announcement here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tesla priority is electrification of cars, so priority is Model S, Model X, then mass market third gen vehicle &amp; truck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rebel_sal exactly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Creating an autopilot for cars at Tesla is an important, but not yet top priority. Still a few years from production.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DJFrustration Tested it myself this weekend and was working well. Some songs have licensing prohibiting direct request.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone interested in doing ultra hardcore vehicle engineering at Tesla, please apply!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chris Porritt from Aston Martin just joined as head of vehicle engineering at Tesla  http://t.co/MNUIWDxoXt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bdcs Yup, it is super far. Moon is basically in our back yard relative to Mars.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nirdthebird Definitely a lot of potential for geothermal, but depends on well depth. Too expensive in most places.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DetlefKroeze Yeah, that probably makes sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DouglasBullard @teslamotors Most people have never heard of Nikola Tesla. That will hopefully change over time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flyguynscc @teslamotors yes, that has been the goal from the beginning<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Am getting lots of questions about the big Supercharger announcement. Aiming to do that the week after next.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stoneymonster Yes, this does put an indirect floor on resale value. Should help all owners.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@yatpay Side boosters fall short &amp; center core goes too far + Florida is heavily populated. Landing permission tricky :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pataneous We can't formally provide a guarantee w/o restating accounting, but I feel confident about the value anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2552nsf Yeah, that is super tricky. Will have to sacrifice a lot of payload to boost back or land on ocean platform.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rebel_sal Yes, your article (and many others) rightly identified that we made a mistake. New financing is not perfect, but much better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alan_Nestos The legs are nested tight against the body of the rocket in flight, so rotate about 120 degrees to deploy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Nezheim @jbmeicher sure :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@jbmeicher Model S works great in cold. Highest sales/capita are in Norway and we have a ton of customers in Canada.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But when considering savings of gas v electricity, true cost vs gas cars is more like $25k for a v sweet ride<|endoftext|>
