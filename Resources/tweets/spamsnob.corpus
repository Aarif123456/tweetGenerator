<|startoftext|>@domisadog Send nudes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan I do, because gardening is such a force for good. so it is important, and doesn’t take much effort, to take a moment to reflect and ask: ‘is all this talk of walled gardens and heritage an exclusion to participation’?

<|startoftext|>@FairGov I did not say that at all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FairGov I agree the economy is being destroyed. But have no time whatsoever for misinformation and the twisting of truth—-that is dangerous and is happening far, far too much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FairGov Yes, and I have said that they are 100%...but from a sample of 10. Anyone who has done basic maths or physics knows you can’t extrapolate significance from such a small sample, especially when you have data from all t2he other weeks!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FairGov What have I said that is incorrect?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FairGov Im tired. Read the link I sent which explains how it works instead of tying to make it up. 2000 tests. 10 were positive. They retested the individuals in those pools, and they were negative. The others were already negative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FairGov No, all but 10 came back negative the first time and were not retested<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FairGov Yes no COVID cases. 10 false positives. But that is just one week. It says overall false positive, 0.3%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FairGov  https://t.co/JqxiliiCrV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FairGov There were 2000 tests as in pooled testing you combine swabs, reducing the 9000 to 2000 tests. 10 came back positive, which were then false. So yes, 100%, but of only 10,a very small sample. Overall the rate is 0.3%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FinolaMoss From only 10 results. Hardly a bombshell<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@V5M1000 On ten results<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TiceRichard Richard, you know full well there were 10 false positives, and that was just for one week. Overall, the false positive rate is 0.3% why are you spreading fake news and misinformation like this?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SarahRose94713 All 10 of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PHE_London @SadiqKhan @londoncouncils And in the north we just get blamed for using up the tests and shoved into tier 3. This is a disgrace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yeoldelovespre1 Nope, just like facts reported properly. Truth is important<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GhostlyRiderBeo None of this is especially great, is it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DBolt20 @dbongino Lol ok hun<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DBolt20 @dbongino And they still didn’t find 9000 false positives in Cambridge, but instead of admitting that, you’re trying to spin some weird defence.... sad times we live in when people can’t admit they were wrong and defend fake news<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tonyjsargeant Again, we are dealing with such a small sample size here. Not sure why you are so interested in this ratio as well, butknock yourself out with it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dopaminoide @Jevi_Machingan @LydiaMunioz @nightcrawlerspa 0.3% falsos positivos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ANTIMASCARILLA 0.3 falsos positivos<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanielPaulwrig2 @piersmorgan No Daniel, that is not what happened at Cambridge. They found 10 positives which came back to be false after retesting. Not 9000.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stonewoodforge On a single week with just 10 results, hardly groundbreaking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyushJ_1604 @HighWireTalk Why have you posted a random quote without a source with a link to the report, which I have obviously read. I’m interested in facts, not fake news<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DBolt20 @dbongino They found ten false positives. Glad we got there in the end. Definitely not 9000 false positives, though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@poshjonn @WelshGovernment Was do that have to do with the Cambridge testing programme? And the inventor did not say they are useless, that’s just fake news<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GhostlyRiderBeo 2000 tests, 10 (false) positives. Yes, it’s not that hard, is it.....and definitely not 9000 false positives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AyushJ_1604 @HighWireTalk What does this have to do with the original report you posted about<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bear44willis Wrong again. 2000 tests. 10 came back positive. All turned out to be false<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@newtok64 @John_for_hope @Darrenjmoore @jeremy_hume @JamesCleverly No. In that week, when there were only 10 results it was 100. Across the whole year of testing. It is 0.3%.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@shesmegg82 They know exactly how to manipulate you, because all you need to hear is something that resonates with whatever conspiracy theory you are into this week. So they give you. You share it. And then defend it. You literally do their job for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shesmegg82 Hahaha yep exactly, because playing into the hands of Russian propaganda makes you so, so strong....you do know  present themselves as the radical liberals purposefully to trick people like you<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bridgewater_tim There were just 10 results. Why don’t you say that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mscookie1955 @DCClothesline There were just 10 positive results. Why don’t you use this figure?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IndivisibleUnit There were just 10 positive tests, why not give that number instead of the 9000?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brainengineer4 There were 10 positive tests. Why not say that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@A1istair @Londonjenny63 @IAmFrankButcher @jamrock78 @simondolan And yes the tests are unreliable, as are most....and yes the economic cost of lockdown etc will do more damage than the lives it saves....but I don’t like lazy fake news spread across social media as propaganda<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@A1istair @Londonjenny63 @IAmFrankButcher @jamrock78 @simondolan He did not say that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@A1istair @Londonjenny63 @IAmFrankButcher @jamrock78 @simondolan I accept there were 10 false positives, because that is what there were.....you are defending fake news. Again, literally what the nazis did. Well done, bet your kids are proud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@A1istair @Londonjenny63 @IAmFrankButcher @jamrock78 @simondolan And no: people who didn’t challenge and question propaganda and false information allowed the nazis to take control. And here you are literally refusing to accept that you share false information<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@A1istair @Londonjenny63 @IAmFrankButcher @jamrock78 @simondolan See again, why don’t you just admit that you were wrong? Do you agree that 9000 tests were not positive?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@A1istair @Londonjenny63 @IAmFrankButcher @jamrock78 @simondolan And 9000 were not positive as you wrongly state<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jbbuff18 @AldoSterone111 @talkRADIO It states an overall false positive rate of 0.3% in black and white.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@poshjonn @WelshGovernment Neither the inventor or cambridge say/prove that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@A1istair @Londonjenny63 @IAmFrankButcher @jamrock78 @simondolan Nope 10 positives were checked and all found to be wrong<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@darrengrimes_ Lol you been posting about this for 24 hours Darren, wonder why.....don’t like the shambles of negotiation that is going on, so instead going to focus on preserving the word ‘empire’ lol.....right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tonyjsargeant 10 tests came back positive. You cannot conclude that 50 individuals were positive because it was pooled. Just 10 (one in each pool) could have been positive. In the end—none were<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jbbuff18 @AldoSterone111 @talkRADIO Nope, I won’t be having the vaccine. But we don’t need to twist data and facts and make a point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jbbuff18 @AldoSterone111 @talkRADIO I’ve read the actual report darling. Because unlike you, I don’t just forward shit which people have made up on social media<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jbbuff18 @AldoSterone111 @talkRADIO Again, he literally did not say that. Lauritsen said it about the HIV virus and the context is that the PCR does not detect the *free* virus...it detects the genetic sequences of viruses. You might not like that, but that is the point of it. And again, no need to spread fake news<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun How the fuck is this news<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@4theWin17 @lsferguson Nope 10 came back false positive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jbbuff18 @AldoSterone111 @talkRADIO Lol sorry I’ve not finished my phd yet. But in the meantime, I can quote test results accurately and not try to mislead people with this 100% bullshit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@husseybyname Mr Blobby<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CelticNotorious @GaryFlo50906612 Well clearly you do if you have a misleading jpeg of a misquoted source on your phone which you share to try and convince people of something which that quote doesn’t support.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CelticNotorious @GaryFlo50906612 Just because someone puts words into a jpeg, doesn’t mean it is true.  Kart Mullins never said this. It was said by another person about the HIV virus. Again, fake news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CelticNotorious @GaryFlo50906612 That’s a nice quote—-where is it from?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scojw @mark_mclaughlin @mrsopinionated1 @LJNAnalysis @Kirsty49943184 @NicolaSturgeon You did cite a number, 100%. Which is misleading when that only applies to 10 samples. You chose—-either through ignorance or manipulation—-to use that number instead of the more accurate 0.3%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryFlo50906612 Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryFlo50906612 I am saying there were 10 false positives with a rate of 0.3% and not 9000 and 100% as the fake news brigade keep peddling. Facts are important.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kirsty49943184 @scojw @mark_mclaughlin @mrsopinionated1 @LJNAnalysis @NicolaSturgeon So why are so many people going around saying there were 9000 false positives? Because it has been spun by people who want to spread fake news instead of just saying there were 10 false positives.  And all of 0.3% were restested!!! It is all misinformation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryFlo50906612 There were not 9000, there were 10.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VladPutin1 @ClarkeMicah Yes, all ten of them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhyllisQuintan7 Bombshell: there were only 10 results with you 100%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthsCon @nadhimzahawi No they did not. 10 were false positives. Stop spreading fake news<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomwhitehouse3 @BorisJohnson 9000 did not test positive at cambridge. 10 did. Stop spreading fake news<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavGTaylor @EffingPoppins @128beatspm @Matthew53073806 @Anshul__K On 10 samples. Overall....0.3%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scojw @mark_mclaughlin @mrsopinionated1 @LJNAnalysis @Kirsty49943184 @NicolaSturgeon And across the full study, their false positive rate is 0.3%, but you've chose  to use figures from just one week. The point is that spreading misinformation and fake news helps no one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNNPolitics Boo hooo mr trump. I suppose the supreme court is rigged now, too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@voxrox55 @DrBruceScott 100% of 10 cases. Why not just say that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scojw @mark_mclaughlin @mrsopinionated1 @LJNAnalysis @Kirsty49943184 @NicolaSturgeon 100% of.......ten cases......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Victoria_KL_ Absolutely incorrect. They did 2000 tests. 10 were positive. All ten were false positives. Read the report properly next time?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jimashore @BBCNews On....ten results. Do you make absolute statements and decisions on ten results?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ANTIMASCARILLA @DathosBD @WomanInSTEM_ What if 100% were a lie? What if the moon is actually made of cheese. Omg.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DJDeMario1 Yes, on 10 results......do you make categorical decisions on 10 results?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MooniShines @WelshGovernment What has cambridge proved with its 0.3% false positive rate?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jimashore @SkyNewsBreak Again, on 10 tests Jim<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jimashore @itvnews No.......10 of the tests received a false positive. There are 7 billion people in the world, that doesn't change the fact that 2000 tests were conducted in that survey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TruthsCon @NHSSTAFFCOVID19 @MattHancock Well cambridge is reporting a 0.3% false positive rate. ....what should it be?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stewart_1979 @DrHoenderkamp @MattHancock On 10 tests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jbbuff18 @AldoSterone111 @talkRADIO .....on ten tests. Count them on your fingers. 10.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The_RealTruth18 @RichardBurgon 100% on ermmmm.....10 tests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TRILBYS1 Cambridge got that on 10 results. I flip 10 heads in a row, but that doesn't make the chance of getting a head 100%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amyeric90649486 @ClueHeywood @RepAndyBiggsAZ Study is reporting 0.3% false positive. Is that bad?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yeoldelovespre1 False positive on 10. Hardly a bombshell, is it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@opensenseme Bomb: there were only 10 results. 10 whole results<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shesmegg82 @fordnation @TheWECHU @YorkRegionGovt I see you're still at it... why dont you just say they found 10 false positives instead of 100%. I know why, because you want to spin it!!! So much for those facts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vulcanbomber2 On 10 results. Why dont you just say that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rwlehoux On 10 results. Hardly groundbreaking is it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattGubba 100% of ten results. Just 10. Not 9000. Why dont you just say that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tonyjsargeant Cambridge is a reporting a 0.3% false positive rate, what is wrong with that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlackmoreKev @ShaunBaileyUK @MattHancock Well cambridge are only finding 0.3% false positives....that too high for you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Martin4Liberty @DHSCgovuk @MattHancock They showed a 0.3% false positive rate....that too high for you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iop_chris Every single one of the........10 results<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pjtanglewood @BBCWalesNews @BBCWales No, all ten results were found to be false positives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickQuinlan9 @CDCgov No. They did not. 10 tested false positive. Read it properly<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mikeha7 @Elex_Michaelson Cambridge showed that in a sample of, ermmmmm..... 10.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HenryMakow 100%........ of ten.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheWorldIsASta1 Bombshell: 10 false positive. Wow. Huge numbers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LoveFitnesLLC @evanolimits No Emma, that is absolutely not what they had. 10 had false positives. Go and read it properly and stop spreading misinformation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@strangegarden7 10 whole results. 💣 out of the water with this one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jon2775 Yes, all 10 results. What a bombshell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoahJamesBangs Yes, all 10 of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PlanetaSec All 10<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dreamer2661 Yes, all 10 of them, why dont you just say that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomhfh Omg. How dare they....scrap an awards system which disproportionately favours the chumocracy of the middle and upper classes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Phoenix4419 @Robert95907116 @laworfiction There were hardly any restrictions on uni students. They packed the halls to 100% and put them in classrooms<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TiredDad18 @JuliaHB1 But of course if could be replicated.....but its delusional to think it could when there is much more evidence to base your guesswork on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TiredDad18 @JuliaHB1 Lol, you said I am "guessing the sample won't be replicated" by which you mean the sample of 10 which were 100%? I dont need to guess, because there is a much larger data set.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DBolt20 @dbongino So they didn't find 9,000 false positives, then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darrengrimes_ @JuliaHB1 I thought you didn’t like tokenism and identity politics, Darren?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robert95907116 @laworfiction Still not sure what exactly you are trying to prove, other than the fact most of the uni population has already had it and testing and isolating works!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robert95907116 @laworfiction So your point now is there was ENOUGH positive tests?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Robert95907116 @laworfiction Sorry, it’s from 2000 tests. 9000 swabs were combined into the pools. So only 2000 tests were conducted on the pooled sample<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bhafc1995 @jeds0808 @racgemlegolady @knight247 @bbcsoutheast It’s probably still around 40k....for me it’s not the numbers but the cost. We have pushed millions into poverty for generations with the economic damage. That kills people and reduce life expectancy.... so I think that cost massively outweighs what we saved<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bhafc1995 @jeds0808 @racgemlegolady @knight247 @bbcsoutheast Debt not best<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bhafc1995 @jeds0808 @racgemlegolady @knight247 @bbcsoutheast Luckily they are so incompetent that by the time they get round to offering anyone under 40 the vaccine the mess will be even clearer. And the best many billions larger, sadly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 Sorry, Wes Streeting is the reason I won’t be watching. Horrrible little man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bhafc1995 @jeds0808 @racgemlegolady @knight247 @bbcsoutheast I agree. I won’t be having the vaccine. But you accept that 9000 people in Cambridge did not have false positive results?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeds0808 @Bhafc1995 @racgemlegolady @knight247 @bbcsoutheast It’s scary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bhafc1995 @racgemlegolady @knight247 @bbcsoutheast I’m talking this result. And the massive way that people are spreading twisted results about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bhafc1995 @racgemlegolady @knight247 @bbcsoutheast I believe facts. I think the govenment approach is overblown and a shambles,....but that doesn’t mean we have to twist results and facts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shesmegg82 @TheTorontoSun Valid swabs, meaning they submitted a swab, not that they were positive 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bhafc1995 @racgemlegolady @knight247 @bbcsoutheast Because that is literally what happened. 10 of the tests tested positive. They were subsequently false.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Solomon28818513 There is one test per pool, that is how pooled testing works. So there were false positives on ten tests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarolRoche6 So what are the pools then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarolRoche6 That is literally the point of pooled testing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarolRoche6 And one test per pool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shesmegg82 @TheTorontoSun You seem to have decided all the pools were positive before they were tested!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shesmegg82 @TheTorontoSun And there is one test per pool. So the false positive rate relates to those original ten tests. Tell me how you deduce 9000 tested postive? As you allude to in your profile, facts are important<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DelphinePalmow1 On a sample of 10!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ugitsisgv This does not relate to the pooled testing programme. The poooled testing programme for the week you posted about, found 0 positive cases. There were 9 from other symptomatic sources<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shesmegg82 @TheTorontoSun Ten results came back positive, all were retested and turned out to be false. That is literally what it says<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ah yes, when the cases in the North increased, we were BLAMED for taking up all the tests and shoved into tier 3. When it's London the testing red carpet is fucking rolled out. #dailybriefing #london #manchester #COVID19 #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCNews Ah yes, when the cases in the north increased, we were BLAMED for taking up all the tests and shoved into tier 3. When it's london the testing red carpet is fucking rolled out.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BruiseWillies @Hazels_Vibes @impulsivewoman @emmakennytv Yes. 10 tests were positive. they then and only then tested all the individuals in the pools (probably around 50) who all came back negative. But the initial false positive result was only on 10 tests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_PauI__ @JuliaHB1 9000 submitted swabs. 2000 were tested. it really isnt that difficult<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BidwIdn yes, all 10 of them. hardly ground breaking stuff, is it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Javibqbr 10 tests. only 10. not 9000.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TiredDad18 @JuliaHB1 But it isnt the correct ratio to multiply to millions because it is a sample of 10!!!!! That is the entire point. You have the percentage from the larger sample. it is listed there on the same document. it is 0.3%.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LynnPag13705581 @drk2lt @PTBarnu62150331 @JuliaHB1 Twisting numbers and statistics is how you end up with fake news and an ignorant public who don't think. What on earth am I denying?

<|startoftext|>@ChrisMasonViews @petluvers4Trump @BamaJeans24 From 2000 tests, 10 pooled samples came back positive. When they retested the individual, they were false. It doesnt matter how big the uni is....there were just 10 samples. it really is not significant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TiredDad18 @JuliaHB1 That's why you then look at the larger data set and overall findings and not jump conclusions and speculation from a sample size of 10.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iop_chris From a sample size of 10. I can flip 10 heads in a row but that doesn't make the chance of flipping a head 100%. Across the entire run, the false positive rate is 0.3%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bantamsdad @stevenson_les @stokieadam @naomirwolf @FatEmperor @allisonpearson Yes, from 10 samples. 10 is not a statistically significant sample size. I can flip 10 heads in a row but that doesn't mean the chance of flipping a head is 100%<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bbdos87 @GMB It's a sample of 10. Let's not go crazy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_PauI__ @JuliaHB1 The number of swabs that were taken. 5 swabs are then sealed in a back and sent to the lab. The lab then only tests one per back...as they have been pooled. Swabs and tests are  not the same, especially when talking g about PCR rate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pjtanglewood @BBCWalesNews @BBCWales I did thanks Phil. 10 tests came back positive. All individuals in those pools were subsequently tested. All negative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SueC00K It tells you that the sample size was 10. Ten Sue. Count them on your fingers. Overall, false positives come back at 0.3%...that's hardly earth shattering<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RuPaulsDragRace This colour palette is a choice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AuriaZepherine @JaneDryden4 @JuliaHB1 Yes, all 10 of them. When making relative claims like "all" or "100%" you need to be clear about the sample size.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LogoTV @RuPaulsDragRace This colour palette is a choice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@punishedCJW 10 of the tests which were conducted came back positive. For each pool, there is only one test. If positive, then and only then are all individuals tested<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@riseupmelbourne They were not all previously positive at all. This is a pool test. Only 2000 pooled samples were tested. Of those, 10 came back positive. When they subsequently tested all the individuals in the pool (around 50), none were actually positive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charliebowmer @JosephSteyne @TiceRichard You failed maths and never got far enough to take stats, clearly.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Gareth_Jenks23 Yes, but they dont test (as in conduct a test on) all the samples in the pool. They conduct a test on one sample per pool<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@s_meury @EmptyM86 @JuliaHB1 Well so many people seem to have got this so awfully wrong. Funny that. .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkAlanMarks1 This does not say this at all. 10 pooled results were positive. All 10 ended up being false positives<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Any_old_tosh @BrianLenzkes @mattdts Yes, all 10 of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BoerboelBritish Yes all 10 whole results were false positives..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@notwhatyourfor Yes, all 10 results turned out to be false positives. 10!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jo_Milne @davidkurten No they didn't jo. Out of 2000 pooled tests. 10 came back positive. All 10 were false positives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Grem_My_World @jwoodz56 @kevinallin @KungFuMovieGuy Yes. All 10 results were false positives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reload14523749 @LBilderberg By 100% you mean the 10 results which came back positive. 100% of my ears are on the side of my head. I still only have 2.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gareth_Jenks23 10 results turned out to be false positives. Hardly startling numbers we are dealing with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JennieB65680068 @ghook No, 10 results turned out to be false positives.  Hardly ground breaking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pjtanglewood @BBCWalesNews @BBCWales Yes. All 10 results turned out to be false positives. What conclusive evidence this is all a grand hoax.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mart676 Yes all 10 results were false positives. Wow. What conclusive numbers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SmythKratos @DeniseInCanada @denisrancourt Yes, all 10 tests were false positives. Crazy numbers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimeInSpace33 @NC_Governor 10 tests were false positives Ann, calm down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@london_rider @JuliaHB1 I'd stop all the heavy restrictions. I think the economic cost far outweighs and has a larger impact than the deaths we are preventing. And why are we vaccinating 90+ year olds first?! Crazy.....but that doesn't mean you have to exaggerate the number and deal in hyperbole<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaneDryden4 @JuliaHB1 Correction: they ran 2000 tests (in the common English understanding of the term test...ie 2000 things were tested). 10 were positive. All 10 turned out to be false positives. Again, why not just say 10 results turned out to be all false<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaneDryden4 @NaomitimT @JuliaHB1 You still here?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmptyM86 @CSWS14204510 @LwtEmmaBird @JuliaHB1 Yes, and luckily they have been doing this a while. This study currently has the false positive prevalence for pooled testing at 1 in 373 (0.3%)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmptyM86 @CSWS14204510 @LwtEmmaBird @JuliaHB1 It doesn't bother me that 10 positive tests turned out to be false positives, no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaneDryden4 @JuliaHB1 That people read headlines and jump to conclusions without understand the data. At the end of ths day, 10 positive tests turned out to be false positives. That's it. Hardly earth shattering figures<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmptyM86 @CSWS14204510 @LwtEmmaBird @JuliaHB1 I just flipped 10 heads in a row. The chance of me getting a head is not 100%. You need a large sample size to be sure. 10 is not a large sample<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaneDryden4 @JuliaHB1 What are you trying to prove?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmptyM86 @CSWS14204510 @LwtEmmaBird @JuliaHB1 Yes 10 positives turned out to be false positives. Hardly earth shattering numbers is it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmptyM86 @JuliaHB1 No all the people replying saying 9000 were tested need to do that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nigelrudd @wsurfa @LwtEmmaBird @EmptyM86 @JuliaHB1 "0 pools were true positives (ie included at least 1 student confirmed to be positive on individual testing)"  https://t.co/9g4U2T0zcY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaneDryden4 @JuliaHB1 They ran 2000 tests. This really isn't that difficult to understand<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmptyM86 @JuliaHB1 Yes. All 10 of them. So many people are struggling to grasp this though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nigelrudd @wsurfa @LwtEmmaBird @EmptyM86 @JuliaHB1 Those 9 were from a different source. Symptomatic testing. Not the pooled testing (all of which were false It says that later down the page...  https://t.co/nu4kt7VF7h<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mark_mtyler @EmptyM86 @JuliaHB1 Well yes, everything can just be wrong. Great way to do science. May as well just pray to the gods and hope for the best. Fingers crossed!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryTed4 @JuliaHB1 And of those 2000 tests, 10 were positive. Not 9000 tests. Not 100% of 9000. 10 false negatives. Thats it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaneDryden4 @JuliaHB1  https://t.co/JqxiliiCrV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaneDryden4 @JuliaHB1  https://t.co/JqxiliiCrV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaneDryden4 @JuliaHB1 The page you posted lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaneDryden4 @JuliaHB1 Which part of 2000 tests do you not understand? They run one test per pool/house. This is the pooled sample. But it doesn't mean they have tested every person. They literally just test the pooled samples. If and only if this comes back positive, do they actually test individuals  https://t.co/xu22nyLJBR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mark_mtyler @EmptyM86 @JuliaHB1 With a count of 10, in a pooled sample......I can flip 10 heads in a row , it doesn't mean the chance of getting a head is 100%. Ffs people, did no one pay attention in maths class<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LynnBrittney2 @JuliaHB1 10 false positives. This really isn't that difficult<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LwtEmmaBird @CSWS14204510 @EmptyM86 @JuliaHB1 They combine all the samples in a pool. Test that one combined sample. If that comes back positive, they test everyone in that pool to see who has it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LwtEmmaBird @CSWS14204510 @EmptyM86 @JuliaHB1 I am not.  https://t.co/aSbqsH57HR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PTBarnu62150331 @JuliaHB1 I've read it properly, I've also read all the comments saying I'm wrong and that 9,000 were tested. Wonder were they got that idea from....they all read it wrong too? Exactly...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wsurfa @nigelrudd @LwtEmmaBird @EmptyM86 @JuliaHB1 None. That's the point. 10 tests (ie pools) tested positive. All turned out to be false positives once they were tested individually. Hi @JuliaHB1 is this the reaction you wanted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LwtEmmaBird @CSWS14204510 @EmptyM86 @JuliaHB1 2,000 were tested. Happy @JuliaHB1 ....  https://t.co/2sSP9k6EWC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaneDryden4 @JuliaHB1 2000 were tested. Gosh this is tiring. Happy @JuliaHB1 ?  https://t.co/OkCA8IhYuG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryTed4 @JuliaHB1 It quite literally says 2000  https://t.co/qJUAg97jqf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shamelessplanet They are both wrong. Two things can be wrong at the same time. Rules were clear: dont travel if you have symptoms, they both had symptoms. Not playing this nonsense again with ppl who blindly defend like sheep<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LwtEmmaBird @EmptyM86 @JuliaHB1 Can I suggest you also do the same: they test one from each household. 2000. Of which 20 tested positive  later turning out to be false negatives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EmptyM86 @JuliaHB1 She is implying, very clearly, that 9000+ students were tested. They were not....2000 were tested. 10 tested positive. 10 were false positives. That’s what she should have tweeted, instead she hyped it up to stir anger amongst stupid people who can’t understand basic numbers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shamelessplanet If every parents who’s child threw up in the night decided to drive 200 miles around the country, we’d be in constant gridlock. But sure......he was just being a good daddy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 exemplifies how thick this country is. Unable to read simple statistical data but goes and shouts about it on twitter. #COVID #Cambridge #coronavirus #coronavirusuk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 This is also pooled. They test one person in each house (reducing 15,000 students to 2,000 houses). 10 came back as false positive from these 2000. Literally nowhere does this say 9000 were tested or that they came back as false. Stop spreading fake news and misinformation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 That is not what this is saying, you are twisting the narrative. It is showing that no students tested positive and that the 10 out of 2000 who did, were false positives. So this false positive rate you hate  is not 9000 but 10.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 @SkyNews So it is fine to boo at someone making a gesture against racism. Can I boo at someone wearing a poppy next year?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan It is one thing to suggest this shouldn't happen at every match (which I agree with) but when you start claiming it is "political" and "marxist" etc you are just showing your racism and hatred.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tjz1100 @petek_78 @RogTat @JolyonMaugham @Lee_Taylor_69 Ah, so Peter Hain, the same person who started the assumption he is in the top 5000 taxpayers without any evidence also says his tax status will be ‘vetted’, again without any evidence or the possibility of that. What did they do to get him? Call him up? Call up Monaco<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tjz1100 @petek_78 @RogTat @JolyonMaugham @Lee_Taylor_69 You, on the other hand, have imagined up a new tax vetting process in parliament and asserted that because there are 23 races in the calendar, he pays tax in 23 countries....lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tjz1100 @petek_78 @RogTat @JolyonMaugham @Lee_Taylor_69 A commons committee have not ‘vetted his tax status’ at all! Stop making shit up or parroting bullshit you have read on twitter. All I have done is simply point out that he uses a tax haven and for that reason, we have no idea how much tax he pays...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tjz1100 @petek_78 @RogTat @JolyonMaugham @Lee_Taylor_69 You still haven’t provided a single piece of evidence that he pays tax in 23 c0untries. Because he doesn’t. He probably pays tax in a handful. And on most of it he pays zero, because. That. Is. Why. People. Register. Themselves in Monaco<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tjz1100 @petek_78 @RogTat @JolyonMaugham @Lee_Taylor_69 I think Lewis should be knighted; I also think he shouldn’t funnel money through a tax haven....they are not mutually exclusive positions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tjz1100 @petek_78 @RogTat @JolyonMaugham @Lee_Taylor_69 That says absolutely nothing about the number of countries in which he pays tax, nor does it provide evidence he is in top 5,000 tax payers (that is a baseless assumption)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tjz1100 @petek_78 @RogTat @JolyonMaugham @Lee_Taylor_69 How do you know this little gem of a fact as well?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tjz1100 @petek_78 @RogTat @JolyonMaugham @Lee_Taylor_69 You know what I mean. You have nothing to base that claim on other than blind belief. We have no idea how much tax he pays and given that he lives in a tax haven, we many reasons to questions it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tjz1100 @petek_78 @RogTat @JolyonMaugham @Lee_Taylor_69 Define one of the top taxpayers<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tjz1100 @petek_78 @RogTat @JolyonMaugham @Lee_Taylor_69 Oh great, as long as he sold his jet, that excuses diverting income through a tax haven then<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ModernLeftie @JolyonMaugham Please show me the tab in those linked stats which include lewis’ name. They don’t, because this claim is an asummption based on guesstimated earning and conditional on him paying tax on all of that. Given he lives in a tax haven, those are some big assumptions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BDKerpow @JolyonMaugham @Lee_Taylor_69 No it isn’t. Hmrc have never confirmed that, all someone did is look at the headline stats for people his age and guesstimated income and then assume he paid tax on all of that. A lot of assumptions in the, especially for someone using teams of lawyers to exploit tax loo-holes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnM_Nottm @JolyonMaugham @Lee_Taylor_69 Hmrc have not stated that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anonymort @FormerKBT @charliejrome @JolyonMaugham @Lee_Taylor_69 Hmrc have  ever said that. Someone who doesn’t know that 9nce said it and you are now choosing to parrot it without evidence in order to defend someone who funnels his income through a tax haven’t<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@petek_78 @tjz1100 @RogTat @JolyonMaugham @Lee_Taylor_69 And then leased it through a company in Cayman Islands I believed....but you know, he just REALLY LIKES Monaco which is why he has that as his main address. No other reason at all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gothykendoll Pink gin, always knew @ChipShopBird was a classy girl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jaytwo86 @JolyonMaugham And the point of tax havens is that you have no idea what is or is not being funneled through them. They are a disgusting tool of the rich to perpetuate corruption and hoarding of wealth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jaytwo86 @JolyonMaugham Well when you are that rich, you don't need to care about defense funding, medicine, vaccines, education, state aid etc and all that other stuff which countries do I suppose. He should then get a monaco passport if he has no connection to the UK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCPolitics I can’t believe so many people love this guy. He is just a richer, better looking version of Gove: he will literally say anything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jaytwo86 @JolyonMaugham And so the issue is that as a rich person able to live in Monaco with a team of tax lawyers, he can funnel earnings and expenses through Monaco and pay zero tax on them. That isn’t fair<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jaytwo86 @JolyonMaugham The point isn’t that he moved away, but that he’s using a tax haven where no taxes are paid. If he went to Spain, we have a tax arrangement with them, meaning we both benefit and no one is taxed twice. That doesn’t exist in Monaco.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wezzyd @lwolive @chrislowres92 @JolyonMaugham  https://t.co/YBFvErTnaT ok go. Pretty comprehensive a-z there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jaytwo86 @JolyonMaugham In Spain he would pay tax. In Monaco he pays no tax<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wezzyd @lwolive @chrislowres92 @JolyonMaugham He is rich; of course he should pay a lot of tax. The issue is whether he should have the ability to funnel income through schemes in order to avoid tax. Schemes only available to high income people. You think yes, others no. End of story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wezzyd @lwolive @chrislowres92 @JolyonMaugham He funnels costs and earnings through Monaco so he doesn’t have to pay. That’s the point of having a tax haven listed as your primary employment location.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jaytwo86 @JolyonMaugham Except he funnels a lot of his earning from the uk (media, advertisement aka his brand) through Monaco, so he pays nothing on that. There is never a morale argument to using a tax haven, only reason is to avoid taxes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@the_staveros @lwolive @JolyonMaugham What a ridiculous statement. I am in top 50 good looking men in the uk. Prove me wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaddyBriggs @JolyonMaugham In my view and that of many others it is immoral.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wezzyd @lwolive @chrislowres92 @JolyonMaugham You don’t understand how tax havens work, clearly. All non havens have reciprocal tax arrangements between the countries, so the cost is netted off. In Monaco, he simply pays nothing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SanjaySahni @JolyonMaugham @njharrison Not the same as a tax haven<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RogTat @JolyonMaugham @Lee_Taylor_69 But countries which are not a tax havens have reciprocal and fair tax arrangements. Lewis chose to base himself in Monaco to avoid taxes whilst preaching about the environment from his private yet<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HODGSON201 @jixxerjoker Moving house is also another easy solution<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HODGSON201 @jixxerjoker Alternatice: bus, bike, train, tram, feet....or again, just somewhere which isn't a pavement. All practical solutions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ena1m @transportforall @AlansTweets @5_News Yes, bicycles on the pavements are the real problem here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adambutler65 @rob4tk @but_cyclists I'd offer them all the spaces available not blocking a footpath, in addition to the bus, bike and train network. Or they are, of course, free to not move into that area or move elsewhere if ownership of a car is absolutely essential to their sense of self worth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HODGSON201 @jixxerjoker Park elsewhere. Or don't buy a giant vehicle if you cant park it appropriately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dj_zotov @MichalZadrag @but_cyclists The solution is very simple. Ban pavement parking then if a car doesn't fit, don't buy one. Or move. Either way, that's the car owners problem, not the rest of society<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FennieBee @Xhocw @tommwatkinss @Clairesolo @mattscar Great, but you shouldn't expect society to provide you with parking spaces outside every house!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tommwatkinss @Clairesolo @mattscar If they are living in terrace houses with no free space for miles, they will have a regular bus service very close by. It isn't my problem to find these people a place to park<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dontwokemeup @RWiSblog @greenmynedd @ElaineWBailey @trymybest18 @SadiqKhan And where is the outrage at the other countries failing to ‘cooperate’......France, Italy, Poland, Hungary, Greece.... it’s a fucking mess....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NottsSw @ElaineWBailey @SadiqKhan It is basically saying the EU agreement on immigration is wrong....as that states people should seek refuge in the first country they encounter....so yes, very political<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NottsSw @ElaineWBailey @SadiqKhan Stating that by crossing the channel they are fleeing it, when crossing from france, is an extremely charged political point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NottsSw @ElaineWBailey @SadiqKhan A politician chose to tweet about "war and persecution"....he made it political. He could have just said how sad this is....no issue with that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RWiSblog @dontwokemeup @greenmynedd @ElaineWBailey @trymybest18 @SadiqKhan People don't like this, but we need to make a distinction between refugees and immigrants...yes the uk should be taking more refugees...but that doesnt mean the channel should just be an open border.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Strets74 @ElaineWBailey @SadiqKhan No one has to stay anywhere!!!! But the EU has its failed immigration policy and until we leave completely all nations should enact it equally....sadly, France, Poland, Hungary, Greece, Italy etc think they can interpret it as they seem fit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahcam3ron @Chrisle00277910 @ElaineWBailey @SadiqKhan And that is the more worrying issue: that you choose to believe someone isn't real just because they present views which don't align with yours<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahcam3ron @Chrisle00277910 @ElaineWBailey @SadiqKhan And that better country where investment will go: China......and I none of us want that. Again, your ideal money printing tree is based on a 19th century economic and political standing which we no longer have access to<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahcam3ron @Chrisle00277910 @ElaineWBailey @SadiqKhan Print money? No... they can rely on the national bank to underwrite their efforts but we no longer have the security of being a gold standard in a globalised world. We are not at a point of negative rates....the medium term result of which is money flowing into better countries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chrisle00277910 @sarahcam3ron @ElaineWBailey @SadiqKhan Indeed, and the EU's refusal to address this properly and the human rights violations In  hungary was one of the reasoned I voted to leave--there is no point in an imaginary utopia if the reality is hell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SadiqKhan For the record: I identify as a socialist and think society can and should do more to help people. But all nations need to share that responsibility. This is sadly another example of why the EU is a failed enterprise founded on hope, not reality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahcam3ron @Chrisle00277910 @ElaineWBailey @SadiqKhan Life is hard; politics harder. Like or not, our leaders have to make difficult decisions. To do that effectively, they need to separate emotion from policy. Your unbounded utopia doesnt exist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mckwoody @SadiqKhan Oh, and france doesnt appear to be at war with any of its neighbours last time I checked<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mckwoody @SadiqKhan They were not fleeing war and persecution from France. I know that because France is one of the most civilised and welcoming countries in the world, who has signed up to all the EU and UN declarations on human rights<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Strets74 @ElaineWBailey @SadiqKhan No, but under the EU migration policy they SHOULD seek refuge in the first country of the EU and that country has a duty to protect and support them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lord_Sugar Oi you poors cough up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SadiqKhan Sorry Sadiq, but as heartbreaking this is, they were not fleeing war and persecution: they were on French soil, with support, food and security.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andyrandle @GarySambrook89 150 million to management consultants. 5 billion in dodgy ppe deals to mates. 50 billion to middle class earners on furlough. 5 million on subsidised mp meals. Choices. Priorities<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chootchyface @GarySambrook89 Ohhh £400 total per month....don't blow it all at once.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What. The. Fuck. #trump  https://t.co/b40zhBnSJX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atticrahman @brexitparty_uk And the 708 million on overalls even though we only needed 13 million worth. It all fucking stinks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It all stinks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atticrahman @brexitparty_uk Or the 119 million on a marketing campaign, has just been leaked. Priorities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atticrahman @brexitparty_uk Like the 150 million for consultants on top of the 15billion for an outsourced test and trace. It's all about priorities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atticrahman @brexitparty_uk Your image says the same thing!! They have given 60 million to councils.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atticrahman @brexitparty_uk 60 million for all councils to provide front line services and meals vs 150 million on consultant fees to consult<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coffey1_david @brexitparty_uk If Covid makes no difference, why have we just spent 50 billion propping up people's wages 🤔🤔🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chris_Leigh_UK @brexitparty_uk Plenty of check and balances ... what, from the councils, whose budgets have been decimated in the last 10 years and towards whom the Tories have an ideological war to dismantle?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iMultitudes @Luckyxmanda @_thomasbibby @brexitparty_uk So the guy on 50k furloughed sat on the couch for 6 months is a wealth creator hahahahah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iMultitudes @Luckyxmanda @_thomasbibby @brexitparty_uk Whats the difference between a tory government spaffing billions up the wall and a left government doing the same<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iMultitudes @Luckyxmanda @_thomasbibby @brexitparty_uk Yes...that's the point of the state intervening to raise kids out of poverty. To raise them out of poverty. That some parents are shit is not the issue here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EguyGimp @brexitparty_uk They are still in fucking poverty at the end of the day....but I guess that's their fault. Thick children being born into poverty. Losers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bolddigger52 @brexitparty_uk And is 150 billion on furloughed middle class workers 'small state'?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Twobeards3 @brexitparty_uk You clearly don't know how food vouchers work....clue is in the name<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABell2019 @brexitparty_uk The point is our politicians made a choice about where financial support went: they supported middle class workers on furlough, middle class diners on EOTHO and their consultant chums.....but feeding children? Well, that would be SoCiAliSt nonsense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Luckyxmanda @_thomasbibby @iMultitudes @brexitparty_uk Chucking money at things....like the 150 billion on furlough, 20 billion on serco trace and fail, or 150 million on consultants...but we cant feed kids? This is a political CHOICE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bob4745798952 @darrengrimes_ Because it isn't fair that a supermarket can sell clothes even though all other clothes retailers have been forced to close<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LBC Aren't they supposed to be running track n trace with serco?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jojobeebee1 @brexitparty_uk Short term solution to a longterm problem.....like the 150 billion we spent furloughing middle class earners?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MerelyMonty @brexitparty_uk And so we should just leave the kids of said people to fend for themselves? Stupid idiots for being born into poverty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Carti_Mandua @brexitparty_uk 150 billion for middle class people to pay the mortgage. Hungry kids....nothing... oh, but here, fight over 60 million<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lostmylist @brexitparty_uk Furloughing workers is unsustainable, and yet we've spent billions paying people's mortgages...but we cant feed kids. Sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrsC_46 @brexitparty_uk They also subsidised their own MP meals by 10 million a year. It is about priorities<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@latimeralder @TruthSeekerTKS For the record: the economic damage doesnt justify the action we have taken, but misleading cherry picked stats doesnt help anyone in the long run<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@latimeralder @TruthSeekerTKS 4. Also a subjective statement supported by a meaningless graph. Total beds is misleading as you can't put a covid patient in every single bed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@latimeralder @TruthSeekerTKS 3. That's a subjective statement....meaningless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@latimeralder @TruthSeekerTKS 1 and 2: So, given only 5% have had it, this equates to 800,000 dead if the whole population gets it. You happy with that level of death?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tampax @gobeeharris Post identity politics is a scary place..We've reached a stage where people get so angry about how other people define themselves. Isn't that sad? That people will put aside human beings in favour of identity. Crazy. Sad.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@geordiegraeme81 @PlanitIE And what goes in those big white areas which were earmarked for retail and public space in the masterplan only approved in January?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChronicOldham More worryingly: the land they plan to sell off was not earmarked as such in their strategic masterplan (only signed off in jan, after negotiations were already happening)...what was the point in that massive consultation if you secretly plan to do something different<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only Oldham council could announce they have bought a shopping centre in the middle of a pandemic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Coco31974967 @OldhamCouncil Only Oldham council could announce they are purchasing a shopping centre on the day of lockdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeaversFactory @BillRegenda @OldhamCouncil @greatermcr @oldhament_trust Said a property developer...land sold off cheap for them to build crap houses<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OldhamCouncil Those big white squares.....land you are going to sell off on the cheap<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Coco31974967 @shawrhinos @ChronicOldham @OldhamCouncil Money is coming from a government PWLB loan. Of course, none of the financial coatings are public...but some on the council exec have a good track record of allowing projects to fail then get promoted to another council<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OldhamCouncil Who the fuck buys a shopping centre in the middle of a pandemic......oh, Oldham Council.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OldhamCouncil So those big white squares next to the new park is land you plan to sell off on the cheap to your corrupt counsillors property companies?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarenProcter8 @AMeek13 @lottielawlor @lisanandy And liverpool got 40 + 15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AMeek13 @KarenProcter8 @lottielawlor @lisanandy And Lancashire and liverpool, both half the size, received 40 million ON TOP of the extra for track and trace....if you are going to defend this, at least present the full facts. So proportionately, manchester should have received 70-80 on top of the track and trace support<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@grayphil27 @LianneFallon4 @ColinJMorgan @Scugnizzo60 @MalHay @JuliaHB1 That's very colourful but shows you absolutely nothing about the comparative scale of this, which was the original statement I took issue with...anyway, tired of this nonsense. Good night<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grayphil27 @LianneFallon4 @ColinJMorgan @Scugnizzo60 @MalHay @JuliaHB1 Lies, lies and damned statistics.....the numbers  can always fit the narrative you want to present. But at the end of the day, there will still be an awful lot of dead people....which people seem ok with. Great.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grayphil27 @LianneFallon4 @ColinJMorgan @Scugnizzo60 @MalHay @JuliaHB1 Indeed. So it is at least twice as deadly for those under 40 and then incredibly more deadly after that. Again, extrapolate that out to 7 billion people and you have an awful lot of dead people...in their 50s, 60s...and yes 70s and 80s.  https://t.co/EqLpKx4PzF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@grayphil27 @LianneFallon4 @ColinJMorgan @Scugnizzo60 @MalHay @JuliaHB1 And the comparable figure for flu under 70?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoEazyAnswers @Cairocobra @Arron_banks When they choose to find space for a cricketer and the PMs brother instead of the second highest church official of the land, I consider that an erosion of our culture and wellbeing as a society...and something worth complaining about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cairocobra @NoEazyAnswers @Arron_banks You’re not getting this are you....it’s not about whether people are deserving, it’s about the fact they broke precedent and said it was full whilst simultaneously putting in Tom, dick and Harry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LianneFallon4 @ColinJMorgan @Scugnizzo60 @MalHay @JuliaHB1 5 times higher isn’t ‘similar’ when you are dealing with 7 billion people (&lt;0.1 for flu compared to 0.5) I think we have exaggerated the risk....but it is very important that we dont just throw around stats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 But it’s true though Julia. If Europe had just stayed in their countries instead of iINSISTING on foreign holidays, this could have been under control...but no......got to have 2 weeks in Benidorm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cairocobra @NoEazyAnswers @Arron_banks But Ian botham and Boris’ brother.....THAT is cronyism, not keeping the second highest member of the Christian church in the lords<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Fraud. We see you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>‘Don’t be afraid’ says the man given drugs literally nobody else has access to. Who had access to daily testing (and a helicopter) no one else can. And who had round the clock staff. Yes, Trump might not need to be afraid, but say that to the 200,000 dead. #TrumpCovid19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You were given drugs literally nobody else has access to. You had daily testing no one else can access. And you had round the clock staff. Yes, you have no reason to be afraid, but that’s not the same for joe bloggs.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Strange how all those people who are saying what a great country Poland is look similar to those complaining about the Polish immigrants 😆😆<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@frasermackie4 @JamesMelville And 80,000 a year, plus travel, plus expenses, is an awful lot to pay for a mediocre citizens advice service<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesMelville @frasermackie4 Absolutely not. We want people who have done stuff to come into parliament, not one track politicos who come in and then get lucrative consulting positions. Tighten up the information sharing and that will stop this dirge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rerickre @JuliaHB1 Incorrect. Only when used by officials in a public capacity is it is a public forum, even from personal accounts. Eg trump tweeting from his personal account. In all other cases it is a private forum.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 And twitter has a right to decide the kind of words and tone that it allows on its platform. Good on them for taking a clear stand, unlike Facebook.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is surreal. He is clearly no longer in charge of his twitter, he is still in the air...but looks good! Very strange #TrumpCovid #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why didn't they let this go out live? Clearly worried something might go wrong #TrumpCovid #trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He walks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Carefully choreographed walk...the delay was so they could ensure all the cameras were in place. #TrumpCovid #PrayForTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darrengrimes_ Ohhh 5 times in 7 months.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wellseewellsee @tamf_ @johncusack Indeed. Supreme court would have to weigh in on a number of matters: voting slips, the electoral college etc. It may have to anyway. Delay would be the easiest way out?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He actually waited until the markets closed before being moved, didn't he. #TrumpCovid #trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robertshrimsley @WritesBright He is going on a ventilator<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed: Ventilator<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surely the only benefit in this case to being moved to a hospital is close access to large equipment. Trump is being put on a ventilator #TrumpCovid #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maitlis Yeah I love a good hospital office set up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the positive side, WiFi is shit in hospitals, so Trump won’t be tweeting for a while<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IRONSal1 @Centrefuter @alexhrbfc @tomhfh Happy to chat on phone of you want to explore political commonalities, of which we probably have many, DM me...but tired of twitter nonsense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IRONSal1 @Centrefuter @alexhrbfc @tomhfh Oh ffs get a life mate. I did. My friends hate me for it. Do i give a fuck no......because i know that most people who voted for brexit are actually just normal ppl not entrenched in the nasty left -right rhetoric going on...a lot of left voted to leave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IRONSal1 @alexhrbfc @tomhfh Btw. Im also a self employed consultant, doesnt mean i have clearance to review all of our top security instituions as he is....ohhhhhh, but Dom is just an innocent ordinary man. Get real<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Centrefuter @IRONSal1 @alexhrbfc @tomhfh And also: two ppl, from different parties, can be in the wrong...sick of this childish attitude where ppl try to play ppl off each other....he said, she said. Grow the fck up and take accountability and call out shit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Centrefuter @IRONSal1 @alexhrbfc @tomhfh I voted for brexit and think he is a fucking tool, like most people do. Grow a pair and stop retreating into the safe place where everything is left vs right. He has done more damage than anyone. The public is stupid and needs clesr guidance and trust. He shattered that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spunknuggets Poppers?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Centrefuter @IRONSal1 @alexhrbfc @tomhfh No he gets heat because he drove 300 miles in the middle of lockdown when we were all told to only go out for essentials and exercise.

<|startoftext|>@1624_of @TurraloonNS @DrDublin1 @toryboypierce @jeremycorbyn Me too..and face the consequences like a man.

<|startoftext|>@1624_of @TurraloonNS @DrDublin1 @toryboypierce @jeremycorbyn No one is defending Corbyn, mate...he's a tool for that, and even more so for allowing a picture.

<|startoftext|>@MerrettCarolin1 @darrengrimes_ I think most sensible people can see their hypocricy, what I question is whether that is really worth the endless media attention when, eg, the leader of the free world still hasnt come clear on whether he paid any tax in the last 10 years<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rossettimay @darrengrimes_ We do know for a fact that trump is the first president in half a century not to release his taxes....that would clear it up!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jimbodragclown @ritabagaz This tweet aged well😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeValkar @SteveParker1971 @tomhfh But there is inaccuracies and then a 10%+ (or nearly a whole grade) difference from previous years (which is what teachers assessed at)....that isn't fair on the kids who had a strict assessment vs a more Liberal one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveParker1971 @MikeValkar @tomhfh I think the broad approach was suitable, what they should have done is an extra standardisation to take away the discrepancy of much higher private school grades and low SES....but that's what the equalities what EHRC will look at!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is this bad: the influence of RPDR feeds into local scenes and will eventually  change what drag is about at every level. And that is sad, because there should be space for the quirky in drag #DragRace #CanadasDragRace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which is why artists like Jimbo are constantly put down, because they bring the other elements to everything they do. But as the franchise gets bigger, we see the emphasis on fashion-over-everything-else get worse...see the recent seasons and winners 2/  https://t.co/0BVpQweK1o<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The problem with #dragrace: fashion has always been a part of drag, but alongside camp, irony, dark humour, illusion, comedy, dance and performance. But Drag Race emphasises fashion over all of these #CanadasDragRace 1/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GraphiqueJack @banksvillanelle Yesss exactly! And it annoys me because with every season and put down like this they are erasing this aspect from drag...and that's sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomhfh But again, if you look at the full data, richer pupils had their A/A* grades pulled down by a higher amount and yet private schools still received a higher bump that public schools.....pulling apart data like this is so much fun, isn't it....can reach any conclusion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveParker1971 @tomhfh We definitely shouldn't take teacher grades...cant have a cohort with 30% higher grades than other years. Would also have caused chaos for uni admissions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was one fucked up episode. No wonder Jimbo and Bobo are getting angry when week after week the judges undermine and belittle them. #CanadasDragRace  https://t.co/wSKEtLhBFy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveParker1971 @tomhfh Yes but what people are trying to do is find differences between SES or type of school to justify their agenda....and with data like this, you will always be able to find something to fir your narrative<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@darrengrimes_ And if 500k die, clogging up hospitals so that another 500k die because they can’t get treatment...is that ok? Am I supposed to accept this risk to me because some arrogant 50+ yo think they are not more at risk?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Metro_Ents What a waste of oxygen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MirrorCeleb What a pathetic creature<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MirrorCeleb This is all so staged it is sad. I bet her ankles aren't broken and it's part of this wild holiday narrative the media are feeding into. I feel sorry for the kids<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MirrorCeleb You have literally posted 4 or 5 nonsense articles about her today... who is she shagging to get this free publicity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSunShowbiz No. No they do now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IrishSunOnline Why on earth do you continue to give this lowlife free publicity. Shes got a phone....Great!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyMailUK Its a sad world when "son pushed mum in chair" is the headline and not: unfit mother leaves her disabled son at home after her 6th pet just died due to negligence. ...oh but what a lovely pink top<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TopInventor @TheSun 6 dead pets and a disabled kid left back in the UK. But she gets so much fucking press coverage painting her as a Saint.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fabulousmag How's her 6th dead pet doing....or the disabled son she left back in the UK after he just got out of hospital. Oh but what a nice pink top.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MirrorCeleb Why do all you papers constantly promote this vile creature who left her disabled child at home and whose dog recently died through neglect<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSunShowbiz Another promotion for the women who left her disabled child at home to go on holiday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun Another promotion for the mother who left her disabled kid at home when he just got out of hospital...to go on holiday and post pics like this of her other kid....oh and remember the dog that died through her neglect?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSun You mean her disabled kid who just got out of hospital but who she left at home??? Honestly, does she pay you to promote her like this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexillest @bitchonarrival Alex, that's offensive and ableist and laughing erases the voices of the victims don't you know 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bitsofpeach @Brianmur000 @ZaneComarmond @bitchonarrival But who are you to police what drag is....just because you like seeing pretty make up and fashion doesnt mean you know what drag is, about or tries to achieve by pushing boundaries...you watch a TV show, thats it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bitchonarrival So fucking sick of all the stupid children moaning how 'offensive' this is and how THEIR VOICE matters. Well I got some news children: it doesn't. The world is messy and complicated....just like drag.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Pepsi_noodle @katyasbabyhand @CrystalMethyd Given how super important it is that nobody ever doesn't anything which could possibly hurt someone's feelings whether intended or not, I'm surprised the twitter hate directed at Crystal isn't calling for the complete dismantling of the canada drag race franchise.

<|startoftext|>@gigiszamo @CrystalMethyd Yes...and jeffrey...and the production....and Brooke Lynn presumably for being a part of this<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@petiteodr @CrystalMethyd You must have some REALLY strong opinions about this week's episode of Canada's drag race...shit, so many people must need to apologise<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Marley20231 @ThreeWordsWork @chandaclondon @Telegraph And Cummings little eye test in Barnard Castle or the announcement of a local lockdown via twitter or Handjob's incoherent TV appearances have absolutely nothing to do with problems understanding the guidance 🤔🤔🤔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheQueenVic94 @pixel_punkz @SoniaPoulton Look im going to mute you because you are annoying. You asked about rhetoric, I demonstrated her underhand use of stats to bolster her arguement... im not interested in your argument<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ceidwadol @TheQueenVic94 @pixel_punkz @SoniaPoulton Hahah yeah right....no group of people have ever been persecuted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheQueenVic94 @pixel_punkz @SoniaPoulton I'm trying to demonstrate the use of rhetoric and argument, which you asked about. ..but something isn't getting through<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheQueenVic94 @pixel_punkz @SoniaPoulton I literally did not say that. Because this data does not tell us that. Just as it does not tell us whether trans people (regardless of your opinions about them) pose any more or less of a threat.....again, rhetoric<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ceidwadol @TheQueenVic94 @pixel_punkz @SoniaPoulton #allchromosomesmatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheQueenVic94 @pixel_punkz @SoniaPoulton Maybe we should put all dogs to sleep because some pitbulls are dangerous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheQueenVic94 @pixel_punkz @SoniaPoulton See here is the problem...you asked about use of rhetoric, but are so entrenched in your own opinion that you can't listen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheQueenVic94 @pixel_punkz @SoniaPoulton I don't know...thats the point....its disingenuous use of facts....aka rhetoric<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheQueenVic94 @pixel_punkz @SoniaPoulton Again.... that has nothing to do with trans people. To genuine, she should post figures about the danger that trans people pose....but she isn't being genuine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheQueenVic94 @pixel_punkz @SoniaPoulton And those stats aren't even male on female!!!! All attacks. Again, rhetoric....selective use of facts to bolster her argument<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheQueenVic94 @pixel_punkz @SoniaPoulton A male, maybe. Not a trans person though. Those stats have nothing to do with trans people....but by inserting them in her argument, she pretends they do. And that is rhetoric. And she knows what she is doing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheQueenVic94 @pixel_punkz @SoniaPoulton What does that have to do with trans people?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheQueenVic94 @pixel_punkz @SoniaPoulton  https://t.co/hmqWcONr7L<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheQueenVic94 @pixel_punkz @SoniaPoulton Using statsitics about all violence against women in an argument about trans people implies (wrongly) that trans people are dangerous....that is some fucked up rhetoric for you<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@michael_looker @leoniedelt @chatwithkatblog Because this isn't really about her disability but about her  believing masks are not useful/beneficial/ infringing on her civil freedoms. And pretending this is something to do with being exempt on medical grounds is actually deeply offensive to people actually in this position<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@saltyfetus @leoniedelt @chatwithkatblog Hahaha love it. Exactly. Pick and choose and make a huge song and dance about it....then go silent when get called out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrinityTheTuck @jansportnyc Just said this! Stopping at the neck would have emphasised the effect instead of blending into the drss...which just makes us think...why doesn't it continue to the arm....but I love jimbo (and you!)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jansportnyc @jimbodragclown So...i actually think it would have looked better stopping at the neck instead of going down to the dress line. That separates the face and emphasises the effect. A period wig was needed to. That said, the dress was miles ahead of the rest and I adore Jimbo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@King_Lovatic It seems like once again they are trying to find fault with the older/weirder/bigger [delete as appropriate] girl. But Jimbo is already a legend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@erickurzeda @King_Lovatic And Priyanka's makeup? And poorly constructed dress?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@motherhyolyn Let's call out what is happening: Jimbo is older but serving LOOK AFTER LOOK, and that doesn't fit with the RPDR narrative of young, skinny and 'fashion'. So sadly, I suspect she will get chopped at the first opportunity....even though she is clearly the best there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zigazighmmm Hahah!!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@daryl1932 @politicalite See this is your problem.... wanting to make everything left vs right, white vs black...that isnt how the world works<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrFlibbleRules @Skyseller67 @FraserNelson Well equititable system would move, to ensure wealth is distributed. We have to start by determining the level of inequality we are happy with, though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FraserNelson strange article....its reasoning was that there are all of these loopholes which exist but are complicated, but the article which arrived at the 20pc figure didnt factor in recent developments. In the end, though, I dont think 20-30pc is an unreasonable estimate?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomhfh @JuliaHB1 What rights does Julia think are going to be taken away exactly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GuidoFawkes Lol funny how the people commenting passionately seem to have no idea how our political system works (which has been exported to almost every developed country in the world)....just bbc bias and communist party comments!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Schwaglads Stop trying to whip everything up into a nasty divisive frenzy. It really, really isnt necessary...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Schwaglads Fast moving situation. People living their lives. Yet the brown girl gets the right wing hatred... yes. That's what I got<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Schwaglads Dan Hughes was tweeting about the 2 m rule at the exact same time...10pm... where is the outrage that he wasnt diligently following twitter and conveying thoughts and prayers  https://t.co/LotS7cAA2I<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bob_london Nope  https://t.co/RTqPBW7n1T<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeremyCymru What is your point dude. You do know that two things can be simultaneously bad....it isnt a world cup, we dont have to rank everyhting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EVOORGi @FoxxysTweets Yes. Thay is literally the definition of terrorism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@santookas No, that is the LA bomber from years ago  https://t.co/Y49qHHCrEX<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SuisseIl What on earth does this have to do with the terrorist attack<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FoxxysTweets No, it's a horrendous terrorist incident and will always be that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bluecitizens @chxrns Cats kill birds. And birds get killed flying into airplane engines. Therefore, cats can fly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kolliderskope @chxrns Who you asking..  I dont. And most people dont<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlokeWorking @chxrns No. And...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Titter_user @chxrns Yes   ......but not in this case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArtwithKrissy @StNJosie And this shouldn't have been filmed either!!! Two things can be wrong. We dont have to play everything off against each other<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KushK93 @RitaPanahi But it is important to keep it in context and not whip up division and create unnecessary divides. Most british people are actually very reasonable and dont identify with either extreme side<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pirata_perla @RitaPanahi So the 5 million people who have immigrated in the last 10 years (or so) are all potential terrorists? I'm going to assume you dont think this  but then the question is how you balance the actions of the few against the rights of the many...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Veganon4 @BreitbartLondon @BreitbartNews You literally posted a meme dude. Then an insult. Woof.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frosty_0811 @BrianoNazereth @DawkinsReturns I know my agenda mate: small effective government, equitable distribution of taxes, transformative education programme....urs?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SurvivalInstin8 @iso_mum I am not BLM at all. And condemn most of what has been done in their name. But hate this divisive approach where we seek to rationalise horrible videos because of entrenched political divides. We are better than that. We dont need to do thst<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KushK93 @RitaPanahi "People"? You do know there are 65 million in the uk....so best not to get annoyed about what a few hundred think, I have found<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@willix2121 @RitaPanahi @ezralevant So you think WHAT happened exactly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pirata_perla @RitaPanahi What were those, exactly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@petitejean1 @RitaPanahi @pritipatel I hope boris johnson hasn't given birth to 8 illegal immegrants now seeking asylum... I mean, he could....so it could be teu<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@D_MUR72 @DawkinsReturns Cool story bro...the relevance to the three people killed inge park being...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TopTradersADVFN @DawkinsReturns Blm should 'take responsibility' for a terrorist attack conducted by someone else?!?!? Who exactly would you like to go in front of the podium and 'take responsibility' for this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@norniron77 @DawkinsReturns @razorsharpe09 That's be a great idea. Why dont you try to help organise?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AHickinbotham @DawkinsReturns Well either he is or he isnt. Thats how terrorism work. And it will become clear. It doesnt work by you offering up your suggestions via twitter what his intentions are though. Literally. That isnt how terrorism works<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xJUSTBELIEVE So you have other intelligence them that you have obviously shared with the intelligence agencies....or just gone onto Twitter to spaff your nonsense up the wall?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thinredline101 No...hours after. In a park. People sat with a picnic. Terror attack<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@solar_ape @politicalite Yes and...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Meddoo881 @politicalite It was stabbings in a field with random people sitting. Thay make their deaths any better<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frosty_0811 @BrianoNazereth @DawkinsReturns Well no...the 40 million eligible voters fuckeed up, and primarily those tory voters who have put into office the most incompetent government we have seen in a century<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArtwithKrissy @StNJosie No they wouldn't. End of. Absolutely not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamuelM35427190 @colesypontyboy @OnePoliceUK So why are you making this into a divisive issue. Can you not see that be playing the 'them and us' game you perpetuate the problem?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Veganon4 @BreitbartLondon @BreitbartNews Stunning and brave. I provide an explanation; you a meme. (That was a semicolon btw, in case you need to look it up)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ericthe08378950 @StNJosie Well great.... and I'm sure the family of the victims are loving it tonigt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frosty_0811 @BrianoNazereth @DawkinsReturns Labour 2017 because I wanted to contribute to the alternative, but couldn't bring myself at the last...dont believe inspoiling the balllot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ibroxorgolf @DavidHadley1973 @DawkinsReturns Great...I'd love to see that written up as an immigration policy. Everyone kept in a cell for 2 months while backgrounds checks are run. No exceptions I assume, either<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Veganon4 @BreitbartLondon @BreitbartNews We have to find consensus... have to. AND....simultaneously condemn these atrocious acts. We can do both. But we have to do both...we cant be so divided in our thinking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Veganon4 @BreitbartLondon @BreitbartNews No. Look I want stricter border controls and limits on immigration. I think some minory members of BLm are going too far. But when people have been killed, and theirs families potentially dont event know yet, I find your flipancy of "peaceful stabbing" very very disturbing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boriderecha @iso_mum 4 cops killing a guy vs terrorists attack with blood everywhere before the family was informed. Glad you think these comparable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LionRich4 @iso_mum "No blacks have been killed by whites".....would love to see that spreadsheet of data dude....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SurvivalInstin8 @iso_mum Bit of a different when 4 officers who are supposed to keep us safe are killing a man vs this... but sure jan, sure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fawkes_14 @iso_mum They didnt film the person. They filmed the people trying to help. As they bravely stood behind  their phone...adding filters to say 'this is real'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CountDooku66 @iso_mum No, let's blame everyone and take collective blame. And then try to overcome it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deephouse44 @iso_mum They were not filming the criminal bit the people bleeding and dying on the ground<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BullshM @StNJosie Difference being in that case, 4 cops ...with guns...were doing the killing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ericthe08378950 @StNJosie No it isn't<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheKnightsTemp5 @StNJosie Difference being there were 4 cops DOING the the killing in one, all with guns, and 4 cops trying to help in the other. But yeah. Otherwise identical<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArtwithKrissy @StNJosie Real journalists dont submit video showing people covered in blood and release these to the world before the families have been told. It's clear krissy that you dont know a journalist who as been in a war zone...but it isnt about whipping out a phone and absolving responsibility<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jools_Orca @StNJosie There were 4 police men there, with guns, you idiot. And people tried to plead with them... about hard when THEY HAVE GUNS and again THERE WERE 4 OF THEM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonsmagic @StNJosie Ffs.... so we have to rank all indecent encounters and be sure to post all to twitter before commenting...get a grip<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GhostLabour What's your point you sicko. People are dead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PamL_54 @OnePoliceUK @Phoebejoy1611 You do know that the people using that acronym represent a tiny minority of the public. Probably 0.001%. The rest are incredibly proud of the peopm who protect us<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@colesypontyboy @OnePoliceUK People are dead. People with families....and this is what you think?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joshika01 @OnePoliceUK How many BRITISH? WE HAVE 65,000,000 so be good to keep things in perspective right<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TactfullyI @timebomb81 @xuriousmusic Dude.... people have fucking died tonight......get a grip<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thelasthope210 @Ph7Danny @DawkinsReturns Yes exactly...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kneelforgod @BreitbartLondon @BreitbartNews These are peoples families. You dont know what they were doing. They could have just been sat in the park. And are now dead. This is a horribly insensitive tweet and I hope you reconsider it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kimkimmersjojo @BreitbartLondon @BreitbartNews I can almost see the smirk on tour face as three people are DEAD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@snowflakemelte @BreitbartLondon People are dead you dixkhead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jason17111231 @BreitbartLondon These people are dead. Neither me or you know who they are, but they are real people with families who will be mourning tonight. This is a very very sad tweet and you should consider whether it what you want to convey to the world<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Veganon4 @BreitbartLondon @BreitbartNews People are dead too sicko<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TactfullyI @timebomb81 @xuriousmusic What is your point mate....spill it out...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@UK_Sonny @deadpanmatt @DefundBBC Again. That does not make it better. Paedophiles could use that very same excuse...so that makes it ok???!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UK_Sonny @robmcd85 @DefundBBC That. Doesnt. Make. It. Right.....ffs do people have no morale compass anymore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UK_Sonny Should not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UK_Sonny And you should perpetrate this video. These are members of peoples families. Take it down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TactfullyI @timebomb81 @xuriousmusic And you know they are BLM supporting because you conducted a thorough interview. Just help me clarify the timeline: that was after he stabbed the people and before the police intervened? Right place  right time!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KaiAsher1312 You could win Eurovision with that look!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thatonequeen Bob stop it, too funny. I love you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's an idea: there are twats on every side of the political spectrum, and their actions should be equally condemned. Why do people struggle to understand two things can be equally bad #blm #londonriots<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MalcolmConkers @athingy1 @SadiqKhan @metpoliceuk That's a picture from the student tuition protests 10 years ago. But yes, if I were in charge, all students would be doing a year of community service to learn respect before going to uni<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Markl208 @GuidoFawkes Who are they? I was though. Both disgusting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Minutemen1776 @GuidoFawkes Still offensive though, isnt it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Markl208 @GuidoFawkes Well that's because they weren't. Because this is from the student tuition protests 10 years ago<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeaSharker @GuidoFawkes It wont go to court, he will get a fine. Still pretty disresepctful, though--right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CamembertMark @GuidoFawkes The man handed himself in. Were they supposed to turn him away and tell him to come back once they had dealt with their other priorities<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@milzeemiller @mickyhew @pritipatel @metpoliceuk They literally mention that he turned himself in in the third sentence of the article<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ormie1 @JackJamesRyan_ @Sacha_Lord @JamieMoore777 They are all bad. Multiple things can be bad. It isnt a competition<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_tannerscpo @Ed74663303 @MetPoliceEvents @BasJavidMPS Still disrespectful and should be acknowledged as such. Imagine how his family feels seeing all these people making excuses.

<|startoftext|>@DRoberts44 @SooksThe @SadiqKhan @metpoliceuk The act was disrespectful, regardless of intent of angle of his dick or direction of the flow of piss as it trickled over the spot the dead officer lay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheHangedMan18 @DRoberts44 @SooksThe @SadiqKhan @metpoliceuk So what he did was fine and wasnt disrespectful to the memory of the dead officer who died in that spot defending the country from a terrorist attack<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DRoberts44 @SooksThe @SadiqKhan @metpoliceuk Great so we agree. Disrespectful and shameful....you just cant quite bring yourself to say that for some reason.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@marlonxcaliber @adamboultonSKY Yes. Both are bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DRoberts44 @SooksThe @SadiqKhan @metpoliceuk I would suggest that you stop being an apologist for something which is clearly offensive and hurtful. None of us know the intent, but trying to portray this as him being "discreet" is just disgusting and shameful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@walter_arther @FrankBukowski1 @pritipatel @metpoliceuk And I'm sure the dead PC Palmers wife feels just the same<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DaraSquires Her one "self-described" trans friend that is!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>JK Rowling et al are the reason why queer spaces and groups have always welcomed and stood by our trans friends. More than ever, this month needs to be for you. We got your back.

<|startoftext|>One "self-described" trans women, in fact. Classic microaggresion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I gave JK Rowling the benefit of the doubt and read her essay, because I thought it would be reasoned and thoughtful. Nope. What a nasty, belittling and dismissive piece of writing this is. #translivesmatter #istandwithjkr #PrideMonth  https://t.co/pKoHpJ6rDo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a sad, sad conclusion to reach JK Rowling. This is not what it is about at all. #TransWomenareWomen #istandwithjkr  https://t.co/rIPg7cUUIr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's OK trans people, JK Rowling also knows one whole trans person, so this clearly gives her authority to use her privileged position to shit all over you. #istandwithjkr  https://t.co/Ae07nNcTpj<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It gets worse......books and music got her through. FFS  https://t.co/e7Wq1DuaLU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fucking hell it gets worse... "I too might have tried to transition," JK Rowling says, but "it had to be books and music that got me through". WTF. Maybe a long bath or carrot cleanse could have cured you too. #IstandwithJKR  https://t.co/AaQb3RUkBf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VerdiMurray Well I'm just at the part where she casually dismisses what is a difficult decision and process for people, diminishing and belittling it.  https://t.co/NQzkPvgaKl<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>JK Rowling letter is so self-centered. I went in with an open mind, but it is literally about how good she is, how many charities she has, how much of a victim she is. Sad. #istandwithjkr<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Of fuck, please tell me this doesn't mean Dominic Raab is in charge? #boris #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>12% of critical care beds are full with #coronavirus. Given numbers are doubling every 3 days, that means capacity will be reached in 9 days. And people are still not taking this seriously #lockdownUKnow #COVIDー19 #StayAtHome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it is time for another queen to step up and create an alternative #DragRace that isn't all about "fashion" or that is transphobic, racist or condones abusers. #DragRace12 #RockMSakura #justice4ROCK #rockforseason13 #drag<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JUSTICEFORSAKURA #justice4rock @RuPaul needs tot get out a bit more and see what drag is about these days....not all about fashion. Rock was so much fun<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Poor @RockMSakura, @RuPaulsDragRace needs to get its head out of 'fashion' ... that isn't all that #drag is about. You killed it girl. #DragRace #DragRace12<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Neighbours can see you are vulnerable and rob you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do not do this. #letterboxlifeline #coronavirus #COVID19 #panicshopping  https://t.co/Dc43KJ9DvY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We can't #closeschoolsuk because we have pushed everyone into precarious, low-paid employment and so couldn't afford childcare.  #coronavirus #covidー19uk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Herd immunity is NOT part of the plan. Wait....I. thought. Just. Last. Week... #herdimmunity #coronavirus #COVIDー19  https://t.co/ErurOCzZin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Because this...mass graves being built in #iran. The government wants to hide this....everything is normal!!!  https://t.co/MdYYBOaKNF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is what #coronavirus looks like. Mass graves being built in #iran. @guardian is running this story (from @nytimes) but doesn't put the pic on its page...because the reality is scary. 95% are fine, but millions will end up in a pile like this. #CoronavirusPandemic #COVID19  https://t.co/lMgS9WSe0u<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today the government has shown what it really cares about: it does not want an economic downturn on their watch. And the thousands will just have to die for it. This is about economics #CoronavirusPandemic #CoronaOutbreak #COVID2019 #cobrameeting #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>46 countries have now closed their schools due to the coronavirus.  UK . . . . . . . .  #CoronaOutbreak #coronavirus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone:  Italy: closes the country. Ireland: closes all schools. China: quarantines cities . . UK: advises over 70s not to go on cruises  #CobraMeeting #coronavirus #CoronaVirusUpdate #Covid_19 #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, the @Conservatives may get the House of Commons down to 600 members after all...but not how they planned. #ThoughtsAndPrayers #prayformps #cornoravirusuk #coronavirus #tories #Parliament #COVID19 #NadineDorries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Businesses who are waiting for the government to issue social distancing measures before issuing work from home orders are forgetting their social responsibility. And are stuck in the past. Step up, lead, and value your staff #coronavirusuk #coronavirus #coronavirusuk #business<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Presumably, @NadineDorries hadn't traveled to Italy or had been in direct contact, or else she would be self-isolsting. So, how/why was she tested for #COVID2019uk #coronavirus when the rest of the public are left in the dark.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Question is.... why was @NadineDorries tested for #coronavirus whilst others are refused a test unless they have travelled or been in direct contact?#nadinedorries<|endoftext|>
