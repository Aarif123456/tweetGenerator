<|startoftext|>@dawnabel @RubinReport Ind small business is hard for gov’t to control ie Costco can pay $15/20 hr local grocery can’t, empl become dependent on Costco local grocery closes. Gov’t can control lg Corp Eventually we all consume from the same spout. Homogenization of America<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@William91548226 @JoeBiden Policy speaks louder than words. Higher taxes, $15 min wage, government regulations means small business can’t survive. If you can’t understand that, I suggest you talk to some small business owners.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden You are setting up a system where only large corporations can survive. Starbucks, walmart etc pay $15 minimum wage, hire tax Atty to find tax loopholes even in higher brackets. Independent local business can not. You are homogenizing America, killing  our uniqueness &amp; indivuality<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AutismSyrup @thehill By paying taxes on our Income then also paying sales tax and personal property tax etc we are being taxed multiple times on the same earnings. It is criminal. Flat tax will Eliminate loopholes, eliminate irs, eliminate long form complicated tax forms<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AutismSyrup @thehill Regressive tax isn’t income tax it’s based on property, consumables and sales all of which IMHO is theft but we are still paying along with progressive taxation. So I don’t understand your argument. Flat tax on income is still better for all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill Don’t fall for America! What he isn’t telling is LOOPHOLES still exist so the very wealthy (Amazon) will pay little to no tax while Repealing tax cuts will increase taxes for lower income. SOLUTION: 8% FLAT TAX! Now ask why politicians and big business are against it 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Finding effective treatments; pursuing a vaccine; NOT living in fear, all things #Trump is doing. What different would you do? The truth is, NOTHING. But you and your handlers don’t care, just get elected and blame previous admin I.e. The Obama Method<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Simple question , HOW?  Just tell me what your plan is an perhaps win my vote?

Answer please!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EthanSerechen @MattWalshBlog would you feel the same about a Jewish candidate?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EthanSerechen @MattWalshBlog you are just casting stones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffAllenComedy @EthanSerechen @MattWalshBlog abortion should not be publicly funded,but murder is between God, vic &amp; perp-not our call<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EthanSerechen @MattWalshBlog @JeffAllenComedy I don't believe Christians should question faith based on political opinion. WWJD? Shame?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JeffAllenComedy @MattWalshBlog unfortunately, history has made the case time and again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattWalshBlog @JeffAllenComedy what a self-righteous, ugly, horrible thing to say and sadly what a Christian thing to say as well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HillaryClinton  100% agree BUT NO tax dollars should fund it. Forcing those who are morally opposed to pay via tax=unconstitutional<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FreedomWorks @pye @Forbes @ForbesOpinion every candidate themselves or their donors has profited from #eminentdomain esp #oilforcruz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glennbeck way to a mans death as excuse to bash Trump. Obsessed much?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedState so far still Cruz, but this GOP/media eating of their own making me sick. This article is propaganda only.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FreedomWorks @pye @Forbes @ForbesOpinion #EminentDomain will be relied upon when #keystone goes through. Cruz supporters oil to make $$$$$$<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tedcruz house is still there. Big oil, you and your cronies Mr. Cruz will make billions using #eminentdomain if we get #keystone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HillaryClinton @GKButterfield enforce laws we already have and self employment/small business NOT gov't can provide jobs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Oil_Ranger @DRUDGE_REPORT could not agree more<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DRUDGE_REPORT I'm a flat tax gal which puts me firmly in Teds camp, but stuff like this makes it hard for me to keep pulling for him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DRUDGE_REPORT 😄peters 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theblaze hmm, the Christian values should thank God for safe landing and safety of all but take a look at comments so sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@resurgent @tedcruz  so that nullifies what you did to Carson? #pot-kettle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimfromPA @WorldOfStu @glennbeck you're right, my bad lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimfromPA @WorldOfStu agreed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WorldOfStu you mean beautiful women can't make their own decisions? I'm sure many were looking to advance their own careers. Pers choice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WorldOfStu not the first man purchase a trophy. Just look at Washington, Hollywood, and spots wives.  Kucinich anyone?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WorldOfStu common business mantra. Personally goal oriented is i portent to me as it is any successful person<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WorldOfStu as your attempt here has been proving<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WorldOfStu I guess inconstancy is what you are going for but I prefer context.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WorldOfStu as an aggressive woman I agree with this statement we are no longer in the corners, not a bad trait in the business world<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WorldOfStu unfortunately a common opinion among successful men (and some women) but not unique to Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WorldOfStu as a woman, I agree<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WorldOfStu rather have someone say I'm filthy rich and proud of it as a millionaire who puts on jeans and work boots and says I'm like you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WorldOfStu  I like this quote and agree with it 100%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WorldOfStu and yet they do. Ho hum.....next....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WorldOfStu gotta say, these quotes are pushing me toward the trump camp.prefer a flawed man to a false messiah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN as well he should<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theblaze and if not "bible minded" then what? Worthless idiot? Maybe should have your head removed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Roofner97 @WorldOfStu happy you enjoyed. I support Cruz for flat tax not biblical knowledge, hence my original tweet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Roofner97 @WorldOfStu going nowhere. Tell yourself you schooled me and I am afraid of you, I'm ok with that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Roofner97 @WorldOfStu the same feeling I have for radical Islam- believe or you are worthless. I am done with this conversation it is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Roofner97 @WorldOfStu which is why I support Cruz. But this when I hear you have no opinion if you can't quote scripture is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Roofner97 @WorldOfStu to my original point, I don't want a pres who can quote scripture, I want one who can quote constitution,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Roofner97 @WorldOfStu last tweet a reference to "more on" trivia. WWJD?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Roofner97 @WorldOfStu it is not Christ like to say if you don't believe as I do you are an idiot (or work at a c-store)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Roofner97 @WorldOfStu if you were paying attention I said I am a Cruz supporter, I was placing dual criticism at both men's feet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Roofner97 @WorldOfStu I don't need to prove my faith. Forcing a national religion is not constitutional<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Roofner97 @WorldOfStu I'm saying from politicians to showmen they say what ever will get them votes or $$. I want a constitutional leader<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Roofner97 @WorldOfStu only God knows what's in a mans heart. Mr. Beck may be fooling you for profit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WorldOfStu common quote among candidates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WorldOfStu mm nothing wrong with this quote. We need a pres not a preacher. Still for Cruz but Glenn's spin is starting to sour me<|endoftext|>
