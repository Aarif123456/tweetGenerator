You have the most White Supremacist, xenophobic, homophobic, Nazi wannabe, racist, fascist support. Enjoy!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@fuzzychimpcom @TVietor08 @daveweigel @splcenter Your guy was the “birther” conspiracy King, created the Muslim ban, ripped children from their parents, kept them in cages, and lost 535+ children’s parents....but his “Lock her up, lock him up, Fire Fauci” screaming supporters are the best of America? God, I hope not!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fuzzychimpcom @TVietor08 @daveweigel @splcenter Unlike Trump who NEVER turned down but encouraged White Supremacists support..... Biden did not, has not and will not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fuzzychimpcom @TVietor08 @daveweigel @splcenter After the drone strike that killed Iranian general Qassem Soleimani, Spencer withdrew his support for Trump.

<|startoftext|>@fuzzychimpcom @TVietor08 @daveweigel @splcenter You mean the one that replicated the “Nazi” march of the 30’s all dressed in Trumps golf uniform? All those Trump supporting Nazi’s? The one you claim don’t exist?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SaveZPlanet @ParkerMolloy @MuellerSheWrote No one is pretending the GOP is controlled by evil .... we know it! They show us who they are.

<|startoftext|>@steveglenrogers @Santaniego @erinemaxwell @shelbygrad @Latmes Not in the way that you are insinuating....there us no fraud.

<|startoftext|>@steveglenrogers @Santaniego @erinemaxwell @shelbygrad @Latmes And I have lived in OC for 56 years and 31 in my current home. I have watched it change every time I vote.

<|startoftext|>@Santaniego @steveglenrogers @erinemaxwell @shelbygrad @Latmes My area voted blue as well. Ballot harvesting is the myth/lie Republicans tell each other to cover for their losses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steveglenrogers @Santaniego @erinemaxwell @shelbygrad @Latmes You are a liar. Ballot harvesting is a myth. I have voted in every election here for more than 40 years.

<|startoftext|>@Divinity11 @KarenLynne2828 Exactly. It’s Zuckerberg that has allowed this to happen. Too many political lies from Fools and Russians  spread to too many of my friends. When people you have known, loved and respected for years start arguing with you ON YOUR PAGE with bogus memes.....it’s not worth it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KarenLynne2828 @Divinity11 I am deleting mine today. It’s so filled with hate I can’t stand it. Plus FB knows everything I do. I downloaded an app that has no connection to FB &amp; it showed up on my activity. I am done. Copied my account &amp; have all my pictures,etc now. It’s time for me to break away for good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Divinity11 @KarenLynne2828 I left FB after 2016. I came here to Twitter so I can vent to people I don’t know. I hated knowing about family and friends that support Trump OR Bernie. I consider twitter my place to vent to strangers to help me stay sane. I want 2020 to go well so I can go back to being nice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Divinity11 @KarenLynne2828 I actually used to be a nice person before 2016. I have always been active in politics and was active on FB. The hate that came out after Obama was elected was disgusting. I worked hard but nicely against it but the Berners used the same tactics on FB against Hillary....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarenLynne2828 @Divinity11 When Hillary was in the a Senate she worked across the aisle to pass legislation. We could have had comprehensive immigration reform then but Sanders fought it. It was bi-partisan &amp; Bush supported it. Another Sanders purity test that kept us from going forward-that’s NOT progress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Divinity11 @KarenLynne2828 That’s what #Berners and #MAGAts have in common... #Cult45 and #CultBernie both believe in #AlternativeFacts<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ms_Breuer @Tamaraciocci @DirkSchwenk @Kanew Candidates register by party. Bernie always registers in Senate primaries as a Democrat to keep other Democrats from winning.

<|startoftext|>@justinxcopp @kenvogel @neeratanden @HillaryClinton @faiz @thinkprogress And you said .... “ I mean, I knew you were willing to threaten with violence, but I would not have guessed that you and your friends threaten people with rape. Bizarre.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justinxcopp @kenvogel @neeratanden @HillaryClinton @faiz @thinkprogress OMG I said 2005 by mistake. It’s 2019 &amp; @kenvogel is using “2008” event to discredit Neera &amp; garner support 4 Bernie.  Darn, I didn’t explain myself to your satisfaction. Frustrated beyond belief &amp; not handling it well so my one shitty “push” tweet I suppose will now define me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justinxcopp @kenvogel @neeratanden @HillaryClinton @faiz @thinkprogress You said after that ...we threatened people with violence. Not what I said. Please reread<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@justinxcopp @kenvogel @neeratanden @HillaryClinton @faiz @thinkprogress Well can’t tell you now. @kenvogal blocked me. Will have to find his story again from another source<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justinxcopp @kenvogel @neeratanden @HillaryClinton @faiz @thinkprogress Are you kidding ....or did you just make a mistake in your reply? We were threatened. My comment from yesterday was the first I have said anything to anyone about any physical contact. Meant to outline the Push vs Hit argument even acknowledging neither are good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Noorangeppl @kenvogel @neeratanden @HillaryClinton @faiz @thinkprogress How about #BernieCult members threatening me with violence, called a c**t, told I should be raped for supporting Hillary. How about press never #VettingBernie but the cult lying about #Hillary was OK. He was asked repeatedly to stop his supporters. He did NOTHING!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justinxcopp @kenvogel @neeratanden @HillaryClinton @faiz @thinkprogress My point, PUSH vs HIT. My anger over this hit piece by @kenvogel got the best of me. Maybe he would like to interview me &amp; friends who were threatening with violence, rape etc for supporting Hillary not Bernie. How about #VettingBernie this time instead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justinxcopp @kenvogel @neeratanden @HillaryClinton @faiz @thinkprogress In @Kenvogel attempted take down report on Neera the incident with reporter now working for Sanders happened in 2005.  She “pushed” him in the chest after he went back on interview agreement. Sanders sent letter trying to get her terminated or discredited from CAP think tank.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samstein @GideonResnick Works for me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justinxcopp @Chris_Stover65 @kenvogel @neeratanden @HillaryClinton @faiz @thinkprogress There was an agreement before the interview in 2005 that the reporter violated. Was Neera angry...yes. Did Neera overreact...yes. She says “pushed” He says “hit” He said/She said. Still wrong. But let’s try and destroy Neera NOW because Bernie can’t stand criticism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justinxcopp @kenvogel @neeratanden @HillaryClinton @faiz @thinkprogress Love the press....hate the hypocrisy of THIS report by THIS journalist due to THIS  letter from Sanders.

<|startoftext|>@Chris_Stover65 @justinxcopp @kenvogel @neeratanden @HillaryClinton @faiz @thinkprogress I get your point. Not sorry I said it. Sick of attacks against Hillary supporters.

<|startoftext|>@BeerdedMECH @yadifan04 @GrahamAllen_1 Wrong again. In fact, they wanted America to support Freedom for ALL religion as well as Freedom FROM religion. Many of their ancestors came here to escape religious persecution. Christianity is not under attack. Religious hypocrisy is being called out. Not the same thing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PaceofHeaven @RanaAurora Main stream media did report it but how would you know. The man is a local, known to law enforcement and The Mall because of previous problems. He is mentally ill. This is a extremely horrible story but not because of the lies you want to promote.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RickCrainium @mack_sailor It’s a news report from 2016 being used by #FakeChristians like you now that Norte Dame is burning because it suits your message of hate....how very #Christian of you #FakeNews #Liar #StopSpreadingHate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rpcvbg @Plantflowes @briebriejoy He still needs to be vetted. Something that didn’t happen in 2016 #VetBernieNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@red_garyl @Tristanshouts @briebriejoy 🥀🥀🥀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cajsa @Caerage I am also a survivor &amp; for me this is not the same. I see a huge difference between sexual, demanding or agressive touching vs big hearted affection. Intent matters. @LucyFlores intent is suspect. We just need to agree to disagree &amp; as survivors not take sides against each other<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dax_x98 Daily ....multiple times<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This sums it up perfectly. Thank you @frodofied #StillWithHer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ambeanie_moss I was 10 when JFK was asassinated. After that I always watched news with my parents &amp; asked questions. Volunteer for RFK in HS. My boyfriend was at the Biltmore Hotel when he was assassinated. Civil Rights, ERA, then Reagan 🤮. I never stopped being passionate &amp; engaged.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THIS is a major shot of TRUTH and awesomeness #TruthTequila @MSNBC @CNNPolitics @NBCNews @ABC @CBSNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Up4Yes @ThinSkinTrump @CillizzaCNN What exactly did he say that was untrue?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@warrior_4_good @ShelbyKStewart @NicoleWallace please share this with your guests today. So disappointed in those ladies who I love and respect. #Biden is a National Treasure. This is #HerEmails all over again. @LucyFlores should be vetted for her @BernieSanders support. And #VETBernie while you are at it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Champthinks2 @amvetsupport They are “willfully ignorant” There are sources for the above Trump issues and they CHOOSE not to seek them out. There is no such things as #AlternativeFacts #FactsMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>💩 for brains<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now THIS is creepy 🥀🥀🥀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes...you did<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy Birthday @tedlieu 🎉🎂🎉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daveconte1971 @BernieSanders I agree. Seems like the Sanders campaign fears a potential Biden run. Also if you look at pictures of her that day with her hands on Biden and also pics of Bernie with his hands on her....give me a break! It’s political.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marion_daniels @ClarenceMack3 @peterdaou @LucyFlores He knew...did nothing! He is complicit. But maybe he can write you a nice little “rape fantasy” story.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JRubinBlogger Can you please check into his record on homelessness &amp; poverty? Seeing reports I don’t like and reading from some South Benders that bring up these points. As far as I can tell no news organization or journalist I recognize are investigating. I want everyone vetted on all issues<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoshthePagan @magi_jay @PaladinCornelia Hillary has always been a leader and dedicated to America. Your Bernie has consistently NOT voted for things that move us forward. He vacillates between not perfect and not in his best interest for his voting decisions on gun rights, immigration, woman’s heath &amp; safety, etc🥀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@magi_jay @21law Same here as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottPresler Yet she supports a man @BernieSanders who actually had sexual harassers on his staff, knew about it. and did nothing. #HypocriteMuch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MPSeale @jacobpounders @JuddLegum Understood. Hard to reason with people who have 💩 for brains. Just wanted to point to the 🐮💩 and then move on so it’s not standing out there unchallenged. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kimberl00987980 @PeteButtigieg I have been listening to people who are actually from South Bend who have a different opinion. I was asking @PeteButtigieg to respond. I didn’t ask you anything. I want to know about what I heard of homelessness, fines to poor homeowners driving many out of their homes from him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kimberl00987980 @PeteButtigieg Have been....which is why I asked. I would like to hear his responses to questions being asked. His response would help me understand these reports. Are the true? Are they smears? Or something in between?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteButtigieg Could you please explain your policies against the poor in South Bend? I’d like to know how forcing poor people out of their homes is good policy?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TrumpsTime1 @amypenprase @johnlegend @FoxNews Actually, I want women to be able to decide for themselves what happens to their body. It’s between her, her family and her doctor. Not some ProBirth advocate like you who doesn’t give a damn about the child once it’s born.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@therealblazeone @stylesffx @jfreewright I suggest you check your facts. Before 2009 when the US Military started paying the NFL for doing Patriotic Displays at games the teams stayed in the locker room. Before 2009, if players wanted to go on the field for anthem they could. It’s a recruiting device. NFL makes 💰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stylesffx @jfreewright Also, during the anthem ceremony most times a huge flag is unfurled- horizontally. This is against the rules for the flag. The only time the flag should be horizontal to the ground is when draped over a soldiers casket.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TayfunDurmusTD @spectatorindex No, or hopefully not. Reports are they choose places to do everything they could to keep that from happening.
