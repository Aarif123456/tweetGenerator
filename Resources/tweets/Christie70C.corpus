<|startoftext|>Everone must call because it was evident from the press conference that they have NO intention of charging the four officers. It’s all lip service just to keep people from rioting again. #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRevAl Why can’t they at least charge these officers NOW?! #GeorgeFloydWasMurdered<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoryxKenshin Watching the #GeorgeFloydWasMurdered presser right now I, and I think they’re all full of shit. It’s just lip service. The ONLY thing they should say is that the officers involved are being charged with murder!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BrendieVance @ddale8 Birx is another Ditsy DeVoss. Trump surrounded himself with clueless sycophants and this is what we get.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What can we expect from the #WorstPresidentInHistory ?  It was too predictable that he would be a total failure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A sociopathic narcissistic egomaniac like @realDonaldTrump !<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@amyklobuchar @JoeBiden I want Amy for VP!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Uh oh, sounds like the supreme narcissist @realDonaldTrump is envious of Dr. Fauci. Watch out Fauci--you may have become one of his sycophants recently but he will not stand for anyone but himself having the spotlight.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Acyn Hannity's fake reporting is criminal. He should be sued for any deaths that are a result of his audience believing him over the doctors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joncoopertweets I caught a glimpse of Dr. Fauci cowering at a presser with DT when a reporter quoted something he had said to the press last week. He then went up to the podium with Trump standing next to him and walked back what he has said. I haven't trusted him since.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@washingtonpost @realDonaldTrump hasn't learned anything. He has a closed mindset, he's a narcissist, and a grifter. He isn't suddenly going to have an open mind and be open to self-reflection at 70 some years old. #trumpvirus #TrumpRecession #TrumpResignNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AhmedBaba_ Yes. It's time for Sanders to concede.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump It’s not hidden. Most of us were paying attention to what was happening in China back in January, but you were too busy ignoring it or trying to cover it up because you fired the people who could have prevented this. #TrumpVirus #TrumpRecession #TrumpResignNow<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CNN No way did he take the test! He doesn’t even know what it is!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CNN #WhereAreTheTestKits They have been promising test kits for four weeks!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@brianstelter Yeah, I want to know who the fools are who haven’t been listening to ALL the doctors tell us this is just the beginning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@washingtonpost Is it the same “doctor” who gave him his physical the first year he was our FAKE president. That was full of lies and hyperbole, so why should we believe anything now? He makes people lie for him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DevinNunes @joelpollak If he hadn't committed so many impeachable acts, they wouldn't have had to impeach him.

<|startoftext|>@mdnij34 YES! Like everything else, he tried to cover it up and now it's too late to stop it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump LOL--We're still waiting for him to "meet the moment." He looked and sounded like the incompetent loser that he is at the Rose Garden what-ever-that-was today. He's just a lying, blowhard, conman. P.S. Stop trying to tell people what they should see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jefftimmer No difference. I call him Pinhead Pence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyceWhiteVance The 80% of us who think Waiting till November to get rid of this dangerously incompetent president are not going to accept a postponement of the election. I predict riots and chaos across the country. Is that what you want @SenateGOP and @HouseGOP ?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ImpeachmentHour I call him the FAKE president. The Meuller report proved he cheated his way into office with the help of a foreign adversary. He doesn’t deserve the respect that a person who won honestly should get.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree! If the GOP weren’t so corrupt and actually cared about this country, they would have booted Trump’s fat ass as soon as it was obvious he cheated to get elected.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is scary!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MysterySolvent I wasn’t worried about the Ebola virus because I knew our president had qualified and competent people making sure we would be okay.

<|startoftext|>Agree! Biden is the most presidential!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@morethanmySLE @amyklobuchar She’s right! I don’t want to see them fighting each other. I want them to talk about all the awful things Criminal Trump has done that they will fix. #DemDebate2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Yeah, why should we pay our taxes if he won’t even make his public?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcorubio But we don’t have “real capitalism.” The wealthiest people in this country got a tax break while the rest of us paid more taxes than ever. Stop misleading people. Just stop.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RepSpeier We are counting on Congress to make sure it DOES NOT happen! That’s why in 2018, we put Democrats in the majority.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jennyrachelpal I saw a Trump/Pence sign on someone’s lawn today on my way to work and I immediately thought, wow, those people must be racists/bigots/misogynists/crazy or all of the above. If I see a red hat, I immediately think angry, crazy, and dangerous because—Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JillWineBanks @JoyceWhiteVance @senatemajldr If #MoscowMitchMcConnell doesn’t start passing bills to protect our election, Donald Trump should be disqualified because he’s already been caught cheating once. We can’t let the #GOP take away our free and fair elections.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nytimes Trump should be barred from running for re-election because he’s not doing anything to stop Russian interference. Therefore, he is cheating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyceWhiteVance He should be eliminated from running again because Russia obviously got him elected the first time and they will work to suppress Americans’ votes again to get him re-elected. That is NOT a free and fair election!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guelphgirlchris That’s because @mattgaetz IS a real dick. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nytimes The White House and @realDonaldTrump deny EVERYTHING. Why should we believe anything he or they say? #DonTheCon #Liars<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did he learn his lesson #GOPSenators? This is all your fault, and we will thank you for it at your next election by voting for whomever is running against you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyOstroy He won't resign because he's corrupt. If #Barr had integrity, he would have resigned when #donthecon proposed yesterday's pardons for criminals like #RodBlagojevich who tried to shake down a children's hospital and sell a senate seat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s exactly what he is doing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#ResignBarr or we will #ImpeachBarr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thomaskaine5 Yes, and I think all the news stations need to stop reporting what Trump says when they know it’s a lie. Even though they fact check him right after reporting the lie, the damage of repeating his lies is already done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndrewFeinberg @IvankaTrump Yeah, and it's definitely the crazy narcissistic half, too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neal_katyal Enough already! #ImpeachBarr now!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm donating to Senator Klobuchar!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@maddow PLEASE SUE HIM Mr. McCabe! The Senate isn't doing their job and holding him accountable, so the people need to start bringing civil lawsuits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maddow They're probably planning their strategy for cheating a second time #DonTheCon into the White House AGAIN. We all know Trump would never have won the 2016 election without Russian assistance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, it’s a con job. If Barr was sincere, he would resign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ImpeachBarrNow<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheBeatWithAri @AriMelber #BillBarr isn't fooling anyone. He showed us a long time ago that he was willing to be Trump's puppet.

<|startoftext|>@realTuckFrumper @santiagomayer_ These Trumpfuckers like #GymJordan really hate it when they get caught.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyOstroy @realDonaldTrump It's a little too late. Barr has already shown us that he is Trump's lapdog and has no integrity. It's all talk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BetteMidler You summed him up perfectly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr #MoscowMich doesn’t care about the law and anybody who thinks he does has been living in a cave the past 4 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremyherb No, @lisamurkowski, most people look at Trump praising Barr for intervening and think in the Stone case and think, “the GOP senators acquitted a guilty, corrupt, vindictive megalomaniac.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CNN Yeah, I seriously doubt that. Soiunds like yet another guilty fuck taking a page from Don the Con’s playbook.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joelockhart @gtconway3d That’s because the #Republicans are an evil destructive force.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillKristol @gtconway3d After what I’ve seen of the Republicans, I think they’ve lost every single voter except Trump’s base. That base seems to think that it’s okay to cheat in elections, and bribery and extortion are okay with them, so eff them. Most Americans believe that cheating is wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN @realDonaldTrump already tried to rig the 2020 election. At the very least, he shouldn’t be allowed to run in 2020 because he’s already tainted the election results.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CNN Pretty sad that we have people in this country who think it’s okay for their president to commit bribery and extortion. They should go live in a dictatorship if they think abuse of power is okay. Of course, if Trump gets away with this, we will be living in a dictatorship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nytimes They wouldn’t have a problem of what to call it if they kept church and state separate as the founding fathers intended. It shouldn’t be displayed on government property.

<|startoftext|>@nytimes I think we should storm the bastille if the Supreme Court gives a president immunity from having to release his taxes.

<|startoftext|>@BetteMidler #Republicans have shown us what they’re all about: bribery; extortion; cheating; lying; stealing...the list goes on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidJollyFL @hardball Great analysis of today’s impeachment hearings. @realDonaldTrump tried to steal the 2020 election with our taxpayer money and put us all in danger when he did it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshaRangappa_ @gtconway3d And Jim Jordan was handpicked by Trump to defend him because he knows Jordan is a liar and a loser.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepAdamSchiff You did a fantastic job today of making it clear that @realDonaldTrump used the office off the president to commit bribery and extortion in order to steal an election. Anyone who says that is not abuse of power doesn’t know right from wrong. #TrumpIsATraitor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN @realDonaldTrump committed bribery and extortion to steal an election. Case closed. #ImpeachTheMFTraitorNow<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@agearan @gtconway3d @NikkiHaley #NikkiHaley is making me sick. Does Putin have something on her, too? Just the few quotes she herself has proudly released make her look like a soulless shill for a lowlife sociopath @realDonaldTrump . Not a good look.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@agearan @gtconway3d @NikkiHaley Mrs. Warmbier was 100% right, but Trump's actions were worse than insensitive--it was downright treasonous for an American president to do what Trump did. #ImpeachTheMFTraitorNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeamPelosi We need a third option. Trump, Pence, Barr, Pompeo, Mulvaney, and #MoscowMitch ALL need to be removed from office! #ImpeachAndRemoveTrumpNOW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mitchellreports @MSNBC I can't trust anyone who hitches his or her wagon to such a lawless sociopath like @realDonaldTrump. At least now we know that she only cares about her own political ambitions and could care less about our country and the people in it. #NikkiHaley<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CNN Good! All the press secretaries do for Don the Con is lie for him--he does that just fine on his own.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN She should have listened to them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN This is ridiculous. They are trying every stunt they can because the facts show @realDonaldTrump tried to extort a president of a foreign government for his own personal gain and there is no defending that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@owillis Bannon was right—she is as dumb as dirt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NRCC #ImpeachAndRemoveTrumpNOW #TrumpBribed #TrumpExtorted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyceWhiteVance A president extorting information from a foreign government in order to influence an election is like a football player letting the air out of a ball in the Super Bowl. Unfortunately, in the president’s case, he is also putting millions of Americans in danger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyceWhiteVance Dems also need to get the message out for why what Trump did puts Americans in danger and makes the 2020 election invalid. Trump’s base doesn’t seem to understand even this simple fact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeffsessions You are just a joke. No one in your state could possibly take you seriously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC It is unforgivable how the GOP has conned the uneducated and uninformed people in our country. #TrumpExtorted #TrumpBribery<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC You are pathetic. #TrumpExtorted #TrumpBribery<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyceWhiteVance I never saw @AmbJohnBolton as a patriot, and he’s proving I was right by refusing to comply with a request from congress. Only enemies of the constitution and democracy ignore congress.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You can call everyone and everything fake all you want, but it won’t make it true to those of us who know a common conman when we see one. I feel sorry for the people who ARE fooled by you. #TrumpExtortionist #TrumpBribery<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gtconway3d Maybe Trump can’t pay people anymore to attend his rallies because it’s all going to advertising and lawyers to keep his ass from being justifiably impeached.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RWPUSA @USATODAY Who could even listen to a word this pathetic flip flopper says? We all know he only says what’s good for his own hide at any given moment. #LoseLindsey #DitchMitch #DumpTrump Make America Decent Again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyOstroy @SenJohnKennedy Because these men have no self respect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonLemire Hopefully, @realDonaldTrump will be convicted of his many alleged crimes (money laundering, tax evasion, bribery, and extortion to name a few), will be incarcerated, and barred from writing books or producing and other kind of noxious propaganda.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RepAdamSchiff It is evident to any objective intelligent person interested in facts that DJT committed bribery and extortion. I don’t want a corrupt president.

<|startoftext|>@CarolLeonnig @rachaelmbade @seungminkim BREAKING: GOP lawmakers finally understand that bribery and extortion are grounds for impeachment. The rest of us wonder what took them so long to catch up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BCDreyer @GOPLeader @GOPLeader is both corrupt and stupid—same combo in the White House.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CongressmanJVD I guess you think bribery and extortion are not impeachable offenses. DJT admitted to it and so did his chief of staff, so you can’t pretend it didn’t happen. I don’t want a corrupt president and I hope they vote you out next because you obviously don’t care about the rule of law<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gtconway3d @realDonaldTrump He also tried to say he didn’t know it wasn’t okay to take help from Russia to get elected. He keeps recycling lame defenses. #ImpeachAndRemoveTrump<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RepDougCollins @GOPLeader Because the other party, the Republicans, think bribery and extortion is okay, so it was up to the one law abiding party, the Democrats, to do the right thing. Thank you to the Democrats for saving us from a bunch of fascists. @SpeakerPelosi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader @HouseGOP @JudiciaryGOP @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows @RepDougCollins @SteveScalise @RepLeeZeldin @RepMcCaul @HouseForeignGOP @RepGregPence Strong show of Republicans in favor of bribery and extortion! And you all call yourselves “lawmakers.” You make me sick!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader You don’t think extortion and bribery are wrong?!I’d say the facts so far show that DJT committed at least one act of extortion and bribery while he was in office. Scary that you are a “lawmaker” but don’t see a crime right in front of your face.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepArmstrongND Just saw you on MSNBC.

<|startoftext|>@SethAbramson A man who took help from a foreign government to rig our elections so he could “win” is calling himself president, and he’s actively seeking foreign assistance to do it again.

<|startoftext|>@lisamurkowski if you are really pro-choice you will vote NO on Kavanaugh. It is obvious to everyone watching him evade questions that he will overturn Roe vs. Wade. #StopKanavaugh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamalaHarris Will the Democrats walking out of this sham confirmation hearing stop this confirmation? I think it should be stopped at all costs because there are still hundreds of thousands of documents about Kavanaugh that haven't been released. #WhatAreTheyHiding<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CoryBooker @SenBooker If Kavanaugh has to decide anything about the man who nominated him, he should have to recuse himself on the basis that the man nominated him! #StopKavanuagh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoryBooker @SenBooker Wow! Kavanaugh refused to say he would recuse himself if he had to make a judgement on @realDonaldTrump!!! He wouldn't risk saying he would recuse himself because he didn't want Trump to pull his nomination! #StopKanavaugh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoryBooker @SenBooker Yes! Yes! We do believe that if Kavanaugh is confirmed he will help the unindicted co-conspirator in the Whitehouse go scott free.

<|startoftext|>@lisamurkowski You’re not honoring John McCain if you don’t see that @BrettKavanaugh is bad for women and minorities.

<|startoftext|>@CNN When asked if @BrettKavanaugh received one of judge krazinski’s inappropriate emails in 1991-92, he said I don’t remember. Translation: he does remember but doesn’t want to answer yes. #StopKavanguh #WhatAreTheyHiding #Liars<|endoftext|>
