<|startoftext|>@KIARAH_ I’m happy with my partner but before her i went thru the same thing with many women. Its just luck of the draw if you ask me. I think the best way to go about it is not to expect the best person to come your way. You’ll just let yourself down too many times.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>All these #tiktok guys making these dance vids moving their bodies like women move is gay. I have nothing wrong with gay guys. I have gay friends. But you guys have to stop hiding behind that closet. Some of them bi cuz they have gf’s. Dont their gf’s know? #lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can someone please inform me... why are all these guys on #tiktok making vids of them rolling their eyes and these pov vids not considered gay?

<|startoftext|>If you can be asymptomatic  in reference to Covid-19 then obviously one can be passing the virus along unknowingly. Therefore, you can theoretically be the cause or contribute to someones death. So why are we allowing people to just walk around w/o masks?<|endoftext|>
