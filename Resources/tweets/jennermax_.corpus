<|startoftext|>@thelittleleftie I try to buy what people say about him actually being pretty left-wing, and not just the acceptable face of Labour to the Establishment, but I’ve never been thoroughly convinced. But best of luck to you. (3/3)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thelittleleftie So I’ve spent the past few months in a kind of grudging, unsatisfied silence, not knowing what to say or do. I have tried so so hard to give Starmer the benefit of the doubt — and I still do — but my enthusiasm for Labour has really dried up. (2/3)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thelittleleftie It’s an incredibly vexing situation. If we Corbyn supporters criticise Starmer then it’ll be pounced on as evidence of factionalism, when the Labour right spent five years deliberately undermining Corbyn and trying to sabotage the party’s electoral chances.

<|startoftext|>@glenbishop1 What the hell, make that 'grudgingly accepted'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glenbishop1 Sarcastic apology not accepted. And I guess we can, yes. 🍻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glenbishop1 ... And there it is. You've said that, but also that there 'is nothing nasty about the Tories'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glenbishop1 Calling people out for Tweeting 'dumb shit' doesn't do much to promote open-mindedness either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glenbishop1 Don't lecture me about being open minded when you're not willing to recognise that there is anything bad about the Tories!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glenbishop1 I'm glad it's starting to dawn on you how divisive and nasty the Conservative Party is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glenbishop1 Fair enough then - but don't assume that I'd necessarily vote for whoever was leading Labour at the next GE either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glenbishop1 Bollocks! They're exactly the things the Tory party stands against.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glenbishop1 Nay, I don't think someone who calls themselves a 'meninist' has any right to call someone else's views 'irrational'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glenbishop1 And I don't think hatred of the Tories can be called 'irrational'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glenbishop1 Replace 'tory' with 'labour' and 'left wing' with 'right wing' and that sums your position, using your logic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glenbishop1 He is indeed, and going by pollsters' evidence, Sanders would be very well placed to beat him. Oh well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glenbishop1 That's more like it...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glenbishop1 So you call all his touring around and speech-making and appearing on TV "fuck all" then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glenbishop1 By the same token, you can't blame everything on Labour!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glenbishop1 And that's how logical your Tweet about the US election was.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glenbishop1 You're just the type I was talking about, Glen. This is quite simply delicious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glenbishop1 You have been privileged with an amazing education but tweet dumb shit like that; would you like to have pm johnson?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glenbishop1 I was going to take this light-heartedly but you know what? Fuck you. Bet you're looking forward to having that "cretin" @ No10<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One good thing to come out of the #EUreferendum is the many teenage-Tories-just-for-the-sake-of-it now having existential crises.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Really, the #EUreferendum has fucked things over. As if that needed saying.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Corbyn_Lid @sirrontail @GeorgeAylett You're here all week, I take it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edwardparkerh @GeorgeAylett The whole raison d'être of Progress is to give a platform for such "moderate" Labour voices.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corbyn_Lid And you don't look serious enough to be debating this kind of issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corbyn_Lid Thank you! It's been a while since I've received a compliment about my age!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edwardparkerh @GeorgeAylett Interesting, yes. But, importantly, this would be a policy platform rooted in New Labour thought.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edwardparkerh @GeorgeAylett No, that would be immature. And they do indeed hold similar views. Take a look at their website.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edwardparkerh @GeorgeAylett We cannot count on people who espouse these kinds of views to unite behind Corbyn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edwardparkerh @GeorgeAylett Remember that speech Blair gave telling people whose heart was with Corbyn to 'get a transplant'?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edwardparkerh @GeorgeAylett They represent the legacy of Blairism.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@glenbishop1 Being from the Nasty Party, you should know that, surely?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glenbishop1 No, old boy. Nasty is destroying a country just to wipe out a barbaric group that other nations have so far failed to wipe out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glenbishop1 There's a good boy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glenbishop1 Now now Glen, there's only so much light-hearted banter I can share with a Thatcherite in one day before it all gets nasty...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glenbishop1 Given Cameron's performance, I'm counting down the days till his sneering rubbery pink mug is out of No 10 #VaTeFaireFoutre<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope this episode will put the final nail in the coffin that will be Cameron's legacy and see the Tories booted out in 2020. #SyriaVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, no, no... #Syria.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Taking a stand against "bullying" within @UKLabour fair enough, but is there anything wrong with "demonising" Blairites?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NicHardstaff Yeah... grey, cold, colourless - the only warm or calendar-worthy thing would be my birthday, of course ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Impassioned speech from @CliveEfford... good stuff. #VoteAgainstTheCuts<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What a bunch of ignoramuses there are in the audience tonight. #bbcqt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unimpressed with Cold War-type Russophobia and spouting of Western propraganda by the panel. #bbcqt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who is this bumbling Tory clown on the panel? #bbcqt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yikes! Bit of a right-wing audience tonight! #bbcqt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Success means being disliked by the right people." Given @scrabbmp's words about him, Corbyn seems very successful so far. #bbcqt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you're not prepared to scrap #Trident, @meaglemp, why are you #JeremyCorbyn's Shadow Defence Secretary?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Very good apology, @johnmcdonnellMP, but sad to see how the right-wing media are pressurising you into eating your words. #bbcqt<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Very good points made by @johnmcdonnellMP #PeoplesChancellor #bbcqt<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What happened to collective responsibility? Show some loyalty to your leader @OwenSmith_MP and @KateGreenSU!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeMonbiot - great performance on #Newsnight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeAylett Thanks for the follow, George - keep up the good work shedding light on this government's agenda. #Solidarity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UtopianFireman Should Jeremy Corbyn have shown more respect by being smarter? - Yes 79%. They don't call it the Torygraph for nothing, eh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, to quote Burnham's campaign team, "Oh fuck." La lucha continúa. #TUBill<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure whether to be fuming at @NickBolesMP's odious speech in defence of the #TUBill or pleased at his hatred of views similar to my own.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I hear one more smug Tory mention 'working people', I will seriously consider hunting them down, torching their houses and legging it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good speeches from @NatalieMcGarry, @LizMcInnesMP, @justinmadders and @labourlewis against the #TUBill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good riddance @TonyAbbottMHR - the worst Australian PM ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Andy_JS_ @GeorgeAylett Oh, aren't you funny...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Andy_JS_ @GeorgeAylett Even more reason to like him, I say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's now see some strong women in the #ShadowCabinet. @KateOsamor, @CatSmithMP, @RLong_Bailey ought to all get a look-in. #reshuffle<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NicHardstaff And also by whom the content was written.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicHardstaff Left-wing in a very general sense. And it's not the content that counts, but how you interpret it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicHardstaff Learn the facts before you judge. You think I didn't already "know" this stuff? (Inverted commas cos these are frankly smears)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicHardstaff If she is very left-wing, I need more concrete proof, sorry to say!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicHardstaff Well, I don't know what to say except, one more time, loud and clear: DON'T LET THE MEDIA BRAINWASH YOU!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TulipSiddiq @jackdaviesmusic This is great to see - the Tories are running scared.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrsBurgin @JasonCowleyNS @Mancman10 Obviously...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OfficialSPGB And impossibilism does?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OfficialSPGB @Harryslaststand Yes, he can! This is ultra-left nitpicking. Give the man a chance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicHardstaff I suppose. But I'm afraid it vindicates my theory that Cooper wasn't as left-wing as you thought ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicHardstaff Admirable reasoning. But what if I preferred those male candidates to any female ones? That's no crime.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicHardstaff What happened to you not minding if Corbyn won?? It's #RIPNewLabour, I think. Labour has just had new life breathed into it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jimmoores @NicHardstaff Excellently put, Jim.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicHardstaff And who says the "idealists" who voted for Corbyn don't want Labour in power? Don't buy the right-wing propaganda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicHardstaff @UKLabour Now's not the time to be downhearted, Nic. We've just ushered in a brighter future. The rest will follow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cooper &amp; Kendall show true colours by resigning from front bench. Weathercock though he may be, pleased to have given #Burnham 2nd pref.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a sensational result! The dawn of a new era for @UKLabour #JeremyCorbyn #JezWeDid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deepdelve @zoesqwilliams Comparing "Red Ed" (that is Ed Miliband, as that, in fact, is his name) to Foot is laughable, mate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zoesqwilliams on #Newsnight - brilliant. Great to see that "public didn't like us, we lost cos we were too left wing" argument shot down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#iPhone6s looks amazing!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Harryslaststand Harry, you're an inspiration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicHardstaff @andyburnhammp @twcuddleston I agree. But u can see their motivations. AB's startd to strike me as a decent enough guy though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicHardstaff @andyburnhammp @twcuddleston I was wondering what you would make of that. Hopefully, Corbyn will keep his momentum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkJones48 @LeftistLunatic @Harryslaststand Then what are you doing voting Labour?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn't it ironic how all the people who post and like those '12 year olds then vs 12 year olds now' posts are part of the problem?<|endoftext|>
