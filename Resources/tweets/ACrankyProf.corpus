<|startoftext|>the ethos of this chapter i'm writing about HBO's WATCHMEN is essentially a six year old telling about a book he just finished on reading rainbow.  https://t.co/nfCXc7yFW7<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>my doctor told me that i might have a ruptured appendix, but imma need Chuck Woolery to concur before i go to the ER.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>everybody b like “remember to eat healthy,” but I never got food poisoning from eating a twizzler.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>once, i met @BeBeZaharaBenet, and told her how much i loved her and she said, "i do this for you." then she paused and said, "i don't mean i do this for ALL my fans. i mean i do all this specifically for YOU, sugar."   and i honestly think about that every single day.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>no one:  JkRowling: trans women aren’t real women   everyone: this is profoundly inaccurate and hurtful.   JKR: stop persecuting me!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Idea for a Siri voice that’s just a six year old boy saying things like, “I dunno the answer to that but can I tell you something? One time I fell off my bike and landed on a frog.”<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We don’t make the rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rgay Just added it to my booklist for my class in the fall ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>a game where you substitute one biblical verse for a sign outside a fast food chain &amp; see who guesses right first:  To this John replied, “A person can receive only what is given them from heaven. Spicy nuggets are back. You yourselves can testify that.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>she's not just beautiful, she's thorgeous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>at this point, i'm no longer writing academic prose; it's more like some form of magnetic poetry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>just wrote this nugget about the rhetoric of cracker barrel's description of biscuits on their menu: "like Sisyphus’ boulder, it increases in density the more it is pushed."  for the love of god, someone save me from this book<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ashleyrattner Associate professor of American literature at the University of Alabama, James A. Crank is presently at work on a manuscript and is widely believed to be smart capable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ashleyrattner this is going in my academic bio<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>anyway, in other "i feel like a fraud" news, today, i took two hours to edit a single paragraph of my manuscript.  if current projections hold, this book will drop in the late fall of 2052. look for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>hey, y'all, don't forget that in a culture that normalizes queer grief and anger--queer joy is an act of resistance and revolution. happy pride and Title VII victory, yall!  MOMENTUM!  #LGBTQRights<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>thanks for making it this far in my thread. you're a good friend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and i'd like to know if i'm right, but i will never watch it, so in my head, it's just like 27 minutes of boring calmness and 3 minutes of nonstop running, and now i kinda wanna write a pilot based on that premise<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i've never seen a single episode of the HBO series RUN, but i keep imagining it's about people just hanging out together, doing laundry, or taking out the trash, until one of them yells "RUN!" and everyone starts sprinting.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@billyfatzinger I would actually listen to Nickelbank<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i know I’m a completist but while we’re taking down all these confederate monuments, let’s not forget to remove Tom Cotton’s neoconfederate self from the senate, too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if Hogwarts were an SEC school:   during these troubling times, rest assured that we continue to closely monitor COVID-19 and are taking steps to ensure the safety and well-being of all students who play quidditch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>yeah, sex is great and all, but have you ever killed the spider in your bathroom without asking someone to do it for you?  me neither.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sanford117 @michaelianblack also, think this dude's friends shoulda had an intervention about his troubling soda addiction  https://t.co/ql22OL9kGW<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jeffsessions @DougJones looking forward to your removal next, you milquetoast confederate monument<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JennyENicholson @SamanthaJoHuff maybe something more American like: avoid it like empathy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>hey, i love everyone and am generally enthusiastic about all things, but i sincerely don't wanna go to your webinar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>hey, @realDonaldTrump, pretty sure the only one sick of winning right now is the coronavirus. see you in November.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve eaten 6 this week<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>now, can nickelback change their name, too?  i don't necessarily think the name is racist; it's just a good moment to rebrand white mediocrity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonIsbell, not only is reunions a 100% solid album, but you have single-handedly reminded us all of the pure joy that is a dreamsicle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>finally finished season 3 of #WestWorld, and it was so hard to get through, i'm fixing to put it on my goddam CV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonIsbell spit the mad fire truth, son! finally someone from Alabama confirms that what they call BBQ sauce is really just sour ranch snot. this is an important day for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Variety to quote a song, "whatcha gonna do?"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B_oySix jk rowling's integrity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>so trumpists main enemies are muppets and elderly protestors? got it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the chapter is called "A Barrel for Crackers."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>just finished my chapter on the whitewashing of southern food for this new book--then i pop open twitter and see cracker barrel trending  https://t.co/U5N8rcCKNX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>really enjoying this new potter sequel where harry has to destroy the final horcrux of transphobia and we learn jk rowling was a death eater the whole time; brilliant twists!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>based solely on @DowntonAbbey, i find the main difference between the UK and America is that we don't say "quite the contrary" nearly enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>leaked ending of #IvankaTrump's canceled commencement address: "in closing, my advice to you is this: no matter what happens, try very hard--every single day--to have a rich father with no moral compass who is also secretly in love with you."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>let's focus on those enacting LITERAL violence because of how protests threaten hierarchies and fantasies of white exceptionalism, not those chipping away at confederate monuments or spraypainting a corporate building, ok? thanx for coming to my ted talk. 2/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>hey quick note to all the trumpists peralclutching about "violent" protests: any threat to white structures of power are automatically going to be read as acts of violence: walking, sitting at a lunch counter, hanging up signs, walking slowly together 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump didn’t escape to the bunker to be protected. He was just inspecting it and checking things out   Also, he has a super hot girlfriend that loves him very much, but she lives in Canada, so you probably won’t ever meet her. But she’s rad and totally real.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I keep seeing where we say @realDonaldTrump is showing a deficit of leadership. He’s not. He knows exactly the people he’s leading, and they hear him loud and clear. The NeoConfederates and white supremacists, he’s doing an excellent job leading them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a sign of how rapidly these months have aged me, I just googled,   “How does Instagram work?”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>hey, corporations: calm tf down and stop sending us emails about how Thrifty Car Rental “stands with us” and “affirms diversity.” you don’t gotta make every tragedy an opportunity to capitalize on collective grief.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the older i get, the more i realize that being a grown up is 72% just riding in a car, looking at houses, talking about how big they are, and speculating on their potential drainage issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>me: edits 1500 words out of a chapter  also me: adds 1800 new words<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>april/may 2020 b like: I’m going to test you in ways you can’t even imagine; there will be a plague and a lack of leadership everywhere; economies will fail and idiots will rise.   also, the weather is gonna be really nice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WestworldHBO thinking we’ll be too busy to notice they just using fortune cookie quotes to blurb their episodes now.   we. see. you.  https://t.co/WVEHtDIFsF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>trump is "presidential" in exactly the same way kraft singles are "an excellent source of calcium"<|endoftext|>
