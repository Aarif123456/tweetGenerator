<|startoftext|>@BenRustinCohle @Robmartindale91 @SkySportsNews That would be violent conduct not serious foul play.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCMOTD why do @alanshearer and @IanWright0 not know the rules re. not being able to give serious foul play because of the offside decision? The law is an ass but VAR was not the issue. They followed the rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@capaled Correct.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Larakin_ @DRThomas91 @spassmore99 I don't disagree but the referee's job is to apply the rules, which he did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DRThomas91 @Larakin_ @spassmore99 Totally. He's poor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DRThomas91 @Larakin_ @spassmore99 Which would have been violent conduct. Like I said, the laws are stupid... but them the rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Larakin_ @DRThomas91 @spassmore99 What he did would be considered serious foul play. That can't happen once the ball is dead.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Wrexham_AFC Birmingham City away in 1997. The best I’ve ever seen a Wrexham team play. Completely outplayed a team a division above.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@theDaveThomas82 The irony is staggering.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dylanfbrady Pacific is good but not the same. Follows three groups of people rather than just one. It’s also more graphic (which I get fits what happened in the Pacific part of the war). I want to rewatch all of BoB now. 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dylanfbrady The best mini series. It picks up too from the first couple of episodes. Bastogne (ep6) is powerful TV. And it’s all true. The book is even better BTW.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 @sam_a_liu @DRThomas91 That’s fair to a point but it should give him the opportunity to shine more than he does. Agree re. May too. How many positions are there clear favourites. Can’t be many, surely?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sam_a_liu @DRThomas91 @ben_keen86 And not sure how many matches, certainly top ones, he’s won. Unless the 6 Nations is radically different, it’ll be mostly English and Irish with a smattering of Welsh and Scots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 @sam_a_liu @DRThomas91 Agree Mr Keen. Although Gatland didn’t pick Williams for years because he was just like Hogg so there is hope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DRThomas91 @sam_a_liu @ben_keen86 All the skills in the world. Just doesn’t have the brain to go with it. Always has some stupid mistake in him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DRThomas91 @sam_a_liu @ben_keen86 Gatland will go for big ball playing backs JD fits that bill. We’re going to try and put muscle them. And hopefully Hogg is nowhere near the 15.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Darrenshorty5 @_steviejd_ @thaundadawg @ohwhatagaz You were like Ruddock. At best. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darrenshorty5 @Informalytics There were a million legitimate questions that should have been asked of Cummings and weren’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Informalytics The questioning for the majority of Covid times has been dreadful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darrenshorty5 He’s really not the victim here Darren...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darrenshorty5 I think old Dom is about to attempt to pull a rabbit out of the proverbial hat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darrenshorty5 Said i agreed re. press. However, stand by he's brought this on himself. If he thought it was ok why not say it weeks ago rather than pretending he was in lockdown in London?  He wrote it. Expected millions to do it. People couldn't hold their dying children and he's doing that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darrenshorty5 And if anyone has lacked class, it is the government who are lying and blustering their way through this. Somehow they are making it worse at every turn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darrenshorty5 Correct on media hounding. However 1) DC is the one who wrote the Covid plan that meant people have missed funerals etc. It's no wonder they are angry. &amp; 2) the CMO of Scotland held her hands up and paid the consequences. All of this would probably have gone away had Dom done so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danthedealer @Informalytics Yep. He always had time. It was almost too easy for him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebarryhorns @emyr987 For me: inability to run an effective opposition when we needed one, let alone a country; For others: nationalisation, spending plans, antisemitism, links to IRA. Made it easy for the press.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebarryhorns If you're going to be a Labour Prime Minister, you can't have the skeletons in your cupboard that Corbyn had. Made it easy for right wing press. He didn't help himself though. You're point about Momentum is an interesting one because they say the opposite. I think you're right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emyr987 @thebarryhorns That's not totally true. I think there were significant red flags (no pun intented) with Corbyn which made many think twice. As for whether he'd have been worse, I honestly don't know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebarryhorns He/She's right though. Too many thought Corbyn was an even worse prospect.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@7puzzle @TheWelshDragon9 I’d choose Henson anyway. A once in a generation talent. The fact we struggle at 12 anyway makes it the only sensible answer. Imagine him at 12 putting foxy in the gaps at 13.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deiniol_w Yes. Disingenuous at best in my opinion. Hope the three of you are keeping well!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deiniol_w Respectfully disagree. One rule for most, another rule for old Dom. And now a cabinet minister is trying to re-write history. At the point he went to Durham, the rules were extremely clear, which is why a government scientist was forced to resign. The hypocrisy is nauseating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This just says people don’t understand how good Henson was. My late father always used to say how Henson at his best reminded him of Barry John.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @wayne_1603 @SoccerAM You were actually in Eindhoven?! PS - Gareth Bale is easily the best Welshman to play in the PL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @wayne_1603 @SoccerAM You were watching England at that time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eleni_sibbald I feel his pain. Although you can get semi decent gluten free bread.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GazTrow @r77ulr If they are lying (and I have no reason to believe they aren't), they're pretty stupid as it's a fairly easy thing to prove/disprove.   Rich  - are you talking the fan loan/director loan?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheCoeliacSloth @JustGFBakery How does it compare to say M&amp;S stuff?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrdanwalker one for @BBCBreakfast? 👍🏻 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is my niece. Having seen Captain Tom walking around his garden, she decided to run around her garden 100 times every day to raise money for the NHS.

<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @michaelsheen Very.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #quiz. @michaelsheen is a genius.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone who thinks the wrong people won #RaceAcrossTheWorld, that they gave half their winnings to a street children’s charity says otherwise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#raceacrosstheworld final is where it's at.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>👀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drmarchant1 @Patriots Definitely. Like the away one too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amazing I've been to see these 4 times. Never on the road though!  https://t.co/fv2dAW7PDc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The noise in the Millennium Stadium that night was incredible. Remember ending half way up the top tier when Bellamy scores. #WALITA02<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So #phantomoftheopera was a little more than alright.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @theDaveThomas82 As an England fan, it must have been ultimately disappointing?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Tonygibson65 @robdnoble19 @PMbythesea @JRWalsh @mrdanwalker Plenty of vile on all sides Tony. That’s the issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wrexham @fearlessidzine Potentially but less likely as less people movement. Doesn’t the comparison need to be by population too for a fair one? That may make your point further. I have no idea. I’d argue NE Wales should have more tests for similar reasons as Gwent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wrexham @fearlessidzine They are doing more tests where there are known outbreaks. Said that last week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheCoeliacSloth Is it a 32 bit game? I had the same with another one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robdnoble19 @PMbythesea @JRWalsh @mrdanwalker It certainly doesn’t but it does show there’s very little difference in the vile on both sides.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DRThomas91 @sam_a_liu Well if work happened to say we need you in SA at that time...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DRThomas91 @sam_a_liu Wow! What a great player he was.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sam_a_liu Gareth Davies at scrum half?! 😂😂😂 Wales have two better than him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GriffinSpurs I’ve got one on my Facebook page. Also thinks the world is flat...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@llantwit @shavtaj @ILovesTheDiff I’m in Adamsdown too. Practice not made up. Something official - totally fabricated by both.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shavtaj @ILovesTheDiff The practice bit was correct. Making out this was something official when you have no idea whether it was or not was irresponsible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shavtaj @ILovesTheDiff You’ve just made that up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those who know me best will know how hard I found resisting this.  https://t.co/L8vxv4wd3h<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbutler1978 @WxmRob You know it will be. I’d argue they have to cancel the season and make it void but appreciate there are complications to that approach.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neiljmcevoy @mazza0311 Yes but it’s the governments disregard for the weak in society - those who are old and those who are sick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neiljmcevoy @mazza0311 It’s not even the unlucky. It’s the weak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mazza0311 @neiljmcevoy They’re still going for herd immunity.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@itvnews this is in Bala, Wales not Scotland.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DazbcfcEngland Without a doubt. Should have been more than 3 points.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great tackle from Slade. Tuilagi has been getting away with that and worse all day. #engvwal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnAdamsPigeon Disgusting play by Jones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is that not a penalty to Wales? Lawes shoulder hit AWJ head. #ENGvWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@David_Moose They’ve got away with that all afternoon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All those who used to moan about Warrenball have gone very quiet. #ENGvWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And defensively abysmal. #ENGvWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is like Wales pre-Gatland. Lots of shiny stuff, scored some great tries but ultimately not good enough. #ENGvWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hello. #ENGvWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dylanfbrady It’s softer than that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Complete architects of our own downfall. How do you go from stealing a line out on their 10m line to conceding a try. #ENGvWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanG1878 Clear penalty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>England by 15. #ENGvWAL #6nations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well said @GThomas_93. We think sport is everything. In reality it’s just something. #ENGvWAL #6Nations<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis Totally. Doesn’t have a position. That’s his problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darrenshorty5 Two tries for France down to Wales mistakes too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Paul O’Connell clearly doesn’t watch Wales much. That was guaranteed to be what happened next. #WALvFRA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The reason Wales are losing is because France have played better thus far. That said, some of the refereeing has been abject. #WALvFRA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanRhysJames He’s missed blatant offsides but wales are their own worst enemies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That could be pivotal. #WALvFRA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanG1878 We are the total architects of our own downfall here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>France blitz excellent (if often offside). Gareth Davies’ slow delivery adding to Wales’ issues. #walvfra<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GWRHelp That’s because it sat outside Newport station for over 10 mins.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GWRHelp No worries Andy. 😂 11:17 from Lon Paddington to Cardiff. Arrived in Newport 13 mins early so just had to wait.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GWRHelp Hi Jake - do they teach you how to use a customer’s first name?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got to love the new @GWRHelp trains from London to Cardiff. Much quicker but unfortunately the timetable hasn’t been updated so we then had to wait for 15 mins at Newport. #FirstWorldProblems no doubt but it seems pointless having the faster trains.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@theDaveThomas82 @stebrett Absolutely. People know Boris is bad. They think Corbyn is worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Informalytics @carolecadwalla @RaymondSnoddy They’re part of the club. Why would they?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theDaveThomas82 @stebrett Not a fan of Toynbee particularly but this is close to the mark...   https://t.co/hplzL7JMRT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theDaveThomas82 @stebrett I couldn’t believe they fell into the trap Johnson and the SNP wanted. They had a 40 seat majority!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theDaveThomas82 @stebrett The election was a stupid idea from Lab and Lib point of view. I said so at the time. Corbyn was too toxic for Labour and the Lib Dem’s are frankly bonkers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OJDBROWN Corbyn was a big issue too. I’d agree it wasn’t only about Brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OJDBROWN How so?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cerys_Ruth Corbyn was a bigger issue than Brexit. Certainly with the centre ground.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drmarchant1 @UKLabour Agreed. Boris will need to be held to account. Corbyn is not capable of that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drmarchant1 @UKLabour Bingo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanRhysJames Yes bro. 100%.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanRhysJames Yes plus Corbyn. He’s toxic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>John McDonald is bonkers. People don’t trust Corbyn. That’s the problem for @UKLabour. #GE2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanRhysJames Correct. I’ll be better off with a Tory majority but it’s a disaster for the poor and vulnerable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanRhysJames I said they were stupid agreeing to an election at the time. It was always a trap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 Haha.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. Goodbye Corbyn if that exit poll is correct. #Ge2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh dear... 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jennalouise80<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thepaulwilliams I get what you are saying. However, referees influence the winner of a game in rugby more than any sport. Garces gets the blatant things right. He just makes lots of poor decisions the rest of the time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesvobrien He doesn’t seem to understand the rules or certainly how to interpret them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 He made things 20 times as difficult for Wales last week. After today, I’m extra proud of how we showed up on Sunday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching a re-run of the #RWCFinal - I see Garces hasn’t improved his ability to referee the breakdown or the offside line.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Darrenshorty5 I think leaving is a terrible thing but agree there is an overwhelming moral point to leave. It’s just ironic that in people’s desire to strengthen the UK it’ll end up dismantling it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darrenshorty5 Brexit will result in the break up of the UK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 Not sure how you figure that out when we were leaving the EU, customs union and single market. What else did you want to leave?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 It meant leaving the EU, the single market and the customs union. Therefore it was brexit. Maybe not a brexit you or he liked but Brexit none the less.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The irony. This guy and his chums in the ERG have already stopped us leaving the EU at least twice by voting agaisnt May’s deal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanG1878 @Trevla He was but a northern hemisphere ref helps us. Maybe Barnes?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeRossUK The referendum was advisory. That’s a fact. Also a fact, the HoC voted overwhelmingly for Art 50 as you say. Which is why, even though I think Brexit is incredibly stupid, they should do it. For moral reasons not legal ones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ukreloaded @Rich_Hopwood Wasn’t going to mention the bus. I think there’s a moral case for Brexit. People voted out. I have more problem with people who voted for parliamentary sovereignty moaning about that being exercised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ukreloaded @Rich_Hopwood Is that really the level of your debate?! Shame. I was to have a civil conversation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ukreloaded @Rich_Hopwood You mean from Boris or parliament? If parliament, then they voted for an advisory referendum in 2015. Cameron declared it would be more than that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ukreloaded @Rich_Hopwood It’s simple James. Regardless of your views on Brexit, parliament is sovereign not the prime minister.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@benfides @ben_keen86 @tonylivesey @bbc5live I hear you but think this is different. There’s a realistic opportunity brexit can be stopped. For many, I feel this will mean they vote Lib Dem/nationalist/green.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benfides @ben_keen86 @tonylivesey @bbc5live I think you underestimate the Brexit issue. Labour have no coherent policy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benfides @ben_keen86 @tonylivesey @bbc5live Middle classes are not going to buy in so far and Corbyn is an issue. They also risk haemorrhaging pro eu to the Lib Dem’s. My prediction - large Tory majority as brexit vote solidified behind them. Lib Dem’s 2nd biggest party. Labour 3rd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 @benfides @tonylivesey @bbc5live Which shows they are neither. As for Corbyn - he was ok but it’s not enough to win an election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benfides @tonylivesey @bbc5live And people think the Beeb are pro remain. It’s madness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Corbyn won’t win without the middle classes. He’s not appealing to them here. #LabConf19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebarryhorns A Tory government with a large majority. Labour obliterated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CjClockwork No. The referendum asked if we wanted to leave not how. But surely, we should also take on board the promises of the leave team.  It’s all one big mess. Morally we should leave but Boris J has no moral high ground over anyone. He’s a liar and he should resign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CjClockwork The vote was to leave. Not how.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CjClockwork But yet you’re moaning about parliamentary democracy in action.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CjClockwork If the arch Brexiteers has voted for May’s deal we’d already be out...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CjClockwork Agree with the first two sentences but not the last. Boris - despite the bluster - is driving the latter not having it as a fallback.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HuwFulcher @dylanfbrady @tombaker8596 There’s worse things he could come back doing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tombaker8596 He’s right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CjClockwork Yes but one was Brexit in any circumstances and one wasn’t.  I’d agree that brexit should be implemented - we can clearly extrapolate that from GE2017. The issue is how should that be done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CjClockwork Yes but that point of view ignores the result of the 2017 GE election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CjClockwork I don’t have that power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CjClockwork Are you serious?! They have the democratic mandate of their constituents to do what they believe is best for them. That’s how a parliamentary democracy works. You may not like that but that’s our system of government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CjClockwork And he should resign because he lied to parliament and he lied to the Queen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CjClockwork Not disputing either. But at that election hard Brexit wasn’t wanted by the majority. From the moment TM lost the majority the game changed. Because, as you no doubt voted, parliament is sovereign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is how it started in 1930s Germany... time to wake up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CjClockwork 4) it’s not being contemptuous of democracy, it’s how our democracy works.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CjClockwork 1) when MPs voted on having a referendum, it’s clear they authorised an advisory one.  2) DC promised to implement it.  3) no government is bound by the unfulfilled commitments of its predecessor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CjClockwork Your logic is flawed. They are not bound to implement the result of the referendum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CymroBarfog Guess he has no shame.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CymroBarfog It’s incredible. Massive judgement for our democracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@streboria @JoStevensLabour Yep. there are some good people in the party who'll be affected by the drive of parts of the leadership.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@streboria Agreed. We’ve got a great Labour MP in Cardiff with @JoStevensLabour but with Cardiff being pro remain that’s going to be a difficult sell for her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@streboria How to split their entire vote between the Tories and Lib Dem’s/Greens. Madness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afneil @ExiledPreacher I am not saying that the result should be ignored but it shows a lack of understanding on how government works in this country to say that this government is bound by a prior one. That said, both Tory and Labour manifestos were to leave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afneil @ExiledPreacher Partly correct. When parliament voted for a referendum it’s clear that it was an advisory referendum. The government of the day then said it would implement that result. However, following the GE this is a moot point as any government’s pledges has no sway over a future one.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@premierinn any chance of a drink in Tower Bank in London? Been in your restaurant for 40 mins and still waiting. #slow #slowservice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavePrentis @JoStevensLabour Correct but unless labour comes out for a 2nd referendum properly, they’ll lose countless seats to the Lib Dem’s including Cardiff Central.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarethPW Started well. Went downhill rapidly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#London  https://t.co/LOteU3IISd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Partly agree with this but Bale also hasn’t helped himself. His refusal to learn Spanish and get involved always meant this would end badly. Contrast to Aaron Ramsey’s mindset in Turin.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CTSport @Jackeo02 What position did you play @Jackeo02?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theDaveThomas82 Because he’s a populist who tells people want they want to hear. Dangerous times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cardiffcouncil your signals on Callaghan Square roundabout are out of sync meaning only 2 or 3 cars can enter each time from the West. @therealfootsie<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#princeofwhales genius. 🐋 🐳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deiniol_w Massive respect to him for making Poch his first one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tlldavies @alukey @thebarryhorns I haven’t forgotten that. I can deal with transition but Giggs is making the same mistakes every game. Tactically we’re a mess. He’ll get until the end of the campaign and that’s probably fair but he needs to make some improvements quickly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tlldavies @alukey @thebarryhorns Coleman had to take over a team that was grieving. That was a thankless task. Once he realised he needed to be his own man with his own tactics etc we improved. I see no evidence of that with Giggs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomiCaws @fearlessidzine You’re right. But that’s also not an excuse to accept it. There was/is a chance to build on Euro 2016. Not looking likely now and Giggs shows no idea of how to fix it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbutler1978 Agreed. I’m also not sure he understands the game. Both his team selections have been baffling. We all know Bale up front on his own doesn’t work for starters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alukey @thebarryhorns He can’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbutler1978 People have had success and they see a team that should be better than the one at the Euros, rightly or wrongly. I’m all for letting things settle but there is no discernible plan and it’s getting worse not better. Giggs has some big decisions to make.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbutler1978 Not sure why it’s surprising. People’s expectations are higher than they were. We missed Ramsey tonight but there seems to be no plan and most Wales fans are content because we’re not as bad as we were under Gould. I could deal with it if we’re improving but we’re getting worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nik66Shanahan @only1Hollett @Trevla  https://t.co/6cPEjA9y8Y<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CreweJonathan @78Spirit Agreed. and the buck for that stops with Giggs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheLeckwithMole No it’s not but he’s responsible for the way the team is set up. It’s not working.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit Has Giggs shown you anything to say he’s grasping this?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheWelshDragon9 Brooks has hardly trained and Bale looks uninterested.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lee_spear92 @thebarryhorns @CalSheppard Brilliant is a bit much. Buck stops with Giggs. It’s not good enough and he shows no signs of making it better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@only1Hollett @Trevla Not sure his desire is still there.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@markbutler1978 It’s weird. I don’t get what Bryn is playing at...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OurCymru @CaroWild @AnnaMcMorrin @tfwrail Absolutely. And we’re just going to tinker around the edges with a transport system that needs massive overhaul.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaroWild @OurCymru @AnnaMcMorrin @tfwrail Shame. If you live in the east of the city you’re forced to be on the road...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebarryhorns No sir. But having someone sit in front of an inexperienced back four was a must.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@longyinit @DafW94 @thebarryhorns And it was too hot. Both sides were the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YummyPreserves @thebarryhorns @Boycie1996Iwan He can’t be blamed for Ramsey’s absence but he set us up far too open and didn’t play the experience he had. Onto Tuesday and hopefully 3 points.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YummyPreserves @thebarryhorns @Boycie1996Iwan We have. That just makes Giggs’ ineptness all the more frustrating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darrenshorty5 Giggs is the problem, not the answer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darrenshorty5 Too inexperienced too. There’s no leadership.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lordtimfry @stebrett No pal. No one from work on Facebook.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DRThomas91 @deiniol_w With the quality of team they’ve had over the past four or five years they should have won something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deiniol_w They had an unfit striker that didn’t help. Tactically they were pretty much on the money, I thought. They just didn’t execute well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DRThomas91 @deiniol_w Improbable comebacks are one thing. Winning big games consistently is another. Kane and Alli are frequently missing the bigger it gets. I stand by that. They’ve lost those games in the EPL and cups for years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deiniol_w It’s mental with spurs. Any big game. Needs to get players with experience of winning them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So for 26% of the electorate, Brexit is more important than anything else. Total madness.  "They want to get rid of the NHS" "Don't worry, we'll have our country back" 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well done Liverpool.  Spurs mess it up in a big game again. #UCL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Liverpool are playing like they’re Wimbledon in 1988. #hoof #ucl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenPaterson @ScottWoodfield1 So they lied...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neiljmcevoy @JessFishlock Ian Rush Joey Jones Ryan Giggs Jayne Ludlow Gareth Bale  And hopefully Ben Davies tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A rare breed on @BBCBreakfast - @LFC fans actually in Liverpool. #UCL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deiniol_w @dylanfbrady No but you’re not playing against some European giant that might affect you mentally. If Liverpool play to their best they’ll win. 3-1 scousers is my prediction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dylanfbrady @deiniol_w Boys... to quote Sir Alex, “it’s only Spurs”. You’re better than them. I wouldn’t worry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BartonBank 1st last thing is Corbyn with one?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BartonBank Tories should call an election now... they’d smash him and Labour. Most ineffective opposition ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The defence of a guilty person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Neil_Stup @oakley8376 @neiljmcevoy Cardiff will only grow and thrive if the infrastructure grows with it. I see no evidence of that from Cardiff council.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve said this all along. At its core #Brexit is all about English nationalism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ginge_1 23c by Saturday!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ginge_1 You haven’t seen the weather for next weekend then?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Corbyn is as bad as the Tories. Only interested in power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yesacuiby @BBCNews You never know!! In answer to your original question, they’ve been fairly balanced. Both in and out feel they are biased against them. That said, my point was not about their coverage in general but specifically around their early coverage last night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frankolufc @drogpower @PaulEmbery I didn’t even mention Labour but as you have that’s exactly what happens in South Wales every year. Until yesterday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frankolufc @drogpower @PaulEmbery I’ve not once said he should be. Just pointed out that voting for the people you agree with is what politics is about. In fact, if more people did that rather than just voting the colour rosette they normally do, it’d probably be better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yesacuiby @BBCNews Please tell me you haven’t been counting each week for the past 3 years?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting that leave parties have less seats than 2014. You wouldn’t have realised that based on the coverage of @BBCNews. #EUelections2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tallpaulo82 @theDaveThomas82 The union will be broken within 15 years tops. Scotland will leave and Ireland will unite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OJDBROWN @brexitparty_uk @LibDems @Plaid_Cymru @TheGreenParty Not by as much but yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drogpower @PaulEmbery But surely the point of an election is voting for the party you agree with?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drogpower @PaulEmbery Surely that’s what everyone should do?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thepaulwilliams How on earth do you get that from tonight’s results?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally... @JohnCurticeOnTV speaking some sense on @BBCNews. #EuropeanElections<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sam_a_liu @BBCOne #legend<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So according to @BBCNews the #EuropeanElection2019 results show that the country voted for a hard Brexit  even though the Brexit party had less than 40% of the vote. If anything it just shows how divided the country is not to mention Corbyn isn’t the answer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theDaveThomas82 Corbyn will say it’s proof people just want to get on with Brexit. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @therealfootsie @piersmorgan Indeed... idiots on either side but at least these idiots are throwing milkshakes rather than murdering MPs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @piersmorgan It was a set up...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yesacuiby @piersmorgan Better than murdering MPs, I guess. Idiots on the extremes of either side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A manifesto that failed to get a parliamentary majority. Hence the need to compromise and work with other parties.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rhodrielisjones Wow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie @murph_stephen Should I do?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie @murph_stephen How much?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rhodrielisjones @bcarswell Agreed. Brexit, I think, is madness enough though I understand others disagree. People voting for a party that shows no interest in Wales and whose leader couldn’t even name one benefit of Brexit to Wales is on a whole other level.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bcarswell You could well be right. But it’s sad that for so many, bearing in mind this poll was for Welsh Assembly elections, aren’t thinking beyond Brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another slippery slope...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 It’s sad that for so many people Brexit is the only thing that matters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 Don’t be! Was a helpful read. Always good to read a differing point of view.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 Thanks. The poll I posted was for Welsh Assembly elections not for the Euros but many of the points are relevant. I disagree with much of what is written but that’s democracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 Will try and find that. Thank you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is utterly bonkers. Regardless of your thoughts on Brexit, why would you say you’d vote for a party that don’t even have a manifesto.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bigsimon69 @IanG1878 Both of those are quality. Especially the 2nd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ginge_1 Partly true. He offered a referendum so he could stay as prime minister and then resigned leaving us in the much. May made it worse by calling a totally unnecessary general election and lost her majority which has resulted in the current mess.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Darrenshorty5 @_steviejd_ @Virgin @TomMockridgeVM I had a similar experience when they had wrong details on my account so refused point blank to speak to me.

<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 Exactly. That was in normal time too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 when you’re dealing with officiating like this, there’s no chance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dezroberts1 Don’t forget the stonewall penalty not given.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@yesacuiby @spareylee @theDaveThomas82 @CarolineLucas @theresa_may History will not judge her kindly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spareylee @theDaveThomas82 @yesacuiby @CarolineLucas I believe we should leave as that’s what was voted for, even though it’s completely against what I want. If @theresa_may hadn’t called a completely unnecessary election, you’d have what you wanted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spareylee @theDaveThomas82 @yesacuiby @CarolineLucas They did mate but as far as we know they didn’t break the law. And let’s not pretend that all 17.4 million wanted a no deal hard Brexit. And therein lies the problem - everyone has their own version of what they want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@svencjohn_steve @cathynewman @PGMcNamara Corbyn deserves nothing but contempt. However, this whole mess is on @theresa_may. Called an unnecessary election, lost her majority and it’s all unravelled from there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@svencjohn_steve @cathynewman @PGMcNamara There’s a majority in parliament to leave. If May bothered listening to people as opposed to trying to keep the conservative party together she’d find it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@svencjohn_steve @cathynewman @PGMcNamara No one has said we’re not leaving so hardly the best analogy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Informalytics @thepaulwilliams Wouldn’t disagree but she has made mistake after mistake after mistake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benfides @David_Cameron Leadership... 😐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thepaulwilliams The issue is with the PM not parliament.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 you ok hun?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s amazing what politicians will do when the whiff of power passes their nostrils.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@john_melfyn @thebarryhorns Try looking again... we’re definitely there...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YWalGoch_ Even though the result was not what we wanted, watching Wales play in the semi final of a major championship on my birthday takes some beating.  https://t.co/FzJV8FBDm7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking good!!!  https://t.co/jWSvqgqQgO<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HeathrowAirport Can you not enjoy the @HeathrowPod experience?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HeathrowAirport All sorted now thanks. Off to the @HeathrowPod!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Waiting longer for our bags at @HeathrowAirport then we spent on our @British_Airways flight. #firstworldproblems<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of the most poignant place I’ve ever been - the memorial to the murdered Jews of Europe.  https://t.co/bLa8ZwUgEe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gatland doing what all great coaches do - giving the players all the credit. #WALVIRL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ireland, by keeping the roof open, have played into Wales’ hands. Strengths of defence and goal kicking to the fore. #WALvIRE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@posh_esther @WhitfordBradley I love Leo’s little parable at the end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PodcastPeldroed Plays basketball.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sobering time at the #Berlin bunker. Excellent exhibition on how a populist like Hitler used people’s dissatisfaction with politics etc to his own ends. A parable for our times.  https://t.co/gi3Ry44msC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stebrett Near potsdamer plats. Loving it so far!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 @sam_a_liu We’ve just finished it again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@British_Airways No idea Mahsa. It was like a summers day in Barbados without the sand or the sunshine. Good job by the pilot though in difficult conditions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Arrived in Berlin. Hottest @British_Airways flight ever. Just as well I needed to lose a few pounds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 No one has voted to overturn Brexit. They’ve voted to rule out no deal and extend A50 to allow a better deal to be done. This has been totally caused by May’s plan to wind the clock down rather than trying to build consensus. And don’t get me started on Farage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 Ironic considering he was campaigning for the sovereignty of parliament. Then again, it had nothing to do with that when he’s just a Russian puppet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The irony...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theDaveThomas82 @HeathrowPod @HeathrowAirport Berlin, Germany 🇩🇪<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cannot beat @HeathrowPod at @HeathrowAirport. #podride  https://t.co/56Tfzo1b87<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ginge_1 That’s harsh. Don’t you think @Stand_by_G?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@E16KW @gareth1864 Probably a bit of both but moving to 442 would have been bonkers with Pearson let alone without him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@E16KW @gareth1864 We’re a hard team to beat when we have a good defensive spine and can scrape the odd goal. Unfathomable change of plan tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbutler1978 @fearlessidzine It’s just random the amount of abuse the players are getting but the manager gets a free pass?! Playing 3 in midfield should have been a must (even with Grant).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fearlessidzine Bryan Hughes going to get any grief for a completely random change of formation?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@E16KW @gareth1864 Stupid change of formation on a two day turnaround from the last game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@huw_tal @Darrenshorty5 @theresa_may The issue is what the leave campaign promised cannot be delivered. No deal won’t get through parliament without a 2nd vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 @theresa_may Yes... @DavidDavisMP and @DominicRaab want to leave. Both quit because they couldn’t deliver the lies promised at the referendum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darrenshorty5 @theresa_may Such is the sad state of British politics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darrenshorty5 @theresa_may She’s frittered away two years trying to force her deal hoping that people would choose that rather than no deal. She’s lost two votes in parliament by over 140 votes. Any other PM would be gone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MonkeyJunkX @bbclaurak Because she basically did nothing for the first 18 months.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And when you thought it couldn’t get any worse up pops @jeremycorbyn. #brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How can @theresa_may carry on?! #brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrivingMaul @TheWelshDragon9 Typical Garland. Wales peak at World Cups and bring their A game under him. 2015 was wrecked by the number of injuries but 2011 was a tournament they could have at least made the final.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrivingMaul @TheWelshDragon9 We’ve also given away 0 of any attacking game plan before the World Cup.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#FreeSolo is absolutely mental. Incredible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattyWebber88 They are better technically than us. That was clear to see. We never stopped though. 9 left. All winnable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattyWebber88 Yep. And Leyton Orient have to play both. Still everything to play for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y @Wrexham_AFC Very... good number of us here.  https://t.co/fI9D4HBalz<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@capaled1991 You’ll be down there mega early!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DragonheartWxm 6:30 felt bad enough. See you there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fearlessidzine See you down there!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pooley_kyle @louistheroux @danreed1000 It’s repeated on Saturday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theDaveThomas82 The media doesn’t help. They peddle the nonsense as opposed to calling him out on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrynLaw Reckon we’ll be around 1k? A few of us making the journey from Cardiff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikP1927_mike @thebarryhorns Attendance wise maybe. Squad wise not. Warnock has done a good job (although some weird decisions defensively recently).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SionWilliams Cardiff fans should remember what they were saying about that squad before the season started. He’s done a good job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Roll on Orient next week. Can’t wait @Jackeo02 #weareoneteam #wxmafc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fearlessidzine I’m going from Cardiff. Can not wait.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@capaled1991 I meant for me!! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@capaled1991 Hopefully there’ll be some left down there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Warburton was the best Welsh 6 and 7 at the time by a mile.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very proud of my late Uncle Alun’s involvement with the @air_ambulance. What a great work they do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is Chris Grayling still in a job?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbutler1978 @gareth1864 The Ospreys cost a lot of money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GriffDavies you might want to order online if you haven’t already.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesvobrien Drove in Sicily. Wonderfully bonkers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheWelshDragon9 He should consider changing 7, 10 and 12.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheWelshDragon9 He was superb today. Superb.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No more than they deserve for this 2nd half. #WALvENG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Superb kick from Biggar. #WALvENG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What do I know?! #WALvENG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheWelshDragon9 Yep... He's the reason we're losing... 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis Yes. It's stupid he's not involved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a problem when your scrum half has bad hands. #WALvENG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>England are throttling us. Expecting them to run away with it after half time as we tire. #WALvENG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What on earth was Tipuric doing? #WALvENG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gruffter I'd play Anscombe every time but I'm in a minority<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gruffter @__davidlewis Peyper is a beauty of a ref.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>England are back in the 2003 version of the game. Kick, kick, kick then power and pace. #WALvENG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeaderRich @Wrexham_AFC That's a great point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanG1878 Ridiculous decision .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie @LeeJarvis10 Awesome!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ginge_1 @BBCNews Not how it works. We get to deport other countries criminals. She was radicalised here and should face justice here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCNews @ginge_1 She should come back to the UK and face justice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wrexham_AFC Can I phone up and then be posted?! Happy to pay for postage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrsCardTweets An amazing lady!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fearlessidzine Yep. Know of a few of us going from Cardiff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fearlessidzine Could be a massive away following.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Paskins_tache @bentollitt Makes Barrow’s reluctance to play him even more baffling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattCarrel @dev2y I saw him playing for Wrexham!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattCarrel @dev2y I saw Stevie G himself play in the champions league.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y Well it isn’t worth comparing to Boreham Wood v the Mighty Wrexham but I was just underwhelmed by it all. YNWA was incredible. The rest of it like being in a library.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y I’ve been to more Champions League games at Anfield than most Liverpool fans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Overrated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tombaker8596 Sounds epic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Their explanation will be to blame the EU or even Theresa May.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hey @McDonaldsUK - when are you going to catch up?!  https://t.co/pRN5zv7nBE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#lisbon  https://t.co/8doiOi6d49<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheWelshDragon9 No way should GD start at 9. The speed of his passing is a liability and if England have line speed like against Ireland it’ll put us in big problems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martinworgan @TheWelshDragon9 2 games in 5 days at the World Cup. We’ll have that amount of change then too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y In LA? Griffith Park observatory is cool. Especially at night.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Lisbon  https://t.co/yCNFv8uPJE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y Loved Santa Monica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JosephToplis @easyJet Yes. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This still tickles me from yesterday’s flight home. @easyJet announce only one piece of hand luggage (incl. laptop bags) so this guy just stuck it up his coat.  https://t.co/7qcpsELWt4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3rd flight in three days. This one for pleasure.  https://t.co/u2WLxIEDSl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@r77ulr @fearlessidzine @Tada1973 I’d imagine so... everything else has followed that poor decision. Hopefully they’ve learned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrynLaw @dezroberts1 @Wrexham_AFC They clearly thought DL was coming and then he didn’t. Having already appointed GB they were in a pickle. Everything else flows from that poor decision.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ben_harveyyy @WhiteMatty95 @fearlessidzine @Wrexham_AFC @Tada1973 Name the loads...  If the board thinks he’s the right guy then they have to back him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ben_harveyyy @WhiteMatty95 @fearlessidzine @Wrexham_AFC @Tada1973 Loads?! Really...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dezroberts1 @BrynLaw @Wrexham_AFC Agree Barrow was a dreadful appointment but do you really think they appointed Hughes because he once played for us?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteMatty95 @fearlessidzine @Wrexham_AFC @Tada1973 We’re going to just expect him to leave his job for 4 months?! Real life doesn’t work like that. Nor is there any protection for us if we do well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dezroberts1 @BrynLaw @Wrexham_AFC Barrow was the poor appointment. Fail to see how Keates or Ricketts was.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhiteMatty95 @fearlessidzine @Wrexham_AFC @Tada1973 What would you propose?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Williams_Wales @LeaderRich @youngkilshaw @Wrexham_AFC Any reason in particular?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@E16KW @youngkilshaw @MattyWebber88 Appointing barrow for 2.5 years as an assistant before Dennis Lawrence had signed was the worst decision. Everything else flows from there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fearlessidzine Much happier now Barrow has gone. Hopefully Newell is going too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kgeorge1979 @BrynLaw Rumour on FB is Bryan Hughes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s hardly the full story. #WxmAFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@E16KW @BrynLaw He should never have been appointed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbutler1978 @fearlessidzine They should never have appointed him in the first place. That’s what was amateurish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@n_rhys @dionwills16 @fearlessidzine Someone on the FB page saying he’s going to Ricketts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rodgers 😂😂😂😂😂 #superbowl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JosephToplis Hopefully the guys in white. Intriguing game though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JosephToplis Hard going. You?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ll take 3-3. Should have been 7-3. #superbowl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rams won’t play this badly in the 2nd half. #gopats need to step up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveyGwilym In a #GoPats Super Bowl. It’ll liven up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What on earth is Brady doing?! #superbowl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here we go. #superbowl #superbowl53  https://t.co/nspg0lyaOY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which begs the question why some homeless people won’t sleep in these night shelters. Until they are sorted out people will continue to sleep rough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Technically the Irish guy was tackled without the ball.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EFCStats If mourinho is the answer, you’re asking the wrong question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesvobrien Doesn’t surprise me. I had people moaning about the disallowing of Moriarty’s try even though AWJ had taken someone out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesvobrien He was good on the whole. Ignored offsides from kicks for both sides but other than that he was great. Gutted he’s not reffing us v Ireland.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darrenshorty5 @jamskipotatoe They are, however, we just did to them in the 2nd half what they did to us in the 1st. We we’re just better at it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 Any team that wins from 0-16 down will feel like they got away with it. France adapted best in 1sr half. Wales 2nd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 Was a dreadful quality game. Poor tactics first half from wales thankfully rectified at half time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1) first game, we’re normally poor 2) it was raining like crazy and we played the first half like it was a warm spring afternoon 3) we vastly improved when we changed tactics at half time  Banana skin avoided. On to Rome. We’ll get better. #FRAvWAL #sixnations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis I get why Biggar makes sense in these conditions but Davies is just poor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheWelshDragon9 I’d take Rupert Moon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheWelshDragon9 My namesake is having a mare...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 Wait for their mistakes I said...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These 3 points were directly from they Gareth Davies interception. For the first 20 mins of the 2nd half we playing the France’s half but we’ve gone back to doing what we were in the first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My namesake is dreadful. #FRAvWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@Nigelrefowens have referees been told to ignore the offside line at kicks?!  @WorldRugby<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@David_Moose Gareth Davies’s passing doesn’t help either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@only1Hollett We’re doing what I said to do... if it’s obvious from my front room you need to wonder why it’l too so long for the bench to twig.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amazing the difference when you play to the conditions. #FRAvWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 @Trevla Amazing what happens when you are playing in the right areas and not trying to force passes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Nibb_ @TheWelshDragon9 We’ve been dreadful. Absolutely dreadful but this is a game that is calling for us to play territory and live off French mistakes. We haven’t done that. You couldn’t argue with any of the 15 being taken off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Nibb_ @TheWelshDragon9 They are kicking the ball behind us and taking advantage of our mistakes. We’re trying to force it. 9 handling errors.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @wayne_1603 No Trev... we went 16 points behind at the end of the half...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_Nibb_ @TheWelshDragon9 The conditions are one of the main reasons we’re having a mare. The French are playing them perfectly and we’re carrying on like it’s a warm spring afternoon in mid March. It’s madness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BartonBank Why aren’t we kicking the ball?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @wayne_1603 You on the pop Trev?! Why are we trying to run the ball from everywhere?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not much love for Anscombe but if we’re going to run the ball from everywhere when the conditions are dictating we should kick then this is only going to get worse regardless of who is at 10.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@only1Hollett Exactly... we should be kicking it into the corners.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis They’re just playing the conditions. We’re trying to play like it’s Paris in late March.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @wayne_1603 Think about why they’ve had the ball so much Trev. We’ve dropped the ball every time we’ve had it. These conditions are all about kicking to corners and relying on mistakes. Working a dream for the French so far...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 And the conditions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrdanwalker Just go back and enter your old password in on the login page. It’ll work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 Our tactics are dreadful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheWelshDragon9 Tactics need to change. this is just incredibly stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@only1Hollett This is all on the tactics...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mellyrugby @TheWelshDragon9 Lazy and predictable narrative. Parra has missed two kicks too. We’re indisciplined in every phase of this game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are so indisciplined. #FRAvWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis We are like headless chickens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheWelshDragon9 No chance... game plan appears to be run it from anywhere. Bonkers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Should have been a penalty to wales. Didn’t release after the tackle. #FRAvWAL #sixnations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Adam_Lewis412 Not sure Gareth Thomas has ever read from an autocue before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’ve watched two minutes of six nations sin bin. What a load of rubbish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Snow in deepest splott must be a whole lot worse than it is in Roath/Adamsdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is snow...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ginge_1 @tfwrail A lot will depend on 1) schools and 2) @tfwrail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tfwrail Ridiculous considering the total lack of snow in many of those areas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie Where’s Stuart Poole when you need him?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You’d think we were about to have something similar to the US.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@deiniol_w You still bitter from the champions league final? 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How cold?! 😮<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ended up celebrating Burns Night at the local Chinese last night. I wasn’t going to go but my mate twisted my arm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@only1Hollett Yes. Repetition is key.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do people on #hunted watch previous series?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Um... he was assassinated...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 I’ve loved the whole, “I don’t know why the patriots think everyone said they were rubbish” narrative. A month ago everyone was writing them off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer @JoStevensLabour In fairness, your party leader refused to meet her. You hardly have the moral high ground.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>He doesn't mind talking to terrorists who haven't disarmed but he won't help sort out one of the biggest issues facing this country unless no deal is dropped?! Surely that's the point of talking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>25 days in. Still haven’t got through all the socks I had for Christmas. 21 pairs clearly a conservative estimate.  https://t.co/gz6O8rOyqW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Evri1KnowsADave @Hunted_HQ The TV crew might have given it away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I reckon I’d get caught pretty quickly on #hunted but I wouldn’t make some of the basic errors of this lot. Have they never seen the programme before?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatriotsSBLIII 2017 wasn’t much better. Incredible they made it through.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuaneJarvis That’s how I used to come home from school!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AlunEbenezer @FulhamBoys_KK @FulhamBoys You’re a big deal bro. Im not surprised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Drew Brees answers @neilreynoldsnfl question as to whether he can be put in the same bracket as #TB12 on the first play of the game. I love DB but he’s no 🐐. #NFLDivisional #skynfl #nflonsky #skysportsnfl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Toffeecat10 @NFLonCBS And then we have to go back to Neil Reynolds. 😐<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Same old story with the Colts. As soon as they’re outside they’re rubbish. #nfl #NFLUK<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@theDaveThomas82 @Anna_Soubry She shouldn’t have to be brave. It’s crazy and the police just watched it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theDaveThomas82 It’s disgusting. And these idiots don’t understand they are the equivalent of Nazis not Soubry (whatever one thinks of her politics).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ILovesTheDiff Where’s that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Paskins_tache That was Barrow’s opinion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GMB_union @SDoughtyMP The reason fares are so high is years of chronic underinvestment. Most of which when they were publicly owned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's better than Stirling already.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BarnetByBike @Manuel_TSSA @SDoughtyMP @TSSAunion @TSSAScotland @ABCommuters @LabourLeft @PeoplesMomentum @AndyMcDonaldMP @chunkymark You live in dream world if you think Germany’s rail prices are 65% lower than ours due to profits or money spent to that end. I’d agree that the franchise model is fundamentally flawed but public ownership is not the magic bullet to fix prices.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@only1Hollett @TreharrisAthFC @AbergavennyTFC Great. Been waiting for this all Christmas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarnetByBike @Manuel_TSSA @SDoughtyMP @TSSAunion @TSSAScotland @ABCommuters @LabourLeft @PeoplesMomentum @AndyMcDonaldMP @chunkymark You tell me... nowhere near the 65% reduction in cost required though.   Biggest issue is paying for years of underinvestment in rail. Including when it was public owned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Manuel_TSSA @SDoughtyMP @TSSAunion @TSSAScotland @ABCommuters @LabourLeft @PeoplesMomentum @AndyMcDonaldMP @chunkymark How do you propose that would help bring the cost per mile down to the level of Germany?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RichWXM “Graham Barrow is a red, is a red, is a red. Graham Barrow is a red, he hates Ricketts”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KyleJonesIV @OwainTJones17 I do to and enjoy his podcast. Regardless of friendships etc, SR is not the victim here nor has he been thrown under a bus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The gall of the man who’d made a decision to manage our arch rivals and then still expected to remain in the dug out for Saturday’s game. Makes a mockery of @OwainTJones17’s ascertaition that SR was hung out to dry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @dev2y @MattCarrel @LFC Never seen you do a poll about Cardiff...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing to do with @AaronRodgers12 of course. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fearlessidzine It would be the funniest thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@huwtroberts @Wrexham_AFC I’m out that night too. 😐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“Shunned”... no mate. We’re not the ones who want to move to our arch rivals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheGroundHoper @tonymoore78 @philblanche Ramsay in central midfield is a disaster. Didn’t you watch our last game?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwainTJones17 @BrynLaw I understand why he’s gone for it in one sense - better facilities, more money, further up the pyramid etc but Ricketts is in no way the victim here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrynLaw I’m probably way off. Hopefully it will be all sorted in the next day or so and we can move on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrynLaw @OwainTJones17 Added to that the atmosphere would have been toxic. Totally the right decision.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwainTJones17 The issue was caused by somebody blabbing and various reports on social media that said a deal had been done on Weds/Thurs. would have been toxic for Sam last night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4) j) Ricketts isn’t pleased but stays away still claiming he hasn’t made up his mind what he wants to do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3) g) this puts a scupper on waiting until next week as Wrexham social media implodes h) Ricketts still wants to take charge of the team as he’s not talking to the Shrews until Monday. i) #WxmAFC board know it’ll be a toxic atmosphere if SR is there so say stay away<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2)  d) we go back to @shrewsweb and say to speak to him you’ll have to pay the release fee in his contract e) @shrewsweb agree to pay this but both sides agree to do nothing until after the FA Cup game as it’s now Friday. f) someone blabs to the media<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Piecing together bits of info from various places of the whole Ricketts saga at @Wrexham_AFC. Could it be: a) he applies for the @shrewsweb job b) they approach #Wxmafc who turn it down c) Wrexham board tell Ricketts of the approach who tells them he’d like to talk to STFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fearlessidzine Tues 11th or Weds 12th. Guess it depends on TV scheduling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fearlessidzine We won’t get that many tickets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FootieNick @tredragon Because Dean Saunders is likely to know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@E16KW @ChairmanBryn @WrexhamDragons Also - it’ll be balanced against what we have to pay if we sack a manager.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BIG_WIJ @Wrexham_AFC @Tada1973 We may well be but it’s hard to see what the board could have done differently with this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BIG_WIJ @Wrexham_AFC @Tada1973 I was laughing at your joke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Welsh_Dragon_71 @thebarryhorns @Wrexham_AFC I wasn’t apologising on your behalf. I was apologising on behalf of the rest of us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@barlow1981 @Wrexham_AFC No. Most people are annoyed with Ricketts. The statement is very carefully worded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebarryhorns Apologies. We’re not all like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lewys_Cymro @thebarryhorns @Swanseapassion Those of us who are @Wrexham_AFC fans are also fuming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit Our statement is extremely interesting. Gives nothing away but clearly not happy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackFreeburn I’ve no reason to believe that it wasn’t true at the time. The club statement was also interesting worded to the extent that it’s making me wonder if we’ve had one yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@r77ulr @Tada1973 hope you boys have got your hard hats on. Keep the faith. Going to be a bumpy few days/weeks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackFreeburn They both said no approach had been made.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesTh25355186 @RichWXM @fearlessidzine 🤦🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackFreeburn They didn’t say that...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hdotjones @fearlessidzine Apparently it was too early for a release clause.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyMcNally11 @BBCSport You’d suggest keeping him there?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joeroberts1995 @E16KW Not sure I follow your logic...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Paskins_tache @SvavaJones that's a fair question to ask (though I'd guess we are if we're following LMA rules).  Lets not forget it was only 2 years ago the board were getting heavily criticised for picking the wrong types of manager. last two have been bang on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Paskins_tache @SvavaJones Who knows. If we're using standard LMA contracts as we've stated previously, i'm guessing the break clause would be what they recommend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattCarrel @dev2y just playing. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y @MattCarrel much footage of this or just a love in?  https://t.co/Wb7YcPK5v6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Paskins_tache @SvavaJones Who said I was happy? I don't think anyone is happy... most adults understand the way football contracts work and there's not a lot we can do about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Paskins_tache @SvavaJones It's absolutely frothing. What do you expect the board to do if Shrewsbury have triggered the release clause?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SvavaJones @Paskins_tache You’re wasting your time. Easier to just froth at the board.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ytiraloPehT @Paskins_tache 😂😂😂🤦🏼‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit Odd. Isn’t it?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zionhopkins1 And me mate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zionhopkins1 If they’ve hit the compensation figure we can’t say no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Paskins_tache They said there’d be no approach. It’s more then plausible there hadn’t been.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All I can say is that her other daughter, Ella Mennow-Pea, is glad she stayed at home.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@creights5 @EmmaTouhey @Wrexham_AFC Don’t disagree we’ve missed a front man for years. Last year was the big chance though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@creights5 @EmmaTouhey @Wrexham_AFC The best chance was last year. The NL was dreadful. Far more quality at the top this year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gouldina @bairdyblues @JackoRugby You didn’t need to explain it. It wasn’t funny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gouldina @bairdyblues @JackoRugby He watched five replays...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @SoccerAM The right answer.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Nik66Shanahan Incredible goal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Underwhelmed by Fantastic Beasts part two.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichWXM @E16KW The bizarre thing is he seems to be ignoring our best result and the formation played (Ireland home) and seems tied to this 442/424 type formation. I just don’t get it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichWXM @E16KW Giggs has no clue. That’s becoming more and more apparent by the day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheWelshDragon9 He’s not learning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuaneJarvis Just as well you lost weight, wouldn’t have wanted a rerun of this. 😂  https://t.co/idGqJObkKp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla The green cheats by the looks of things.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AlunInHope @E16KW The joys of living a 10 minute drive from the stadium.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daniel_preece @carey1927 In fairness, that exactly what Giggs should have picked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Paskins_tache @fearlessidzine He was slow coming out. He needed to sweep and didn’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Paskins_tache @fearlessidzine He should have done better with the first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PodcastPeldroed I agree the shape was wrong. However, if you’re going to go with that shape Ramsay is not your man. In fairness to him, he looked like he hadn’t played much in the last 3 months which he hasn’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alanepetersen She won’t get it through parliament.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PodcastPeldroed Both were wrong. Needed three in midfield. Ramsay cannot play in a midfield two. He’s not disciplined enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbutler1978 Agreed but we all know Ramsay is not tactically aware. I don’t understand how anyone with half a brain can set us up with him as one of the two central midfielders. Denmark attacked his space all night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickelias4 @matt_the_jack Ampadu is a Centre half. Also he was only playing there due to injury. Ramsay the big issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PodcastPeldroed He wasn’t great but if you’re going to call out any Wales players, it’s got to be Ramsay. Allen did the work of two in that midfield.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbutler1978 Correct. Giggs doesn’t get it tactically. If you’re playing a central midfield two, one of them can’t be Ramsay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cjones996 @TheWelshDragon9 It’s not. And if it’s a two, the two can’t include Ramsay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Viv_Savage_CFC @paulmwrexham @BBCBreaking The same reason they’re ignoring any links between Farage, Banks and the Russians...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dezroberts1 Can not wait...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattyWebber88 The BBC Wales only gig was because no one else wanted the fixture. We’re easily one of the best four fixtures. I’ll be amazed if it’s not picked before BBC Wales/S4C have an option.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattyWebber88 I think BT sport get first pick. (They have 3). BBC1 has one. I’ll be amazed if we’re not one of those four games.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattyWebber88 @Wrexham_AFC @EmiratesFACup @NewportCounty Which should work in our favour.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Another morning, another insane #cardiff sunrise. @ILovesTheDiff  https://t.co/tW6mbDXKOe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tilehurstroyal @TomLewwis @TheSportsman Quite possibly but then it’s no surprise that your team is better than ours based on 1) the number of people playing football and 2) the infrastructure of the game. Not really anything to brag about...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s a new golden generation. Heard it here first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NonLeaguePaper @capaled1991 Well done on that one piece. Great job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stebrett @theDaveThomas82 @_steviejd_ I wouldn’t remember “all” victims of war... (and id also hardly say it glorifies war either).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stebrett @theDaveThomas82 @_steviejd_ Absolutely. Let’s remember the nazi soldiers who died... 😐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rhodrielisjones Dreadful team set up this evening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thatphillad @_steviejd_ We were bad but we were set up to fail. 3 at the back left massive gaps on either flank which they exploited. That it took Giggs 30 minutes and 3 goals to realise this speaks volumes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TwmbarlwmSam @DylanEbz @principalitysta @Cymru The football being dreadful probably had something to do with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebarryhorns I still wouldn’t have started Ashley.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too many Welsh football fans worried about a light show and people wearing daffodils rather than the ineptitude of Giggs’ team selection and set up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbutler1978 @78Spirit They did put their skills on show but man alive we helped them with the way we set up and the 11 we put out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebarryhorns Bang on. The way he set us up initially was wrong too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thatphillad 1. £££££ 2. Gives the opportunity for more to see us play. Spain were the wrong opposition though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thatphillad That’s the issue. Tactics.  Ps - the atmosphere is rubbish but that’s not why we’re crap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thatphillad Nowt to do with the venue...<|endoftext|>

That’s up to them. It’ll come crashing down at some point. What’s more irksome is the media fawning of them and the nonense about budgets and wages being the same. Just admit their spending more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@only1Hollett @jamskipotatoe And tackling someone knee high isn’t just making sure he goes no further. You pull someone’s shirt for that. It was a stupid challenge that allowed the referee to interpret it as a straight red.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@only1Hollett @jamskipotatoe Just been on the rule book. Hits criteria for serious foul play and violent conduct. No opinions. We’re right. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie @only1Hollett @jamskipotatoe @CardiffCityCCFC @CardiffCityFC A cynical foul would be a yellow. The fact it’s knee high and dangerous turns it into a red.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@only1Hollett @jamskipotatoe It was dangerous and at knee level = red. Never mind the fact it was cynical.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@only1Hollett @jamskipotatoe @CardiffCityCCFC @CardiffCityFC Jamo’s right. From behind it’s a clear red.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@only1Hollett @LuaneJarvis Couldn’t have played that better myself.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PaulAbbandonato @SDoughtyMP @SkyUK @btsportfootball It’s because they don’t offer the same thing. They bid for different bits which mean if you want it all iou have to pay for loads with different companies. Clubs make more money. Fans lose out.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That’s how. So @Browns. #nfl #NFLRedZone<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mickytricks @brianmoore666 Not me. Watch red zone instead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EfanIfor @YesCymru Absolutely, but it’s time to focus on the bigger picture on what independence brings. The potential is for this to be so much better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EfanIfor @YesCymru A shame too many nationalists don’t get that message across as they’re too busy moaning about a bridge. There’s a compelling case for independence. It’s about time they started preaching it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is set up perfectly for us to lose 1-0 or the Danish players play after all at the last minute and give us a shoeing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When you wake up and think it’s Thursday and it’s only Wednesday...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DazbcfcEngland The point you retweeted is bang on though... no more moaning people couldn’t get tickets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DazbcfcEngland Thought that might be above your level of understanding.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@thehuwdavies @PodcastPeldroed Yes. I think you’re right. Too much for some people in one go. Many of the people around us didn’t renew. Hopefully they’ll have got single tickets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuaneJarvis You’ve gone the same colour as me!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehuwdavies @PodcastPeldroed Yes. Some that were £20 in the last campaign are now £35. I get it’s cheaper than the rugby etc but I know of a number who didn’t renew their season tickets because of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PodcastPeldroed Agreed. Tickets are more expensive too. A lot more in some seats.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gareth1864 Sums it up. Got back to Cardiff in under 2 hours with a stop.  Poor game though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichWXM Agreed. Was like watching a game from last season again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikehughescq @markbutler1978 @CalonFM @Wrexham_AFC @SolihullMoors They played the referee. And we’ve done exactly what they wanted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikehughescq @markbutler1978 @CalonFM @Wrexham_AFC @SolihullMoors Agreed. He’s been poor today but playing in a role and style that doesn’t suit him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikehughescq @markbutler1978 @CalonFM @Wrexham_AFC @SolihullMoors We’ve been terrible. Absolutely terrible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikehughescq @CalonFM @Wrexham_AFC @SolihullMoors Bingo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikehughescq @CalonFM @Wrexham_AFC @SolihullMoors That’s exactly what’s going to happen. It’s like the 17/18 version of Wrexham has reappeared.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit Agreed but our team selection has resulted in us playing exactly as they want us to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrynLaw Bang on. No pace, no width and no purpose in attack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie Bonkers pal. Must be 700/800 in the ground and it’s not even half two.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Broken__Monkey @hugoowen1 @LeaderRich @Wrexham_AFC Great idea. Everyone would know then. Including clubs we’d be trying to buy people off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smileyrhi Wow. 😯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamieJRumble @joseph83beck @GNev2 @SalfordCityFC It’s the irony of him moaning at other clubs for wanting franchise football when he in essence has created a franchise.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@benfides I would agree with this.  https://t.co/F9jghk7XtJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benfides Not sure it should have been reviewed as it was neither clear nor obvious. The fact he had to look at it so much should have told him that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonnblaze @MatthewGridiron Yes. His opinion is wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is never a penalty. #FRACRO<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@smileyrhi @GarethBale11 Good work!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jcorrigangolf @riathalsam There’s no point. I had the same conversation with English friends. They just don’t want to hear it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benfides @mbarnes @bcarswell Ben, just because you used it like that doesn’t mean everyone did.   But to outsiders it came across as presumptive (and not just the celts).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benfides @mbarnes @bcarswell No one has any issues with English fans daring to dream. In fact, for English friends who’ve been through the lows, it’s been a pleasure seeing their excitement and reminded me of the Euros.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benfides @mbarnes @bcarswell I’ve never heard Wales sing that song about Bale. (And the lyrics is can not will 😉). They normally sing a far cruder one about Bale choosing not to play for team GB.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benfides @mbarnes @bcarswell Like I said, you can choose to ignore what outsiders feel but it’s not just the Welsh or other Celts.  Fully aware of where #itscominghome came from (it’s a great football song) but you know it’s not just the hashtag. That was an example.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bcarswell @mbarnes @benfides I just told you how it feels to outsiders. You can ignore that if you wish but Luca Modric showed that it’s not just a nationalistic anti English Welsh mindsets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mbarnes @bcarswell @benfides And an even bigger difference between #itscominghome and #TogetherStronger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bcarswell @benfides @mbarnes It grates because some act like you’ve won the tournament before you have. Appreciate it might not be like this to you guys but from the outside that’s what it feels like. See Luca Modric’s interview last night to how it made them feel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benfides @mbarnes @bcarswell I try to be objective and can hopefully appreciate good sport no matter who plays it.  The whole “it’s coming home” thing really grates the non-English. That doesn’t excuse any vitriol but I can understand why people celebrate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benfides @mbarnes @bcarswell Some of us will stay there forever. 😉  On a more serious note, I started the tournament as not caring. That got harder as the tournament went on. Probably driven by the media but that was my experience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benfides I realised about 10 seconds after pressing tweet but was too proud to delete it. Haha.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benfides ps losing in a semi final sucks. We know how that feels. ☹️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benfides Why is it odd Benjamin? It’s no different from you not supporting Swansea/Bristol City... it’s football.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Southgate as classy as every afterwards. England will do ok as long as he’s manager. #ENGCRO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 @jamskipotatoe We really don’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 @jamskipotatoe And that’s why all other football fans love it when you lose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 @jamskipotatoe Everyone got carried away as you English fans always do...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @ScottWoodfield1 Indeed. We know how gutting a semi final loss is though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 Most overrated semi final run in history. Beat Tunisia, Panama, Sweden. Drew with Colombia and lost to the only two decent sides you played.  I get you can only beat what’s in front of you but i think England performed par for the course. Gutting for you though pal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 Stop it. I’m going to cry.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@simonrug @mckay1402 @mike_hancock13 @PaulAbbandonato @rj07thomas @WalesOnline Fair point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulAbbandonato @mckay1402 @simonrug @mike_hancock13 @rj07thomas @WalesOnline Did you copy and paste that from Simon?! 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simonrug @mckay1402 @mike_hancock13 @PaulAbbandonato @rj07thomas @WalesOnline it's not just there to get clicks? I presumed it wasn't to cause divisions. Was I wrong?  it's a shame because your stuff is good. Your website, however, is the most annoying sports website due to the number of videos etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mckay1402 @simonrug @mike_hancock13 @PaulAbbandonato @rj07thomas In the case of @WalesOnline click bait.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wozzerabes @jamskipotatoe @CezDavis Truth is in the middle somewhere. Some English people, particularly those connected to Wales supported them. There were others who were bitter and gave nothing but abuse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simonrug @mike_hancock13 @PaulAbbandonato @rj07thomas Take your point re  vitriol of abuse but even this thread stated that people who didn’t support England were full of hatred.   At the end of the day it’s a sporting event. It’s really not that important.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simonrug @mike_hancock13 @PaulAbbandonato @rj07thomas In the last week or so particularly the media has been whipping it up (even the BBC). Each to their own and people have their reasons for either side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mike_hancock13 @PaulAbbandonato @rj07thomas @simonrug Nor do I have deep hatred or jealousy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mike_hancock13 @PaulAbbandonato @rj07thomas @simonrug I find, driven by the media, that there is more criticism for not supporting England than for supporting them. Ultimately everyone is free to support who they want.  I won’t be supporting them but that doesn’t make me narrow minded or any of the other things I’ve been called<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuaneJarvis It’s supposed to be your day off! 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benfides Hope you’re not smashing taxis or ambulances up in Newtown. 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@only1Hollett Yes... remarkable resemblance...  https://t.co/S4hccXJlGc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuaneJarvis It was meant as a compliment (honest). 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesvobrien Most of what he’s tweeted is bang on. They’ve clearly followed our blue print.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Were you on someone’s shoulders @only1Hollett?  https://t.co/x85up18zjW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuaneJarvis Well I guess if you can be taught so can I. 😉😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MatthewGridiron @WillGav @wyattrich Completely right. Those teams are also saying exactly the same about England. Anyone’s tournament but probably a Belgium v England final.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuaneJarvis Look complicated!! 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuaneJarvis Nice speedboat! 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oftheVotadini @harleysid @DazbcfcEngland If you go back far enough we’re all Welsh. 🙂 enjoy this week fellas. You’ve got as much chance as anyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebarryhorns I’ve not seen one tweet where @ILovesTheDiff has endorsed supporting England. Not caring whether they do or don’t does not equal colonialism.  The “your” comment was silly but hardly along the lines of @BBCWales or @WalesOnline this week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamieNeef He was probably a Jack if he had a Union flag.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DazbcfcEngland @harleysid Wasn’t looking for an arguement. Was a genuine Q. Enjoy your celebrations pal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harleysid @DazbcfcEngland Genuine question... why do the English get so funny about the Celts supporting someone else?! Not like you were all willing Wales on in the Euros. Football rivalries isn’t it?!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WillGav You’ve dominated a team but not managed a single shot on target other than the penalty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WillGav Have you been watching the same game?! Both sides have been poor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe Very overrated. Always said it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @Trevla Bit harsh. They’re people too.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @Ms_JulieJ Absolutely. Not saying it’s any different. But it’s not great in a week they’ve been moaning that they aren’t England’s cheerleaders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ms_JulieJ @Bigt8409 Agree. However the journalists don’t help themselves when they make a big thing about not being the team’s cheerleaders.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bcarswell 4. Sport is the only place Wales gets to compete with England 5. They are rivals  6. The patronising attitude many English (certainly in media &amp; politics) have to Welsh 7. English insistence we support them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bcarswell 1. history (same as England fans supporting whoever is playing Germany) 2. Current poor deal Wales gets from Eng  3. “British” media is biased to England compared to others (even home nations) to a nauseating extent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuaneJarvis You can mock... 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bcarswell Being and English Kiwi must be confusing. 🙂  PS - I wasn’t talking about people who “side with” England. It’s the full on supporting of any team that isn’t mine. Just don’t get it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuaneJarvis I’d win a road race. Honest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bcarswell Benjamin, why would it be otherwise? Would a Kiwi support the Aussies? Would the Germans support the Dutch? Would the Canadians support the Americans?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jayrowee Or, as you’re a Liverpool fan, supporting Manchester United in a Champions League final?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jayrowee There’s wanting them to win and then supporting them like your own team.   Just because I find something odd doesn’t mean it’s hurting anyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samwood2345 Ross Moriarty was sent off for that in the @WelshRugbyUnion game on Saturday.  How was it not a penalty?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theDaveThomas82 The union will be gone within 10 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welsh people supporting England like it’s their own team is the oddest thing ever. #worldcup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on Tunisia. #worldcup #ENGvTUN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smileyrhi Good work!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlunInHope @FAWales If we played like the qualifiers, not many.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@raj_2406 @TheWelshDragon9 @rhys_patch He’s not the best 9 at the scarlets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheWelshDragon9 @rhys_patch He needs to fix 9 as well. Must help getting a pass 3 seconds before he would have done from GD.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rhodrielisjones Amazing what happens when Biggar isn’t playing 10.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tmalbrghtn @TheWelshDragon9 Good timing. 🙂 Id go as far as to say Faletau is the best 8 in the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tmalbrghtn @TheWelshDragon9 Faletau would be my first name on the team sheet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jacqui_Smith1 @UKLabour I’m trying to work out where he thinks they didn’t lose it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 True. The difference of not having Biggar at 10 is staggering.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theDaveThomas82 @jeremycorbyn It’s like a cult Dave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 I’m trying to work out when we started looking good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crazy the amount of world class back row players @WelshRugbyUnion have. They could field 3 different ones with no drop in quality. #argwal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheWelshDragon9 He was poor last week too. he's too bulky to play 13.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @theDaveThomas82 Definite red. 2nd man has a responsibility to the man in the air too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuaneJarvis I’m sure that me in the gym would provide you with much amusement. 😂😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuaneJarvis Keep going. You’re doing good!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlunInHope And there’s the real reason - politics. The great world cups were great because it was the best teams they were there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlunInHope Agreed. Just not sure the balance is correct.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smileyrhi  https://t.co/8SIzzzuAXG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smileyrhi @Cymru I only remembered because someone else made a comment about the Ireland game being a Thursday night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ToryMember @sarahwollaston So Hannan never said that no-one was talking about leaving the SM? Next you’ll tell me we never had the message about £300m for the NHS on a bus?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ToryMember @sarahwollaston Really?!    https://t.co/C9yByqwxPz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ToryMember @sarahwollaston Have you asked all 17 million to know what they voted for?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jessicaelgot @JoStevensLabour @Keir_Starmer Corbyn will.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seeing #RUSKSA makes a mockery that teams such as Italy, Netherlands, Chile and, dare I say it, Wales aren’t in the World Cup. #FifaWorldCup2018<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing like leaving renewing our @Cymru season tickets til literally the last minute @therealfootsie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theDaveThomas82 It was on at a decent time. I can remember some of Mexico 86 but the games were on late. Also our ages at the time helped. There was a magic about it then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @theDaveThomas82 That’s because your beloved England got to the semi finals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theDaveThomas82 Remember it like yesterday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ginge_1 @piersmorgan @jamskipotatoe He makes sense about nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ginge_1 You need to learn how to mute conversations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaxterCymru11 @TRW91 It’s in Scotland. Wishaw.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taylorichards_ A scrum half with a decent pass would make Patchell even better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Scott Gibbs" haha. Well done @martynewilliams for picking up on it. #argwal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheWelshDragon9 And can’t pass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rhodrielisjones We’ve got 4 if not 5 opensides who would walk into most international sides.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_steviejd_ I notice the guy who’s having a photo with you wears glasses...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCP_14_ It’s not something to celebrate. He shouldn’t be doing it at his own expense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WSTtweets this shouldn’t be the case. This should be paid for by the club, not coming out of @Tada1973’s pockets.  https://t.co/jAgspiThHO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How can hay fever be this bad already when I’ve not even gone outside yet?!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @Everton @IanG1878 No mate, they’d just presume they were club 15.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 I know what that’s like. Rained for the whole 4 days we were there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peanutismint It just rained for 4 days solid. After the first couple of hours we just got used to it. Still good tho.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@paulmwrexham @gareth1864 Yes that’s the other obvious fit in the EPL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmwrexham @gareth1864 I was saying earlier that, as much as I hate them, their style of play would be perfect for him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattCarrel @dev2y @Trevla Escalated quickly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Viva Gareth Bale. #halamadrid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.  And yet @dan_ward52 still can’t get a game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benfides Hope not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benfides Shame they’re such a one man team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thought Liverpool were supposed to be an amazing attacking machine. This is like watching a Mourinho coached team. #UCL2018 #ChampionsLeague2018<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WobH @RJonesUX It wasn’t the centrists who enforced everyone having to vote for the Brexit bill which is just grabbing power back from devolved government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WobH @RJonesUX I’m not crying about that, I can assure you. I do wish they’d provide a more effective opposition though. And if they can’t provide an opposition, how on earth would they govern?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesvobrien If only Wilbur could do that. 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DerbyChrisW @campbellclaret If the overwhelming majority support your policies why aren’t they voting for you?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindaSayle @Danny_McTurner @RJonesUX @artemis0801 @acgrayling Great. You’ll just never win a majority and so achieve nothing. Haven’t seen such an inept opposition for 20 years.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@neilreynoldsnfl I didn’t think he came across well. Answers can be summed up as 1) we don’t understand as much as he does 2) it’s not illegal so there’s not much to do. There wasn’t even an apology.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenLLewJones @cardiffcouncil @JoStevensLabour @NigelHowellsCdf Thank you Owen.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@E16KW Nor mine!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MattyWebber88 I couldn’t work out if he was serious or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanG1878 @clairedabear85 Total shambles. Not sure why they didn’t do a pre sale this year rather than just open it to everyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanG1878 @clairedabear85 Nope. Got none. Really annoying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gridiron Getting message saying tickets aren’t available. 😐<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kingsevans @DragonheartWxm @WSTtweets @youngkilshaw Thanks for a your hard work. Living in Cardiff it’s an invaluable way of keeping in touch with everything at the club.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joneslee76 @KateOLoughlin1 I ain’t biting pal. (Unlike you). 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joneslee76 @KateOLoughlin1 Wrexham are my team pal. Not even close.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KateOLoughlin1 @joneslee76 He supports Aston Villa but that’s another story. 🎣<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@apakastan @marcd81 @PP_Rich_Hill You think Eric Rowe was the issue in the Super Bowl?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@only1Hollett @haven @WalesOnline What?! Really?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Catching up on the @NFL draft. @nflcommish is as popular as ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanG1878 @neilreynoldsnfl I wouldn’t but for new fans it’s vital.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanG1878 @neilreynoldsnfl If we want NFL to be a huge sport in the UK, a UK franchise needs to happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie @Trevla so the UK will be getting a franchise then?!  https://t.co/o5ckL1d5fM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCMOTD Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WintsM @RyanJonesOnline @SwanseaUni @cardiffuni It’s higher than what the Ospreys get.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deiniol_w @LFC Haha. Hardly. Sooner he leaves @Everton the better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe Why would they be biased to the Italian team?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samwood2345 i don't get why they're playing so open. it's just stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why do teams continue to think they can beat @LFC with a high line? 10 men behind the ball, especially at Anfield, is the only way. #LIVROM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Banjalero Good thanks. You?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit Missing the point. We’re going round and round the same circle as a club and no one is saying this is stupid let’s try something else. It looked like we would when we appointed Keates but we’re still in the same place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wrexhamafc @Ap15606710 @dafyddpont Absolutely - thankfully you and others on the board understand that - and continue to work hard each day to move us forward.  Unfortunately 95% of our fanbase either thinks we do nothing wrong or everything wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbutler1978 @78Spirit Don’t bother. Everything the club does is perfect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Banjalero Lovely to see you talking about Phil like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ap15606710 @wrexhamafc @dafyddpont We also make mistakes along the way. Let’s not pin this solely on the players.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomecurran Reckon they’re going to trade him?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbutler1978 @gareth1864 We should have got a new man in who had 8 games to sort out the dross and ensure next season was thought about. I worry more may stay. We need someone ruthless and D&amp;D don’t strike me as such.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbutler1978 @gareth1864 The issue re. D&amp;D is not so much our form (although we’ve missed a great opportunity), it’s the things like retained lists and next season. We’re in big danger of being back at square one and wasting the progress made.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gareth1864 Agreed. We needed more quality in midfield in January but that area got worse. That can be fixed but I worry the decision to appoint D&amp;D could take us back to square 1.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gareth1864 Not disputing they were crap today but we haven’t got in the playoffs because the players bottled it. We’re not in the play offs because the Jan signings made us worse and we put an out of his depth manager in charge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gareth1864 Easy to blame the players. Two big errors... Keates’ midfield signings and appointing an interim manager. We’ll be paying the price of the latter for a while.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Oldjonah @BrynLaw @Wrexham_AFC Well we’ve been trying it for ten years now and it hasn’t worked once.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ohwhatagaz You support more teams than @CezDavis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Oldjonah @BrynLaw @Wrexham_AFC Well this season to season plan sure ain’t working either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WxmRob @OhBirkenhead 2 key errors:  1- Keates’ poor January window. 2- decision to employ interim manager.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrexhamDragons @DragonheartWxm It was hardly that. It was the equivalent of Wrexham coming in for us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarethPW Agreed. As you said, not having appointed a manager will compound that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarethPW Agreed. We blew it in January and when Keates left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Easy for @Wrexham_AFC fans to blame the players but ultimately decisions made at a higher level than that have cost us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@Wrexham_AFC going out with a whimper.  Waste of a season. We’ve dallied re. a new manager when we needed to be strong and bold.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Superb from the @cardiff_blues. Superb.  https://t.co/sTX2ovYpOr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ealinglevy Aren’t you a Jack?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good first half from the @cardiff_blues. Time to finish the job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DragonheartWxm Great podcast. Thought Boden and Sam were very honest. Andy Davies came across less well in my opinion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_steviejd_ @therealfootsie Good game last night Steve!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie @Trevla we getting on this again?  https://t.co/Egjice2eeV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y @therealfootsie You can laugh. Me and Foots will be tag teaming again this Thursday night! ⚽️⚽️⚽️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit Interesting points re. Davies &amp; Darlington missed two key points:  1) most people were glad to get rid of Wilkin so the squad didn’t need a lift.  2) Keates was part of that management group.   Still they are the board &amp; have to make the decisions. Easy for me to comment on here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit You piqued my interest so just listened. Thought Spencer made some great points re:  - the process they went through with Keates leaving. - structure of our contracts - they have a plan and they’re following it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thepaulwilliams He’s still got it in him though. He’s always got it in him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit On my list of podcasts to listen to on my commute this week. (Rarely get the chance on the weekend).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit Surely the issue isn’t someone stepping up from within?! The issue is the capability of that person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarryDaniels13 @GazTrow Not really the point when we’ll have a new manager next season who’ll want his own players and have his own philosophies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@88heapo @hdotjones @Wrexham_AFC It’s just life in an organisation. People at the top are accountable.  Rather than just blame the players because it’s easy I’d rather look at what we can do better at. I’m sure the board are doing the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@88heapo @hdotjones @Wrexham_AFC That doesn’t mean it was right. Hindsight is a wonderful thing but if you’re “in charge”, as the board are, the buck stops with you. Am sure they’ll learn from it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@88heapo @hdotjones @Wrexham_AFC Easy targets as they aren’t “us” in the same way Davies, Darlington and the board are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@88heapo @hdotjones @Wrexham_AFC You’re just as hysterical as those on Red Poison but on the other side.   The board are accountable for what’s looking like a mistake. Does this mean I want them sacked? No.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@88heapo @hdotjones @Wrexham_AFC While the hysteria is totally unnecessary, the board are ultimately accountable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GazTrow It’s not the same as seeing them in training etc.  Darling/Davies doing the retained list is a consequence of the approach you advocate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GazTrow It was a short term choice with no thought of implications. This is one of them. How can a new man make a decision on the retrained list? He’s not seen the team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GazTrow Another example of why appointing Davies as interim was a bad idea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 very impressive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrynLaw @fearlessidzine Should never have been put in that position.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fearlessidzine He deservedly is taking some heat. That said, he should never have been appointed in the first place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hdotjones @Wrexham_AFC A terrible appointment at the time the buzz a new manager would have given us could have propelled us further.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gethin_aj We’re in Philly for around 30 hours in a couple of weeks. What are the top things to do?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tickets booked for @cardiff_blues v Pau next Saturday. Hopefully a better result than the last European Semi final I watched them in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SEHarknessW Totally. ☹️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NatWest_Help How can other companies do it but you can’t?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NatWest_Help Poor though isn’t it LP?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NatWest_Help It’s from a Natwest account to a Natwest credit card. A Payment from Natwest to Barclaycard is done in two hours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NatWest_Help I make a payment to anyone else and it’s in their account instantly. I transfer money from my Natwest account to my Natwest credit card and it takes up to 5 days?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NatWest_Help How long does that take?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NatWest_Help why does it take so long for a payment to show on a credit card account?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @ohwhatagaz Neither easy nor rare.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ohwhatagaz You gave her the keys?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ohwhatagaz You must feel bad a lot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@colkop2 @richard_conway @AndrewRTDavies Indeed they are. I also appreciate that for all Liverpool fans this is an extremely emotive subject. That said, if the police were solely to blame for the disaster then terracing, in and of itself, is not the issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@colkop2 @richard_conway @AndrewRTDavies Other than extremely inaccurate initial conclusions made about the cause of the Hillsborough disaster, what are they?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@domwhite8 @bighumphs @richard_conway @AndrewRTDavies I just think how much worse Hillsborough would have been if there had been seats in the lower Leppings Lane. Issue was the police letting too many fans into the same area.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bonkers. Totally bonkers.  https://t.co/33jh683wVg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @dev2y Nearly funny. Not quite. You're just the gift that keeps on giving.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 you ok hun?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe us?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe That’s all you’ve got?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe You’d have done the same if Liverpool, Man Utd, Torquay, Stevenage it Shrewsbury had won.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 You managed to score. Was @jamskipotatoe in goals?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best fans in the world. 🙄  https://t.co/AB7JKWh09k<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie @thebarryhorns Memorable trip for a couple of reasons 1. It was my birthday on the day of the semi and 2. The Air BnB place with a feral cat, blood stains on the ceiling, bong holes on the sofa and cream coloured stains on the duvet!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebarryhorns @therealfootsie Yes we did! Great fun.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IanG1878 Whats not to like?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@streetfoodCDF And Monday?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@streetfoodCDF Are you open tomorrow or is today the last day?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @joneslee76 @only1Hollett That’s it?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joneslee76 @only1Hollett Only playing. We’ll start calling you @jamskipotatoe if you’re supporting two teams in the same division. He supports Liverpool and West Ham.  😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@only1Hollett He’s world class. Right @ScottWoodfield1?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joneslee76 @only1Hollett Thought you supported Villa?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @CardiffRugbyWeb The stuff they’ve done for @Wrexham_AFC has been awesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@krystaluk88 @anthonyfjoshua Nice!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cardiffcouncil where have all your taxis gone?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoStevensLabour @ToniaAntoniazzi Today @GWRHelp have sold tickets for carriages that don’t even exist. Chaos on the 12:08 from Paddington as there’s no coach J among others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now that’s comedy @therealfootsie 😂😂  https://t.co/TdphJ9P177<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla Ethiopian probably although the curry tonight was good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love London.   Eaten Indonesian, Lebanese, American, Mexican, Ethiopian and Venezuelan cuisine this week. #yum<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sat in @byronhamburgers in London. Turns out we’ve seen more of America than the Americans next to us.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wait til England get knocked out of the World Cup because of a VAR decision. Twitter will go meltdown. #ENGITA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Houghtie1 It’s actually pretty good. Great set too.  https://t.co/GyEnMxQfqz<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dev2y I know... easy to get 14 this week and that's with me out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Houghtie1 @thepaulwilliams Too small...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie we should do this tomorrow...  https://t.co/6AejlzX8Ub<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Andy_Wrex @ITV They make money on #SaturdayNightTakeaway - companies pay a lot of money to advertise on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit Not much. We stayed in London that whole weekend though. Mental that’s so long ago already.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never thought I’d be clearing snow off my car in mid March. 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ginge_1 You’re close enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ginge_1 They’ve been saying up to 20cms in the Valleys since Thursday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatsFanMatt @cpriceNFL Great book.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ginge_1 They’ve been saying for days we’d wake up to it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No #snow in Cardiff for 5 years, now we get it twice in a month.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NFLUK When are single game tickets on sale?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watched @paddingtonbear 2. What a great little movie. #Paddington2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was a terrible decision. He was not supporting his weight. #WALvFRA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@only1Hollett He’d been dreadful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis Pretty much.  He does play far too deep and kicks far too much though...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis Bit harsh on Biggar, David. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CardiffRugbyWeb @Bigt8409 It’s not even that good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis @PhilipSwann Biggar’s got our back line in reverse. No coincidence that’s it’s looked it’s best in the #6Nations when he hasn’t been on the pitch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhilipSwann @__davidlewis Two fair points.  Davies needs Patchell or Anscombe outside him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wonderful from France. Wonderful. #WALvFRA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have an outside centre who doesn’t understand the fundamentals of drawing the man then passing. #WALvFRA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And Biggar slows everything down. #WALvFRA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My namesake is a poor scrum half. Can’t pass or kick with any degree of accuracy. #WALvFRA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 Bounced over. That’s allowed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshowen555 @OfficialGHawke @rob_hawke They’d have gotten even more from Buffalo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billycoch @78Spirit Bang on. It's like one of the frothers on RP has got hold of 78's twitter handle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit No one knows that. Like we’d have done any differently it Wrexham can calling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mainzey7 @Bigt8409 @_steviejd_ Been to Anfield on Champions League night. YNWA was incredible. The rest, very underwhelming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Paskins_tache Obviously!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @_steviejd_ @Mainzey7 Even the Emirates would have an atmosphere at that point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @_steviejd_ Anfield’s atmosphere is a myth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit Guess it depends on if his boyhood club comes calling. I’d do the same if it were Wrexham.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlunInHope @BrynLaw @youngkilshaw It is a done deal by all accounts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jasonwxm1873 @keates12 @Wrexham_AFC Yes. Hopefully so. Frustrating but that’s football.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jasonwxm1873 @keates12 @Wrexham_AFC contracts just ensure the team who loses the manager/player gets compo. that's it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jasonwxm1873 @keates12 @Wrexham_AFC Contracts at any level in football aren't worth the paper they're written on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbutler1978 just made the mistake of going on Red Passion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@only1Hollett Nah, i'm watching from home!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis I’m sticking with #JobsForTheBoys plus we’re back to #warrenball.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheWelshDragon9 Probably right. However at least he hasn’t stolen a place like Liam Williams and Dan Biggar. Neither would be in for a form based side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How have Liam Williams and Dan Biggar kept their places? #JobsForTheBoys #WALvFRA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @Trevla @therealfootsie That’s his favourite tactic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @Trevla @therealfootsie Stop feeding the troll. He’s sat at home in his pants and bored.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @Bigt8409 @therealfootsie   https://t.co/HU2y1JFjrF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @danny_speck You’re from Ely. You don’t need any more toes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 @jamskipotatoe I’d be worried about not laughing at all if I was you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @ScottWoodfield1 I beat at least one of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @ScottWoodfield1 Called it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 Captain Flip flop will be here soon enough... @jamskipotatoe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheWelshDragon9 Anyone but biggar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brianmoore666 You’re bang on. We’ve been dreadful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drmarchant1 Agreed it wasn’t deliberately but you can’t hit the guys head. He did. Typical Williams. If only he had a brain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I was Gatland I’d sub Liam Williams after his sin bin. Stupid play. #WALvITA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheWelshDragon9 Really? Genuinely surprised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drmarchant1 He hit the guy’s head. The fact it was after the whistle makes it worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanG1878 If I was Gatland I’d be that annoyed with him I’d sub him after the 10 mins.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheWelshDragon9 For the scarlets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanG1878 It was a stupid tackle. We had penalty advantage. High, led with the shoulder and made contact with the head. No brainier for the ref.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheWelshDragon9 You’re so one eyed it’s funny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanG1878 Contact with the head. He’s lucky he’s not off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drmarchant1 Stupid tackle. ( another one from Williams).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y We could have got 11 of us from a Thursday night and beaten Chester.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @IanG1878 Captain Flip flop. Still laughing. 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanG1878 @jamskipotatoe Captain flip flop 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @ScottWoodfield1   https://t.co/kSzrxqBwa2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This would be such a French way to lose a game. #FRAvENG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheWelshDragon9 Foul play to stop a certain try.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanG1878 I'll be supporting England next week. This lot are the Liverpool of the 6N.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @thepaulwilliams The Wales team has the look of a Friday night Autumn International. Wales by 10 max.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheWelshDragon9 Really? It’s got a Friday Night autumn game with Fiji written all over it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie @MaskillS @DaleEvans_912 22 I make it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rosstyson @PodcastPeldroed @elisjames @paulmark77 @walesaway Agreed. Comes to every player eventually.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rosstyson @PodcastPeldroed @elisjames @paulmark77 @walesaway I love Ash but he’s not the player he was. That’s not excusing the idiots in our support who are relishing it but being a Welsh legend doesn’t make him immune from criticism either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @ScottWoodfield1 @jamskipotatoe @BBCSport love the way you're "Welsh" now we're not crap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fearlessidzine Disagree. If he’s an easy target it’s because he’s been poor. May as well give Ampadu some experience or alternatively go 4 at the back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fearlessidzine Nothing to do with scapegoating. He’s been a liability for Wales and Everton for the past 18 months. I’ll never forget all he’s given Wales fans but it’s time to move on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamgoman82 @cardiffcouncil It’ll be melted by the end of tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fearlessidzine Agree about BD but that was not a rare poor AW display. He’s not been at the races since the Euros.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @ScottWoodfield1 @BBCSport @CezDavis   https://t.co/Yc1hpdphd2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 @jamskipotatoe @BBCSport England are one of his teams at the World Cup. Don’t worry. He’s just like @CezDavis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gareth1864 @GriffinSpurs @TomiCaws @fearlessidzine Same number as have captained England to the same point...😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomiCaws @fearlessidzine @gareth1864 Nope. Unfortunately behaviour like that is the norm rather than the exception on twitter. ☹️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomiCaws @fearlessidzine @gareth1864 he may be a Welsh legend but he’s been poor since the Euros for both Wales and Everton.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dixiessixty You could be there until 2020.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit @Jasonwxm1873 He’s been poor since the Euros.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GriffinSpurs Can’t wait for England to be knocked out because of it. You know it’ll happen.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 it was on. didn't see the defender. if the ball had reached it's target we had a 2 on 1.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iesty83 it was on. he just didn't see the defender.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis we're not winning the tournament without a win here so no matter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unlucky... over him and they were in. #IREvWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhilipSwann he's been dreadful. Throughout.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The difference not having Biggar at 10 to this backline is stark. #IREvWAL #6Nations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>that's all on Biggar. #IREvWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What was Biggar doing then? #IREvWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanG1878 Although we've been dreadful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanG1878 Happens every game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thepaulwilliams Very cute by Cian Healy. Evans couldn't release the ball because the tackler was in the way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure why I'm astounded by such poor refereeing either. #IREvWAL #6nations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does our lack of skills still astound me? An outside centre should be able to pass the ball 15 meters without it going forward. #IREvWAL #6Nations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit @gareth1864 If we don’t go up, imagine how much easier it’ll be to sell us to potential players this summer than it was last.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darrenshorty5 @TheWelshDragon9 That’s why I can do nderstand halfpenny’s recall.   So much for playing open, attacking rugby. It was clearly a one game blip.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheWelshDragon9 Disagree on 7 but how Biggar is playing is beyond me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe I tell you what though, if Liverpool, Cardiff, Carlisle, Arsenal, Shrewsbury, celtic, Stevenage or Torquay lost out on silverware due to a poor decision that could have been fixed by VAR you’d be the first to moan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattyWebber88 I’ve always thought it was a two year job. Nothing has changed my view point. I’d have taken a top half finish if offered it in July.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattyWebber88 We’re way ahead of where I thought we’d be at this point.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Cyc1eguy @CDFCouncilFail @cardiffcouncil Disagree. Being stuck in the same traffic on a bus isn’t appealing at all. A 5 minute train journey from Central though...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cyc1eguy @CDFCouncilFail @cardiffcouncil I’d just take a decent public transport alternative to the east of the city. A station in Splott/roath and then Rumney would do wonders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rather than just prayers and condolences, why not do something to stop people who shouldn’t have guns having them.  https://t.co/hzKJ18rxPV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing quite like #Cardiff rush hour traffic. When will @cardiffcouncil improve transport infrastructure especially in the east of the the city?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanG1878 Depends. Most days A. Today is B.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gareth1864 Least they’re looking for this to end for large away supports from next season.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 The Eagles were awesome offensively last night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Incredible game. Absolutely incredible game. Well done @Eagles. #BBCNFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@metroplexboston Gronk didn’t play last year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 It’s not been that good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_steviejd_ Pretty much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@OsiUmenyiora never a clean hit. Helmet to helmet. #bbcnfl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_steviejd_ It’s a great game. Love it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on Tom... time for number 6. #notdone #gopats  https://t.co/HWDNmPtacV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theblitzdefence Especially as this is the 2nd time they’ve done it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichardHThomas1 @Bigt8409 @thepaulwilliams No issue with Biggar per se. His skillset is not what’s needed for open attacking rugby. It’s no coincidence that generally we look more threatening with Priestland or Patchell at 10.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@The_Goat9 @wayne_1603 @scarlets_rugby A Scottish team that should have beaten NZ and hammered Australia...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @bakke171 Leeds playing Liverpool?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @thepaulwilliams Bigger prevents wales playing like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Same old Scotland. Talk it up after a good Autumn Series and then can't back it up in the #6Nations. Totally outclassed today. #WALvSCO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love @AndyNic9 - making @JiffyRugby look impartial since 2002. #WALvSCO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Wales have finally decided to follow the @scarlets_rugby blue print. #WALvSCO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 Got the dvds? Or is it on Netflix etc?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@drmarchant1 We’ll never see this greatness again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanG1878 Not to mention #tb12. Both were incredible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brady did that without @Edelman11 and @RobGronkowski. @DannyAmendola stepped up big time. #notdone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a game. One for the ages #tb12.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But Tom Brady is a system quarterback.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The @Jaguars are more physical and quicker on every single play.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Trevla @Bigt8409 Ref was superb. Actually reffed the breakdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fearlessidzine @78Spirit Carl Robinson would be my preferred choice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@surrexeras Agreed. It was a great game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesvobrien They do but we’re capable of that. All about line speed and pressure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@AndyNic9 - making Jonathan Davies look balanced and not biased since 2001. #SCOvNZL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unlucky Scotland. That’s the blueprint we must follow next Saturday. Hopefully Barnes will be as equally a fair referee. #SCOvNZL #WALvNZL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeLedleysBeard one of the better options.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realMChalmers it can't be said Scotland don't deserve that. Referee is having a great game. Allowing you to compete.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realMChalmers hope they prove me wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This could get brutal. First half looks to have taken it out of Scotland. Making more errors and not the same work at the breakdown. #SCOvNZL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s not a yellow card. Completely accidental. #SCOvNZL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis Heard about how poor it was.  The gap between NZ and everyone else is exacerbated by poor refereeing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amazing how normal the All Blacks look when you have a referee who’s prepared to referee the breakdown properly. #SCOvNZL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@towzer31 @TheWelshDragon9 If we hadn’t lost all 4 games in the autumn we’d have been ok. We experimented in the 4th game and lost.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@caz_mar @GriffDavies 😳  https://t.co/FKzZaRDWuH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 Hightower is a huge loss. Guess we’ll see how they cope tomorrow. But much improved as you say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 When you add it to the chip every Welshman has on each shoulder...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 Years of every English footballing generation being “golden” has soured me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hopefully they’ll do as well as previous “golden generations”.  https://t.co/1OB3FOteYp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y Congratulations pal!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @ArrivaTW It’s terrible customer service. Almost as if they don’t want customers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @ArrivaTW It’s on its way...  https://t.co/B6B89E9VLu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie you didn’t say you went...😂😂  https://t.co/URYxl5dhQA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PodcastPeldroed A good pod, as always.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JumboHart Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samwood2345 He’s overrated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie Yep. That’s how they knew each other!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie He was friends with my old man back in the day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomecurran I could take them 96 yards v this D.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PdxInteractive Tried signing up for your website. Keeps looping back to sign up page with no notification of what the issue is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y @therealfootsie @bakke171 @MB_LDNM @LDN_Muscle @lazarouleague Better hope you’re on my team then!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattCarrel @bakke171 @therealfootsie Guess which side gets those? 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bakke171 @therealfootsie @lazarouleague Thanking you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie @bakke171 @MB_LDNM @LDN_Muscle @lazarouleague Two please<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@7puzzle @PodcastPeldroed If that Bale shot had gone in we’d have been in the playoffs. Fine margins.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PodcastPeldroed He doesn’t control if Bale gets injured with his club. That said, he could have done better with tactics esp on Monday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PodcastPeldroed 1) how can he prevent this? 2) not sure we have the players currently to combat it but think he could do better at times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PodcastPeldroed Two main issues: 1- Euro 2016 hangover. 2- we only had Bale, Ramsay and Allen on the pitch together for 3 of the 10 games.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Say what you want about the Irish tactics and the referee but we weren’t good enough tonight.  This however... #togetherstronger #WALIRE  https://t.co/cZIxC1XfiP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ireland are like watching 1980s Wimbledon. #WALIRE #togetherstronger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theDaveThomas82 @MaskillS  https://t.co/giYRUT0xBW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’d be better on a knackered acl than Cutler. #nfl #Dolphins  https://t.co/zS1MNDvoRX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaskillS @theDaveThomas82 @VP They’ll all fall for it though!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlunInHope @My_Racecourse yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlunInHope @My_Racecourse I'll be 5 rows back in the main stand. can't wait.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlunInHope @My_Racecourse Do you do all the pics away as well? I saw you at Torquay I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlunInHope @My_Racecourse Yes. before kick off. Next time I'll take one when we're shooting towards the GUS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimonThomasAC There was one proudly flown at the @My_Racecourse today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesJennings03 Well worth the drive up from Cardiff!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some improvement in the 2nd half. Deserved win for #WxmAFC. Moving @MPKelly11 to the centre changed the game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hdotjones @Wrexham_AFC Rutherford isn’t the issue. The ball has gone out wide far quicker since Kelly went in the middle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikehughescq @Wrexham_AFC Pretty much sums it up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikehughescq @Wrexham_AFC Dreadful, isn’t it?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fearlessidzine Looked like a dive from the MRS too.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie @Darrenshorty5 @_steviejd_ @ed_brown33 Nor me pal. Going to be rocking!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a goal. #geowal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Based on most tournaments @England are in, they'll only need from the 14th June - 28th at most. #ENGSLO #Russia2018  https://t.co/iBjr2EviNI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe i'm not going to shout at you. don't worry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe an England win is good for us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe cant watch them for that reason.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @ArrivaTW   https://t.co/Olu98IwdRb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will @Number10gov also cap prices in insurance industries etc? Bonkers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattyWebber88 3 points off top at this stage of the season? We’d have taken that with a striker in August.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@yesacuiby @UKLabour Agreed. Unfortunately I think we're going to have to go through that for people to see it for the farce it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dixiessixty He's dreadful. For Everton and Wales.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JumboHart That schedule was far easier last year though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbutler1978 I saw the one who wasn't called up yesterday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie you coming pal?  https://t.co/KGSDUnGV2I<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MattCarrel @jamskipotatoe No. @matt_paz17 has "volunteered" to help.   Plus, no one knows where @jamskipotatoe is. #AWOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice to switch off from work until Monday. Laptop left in the office, phone turned off. Time to chill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robertsnell7 @Reid_Rothschild @AlbertBreer They didn't do Manning any good. 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 That'll come. D always takes a few weeks to get going. Hightower returning will be massive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 Correct. And people doubt he's the greatest ever!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 He's getting better not worse. Last drive was insane<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @NFLGamePassEU First year in 5 I haven't bothered with gamepass. Glad I didn't.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie not a bad away following!!!  https://t.co/nQc9mz33Ry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They obviously weren't including Roath and Adamsdown. @JoStevensLabour  https://t.co/EiyBEht0bt<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@capaled1991 They are a good team<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@capaled1991 @Gridiron @famerica patriots. Bad start to the season.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie @JordanGPrice 😂😂  https://t.co/zsmxEff4tJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gridiron If we put a team together we'd stick at least 30 on the #colts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So much for Rodgers never throwing interceptions. 🙄 #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanG1878 @ScottWoodfield1 @MattCarrel Its operation pretend I support Cardiff so they don't think I support Liverpool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @IanG1878 @MichaelMooney92 They're number 1 in your eyes. No doubt about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @IanG1878 @MichaelMooney92 Jamo... you chirp a lot in favour of Liverpool considering you don't support them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neilreynoldsnfl @85WORLDCHAMPS @SolomonsWisdom @AroundTheNFL @SI_PeterKing Why the Browns v Steelers game and not the Titans v Raiders one? That's the question on everyone's lips.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@99jgw @LeaderRich @Wrexham_AFC Sums it up. Two points dropped.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just finished #Hinterland. Great Welsh TV drama.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y Maybe back in the 1980s. A definite red card today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y If there's one thing better than you lot losing, its you lot losing with a sense of injustice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hoping for a good @Wrexham_AFC result at Torquay. #WxmAFC  https://t.co/5yQ3LIObSW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rhodrielisjones @Wrexham_AFC Likewise!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rhodrielisjones Where are they playing? Off to Torquay later to watch @Wrexham_AFC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeaderRich @Wrexham_AFC 5 of us from Cardiff coming down tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So glad I didnt get up to watch that. #patriots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @Bigt8409 @j_fychan Always said the best time to play the pats is September. I even had them down to lose tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fearlessidzine @Garybenno7 @WrexhamProgs My favourite @Wrexham_AFC player ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 If the Patriots click they'll win at a canter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 What you reckon?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 NFL fantasy is really good. You get to draft. Think they may lose tonight. Sept always a good time to play Pats and Kansas are a good team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 @Gridiron @famerica Yep. In a work league. You?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 @jamskipotatoe I'd have stopped after football Scott.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 Prepare yourself for it. It'll only make the inevitable less painful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darrenshorty5 Explains why he was so bad against Liverpool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm already resigned to this happening. #TogetherStronger  https://t.co/RTrryHp4HJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has Ramsay managed to pass to anyone else in yellow over the last 20 mins?! #MDAWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why have we stopped crossing the ball since we've put Vokes on?! #MDAWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That should have been a penalty on Bale. #MDAWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis Course we won't. They're the rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can someone explain to the @SkySports commentators that Ireland losing is not good for Wales. #MDAWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Allen, on the other hand, has been great. #MDAWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In games like this you need your stars to step up. Ramsay and Bale far from doing that so far. #MDAWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was there another date after this?   https://t.co/Q8tKWW7MYy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@filhughes @neilreynoldsnfl @Jeff_Reinebold Yes they are. It's on twice beforehand. No news of Do your job 2 though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daihankey @aberconference They should change the history trip for a Hinterland tour!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #hinterland this late is not a good idea. #onedge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeLedleysBeard Look at the faces Gunter and Richards are pulling. 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bonkers. Get better every time I watch it.  https://t.co/uyQKOOFFwl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @theDaveThomas82 Schmeichel, maldini, gascoinge and Ronaldo (providing he's been off the burgers)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @theDaveThomas82 Only row that's hard is D and that's because of bergkamp/zidane<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @WayneRooney @SkySportsNews Now that's funny!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mybosstime Toss a coin...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll take the credit after my tweet yesterday. #amazingdoughnuts  https://t.co/PF8Mg2Bwr1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PodcastPeldroed I was talking about the "Joe who?" comment not any criticism of Edwards.  https://t.co/BLNSap9fqG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PodcastPeldroed @_DaveEdwards You weren't saying that at half time. 😉  Edwards best game in a Wales shirt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People like me?! First time I've tweeted about you. You carry on doing your own thing of spending more on wages than most Nat League clubs.  https://t.co/tKXUwLVeuf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @BenWoodburn He plays for your favourite club. Good choice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fair dos to Chris Coleman for changing formation and personnel at half time. Much better 2nd half and a deserved win. #walaus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tada1973 @paulmwrexham I figured that. It's the other nauseating responses where people just have a pop at RP for nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tada1973 @paulmwrexham Same question also on Spirit board I believe. Same person posted both.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Joe Allen is what wrong with Wales tonight. Badly missed in that midfield so far. #walaus<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really don't get @TheNonLeagueMag and @BBCSport's obsession with the likes of @BTFC &amp; @SalfordCityFC. They're bad for non league football.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>By my calculations the mighty @Wrexham_AFC are up to third. #WxmAFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>£2 entry fee well worth it.  https://t.co/DeHjpJdL5d<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Deal!!  https://t.co/qOSjsogWy5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@streetfoodCDF is there a limit on how often we can come during Sept? 😂😂These doughnuts from @theearlybird_uk were insane.  https://t.co/JrkedqvZnm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@streetfoodCDF En route.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time to go and see what @streetfoodCDF is all about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie @wayne_1603 @Trevla Not Wayne...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavyPaul @brinning_ @virginmedia And in CF24!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y @ChattieBoy @GWRHelp If ever he writes an autobiography, that's the title.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavyPaul @virginmedia Thanks. Just tried that in CF24 and have the same fault. Least I know it's likely a fault and not my router.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PritchardSJP @virginmedia Been like this in Cardiff too!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChattieBoy @GWRHelp How can you feel sick going backwards on a train?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@virginmedia are you having any problems with your wifi in Cardiff?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattCarrel @kopdragon told you he had nothing upstairs.  https://t.co/V8iN4FXWpE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbutler1978 Agreed but I always thought this was a 2 year job. Spine of the team is there to just add one or two to next season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't believe this is 25 years ago. #WxmAFC  https://t.co/VhCNa3iMFr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamRConnah I'd be a better signing than the Ox.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He'd miss from 2 yards out with an open goal though. #WALAUT  https://t.co/2Ni4IUAlQ8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GriffDavies 7th. Everton will be above them as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MediaTeamWAFC @Tada1973 @m_griffiths92 You have a final whistle podcast?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dev2y @Trevla @therealfootsie #moves!!  We've got a ticket going spare for the NFL on 1st October if you fancy it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y @MattCarrel Ok. let me know when you hear from him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y @MattCarrel you're like the Arsenal of 4 or 5 years ago not this rabble. Capable of ripping any team apart but can't defend for toffee.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattCarrel @dev2y just calling it as I see it... you're turning into the new Arsenal. (They've turned into Brighton).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y @MattCarrel and if he doesn't get one you'll continue to fall into the trap of previous seasons of struggling to beat teams who defend &amp; counter attack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bakke171 @dev2y Missed you this week Reg, though @therealfootsie took over the falling over duties.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fearlessidzine @FAWales Living down here has been fun so far this season. 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y Some have more than others. Yes please pal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lots of @CardiffCityFC "supporters" coming out of the woodwork. Where were you all last season?! #fairweather<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MR51CUK @Wrexham_AFC @fezbob @wrexham It made me laugh when I saw it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MR51CUK @Wrexham_AFC @fezbob @wrexham Serves you right for having such a posh car!! 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AW15_ The money is obscene. That's why I prefer watching @Wrexham_AFC any day of the week. Much more community minded etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AW15_ That doesn't even make the top 5 of reasons to dislike modern football. I get more disengaged with the @premierleague each season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This will be #TB12's motivation for number 6. #patriots can still win.  https://t.co/rhdHiVk64o<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@theDaveThomas82 @CezDavis These puns are making my skin crawl.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DMR1864 @gareth1864 @billycoch @GZanellan @78Spirit @BarryDaniels13 @fearlessidzine And this is the crux of it. He's not playing the role we need him to as he's not been asked to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 @jamskipotatoe Don't talk about his nose like that. He has some feelings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @ScottWoodfield1 Actually it's a full on chomp...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @ScottWoodfield1 I believe we're getting a bite!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @ScottWoodfield1 You just forgot to talk about them when they were crap?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @ScottWoodfield1 Don't think I've heard you talk about Cardiff for like 3 seasons... #whodoyousupport?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbutler1978 This ones on the WG. Agreed a contract with no groth factored in.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GarethParry @fearlessidzine @tonywhilding88 I didn't say you did. Just stating that it shouldn't have not been given because the shot happened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarethParry @fearlessidzine @tonywhilding88 That's not a reason not to give the penalty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BartonBank @tunein Don't get your hopes up!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MediaTeamWAFC @CommentaryWAFC Really bad feedback/noise on the commentary. Low pitch buzzing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCP_14_ They only lost 4. Also beat Leeds and FGR in the cup.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCP_14_ I'd ban them because they give home teams a significant advantage. Either all use them or none.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@82timcarter Can't wait. There's a few of us down here who like it and we all support different teams.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@82timcarter You should want to play the patriots. You have a hex over us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@82timcarter You support the Giants?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 @Gridiron @NFLUK why would you want to see your team lose Scott? I suppose you're used to it by now...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The look on one of the players faces says it all... at least she tried.  https://t.co/YNERb2DpYC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@christiaanjv1 @IanG1878 Should have been a penalty to the Lions. Reed was  virtually on the 10 yard line when they kicked off.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IanG1878 What I don't understand is why they're all so prickly about Everton spending so much money... it's like they've never spent any!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanG1878 Liverpool fan again I see...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 100% a success. Scratch team with 4 weeks prep draw with the best team on the planet by a country mile.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bcarswell @82timcarter @jamessercombe Awesome series. Shame the next one isn't for 4 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seimon76 @Bigt8409 He told him it was accidental. Big credit to SW in getting it changed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bcarswell @82timcarter @jamessercombe It was offside. It was accidental. Therefore it's accidental offside.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@82timcarter @jamessercombe @bcarswell Great captaincy from Warburton talking Poite into the scrum. (Which incidently was the correct decision).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 @jamskipotatoe   https://t.co/opvK3gt9zs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darktaff Murray brings much to a team. Quick and accurate passing is not one of them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darktaff Your eyesight has got no better over the years...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Conor Murray's passing is reminiscent of Mike Phillips' in his prime. #LionsNZ2017 #NZLvBIL3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sam_a_liu Are you really surprised?! I present Wales 2014-2017 as my evidence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samwood2345 Don't get defensive now... he's been dreadful.  He was hardly the match winner last week either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sam Warburton. #LionsNZ2017 #NZLvBIL3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why aren't we leathering this ball into their half?! #LionsNZ2017 #NZLvBIL3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4 huge mistakes in the first 20 minutes. #LionsNZ2017 #NZLvBIL3  https://t.co/ndfjF70YXj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Biggest issue is poor play by the Lions. 2 turnovers wasted and an 80m interception that eventually led to a try. #lionsnz2017  https://t.co/ysZ3au14Uh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sam_a_liu What's up with Owen Farrell? Cost us two turnovers and a try.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Farrell is having a nightmare. Two turnovers he's wasted. #LionsNZ2017 #NZLvBIL3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 Two turnovers by Warburton already.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sam_a_liu That was never a penalty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How on earth is that a penalty?! This is going to be hard enough without Poite giving NZ everything at ruck time. #lionsnz2017 #NZLvBIL3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrdanwalker Has he ever gone anything else?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think this may be a step too far for the Lions but Gatland's teams tend to peak at the right time. #LionsNZ2017 #NZvsBIL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hard to believe this was a year ago... not many can say they saw their country in the SF of a major football tournament on their birthday.  https://t.co/7jMbRYsITF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 They wouldn't. You're right. Which is probably a reason why GT said no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @kopdragon @matt_paz17 @dev2y @R_Hennessy @murph_stephen Got to love Jamo. Master tactician and man motivator rolled into one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 Fair comment but it's no good them all moaning when they weren't involved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If their coaches had got involved it would have been different. No voice in selection meetings.  https://t.co/sMxVodvMi2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @ScottWoodfield1 @IanG1878 Brace? He's not strapped to my teeth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y Up to 13 on a Monday...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis Thanks for the ticket...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbutler1978 My favourite one it's all about making money... because no football tournament is about making money...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chris_Trues @thepaulwilliams SOB and Warburton were the best two players on the pitch. Immense. Huge difference at the breakdown today. Ijote also v.good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @talkSPORT2 Can't remember now. Only players they mentioned were Ijote and Farrell. Thought SW/SOB were out of this world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 Best two players on the park. @talkSPORT2 saying Ijote MOM though... 😳🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You don't half tweet about the Lions &amp; the egg considering your dislike of both.  https://t.co/9JaJAa0esp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great interview and attitude from @samwarburton_. #NZvBIL #Lionsnz2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes... but is anyone really that surprised?? #NZvBIL #LionsNZ2017  https://t.co/UqJEKrj0M4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ijote and Vunipola are penalty machines. #NZvBIL #LionsNZ2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It looks like the Lions are down to 14 not NZ. #NZvsBIL #LionsNZ2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis They need to play the game at the other end of the pitch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darrenshorty5 A NZ player hadn't been sent off in my lifetime before that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanG1878 The poor kick was what started it. We just need to play the game in their half.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thomasbear1972 Indeed. Chill out. Play the percentages.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samwood2345 Peyper tried to talk him out of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Goodbye SBW. #NZvBIL #LionsNZ2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Should be a red card. Won't be but should be. #NZvBIL #LionsNZ2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amazed the ABs haven't sent SBW down Sexton's channel. #NZvBIL #LionsNZ2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was never a penalty. NZ TH lost his footing. #NZvBIL #LionsNZ2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samwood2345 SBW will have broken Sexton by 20 mins...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamessercombe Didn't you fancy it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samwood2345 Nor me. Mental selection for this morning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope I'm wrong but NZ by 20. #NZvBIL #LionsNZ2017<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis @realMChalmers You have to ask if anyone who thinks Farrell is a worse defender than Sexton has ever watched a game of rugby.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis @realMChalmers IMO, the game plan was the correct one but didn't have the right personnel, particularly up front.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis @realMChalmers Take out the 3 individual errors that gifted the ABs tries and it's a close game. Add in the chances we missed it's game on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realMChalmers this makes the decision even crazier.  https://t.co/3Q8AENZYLY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @bakke171 @dev2y @thatphillad It was funnier than when @kopdragon went down in instalments one week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 Barry looks lush.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisleech03 @thepaulwilliams Sexton is the only change in that backline. Huge worry about SBW running down that channel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 @bcarswell @realMChalmers @82timcarter @sam_a_liu No sleep being lost. Just a crazy selection. Very unGatland like. Hope they pull it out of the bag on Saturday morning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drmarchant1 @ben_keen86 @bcarswell @realMChalmers @82timcarter @sam_a_liu Pretty much. Rather than the one that was still in it with 25 to go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DRThomas91 @sam_a_liu @realMChalmers @82timcarter That tour was the worst ever. This could push it close.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bcarswell @ben_keen86 @realMChalmers @82timcarter @sam_a_liu The team makes no sense. How is AWJ still at 5? Sexton should be behind Biggar in the 10 rankings let alone starting and no Teo?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thepaulwilliams It's a back line that will be smashed by the ABs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@82timcarter @sam_a_liu @realMChalmers Not sure how AWJ is still in nor why Teo was dropped. Sexton at 10 is an unnecessary and undeserved change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sam_a_liu @realMChalmers  @82timcarter potentially one of the worst Lions teams I've ever seen. NZ by 20+.  https://t.co/1zogGDdX8m<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Tada1973 @wrexhamafc @marcvjones @GS_WAFC @Wrexham_AFC If only the council would wake up to this...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's got nothing to do with it being a scratch team. It's because it's British.  https://t.co/Zxyg5fK5MI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbutler1978 and here's the real issue... it's British.  https://t.co/mKc0YIxCdq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PodcastPeldroed That is such a warped view of the 2005 Lions tour. The game had moved on and he hadn't. Much like Gatland in 2017.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂😂 he ran the worst Lions tour in living memory.  Many would argue England were so good at the time inspite of him, not because of him.  https://t.co/jrMOlyUnHE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rhodrielisjones Many don't see it like that. Would be interesting to see what people would watch if both games at the same time. I'd be Wales but most not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The irony... with everything that's happened at FIFA over the past few years...  https://t.co/CcG4KWM7VX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you think professional elite sport exists other than for revenue?! Like it or not, it's a business.  https://t.co/6uTKX8c7dF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 I think he'll keep TF. Question is whether he moves O'Brien to 6 or brings in someone like Stander. I'd play Webb too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 That is true but Sexton is a liability. Massive game Tuesday for some to play themselves into the team for Saturday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 I'd bring in SW at 7 and change both locks. Also Webb in for Murray. Would also drop Sexton and 1/2p from bench.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 It's hard as a lot of the squad aren't exactly in form. Based solely on this morning you could argue changing from no 3 all way to no 9.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 Picking that back 3 wasn't very Gatland. He also changed 5 after 1st test in 2013.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 I disagree. Think there'll be a number of changes especially in the pack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rhodrielisjones You made out that you had to be Welsh or British. It's possible and ok to be Welsh, British, European and internationalist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 Agree. Will be interesting to see where he goes. Once Teo came off we were nowhere near getting over the gain line from non turnover ball.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Warrenball is on its way back folks... #lionsnz2017  https://t.co/8eENOblRc8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drmarchant1 @daihankey @bcarswell I'd keep SOB - we need dynamic ball carriers. I'd think of changing both locks for the same reason.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rhodrielisjones Shame there's no room for both Welsh and British in your eyes.  It was difficult to comment on the Welsh game yesterday as I was in work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daihankey @bcarswell Front 5 were poor which made being a backrower difficult. I think Warbs will be in for 2nd test. We failed to slow down their ball.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@82timcarter @jamessercombe @bcarswell SBW charging at Sexton fills me with dread.   We need a proper 7. I'd change both locks and put in Sinckler and Webb.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@82timcarter @jamessercombe @bcarswell Exactly!! 👍👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamessercombe @bcarswell I say we give up and go home...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The good and bad of Liam Williams. #BILvNZ #LionsNZ2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely nothing wrong with that tackle. #BILvNZ #LionsNZ2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 He's still got a brain fart in him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That All-Blacks try was poor defending. Not great skill. Daly was nowhere near where he should have been. #bilvnz #lionsnz2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a try. #BILvNZ #LionsNZ2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamessercombe My prediction was for the first quarter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're missing what Warburton brings to the team. #BILvNZ #LionsNZ2017  https://t.co/SNKnDNOnEl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was terrible defence. #BILvNZ #LionsNZ2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samwood2345 I wouldn't have started him either but we're missing Warburton at the ruck. Too many stupid errors too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was thinking the Lions could pinch this and then saw Peyper was reffing. NZ by 10. #BILvNZ #LionsNZ2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This would hold more weight if people had actually managed to pick players in the right positions...  https://t.co/KkCcKuLymo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @CezDavis @IanG1878 I love your reaction every time... like a book.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ggrfc_girls @ginge_1 It's virtually blowing a gale down in Cardiff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @CezDavis @IanG1878 Or the last one you posted about Liverpool/Man United/Cardiff/Arsenal/Swansea... etc etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gowenmedia I was there in December. There are no words.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrynLaw @BarryDaniels13 @lesley4wrexham Even though the WAG aren't spending on the Cardiff arena... Bigger issue is WCBC. Sort out a proposal that the WG can get behind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is a breeze people... there is a breeze. #meltover #coolingdown #heatwaveuk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 @lionsofficial Amazed they haven't gone with 1/2p with the weather that's forecast. Williams is the best 15 in that squad though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 @lionsofficial Very surprised by 1/2p. North has been dreadful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@lionsofficial team... Wow. #LionsNZ2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @dev2y Bang on. Would have had 14 but 7 refused to play with Jamo...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gareth1864 Amazing what can happen though when the club comes up with a proposal with their council.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y no football pal. Only had 7.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 They are deluded. Means they get to play European games there though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattyWebber88 @Wrexham_AFC Same answer isn't it?! Take the first step and make a proposal. Of course the Plaid guy already knows that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#FirstGifComesUpForYourName reminds me of @therealfootsie on Thursday nights.  https://t.co/ol6lbKjYSx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 @Trevla He's overrated. See Wal v Ire in the 6N to see a proper back row sort him out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MazzyK @BartonBank Do we know the first two aren't true?   The last point would seem clear cut based on what he's just done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@82timcarter @bcarswell @jamessercombe @realMChalmers @sam_a_liu Choice is between Ijote and AWJ. Kruis was nailed on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@82timcarter @bcarswell @jamessercombe @realMChalmers @sam_a_liu I don't rate Cole at all. Gives away a lot of penalties.   I think the only positions Gats would have found hard were 4 and 7.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mikehughescq @Wrexham_AFC My guess is the WAG see our stadium as a different issue to this arena. I think I'd agree with that standpoint.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikehughescq @Wrexham_AFC Summer gigs I can see working not sure an indoor arena of that size works all year round. Agree about Wrexham stadium.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikehughescq Genuine question, is a 10,000-15,000 seat arena viable in  https://t.co/HkAXJtxrKn? Not sure it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y Legend...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ByronFlynn1949 Agree. Game has moved on and we haven't. It's not like the players aren't capable - look at the Scarlets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ByronFlynn1949 Well we're certainly not getting better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ByronFlynn1949 5th Nov 2016. Also managed it in 2014 and 2013...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CezDavis You drive on a dual carriageway every time you pass work you plum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 I agree. I think Gatland has got it wrong big time but the way some are carrying on you'd think it'd never happened before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those English outcrying re. the #LionsNZ2017 call ups obviously don't remember 2005. Let's not pretend Gatland is the first...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 @bcarswell @82timcarter @realMChalmers Agreed but Wales have been dreadful offensively for years. Had Wales been good then I might have given him the benefit of the doubt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bcarswell @82timcarter @realMChalmers Howley. Although I'm not sure he knows anything about attacking or coaching.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They'll still put 30 points on Wales in November.  https://t.co/fqWUGI2cEr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@SkySportsRugby is there really any doubt 1/2p should be starting fullback?  #LionsNZ2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sam_a_liu I'm saving this tweet for when they win next weekend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ajstret The two Irish boys should start. Whether they will or not is another matter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@82timcarter @realMChalmers @bcarswell It'll be a lot closer than people think next week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the bench. #LionsNZ2017  https://t.co/MYW8Yr5Ebp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@82timcarter @realMChalmers @bcarswell Great result for Scotland.   Pack have been good most games. Worry is backs still look pedestrian.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Correct. Should have been red. Shoulder to the head. #LionsNZ2017  https://t.co/hiwQwqmUEh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 Should have been a red.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis @ben_keen86 @jcorrigangolf They'll play midweek. We'll see two separated squad from tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That should be a red. Shoulder to the head. #MABvBIL #LionsNZ2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not like the All Blacks to take out a key opposition player.  #MABvBIL #LionsNZ2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 He'll probably adjust better than you!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 Wow. That'll be a good trip.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 @__davidlewis @jcorrigangolf It enables Gatland to have none of the test squad involved on Tuesday. Whether they are the right players is another matter...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 Exciting. How long you out there for?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 When do you go out now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@only1Hollett @lionsofficial Agreed. It's was 1/2ps ball every time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@only1Hollett @lionsofficial He told him not to kick it dead. As it would have been a scrum 5 to the Maoris.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 No idea but they should still know. Sums up British rugby. Zero situational awareness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How can the @lionsofficial not know the rules?!  #MABvBIL #LionsNZ2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ryan_whiteman I've got a better pass than my namesake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You'd never guess this was a team being coached by Gatland and Howley. 😳 #MABvBIL #LionsNZ2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 @sam_a_liu @WestWingWeekly We loved that episode too.  We're up to the John Spencer one. As good as everyone says Sam?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sam_a_liu @ben_keen86 See this is where being Welsh is good. No tension as you know you'll lose to a last minute try.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 @sam_a_liu Hard enough touring there with your full team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sam_a_liu @ben_keen86 What's the score??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis Got Indiana Jones on. Much better viewing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Having 283 diamonds on their #SB51 rings is top trolling even by the @patriots standards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's also removes some of the psychological advantage the All Blacks gain from it if the Haka is performed at each game. #LionsNZ2017  https://t.co/RKdWuhfkTz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @GreggsOfficial #winning indeed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackoRugby He's going 1/2p there all day. Especially while Farrell is missing at least one kick per game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drmarchant1 Me too. But Gatland will pick him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gareth1864 8, 9 and 10 nailed on barring injury.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drmarchant1 I agree. Him on one wing and North on the other.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gatland always goes back to tried and tested. Seen nothing to suggest 1/2p won't be test full back. #LionsNZ2017  https://t.co/hki9HdFdW9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryMahon26 He's not nailed on there. Will be very surprised if Gatland doesn't pick Faletau at 8.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarryMahon26 Stander will be 6.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenWebbORourke 8,9,10 nailed on... so much competition elsewhere it's still up for grabs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Um... Faletau?! #LionsNZ2017  https://t.co/77oXbTPOmL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndBethHadley If only. The quicker they get Stephen Jones in the Welsh set up the better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndBethHadley The attack has the look of Howley all over it. Not sure if it'll get any better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mclaren0101 Gatland will pick him. No doubt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 He's the best 10 on tour by miles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Halfpenny will be kicking in the tests. #CRUvBIL #LionsNZ2017  https://t.co/EXz0j9vYHF<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ginge_1 If that exit poll is right it's going to be chaos.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Trevla Which one?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sexton's poor kicking has resulted in two tries. #BLUvBIL #LionsNZ2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samhunt__ We won that 10 mins 3-0 you clown. 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redmanpe Not many from any country have played well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is why Halfpenny will be the test 15. #lionsnz2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@redmanpe Thought we were all British for the Lions?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's called the "Howley effect". #lionsnz2017  https://t.co/LAR5ajaaYZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jtsayers @h1ppies Nowell looks out of his depth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@h1ppies Sexton has been no better. Maybe it's the game plan. Just a thought. Howley is the issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@h1ppies Yes. We're losing tonight because of the Welsh. #lionsnz2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@82timcarter @bcarswell @realMChalmers @jamessercombe 35 mins. Blues just missed another try with a foot in touch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla He got lucky there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@82timcarter @bcarswell @realMChalmers @jamessercombe He'd probably be a step up from Biggar or Sexton.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bcarswell @82timcarter @realMChalmers @jamessercombe Webb is the quickest of the 3 9s we have.   Sexton is on. We literally have zero chance if Farrell gets injured.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla Yes. That try stemmed from a dreadful kick by Sexton.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@82timcarter @bcarswell @realMChalmers @jamessercombe Webb and Ijote have been the best two for the Lions. Lawes has good moments but gives always stupid penalties.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla He won't be near a test shirt. Don't worry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@82timcarter @bcarswell @realMChalmers @jamessercombe 12-10 to Blues at HT. real mixed bag from Lions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a try. Off Nowell. #BLUvBIL #LionsNZ2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mclaren0101 Indeed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What on earth was Biggar doing then?! #BLUvBIL #LionsNZ2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArthurGoddard13 Stander isn't even the best 6 in the squad let alone the best 8. #LionsNZ2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HYPRSPORT Haha. He never changes his tactics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No. The Lions look like Wales in attack. #BLUvBIL #LionsNZ2017  https://t.co/dOIIBCZGQC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mclaren0101 Not sure what your obsession with North is. He's not even playing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sam_a_liu Haha. There is no way Gatland picks Hogg over him. No way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sam_a_liu 1/2p will be test 15. Have no doubt of that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>He's agreeing with himself...  https://t.co/xq63qdD5hQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darrenshorty5 I'm all good. Black bits everywhere mind. 😃😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattCarrel @jamskipotatoe @dev2y @kopdragon I didn't land on my face though... haha.   Deserved win tonight and a record time for a Jamo strop at 30 seconds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattCarrel @jamskipotatoe @dev2y @kopdragon It wasn't that good!! 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattCarrel @jamskipotatoe @dev2y Well it was certainly better than when I fell over!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattCarrel @jamskipotatoe @dev2y Was that for the one you put in?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darrenshorty5 You were better than I remember.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonny_marchant Ajax didn't have Tom Brady.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>How are you supposed to deport someone who was born and raised in the U.K.?!  https://t.co/ob88hyVBmr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theDaveThomas82 @AW15_ @SkyNews She needs lessons from Andrew Neill. Absolute masterclass on Theresa May yesterday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timoconnorbl @brianmoore666 Course she does. This is about playing to people's perceptions/worries to get votes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @thepaulwilliams True. But JD was the form 13 during that tour.  What's bugging me is we have another world class 8 that will step up for Billy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @thepaulwilliams Maybe. Not sure Gats will go with an all Welsh back row though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @thepaulwilliams Moriarty?! Is there anyone else?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 @jamskipotatoe It was a question, not a statement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @ScottWoodfield1 Was he the worst player you were talking about?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y @jamskipotatoe Give him a chance Devs. It's only the 2nd time he's managed 14. Once he's mastered that he can look to pick good sides.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @LibDems @UKLabour @Conservatives We get it to both for lib dems<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Leejones2510lj @therealfootsie I'd leave the jokes to Foots... he's funny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alanepetersen No wine as yet. Food unreal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bit different from the view in Splott. #taormina #sicily  https://t.co/ovavGCniek<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So #eurovision is on in Italy. #result<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3 hours til we leave for a weeks holiday. Better start packing. Seriously.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @Trevla @therealfootsie @dev2y The one on the left is a spit of Trev.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JosephToplis...  https://t.co/306edHvWIO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@France24_en @gethin_aj Shame we don't have such a centrist party in the Uk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the plus side, at least #WxmAFC won't have to play there next season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gutted @NewportCounty stayed up. Horrible club. Horrible fans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realMChalmers @peanutismint Wow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BartonBank @UKLabour Is she ok? She sounds ill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bakke171 A couple. Any ideas?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bakke171 footy this week?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattCarrel @AW15_ Won't happen boys. However, your home shirt for next season is mint.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NathSalt1 @fearlessidzine @BuildTheBudget Not if Keates thinks that money is better spent elsewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattyWebber88 Wages apparently. I imagine he's on quite a bit...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bakke171 thought you'd appreciate this...  https://t.co/zKBHeztgwV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamRConnah the way some are carrying on you'd think we'd just missed out on promotion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_steviejd_ Never used them sorry pal. Been on their website but never booked through them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YorkCityFC @fearlessidzine It's like Gary Mills bingo...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamElliott_NLP This isn't a joke?! He almost relegated two clubs in one season. Glad #WxmAFC are shot of him. Hope #ycfc get rid of him too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fearlessidzine He #ycfc fans were clapping him off the pitch. #clueless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good old Gary Mills. Glad #WxmAFC got shot of him. #YCFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlunEbenezer @AlunEbenezer I'd have had money on Rice Krispies. @ealinglevy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realMChalmers @sam_a_liu @WestWingWeekly Awesome. Where's @NellyMoloney when you need her?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y Nope. Big Liverpool fan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y Big Liverpool fan though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis But you didn't...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis Liverpool have won it since then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alanepetersen Agree. That is equally as stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An energy price cap - great populist policy but complete nonsense. Are we expecting a cap on food prices next? #GE2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattCarrel genius. Not the brightest are they?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@liamwoodyatt probably right...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe Work a full week and I might, emphasis on might, give you a creme egg.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @ScSSofas Ceri likes it boiled so don't worry too much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Went to @Costco to buy some sensible things. Ended up with 48 creme eggs for £6. If anyone needs a creme egg...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sam_a_liu @ben_keen86 @__davidlewis @bcarswell @realMChalmers if I was Gats I'd have called him up just for fun.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bcarswell @ben_keen86 @sam_a_liu @realMChalmers @lionsofficial I think they'll lose one midweek. ABs will win series but each game be close<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 @__davidlewis @sam_a_liu @bcarswell @realMChalmers we can argue about the call ups too. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bcarswell @ben_keen86 @sam_a_liu @realMChalmers @lionsofficial enjoy it Ben. I think it will be closer than people think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 @sam_a_liu @bcarswell @realMChalmers it's also hard being a 7 if your pack is getting mullered a la the ospreys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 @sam_a_liu @bcarswell @realMChalmers yeh. I can see that. It's a big difference between him and Warburton who does turn up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sam_a_liu @bcarswell @ben_keen86 @realMChalmers im with you Samuel. Not sure Gatland will be though. Nearly always goes conservatively<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bcarswell @ben_keen86 @realMChalmers @sam_a_liu JD has had a dreadful season. If squad picked on form he shouldn't be in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 @bcarswell @realMChalmers @sam_a_liu problem Robshaw has is he's a worse version of Warburton. Tipuric is a different gravy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bcarswell @ben_keen86 @realMChalmers @sam_a_liu he's a liability. If you want to moan about someone's inclusion, try Jonathan Davies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bcarswell @ben_keen86 @realMChalmers @sam_a_liu and robshaw is not a patch on any of those back row players.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dylanfbrady @realMChalmers nothing is that bad...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alandavey yes - everyone who was in Bordeaux said it was lovely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mentalben @hamish_allen @brianmoore666 I'd have left Biggar at home (and Jonathan Davies). I hope SW is at 6. Great 6N there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sam_a_liu @realMChalmers It's a big squad. All signs point to Warrenball and not much else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mentalben @hamish_allen @brianmoore666 I can understand that. And Hamish Watson. He'd have pushed tipuric as I think they'll go SW at 6.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hamish_allen @brianmoore666 which Scottish players would you have included and at whose expense?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sam_a_liu @realMChalmers it's too easy today. On a serious note, two Scots is light. Biggar and JD very fortunate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realMChalmers @sam_a_liu I'm very relaxed. Just 🎣🎣.  I wouldn't have picked Biggar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sam_a_liu games will be close. Much closer than people think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sam_a_liu @realMChalmers put your other eye back in. Ford has a gripe not to be in not Russell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sam_a_liu back row will be SW - billy - Tips.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realMChalmers @sam_a_liu if I was going to continue my trolling I'd suggest that's not hard.   I'd have taken Watson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sam_a_liu what's your point? Typical Gatland selection.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Twitter meltdown. #LionsNZ2017 #Lions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sam_a_liu they were overrated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sam_a_liu he's playing inside centre instead of Roberts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sam_a_liu Did Cuthbert make it?! 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alandavey I liked Lyon when we were there in the summer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realMChalmers told you @sam_a_liu...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 @daihankey @sam_a_liu @__davidlewis he's not the best English hooker let alone the best British one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daihankey @sam_a_liu @__davidlewis haha. Thanks Dai.  Sam - you know it. Another one to watch - Gethin Jenkins. Reckon he could sneak in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis agreed. They'll also have a simple game plan - Gatlandball.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis he's played well for the Blues for a couple of months.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope he picks Cuthbert, just to watch the meltdown on here. #LionsNZ2017 #Lions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis totally agree. Be interesting come 11am with some of the other omissions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the least surprising of the English players staying at home. #Lions #LionsNZ2017  https://t.co/n3EVLAiZTe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 @owencottom @sam_a_liu @bcarswell I wouldn't have either of those two in the squad. Looks like both are though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@owencottom @sam_a_liu @ben_keen86 @bcarswell I'd love it if Cuthbert went. Just to watch the Twitter meltdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gareth1864 @SkySportsNewsHQ baffled with Roberts. Lock is a hard one. Too many world class players and not enough spaces.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smileyrhi "a friend"?! You can say it's yours...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bcarswell @ben_keen86 @sam_a_liu haha. He got it right against the Aussies.   Roberts can't even get in the Welsh team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 @bcarswell @sam_a_liu Gatland has lost it.  https://t.co/GyG0i6JAUb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bcarswell @ben_keen86 yeah. I can understand that but we don't have a load of good 10s. Other than Sexton it's very average (if Farrell 12)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 @bcarswell apparently Ford is missing out too. That's the biggest surprise if true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit @MattyWebber88 what's your point?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 @bcarswell when it goes wrong it's ugly though. Wal v Ire being a great example. SW does a job on Stander and it falls apart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 @bcarswell did you really just compare Heaslip to Keiran Reid? 😂 I'll be amazed if he tours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 @bcarswell I reckon it's true. Lock is a tough one - too many world class players. I'd take Joseph before JD though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 @bcarswell heaslip spends most of the game on the wing rather than doing what a number 8 should be doing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sam_a_liu Warburton to captain. Mostly English &amp; Irish, a few Welsh and Hogg.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bcarswell @ben_keen86 Heaslip is a show pony. Billy &amp; Faletau streets ahead of him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sam_a_liu @bcarswell lock is a bad example to make that point. Some quality won't go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @ScottWoodfield1 900 away fans when we've lost 7 in a row and have nothing to play for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeccaCath94 @markbutler1978 I really don't get it. How has he hoodwinked them all?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @ScottWoodfield1 not a bad away following 3 hours away from Wrexham considering we're crap.  https://t.co/8F6FdNTwTh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis @ben_keen86 that's a long heading. Have a safe journey over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jasonwxm1873 @fatmanfowls absolutely. He's just used the opportunity to see the whole squad. I'd be amazed if more than 3 stay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jasonwxm1873 @fatmanfowls no idea but Keates has had his eyes on next season since we got to 50 points.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fatmanfowls @Jasonwxm1873 bigger issue is the players just aren't good enough. Big summer coming up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbutler1978 @gareth1864 Yep. I think that would be better. It's good though. 2 games for a tenner. Can't go wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gareth1864 @markbutler1978 it's a great idea but at the wrong time of year. Only two games left after it so lose any momentum it builds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jasonwxm1873 @Wrexham_AFC won't be many on it, surely?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanG1878 @jamskipotatoe @JohnnyTheNic I'm amazed he has time to tweet today all things considered.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gareth1864 @paulmwrexham agreed but that article is talking FGR and Tranmere. Nothing has changed in respect to our budget being lower.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 @jamskipotatoe Liverpool won. He's ok.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Breninal1978 sounds like a plan. I've got cousins in Calgary. We loved it there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Breninal1978 when you planning on going?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe awesome.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@murph_stephen @jamskipotatoe @matt_paz17 my ankle is huge. Never saving one of vinnys shots again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y alright pal. Did you need to go to Cornwall in the end?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xbecca2110x @DairyMilkIn you used the Indian version?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 yes. I think we are too. I agree with what you are saying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 yes. That's a fair point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 referees spend too much time coaching and telling players what to do. They should just enforce the rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 I'd argue the ruck laws are as black and white as you can get. Certainly about what makes a ruck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 the ruck law is not vague. Not at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 he's not interpreted the rule. That's my point. He's enforced the rule. Too many refs interpret and you're left with a mess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @dallaglio8 you moan at Lacey for not reffing correctly and then moan at poite's legitimate response. He is there to enforce rules<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @dallaglio8 disagree. Poite refereed the ruck as per the rule book. His job is to enforce the rules not to coach etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JiffyRugby @BenJeffreys poor argument. Hasn't been in the game long so knows nothing. That's nonsense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sam_a_liu it's like watching Wales wearing white.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sam_a_liu it's refreshing to watch a game where the referee 1) understands the laws and 2) knows how to apply them. #ENGvITA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gilana25 what are you talking about? Not once have I claimed there was any bias.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 too many athletes and not enough rugby players.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 dreadful, wasn't it?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kejake1977 one of many errors from Lacey. He just doesn't understand the game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Professional rugby union is a game being destroyed by referees' inability to enforce the rules. #SCOvWAL #IREvFRA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now we have to put up with @AndyNic9 after a Scots win. Thankfully it doesn't happen often.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's been equally dreadful for both teams. #SCOvWAL  https://t.co/XDXZ1mONxG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If that had been Cuthbert we'd never hear the end of it.  #SCOvWAL  https://t.co/eG8FMstn1c<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't stand Hogg but that was a great pass. #SCOvWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lacey is making this up as he goes along. #ScoVWal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brianmoore666 it wasn't. Lacey bottled it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darrandowey @__davidlewis the costly one was the halfpenny miss before half time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brianmoore666  that's the least of Lacey's worries. He's a ref that doesn't understand the fundamentals of the game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wales just took advantage of an overlap for the first time since 1979. #SCOvWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlunEbenezer nice outfit mate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 what could possibly go wrong?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 you know it! He's dreadful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>John Lacey reffing. This could go either way.  #SCOvWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 how do you watch this every week?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 how is what Edinburgh did at that ruck any different to what he's penalised the Blues for? Any ideas @thepaulwilliams?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 he has no understanding of the game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thepaulwilliams that last penalty for Edinburgh was baffling Paul. This is why people don't watch the @PRO12rugby.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 do referees in the @PRO12rugby understand the rules?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thepaulwilliams I've been watching for 5 mins and already I can see the ref is having a terrible game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cardiffcouncil the whole of it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GNev2 if you can't see the difference between the two Gary there is no hope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichardBurgon when was the last time Labour didn't hold that seat?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes. I'm glad I support a fan owned club where decisions are made for the long term good not short term opportunism. #WxmAFC  https://t.co/Hk2vmTxPZx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @CardiffRugbyWeb how is he allowed to referee any professional game? Let alone an international.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 just go to Tesco like last time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Having fun cooking with these two. After spag Bol, fajitas and American pancakes we're onto a roast. @caz_mar no more cooking for you!!  😉  https://t.co/7mJOh8KamM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y @therealfootsie don't go pint for pint with him. Fool's game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @ScottWoodfield1 100 goals conceded cos they ain't scoring 100!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @ScottWoodfield1 conceded I presume you mean?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 congrats pal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamieBJenkins @Cardiffbus you been getting tips from @realDonaldTrump ok writing tweets? Sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@posh_esther @WestWingWeekly where are you up to?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of my favourite @Wrexham_AFC away days. We had some team back then. #WxmAFC  https://t.co/agTYQW3JSm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit @Wrexham_AFC can you listen to Calon FM online too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @ScottWoodfield1 least he'd support them if they went down. You'd just support Liverpool again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @ScottWoodfield1 like I care. Pitiful away support.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @ScottWoodfield1 I'd say nothing. I've seen Wrexham take away more than your 2nd team tonight. Big club - as if!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 @jamskipotatoe have you won in 2017 yet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe you used to be a big club...  https://t.co/Xpn8fLRRud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I know it's #ValentinesDay but just had this gruff bloke on the line who starts convo with "hello love". A bit forward.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wxmscully @neilcooke452 @stuharris85 @fearlessidzine Mills sorted all wages and contracts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit Keates doesn't seem bothered by those. Issue is the 30 starts, hence why he's on the bench.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit your 2nd sentence is obvious. Plays well, wants more cash. Sensible. That's not the initial issue here. That's the 30 games.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit it makes far more sense than your theory. Keates didn't play him due to contract offer it would trigger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit @fezbob if it's like the others then it's just a straight 30 game clause. Keates wanted renegotiation not Rooney.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbutler1978 @fearlessidzine agreed. Shame most of our fanbase can't see that both are ok.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbutler1978 @fearlessidzine We're not cheating Rooney. However, I understand why he might go elsewhere for more money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie you're not refereeing the game so that's ok.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have these officials got money on a Scotland win? #FRAvSCO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NFLGamePass when will sound FX for #SB51 be added to gamepass?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 @__davidlewis repeatedly. I think while he wasn't great he let the players play for the most part. That's a good thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 @__davidlewis he missed Cole at every scrum and he should have yellowed Haskell. He let both sides come in from the side (1/2)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 @__davidlewis he was penalising us for pulling it down when it was Cole not driving straight. We should have left them alone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 @__davidlewis we played to him very badly including his dreadful scrum refereeing. Why choose to scrum in that situation?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NFLGameDay when will the Sound FX for #SB51 be added to gamepass?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 what's your point?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gareth98954722 agreed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @Bigt8409 when did you turn into a rugby troll as well as an NFL one?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Eddie Jones knows they got out of jail. Wales have no one to blame but themselves. #WALvENG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @Bigt8409 that's in JD not Cuthbert.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Terrible kick from Davies. #WALvENG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stebrett they've been doing it all game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stebrett which is why he should be penalised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No @JiffyRugby and @brianmoore666 Garces hasn't. Missed countless infringements and should have issued at least 1 yellow. #WALvENG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet another one. Dan Cole not straight. #WALvENG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on Garces. That should be another yellow. #WALvENG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Garces has finally worked out people are not allowed in at the side having allowed it for both sides all game. #WALvENG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darrandowey @__davidlewis indeed. They're rattled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darrandowey @__davidlewis deservedly in front so far. #WALvENG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darrandowey @__davidlewis we've got to play the ref. No scrums unless necessary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis @darrandowey he was tackled without the ball too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darrandowey @__davidlewis Garces isn't having his best game. We stupidly don't play to that and carry on regardless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Correct. All three scrums have collapsed because he hasn't been straight. #WALvENG  https://t.co/ha6ExKy9pW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis agreed. Especially when Garces had already incorrectly penalised us at a scrum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is that a penalty to England. That went down because Dan Cole wasn't straight. #WALvENG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @Trevla agree on that. No-one near him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @Trevla you're so anti Wales it's funny. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's has to be a yellow Garces. #WALvENG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla technically it was accidental offside as Youngs drove into his own man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can't say they don't deserve to be in front but if Garces can't referee the ruck correctly it's going to be a long evening! #WALvENG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Energy companies can't win. All put prices up they are accused of a cartel. All do different things with prices also not fair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamessercombe @gruffter @__davidlewis @abercecminister @realMChalmers @punditsfolly he was a defensive tackle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamessercombe @gruffter @__davidlewis @abercecminister @realMChalmers @punditsfolly tight end? More like defensive tackle. 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe you loved every second.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#beautiful  https://t.co/Vhiw15ZX6T<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Offsidemccaw @LloydLegalist haha. They're mine though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fearlessidzine one of my favourite bits of sports commentary too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeanGlennon totally. They were the only things keeping Atlanta in it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Andy_Wrex yep. Very!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Andy_Wrex the patriots were basically losing 4-0 with 30 mins to go and won 5-4.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanG1878 so much for Brady being Cam Newton...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @Bigt8409 @therealfootsie did I dream that?! #SB51<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GHawke123 @joshowen555 @rob_hawke @NFL_Memes that was bonkers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 @jonny_marchant unbelievable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. #SB51<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Breninal1978 tom Brady has remembered he's tom brady.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on Tom. Now or never. #SB51<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No matter what game is on, it's always about @OsiUmenyiora. #SB51<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 we've been dreadful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Game over. #SB51<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well this escalated quickly. #SB51<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@punditsfolly I've got 10 others watching here. Sort of a tradition now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@punditsfolly too many. Pulled pork, ribs, sliders, nachos etc,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@punditsfolly I'm never confident for any team I support.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@punditsfolly everyone seems to think It will be close.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@punditsfolly osi talks complete nonsense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not sure who's worse @neilreynoldsnfl or @OsiUmenyiora. #SB51<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 already swapped to BBC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DFletcherSport  https://t.co/lH9pVakrWy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @IanG1878 except they win things...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @Trevla @therealfootsie @Owain_Jones @dev2y pulled port, sliders, nachos, ribs, wedges and more...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 dream on...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LifeofRiley6 who's your money on?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3 hours until #SB51. Come on Tom. Time for number 5. #NFL #Patriots  https://t.co/jT7F5RKYLv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone who's watched the Ospreys regularly will know Davies has been better than Biggar this season.  https://t.co/9SJ9cBzhQX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 he's been dreadful all game. Including allowing them to be offside for the majority of the first half.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Starter of #ITAvWAL before the main course of #SB51 this evening. Come on @WelshRugbyUnion &amp; the @Patriots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe Swansea your third team?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@prince_of_ales @EmmaTouhey @LeaderRich went to get his boots for a kid who got hit in the face.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @ScottWoodfield1 having a bad day Jamo?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 @jamskipotatoe never miss an opportunity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 you were saying?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattCarrel he's the worst player ever...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattCarrel niasse has just scored against you. Wow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 @sam_a_liu @lionsofficial Garin Jenkins?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 I phoned and told them they were in your accumulator<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis I was in school in 1996.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit what's your point?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis I have no interest in seeing it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe it's like me down @GolCardiff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit @Mattwedds @fezbob @fearlessidzine maybe he hasn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit @fairspearian I think they and Rooney are but on less money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I could never present @DIYSOS. I'd be blubbing in every episode. How does @MrNickKnowles do it?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlbertBreer he's releasing plenty of #fakenews though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y try supporting Wrexham.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 I've watched Wrexham win at Brentford.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 you ok out there?!  https://t.co/hq0wEifu9I<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@streboria @DizmalJimmy and me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @CezDavis @IanG1878 @ScottWoodfield1 who are you supporting?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Taking someone from work to UHW. Car park ticket machine at @CV_UHB is broken. Could be here a while.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BartonBank @BBCSport @EmiratesFACup BBC tried to show Lincoln v Brighton. FA refused.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gappy76 Here's your answer about Mane...  https://t.co/CRPBiqwwTq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RaheemKassam @jeffo365 the equivalent would be banning all Americans because of Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbutler1978 what's wrong with NFL?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ginge_1 @Mo_Farah correct. Not to mention thousands of refugees who are fleeing violence etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ginge_1 you have to be from those countries. But if you're from those countries you're out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know it's bad when I'm agreeing with @jeremycorbyn, though I'd have gone with the refugees Trump is refusing to take.  https://t.co/weLgfM453C<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 @ConcussionMovie @NFL good so far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching @ConcussionMovie. Shame on the  @NFL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@posh_esther fancy doing a blog in it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welcome to the world of @realDonaldTrump. Bonkers.  https://t.co/BT1rG1M9bX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpassmore93 they're not that good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @ScottWoodfield1 @jamskipotatoe you were supporting Cardiff that day though...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @ScottWoodfield1 @jamskipotatoe when was the last time you went to Anfield?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @ScottWoodfield1 @jamskipotatoe at least Jamo started supporting his when they were good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @ScottWoodfield1 @jamskipotatoe typical Liverpool response. Who cares about the premiership?! Support your local team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @jamskipotatoe you're crap. Just face up to it as opposed to thinking it's going to be "your year" every season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @jamskipotatoe 🎣   It's too easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @AW15_ that's not difficult.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis thought you supported Cardiff like @jamskipotatoe?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wrexhamafc @GS_WAFC @WSTtweets no worries. Thanks for such a prompt response.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wrexhamafc @GS_WAFC @WSTtweets I was asking about the shorts John. 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DizmalJimmy @WrexhamDSA can we get it online Jimmy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GS_WAFC @WSTtweets is it available online?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikehughescq @fortitude ok. May check it out again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikehughescq @fortitude just didn't get on with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikehughescq @fortitude gave up by the end of season 1.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smileyrhi that's good!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gethin_aj we had too many when we were there!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamessercombe amen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dylanfbrady me and @realMChalmers?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamieBJenkins @Cardiffbus is that your own private stop? "Quarry Dale".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drmarchant1 @ben_keen86 @jonny_marchant I'd rather we lost to the falcons than the Steelers or Packers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 @jonny_marchant @drmarchant1 Jonny and I are watching it at mine. Not sure on Dai.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonny_marchant @drmarchant1 @ben_keen86 should be a great game. Shame we have to wait two weeks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonny_marchant @drmarchant1 @ben_keen86 rule number one Jonny. Trash talk after the game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 @drmarchant1 a fairly accurate call for once.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gethin_aj it's beautiful up there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 nearly as much fun as Peyton but not quite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Offsidemccaw haha. Imagine!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Offsidemccaw least you didn't watch it all. Either AFC team will struggle to get close to the falcons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drmarchant1 sorry... it's all too much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Offsidemccaw wasn't expecting this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is nearly as good as the @Broncos getting whalloped by the @Seahawks in SB48. Nearly... #ATLvsGB #AtlantaFalcons #NFCChampionship<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>. @juliojones_11 is unreal. #ATLvsGB #NFLChampionship<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 @drmarchant1 I think if they keep Bell quiet the pats win by 10. This is just the sort of game they win and win well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drmarchant1 and Miami away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drmarchant1 agreed. Roethlisberger is as likely to lose it for them as win it. Also, Brady has excellent record vs Pittsburgh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drmarchant1 and we could cause them problems too. Will be close. BB will try and take Bell out of it and let it rest in roethlisberger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drmarchant1 if the Pats don't win it I hope they do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drmarchant1 given up on the broncos?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cerys_Ruth but true!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cerys_Ruth they'll need to be quick, very quick. 🙂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonny_Ol @therealfootsie @CaerphillySFA good luck mate!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cerys_Ruth the other one is still here! Haha.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cerys_Ruth Haha. There were two in there. Already eaten one. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sunday afternoon. Time for sweets.  https://t.co/Y8Xfk4Wwp3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gethin_aj enjoy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gethin_aj are you doing a tour of international airports? 😉 enjoy your holiday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ollie_shenton97 Welcome to @Wrexham_AFC!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's some guff being spoken at this #inauguration for #PresidentTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit @Wrexham_AFC @ChesterFC isn't that Proctor?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie @Trevla this would be cool!!  https://t.co/IaaXvGykqU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @MattCarrel @dev2y @bakke171 or been playing 7 a side with reggie. 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @bakke171 I didn't want to bet you a fiver. If I'd wanted to we'd have bet a fiver.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y @bakke171 @jamskipotatoe @MattCarrel reggie - you are the dirtiest player down there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neilreynoldsnfl was a good night. Thanks to you and @Jeff_Reinebold and the others. Come again!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla it was awesome. Really enjoyed it. @therealfootsie would have gone with you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drmarchant1 especially with Neil Reynolds on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla yes mate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>. @kevincadle total legend in Cardiff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@r77ulr @CarlHogan @fezbob that's terrible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jeff_Reinebold @NFLUK @SkySportsNFL looking forward to Cardiff on Wednesday Jeff!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Offsidemccaw they'll beat Atlanta too I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NFLUK it was underthrown...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on @dallascowboys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @ScottWoodfield1 and they can't even beat @OfficialWolves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe you strop less than him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tada1973 @RichWXM @WrexhamFCInfo @GS_WAFC can we have white socks next season?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonny_marchant @AtlantaFalcons hope you stuff them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmwrexham I hope Bryn's resignation triggers a greater discussion on how we stay fan owned but how we should structure ourselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmwrexham I'm not aware they had investment too. I'm not advocating investment but we must always question &amp; challenge how we do things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmwrexham are at the moment, where the only goal seems to be to get promotion.(I'd also like to see the chip removed from our shoulders)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmwrexham running a football club, is not just about appointing a manager though. I'd like to see our goals being far bigger than they..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmwrexham Clearly the manager is a huge part of what we do. We both know things are much better on this front since Keates' appointment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmwrexham Paul. Dont be silly. You made a statement, I asked you to back it up. We both know you can't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmwrexham @TomiCaws @robphillipshere enlighten you on what?! You said they'd only changed the manager. I asked how you knew that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmwrexham @TomiCaws @robphillipshere how on earth do you know they've done nothing different but change a manager?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomiCaws @robphillipshere @paulmwrexham not just about investors is it?! It's about how we structure ourselves to make things a success.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great service from Paul from @virginmedia who installed our new V6 box.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fearlessidzine @GS_WAFC I like the white. Like our away shirts back in the day!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbutler1978 @simonwxm we never get sensible debate because people go to the extremes.  As for aims, I'm not sure what they are TBH.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @Bigt8409 too obvious a troll that one. Must do harder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @Bigt8409 you were the one who said you'd bet. Go down the bookies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @Bigt8409 you're bonkers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @Bigt8409 you won't win your division next year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCWalesSport @Alan_Alger_ @BBCWalesNews interesting take on what he said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@welshlinzi you went to Birmingham to watch Tv?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gareth1864 @paulmwrexham @AuctioneerAndy @BrynLaw @WSTtweets no dissenting voices allowed in some fan's mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarethPW very impressed so far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarethPW what's he done now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fearlessidzine 1994?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoddfaJohn it was a close run thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mental snow in #cardiff tonight.  https://t.co/UuHJowODOI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cerys_Ruth great book<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y yes. Freezing. Will be good to be back though. I've missed it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y you'll beat United. You always turn up against them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit just something else to beat the @TheOriginalWST over the head with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 @jamskipotatoe two big myths: 1) Liverpool have best fans. 2) Anfield has an amazing atmosphere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gareth1864 the Yellowstone ones on @BBCTwo this week were good too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AW15_ my point is it's nonsense now yet the media propagate it likes its fact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AW15_ but all true. Famous Anfield atmosphere is nearly as big a myth as Liverpool have the best fans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Banjalero exhausted. Over 250 people were there. Was overwhelming to see so many there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Banjalero it was as good as it could have been.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WildFire_79 sometime it's the little things that take our breath away.  Was a lovely day thank you. nearly 300 people came.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaskillS @therealfootsie everyone thought he was hilarious. Just under 300 came along. Lovely send off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamieBJenkins @therealfootsie it was lovely to have you both there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WildFire_79 I've had one of those too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie don't know what you mean pal!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie thanks to you and @JamieBJenkins for coming. Really appreciated it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sad day today in many ways as we remember Dad's life but I'm very thankful for the 37 years I had with him.  https://t.co/OU1kg754mX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmwrexham @GarethPW that was one of the craziest rumours of all. Some people just make up nonsense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmwrexham @GarethPW I think Keates is more decisive than Morrell. Hopefully a couple more to come.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ohwhatagaz yes mate. Also signed one of the best left backs in the league too as well as getting rid of 6 players. A good couple of days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmwrexham @GarethPW yep. Think Keates has had a good week though. Hope it all comes together tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarethPW @paulmwrexham maybe left side of MF then? That would also make sense with Evans going.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmwrexham @GarethPW my guess is the Jennings signing means he won't be around long. Really pleased with Keates' business today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarethPW @paulmwrexham off to Brighton, isn't he?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCP_14_ @fairspearian why do you think that was not the case?   My staff in work ask for more time etc. My job is to say no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCP_14_ @fairspearian no one has said it did but it's a huge step from there to say he was actively killing the club.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmwrexham best one yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCP_14_ @fairspearian too many though will blame Saunders for everything because of what he said about fan ownership.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCP_14_ @fairspearian who has said that?! Most are rightly pointing out the blame is with Moss not Saunders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCP_14_ @m_w890 the fact there was no budget is not Saunders fault. Struggling how Mo$$ &amp; Robber don't get the blame for that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neilcooke452 @JCP_14_ he was a poodle? Possibly. You're making out it was all deliberate. I don't buy that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neilcooke452 @fairspearian @JCP_14_ @JonBowie1 @tredragon he was trying to make money not destroy a football club.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @Trevla same here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fearlessidzine very good day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fairspearian @JCP_14_ @neilcooke452 @JonBowie1 @tredragon that's what he is arguing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fairspearian @JCP_14_ @neilcooke452 @JonBowie1 @tredragon exactly. It's a nonsense arguement. This is on Moss.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neilcooke452 @JonBowie1 @tredragon @JCP_14_ I don't think Saunders was bright enough to get it all. I'd also say it's time to move on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neilcooke452 @JonBowie1 @tredragon @JCP_14_ no team is allowed up that operates in the red?! I doubt that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neilcooke452 @JonBowie1 @tredragon @JCP_14_ because it was Moss's job. If you're allowed to keep spending, you keep spending.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neilcooke452 @JonBowie1 @tredragon @JCP_14_ no FFP at that point. We'd have been ok. Your hatred clouds everything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neilcooke452 @JonBowie1 @tredragon @JCP_14_ you ask for more, you get more, you keep asking for more. Moss should have said no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCP_14_ Agreed. It's the major reason I wouldn't want him back. Needs a lot of cash to succeed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCP_14_ because no-one stopped him. He saw us as a stepping stone. Getting us promoted was good for his CV. Moss should have stepped in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCP_14_ yep. Would never want him back. Needs a lot of money to succeed but I think he wanted to get us up not to kill the club.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neilcooke452 @JonBowie1 @tredragon @JCP_14_ I actually think he was trying to get us promoted. (Not that I'd want him back).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neilcooke452 @JonBowie1 @tredragon @JCP_14_ that's on Moss sorry. He allowed him to do it. There were no controls. Why would DS make some?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCP_14_ best way is to prove him wrong.   As for ££ who wouldn't spend what they were allowed to. That's on Moss not Saunders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCP_14_ we've got to be big enough to accept that some people have different opinions and that's ok rather than taking it as an insult.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCP_14_ @JonBowie1 Saunders gets some unfair grief because of his attitude towards fan ownership. He worked his nads off when manager here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wxmscully @JCP_14_ had the fans not stepped in we'd have gone bust. We're are not in that situation any more. (2/2)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wxmscully @JCP_14_ we were losing 100s of thousands of pounds a year and had debts of 750k. (1/2)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCP_14_ people have very short memories. We have to make sure they never forget.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCP_14_ @Wxmscully club has not nailed that message at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't believe this was 25 years ago.  https://t.co/xiQ6tLHxMM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamessercombe @ealinglevy we lost the year I went up as I had tickets to the game. All good fun though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ealinglevy @jamessercombe was that when we went to Scotland?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @ScottWoodfield1 knew you'd be on here at some point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WSTtweets did I miss 3,4 and 5?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @Bigt8409 don't feed the troll. He'll get bored eventually and go and abuse @ArrivaTW instead.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just caught up on #sherlock. Wow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 @jamskipotatoe it's his 2nd team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit agreed that achieves nothing positive. Stopping it won't be achieved by having a go at them though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit your superiority complex is nauseating. Some of these folk have valid points.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit @BrynLaw can you tweet without having some sort of dig at a part of our fan base?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BartonBank @BrynLaw they're the exception. The more we compete financially the better our chances. Can be done w/out compromising ownership<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrynLaw bang on Bryn. If we're serious about getting back in the FL we have to compete financially.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fearlessidzine @78Spirit I agree they're the worst. Wondering how @78Spirit we're going to say differently...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit @fearlessidzine which Wrexham team was worse?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tada1973 @paulmwrexham first two updates have been spot on. Good to see us learning lessons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simonwxm contemplating whether I'll get away with it or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@r77ulr @Wrexham_AFC and mind. They are nowhere near his best 10 though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuziHarrisx about 5 months. Hang in there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuziHarrisx go to bed. Warmer there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SuziHarrisx lack of warmth. Otherwise known as winter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daihankey thanks Dai. Beautiful up here today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 thanks pal.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ealinglevy @AlunEbenezer @SwanseaGrand surprised you two weren't in it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarlHogan top man carl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarlHogan look forward to reading/seeing all about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@red_alan_ @wxm_matt @el_paperboy @Racecourse_C_F @Wrexham_AFC good stuff.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@red_alan_ @wxm_matt @el_paperboy @Racecourse_C_F @Wrexham_AFC I live in Cardiff so sadly can't make it often.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wxm_matt @el_paperboy @Racecourse_C_F they may well have done but @Wrexham_AFC have missed a trick here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neilcooke452 @JCP_14_ it shows the stupidity of football clubs that so many wanted Mills.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neilcooke452 @JCP_14_ could well have. I thought exactly what you did about those 2 though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neilcooke452 @JCP_14_ that's my reading of what's happened too. (Though there's plenty that said BH didn't want Mills).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neilcooke452 @JCP_14_ head in sand. He was a dinosaur entrenched in the 1970s. They made a mistake. They've learned from it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neilcooke452 @JCP_14_ thankfully they appear to have learned their lesson with their appointment of DK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neilcooke452 @JCP_14_ I'm happy to admit that was the case but I'd also say the board knew far more than the average fan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neilcooke452 @JCP_14_ I'd also add it's about learning from mistakes. If we don't admit we've made them, we'll never learn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neilcooke452 @JCP_14_ don't be daft, just a realist that the board made a mistake. I'm not asking for them to be hung drawn and quartered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neilcooke452 @JCP_14_ that's not what I said. You twist it to suit the board is always right agenda you have.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCP_14_ read the rest of my tweets. We didn't know all that. I certainly didn't. The board should have.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCP_14_ Mills was the wrong choice due to training methods, recruitment methods etc. The warning flags were there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@red_alan_ @markbutler1978 @JCP_14_ training methods, recruitment methods etc. Should have been one red flag after another.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@red_alan_ @markbutler1978 @JCP_14_ I wouldn't have appointed him if I'd known what the board knew.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbutler1978 @JCP_14_ I think squad assembly should be a joint responsibility with the deciding vote going to the manager.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCP_14_ do you have the capacity to admit the board get things wrong sometimes? If they were involved that's no better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCP_14_ they still need agreed goals and need to be accountable for their decisions. It's folly to leave one man in charge of it all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCP_14_ you've clearly never managed. I let people I manage manage their people but they don't just get left to get on with it. (1/2)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCP_14_ please just answer the question. It's not that difficult. I'll then answer yours. Should the board just have let him get on?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbutler1978 @JCP_14_ @fezbob absolutely. As fans we weren't aware of all that but the board were. If they weren't they should have been.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbutler1978 @JCP_14_ @fezbob at the stake but I'm also fed up of fans thinking they are above scrutiny and so no wrong. (2/2)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbutler1978 @JCP_14_ @fezbob they knew enough not to appoint Mills. They ignored that. I'm not asking for them to be burned (1/2)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCP_14_ @fezbob do you think they should have let Mills just get on with it? Really?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCP_14_ @fezbob the board was responsible for giving Mills carte Blanche to do what he wanted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit award of the most pointless tweets of the season.  https://t.co/E2ICYFFaMV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis sorry my suggestions were twenty years late.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis steps and S club 7 the other two?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @jamskipotatoe what is greigh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 he's becoming more grating by the week on @SkySportsNFL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattCarrel @IanG1878 he's a liability.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neilcooke452 @78Spirit disagree. They should have just accepted the £4K. It gave those who want to moan a needless opportunity to do so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit it's a PR own goal though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCP_14_ @rjonesyo the key to us staying up is the January transfer window.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neilcooke452 @78Spirit yep. Just sign up.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dev2y footy this week sir?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @ScottWoodfield1 league leaders sunshine. We're going up... ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis the worst opposition we've faced in the AIs for years. Still of the opinion Howley and Gatland need to go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis hammered by Aussies, struggled against Argies who Eng beat with 14, squeaked in v Japan and the worst SA in memory.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis we're dreadful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tipuric just took a better line and showed better feet than any Welsh back. #WALvSA<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@abercecminister @ealinglevy @aberconference are you saying Aber is a trendsetter and the rest of the world is just catching up?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RAStap01 @SDoughtyMP you could argue the current one does exactly that for Labour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SDoughtyMP @RAStap01 if Labour benefitted would you be for this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RAStap01 @SDoughtyMP I get why Stephen doesn't like it but it's hardly undemocratic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RAStap01 @SDoughtyMP it could be but it also means every vote is worth the same. That's a good thing?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RAStap01 @SDoughtyMP agree that's an issue but not an undemocratic one as was claimed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RAStap01 @SDoughtyMP that's the issue. As a point of principle, surely making all constituencies the same rough size is a good thing?!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NoddfaJohn yep. Either that or an independent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoddfaJohn not sure I could vote for either if I was American.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's like the 1930s all over again. #BREXIT  https://t.co/vYJG2MHrPE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanG1878 @thatphillad yeh but that new stand is amazing. 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 Joubert did his usual non-job of refereeing the breakdown but we're rubbish because of our game plan. Not him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drmarchant1 @WelshRugbyUnion unlike @FAWales who's pricing policy is awesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MR51CUK @WelshRugbyUnion I'd argue the £60 ticket prices have more to do with it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BartonBank we look like we've never played rugby before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have the @WelshRugbyUnion half filled the ground with mannequins and not people? #WALvAUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brianmoore666 you're 3 weeks early...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alanepetersen the road is closed apparently. There's an accident.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis @ealinglevy @thepaulwilliams @sport_swep you've got to wonder why the paper article isn't about you and Levy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mental programme on @realDonaldTrump on @BBCTwo. How is this man running for President?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thatphillad @jamskipotatoe @dev2y @bakke171 @Trevla you boys deserve it Phillip.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @dev2y @bakke171 @Trevla sorry for not putting my shooting boots on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @Bigt8409 @therealfootsie @ChrisWesseling @Dameshek Brees<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fearlessidzine happy to help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y footy mate?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigbluejedi it's on tonight I think. Also a show on Fri/Sat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigbluejedi @SkySportsNFL highlights are on #bbcnfl. It's good coverage too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomLikeFootball @UK_Patriots agreed. Bill wins more of these than he loses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla the most Belichick trade ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UK_Patriots at the very least it sends a huge message to the rest of the defence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WillBrabrook regardless of how good Collins is, these trades work out more often than not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love all the @Patriots fans going crazy about the Collins trade. It's trades like this that have kept them successful for so long. #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 he's better than ever. The hogan throw was mental.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stebrett @Interstellar loved it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time to find out if @Interstellar is worth all the fuss. #movienight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's right Rio. Tom Heaton came through @Wrexham_AFC's youth system. #WxmAFC  https://t.co/VEmLMzCrPy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattCarrel @Trevla @jamskipotatoe @dev2y @matt_paz17 @bakke171 @thatphillad what's wrong with passing backwards or something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lewisroderick there's nothing worse than a gloating Turk. Even gloating Jacks aren't as bad.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Trevla @Bigt8409 @PRO12rugby watch...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @Bigt8409 this is why I don't want @PRO12rugby. Officiating is dreadful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @Bigt8409 the officiating is terrible in the whole league.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @Bigt8409 he's dreadful. It's not about being pro/anti blues it's about making the right decisions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neilcooke452 @78Spirit does it have to be anyone's fault?! The board and manager thought he should leave. End of.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit @rhystaylor30 leave it out and get the chip off your shoulder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrexhamFCInfo @fatmanfowls @Benjaminbooga @Newts_23 @Wrexham_AFC @fearlessidzine because the board &amp; manager felt it best to do so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrexhamFCInfo @fatmanfowls @Benjaminbooga @Newts_23 @Wrexham_AFC @fearlessidzine do you want a full breakdown of every transfer?! Really?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrexhamFCInfo @fatmanfowls @Benjaminbooga @Newts_23 @Wrexham_AFC @fearlessidzine the club ain't the one making up rumours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fearlessidzine @neilcooke452 @RichWXM that's on Mills not Keates. If we need to sell to get more in then Newts was an obvious choice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fearlessidzine @neilcooke452 @RichWXM but we have good cover in his position not in the others. It was a no brainer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gowenmedia yep. Sure it's the 6th.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fearlessidzine @neilcooke452 @RichWXM the value for money is was giving us was dreadful. Never mind the rumours about his attitude.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gowenmedia isn't it next week?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chids64 @badsofa @Centenary_Club bad sofa is the parody account.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @jamskipotatoe @MattCarrel @dev2y @matt_paz17 @bakke171 @thatphillad if you find it, please return it to him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @dev2y @MattCarrel @matt_paz17 @bakke171 @thatphillad you'd rather listen to tariff calls than win?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @MattCarrel @dev2y @matt_paz17 @bakke171 @thatphillad doesn't mean it happened because of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @MattCarrel @dev2y @matt_paz17 @bakke171 @thatphillad just because something happens after something else...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @dev2y @matt_paz17 @MattCarrel @bakke171 @thatphillad he wasn't the one not tracking me, Matt C or Owen. #scapegoat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @dev2y @matt_paz17 @MattCarrel @bakke171 @thatphillad he was nowhere near the worst on your team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 why don't you just unfriend them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y mate I've had a mare. Only need one not two.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y all on colours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y how good are they?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie @Trevla @beewestwood the Hammers are always at it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y will let you know in the morning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y a couple.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@fearlessidzine Gerry, Gerry McDonagh. He shoots and he scores cos he hates goalless draws...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y footy mate?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelenPGP ouzo is rank.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie why?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie who'd retweeted it. I saw the pic and knew it was you!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie I knew it'd be you who retweeted that without even checking. 😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarethPW agreed. They say not though,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They obviously missed what he's done to @Wrexham_AFC over the past season and a half. #WxmAFC  https://t.co/6TaFkOimVF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Terrible start. #Patriots<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BartonBank @fezbob on the face of it they have. Must have seen my tweets. Haha.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BartonBank @fezbob they've clearly learnt their lesson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaskillS @WestonbirtArb yes. Was beautiful yesterday.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Get your tissues ready before you read this piece on #Aberfan. Heartbreaking.  https://t.co/JefgpOmuFs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cheminot1 @BBCWales terrible. Unlike @SkyNews where the correspondent there was struggling to hold it together.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lady on @SkyNews struggling to get through her piece on #Aberfan without bursting into tears.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @jamskipotatoe @dev2y @therealfootsie @MattCarrel my highlight was @matt_paz17 having a @Leejones2510lj goal to shots ratio.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @Trevla @dev2y @therealfootsie @matt_paz17 @MattCarrel get a grip. We had 6.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@simonwxm if red passion is to be believed it'll be trending by 8:15.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdrianC71 @Wrexham_AFC @paulmwrexham that is exactly the message that should be coming out of the club.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarethPW there are a number I'd like to see us offer a mutual termination of their contract.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCP_14_ @Benjaminbooga we know he wasn't with Mills.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tredragon @neilcooke452 this is why we're members. It's our responsibility.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neilcooke452 @streboria @r77ulr well now you've heard it from someone who is pro WST. We must get better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neilcooke452 @mattywi11s @streboria @r77ulr @Wrexham_AFC it's about learning from mistakes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neilcooke452 @mattywi11s @streboria @r77ulr @Wrexham_AFC don't be daft. Why do we have to be at either extreme?...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@streboria @neilcooke452 @r77ulr @Wrexham_AFC I think we could have. He was a terrible fit for a community football club.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neilcooke452 @streboria @r77ulr @Wrexham_AFC the fans knew very little compared to the board and tranmere's interest cooled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neilcooke452 @mattywi11s @streboria @r77ulr @Wrexham_AFC it's about accountability. You keep your head in the sand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattyWebber88 @mattywi11s @streboria @r77ulr relegated. Must now make funds available to new manager. (Even if out of money reserves).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattyWebber88 @mattywi11s @streboria @r77ulr learnt our lesson and set our own agenda next time. We're in serious danger of getting...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattyWebber88 @mattywi11s @streboria @r77ulr have been ringing. Not asking for resignations or anything like that. Just hope we've...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattyWebber88 @mattywi11s @streboria @r77ulr as I said. If I'd have known about his training techniques and plans the alarm bells would...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@streboria @mattywi11s @r77ulr agreed. We're going to need some more players though. These will take us down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@r77ulr @mattywi11s @streboria and I thank you for your hard work. 👍 We can and will get through this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattywi11s @streboria @r77ulr the fans didn't have access to the info the board did. I'd also add doing what fans want isn't their job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@streboria @mattywi11s @r77ulr Wilkin was the right type of appointment. Whoever is next must have a 2-3 year plan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@streboria @mattywi11s @r77ulr we didn't know the half of it. They did. Training methods &amp; plan should've had alarm bells ringing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattywi11s @streboria @r77ulr @Wrexham_AFC they do a great job on the whole but they aren't above reproach. They messed this one up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@streboria @r77ulr @Wrexham_AFC mills is responsible. They are accountable. They knew his plan and training methods before appointing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@streboria @r77ulr @Wrexham_AFC the board must take some responsibility for this mess. They appointed him and allowed things to get this bad<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@emmajdoll @Garybenno7 @JCP_14_ @paulmwrexham I think they do a great job for our team but got this one wrong. That's life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emmajdoll @Garybenno7 @JCP_14_ @paulmwrexham agreed but we weren't aware of his methods. The board were &amp; IMO shouldn't have appointed him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emmajdoll @Garybenno7 @JCP_14_ @paulmwrexham based on his methods etc it was a poor choice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fearlessidzine @78Spirit there's no point, they've had their head in the sand re. Mills all season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis read this:  https://t.co/trqR8O5zlM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarethPW @streboria @JCP_14_ that's an excellent legal analysis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@streboria @neilcooke452 @fearlessidzine @fezbob agree entirely. There should be a happy medium.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@streboria @neilcooke452 @fearlessidzine @fezbob agreed but the fact we have volunteers shouldn't be an excuse not to be better either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@streboria @neilcooke452 @fearlessidzine @fezbob some raise valid points but it gets drowned out in the feeding frenzy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It could be argued that we only got worse under his leadership.  https://t.co/gXuSGhde2i<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 @jamskipotatoe @Trevla @dev2y @matt_paz17 @MattCarrel foots scored...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @Trevla @dev2y @matt_paz17 @MattCarrel I think @therealfootsie will want him to stay. First goal since 2004.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit @fezbob we must take this opportunity to do just that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nickjwoolley too early in the season but we've had a great start without him. He's come back looking sharp though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickjwoolley @Patriots yes I am. 😀 he's ripping it up. Haha.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheWelshDragon9 @78Spirit some were booing in the Ninian Stand. It's bonkers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit @TheWelshDragon9 that's not excusing the booing. Mental,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit does Mills have something on you?! PS - the subs were poor. We were getting overrun in midfield so he takes a midfielder off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thepaulwilliams the rugby championship has shown that Wales weren't that bad down there. ABs on another level.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tada1973 keep up your hard work. Difficult decisions to be made. Don't envy you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 @jamskipotatoe you are correct. However the media is acting like you were playing the equivalent of Germany.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You'd think they'd beaten Brazil 2-0. #ENGMAL  https://t.co/pNNIbWNiZk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichWXM @fearlessidzine he's delusional. Need to get rid. Quickly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tonywhilding88 wilkin was also a better manager.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichWXM @paulmwrexham the situation we are in is entirely of Mills' making.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie @CwrtFc @Jonny_Ol @Stand_by_G @JordanGPrice those early finishes are doing the trick. 🏆🎖🏅⚽️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbutler1978 agreed. Action needs to be taken or we'll be Stockport. Change of manager and change of football plan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Breninal1978 enjoy!! And hope the Golf goes well!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbutler1978 wilkin was far better than Mills. He got given far less time too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fearlessidzine mills has to go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We didn't lose because we were lucky. We lost because we're a dreadful football team. #WxmAFC  https://t.co/d5WFobfT0M<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The best #WxmAFC forum by a country mile. Need to post there more often.  https://t.co/uoMytfmufv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCP_14_ @neilcooke452 isn't it a valid question? We are dreadful at the moment. The football is as turgid as anything served up by Wilkin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lovely afternoon swimming with the fish at Vai. #crete  https://t.co/KgQBz5ZypW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beauty. #crete  https://t.co/FSfx1WAqyw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darktaff Crete.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really?! This is very typical of Mills' other jobs.  https://t.co/zHgo2sX1KF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@streboria he shows no inclination to with his one year cycles. We need to build a squad not do one year hit and hopes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@streboria he's been an unmitigated disaster. Time for the club to start planning medium term and give someone the next two seasons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning.  https://t.co/dAmkR1Wnpl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 looks awesome. 😳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alandavey this little piggy is normally working hard. 😃got through prodigal God in an hour. Great little book.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guess I could be in worse places on a Tuesday afternoon. #crete  https://t.co/poBlv0srgR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla ouch. They were playing the jets though. 6 interceptions!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla who had that?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gethin_aj @ealinglevy he told me he wasn't writing one as it was "too dangerous".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gatwick_Airport thanks. First time there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Far too early to be awake. At @Gatwick_Airport for our flight to Crete.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MMehtaNYDN @PhilAPerry @CSNNE a broken clock gets it right twice a day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @jamskipotatoe exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @jamskipotatoe do you want Man Utd to do well when Liverpool aren't in the tournament?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @jamskipotatoe you support England and Wales...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @jamskipotatoe do you support man united as well as Liverpool?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmwrexham why do people still think that?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sounds like he really wants to stay. #WxmAFC  https://t.co/xwky6Bj2Ks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmwrexham what did he say?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 if you ever play Chester I promise I'll support you then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As bad as we've been I'm still gutted to be missing @Wrexham_AFC vs Chester. Off to @Gatwick_Airport instead. #holiday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCP_14_ that was a great night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wrexham_AFC @r77ulr ps - I wasn't intending to be a pain. Just want to see as many there as possible and hopefully 3 points.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wrexham_AFC @r77ulr the web page linked to is very informative. Just suggesting we could use have used "buy your tickets" etc in tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wrexham_AFC @r77ulr I'm well aware of how Twitter works. Just trying to be helpful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@r77ulr @Wrexham_AFC "ticket info" doesn't do this. Last tweet sent is much better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@r77ulr @Wrexham_AFC info in the tweet. Only link should be to ticket site. Make it easy for people and make them make a decision.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@r77ulr @Wrexham_AFC all of them have required people to go in a link. None with your simple message.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@r77ulr that's exactly what the club should be tweeting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last day in work until 4th October. #holiday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y whites<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#carfreecardiff is going well. Roads much busier than normal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikehughescq @Wrexham_AFC I'll have to try harder. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikehughescq @Wrexham_AFC I'm still here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @PaulHollywood she should have on in week one and two.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @Trevla @therealfootsie because I've never seen anyone get a good trade out of you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @Trevla @therealfootsie rule number 1 - never trade with esposti.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @Bigt8409 @therealfootsie I'll trade you Gurley for Peterson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WestWingWeekly 19,999 according to FB. I just joined.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarlHogan @MCO @Gemma7586 love that atrium.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 footy this week?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y good good. You are in. Missed a couple of great games.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Madonna Kebab. #MakeABandEdible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wham Bar #MakeABandEdible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Loving #MakeABandEdible. How about M &amp; M people?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So tomorrow is International talk like a Pirate day. Apart from #Bristol, where it's just Monday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCP_14_ @paulmwrexham it would be interesting to see what his budget was. It also shows how many players he needs to get it right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmwrexham @JCP_14_ we need to find one who is and build a squad with them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmwrexham @JCP_14_ his wholesale turnover in players makes me think he needs to go as he can't play the long game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmwrexham @JCP_14_ we're never going to get there playing one year hit and hope. He had the basis of a good team and ripped it apart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmwrexham @JCP_14_ how much time?! Would you give him a new deal for 2 years and say to him he's got 2 years to build that squad?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmwrexham @JCP_14_ I'm not asking to sack the manager but I think you'll find mills has had 56 league games. Ps - pls answer my Q.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alwyn59 @78Spirit exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmwrexham @JCP_14_ we're getting worse Paul. What's your solution?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmwrexham @JCP_14_ this one year hit and hope cycle we are in is ludicrous. Get the right man in and give him the time to fix it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmwrexham @JCP_14_ 90% of our history has been spent at a level above this one. Casual fans are as important as "loyal" ones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alwyn59 @78Spirit mills is on a one year cycle. That needs to change if we're to be successful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmwrexham @JCP_14_ it's not about being loyal Paul. People just drift when the product is garbage. We need to change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCP_14_ the board need to if we're ever to get out of this league. The fans will leave soon anyway if this nonsense carries on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCP_14_ @hdotjones if he had a plan I think he would. Most understood this was a two year job at least. Mills is in one year mode though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit agreed but let's put that plan in place. If mills is the guy, extend his contract and give him 2/3 years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree entirely. Mills philosophy seems to be different to that though at this moment. #WxmAFC  https://t.co/bjj0WmQglO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanG1878 he's dreadful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit we need to decide 1) if Mills is the guy and 2) what we want the football strategy to be. Rip it up and start again don't work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit I don't have any hopes of the playoffs thus far. We'll do well to finish top half if we carry on as we have.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit from what we've seen so far, what other hopes do you have?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh dear Lee Mason. #EVEMID<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@E16KW @78Spirit head in sand. It's pointless. We're getting worse each season and no plan to make it better. All hopes pinned on White.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit you didn't answer my question. We're getting worse. There seems to be no coherent plan on the pitch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit is that what you're happy with? Genuine question, not trolling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit aren't you worried in the slightest?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattyWebber88 too many with their heads in the sand. We're getting worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbutler1978 they're already at it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevin_traynor75 lovely castle there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis haha. That's probably better than a medal!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis she gets a muddle for pulling such a hunk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickjwoolley @jennalouise80 thank you sir. A happy day!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GreeningRachel I think I steal the show.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>11 years ago today I married this one. The time has flown!  https://t.co/trJh757KU5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie here you go...  https://t.co/GPyfJ45uhQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie @R_Hennessy we can say we were there the day a @matt_paz17 trick came off. 7 yrs of hurt but the boy delivered tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 if your penis is that shaped I'm worried.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesvobrien he's bonkers. Brilliant but bonkers. Imagine him and Gronk in the same dressing room.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @Bigt8409 @therealfootsie @dev2y @NFLUK watched it last night. Good programme.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daihankey we shall have to catch up soon for a coffee or something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @tmorello @springsteen there's worse faux pas than that one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie @UKLabour don't dispute the reasons for doing it may be flawed. The principle is bang on though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie @UKLabour it's hardly unfair though. Each boundary should be fairly equal, don't you think?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What's unfair about the proposed boundary changes other than @UKLabour get less seats?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@taylorftcalvin which one? There's tickets still left for the Georgia game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daihankey just off it on Harold Street. Close to you?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@posh_esther it's awesome. We really enjoyed it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbutler1978 the problem with @78Spirit and @JCP_14_ is too much focussing on the idiots and not enough focus on our manager.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit @markbutler1978 the irony.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbutler1978 crazy isn't it?! All hearing what they want to hear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottWoodfield1 I'm supporting you today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickjwoolley I watched the raiders saints game. Mental. Totally mental.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cerys_Ruth I'm glad. (That it was the shirt).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickjwoolley what game you watching?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Raiders!!!! #NFL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cerys_Ruth looks like a shirt to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benfides That's how I managed to catch a bit of it. Seemed to be just a bunch of posh people bouncing up and down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People actually like this?! #lastnightoftheproms<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WildFire_79 Happy Birthday!! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmwrexham @BBCRadioWales @robphillipshere its poor though, isn't it Paul?! Booing is not the answer however Mills isn't either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCRadioWales @robphillipshere @paulmwrexham we seem to be getting worse though, not better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit keeping heads in the sand and presuming that everything is ok at #WxmAFC helps?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit do you have room for any dissent?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CardiffUniCU @sam_a_liu he's a good looking chap after all.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Cerys_Ruth I can sense it. The capitals gave it away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y @LastChanceU @NetflixUK @AZCardinals called all or nothing. Much better than hard knocks. (As is @LastChanceU).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y @LastChanceU @NetflixUK there’s a good one on Amazon prime too about the @AZCardinals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y @LastChanceU @NetflixUK amazing series.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drmarchant1 apparently he might not be back for 2017 either. I'm less annoyed with BB for drafting QBs high up even with Brady though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drmarchant1 Vikings was a panic purchase but then theyre in superbowl or bust mode with AP only having a couple of seasons left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They’d be better off with no QB.  https://t.co/V17jySA54r<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@smileyrhi what’s your budget?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JordanGPrice don't forget to register on the NFL thing today!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ginge_1 there’s more than a passing resemblance.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Darktaff @ohwhatagaz more like compo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ealinglevy @jamessercombe I’d organise a whip round for you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ealinglevy will you start your own version soon?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattCarrel @dev2y nice. With devs?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y @jamskipotatoe in fairness, last week was the first time he’s dropped the c bomb in a while.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y off anywhere nice? You’ll keep your place!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y footy this week?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @Trevla I love it. Watch loads.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis  it was awesome. Great movie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching #themartian.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@78Spirit yes we should. What happens off the field (ie strategy etc) doesn’t seem to happen for on field activity. #WxmAFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Drewe Broughton would walk into this #WxmAFC team.  https://t.co/Uv9UEfck3X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are rubbish. #WxmAFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realMChalmers yep. Some clubs could really benefit from that exposure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realMChalmers yep. But the BBC continue to promote then even though they don’t need it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Salford City is hardly proper football. They’re a (four) millionaires play thing.  https://t.co/bRrwlJKKKP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y colours mate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samueloakford government own the trains and controls price increase… #nationalisation a red herring.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@laurens_s it’s overblown nonsense but JC only has himself to blame - he promised and end to spin and a start to authenticity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deedoorknobs and nationalisation won’t fix that. Government owns the trains and sets the price increases. #traingate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#traingate is bonkers. Shame Corbyn has allowed this to be on the agenda rather than talking about the Tories and the human rights act.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @Bigt8409 or maybe it’s because Sanchez is crap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaskillS yes mate. Got to keep my options open. Much easier walking to and from work today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y I’m 37 mate. #ancient.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kevin_traynor75 @SDoughtyMP @grangecardiff problem is @cardiffcouncil are more interested in free city centre wifi than clean streets.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SDoughtyMP thanks Stephen. Sorry to get you involved. 😃<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ealinglevy @AlunEbenezer I’ll have a word for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ealinglevy @AlunEbenezer I heard you were good at sorting out your own pass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ealinglevy @AlunEbenezer you still banned levy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlunEbenezer are you joining us at #Aber16?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis you seemed to forget most of your clothes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattyWebber88 @GarethJWebber that’s harsh. Some of the best sports people in the world at olympics. Can’t be said of Eurovision.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCastellini @cardiffcouncil @cccfails but some people don’t care and that’s where the council needs to step up and fine them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeCastellini @cardiffcouncil @cccfails it’s not their fault it’s everyone else’s and the seagulls.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarethJWebber @MattyWebber88 alternatively it’s great for people who just love sport full stop!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoddfaJohn #Aber16 John. #Aber16. 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla they ain’t as bad as the old lenor ones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla 2. Ours and a @Wrexham_AFC fans one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla I’ve reactivated the league.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@posh_esther got to get it all done before #Aber16. Woke up early so came in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla woke up at silly time. Cleared all my email already.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @wayne_1603 @fmwales Wayne - basses on @ArrivaTW previous tweets, trains being overcrowded is the customer’s fault.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know you’re in work early when the air conditioning hasn’t even been switched on yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realMChalmers looks unbelievable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cerys_Ruth where’s that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesvobrien they don’t see it though. They’re blinded.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y @bakke171 @Trevla keep that ice on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bakke171 @Trevla @dev2y didn’t devs do it blocking the ball?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y @bakke171 he is trustworthy - you are whites.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gruffter football is the only occupation where you can get sacked and still move to a better job straight away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanG1878 @thatphillad he’s a great talker. How?! I’m flabbergasted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thatphillad phenomenal, isn’t it?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ILovesTheDiff agree. What are @cardiffcouncil doing to enforce it. Same people leaving rubbish out around the Broadway each week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How?!  https://t.co/HV7MCZ62Nh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theDaveThomas82 @CezDavis I only caught the end of it. Was with the walkers going around Roath park lake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrdanwalker you seem to have a lot of hair coming from your wrist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis you always have to take things one step too far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis that was amazing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y footy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok. A bit premature on the rain stopping. #tuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least it’s stopped raining. #tuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanG1878 @cardiffcouncil @TheA4232 they’ve not got a clue about how to provide decent infrastructure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AW15_ anyone from Roath etc just has to sit in the traffic, either in their car or on a bus. No foresight @cardiffcouncil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A journey that should take 15 mins tops took 50 mins. When will @cardiffcouncil sort out transport leaving the city to the east?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What on earth is going with the #traffic in #Cardiff tonight?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a beautiful city Cardiff is. @ILovesTheDiff @cardiffcouncil  https://t.co/NeKHhufdkh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@huwtroberts @FAWales and if he manages it he’ll get a better job than Hull.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cerys_Ruth you’re middle aged.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @Bigt8409 @therealfootsie He got benched in training camp yesterday apparently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @Trevla @therealfootsie Sanchez has been benched already!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OJDBROWN busy last 20 mins?  https://t.co/2C9RqNhh4b<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y colours tomorrow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gethin_aj looked like furniture/rubbish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gethin_aj it’s right by work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tim_Rigney @CJ__Cregg @thewestwingTV that’s another great episode but not as sad as this one. Poor CJ.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is there a sadder episode of @thewestwingTV thank the last one of series 3?! Poor @CJ__Cregg.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y footy sir?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sam_a_liu Calon lan is my favourite. 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sam_a_liu you seem to be in the choir?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t drive in bus lanes? #simple  https://t.co/C4CGnTHaUK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @therealfootsie what you mean?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y you’re whites<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y ok.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y i have someone unless you already have.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y on 13 at the mo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clairalou @smileyrhi I had friends from school (in north wales) retweeting that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great to get home to this tshirt from @Art_of_Football. #halrobsonkanu #TogetherStronger  https://t.co/ycpx4cKtiw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 no worries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 another space has opened up… Fancy it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y do you ahve a mate who could play? We’re at 13.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 scrap that. Space gone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 want a game tomorrow?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y footy sir?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>According to @ArrivaTW overcrowded trains are the customers’ fault not down to them not having enough carriages.  https://t.co/uPO1B2OfdP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla so its your fault the train is full.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @ArrivaTW here’s the 8:19 at Cogan. I took a pic from the platform.  https://t.co/o2IK5rOWUH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @ArrivaTW bet the air conditioning is a welcome relief though. Oh wait…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gruffter @extratimeaber @__davidlewis can imagine @mbarnes saying that at #Aber16.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alanepetersen @amandapetersen2 Jenna hates flying but thought the south west US was more than worth it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alanepetersen Canada is awesome too. The Grand Canyon is just mental though. Takes your breath away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alanepetersen Phoenix is probably nearest and Vegas is 4 hours away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alanepetersen we did a San Fran, Yosemite, Death Valley, Vegas, Canyon, LA and big sur road trip. Flew to &amp; from SF.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alanepetersen nope. That’s an old one from Oct last year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#sunset at the #grandcanyon.  https://t.co/rtlSakHpPH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gruffter @extratimeaber gambling for maoams is ok, surely? 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gruffter loads. There should be an @extratimeaber sweepstake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ginge_1 New Hampshire is beautiful, Boston is cool and NYC is plain bonkers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ginge_1 3 of my favourite places in the US. Been before?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ginge_1 @Danirichards23 where you going?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis that’s right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guess which one of the two of us bought which book…  https://t.co/bfr0MQl0S4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesvobrien yeh. Someone else tweeted the same thing. Will do that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarlHogan sorry to hear that Carl. Glad he’s getting better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rhodrielisjones thanks for the recommendation. Will have to find it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching @TheWalkMovie. Bonkers to think it’s a true story. Who walks between the twin towers on a tightrope!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@R_Hennessy haha. That’s awesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@David_Moose this is our 4th time. Gets better each time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis yep. Love that scene.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis haha. How dare you mention those in the same breath!! 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is no better episode of any TV programme than “Two Cathedrals”, the last episode of season two of the #WestWing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dgmcnee @MiriamMcNee it’s US election year, what other reason do you need?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dgmcnee @thewestwingTV this is the 3rd time. Gets better each one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The last 5 episodes of season two of the @thewestwingTV have to be some of the best TV ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y whites mate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 no worries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 footy mate? Have space.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hdotjones Vegas is bonkers. Enjoy!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y I left @jamskipotatoe in charge. It all went wrong!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y no mate; was off. Partly as I was in Lyon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y footy mate?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#brooklyn #newyorkcity #nyc #newyork  https://t.co/TtYN4UL8eu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Crazy thing is the @NRA will use this as a reason for people to have guns. Absolutely bonkers.  https://t.co/9z8aj5ReWp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daihankey nice. Love California. You there with church related stuff?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daihankey where are you in the states bro?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darrenshorty5 didn’t claim it wasn’t effective. Just don’t understand how anyone would want them to win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smileyrhi haha. Yep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smileyrhi with Ramsay we’d have won the whole thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smileyrhi yes but every Portugal game has been like this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thatphillad who had the 1st?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How any one can want Portugal to win is beyond me. It’s like watching paint dry. They are so negative. #EURO2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guess that’s why you support Arsenal.  https://t.co/GAWfKe4qMg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WildFire_79 @indy100 I want to bang my head against a wall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wil5y @OliverKayTimes @TimesSport you’ve missed the point of the whole article. Success is not always about coming first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wil5y @OliverKayTimes @TimesSport did you read the article? You seem to have spectacularly missed the point made.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cb260Ac @andrealeadsom @thetimes don’t worry. She’s a mother. She’ll be amazing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Breninal1978 no. On our way back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#france is beautiful.  https://t.co/qhTWwgI7Th<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tpassmore93 @ben_keen86 @PDHarrisarts he wishes he was us. 😉On a serious not Ben was bang on. Missed Ramsay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaskillS @theDaveThomas82 @therealfootsie @R_Hennessy my view  https://t.co/3tS7hkoCSw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Disappointed but loved every second. #togetherstronger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @SkySportsNewsHQ have you turned into the dad of Twitter today or something?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3:30am at a random services in France. Full of Welsh. #Togetherstronger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @principalitysta @FAWales so 14,000 more people can be there?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaskillS all the best for today sir!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smileyrhi it’s showing on BBC on sky planner<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis yes but you also thought you had to open your laptop from the back…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smileyrhi I’ve got a ticket!! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis need to work on the brightness of that light.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickjwoolley congratulations!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Imanstah @BartHubbuch Homer Simpson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These are terrible penalties. #GERITA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis #Hummels is very old then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sreb1 enjoy your holiday!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeffo365 @Jamin2g that’s the cost of democracy isn’t it?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeffo365 @Jamin2g get over what? The cornerstone of democracy is free speech. Democracy means they can protest. Get over it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jamin2g @jeffo365 why is it odd? People can protest. Democracy means you just don’t shut up if you disagree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is even more awesome in German.  https://t.co/SQ3nvaDTbc  #WALBEL #TogetherStronger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrdanwalker they were brilliant interviews Dan. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rhodrielisjones you made it onto @BBCNews. :)  https://t.co/5PGlOkhnhF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y @therealfootsie agreed. They were no mugs like Russia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someone talk to him…  https://t.co/zM8FQaS2M4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bakke171 how many England players would get in this team?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaskillS @theDaveThomas82 @therealfootsie @R_Hennessy lost for words.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EFCStats forget witzel. Ramsay and Allen ran the show.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samwood2345 @GaryLineker name many better at a euros…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>. @GaryLineker “one of the great performances in British football”. #Togetherstronger #WALBEL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tears rolling down. #Togetherstronger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s never a penalty @RobbieSavage8.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GriffinSpurs the refereeing has been garbage all game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smileyrhi there’s no need to be gutted whatever happens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aaron Ramsay has been out of this world tonight. #WALBEL #Togetherstronger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is just like the first half. Must get tighter in our half. #WALBEL #Togetherstronger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y yep. We gave them too much space for the first 20. since then virtually all us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unbelievable game. #WALBEL #Togetherstronger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ohwhatagaz the officiating has been poor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smileyrhi were not getting anything from the officials<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can say what you want about closing that down but nothing was stopping that shot. #WALBEL #Togetherstronger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are far too open. Need to tighten up. #WALBEL #Togetherstronger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cerys_Ruth @FAWales I’ve had cider. Needed something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cerys_Ruth @FAWales I feel sick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on @FAWales. We’re all behind you. #Togetherstronger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GriffinSpurs only messing. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GriffinSpurs most predictable tweet of the night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamgoman82 me too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wacobjilkins love Josh. My favourite character.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andyjlogan1 @FolkyGaz @martyn_joseph catch him live. He’s even better there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 probably for the best. We had people asking to be in the other team last time you played.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The_Goat9 @wayne_1603 either of you fancy football tomorrow?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gruffter @jeremycorbyn @UKParliament As long as they're the right principles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BazAveyard Frightening. If I lost the support of 80% of the people who worked for me, I'd be out of a job very quickly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What good do these people think keeping Corbyn will do?! Do they honestly believe they'll win an election? #keepcorbyn #CorbynOut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LauraMuse_ do you think the electorate would vote far left?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dazbcfcwales and I thought us Welsh were bitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesvobrien he’s nice though!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickjwoolley @sam_a_liu that’s the worst one though, surely?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickjwoolley @sam_a_liu that was terrible from an English point of view.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samwood2345 and you thought the last game was bad!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NEPD_Loyko most overrated player in the EPL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@punditsfolly @andrew_loose I think it thought what England thought. Interesting article -  https://t.co/ta3hGaCaIe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kategilson @jessphillips @BartonBank the extreme left are more like the extreme right than they like to admit,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is funny. Joe hart. #ENGICE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrew_loose @punditsfolly I don’t trust a Tory government to give the billions the EU has to Wales.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y footy mate?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@punditsfolly it was far easier for leave to paint a rosy picture of the future. Remain didn’t even try.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@punditsfolly I don’t think most people understood much about the EU. They were annoyed so voted out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@punditsfolly the positive story is the amount of investment in Wales. All of which will disappear with a Tory government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@punditsfolly it was just a poorly run, negative campaign from start to finish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@punditsfolly what they didn’t realise was the press was on the opposite side on the whole whereas in Scotland they were on the same side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@punditsfolly the press held an interesting role too. Remain tried to run the same campaign as in the Scottish referendum<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@punditsfolly I don’t have one (nor do most) but the right wing press in particular peddles there is an issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@punditsfolly it was a poorly run campaign from start to finish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@punditsfolly I’d have also dealt with the issue of immigration head on. You can’t laugh at people and call them all racists etc…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@punditsfolly I’d have shown how much of the infrastructure in the Valleys etc has been paid for by the EU.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@punditsfolly I’d have ran a campaign in Wales fronted by Labour and Plaid. It was a big mistake to keep it London and Tory centric.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@punditsfolly I haven’t once said the remain campaign was positive. In fact they didn’t try to run a positive campaign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@punditsfolly people hear what they want to. The leave campaign played on that. We’ll now live with the consequences.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@punditsfolly neither was a positive campaign. I don’t think the electorate though they were “suggesting alternatives”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@punditsfolly It’s far easier to run a campaign knowing u won’t have to implement what you say. As for NHS, even Farage though it a mistake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@punditsfolly that’s the beauty of the leave campaign though, isn’t it?! Plant the seeds in the electorate, knowing they couldn’t deliver.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@punditsfolly in what way sir?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BartonBank @SocialistVoice a socialist voting for UKIP?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis “bantz” does not equal personality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis pot… Kettle… Black…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All we need with the @Conservatives in disarray &amp; moving to the right is for @UKLabour to lurch to the left. #BREXIT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StarbarMurray they’ve already done a good enough job of that themselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aaron Ramsay has picked the wrong option every time he has had the ball. #wal #EURO2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 @Jonny_Ol needs to take Vokes off and put Robson-Kanu on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 @Jonny_Ol it was always going to be like this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmwrexham I just said that to someone:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alanepetersen all dual carriageway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amandapetersen2 @alanepetersen @Bethjpetersen it’s a good, quick road to kamloops.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did people really then they would get this funding if they voted out?! Really?!  https://t.co/LiJfuZiAAX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yesacuiby @cardiffonline @KESands @Leejones2510lj give them a chance. It’s barely been 24 hours.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Here we go. #BREXIT  https://t.co/rXPwRtjo5i<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Leejones2510lj @AW15_ agreed. Just pointing out that there wasn’t an overwhelming majority.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Leejones2510lj @AW15_ 16.1 mil are wrong. Far closer than everyone makes out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dylanfbrady a parcel arrived for you at ours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nestajames1 @Offsidemccaw how’s how badly the remain campaign got their message across.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LifeofRiley6 @GwynDavies95 um Boris etc?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BartonBank where’s that by?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BartonBank random Q. Where’s a good place in London to watch the football tomorrow?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AgentAvalon it’s ok though. Boris is a laugh. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree wholeheartedly with this.  https://t.co/HTekZ2mpLI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Leejones2510lj I don’t. It just in the one conversation we had about #EUref it was the reason you mentioned.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Leejones2510lj what did you think of @DanHannanMEP saying immigration wouldn’t go down?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis I’m crying on the inside.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanG1878 indeed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darrandowey in his own said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bet @BorisJohnson is happy with that. #cameronsgone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haven’t seen @jeremycorbyn looking so happy for weeks. #EUref<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It won’t. #EUref  https://t.co/rzozuog2Ol<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Trevla @British_Airways they’re just like @ArrivaTW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesvobrien watched them all. Awesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrew_loose yes I did. Can we take you up on 14th please!?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis make sure you do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just cast my vote in the #EURef.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickjwoolley don’t worry. We’ll blow it against Northern Ireland.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pete_Gillibrand @WalesOnline it was a complete farce.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The moderator in this @BBCWales #euref debate is dreadful. Let the person who’s answering the question speak and make the others be quiet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrissOConnell @WalesPolitics the dreadful moderating hasn’t helped.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got to say @BBCWales have picked a terrible audience. Too many entrenched on both sides of the #euref debate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. @UKIP AM says there was nothing wrong with their Nazi inspired poster. Even @Nigel_Farage kind of apologised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear, dear. @fmwales and @LeanneWoodAM are making a right hash of this.  #EUref<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomLondon6 @SarahBazzer it’s like the 1930s all over again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darrandowey haha. Nothing would surprise me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Wrexham have just signed someone called Nortei Nortey. (No really!!)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drmarchant1 we’ll lose to turkey.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alanepetersen positive. 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drmarchant1 we’ll lose to them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smileyrhi we’ll lose to Either,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smileyrhi we’ll lose to NiR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smileyrhi does this mean that Germany, Italy, France, Spain and England are in the same half of the draw.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gappy76  https://t.co/zxNJe9JdLP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rhodrielisjones @robphillipshere where can you listen to that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @therealfootsie we’re off to London for her birthday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @therealfootsie can’t now. I’d have a divorce.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie @bigsimon69 @rab2410 gutted I can’t come with you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can’t wait to see you… 😃  https://t.co/KlK6Kf72NA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattCarrel unbelievable tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have a little faith. There’s magic in the night. #wal #euro2016 #walrus #ruswal #springsteen #Togetherstronger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattCarrel that pass.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You just know we’re going to mess this up somehow. #RUSWAL #WALRUS come on #wal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is there a more odious politician than Nigel Farage?! #EURef #VoteRemain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JordanGPrice @thewestwingTV agreed. First three seasons are TV genius.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching @thewestwingTV. Goodbye 2016.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brianmoore666 it would be just like watching Wales.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis you are a moron.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Night to myself. Watching the #shawshankredemption.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis you're not that good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis only just saw this. just another reason not to watch ITV.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HayleyTamplin @theDaveThomas82 I’m gutted too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HayleyTamplin hope he’s not too sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You knew it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What on earth was Ashley Williams trying to do?! #EngWal #EURO2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was terrible defending. #EngWal #EURO2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SionWilliams and me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can you imagine #eng fans if they’d had a penalty given against them for that. #ENGWAL #EURO2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cerys_Ruth good point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cerys_Ruth I’m still waiting.  😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cerys_Ruth you’ve grown up! Haha 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarethJWebber watching it in work. No hiding behind the couch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarethJWebber I feel sick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel sick. Come on #WAL. #Euro2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darrandowey I’ve seen that somewhere before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yesacuiby hope you’re right. I’m as nervous as.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisphillips20 I don’t think we organised it. They came and asked to do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisphillips20 it was a #voteremain session. Not a debate. I enjoyed it though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @jamskipotatoe watch Buffon…  https://t.co/9sVLN3llNA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesvobrien agreed. We’re not built to play from behind, we’re built to counter. Good thing is England have to come at us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesvobrien there’s our team talk. As you said, they never learn.  We’ve got to park the bus on Thursday and hit them on the break.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesvobrien you seen what Wiltshire said?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realMChalmers @BBCSport thank you sir.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis well they missed some chances.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis Germany and Spain looked good too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis Belgium overrated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never write off the Italians. #EURO2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattCarrel indeed. Best burger I’ve had in there and that’s saying something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattCarrel lamb burger with Feta and a tomato type sauce. Was lovely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just had the Holy Bale burger from @TheGrazingShed. I’m lost for words. #bestburgerever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe bet you can resonate with this.  https://t.co/cc32jKkvx3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t like the new @instagram algorithm. What was wrong with having everything in date order?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@moore_moore22 @mrjakehumphrey are you over there?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@moore_moore22 @mrjakehumphrey never the English fans fault, is it?! (Though I get the stuff in the stadium was the Russians).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 @mrjakehumphrey the Russians are bonkers but England fans have hardly been innocent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrjakehumphrey what about the havoc England fans have been causing all week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do @FIFAcom still think that holding the @FIFAWorldCup in #RUS is still a good idea? #EURO2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Owain_Thomas that's exactly what it was like to watch at home too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DafPritchard @Tada1973 it’s physically impossible for us to do that. A draw should be enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbutler1978 and that includes Bale and Ramsay as probably our two worst players on the whole.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe agreed. It’ll be interesting to see what happens when we play Russia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry. 3 former @Wrexham_AFC playing today. Forgot about Joe Allen’s loan spell. #Wal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe in fairness I don’t think the ruski’s are innocent in it all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Joe Allen has been out of this world. #WALSVK #wal #bbceuro2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smileyrhi he’s been dreadful. Bale no better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We deserve to be winning despite Bale (the goal aside) and Ramsey having poor games so far. #WALSVK #bbceuro2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And meanwhile in Marseille…  https://t.co/RlkXgNLUGC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe it’s not a Thursday night…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There’s going to be a least one red card in this game. Players are getting frustrated with inconsistent refereeing. #WALSVK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is that not a penalty?! #WALSVK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis only you could be watching Wales in their first tournament for 50 years and spend the whole game tweeting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benfides no doubt. That was epic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GriffinSpurs agreed. However it’s always the English.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow.  #WALSVK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great to see two former @Wrexham_AFC players in the @FAWales team today. #WALSVK #bbceuro2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So here we go. #TogetherStronger #WALSVK #bbceuro2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EECNewport @BBCWalesNews @alandavey @gruffter that’s Pat! 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big chance missed by Wales. New Zealand were there for the taking today. #NZLvWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 yeah but if you’re going to beat them you have to take chances.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 our attackung decision making in the 22 is diabolical. 21 potential points that we butchered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanG1878 that’s the only difference.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JiffyRugby @taulupe best number 8 in the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesvobrien he’s dreadful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wayne Barnes at his best. Ignore the obvious forward pass in the first half and then give one that is 50/50 at best. #NZLvWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s much less forward than the one in the first half. #NZLvWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That’s all folks. #NZLvWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wales back to their overlap wasting best. Big chance. #NZLvsWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbutler1978 you know it. We’ve been superb so far though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realMChalmers great game of rugby.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like we’ve decided that our best chance to beat the All Blacks is to attack from everywhere. #NZLvsWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anyone who doubts Faletau is the best number 8 in world rugby needs to watch #NZLvsWAL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 he has no flow for the feel of the game so they become stop start.   Good try but they are a level above us. NZL by 20.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 he’s a poor ref not a biased ref. Generally blows his whistle too much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. Wales just executed an overlap. First time since 2005. #NZLvWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanG1878 their club competitions are streets ahead of the pro12 let alone the super rugby.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanG1878 there’s a huge difference between the teams. We’ll do well to keep the gap below 20 based on the fist 5 mins.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wayne Barnes. My favourite. 🙄 #NZLvWAL #NZvWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CardiffUniCU i was a @USWCU_treforest player back in the day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CardiffUniCU not sure it was me…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y white mate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clairalou surely voting for Hilary for any reason is better than voting for @realDonaldTrump?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Our_Earth_Pics @MrGazJones I’ve been there. Beautiful place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Managed to nip out of work to see the #Queen. #Queens90th  https://t.co/4D7zgzSmTI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y footy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattyWebber88 bonkers, isn't it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@paulmwrexham @huwtroberts what’s that about?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@huwtroberts ok. Won’t get my hopes up for number 3.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watched The Godfather for the first time. How have I never seen that movie before?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis @gruffter @sam_a_liu @ChloeMeasday Sam - this could turn into #cyclegate if we’re not careful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gruffter @sam_a_liu @ChloeMeasday I’d prefer to eat the dust off the floor of verdi’s than let my lips touch a Joes. #honest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y colours<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChloeMeasday @HuwFulcher @sam_a_liu joes is fine if you just like vanilla.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cerys_Ruth you’ve changed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smileyrhi haha. If we play to our best, we'll beat England.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie they'll still be there if we vote out. Boris is just a charlatan. All about becoming the next Tory leader.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@smileyrhi it'll make it all the sweeter when we beat them...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3 reasons to vote remain:  1) Michael Gove 2) Nigel Farage 3) Boris Johnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y already done. And gloves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y footy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beautiful Wales. #glandyfi #machynlleth @DerekTheWeather  https://t.co/tZQ96nSZlG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>. @ygwyll country was looking amazing yesterday. @BBCWales #hinterland #wales  https://t.co/PEWITdiOPt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lovely day down the beach with family. Can’t beat Mid Wales in the sunshine.  https://t.co/bzJDG39hFD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis yep. Go and enjoy it. 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis glad you’re enjoying. It is totally bonkers. Makes you realise how small Cardiff is!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis was it good? Mental place, isn’t it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis no. Just pick a restaurant and go for it. 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis did they let you in?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tada1973 @pwillow123 @markbutler1978 I can choose to believe the world is flat. That doesn’t make it true. 1 yr deals are a gamble.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis you’re on your own.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @British_Airways yes. You could watch movies, eat food, listen to music. Why do you need your phone?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @British_Airways what would you do on your phone anyway?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @British_Airways not if you’re in economy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattCarrel @dev2y if someone can pay £10 they can be free next week. 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattCarrel @dev2y can you make sure someone pays please. 😃 whoever collects the money will get a free week if you’ve got 14…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y yes mate. I believe so. I’m not there.  Got family down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lovely day in #Cardiff Bay. Not so lovely sunburn though.  https://t.co/j0ToQPoEMG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Richkay71 @eaglepark36 @NFL it’ll be the  bills next or any other NFL team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eaglepark36 @NFL @Richkay71 the NFL will pick on whatever team suits them. #bountygate was proof of that. Which team will be next?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Richkay71 @NFL @AdamSchefter put simply, they’ve made it all up. It’s a total non-story made into a story by @nflcommish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis just like McDonald’s? Total bombshell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis another bombshell moment announced on Twitter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now this is a sandwich. Thanks @CoffeeBarker.  https://t.co/RoOXLkWmRk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kevin_traynor75 lovely day down the Gower.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#wales  https://t.co/XHcKyF32sD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y you in for footy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WillGav @Gridiron @NFL you may find it boring but I’d be fighting on if I was punished for something I didn’t do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @GameOfThrones you’re going on holiday. Watch it when you get back!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NEPD_Loyko the @principalitysta is easily the best stadium in the UK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @thatphillad so that was a real genuine tweet. Wow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis has @thatphillad hacked your Twitter?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cardiffbus do you have a link?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just forced off the road and onto the pavement by @Cardiffbus no 50 driving down the Broadway at full speed. #baddriving<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#california  https://t.co/qxUFYbaEt5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y can’t believe you worked it out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y whites<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @AW15_ the irony!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @AW15_ my 2nd point is valid. You lot give it out more than anyone. Now you have to take your medicine. #ForzaSevilla 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @AW15_ you’re such a big fan you were busy moisturising you feet.  Liverpool fans give it out more than anyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesvobrien best fans in the world though. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @thatphillad trust you to come out of the woodwork in a final…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thatphillad especially Liverpool fans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cavaliere_sal it doesn’t appear to be a very big team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbutler1978 agreed. I was underwhelmed by it all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fearlessidzine yep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wrexham_AFC it’s not working on @youtube<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wrexham_AFC says the live event has ended.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y footy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sam_a_liu @posh_esther  https://t.co/nET5xEqzDC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well #undercover was clearly ended like that for a second series.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Final instalment of #undercover.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@A_Raz9 @FGRFC_Official @AFCRD @TheNonLeagueMag yep. And that went well… #wherearetheynow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @Nigel_Farage’s spin on this is that there are so many Polish immigrants in different countries they all voted for Poland. #Eurovision<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis course they are! Least we’d get to hear the epic line about “feeling your love through FaceTime” again though…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nerve wrecking or nerve wracking?! #Eurovision<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Banjalero @agcu4181 walkabout bar?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can always rely on the Maltese.  #twelvepoints #eurovision<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There’s a mosaic somewhere missing some pieces. #Austria #eurovision<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis yeah. That happened for real last year. They were taking the mick out of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis that was the best song.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pink6butterfly @therealfootsie @Stand_by_G haha. 😃 Touché! 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis if only they’d let me and @murph_stephen duet “under the sea”. We’d have won #eurovision.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis the U.K. one was good too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis did you see the racecourse in the montage before it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaskillS and we had the home of the mighty @Wrexham_AFC in the montage before it. #winning #eurovision<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was the @My_Racecourse! Love it. #eurovision #wales<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis no idea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie @pink6butterfly @Stand_by_G and we thought his quick dashes home was for something else when it was to practice this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis we’re next to last.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pink6butterfly @Stand_by_G @therealfootsie so we know what he’s good at now!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis there’s been nothing too weird tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis what term would you prefer I used?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis the slit on her dress is so high it reaches to her ovaries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y I thought so. 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y trade off for watching footy last night and earlier. Ill also get to watch Wednesday’s game too. 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is she wearing a 6 man tent? #croatia #cro #eurovision<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaskillS only in Lithuania and Liverpool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PhoebeWedding no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaskillS that was better than anything so far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did she really just sing, “trying to find your love through FaceTime?!” #eurovision #AUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Think that joke was better in Swedish. #eurovision<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Les Mis does #eurovision. #Poland #pol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did she look in the mirror before she went on stage?! #ger #Eurovision<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To think Sweden once produced Abba. This is dreadful. #Eurovision #SWE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“If love was a crime, we’d both be criminals.“ I’ll have to try that line on Jenna sometime. #BUL #eurovision<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How small is that guy’s head?! #HUN #Eurovision<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaskillS not a bad start. Nothing too weird.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaskillS just stay on Twitter. It makes it bearable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If we vote no, will we still have to compete in #Eurovision next year? #BREXIT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Eurovision is what Twitter was made for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sam_a_liu yes. #Twitter was made for #Eurovision.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was there no better pic to use?  https://t.co/nm9tlBuVpX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @dev2y @AroundTheNFL this one should be better but it’s always crap teams<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @dev2y @AroundTheNFL always get bored of hard knocks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y colours mate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gwladrugby opportunist politics. Just get on and govern the country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y @MattCarrel @murph_stephen found this pic of @jamskipotatoe  https://t.co/TyEfJ3ZLpu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y could be worse. Could support Everton.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanG1878 @Leejones2510lj I’ll never follow that red team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is Roberto Martinez still @Everton manager? He’s successfully turned the team into Wigan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanG1878 @Everton @EvertonArentWe he’ll still be there next season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @Trevla haha. That’s good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichFay_ @CarlHogan I’m happy to be used if you need people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y footy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoddfaJohn nice. Have a good time!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Banjalero @kevin_traynor75 #Eurovision is what Twitter was made for,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing lIke a bit of #rain to bring #Cardiff to a standstill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yesacuiby first motd of next season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Catching up on #undercover. More great drama from the @BBC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ohwhatagaz I’ve been tweeting that for 3 weeks and he’s still there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidpmitchell @extratimeaber what’s pigeonhole?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thatphillad @JordanGPrice that’d be like a dream come true for Jord.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie not yet. Looks mint though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @Wrexham_AFC no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie what do you make of this bad boy?  https://t.co/houLwMAgxT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GS_WAFC @WSTfundraising @Wrexham_AFC @Rocke11 that looks mint!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got to love @Wrexham_AFC fans. Spend all season moaning the squad isn’t good enough and then moan that most of the squad is released.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hillerzz @dixiessixty he’d miss his hands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fearlessidzine so they’re only back if they can’t get anything else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fearlessidzine when are they supposed to impress him?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gwladrugby I’m no Labour supporter but are you looking at the same results as me?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y @jamskipotatoe white mate. Money to Jamo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbutler1978 @78Spirit maybe it’s indicative that the manager thinks they’re not good enough?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y @jamskipotatoe footy gents?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis that’s not the point either of you were making.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis nonsense. At the end of 38 games, you finish where you deserve to be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoddfaJohn a great player on his day. Been too inconsistent this season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoddfaJohn yep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@posh_esther @realMChalmers don’t listen to Chalmers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoddfaJohn they lost the plot tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@posh_esther why the support for Spurs?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis Spurs have lost the plot. Should be down to 8 men.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Clattenburg has lost control of this. #chetot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GriffinSpurs how can you moan about the ref? Spurs should be down to 9!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 dembele would have a huge ban if it was rugby.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ILovesTheDiff 20c by Saturday…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lovely sunset down the bay. @ILovesTheDiff  https://t.co/Rgy7Qz9SZi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dylanfbrady the cgi was amazing. Just like you said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @TheJungleBook was well worth a watch. Brilliant adaptation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @IanG1878 yeah yeah.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @IanG1878 if that’s what it’s auto corrected to, what are you normally typing about?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ginge_1 I saw you twice!! 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JCP_14_ obviously his first season watching us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OJDBROWN @emmanuelcardiff we’re looking forward to having you and are VERY #EXPECTANT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@parisgeth I’m with you. And it’s why I’ll be voting yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y whites mate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BartonBank and me. Unbelievable piece of writing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm no fan of Liverpool FC but people shouldn't go to a football match and never come home  https://t.co/eJlEIIh7R2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fearlessidzine showed improvement but could and should have achieved more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatriotsExtra @Colts @Ravens that wasn't the issue. The issue being judged on was whether Goodell has the right to do what he did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @therealfootsie @Bigt8409 a better attempt but still below par.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @therealfootsie @Bigt8409 your trolling gets worse by the second. You'll have to try harder than that... haha.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jmduk the ones in the dvla type place? Genius<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y footy mate?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarlHogan well done Carl! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 you’re like Darren Anderton.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Leejones2510lj @IanG1878 in one interview he claimed Everton were getting better each season!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@philmcnulty @grandoldteam he’s bonkers. We’re getting worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ajwoolley83 this was a top day!!  https://t.co/HUt4qVyOPj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ohwhatagaz “phenomenal”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrdanwalker you could say the same about that whole Everton team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benfides there’s no structure to the game and no discipline.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benfides yes sorry. He’s turned them into Wigan. That team should be top 5.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benfides good players, poor manager. #MartinezOut<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @ColleenWolfeNFL @therealfootsie @Bigt8409 and the patriots will still win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ohwhatagaz your sister has decided to support Liverpool again after their win last week. Shocking. @CezDavis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 good stuff. Good to have you back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 footy mate?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @cardiffcouncil they go from one extreme to another. Usual is leaving rubbish to rot all over the street.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y bad times…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y footy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good old @cardiffcouncil cleaning drains at 7:20am.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanG1878 I agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanG1878 and people wonder why Everton fans want him gone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y most underrated player in the premiership.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y he made the difference. Great player.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattCarrel Joe Allen. Turned the game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It also gives Liverpool fans another game to talk about for the next 30 years. #LIVBVB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a bonkers game of football. #LIVBVB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y colours mate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bakke171 no worries. Knew it was a long shot.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Trevla @therealfootsie @Bigt8409 wow. Your pinning your hope on Kap. He got benched for Gabbert.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ginge_1 she was amazing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Breninal1978 you’d better not be listening to Monty!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jamesvobrien that’s awesome. Great video.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ohwhatagaz @thatphillad I think we could keep him had we not been so poor and that is why Martinez must go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thatphillad @ohwhatagaz this is bang on…  https://t.co/x0DWKNUTzL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @MattCarrel see you in work tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @MattCarrel why do you think it’s broken other than the fact you’re a big girl?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y colours sir<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaskillS a group of people who feel disenfranchised coupled with the economic problems we've had creates this mess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaskillS @Channel4 the parallels between this and what happened in Germany in the early 1930s are mental.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@r77ulr @WSTtweets @Wrexham_AFC I will do but need to find my id number.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This @Channel4 documentary on #Trump is bonkers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MR51CUK @simonwxm the club has lost money for years and you need an owner who plugs the gaps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y @cardiffcouncil that joke was trash.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cardiffcouncil @NigelHowellsCdf I’m  still waiting for details from the council about how I can complain on email to them. (2/2)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cardiffcouncil @NigelHowellsCdf this was taken today. It’s been like this for 7 days. (1/2)  https://t.co/nhqRcCb3kL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bakke171 fancy footy tomorrow?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ColinMHolmes @Trader_Joe77 @MrHeskey @brianmoore666 he’s never been outside Nevada let alone across the Atlantic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tada1973 couldn’t believe what he was saying. He has is own agenda I guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis very good. Can’t believe I hadn’t seen it before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watched @UnbrokenFilm. Great movie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y @jamskipotatoe one week 6 players and last week was cancelled due to Wales v Northern Ireland.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y @jamskipotatoe footy this week?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeaderRich clearly hit him on the TV.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here we go… Dean Saunders… “The club loses money every year.” No Dean, we made a profit last year. #WxmAFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Usual Dean Saunders comment moaning about the money at @Wrexham_AFC. Club made first profit in 15 years last season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So… The last episode of #thenightmanager.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Easter pavlova  https://t.co/p3EcJpwhXR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Terry_Nutkin @JoeLedleysBeard that’ll only get worse as the English media builds up this next “golden generation”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Terry_Nutkin @JoeLedleysBeard any true fan would prefer qualification. If you were asking me, I’d like both.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Terry_Nutkin @JoeLedleysBeard what’s said on here to wind people up is different to real life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Terry_Nutkin @JoeLedleysBeard I’m not seeing any of that. Most would choose qualifying but at the same time we’d love to beat England.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveBuckley11 indeed. They don’t have an answer for Bale even with everyone fit. They can be attacked. Tonight shows we can’t just defend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveBuckley11 they did look good tonight but England frequently look good outside a major tournament.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What happened to the golden generation of English footballers that hammered Germany 5-1?! #GerVEng<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got to love #GerVEng - every English pundit will be bigging them up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drmarchant1 did they get the socks the wrong way round?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drmarchant1 worse than this one?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cerys_Ruth now that is proper tea!! Cannot beat @YorkshireTea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cerys_Ruth you go 6 weeks without tea and then you drink that stuff?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching Saving Private Ryan. First 30 minutes are great cinematography. The reality of #dday would have been even worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What on earth are @england wearing?! @DFB_Team_EN is just as bad. #GERENG #GerVEng<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drmarchant1 @NewportRFC huge crowd.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This!!  https://t.co/wmhjtBJhQN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charlieIzzyTed @cardiffcouncil people putting stuff in wrong bags. Just gets left in the street.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cardiffcouncil really…  https://t.co/i8MFINYJqc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’d take them just being able to sort out the rubbish left around parts of the city.  https://t.co/PV4ZE6NWdI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NigelHowellsCdf @cardiffcouncil as its not even by anyone’s house. How long will these ones be left? How can I email a complaint?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NigelHowellsCdf @cardiffcouncil round two is about to commence. The note won’t make any difference (1/2)  https://t.co/At2ON84AXd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NigelHowellsCdf @cardiffcouncil thank you. All cleaned. Happens each week. Am sure new people in flats don’t know what goes in what bag.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cardiffcouncil I just reported it to you on here. I shouldn’t need to report it on the website as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#newyork  https://t.co/QbPQyfMVeB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NigelHowellsCdf Hi - how do I complain to @cardiffcouncil re the rubbish left on Harold Street? 10 days &amp; counting.  https://t.co/wM94hD8cNg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Canada  https://t.co/AmUblLDNva<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@posh_esther the best episode of any tv programme ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nik66Shanahan @Jonny_Ol @therealfootsie @R_Hennessy @JordanGPrice Jordan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And so my record of never having seen @Wrexham_AFC lose to Chester continues. Well worth the trip from Cardiff. #WXMAFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis  https://t.co/hQIzYRkihR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funniest thing is that due to the bubble @ChesterFC fans have to stay watch this.  https://t.co/rWMwBGSQ9e<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis not the brightest are you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1-0 @Wrexham_AFC.  https://t.co/QUE9xQX7Vg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis we’re not bubbled. We’re at home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanG1878 @Everton he’s turned a great team into Wigan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Proper derby. @Wrexham_AFC vs Chester.  https://t.co/PZiL4IIAQO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wrexham_AFC leaving Cardiff for the big game. Cannot wait.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>An old one from Canada. Simply beautiful.  https://t.co/KJ7f58Ctc5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlunEbenezer @aled_salad mistaken for a mature student?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 @__davidlewis in the Ireland game. Three boots to the face. Similar in one sense to Francis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 @__davidlewis I have no issue with Francis getting 8 weeks. Brown and Marler getting nothing though just stinks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lordtimfry they’ve announced both tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y rubbish. Isn’t it?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aled_salad I think @AlunEbenezer looks like he's aged since he was in Emmanuel last.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y no mate. 7 players.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realMChalmers yes. Need to persuade Jenna now. 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realMChalmers just listened to the taster. This could be amazing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeanneWood @gwladrugby don’t the government provide the number of carriages @ArrivaTW use?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnFunnell1 enjoy. I’ve been there twice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sam_a_liu King Cobra. 100%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just bought my ticket for @Wrexham_AFC v Chester. Cannot wait.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 he has nothing of value to add.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BRENINAL1978 it’s ok. Everton lost from this position last week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 @ITVRugby agreed. No meaningful analysis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benfides @__davidlewis @ITVRugby that was clearly still in play mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benfides @__davidlewis @ITVRugby best team won. No doubting that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gwladrugby agreed. Joubert bottled it again though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let’s see if @ITVRugby show the try Wales shouldn’t have had disallowed. #ENGvsWAL #6Nations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“We don’t want to sanitise rugby but we need to look after people’s eye balls”.  #ENGvsWAL #6Nations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lewisroderick he’s been immense. We’ve had a try incorrectly disallowed but that would just mask how much better they’ve been.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis ball is out much quicker.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lewisroderick they fully deserve to be winning by what they are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattyWebber88 and a blatant red card not being given in the last 5 minutes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattyWebber88 Wales are losing because they haven’t been any good. They’ve just had the equivalent of a goal disallowed, pen not given…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Joubert has just killed Wales in that last 5 minutes. #EngvWal #6Nations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 from Joubert?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alanepetersen let’s hope so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alanepetersen his running speed covers over lots of deficiencies. His passing has been dreadful all tournament.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis it’s a shame the thing he gets paid for is to pass the ball.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our distribution from rucks was quicker when Mike Phillips was nine. Daviee is terrible. #EngvWal #6Nations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alanepetersen this is garbage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 cos he’s crap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gareth Davies’ distribution is dreadful. #EngVWal #6Nations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alanepetersen hope you’re right. Have you gone down for it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>England by 8. #ENGvWAL #6Nations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe at least I'd run at space, which is more than can be said of most of the Welsh team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe I'd be the difference maker. Don't call me twinkle toes for nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe reckon we're going to do this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla oh dear…  https://t.co/i6C9fHvytA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sam_a_liu @posh_esther haha. Want to come over at 2pm? Plenty of time to sort stuff out and chat before the game then. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@posh_esther @sam_a_liu want to come to us? Sam the rugby will be on at 4pm if you want to see that too!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lanny_Watkins well done mate.😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y @jamskipotatoe he’s rubbish. Just logged on from home. You’re whites.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y good question. Whites I think. @jamskipotatoe?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @Bigt8409 @MarcSesslerNFL I’m with Trev on this one. With that defence they have a chance to win again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My photos have been accepted on @Shutterstock. The first step to photographic glory.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y yes mate. You in?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla they decide who gets the franchise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @ArrivaTW @networkrail you should let @WelshGovernment know. Franchise is up shortly.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Back in #Cardiff to find that @TheGrazingShed are now on @Deliveroo. This could get dangerous.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ohwhatagaz @CezDavis @thatphillad she’ll be supporting someone else this season if this goes in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ohwhatagaz @CezDavis @thatphillad my guess is Huddersfield.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis after @thatphillad interrupted you to say they’d scored?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis care enough to watch this round?! #parttimers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thatphillad you’d have scored both.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikehughescq @markbutler1978 @GarethPW nor me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarethPW @mikehughescq @Wrexham_AFC Tuesday game was earlier. 2005 maybe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarethPW @mikehughescq @Wrexham_AFC was that an evening game? Drove up from Cardiff for that one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here’s another one from @ygwyll country. #hinterland  https://t.co/Xe53XwrNBz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesvobrien too many rugby referees know the rule book but don’t understand the game. Nigel Owens gets both.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesvobrien yeh. The refereeing of rugby generally is dreadful. Very poor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesvobrien agreed. Used far too much. Foul play is good. Especially when they do it when the game continues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesvobrien agree with that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanG1878 he’s an idiot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesvobrien unless they’re English, there is no doubt there should have been two yellows.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 Ireland are garbage. We’ll be better defensively than them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Poor referring. Should have been two yellows. Haskell and Brown. #ENGvIRE #6Nations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 should be two yellows there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Haskell has to have a yellow for that. #ENGvIRE #6Nations<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Goodbye Ireland. #ENGvIRE #6Nations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 @__davidlewis put Faletau in that team and he’d be as good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis @ben_keen86 I’m going to say it. Faletau is the best 8 in the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 no. He’s speed on his feet means people overlook his dreadful distribution. I’d have given it to the French guy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wrong country @BBCSport   https://t.co/3YcIDe7En5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 consistency would be nice though. 😀 that gets given every week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 I can only see such incidents through one eye though. So you get a better view. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 that was a poor decision. I felt gethin should have had a pen from him. Dreadful game though. Not bad thanks. You?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 never mind the two he should have given to Wales as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That sums Wales up. #WALvFRA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Offsidemccaw I knew you would!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jonny_Ol @BBCScrumV my thoughts exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok… So how many of us saw that coming at the end of the half?! #WALvFRA #6Nations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes he is!  https://t.co/JFpFl89TJl<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The refereeing of rugby is garbage. Spoils games. @WorldRugby  #WALvFRA #6Nations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterMead @realMChalmers bang on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The two best anthems in world rugby. #WALvFRA #bbc6nations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y colours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alexwxm99 @JessGlynne mime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alexwxm99 @JessGlynne hopefully she won’t mine when you see her live.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ealinglevy i'd have presumed he was homeless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y footy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 can you DM me a number for Rhys?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The @Bellagio. #lasvegas  https://t.co/YgStOvYME1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigsimon69 not bad mate. Hope you are too. Your missus works for me now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigsimon69 me too. Haha.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This one’s even better than the last pic. Moraine Lake. #canada  https://t.co/goUPL6L3wx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A gloomy afternoon spent looking at our holiday photos from #Canada in 2014. This one is from #lakelouise.  https://t.co/cfG7y87icM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They’re good but not a patch on @TheGrazingShed.  https://t.co/Bo7aVeGZ2A<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @GomanP @thebodycoach that one got the most pictures on?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y @murph_stephen we’ll have to sort it. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y whites mate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alanepetersen enjoy it. Old town is beautiful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alanepetersen loved Prague. Whereabouts are you staying?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sam_a_liu @USWCU_treforest would never have happened in my days at Ponty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y footy mate?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a plank... there are plenty of charities who would have bitten his hand off for £10k.  https://t.co/hzNeWczTyQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another traumatic episode of #callthemidwife.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alanepetersen nope. #birdflu is possible though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@extratimeaber The cross guarantees me God’s love. #sixwordsermon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlbertBreer unfair cheap shot and you know it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @Trevla good fun for getting a bite out of Trev on a Saturday though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realMChalmers @lewisroderick keep the faith with vern cotter. He’s a good coach.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Catching up on #theXfiles. So far so good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realMChalmers he sounds exactly like Wales do after playing the SH teams.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realMChalmers and he does it often enough for me to virtually pre-quote him word for word.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@L7HNS @gwladrugby the biggest issue was whoever shot out of the line and tackled the wrong man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realMChalmers it’s the same after every game. At some point you must get tired of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GarethJWebber course not. He loves it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing quite like @AndyNic9 and a sense of injustice.  #WALvSCO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cue Andy Nicol… “We were unlucky… We’re getting closer… Etc etc” #WALvSCO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realMChalmers ha ha. I did just laugh out loud when they did it. 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is such a Scotland way to end a game. #WALvSCO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndBethHadley agreed. Personally this is our best back row.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis Lydiate would have sorted out Laidlaw in the first half.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look what running at the gap does for you. #WALvSCO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 and he still got it wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 he’s making it up as he goes along.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis @ben_keen86 we’ll get hammered there if we play like this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 he struggles in any game. A poor referee with no real understanding of the game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is as offside there, not a yellow?!  #WALvSCO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 clancy’s Irish. It’s the norm over there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis I’d have pinged him. No attempt to move.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got to love @AndyNic9 - you’d think they were 3 points up on New Zealand. #WALvSCO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesvobrien he’s certainly the only one that plays what’s in front of him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tipuric is the only player in this Welsh team with a rugby brain. #WALvSCO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s doesn’t matter who’s refereeing, you can always guarantee that Wales will muck up an overlap. #WALvSCO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Clancy refereeing. Anything could happen.  #WALvSCO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @Bigt8409 or alternatively someone whose career has been destroyed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla what was Peyton’s agenda? You tell me? What you reckon @Bigt8409?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @Darrenshorty5 @BobSocci it’s got the court papers attached to it…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @Darrenshorty5 @BobSocci you’re funny… Try reading the article in full.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @Darrenshorty5 @BobSocci well if it’s lies I’m sure Peyton will take them to court like he promised. Oh wait… He didn’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @Darrenshorty5 @BobSocci it would help if you read the article before making up your mind.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @Darrenshorty5 it’s all coming out about the lovely Peyton now.  https://t.co/LJ2ujLiq7h<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alan_Alger_ why does it?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y whites mate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Driving around #Cardiff at the moment is like having a giant game of Labrinth. #avoidthepothole @cardiffcouncil  https://t.co/WP3DKdbWTs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y footy mate?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you’re in #Cardiff - @swpolice have closed Moira Terrace. Causing chaos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WildFire_79 recorded it last night. Will look forward to watching!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WildFire_79 worth watching?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ILovesTheDiff do you know what’s up? Still cordoned off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darrenshorty5 don’t bite… ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Reached the point in the day where staying up to watch the #sb50 doesn’t seem like such a great idea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brianmoore666 it was like watching the Seahawks from 2013.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iwan_ellis no worries. Was good to have you over!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tired. #SB50<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cpriceNFL don’t feed a troll.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@j_fychan @JordanGPrice you haven’t just watched CBS’s coverage, have you?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@j_fychan @JordanGPrice my point was simply that the media will make it all about Manning when it was all about the Denver defense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iwan_ellis you left your charger here. Jenna will drop it in tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@j_fychan @JordanGPrice #parttimers?? You think Denver won because of Manning? Really?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @Trevla there’s no point. Trev’s in full on troll mode.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla not bitter at all. Thoroughly deserved win that was all about your defense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The media will make this all about Manning. Nothing could be further from the truth. #SB50<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 #bbcsuperbowl coverage is much better than #skyNFL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drmarchant1 puts Brady’s performance against you guys Ito some perspective.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another one out of the woodwork… where you been all season??  https://t.co/UEBF7ZWXgF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drmarchant1 they deserve the win tonight. Outplayed Carolina.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drmarchant1 imagine how much you’d have won by with a decent QB!! #SB50<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 he must be in a different league to Neil Reynolds then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JordanGPrice me and @therealfootsie can help you there…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesvobrien the best one by a country mile.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla the other elements of the Broncos game has been first class.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla his passing his terrible. No zip.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SionWilliams yep awesome so far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@punditsfolly was a catch because the ball didn’t touch the floor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cookie_1286 yes. It’s all about the Panthers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@punditsfolly Seattle and Green Bay maybe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@punditsfolly they are the two best teams in the AFC so big rivals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SionWilliams I can relax watching this year but hoping the panthers pull it off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SionWilliams who you supporting?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@punditsfolly I’m not supporting the Broncos. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesvobrien I’m hoping they batter Denver.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesvobrien who you supporting?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#KeepPounding<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OJDBROWN I’m a @Patriots boy so it has to be the @Panthers tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OJDBROWN who you supporting?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JosephToplis have never liked him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JosephToplis can’t stand Peyton so rooting for the panthers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JosephToplis hope the panthers win but think Broncos will win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @Trevla I was going to do that and then I was on the late roster so thought there was no point in using annual leave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @Trevla I’m late duty manager<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pecan Pie.  #yum  #Superbowl50  #Superbowl  https://t.co/0MJ5IXFve6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis agreed. This is another that got away…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was a poor kick but I’m not sure who was offside then. #IREvWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesvobrien agreed. That was never deliberate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis agreed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @stebrett just rewound it. Was his shoulder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @stebrett he landed on his neck. Therefore it was dangerous. :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Next one has to be a penalty try, surely?! #IREvWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @stebrett which is a yellow. You take responsibility to put them down safely. Earls didn’t and dropped him on his neck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @stebrett clear yellow by the rules Tony. Clear yellow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stebrett @samwarburton_ wasn’t even a yellow for that one!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis haha. He should have had a yellow. Terrible tackle despite what @ShaneWilliams11 is saying on commentary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is that not a penalty?! #IRLvWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis we are poor. Priestland has started badly which never bodes well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@only1Hollett got to love a man who gives his prediction half way through the game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BartonBank that’s why he shouldn’t play international rugby.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh dear, Priestland. #IreVWal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gwladrugby the boss was garbage but an international outside half should catch that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaskillS it was. 15. Zebo. Different numbers to the rugby you watch up there…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaskillS fullback<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did Faletau just catch their winger? #IREvWAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis surprised we didn’t get a penalty for it. They buckled completely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis biggar is as good as anyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Adverts on @ITVRugby are already doing my nut in. Do we really need one between the anthems and kick off?! #IreVWal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis weather makes it more of a lottery. I’d be more confident if it was dry. That said, we should win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis we going to do this?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @Bigt8409 @therealfootsie @j_fychan that’s awesome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlbertBreer apart from he was on the wrong team…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Scotland are still the same old Scotland. Can’t wait for @AndyNic9′s analysis.  #SCOvENG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Same old Andy Nicol:  Scotland are unlucky.  As always Andy…  #SCOvENG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fearlessidzine it started when we sold Vose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UK_Patriots he’s a better option than Blount.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__davidlewis @ealinglevy @lewisroderick @DaveGobbett brilliant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y bonkers. Going to Normandy to see it all is on my bucket list.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watched #selma. What on earth must these people have felt when Obama made the Whitehouse?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y the episode in the forest is bonkers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y the best tv series bar none.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis it said 60 mins but it was here within 40. Was lush.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis I had Jerk chicken. Jenna had a Caribbean burger. Go on deliveroo app. Was here in 40 mins.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awesome takeout from @IrieShack. If you’re in Cardiff, check them out!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gowenmedia good choice!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got to love a 10 minute #commute home on a #Friday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @dev2y I meant goals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamskipotatoe @dev2y how many did you get the end Jam?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y never mind @jamskipotatoe. How many did I set up for you. @therealfootsie we missed you tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AW15_ Twitter in a nutshell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y you’re whites tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 that’s a lush shirt!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GriffinSpurs did you get my text mate? Yiu about tomorrow?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@georgatutkwengo @markbutler1978 @billycoch @r77ulr that’s a different argument. Most on here have been blaming the WST.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markbutler1978 @billycoch @r77ulr and that is the main issue. People blaming the WST when Mills said it was his decision.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@r77ulr keep up the good work. Those with a brain understand you’re doing it right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 no worries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y @wayne_1603 footy this week gents?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rjonesyo @MattyWebber88 and very few are from right angles!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikehughescq @paulmwrexham @Holden87 agree entirely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrexhamFCFans being part of a team isn’t just about having the most skill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drmarchant1 @dgmcnee sure you don't want to experience it again?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GuillemBalague @GaryLineker its incredibly disrespectful anyway. They could still do the quadruple!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie @JordanGPrice found this gig for you…  https://t.co/bXiRInJbPv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thatphillad @ohwhatagaz this is bang on:   https://t.co/8dFRuwxRbV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BethJesswoolley @springsteen sounds like a plan!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So @springsteen is touring Europe again... Mint!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Leejones2510lj @therealfootsie you’re going to have to do a lot better than that…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cardiffcouncil not in Roath it isn’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y whites mate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The_Goat9 no worries; we had 14 anyway!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @ohwhatagaz @_steviejd_ @thatphillad I don’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ohwhatagaz @CezDavis @_steviejd_ @thatphillad sounds like the Ceri I know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @ohwhatagaz @_steviejd_ @thatphillad didn’t you also support Cardiff?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @thatphillad no need to bite. It’s factually correct.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darktaff yep. They should have won.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thatphillad @CezDavis true story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darktaff that is true. Keeping well?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Darktaff have Stoke ever been to Wembley?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 he's a big United fan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattyWebber88 agreed. Total waste of a wage if he’s not going to play.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattyWebber88 yep. No fowler either tonight, he’s on his way out surely?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattyWebber88 why keep it?! It’s not like they’d just won our first game in 6.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 I have one space if you fancy it…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y footy this week?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Predicted this a long time ago... It was always going to end badly.  https://t.co/8jSDy8DwLh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Call the midwife - as traumatic as ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drmarchant1 @dgmcnee your defense plays like yesterday and you’ll have a chance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dgmcnee @drmarchant1 best team won. It means Marchant ain’t making Super Bowl night though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesvobrien toms just given 7 more<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesvobrien we’re doing a great job of losing this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 it was exactly the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @Trevla that decision worked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesvobrien I feel sick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevla @Bigt8409 no but Neil Reynolds is annoying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @Trevla mile high tips it in Broncos favour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jamesvobrien 8 mate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jcorrigangolf @stephenjones9 rip it up and never bring it back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WildFire_79 that’s terrible, and just around the corner from where we are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thatphillad @JordanGPrice it’s like watching Wigan all over again…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gridiron thank you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gridiron if we’ve got a subscription, is this included?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis no worries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@therealfootsie @CezDavis @maliharries filmed near my parents. Beautiful part of the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Catching up on #hinterland. As good as ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@r77ulr @Wrexham_AFC home 1, away 2. #PickTheShirt #WXMAFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y whites mate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drmarchant1 @dgmcnee agreed. If this was in foxboro it would be pats by at least 15.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drmarchant1 @dgmcnee its Tom Brady v the broncos defence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drmarchant1 you want to come over for Super Bowl?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 there is a space for you if you want it…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y footy mate?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @Trevla that’s just weird<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @Trevla that’s exactly what our game plan will be next week.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigt8409 @SkySportsNFL he hates the Pats!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best QB of all time @Gridiron   https://t.co/Y0ZJfYkYCz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 that was immense from Brady. Didn’t even pretend to run.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the @Patriots aren’t running the ball tonight. #KCvsNE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 same here.   Edelman will make a huge difference. He allows Brady to get the ball out quick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 if we play to our best we’ll win. Wouldn’t say confident tho. You? Diary is cleared. Not sure if I’ll stay up for it all tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OJDBROWN @JohnJavanPerry some of us made the cover!! 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Loved a bit of Snape. RIP Alan Rickman   https://t.co/Zq6LboKH7a<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CezDavis @Banjalero what happened in it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 if I were on the opposite side to me and @The_Goat9 id be nervous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wayne_1603 you’re in pal!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ealinglevy you don’t change. I like that you don’t relaunch every two years. 😃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y colours tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The_Goat9 colours mate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The_Goat9 you are in!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@The_Goat9 just waiting on one person...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cerys_Ruth that’s one more reason not to watch Eastenders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cerys_Ruth well if the Christmas decorations are up again it sounds like you have.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cerys_Ruth virtually all of 2016 by the sounds of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dev2y footy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 @jonny_marchant normally you’d go Green Bay but they’ve been so poor offensively.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 @jonny_marchant agreed. I wouldn’t want to play Seattle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ben_keen86 @jonny_marchant unbelievable ending.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jerrythornton1 24 should have nailed him.<|endoftext|>
