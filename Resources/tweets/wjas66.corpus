<|startoftext|>@smalltwngirl918 He's obviously not a genius, however,  he's definitely not dumb. Evil? Absolutely.

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump It must suck knowing that 80 million people think you're a narcissistic, serial lying, dictator want-to-be, Russian asset &amp; criminal of these United States. ... and pathetic. Lose gracefully please. It's embarrassing to watch.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>No you're wrong @LindseyGrahamSC  This thing isn't going to "work itself out". You phucked up. You tampered with our election. You broke the law. People will be investigated for their attempted coup. You're a traitor @LindseyGrahamSC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bradonk26 @AynRandPaulRyan I honestly don't recall that (his literally saying that he takes responsibility for not taking the virus seriously, you could be right, however, he did a lot of time denying his handling of the pandemic incorrectly.

<|startoftext|>@augustracehorse @JasonSm66375837 @Kaybmagic1 @AynRandPaulRyan To be fair, the polls failed to take into account the tampering of votes via Russian influence to benefit trump. We've corrected that this year by more of us voting. A. Lot. More.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RudyGiuliani @realDonaldTrump Rudy, baby. Beam yourself back to Dec 31, 2001 and try this shit again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have you ever been so sure that you've written a brilliant tweet, that you pat yourself on the back, while grinning ear to ear, in anticipation of the buzzing notifications of hundreds of likes...only to hear goddamn crickets? Yep...me too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kaybmagic1 @AynRandPaulRyan @Kaybmagic1   My comment on watching twice, was referring to the actual debate...I am in agreement with your second sentence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bradonk26 @AynRandPaulRyan Right. Jan 20th oil will officially disappear..lol..He was talking about oil subsidies. Who built the cages is old news. Has Trump used the cages in the last 4 yrs? Biden has no problem taking responsibility for mistakes. Trump, a narcissistic, is incapable of admitting mistakes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kaybmagic1 @AynRandPaulRyan Why, did the debate look different on Fox?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AynRandPaulRyan I've watched it twice. I still don't see how anyone could declare trump the winner. I'm still confused as to how people said he did good... maybe by not having tantrums?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What will late night comedy do w/out Trump?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy I was able to take a self administered covid test w/out consent of a dr. Registered online &amp; took test in a pharmacy drive-thru. Test was avail 4 days after registering &amp; results 3 days after swabbing. Neg. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Somebody remind trump that Joe Biden wasn't president for 8 yrs. I mean, what has Pence done other than mismanage the pandemic as head of the task force, compromise his own integrity, and embarrass his church &amp; family by his unwavering loyalty to an admitted "cat" grabber?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even though meant in jest, I've since deleted said tweet. For those who missed it, and without going into great detail, it involved trump, trump supporters, dark web, hitmen, and irony. Thank you. 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tweet Regret..Although  my last tweet was brilliantly funny, I'm a single dad raising 2 teens, by myself, for the last 10 years. I try to lead by example. My last tweet failed. I wouldn't want my children to read / write a tweet  like that... and I don't need the SS dropping in..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@K97690265 @ItsFilly @CNNPolitics Lol 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNNPolitics Trump is such the narcissistic, that if he says something, it's automatically true. He's had all these pathetic republicans telling him how great everything he does is. They bend the knee to this narcissistic serial lying criminal that's occupying our white House...for now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Maybe you should be this passionate about your family. Speaking of...You should follow your daughters lead. Shes smart &amp; she obviously isn't drinking the Kool-Aid. What's Trump got on you, anyway?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great Video - Great line: "You can tell your family and friends you voted for trump, even when you voted for Joe Biden, no one will ever know"...oh this IS happening, I know it for a fact...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donwinslow Great Video - Great line: "You can tell your family and friends you voted for trump, even when you voted for Joe Biden" ...trust me, this IS happening, I know it for a fact...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big prob with republicans? They worship a leader that has absolutely no plan for anything. Imagine sacrificing your family's dignity, and your own career, for Donald Trump. This pied piper has led them right over the edge. #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare @realDonaldTrump #DumpTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Favorite line after debate:  "The bill for trumpism is coming due" - Steve Schmidt @SteveSchmidtSES @realDonaldTrump #TrumpIsPathetic #TrumpLostTheDebate #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lost opportunity for Joe:   "I served with Abraham Lincoln, I knew Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln was a friend of mine. Mr President, you're no Abraham Lincoln". Lol.. #JoeWonTheDebate #TrumpIsPathetic #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"This guy's got a dog whistle as big as a fog horn". My favorite line from Joe last night &amp; it was executed with perfection. Trump looked defeated and desperate. @realDonaldTrump #JoeWonTheDebate #TrumpIsPathetic #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelRapaport @iamrapaport I've got a love/hate relationship w/ you, mainly because you go way, way over the top...I miss those Brent battles bro! Anyway, I literally gave you a standing ovation for this vid... epically cool. My guess:  you're on a "list" by now..lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aravosis Yep, I've seen similar to this with people doing stimulants, but I've seen exactly this with people close to me having manic episodes. Either way, his family or friends should step in... eventually, massive depression is just around the corner.@realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just checking to see if I tweeted anything unusual last night..was excited &amp; couldn't sleep after debate.. took a xanax... suddenly it's like 4hrs later &amp; phones still in my hand...feeling groovy... might have to do that again...

<|startoftext|>You got a dog whistle as big as a fog horn! LMAO<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@atrupar Speaking of fiction  https://t.co/XaUU86HEtD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chipfranklin Hopefully both. I do appreciate the fact that Joe Biden takes the high road - it's very presidential &amp; something that Trump  knows nothing about. That being said, I'd love to see Joe body slam Trump. #BidenHarris2020Landslide #DumpTrump #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AynRandPaulRyan OMG. You are 100% spot on. Thank you, Donald Trump, that's pure gold...for Joe Biden. Anyone want to see an infomercial for why you should elect Joe Biden? Watch this...lol @realDonaldTrump #TrumpCrimeFamily #DumpTrump #VoteBlueToEndThisNightmare #BidenHarris2020ToSaveAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chipfranklin Isn't it amazing how you can make these things without taking Donald Trumps words out of context? This is great! Love it!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@amandacarpenter Trump's rallies are actually helping the Biden campaign, immensely. They're an infomercial as to why you should elect Joe Biden. I love it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DryHumorDryBeef @amandacarpenter New silent majority, my friend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amandacarpenter YES. For shits and giggles I watched Pennsylvania. I didn't think he looked well at all...and his voice was off...and he  seemed starved for words...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Valthe_Pal The fact that this is even relevant right now, blows my mind. Never would have thought...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar Wtf is up with that? It may be me, but lately, his voice doesn't sound right. Something's up w/ him...he looks different too. No, I'm not suggesting body snatchers or anything 🥺.. Sheesh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's some classic Trump... remember, this guy's got the codes...damn<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden @jennycohn1 Really puts things into perspective. We have to vote this narcissistic, serial lying, dictator want-to-be, and Russian asset, currently occupying the White House, OUT.

<|startoftext|>@ChrisMegerian Yep..I wonder how many of those tweets, etc were ultimately generated by firms like cambridge analytical?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Meh...never heard of him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AynRandPaulRyan Hey Republicans..you see this clip? Don't forget to watch it in it's entirety. This is the man that you had the perfect opportunity to get rid of. You chose yourself over Country. How do you explain this to your families? How can you tell them Trump is a good president?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DrDenaGrayson @AynRandPaulRyan It's amazing, after all Joe Biden has been through, that he still wants to dedicate, quite possibly, the remainder of his life to saving this country and the people in it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews Wow, Breitbart? Didn't know they were still a thing...aren't they like that paid Russian propaganda network, OAN? So, on Jan 20, 2021 they can all report you've been indicted. Will you already have left the country by then? Where will the Trump Crime Family go? #TrumpCrimeFamily<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews Ratcliffe..Need I say more? Nobody is buying this BS from you. You are done &amp; you've brought the GOP down w/ you.

<|startoftext|>@therecount Trump would sacrifice every family member to protect himself. He's prob got his kids doing all the "shady" stuff. Hell, it's already happened with associates of his. Once you've served your purpose, Trump kicks you to the curb &amp; suddenly you're getting indicted. #DumpTrump2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thedarknutt @therealscapper @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Yes...yes it is. 😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Now that right there is funny...don't care who you are...it's funny...lol<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan Me too &amp; when she gave a speech someone had written for her at the RNC, I figured she was being held hostage. Then she free styled here...and lied.  She's no longer my Kourtney Kardashian...a very sad day indeed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@revrrlewis This is exactly what we teach our youth not to do. It's inexcusable, but it's the only tactic they have left. Trump's only "weapon" is also his "kryptonite" #DumpTrump2020 #BidenHarrisLandslide2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNNPolitics Of course he did. Problem is that these morons buying everything he's selling are Fox Snooze addicts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kollywood_net @msantiv7 @KamVTV You're rambling again, it's okay...Trumper trait. Oh, you'll delete your account as soon as the results are official &amp; Joe is president ..&amp; Trump is indicted. You know you will. I take great pleasure in knowing this. Although I do kind of feel sorry for you. Such an empty life...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoJoFromJerz @realDonaldTrump @60Minutes I agree, however, remember what you're dealing with. Many are incapable of any type of reasoning. If Trump says it.. it is so. It blows my mind..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BradLyons78 @kollywood_net @msantiv7 @KamVTV Source? ...other than Trump himself<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bennettkdavis @kollywood_net @palazzo214 @kaitlancollins I need to remind myself of this as well. Thank you for this. Can't say I'm proud of all my tweets. I get way too emotional at times and, well ...you know...lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@clawsons84 @palazzo214 @kaitlancollins It sounds harsh, but you're not wrong. The majority of Trump supporters by me, are just that. The fact that Trump cannot stand his own supporters (outside of  rallies) is pretty ironic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eutierrialife @palazzo214 @kaitlancollins Maybe I've looked the other way, maybe not..but I'll tell you this: I had no idea as to the level of division here.

<|startoftext|>@kollywood_net @msantiv7 @KamVTV Hillary did get roughly 3 million more votes than Trump. The people chose her...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ScottAdamsSays It probably would have worked out better for the White House recently, had they been on the science side...but what do I know? Honestly, I find it hard to believe it's 50/50, but maybe thats why you said "seems".<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AnthonyDeFeli13 @ArthurSchwartz Well, Anthony, because I was explicitly talking about the Fox News coverage of the pandemic &amp; how they've recklessly played it down. I don't necessarily disagree with you, after your first sentence, that is.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#TrumpTheSnake<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar I remember I used to laugh at this guy, poke fun at him &amp; call him a clown.  But now...I'm really starting to lose sleep at night. This insanity is getting way too real. I truly cannot believe the words coming out of his mouth. Pence not invoking the 25th can own this mess too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnthonyDeFeli13 @ArthurSchwartz You cannot even compare the two. I don't recall people dying over the Russian probe, just going to jail. People died from Fox News calling the pandemic a hoax...and still continue to play it down...as numbers continue to grow today. Russia wasn't a hoax. It's very real.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So you're got a new mouthpiece puppet &amp; lapdog...and when he wakes up, you'll kick him to the curb &amp; trash him. Does Sasse ring a bell?

<|startoftext|>@1foreverseeking @KatiePavlich Actually, I was aiming more for patronizing. Yesterday, via tweet, I told a guy he was a looker and called him "baby". I treat both sexes equally.

<|startoftext|>@scottbmichaels @realDailyWire Pedantry...Lets call a duck a duck.

<|startoftext|>@slaymyface135 @RTQ91 @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump @SteveScully Hey Slam... You didn't even know what TDS was until Richard taught you...lol ...Take a seat and keep quiet. There's more for you to learn...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RTQ91 @slaymyface135 @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump @SteveScully Actually, I answered your question, Richard. I ask that you respectfully answer mine...but you can't w/out looking like a dick (pun intended) ..so you won't answer. Instead, YOU will continue to change the subject. Silly points? Really? You can't be serious...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RTQ91 @slaymyface135 @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump @SteveScully Lol...sounds like the standard "Trump" answer when asked this. This IS the subject...your running away? I'll answer your question: No, I don't think literal Court Packing is acceptable. I don't know if Joe will do it, he hasn't answered. Question answered. Answer mine..oh right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1WILLWHITE @uhhuhyeahwtever @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump @SteveScully @JoeBiden In retrospect, it was unkind of me to speculate as to your lack of education. Fly with the crows... You've got twice as much as the base and should probably put it to use...but there I go again. My bad. Sincere apologies.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RTQ91 @slaymyface135 @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump @SteveScully You're entitled to your opinions. You honestly believe trump is good for our country.. not morally corrupt or mentally unstable &amp; doesn't abuse the power or personally profit financially off of the presidency?..or do you tolerate this due to your fear of Dems destroying the US?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RTQ91 @slaymyface135 @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump @SteveScully Several convos going on here. Technically, you jumped into the convo I was having w/ the slammyface dude. So everytime I respond to him, you see it as well. I actually appreciate the info you've provided &amp; based on such, I prob won't use the literal term "court packing" for this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RTQ91 @slaymyface135 @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump @SteveScully Yeah, I wasn't responding to you Richard. Calm down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slaymyface135 @RTQ91 @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump @SteveScully Honestly, I've no idea what the hell you're trying to say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RTQ91 @slaymyface135 @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump @SteveScully Pedantry...I should have said they are "packing the court". I'll reluctantly give you that with an asterisk. *It's the Repubs "own form" of "court packing" to achieve the same result...to have their own majority, 6-3. I mean, what's the reason they don't want the Dems to do it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RTQ91 @slaymyface135 @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump @SteveScully No. You're accusing Biden of the possibility he may do something in the future that the Repubs are doing now. Seriously? Let's talk instead as to why Trump shouldn't remain President &amp; I'll even  forget the fact he's court packing now, since you think Biden will do it as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@slaymyface135 @RTQ91 @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump @SteveScully It's a ridiculous argument. FYI, I'm registered as no party. Some of my beliefs run closer to Repubs than Dems. Trump is court packing now &amp; Repubs have held a majority in the court for almost 50 yrs. I'd give the Dems the court to get rid of the criminal Trump. It's def worth it<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RTQ91 @slaymyface135 @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump @SteveScully Trump is a dangerous presidency, just the last few days prove that.

<|startoftext|>@slaymyface135 @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump @SteveScully I'm not going to waste my time, or yours, by debating this...and I won't insult you by making claims that trump supporters, at this point, lack the mental capacity to yadda yadda yadda.

<|startoftext|>@slaymyface135 @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump @SteveScully Yeah, how stupid he doesn't want to let Covid Trump near him. Seriously? Didn't you watch the last debate.

<|startoftext|>@Iridescentropy @atcbackdoor @Christi86079681 @Valthe_Pal @MOODOX007 @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump Trump supporters see &amp; hear what they're told by their leader. Doesn't matter how obviously ridiculous it is. It used to be humorous..but now it truly concerns me. I don't get it. I can't help but believe that one day they'll snap out of it &amp; be like "WTF was I thinking"? Right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AfterHoursBC @Christi86079681 @Valthe_Pal @MOODOX007 @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump Your frankness is appreciated... and somewhat laughable, if this were fiction. Unfortunately, I believe you are 100% spot on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atcbackdoor @ScottJund @Christi86079681 @Valthe_Pal @MOODOX007 @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump I don't care what was...I care what is. And what IS right now, is a phucking trainwreck. Every time you think it won't get worse, it does. Today alone, is enough to justify throwing his ass out now. We can't. Why? Because our forefathers never predicted this level of corruption.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PastaCats21 @Christi86079681 @Valthe_Pal @MOODOX007 @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump Clearly not bipart &amp; you're avoiding my question.. why wouldn't you want me to mention Trump or the Repubs?

<|startoftext|>@Chicago1Ray @realDonaldTrump Case Closed? I was going to call you an idiot... which obviously means you're a trump supporter...but I'm above that. Never had any issues with the post office... It's America's crown jewel &amp; an incredibly large percentage of Americans give it favorable ratings..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ugobruni @JimCarrey Actually, most don't. Roughly 92% of African American voters support Biden in the last polls I saw (July)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepDougCollins @realDonaldTrump I take such pleasure in knowing that you'll be paying a hefty price for your loyalty to a traitor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JacksonRyder21 @EricTrump Lol... just when I think people cannot get any dumber...along comes you...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichelleKinney @ProjectLincoln I'm convinced Jared Kushner is a humanoid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mirandadevine Just another pretty faced Trump puppet mouthpiece<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SandieS9 @RepsForBiden @gtconway3d @ProjectLincoln Poor little fool. Not getting any attention at home? This too shall pass and you'll need a new hobby to absorb your obvious insecurities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @FoxNews Enjoy? I don't think so. Watching that lapdog choke on your Johnson every time your near him is getting old.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@interabanger @realMikeLindell @gregkellyusa @newsmax "...by the fist load" Um, is that suppose to be a lot...a fist load? Lol..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lrihendry Lol...missed the first nail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@usmchowe Thought I saw you at Lowe's in A'dam this morning. Wasn't sure (been12yrs), so I opted out of the potential embarrassment of saying hello and opted in for the potential embarrassment of shouting out to you on Twitter, lol... Regardless, If it's you, I hope you are well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @CNN @foxandfriends Aw, somebody's having a meltdown.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You're afraid. You look it &amp; you tweet like it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump what's wrong with you, mr. Trump? Your eyes look funny, your face is bright red, and you're slurring your words at today's "news conference". You're rambling on and on, making no sense at all. Something is up with you and your health...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@USPS Louis Dejoy is another @realDonaldTrump  lapdog/partisan puppet hired to do exactly what he's doing now, destroying the USPS to gain favor with Trump &amp; increase the millions of dollars he already has invested in the USPS competition. The blatant conflict of interest is amazing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @CNN May...2017 Outraged.   August 2020..I'm  really starting to appreciate past humor of Kathy Griffin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump How convenient that you say mail in voting is okay in Florida, a state that you need and that you think seniors will be voting for you. Jesus, I feel sorry for anyone that has to spend any amount of time around you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TONYxTWO @realDonaldTrump I'm amazed at how often trump and his clueless supporters bring up Obama &amp; Clinton. I don't get it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guntotingteabag @Sheryl_40 @TONYxTWO @realDonaldTrump So what? What's your point? Clinton is no longer president. Why don't you focus on the here and now &amp; quit deflecting...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@longhornandlace @jessicacoelho7 @TONYxTWO @realDonaldTrump Clinton? Who cares? What's Clinton got to do with Trump raping young girls?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's official...#NobodyLikesTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump your bitch Barr isn't doing so well today. Looking forward to your trial and conviction...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JHSchneiderman What is wrong? This tools mid life crisis &amp; reckless decision making is going to cost lives. How many...remains to be seen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JHSchneiderman You are a disgrace and should resign your elected position immediately. The fact that you issued a permit for this is one thing, but you performed at this with your band? What are you 12? You may very well be responsible for people that may die. Was it worth it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jasonrapert I wonder if the people that became infected because of you will beat it also? You influenced others to be reckless, just as Oprah influenced you to use the word "vitriolic" ...lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jasonrapert Congrats on your Darwin Award...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump You said we'd see your taxes. You lied to us. Now you've filed more motions to prevent it. Why? You're a narcissistic serial liar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FLSheriffs @GovRonDeSantis Commitment? Seriously? To Floridians? You been getting into the stash in the evidence room? DEFUND!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovRonDeSantis @FLSheriffs "We succeeded and people just don't want to recognize it," he blustered. Then, jabbing his finger at reporters, he scolded the press: "You've got a lot of people in your profession who waxed poetically for weeks and weeks about how Florida was going to be just like New York,"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Melbias @GovRonDeSantis @FLSheriffs Please get some professional help. I feel sorry for your family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rightmike5 @Truth_Truth_Now @GreggJarrett @realDonaldTrump Um, I think you forgot your meds...lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenTedCruz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GreggJarrett "Legal and political analyst for Fox News"...lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonvoight I used to love watching you, thinking you were such a great and talented man. Thanks for ruining that for me...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrustGod7733 @TheLeoTerrell @TheRevAl @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump @SenRonJohnson @POTUS @donaldtrumpjr Lol...so funny...40%. I love how Trump supporters throw out ridiculous numbers &amp; expect people to believe it. Then again, Trump trains them well. Lol..40%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AMErikaNGIRLLL @realDonaldTrump @stockmonstervip #fakeaccount nobody could be so ignorant...not possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thejtlewis @realDonaldTrump Now I get why you suck up to Trump. Carry on...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump This is why you're such an a-hole. There's absolutely no reason to mention the mayor's political affiliation, unless, of course,  you are using this particular moment &amp; situation to campaign for re-election. You're a one term impeached president &amp; laughingstock to the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@real_defender Amen. Now let's get rid of that narcissistic, delusional, serial lying, criminal racist once and for all. Vote BLUE!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaraLeaTrump The name "Trump" is losing its luster. In time you'll be "lara smith" so as to avoid the embarrassment of being associated with the narcissistic, delusional, serial lying, convicted, ex-president donny trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So is killing dolphins while fishing for tuna. Carry on...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@real_defender @realDonaldTrump Jesus..Obama has absolutely nothing to do with Trump golfing &amp; the circumstances surrounding it. It is what it is. Grow up, child. What's next, "I know you are but what am I?"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Who cares? Quit your crying...grow up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump  accomplices shall fall too, w/ November's loss. Shame on #drbirx didn't figure you as one that would prostitute your professional credentials to benefit our narcissistic, serial lying, delusional &amp; want to be dictator president. Your family must be so proud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shame on #drbirx - I didn't figure you as one that would prostitute your professional credentials to benefit our narcissistic, serial lying, delusional &amp; want to be dictator president. Your family must be so proud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamsungMobileUS Hey now! I'm wondering if I can use my unlocked Galaxy S10+( SM-G975UZBAXAA) that I purchased from Amazon, as a trade-in for the S20 on your website.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump "PSYCHOLOGICAL DEFLECTION" by a narcissistic serial liar.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TangledBritches @jerseymom473 @PressSec Good at what? Sitting on Donny's lap while he moves her mouth? Here to stay? No, she's definitely not here to stay...unless Biden gives her a job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PressSec And.... you're lying. No surprise there. You're just a pretty face that says exactly what's she's told, seemingly, word for word. You must be so proud. On the bright side, you'll fit in perfect at Fox News once Donny loses in Nov.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@knox8ball @Mjgirard2 @kushbreath416 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Funny thing is... how delusional Trump supporters are to actually believe that. Oh, wait, Putin probably loves him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @SenCoryGardner Narcissistic serial liar...<|endoftext|>
