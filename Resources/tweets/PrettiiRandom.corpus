<|startoftext|>@JamaicanScholar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pettyyyyyyy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamaicanScholar I’m honestly shook by this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamaicanScholar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m trying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Niceeeee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m so unsurprised like it’s honestly sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Disability finally coming through after not getting paid for a month, and I’m getting my back pay 😭 I learned if I’m EVER going to do something like this again, I gotta have some money saved for shit like this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I read part of it, I’ll read it completely later<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bruh 😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought Common and Tiffany Haddish was dating?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow 2001 I was so young 😭 I didn’t even know this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I stan Megan but I just feel like there’s something more that the public just don’t know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can’t tell me that Megan just up and signed a contract and her moms just said “okay” with NO knowledge of what’s in the contract. There has to be more details to the story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also at that time, Megan’s mother was still alive and her manager. Her mother was a rapper herself and had some knowledge of the industry. Like what exactly made them sign so easily?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So are we going to address the fact that Megan is currently 25 and she signed that contract in 2018. And she’s saying that she was 20 when it all happened?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>👀👀👀👀 why would she even sign this 😩 This whole situation is embarrassing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When white women want to make something about them so bad 🙄 the hair section has ALWAYS been yours. EVERYTHING has always been yours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They don’t even rush like this in Newark 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a person that designs jewelry, you wouldn’t believe some of this shit yo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Baby got a little curry in him and he won’t stop moving lol<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This shit is getting really tired<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This thread 🤦🏾‍♀️😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mfs in their 30s still trying to find themselves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why the hell people cant understand this? This is why I shut up most of the time. Like I’m not trying to argue nor do I have an attitude 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn Jayda really letting that ugly nigga play her like that?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>🔥🔥🔥🔥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is the real question<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Retweeting so I can do later<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not appreciated or acknowledged for the work I really do. I’m an accountant working in a white man dominated workplace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Word, low key<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man he would’ve been poppin too<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sometimes we want more for black men than black men want for themselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want a jelly donut 🥴<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdrianXpression I literally just said this last night! Why are you so worried about what’s in a 12 year old’s pants; that’s not even your child 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this real?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamaicanScholar Socially promoted? 🤨<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just took some screenshots cuz you know I love the mess 🤗😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are not trying to discriminate against white people in these groups but we just want our space sometimes. Do you realize that you are in every part of our culture? Just let us have our shit sometimes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every damn time a white person joins a black centered group on FB, at least every one I’ve been in, they cause a lot of trouble.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s a group for black women to show off their crafts, da fuck is a white woman doing here?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really can’t believe that we even having this conversation in the group<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like girl, leave married men alone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But the lady is punishing her own daughter, that ain’t even her fault smh like do she hear herself right now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🔥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s ridiculous honestly 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I only got the eating part done in my routine 🥴😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I swear to god, having a business on Instagram and the fact it HAS to be connected with Facebook is so fucking annoying. Like it’s messing with my money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sheesh 😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s not possible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know, I’m really not a fan of those extreme baby hairs. It’s just too much for me. Like I’ve seen people use their actual hair to make baby hairs. That’s not baby hairs 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sis looks GOODT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That looks like Masika on the left tho 👀<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>😭😭😭😭😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can just watch Tyler perform and turn it off honestly#Grammys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Billy Porter’s skin looked so chocolate with the makeup 😩 #Grammys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s a bit nice to see the Jonas brothers perform now and seeing them perform when we were all younger #Grammys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay but Alicia is just casually playing the piano and talking to us lol #Grammys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gwen looks cute  #Grammys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you Alicia #Grammys<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Now that I'm thinking, that Hermes bag with the nude painting that @Kaynewest gave Kim years ago was literally a work of art. I don't think niggas caught onto that one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From reading this, I learned that to be a top designer, you must make your own material and your own feel. It's what makes them separate from the rest and stand out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like Gucci but after reading up on LV, LV winning for me like never before. The process to make the material sounds ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In 2003, LV collaborated with a Japanese's top neo-pop artist and made that colorful LV pattern. That pattern is literally made out of 33 colors. Impressive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm smoking and reading up the background of fabrics used in luxury brands like Gucci and Louis Vuittion. Tom Ford used to work for Gucci and Marc Jacobs used to work for LV.<|endoftext|>
