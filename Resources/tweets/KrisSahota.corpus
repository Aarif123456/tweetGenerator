<|startoftext|>If you’ve never seen a 243lb packet of Wotsits explode, you may be about to get lucky 😄 #USElectionResults #TrumpIsLosing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ah good morning! #Biden has taken the lead in #Georgia 🤞🏼 #USElection2020 #FridayMotivation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think #Trumps strategy is to find a literal handful of human errors in 160,000,000 votes cast by 160,000,000 people and demand they are voided. I’m just not sure how reducing Biden’s 3,500,000 lead by 36 votes is going to swing it for him? #USElection<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CNN just described #Trump as ‘an obese turtle flailing around on his back who can’t get up again’ 🐢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump complaining about a lack of honesty 😂 #USElection<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So apparently a 200 year old Doris lost her ballot and some random dude tried to get into a secure voting room and they wouldn’t let him 😂 The corruption is real people #STOPTHECOUNT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh my god this is hilarious, it’s on #skynews #USElection2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Trump &amp; his carers are making an announcement at 4:30 (UK) if you fancy a laugh/witnessing the end of democracy... #USElections<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PhaelBolsonaro @realDonaldTrump He certainly will be going 😀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm waiting for #Trump to announce he's individually suing every American who didn't vote for him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now #Trump and his rancid enablers are suing to halt vote-counting in Pennsylvania. #USElection2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#agedlikemilk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alexabrown If he holds his leads in Michigan &amp; Nevada he wins. However, we still have Trump's recounts to go... Personally I have full faith in the fox overseeing the counting of the chickens so I'm sure it'll be fine.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Zen_of_Science Aww this makes me sad. We’re thinking of giving our black cat away to a couple we know as he has been  deeply unhappy since we got out new cat. He hates him and now just hisses at us in the 5 mins a day he spends at home<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A sad day for #BillBryson fans but, if he’s happy I’m happy, love this man! His unique perspective on trans-Atlantic life still cracks me up every time.  https://t.co/2Bjm4mjKhE<|endoftext|>
