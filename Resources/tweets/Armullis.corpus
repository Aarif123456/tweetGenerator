<|startoftext|>@kokholm_maja @AntonioSabatoJr No, Trump WON the votes of some 75 Million voters.....the most that any incumbent President has ever won! The loss doesn’t make statistical sense.

<|startoftext|>her gang of liars tried to impeach Trump......for nothing! We watch Trump win re-election and magically overnight Hundreds of thousands of ballots, all for Biden, show up in the middle of the night, coincidentally the GOP Poll Watchers were not allowed in the room to see them!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How rich it is....the left is telling us to accept the results and “work with them” for a better America! Trumps campaign was illegally spied on....and nobody went to jail. Trump was accused of “collusion with the Russians” which was totally bogus. Then, Nancy Pelosi and (part 1)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Most states completed the counts on election night! But, the pivotal swing states controlled by Democrats kept counting well after Election Day! Why? To hurt @realDonaldTrump ! Here in Florida, we were told to have our ballots in by 7pm Election Day. Don’t use US Mail.......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fraud!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Simply amazing how @realDonaldTrump was leading in a handful of states.....then the Democrats started whittling away at Trumps lead behind closed doors! Poll Watchers barred from seeing the count, which is a violation of Federal Law!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Election ended on November 3rd! Yet Democrat controlled vote counting continues. Most states finished their counting the evening of November 3rd, but counting continues ONLY in states crucial to @realDonaldTrump winning! Democrat Conspiracy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@margare67494849 Pelosi lost 6 seats in the House to the GOP, with another 4 yet to be decided. The Senate remains in Republican control. Two State legislatures went to GOP control, the GOP lost no Governor seats!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So what happened Democrats? Where was the “Blue Wave” we were told so much about? Texas did not go Blue! Florida and Ohio voted Trump! Trump leads the count in Michigan and Pennsylvania. Senate remains in GOP control. GOP gained seats in the House.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Cflmarth @familyunequal @realDonaldTrump By whom? Chicoms? What a laugh.....<|endoftext|>
