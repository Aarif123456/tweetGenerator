<|startoftext|>@Ibutterfly34 it depends on how many procent of your wage is cut off. For me it is 8.3% of my wage. Some may pay more or less but the insurances ahve also diffrenr services. For example aiding people wich go to the gym.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LordPhysicist The sad fact is in the world no one knows realy about the conflict. I mean the UN dosnt even take a side as Marocco blocks any negotiations and the UN sees Spain responsible but Spain has gave up all controll over it. And so no one in the UN talks of it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LordPhysicist Amd yes Algeria dig a huge sand wall threw the area Marocco dosnt controll.

<|startoftext|>@LordPhysicist just the diffrence no one recognize Marocco controll of Western Sahara.

<|startoftext|>@LordPhysicist In worse case Algeria could be pretty mad as Algeria is fighting for the rights of the Sahawi people as both Mauretania and Marocco invaded western Sahara after Spain leaved for defacto a lots of bird sh** or in other words phosphorus. You can compare the conflict with Israel-PA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LordPhysicist on the other hand there is no official responsible. The UN says Spain as former ruler until 1963, but Spain says Mauretania and Marocco.

<|startoftext|>Compared to the previous quarter, growth in trade, industry and hospitality sectors is seen as the key reason for the 6.9 percent increase in GDP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>However it is not expected that the increase in gross domestic product will last. In the final fourth quarter of 2020, economists expect the negative effect caused by coronavirus countermeasures in the second wave to show.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The government also outlawed the group's symbols, such as a two-grenade skull marked with the number 44. "The four stands for the letter D as the fourth letter in the alphabet in the Nazi code, the number 44 being an abbreviation for the so-called "Dirlewanger division.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In the early hours of Tuesday, the Interior Ministry said in a statement, swastikas were among the Nazi symbols found in searches of the homes of 11 members of the group in the states of Hesse, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and North Rhine-Westphalia.  https://t.co/3TRhq4YTKW<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>However, Belgium has been pulling back into lockdown in the weeks after - closing all but important firms, restricting contacts to a minimum and seemingly seeing a result. However a collective relaxation of such laws will go into effect as of today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This news comes in stark contrast to last month (27 October), when Belgium overtook the Czech Republic, with 1,391 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants, earning the worst infection rate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>According to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the 315 new confirmed cases in Belgium per 100,000 give it the ninth best rate of infection in Europe for the last two weeks.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>said Mayor Marcus K√∂nig at an online press conference. This will initially apply until December 20th.  The reason is the increase in the incidence value to more than 300 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in the past seven days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Germany #N√ºrnberg #Bayern #Coronavirus #RESTRICIONS  Bavaria's second largest city, Nuremberg, imposes an exit restriction. In the 518,000-inhabitant city, leaving the apartment is only allowed for a valid reason such as going to work,<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The Thuiner Franciscan Order also runs schools, a boarding school for boys and a vocational school.  At the end of last week, the health department ordered quarantine for the entire monastery grounds after several sisters tested positive for the corona virus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Germany #Thuine #Niedersachsen #Coronavirus #OUTBREAK  76 nuns tested positive for the corona virus in a women's monastery in Lower Saxony.  The tests were negative for 85 nuns, said the General Superior of the Thuiner Franciscan Order.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The funeral took place on Saturday in Kampong Chhnang Province in the center of the kingdom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More than 130 others had to be treated temporarily in hospital.  According to initial studies, the wine was probably mixed with highly toxic methanol. The police have closed nine places where the rice wine was produced and sold, it said.  Five suspects were arrested.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Cambodia #KampongChhnang #poisoning  At a funeral in Cambodia, the participants drank rice wine that was apparently adulterated.  By the beginning of the week, seven people had died of serious poisoning, reported the Phnom Penh Post newspaper.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tebboune is "on the way to recovery". The head of state was brought to a clinic in Germany for medical examinations at the end of October after suspicion of corona among several of his employees. A few days later, his office then announced that the president had become infected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Germany #Algeria #Berlin #Coronavirus  The Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, who was treated for a corona infection in Germany, wants to return to his homeland soon. The 75-year-old has left the hospital and will fly to Algeria "in the next few days," the presidency said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>According to an expert, the federal government is hoping for a very active participation of several million people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In Vienna, the capacity is designed for up to 150,000 people per day.  Corona infection is detected via an antigen test, which should be checked with a PCR test if the result is positive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tracking down those infected with corona, even symptom-free, is an important component in breaking chains of infection.  In the federal states of Tyrol, Vorarlberg and Vienna, the multi-day mass tests begin on Friday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Austria #Vienna #Coronavirus  Austria relies on voluntary mass tests of the population to contain the corona pandemic.  The community of Annaberg-Lung√∂tz in the Salzburger Land started the event.  The 2200 citizens are asked to be tested on Tuesday and Wednesday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Around 758,800 people are estimated to have survived the infection.  That is 19,800 more than the day before.  The numbers Saturday and Sunday are generally lower because some health authorities do not send numbers and these are added up in the next few days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This means that 1,067,473 people in Germany have been infected with Sars-CoV-2 since the beginning of the crisis.  16,636 people infected with the virus died - that is an increase of 388 cases compared to the previous day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Germany #RKI #Coronavirus #UPDATES  According to the figures from the Robert Koch Institute, there are around 292,000 active corona cases in Germany. The health authorities reported 13,604 new infections within 24 hours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He knows "in fact old people's homes that could not buy quick tests so far," he said on Tuesday in the ARD "Morgenmagazin".  A bigger problem, however, is the application: "The swabs have to be made by medical specialists, not everyone can do that themselves," said Laumann.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Germany #NRW #D√ºsseldorf #Coronavirus  The North Rhine-Westphalian Minister of Health Karl-Josef Laumann (CDU) has admitted bottlenecks in the supply of corona rapid tests.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Russia #Moscow #Coronavirus  According to the authorities, 569 people who tested positive for Corona died within 24 hours in Russia.  That is a record.  The number of deaths rose to 40,464. The number of positive tests increased by 26,402 to more than 2.32 million.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Germany #Unemployment #Coronavirus  The number of unemployed in Germany has fallen despite stricter corona rules.  According to the Federal Employment Agency, 2.699 million people were unemployed in November, 61,000 fewer than in October.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Recently, however, there has been speculation about a renewed partial lockdown during the Jewish festival of lights Hanukkah in mid-December.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In mid-September, the government imposed a second nationwide lockdown to prevent a collapse of the healthcare system.  The numbers fell from more than 9,000 new infections per day to several hundred.  In mid-October, the government began to implement gradual easing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the nine-million-inhabitant country, the number of infections had increased massively after a comparatively mild pandemic began in the summer.  The reason is, among other things, premature easing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More infections in one day were last reported on October 19, 1517.  Of the more than 56,000 tests carried out, 2.2 percent were positive, the rate of positive tests had recently risen slightly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Israel #Jerusalem #Coronavirus  The number of new infections with the coronavirus in Israel has climbed to its highest level since mid-October.  As the country's Ministry of Health announced on Tuesday, 1227 new cases were registered within 24 hours.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>On the one hand, large quantities of the coveted vaccines are interesting for criminals.  In addition, one must also expect protests or blockades by violent vaccination opponents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In addition, the Bundeswehr should help with the further distribution of the drugs to the vaccination centers planned nationwide, according to the information in the letter.  In security circles it is said that protected storage of the vaccination doses is important.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In a letter, State Secretary Thomas Steffen asked for official assistance with the safe temporary storage of vaccination doses in protected military barracks, as reported by "Spiegel".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Germany #Coronavirus  According to a report, the Federal Ministry of Health has asked the Bundeswehr for logistical help in preparing the corona vaccinations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Since data was recorded on April 30, 2020, 76 districts have been affected by capacity bottlenecks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As of November 27, almost every sixth health department is affected.  In most cases, the health authorities indicate a need for support with contact follow-up.  According to the RKI, the offices are supported by the responsible state authorities and in part by the Bundeswehr.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>After initial investigations, the police assume that the items from the Bundeswehr have been stored for at least 20 years.  "A large number of the objects gave the impression that they were ancient and heavily corroded," said the find.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In two basement rooms and a rented garage there were also around 170 kilograms of propellant powder and license-free weapons.  According to the police, the over 80-year-old tenant was previously employed by the Bundeswehr site administration.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The reason for criticism is an appearance by Kramp-Karrenbauer in the Bundestag last Wednesday.  There she said that negotiations with Russia should be negotiated from a "position of strength". "That, too, has always been a good tradition of German foreign policy,<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>said the new food minister Rasmus Prehn. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen announced on November 4th that all around 17 million minks in Denmark should be killed because the coronavirus had mutated in the animals and had been transmitted to humans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The Danish government is now taking a closer look at this possibility: Together with the other parliamentary parties and the responsible authorities, they want to analyze whether it is the right approach to dig up the mink and then burn it,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Several parties in the parliament in Copenhagen fear that the culled fur animals could secrete phosphorus and nitrogen during the decomposition process and thus contaminate drinking water or bathing water. That is why a political majority is in favor of digging up the animals.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hungary and maybe Poland are about to Veto the 750 billion and 1.1 trillion aid to battle the damege caused by the coronavirus. Some states are deeply depending on this aid. Reasone is another decision by the EU to punish Hungary...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@threadreaderapp please unroll<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>according to a video conference between EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen with Merkel and Parliament President David Sassoli.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the European Parliament are urging that the financial package be passed quickly.  Time is running out because the budget and the Corona crisis aid should come into effect on January 1st,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In this case, EU countries such as the Netherlands or the European Parliament are likely to block the financial package in protest. At the same time, Chancellor Angela Merkel and the heads of the EU Commission and<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How the conflict with Hungary could be resolved is currently completely unclear.  It is conceivable that the heads of state and government will have to deal with the issue at a summit.  It is almost impossible that the conditionality mechanism will be abandoned after all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>a Hungarian veto would be enough to stop implementation. In contrast, only a qualified majority is required to adopt the condicenaltiy regulation. This has already been achieved when 15 EU states agree, which together make up at least 65 percent of the population of the Union.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>According to information, the permanent representative of the country only let it be known on Wednesday evening that an examination was still ongoing.  Because unanimous resolutions are necessary for the core elements of the financial package,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The criticism is categorically rejected from Warsaw and Budapest. It is still unclear whether Poland will also refuse to approve the financial package because of the planned instrument.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The governments in Hungary and Poland in particular have been repeatedly accused of expanding their influence on the judiciary.  All attempts to persuade them to change course by political means have so far been unsuccessful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Specifically, this could be the case, for example, if the lack of independence of the courts in a recipient country enables or even clearly encourages the abuse of EU funds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The conditionality regulation criticized by Hungary is intended to make it possible to cut EU funds on a large scale if the rule of law in a member state is at risk and the misuse of EU funds is threatened or already taking place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The negotiators of the member states and the European Parliament had been negotiating the budget since September.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the planned European Corona aid of up to 750 billion euros could not be launched as planned.  This in turn could have serious economic consequences for countries like Italy.  The planned EU budget provides for a volume of just under 1.1 trillion euros for the years 2021 to 2027.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The reason is apparently that a new instrument to punish violations of the rule of law violates the agreements made by the heads of state and government in July. Should Hungary actually exercise its veto,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As already announced, Hungary actually seems to want to block the budget decision: According to information, the country announced at a meeting of the permanent representatives of the member states that it would not be able to approve the billion dollar financial package.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>From around 1938 another motive shaped his aversion.  Elser recognized the preparations for war and the yielding of the Western powers with regard to territorial demands of the German Reich. He denied 1933 Hitlee even the greeting. He got killed April 9th 1945 in Dachau.<|endoftext|>
