<|startoftext|>@Diffy10 @jimdunaway @Bamadad1985 @JOXRoundtable @finebaum Chris Peterson??!! WOW!! Dabo is successful and has work ethic, the guy has busted his ass his whole life to get where he's at. It's a no-brainer. Everybody can't be a superstar on the field like @Bamadad1985. Chris Peterson...  C'mon man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Diffy10 @Bamadad1985 @RealPaulPedram Somebody has to step up and help Sexton, he can't win this game by himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bamadad1985 @Diffy10 @RealPaulPedram I never said you criticized the coach, I said you criticized from the couch. I don't know alot about basketball, but somebody has to step up because we are lacking in playmakers and leadership.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Diffy10 @Bamadad1985 @RealPaulPedram How you gonna criticize from your couch? CoachAJ knows more than all of us and if Sexton is good enough for him then he's good enough for me.<|endoftext|>
