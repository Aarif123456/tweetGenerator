<|startoftext|>@jaksroche24 @JoeMyGod @marklevinshow Actually that would be you stupid Republicans talking about Obama.

<|startoftext|>@swimjammer Woof!  🤓😈<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sisteramnesia64 The “reporter” who asked this left Fox News, after many years, when sexual misconduct allegations were pointed towards him.  Now he works for a low-life right wing, conservative media site.  So I’m not surprised at all that he asked this question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshuaOwen Nope.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@iamknitguy I found another recipe online, that was the exact same recipe that I just used, but called for 2 tbsp of hot water. So I added the 2 tbsp of hot water, and work the dough with the spatula and it seems to have done the trick. This batch baked  out nice and flat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FifthThird Yeah.  Refunding my $125 of fees that I incurred from my apartment complex due to money that you held and didn’t tell me about would be nice.  Treat your customers better!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@iamknitguy Yep.  I was really careful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iamknitguy I found a recipe exactly the same, but they add 2 tablespoons of hot water. I tried baking.  It was a mess.  I’m chilling the dough now, seeing is that helps.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Okay bakers, I followed the chocolate chip cookie recipe to a T.  But the cookie dough is really crumbly.  That shouldn’t be.  It’s almost like it’s too dry.  It asked for 1 stick of butter.  Would adding a little more (maybe like a tbsp or 2) help make it less dry and crumbly?<|endoftext|>
