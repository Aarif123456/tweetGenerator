<|startoftext|>They don't even try to be congenial.  This is like the "National Inquirer" of news sources.

<|startoftext|>It lies on both sides, but man...@FoxNews and @TuckerCarlson are over the top. This is crazy. Fear mongering at it's finest. Truly upsetting to know people are watching this and taking it as fact. #propagandalive #FoxNews #fauxnews #ridiculous<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Holy shit.  Trump is taking notes right now because this is what it sounds like when you have a plan.  #PresidentialDebate2020 #Debates2020 #DebateTonight #debate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All he's doing right now is shining a light on the fact that he still has no plan...  #PresidentialDebate2020 #Debates2020 #DebateTonight #debate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Bitch...talk about my family one more time...  #PresidentialDebate2020 #Debates2020 #DebateTonight #debate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What in the Blue Hell is he on about?    #PresidentialDebate2020 #Debates2020 #DebateTonight #debate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is that a thing?  We can prepay our taxes?  #PresidentialDebate2020 #Debate2020 #debate #Debate2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@takenner @MSNBC Great question.  Normally, nothing.  This post was really more of a "what are your thoughts" kind of post.  I worded it poorly.  That said, I think it's the manner in which it went down, the circumstances/timing seemed inappropriate.I would feel that way regardless of who it was.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My only question really is, where has this decisiveness been during the pandemic?   #Trump #imdonenow<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Additionally @FrontierCare, that's the front of the plane I'm on.  The back half of the plane is full.  I'm just a dude who tells jokes, but it doesn't make sense that it had to stay this way because we needed to maintain "weight distribution".  #QuestionOfTheDay #FridayThoughts  https://t.co/XIf4YEfuHJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrontierCare does this mean they won't bring the drink this way?  You know, because we'll go nose up, tail down?  If I'm thirsty and want to pay $10 for a coke, will they throw it at me from the front half?  #QuestionOfTheDay #FridayThoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just curious @FrontierCare as to why, if there are six people in a row, only four masks drop in an emergency situation?  What kind of Hunger Games mess is that?   #QuestionOfTheDay #FridayThoughts<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What fresh hell is this?!!  If Finn drops the belt here, I swear I'm done watching.  #WWE #RAW #RAWAfterMania<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#WWE just did Dean so dirty ya'll.  Hope he ends up in @AEWrestling .  That was f*&amp;d up.   #RAWAfterMania #RAW #RAWTonight #DeanAmbrose<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interrupting this week's abuse of Dean Ambrose because he wants to do something different with himself, because #WWE doesn't have a clue of what to do with him, to plug this show on the 27th in the Greensboro. #NCComedyFest #RAW  #RAWAfterMania #comedy   https://t.co/nOUo2rb8Uk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>sI'm gonna interrupt this week's overexposure of Aleister Black and Riccochet, to share this with you.  If you're going to be in the Durham, NC area, come out.  #RAW #comedy #standup #standupcomedy #RAWAfterMania #WWE #RAW  https://t.co/gNhgwCYM6D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So let me see if I understand this right...I've watched Lacey Evans do those pointless catwalk interruptions for months, and this was the payoff?  I get it, a feud is coming, but, really? Down.   #down #WWE #RAWAfterMania #RAW #RAWTonight #Wrestlemania35<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GiseleM52 Right?!  Did you watch Mania?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just watched WWE Photo Shoot with @AJStylesOrg.  Even bigger fan now.  Dude is awesome. #AJStyles #WWE #fan #thankyou<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok.  Controversial ending.  Does #RondaRousey really walk away like that?  Is the open door for a later return?  Thoughts?   #RondaVsCharlotteVsBecky #WrestleMania #Wrestlemania35 #WWE #WinnerTakeAll #shoulderswerenotpinned<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The craziest thing about this is that is was only a few years ago when they stopped letting @BeckyLynchWWE cut promos as the champ.  Look at her now.  I've been a fan since I first saw her in the ring, so excited for this main event. #WrestleMania #TheMan #Wrestlemania35 #WWE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When we it comes to Carmella, I'd watch a 7hr dance break.    #JustSayin #WrestleMania #Wrestlemania35 #Carmella #WWE #dancebreak<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GosheyMr thanks for retweeting! #WrestleMania<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why TF can't I see people's replies?  I'm not getting 95% of my notifications on here.  Sorry if I don't respond.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it bad that I could not care less about Angle's last match?  I want to watch this just to see if it is actually Corbin.  If it is, boo.  But also, this shell of a person is not my #KurtAngle #Wrestlemania35 #WrestleMania #WWE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not saying this match has been bad, but I would like to note that the pace of this match really hasn't changed regardless of the "damage" inflicted.  #WrestleMania #Wrestlemania35 #WresteMania #WresteMania35<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm retweeting myself here, because I'm dumb, and completely put the wrong person.  What I meant to do was tag @SimonMiller316 , Ups And Downs is awesome, my bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This match would've way more exciting 14 years ago.  I can't tell if they're moving this slow because it's just their pace, or if they just simply can't move any faster at this point in their lives.   #WresteMania35 #WresteMania #Wrestlemania35 #WrestleMania #WWE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I bet the dude who drove Triple H down the ramp was pissed about getting spit on.  That wasn't even a little, that was excessive.  My man needed an umbrella for that job. #WrestleMania #Wrestlemania35 #TripleH #WresteMania #WresteMania35 #WWE<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MrumaDrive Ifb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thought about during cardio and, yeah, that last tweet may be misleading. If you read it, you may have been like, "what happens in his mind when he meets @MsCharlotteWWE and @BeckyLynchWWE?"  Good question.  The same thing that happens in reality.  Nothing. #SDLive #SmackDownLIVE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bout to get my fitness on.  You know, in case I run into @MsCharlotteWWE or @BeckyLynchWWE tonight at #SDLive. Not that it would matter because, I'd probably just pass out or do that thing where I speak, but just sound totally wasted. But in my head... #motivation #SmackDownLIVE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh snap!  Twilight Zone!  #Syfy #TwighlightZone<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, it's over.  All I can say is...god damn cinematic masterpiece.  #Robocroc #Syfy #bmoviemaniacs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dude really?  You watched your boyfriend get ate like 3 hrs earlier, and now you have a date with another guy?  #bmoviebinge #Syfy #Robocroc<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Dude...you never bring a knife to a #Robocroc fight.  #Syfy #Wordstoliveby #bmoviebinge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rule #1, never stop running when being chased by a mechanical #Robocroc.  Duh.  #bmoviebinge #syfy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously @SYFY hit me up.  I can scream better than this.  Just sayin'.  My Irish accent is waaay better.  #Robocroc #Syfy #Bmoviebinge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheHenleyBrand Thanks!  I did.  Hope you did too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This lady controlling it looks just like Hilary Clinton.  #Robocroc #Syfy #badmoviebinge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheHenleyBrand Perfectly said...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy shit it can fly.  #Robocroc #helicopterdown #badmoviebinge #Syfy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All these people died, yet none of the wounds indicate croc bites or attack.  #awfulpoolday #syfy #MondayMotivation #Robocroc<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Say what you will about Mickie's gear, it's bad, but the anorexic Asuska knockoff ROH champ is way worse.  Crop top and shorts with confetti taped on.  Picking up Emma was the best move they could have made #ROH #wwe #mickiejames #RAW #ringofhonor #nosell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Anybody remember the last time Mickie James didn't lose?  #RAW #RAWRichmond #gauntletmatch #MITB2018<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Took me longer to type that tweet than it did for Dana Brooke to get beat.  #wwe #RAW #RAWRichmond #gauntletmatch #MITB #MITB2018<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And Dana Brooke gets eliminated in the next 25 seconds.  #GuantletMatch #RAW #RAWRichmond #wwe<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ReeTre2 Yeah.  I thought she was supposed to be working a program with Mickie James too.  If she wins the title, I may stop watching for a while.  For me, the women's division is the best thing going.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll be there next week ya'll!  #pumped #SDLive #Smackdown #SmackDownLive #MITB #Raleigh #WWELive<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>At an open mic right now.  There's a blind comic on stage, they're lighting him, and he can't see it.

<|startoftext|>@Bounty Thanks!  It's all about the fish.  While you're passing things up, if they want, I'm available to hold the disclaimer sign, or do a voiceover.  I'd be more than happy to do that for you.  And the fish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rod_bridgers I agree.  Tonight, I'm giving it to Pep though.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@vafredy85 thanks for retweeting!  #appreciated #BBMAs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would feel much better about this @Bounty commercial where the little boy slams the fish into the side of the tank is there were a disclaimer that said, "No fish were hurt during the filming of this commercial." #justsayin #BBMAs #BillboardMusicAwards #BillboardMusicAwards2018<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BTS may be the most metro sexual boy band ever....ever......like in the history of boy bands....like, they're a step away from becoming an Asian version of Culture Club....with dance moves. #BBMAs #BillboardMusicAwards #BillboardMusicAwards2018 #Billboards2018<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Arianna_Molina8 thanks for retweeting!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've seen this commercial so many times, I feel like I know this woman way more than I should.  @23andMe , if you're going to have this many commercial spots, maybe you should have more than one commercial. Added bonus, that song is stuck in my head now. #BBMAs #Billboards2018<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yeah...I'm just going to wait for the elimination chamber match. Otherwise, I'm going to fall asleep.  #stilldontcare #WWEChamber #WWE #EliminationChamber2018 #EliminationChamber<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Is it just me, or does Titus look like he'd be a douche in real life?  #WWEChamber #WWE #TitusWorldWide #EliminationChamber #EliminationChamber2018<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I mean, can they really find nothing else to do with Dana?  Why not just send her to Smackdown?  Far more entertaining than Tamina.  #EliminationChamber2018 #SDLive #WWEChamber #WWE #EliminationChamber<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More than the match, it would be nice if I gave a shit about Titus, Apollo, or Dana Brooke. #EliminationChamber2018 #WWE #WWEChamber #EliminationChamber<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't know what he just said, but it sounded dirty. #WWEChamber #WWE #EliminationChamber2018 #EliminationChamber<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ncgrit Gotta teach him to at least offer some kibble first.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ncgrit As long as he's happy, all I care about.  And maybe, not trying to "Pepe Le Pew" every dog he sees.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ncgrit My neighbor let him close to her dogs and he went from barking to trying to get it in.  Like a drunk guy at last call.  Shockingly, disturbingly, aggressive...mainly only focused on the male dog, even humped the air a little...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I figured it out.  My dog isn't agressive, he's horny AF.  And apparently, a little bi.  #dogsoftwitter #pentup #dog #randy #whatdoido #nisdedchat #hmm #interesting<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ncgrit I've moved to the bathroom.  Typing slowly and quietly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ncgrit They can't see me.  I'm behind the couch.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>"I'll watch him and his friends.  I can totally handle 4 9yr olds." I said this, and I'm dumb.  #shootmenow #OMG #famouslastwords #parenting #adulting #theyneverstop<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Dying down in here...plus I'm hungry.  Deuces. #HOA #HOAmeeting #adulting #foodtime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's literally a 102-4 melee in here.  I do not envy the board. The native are restless AF. #HOA #HOAmeeting #adulting #homeowner<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And here goes Jan again.... #HOAmeeting #HOA #homeowner #adulting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This guy sounds like Quentin Lance. He just got a standing ovation for verbally whoopin ass. #Arrow #QuentinLance #HOA #adulting #HOAmeeting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently Larry is involved. He watches the neighborhood and report anything he finds suspect. So he's a snitch. #HOAmeeting #adulting #HOA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amidst the crazy, Larry got an award. It was promptly followed by a guy in the 3rd row asking who the hell Larry is. #HOA #adulting #meeting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jan is pissing them off ya'll.  #HOA #HOAmeeting #homeowner #adulting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Spewing incorrect info and getting the crowd riled up.  Good ol' Jan. #HOA #HOAmeeting #adulting #homeowner<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jan's been really quiet....I'm worried about her now.  Wait, there she goes. Geeez. #HOA #HOAmeeting #adulting #homeowner<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was feeling good about my new neighborhood....until tonight....time to move.  #HOA HOAmeeting #homeowner #adulting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These people are wild ya'll.  And the HOA lady is not havinv it.  #coldblooded #HOA #HOAmeeting  #homeowner #adulting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ooooh bitch.  Told you.  Better take that $4 out of the budget.  #HOA #math #homeowner #HOAmeeting #adulting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can't ask questions because we don't want to hear them Jan.  Damn. #HOA #HOAmeeting #homeowner #adulting #tension<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The President just said, if any volunteers are here, stand up. Then followed by saying he didn't recognize them.  #awful #HOAmeeting #grown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the worst volunteer recognition ever.... #HOA #homeowner #meeting #adulting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dude, Jan will not shut up.  #HOA #meeting #homeowner #adulting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They're doing a committee status report. Basically, they didn't do shit.  Jan is still talking out. #HOA  #homeowner #adulting #dammitjan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She said HOLD YOUR QUESTIONS JAN!!! Still tense ya'll. #HOA #meeting #homeowner #adulting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We just got hit with a "hold your questions please". My feet hurt. #HOA #homeowner #meeting #adulting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Uh-oh...error in the budget...gettin' tense ya'll.  #HOA #homeowner #adulting #bouttopopoff<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hey @PatMag7 , thank you for the retweet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Again, I'm sorry.  Is it the Botox?  Or is that a look of straight contempt on Melania's face?  #Jointsession #JointAddress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@funnypost01 Thank you for following me!  I shall follow back!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, I was wrong.  Not one mention of the election or "fake news".  #MyBad #Jointsession #JointAddress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mike Pence and Paul Ryan's quads are gonna be sore tomorrow.  Jacked, but sore.  #squats #feeltheburn #Jointsession #JointAddress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But wouldn't helping the veterans also mean undoing your hiring freeze at the VA?  The short-staffed VA?  #JointAddress #Jointsession<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charnotxes thank you for retweeting!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tattooadd Thanks for following along!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And his neck vag.  It's trippy man.  #NeckVagina #Jointsession #JointAddress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please understand.  He bugs me. Not just his politics, which I don't disagree with everything, him as a person.  #Jointsession #JointAddress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I may have offended some people.  #Jointsession #JointAddress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agreed.  #Jointsession #FDA #JointAddress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sorry ya'll, but she looks like she could give a shit less.  #Jointsession #JointAddress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG Paul Ryan!  You don't need to stand after everything he says.  #kissass #Jointsession #JointAddress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay Dolph.  That was just messed up.  #Nutshot #SDLive #SmackDownLIVE #Smackdown #WWE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He also said, "A house divided against itself can not stand." You don't heed that. #Trump #Jointsession #JointAddress #presidentialaddress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sorry.  Why does that get an ovation?  You have a motorcycle you won't ride on your  lawn.  Kudos?  #Jointsession #presidentialaddress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With their outfits, Trump, Pence, and Ryan look like a boy band. Is the name N'Suck taken?  #Jointsession #JointAddress #presidentialaddress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is Mattis high?  Or does he not know where he is right now because he's super old?  #Jointsession #Jointaddress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow.  We know where the racists in the room are now.  #Jointsession #JointAddress #thewallisdumb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want to touch it.  Not with my hand, but like a stick or something.  #neckvagina #Jointsession #JointAddress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Once you see his neck vagina, you can't not see it.  I mean, it moves.  #Jointsession #JointAddress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump  You can't clap for yourself.  That's worse than when you pretended to be your own PR person.  #Jointsession #JointAddress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How????  I get it man.  You said the same shit at CPAC too.  How??? #Jointsession #JointAddress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha!😀  https://t.co/P2Di6aYKQv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just noticed how he has a neck vagina.  #Jointsession #JointAddress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You think Mike and Paul coordinated their tie game? #twinsies #Jointsession #JointAddress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only good thing for me, about Trump, is getting to see Melania.  Stunning.  #Jointsession #JointAddress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WTF was that!!!!  LUKE M'FUKIN HARPER BABY!!! #wwe #SDLive #SmackDownLIVE #Smackdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please.  An "hour" of action?  Melania's lucky to see 6 minutes. #trumpaddress #Jointsession #JointAddress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dammit @millerhighlife, with your catchy jingle.  #stuckinmyhead #wevegotthebeer #loveit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Smackdown is som much better than Raw it's ridiculous.  #WWE #SDLive #SmackDownLIVE #Smackdown #RAWkindasucks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, be prepared to hear the words "Great", "Fantastic", and  "Best" a lot. #trumpaddress #Trump #congressionaladdress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bullet Points for Trump's speech tonight: 1) Election 2) Election 3) Fake News 4) Election  5) Random BS about his awesomeness #trumpaddress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like I'll be back and forth between Smackdown and Trump's speaking of meaningless words.  #SmackDownLIVE #WWE #trumpaddress #SDLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>His promo work is really good.  https://t.co/JRr8uIe0WD<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That's it for me here at @Raleighwood  tonight.  We will be coasting through the awards from here. Thank you Jean Best for the fun. #Oscars<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Michael J. Fox.  So inspirational to me. #Oscars #Oscars2017 #youwontseethisbutthankyou<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rogue One is like the "Titanic" of Star Wars films.  #Oscars #Oscars2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the best thing ever!  #KimmelRules #Oscars #Oscars2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He sounds like the dude from "Paradise Island". #Oscars #Oscars2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What?! The movie about the genocide of shellfish by a baby bird?! #Piper #Oscars2017 #Oscars<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shout out to the people who joined me on Live just now.  I screwed up. #Oscars #Oscars2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You go Jackie!  #RushHourForever #Oscars #Oscars2017 #InspectorLee<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Props to you, girl who's name I can't say.  Took that blow to the head in stride.  #Oscars #Oscars2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He just put the 2016 XXL freshmen class to shame.  #Oscars #Oscars2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did he just thank Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown? Seems a bit silly. Sure they'd rather be alive than inspiring you to make a film. #Oscars<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I didn't see "Moonlight", but I loved him in "Luke Cage". #Oscars2017 #Oscars #LukeCage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>JT!  #Oscars #Oscars2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need cool rhyming one-liners like Denzel.  #Oscars #Oscars2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love Lara Spencer man. #Oscars #Oscars2017<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>These two..... #Oscars #Oscars2017 #Raleighwood #AcademyAwards  https://t.co/zts0XnkAZJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had to fix my tie.  Watch out now!  #Oacars2017 #Oscars #Raleighwood  https://t.co/GBp0YKloUQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Words can not express the overwhelming feeling of stupidity..... #IMetRayAllen #NoClue #WhyGod #ISuck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That moment when the player you idolized as a kid walks away after a 5min conversation, and you just then realized that's who you talked to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got some SC dates coming up in March!  Check the site sometime this weekend to see when/where!   https://t.co/Xpsfl6wddt #blessed #workflow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump's speech writer has it made.  They've been on vacation since he took office.  #talkaboutnewshit #wegetityouwon #CPAC2017 #CPAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm actually embarassed at how just seeing that man takes me to such a negative place.  I need to check myself. #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God? Pssssh. We got Trump, we don't need no stinking God.  #CPAC2017 #CPAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry.  Again, forgive the ignorance.  Don't we all bleed the same color? #CPAC2017 #CPAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which will soon be replaced by an allegiance to Trump.  #CPAC2017 #CPAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thay's ironic, because you keep pissing some of them off. #CPAC #CPAC2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course it was because of you. Isn't it always? #CPAC2017 #CPAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Obviously not.  You're still here.  #CPAC2017 #CPAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mermaidgrassi thanks for retweeting!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"And that's the way we're gonna do it. Cam Brady 2012." #CPAC2017 #CPAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok. He's clapping for his own bullshit.  #CPAC2017 #CPAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't like my local movie theater because it's run down in my opinion. Thwy switched to a Coke freestyle machine. Damn terrorists. #CPAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>His impersonations are amazing.  #CPAC2017 #CPAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Enlighten us.  What's happening over there? #CPAC #CPAC2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And how do you propose to stop that?  Is a dome next? #CPAC2017 #CPAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No you didn't.  #CPAC2017 #CPAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's not a word!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You forgot "Special Teams".  #moron #CPAC2017 #CPAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They were already doing that.  #CPAC2017 #CPAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pre-president isn't a thing!  #CPAC2017 #CPAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This reminds me of the Pinky and The Brain episode where Brain just kept saying "repugnant".  #CPAC2017 #CPAC2017 #wakeup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah.  Native Americans who live there.  What assholes they are for protesting.  #dumbass #CPAC #CPAC2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This just sounds like more campaign promises.  #CPAC #CPAC2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course it's "great".With all of that money that he may or may not have (no tax return), he should buy a book of synonyms. #CPAC #CPAC2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow.  That felt hate-filled, not patriotic. #CPAC2017 #CPAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The more he speaks, the more weary and outright scared I become.  #CPAC2017 #CPAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's the election again......shocker.....#CPAC #CPAC2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excuse my ignorance. How can we stand by and let things like a wall happen? How can people cheer for this garbage?  #CPAC2017 #CPAC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the fuck man?  Back on the election.  #CPAC2017 #CPAC #ridiculousness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What was the point of this speech?  He just talked about himself and how "persecuted" he is.  Why are they cheering?  #CPAC #CPAC2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sorry.  What was the point of this speech? Why is he still on about the election? #CPAC2017 #CPAC2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the polls are wrong? #CPAC #CPAC2017 #Narcissist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does that make me a source? #CPAC #CPAC2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay.  You're a horrible human being.  That what you wanted?  #DonaldTrump #CPAC #CPAC2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Of course Donald.  Of course you know all of the media's sources. #CPAC2017 #CPAC #idiot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Karaoke time!  What to sing?  #MrJones #CountingCrows #HollywoodBeach<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's lit down here.  That is all.  #HollywoodBeach #Miami #letsdothis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good night ya'll, hope tomorrow is awesome for you.  #ownit #gratitude<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy crap I can NOT wait for March 3rd, so I can check out Logan.  #Logan #xmen #Marvel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've been studying people's Instagram stories and now I'm ready to do one.  Tune in this weekend to watch me eat a cheeseburger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Couple more dates going up on the site soon, but for now, I am hosting the Oscars at Raleighwood Cinema Grill this Sunday!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, thanks @inwardflame for the like!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big THANK YOU to @LeadToday @Ranal55 @GetInControl @WrestleFigures @Noraj @WAlexanderSMC @timetorelive and @sillydumb for adding me on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That felt like a booger.... #thoughtsonatrain #gross #scaredtolook #eww<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>....I'm gonna pop some tags..... #ThriftShop #StillLikeIt #ThoughtsOnAPlane<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Once I let go, I found that the dude invading my personal space from the middle seat was an accomplished cuddler.  #thoughtsonaplane #Travel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dammit James Arthur....great, now I'm crying....#SayYouWontLetGo #ThoughtsOnAPlane #tooearlyforthis<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's Be Cops isn't a horrible movie.  #thoughtsonaplane #TravelTuesday #needhashtags #wasntgreateither #LetBeCops<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sat next to a man twice my size. Sitting at a 45 degree angle sucks. Snack cart smacked my head.  Twice.#fatguyslittleplane  #TravelTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, everything I couldn't say while in flight, starting with, what up ATL?  #traveling #HartsfieldJackson #Floridabound #Delta<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good morning @BruceVH!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stupid jokes aside, which, should be forgivable before 12, I will be @Raleighwood this Sunday night hosting the Oscars.  #Oscars2017 #Oscars<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey Atlanta.  I'm about to be in you.  #sorry #thatwasdumb #needcoffee #airport #Airportflow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Morning @carlasimmons03, @BlacckCocaine, and @logantstark! Thanks for making me a part of your social worlds!  Have a great day! #gratitude<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need precheck in my life.  And skinnier thumbs.  And 30 fewer pounds.  #TSA #Airport #sinceimwishingforstuff #AirportFlow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plus, I accidentally hit the woman in front of me with my belt.  She seemed to like it, both times, but that's not the point. #TSA #Airport<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I get the safety aspect, but I get winded tying, then untying, then tying my shoes.  Can't always rock slip-ons.  #Airport #AirportFlow #TSA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I should just roll to the airport in my pj's, then get dressed.  It seems more efficient than getting dressed only to undress for screening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If they bust out in song, I'm done.  #TheWalkingDead #TWD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The travel ban had a "smooth rollout"? The court was the only thing that was wrong? "80%" of the time? Idiot.  #TrumpPressConference<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Now that's just poor sportsmanship Baron.  #SDLive #WWE #SmackDownLIVE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I never appreciated @GStephanopoulos as much as I should have.  Until now.  Get'em George.  #GMA #KellyanneConwayInterview<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Could you imagine her as a defense attorney?  Valedictorian of the Johnny Cochran School of Law.  #TrumpsAmerica #geeez<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I heart Kellyanne Conway.  Simply because of her ability to never answer anything. #TrumpsAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just discovered that I was not asleep when Emmalina debuted. Apparently I had just blinked and missed it. WTF @WWE?  #RAW #RAWVegas<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That was amazing!  #WomensTitle #RAW #RAWVegas #WWE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hell of a match right now!  #WomensTitle #WWE #RAWVegas #RAW<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jokes aside, it's awesome to see the women in the main event.  #WWE #RAW #RAWlasvegas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kilik I think....#Neville #RAW #WWE #RAWlasvegas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anyone know if Neville was one of the dwarves in the Hobbit trilogy?  #WWE #RAW #hobbit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Calling it now.  Charlotte is fine AF, Bayley wins, Emma helps, I regret not recording this.  #RAW #WWE #Emmalina #RAWlasvegas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...........#RAW #WWE #RAWlasvegas #RAWTonight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You think Zayne and Enzo are in the back each week going, "Naw man, I got my ass whooped last week, your turn tonight"? #WWE #RAWlasvegas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doesn't matter.  As long as he has Lana, he's always winning.  #RAW #RAWlasvegas #RAWTonight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmm, wonder if Rusev feels as ridiculous as he looks right now? #RAW #RAWTonight #RAWlasvegas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New Day...Rocks!  New Day....Rocks!  #RAW #RAWVegas #WWE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spencerspicy can't stand that guy.  I will say that I think Charlotte is a straight beast, and I look forward to whatever she does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't they mean Mark Henry will job out to Braun tonight?  #RAW #WWE #RAWTonight #RAWVegas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh no!  Roman is getting beat up.  I. Did, Not. See. This. Coming. #RAW #RAWTonight #wwe #RAWVegas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spencerspicy Lana is my excuse....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is @ColonyUSA any good?  Been thinking about adding it to the rotation.  #Colony #TVShow #DondeEstaLaBiblioteca #USA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Her Teddy Long impersonation was uncanny.  #RAWTonight #RAWVegas #WWE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey.  I was just watching Raw, and um, I think Steph may have had some work done. Hope I don't bust a bubble with that.  #RAW #RAWVegas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frostedevents and @itstimwhite Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She just did a moonsault on Alexa Bliss's ass to end the match. Super ineffective strategy, totally jealous. #WWE #WWEChamber #NewChamp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2 things about the @WWE PPV last night, was the ring announcer watching the matches? Where did Carmella's accent go? #eliminationchamber<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think that's just indicative of how amazing @Adele is as an artist. #Congrats #GRAMMYs #grammys2017 #GrammyAwards #GRAMMYLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As great as "Hello" is, I feel like this deserved an award too.  #GrammyAwards #GRAMMYs #grammys2017 #GRAMMYLive   https://t.co/gnzjGlUotq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quick shout to @84LumberNews. Thank you for your commercial.The message at the end is right on time, whether you planned it that way or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Totally random thought. How cool would it be to get piano lessons from John Legend? I'd learn "Ordinary People". #GRAMMYs #grammyawards2017<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So that wasn't the lady from "Meet The Browns"?  My bad...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait...has Kirk Franlin always been that small?  I didn't know the lady from "Meet The Browns" could sing like that. #GRAMMYs #GrammyAwards<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'll be watching tonight and sharing thoughts, who's joining me?  #debates #debatenight #debate2016 #PresidentialDebates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SetYourOwnLimit thank you for following!  Much appreciated!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ErickBaker you made it an incredible memory.  Thanks for taking the time to let us hang.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wish I could pick a boat up with my mind.  At least the remote.  Or my keys.  #TheFlash #FlashTweet #TheFlashSeason3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@APDillon_  not disagreeing with you on the salary, we could do better overall, and I believe we will, but we're not there yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you, I misspoke.  What I should have said, was "taken care of". Still a broad statement, hope this clarifies:   https://t.co/7nQfffN6Kg  https://t.co/RklfiDTRMX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrDeborahFisher thank you so much for the follow!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For me, the clear winner here was David Crabtree.  #ncgovdebate #debates #Debates2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's like McCrory doesn't realize he's in NC. I want to visit this fantasyland he runs, the one where teachers are paid well. #ncgovdebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Cecil invented keyless entry, so now he can run the state.  Ok.  #ncgovdebate #debates #Debates2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another point for David Crabtree. #ncgovdebate #debates #Debates2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My word Cecil's ears are HUGE....wonder if he heard me type that.  #ncgovdebate #debates #Debates2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bangarang David Crabtree!  #ncgovdebate #debates #Debates2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did Lon Cecil just roll out of bed, throw on a suit, and come to the debate. #ncgovdebate #Debates2016 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So then no.  #ncgovdebate #debate #debate2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bangarang Roy! #ncgovdebate #debate #debate2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dude, you signed off on it.  There is no way to spin it so that you come out in a positively.  #ncgovdebate #debate #debate2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>McCrory is a jackass. Own up man damn. #ncgubernatorialdebate #debate #debate2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is anyone else watching the NC Gubernatorial debate? #ncgovernordebate #debate #debate2016<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Dammit McCrory, why are you still interrupting my television shows?  I'd vote for Cooper just because he runs his ads at reasonable times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarinaRocksLife Maybe if they'd had Trump's wall.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@CarinaRocksLife True. Sucks for everyone that was in the way.  Eight people in NC alone so far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@CarinaRocksLife Agreed.  Kinda shocked no one even mentioned Hurricane Matthew....needed that to win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I didn't win.  #PresidentialDebate #Debates #debate #Debate2016  https://t.co/l2ld9iUpT0<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Props to the Clintons for getting out there and mingling.  Donald should be taking notes.  #PresidentialDebate #Debates #debate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alright, final thought.  We're screwed America.  #PresidentialDebate #FearFactor #Debates #debate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy shit.  One compliment followed by 3 knocks.  He can't help himself.  #PresidentialDebate #Debates #Debate #Debates2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well played Hillary.  Well played.  #PresidentialDebate #debate #Debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well this should be interesting.  #PresidentialDebate #debate #Debates #Debate2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you don't know the answer, just say so. That's coming directly from Johnny Cochran. #PresidentialDebate #ChewbaccaDefense #Debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So he just attacked Obama and the EPA? #PresidentialDebate #Debates #Debates2016 #debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funny.  A crook calling out a crook.  #PresidentialDebate #Debates #debate #debates2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good question.  Can't wait to see how he turns this on Hillary.  #spinmaster #PresidentialDebate #Debates #debate #Debates2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's more of a politician than she is.  #PresidentialDebate #Debates #Debates2016 #debate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why did he say "latino" with an accent? A bad one at that.  #PresidentialDebate #Debates #debate #Debates2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hell yeah.  He's gonna grab this country by the pussy in the most devoted manner possible. #PresidentialDebate #Debates2016 #debate #Debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lower the mic man, damn.  Just try to let her finish.  #PresidentialDebate #Debates2016 #debate #Debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man, I wish I could make up that many endorsements on the spot.  #PresidentialDebate #Debates2016 #Debates #debate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@amstel_lad the retweet is appreciated!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WatersLight1, thanks for the retweet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Where's Donald's wedding ring? Or does he normally not wear one?  #PresidentialDebate #Debates2016 #Debates #debate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meanwhile, somewhere Gary Johnson has shifted his search for pussy to around the Libya.  #PresidentialDebate #Debates2016 #Debates #debate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dude. Bragging on yourself about avoiding taxes, just exploits guilt. #doubletalk #PresidentialDebate #Debates #Debates2016 #debate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn. That's a lot of zeros.  #PresidentialDebate #Debates #debate #Debates2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bro.  She doesn't need to spend money for ads to make you look bad.  You do it for free.  #PresidentialDebate #Debates #Debates2016 #debate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait.  Didn't you say you didn't pay taxes in the last debate?  #PresidentialDebate #debate #Debates #Debates2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dammit Hillary, just say yes.  #PresidentialDebate #Debates #debate #Debates2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"We're just gonna grab those syrians by the pussy." - Donald Trump #PresidentialDebate #Debates2016 #debate #Debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Extreme Vetting".  I'm not up on my political jargon.  Is that a thing?  #PresidentialDebate #Debates #Debates2016 #debate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OuraniatheQueen I appreciate the retweet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomfrank_bliss thanks for the retweet!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What the hell did that have to do with anything?  #PresidentialDebate #debate #debate2016 #Debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did a fly just land on her face?  #PresidentialDebate #Debates #debate #debate2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a bi-racial person, this pandering for votes is shameless and highly offensive.  #PresidentialDebate #Debates #debate #debate2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's who he is when he thinks no one is listening.  #PresidentialDebate #debate #Debates #debate2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is his face doing right now?  #PresidentialDebate #debate #Debates #debate2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Totally respects them.  When he forcibly grabs the pussy, he does it gently. #PresidentialDebate #Debates #debate #debate2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How did this become about ISIS? #PresidentialDebate #debate #debate2016 #Debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get him Anderson!  #Debates #debate #debate2016 #PresidentialDebate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Meanwhile, somewhere, Gary Johnson has found Aleppo, but, was so exhausted from the search, he fell asleep. #Debates #Debates2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dotfelixb She definitely exposed him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@dotfelixb I agree with that.  I just feel like there could have been more detail given.  So much deviation from the questions asked.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dOiHaVeIssuEs Thanks for retweeting!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's like an old episode of "Fear Factor". Eat the raw donkey nuts, or drink the warm squirrel shit milkshake?  #Debates #PresidentialDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I literally watched this whole thing and feel no more knowledgeable than I did going in.  Lots of words.  Not a lot of plans.  #Debates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meanwhile...somewhere, Gary Johnson just realized that he couldn't find Aleppo, because he couldn't spell it.  #Debates #debatenight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We get two more of these?  Yay! #Debates #debatenight #PresidentialDebate #Debate2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Really?  Inappropriate?  Dude, you picked on a handicapped reporter.  Hypocrite much? #Debates #PresidentialDebate #Debate2016 #debatenight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Something, somethiing, Melania said you had no stamina either....there's a joke in there somewhere. #Debates #Debate2016 #PresidentialDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lester, come on man.  He just punked you out, and didn't answer your question.  #Debates #debatenight #PresidentialDebate #Debate2016<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Dude.  That's a yes or no question.  #debates #Debate2016 #debatenight #PresidentialDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah.  Cause constantly interrupting her while she speaks on your temper issues is a great way to prove her wrong.  #debates #Debates2016<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Meanwhile...Gary Johnson is still looking at a map, found Syria, looking for Aleppo...#Debates #debatenight #Debates2016 #PresidentialDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll bet Obama's at home like, "what the hell did I do?" #debate #debatenight #Debate2016 #PresidentialDebate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wait.  You just said 3,000.  1,000 more people just died while you were searching for words?  #debates #debatenight #Debate2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear God in Heaven, please let him say something about a wall.  Please.  #debatenight #debates #PresidentialDebate #Debate2016<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Seriously Lester, grow a pair.  #debates #debatenight #Debate2016 #PresidentialDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hillary should have been in marketing.  She's giving him some of the coolest slogans.  #TrumpedUpTrickleDown #Debates #PresidentialDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does the bureaucratic tape have to be red?  Why not blue? Or Magenta? What about a nice Mother Of Pearl?  #debates #PresidentialDebates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey hey, he knows how to fight ISIS.  He knows more than the Generals do.  #debates #debatenight #Debates2016 #PresidentialDebates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another shameless plug.  Damn she's good.  #Debates2016 #debates #PresidentialDebates #debatenight<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What?!!! But we'll have a wall..... #debates #debatenight #PresidentialDebate #Debates2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The wall Lester.  He already said it.  The wall will keep the companies here.  #debates #debatenight #PresidentialDebate #Debates2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice of Trump to de-orange himself tonight.  Very considerate.  #debates #Debates2016 #PresidentialDebate #Debates2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Trumped Up Trickle Down".  Wow.  Catchy, but wow.  #debatenight #PresidentialDebate #debatenight #Debates2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well now the wall makes sense.  That's how Trump plans to keep jobs here.  #gotit #debate #debatenight #PresidentialDebate #Debates2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man that's a lot of chin Trump has.  #debates #debatenight #PresidentialDebate #Debates2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does Trump look like he's fighting sleep?  #debates #debatenight #PresidentialDebate #Debates2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Um.  What's a paycheck?" - Donald Trump.  #debates #Debates2016 #debatenight #PresidentialDebate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This video by @RVGisFUNNY needs to be watched!  https://t.co/6IRQFHdFIr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm rocking black and white stripes man. You need someone in a blue polo, with a name tag indicating they work here. #Walmart #idontworkhere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sore throat and I feel like ass. Side note, I am on the Comedy Bus today at 5.  Come out, watch me die slowly whilst I talk about dead folk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Pari_MD thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jnelsoncomedy thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hello there.  #thinkskinnythoughts #sohungrytho  https://t.co/X3tynBgwWZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Open mic'n at London Bridge. Let's talk about pregnancy scares. #hopetheylaugh #standup #comedy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus. So over commercials with him justifying his ignorance. Let me watch Big Bang Theory in peace. #HB2 #reasontovote #McCrorysucks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This sounds amazing!  Is this my only opportunity to try this magical brew?  https://t.co/25ILk3z9K5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally got a decent vid to submit to stuff.  Well, hope it's decent enough. Could ha e used it last week, but whatever #fingerscrossed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LaurelleMartin thanks for following!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanielG89461478 thanks for retweeting!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@DanielG89461478 her cold, souless, eyes? I'd sooner stare into the eyes of a Great White as it took an "exploratory bite". More emotion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pres_not_sure and @BerniesHomie thanks for the retweet!  Her face bugs me, never moves! #RobLoweRoast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching the Rob Lowe Roast again, it's like Ann Coulter didn't realize they were insulting her.  HE CALLED YOU A CUNT.  #RobLoweRoast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@purdyholsom she bombed so bad too!  I feel bad celebrating negative, but it was amazing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeudi39 @305FoLife right on.  Did you se that too?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>From now on, I'm asking where people parked before I say bye.  We said bye, been walking side by side in silence for 6 minutes. #Awkward<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @jeudi39 and @305FoLife, thanks for liking that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the fuck is she wearing?  Why did she agree to do this?  #Painful #LoweRoast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's the first boo.  That took a lot longer to come than expected.  #LoweRoast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The crowd's faces tho...#LoweRoast #CoulterSucks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still on Coulter's face.  Seriously disturbing.  Is it face paralysis? Or is it just hard to show emotion when you have no soul? #LoweRoast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jewel is going in!  #roastofroblowe #roblowe #suckitcoulter #LoweRoast<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Loving this roast of Rob Lowe!  But what's with Coulter's face? For real, does she have bottom teeth?  #roblowe #robloweroast #ComedyCentral<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>52 - 6?  #Damn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another example of something better than "Brocoli".  Well, maybe not "better". #mayneverlistentotheradioagain https://youtu.be/XArx0ASwyDc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two examples of anything better than "Brocoli". #garbagerap #madnow #dudeowesmethreeminutesofmylifeback  https://t.co/Y6fYhfS0fr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two shows tonight @ComedyZoneClayt 8 and 10.  Really funny people will say really funny things, and I'll be there too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just heard that song "Broccoli". Makes me miss Froggy Fresh.  Finally, something worse than 50 Tyson. #awful #usedtolikebrocoli<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Strugglin'.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@letgo thanks for the commercials!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And then there were four.  #GhostTown #Syfy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Props to @letgo, your commercials rock.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What if she'd have ducked?  It only squished her head by 3 inches.  Just sayin'. Lopsided head crush. #Syfy #GhostTown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He's being drawn and quartered.  Shouting out, "it'll be ok" it incorrect.  And a lie.  #yourefucked #syfy #GhostTown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two of your friends just died awful deaths, can we at least try an act like it matters? #GhostTown #Syfy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Light went out.  Damn.  Not good.  #GhostTown #Syfy #bingingonbadmovies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You were at the door! You were in the clear!  Why did you go into a bedroom?  #GhostTown #Syfy #ohmyheart<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wait.  How did we get to wandering off into the mist with a rope tied around us? #GhostTown #Syfy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Engine died.  Bet $5 the driver gets it when he goes to fix it. #GhostTown #Syfy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Sweet! An abandoned town.  Let's stop there." #youregonnadie #GhostTown #Syfy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes.  Yes they do hate you for it.  #GhostTown #Syfy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ooooh, he shot a priest.  #GhostTown #Syfy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aw.  That's just f^*#@* up right there. #GhostTown #Syfy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why? Why would you run outside towards the gunfire? With no gun? #GhostTown #Syfy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see your flight suit Kahled.  I also see your nipple.  #zipuphomie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Simone!  #VMAs #VMAs2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't hate on Eazy.  If Britney Spears touched my dick, I'd have fucked up too.  #VMAs #VMAs2016 #MTVVMAs #MTVVideoMusicAwards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's ironic.  My grandma once knitted a blanket that looked like Ty Dolla Sign's shirt.  Her's was blue though.  #VMA #VMAs2016 #MTVVMAs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Samsung is killing it with these commercials.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@josephishope thanks!  Already started watching.  He's just so talented.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope that's the end of this.  Not because I don't want to see more, but because who can follow that?  #damn #VMAs #VMAs2016 #MTVVMAs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ooooh, and she even did the dance she's being accused of stealing.  #WendyWilliams #VMAs2016 #VMAs #MTVVideoMusicAwards #MTVVMAs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, the VMAs had no time limit tonight?  We just gonna watch a live version of "Lemonade"?  #VMAs2016 #VMAs #MTVVideoMusicAwards<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@josephishope is that on Youtube?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Aloe Blacc makes me want to buy some M&amp;Ms and eat them while rolling with the windows down, blasting their theme song. #anditfeelsogood<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My grandma once had a shower curtain that looked a lot like Ty $'s jacket.  #VMA #MTVVideoMusicAwards #MTVVMAs2016 #MTVVMAs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn.  Rita Ora's shoes.  Just another example of anything more popular than she is.  #MTVVideoMusicAwards #MTVVMAs #VMA #MTVVMAs2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the f*&amp;# was that? Was there words in that song? Did I just spend three minutes objectifying a cat? #VMA #MTVVideoMusicAwards #MTVVMAs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is it time for Luke Cage yet @netflix?  #LukeCage #Marvel #Defenders #MCU #PatientlyWaiting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I'd been one of the dudes at the end of Ariana's performance...might have stole a lick. Don't care if my tongue would've fell off. #VMAs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All the other girls look classy and sexy.  She look like she got caught in a fishing net. #MTVVMA #FifthHarmony #MTV #VMAs2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Michael Harrison and Andy Forrester? Sweet!  #outandabout #livecomedy #cftmc  https://t.co/e7iA3Zw2w3<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>At her peak, I said that Iggy Azalea could stop rapping and I wouldn't even notice. She just dropped her first single in a year? #IWasRight<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Finn is like the robot off of "Lost In Space", just not as cool.  #Sharknado4 #SharknadoParty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She's like f*&amp;^in' Iron Man!  #Sharknado4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy ^^^^, she flies too?  #characterdevelopment #Sharknado4 #SharknadoParty<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What the F*^% is that? #Sharknado4 #SharknadoParty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The eyepatch works.  She should adopt that look.  #Sharknado4 #SharknadoParty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They gave the 5yr old a chainsaw.  #Yes #Sharknado4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But...his suit had wings.....#Sharknado4 #SharknadoParty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tommy Davidson dies in 3,2,1...... #Sharknado4 #SharknadoParty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Um.  Is that a regulation pilot uniform?  #Sharknado4 #SharknadoParty<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Bet kissing her tastes like Penzoil.  #Sharknado4 #sharknado #SharknadoParty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay.  I'll admit it.  Wasn't expecting that when she unzipped.  #Sharknado4 #SharknadoParty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stacey Dash gets it in the next 5 minutes. Bet.  #Sharknado4 Sharknado<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Finn flies now?  #CharacterDevelopment #Sharnado4 #SharknadoParty #sharknado<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>.@BobbyBG33k my bad.  That needs to happen too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Throw in a Trump and Clinton buffet for the sharks and this will be my favorite movie ever.  #Sharknado4 #SharknadoParty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jessica Alba?  Couldn't find a better irrelevant actress?  #MechanicResurrection #Honest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What are the chances we'll see a Kardashian get eaten tonight?  That would really take this movie to the next level for me.  #Sharknado4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This would make a great AllState commercial.  #Sharknado4 #sharknado #SharknadoParty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I mean, she went out like a G and stuff, but why didn't she just shoot the shark eating her arm? She could have lived man.... #Sharknado4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hold up.  Nova's not in this?  #Damn #Sharknado4 #sharknado #SharknadoParty<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Is there anything Ian Zerring can't do?  #Sharknado4 #sharknado<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Those isotopes look like ecto-cooler from Hi-C.  #Sharknado4 #SharknadoParty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can you imagine dirty talk from Gilbert Gotfried?  Bet that voice has dried more than a few vaginas in it's time.  #Sharknado4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's the most badass tornado ever.  #Sharknado4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please tell me Dog gets ate up.  Please.  #Sharknado4 #SharknadoParty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ghostbusters.  The answer to "who you gonna call?", is always Ghostbusters. #Sharknado4 #sharknado #SharknadoParty<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Bad idea coming in 3, 2, 1.... #Sharknado4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So much for my previous statement about Carrot Top.  #Sharknado4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, pull the shoot, that'll solve the problem.  #Sharknado4 #SharknadoParty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sexiest. Scientists. Ever. #Sharknado4 #SharknadoParty<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That feeling you get when you start to question if you're at the right gate because it should be boarding and it's not. Flight's in 15 min.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My plan for the weekend is to annou everyone I speak to by pronouncing it Te-has, instead of Texas.  #SettingGoals<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Why @TFconTweets? Why? #Bummed #TransformersFoLife #ComeBack  Soon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As I was driving around this morning blasting "The Touch" by Stan Bush, I was bummed by the thought that TFCon isn't coming to NC this year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.............WTF?.........#TWDFinale #TheWalkingDead #TWDFinalein6words<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Arrgggghhhh!!!!! The suspense!!!! #TWDFinale #TheWalkingDead #TWDFinalein6words #TWD<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Oh Jesus, I hope my heart can handle it.  #TheWalkingDead #TWDFinale #TWD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedRider778 thanks for the retweet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WTF just happened?!!! #TWD #WalkingDead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So who's dying? Daryl or Glen? #WalkingDead #TWD #TheWalkingDead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So nobody learned from the last time they all left Alexandria? #TWD #TheWalkingDead #TheWalkingDumb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last thing, but outside of the whole family from Fear The Walking Dead, haven't hoped for someone to die that much in a while. #LoisLane<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone would assume the worst when you shoot out their tires prick.  #TheWalkingDead #TWD #WalkingDead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gonna stop my ranting about B V S and focus on Walking Dead, which, wish I'd stayed home to watch instead.  #BatmanvSuperman #TWD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I guess I'm disappointed because I thought DC was going to make a serious run at Marvel on the big screen. #BatmanvSuperman #DawnOfJustice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel like the reason why so many people are going to see this is because of it's bad reviews. #BatmanvSuperman #DawnOfJustice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Totally dug Ben Affleck as Batman/Bruce Wayne.  I didn't think I would, but I did.  #BatmanvSuperman #DawnOfJustice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like Gail Gadot and all, but she's just not right for the part.... #WonderWoman #BatmanvSuperman #DawnOfJustice #Underwhelmed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If it's only been 18 months, why does Lous Lane look 40-something now? #BatmanvSuperman #DawnOfJustice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@josephishope Nope.  Don't do it.  Not if you're even slightly familiar with storylines or enjoy ones that make sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's my general synopsis. #BatmanvSuperman #DawnOfJustice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow....that was pretty damn dumb.....#BatmanvSuperman #DawnOfJustice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@josephishope happy to.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm gonna make a break for the door....soon as the room stops spinning....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tried to escape the room my fiance has confined me to, but the "I gave up a rib for you" argument fell flat.  My vulnerability make me cute.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I look and feel like shit.  I could be a Walking Dead right now, with no makeup. Got the walk down too.  Being dizzy af helps with that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only made it through 5 episodes so far, but damn, this is awesome. #DaredevilSeason2 #Daredevil<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Love Jodie Sweetin, but um, what was that face? #DancingWithTheStars #DWTS22 #DWTS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I've not seen the Hulk Hogan tape, but I read it was only 90 sec long. That's honestly 75 seconds longer than I thought his old ass could.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@josephishope Toys R Us.  @ToysRUs we mentioned you.  Keep marking stuff down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bought a suit at the Macy's closing down up the road for less than $200. The real highlight was the GI Joes on clearance at TRU for $10.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robotswcoffee I agree.  Wish I had more time.  Won't even get to hit an open mic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And website is updated. Always open to criticism, check it out and give some feedback if you're bored.  https://t.co/IFAaELgaIB. I won't cry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robotswcoffee lol.  I just appreciate you taking the time to give me ideas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robotswcoffee If I get freed up.  Uber might be my best bet on this one though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's weird how, you think you're on top of something, like a website...and then you look at it, and realize, not so much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Add a check box for this place on my to-do list when in Chi-town this week. People still call it that right?    https://t.co/gkewzQCELh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robotswcoffee Thanks for the suggestions, I'll let you know how it goes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robotswcoffee The arcade spot sounds awesome!  That's on my to-do.  And I definitely want to hit up one of those toy stores.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robotswcoffee But, what is the one thing I need to check out, above all else, in the 24hr period?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robotswcoffee work stuff for the day gig.  Just a one day up, crash, and head back thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robotswcoffee Good to know!  Didn't want to get stuck inside. Probably will anyway, but not because of anything cool like snow.  Thanks!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Congrats though.  #MissAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think a person's "cry face" should factor in to the competition somehow.  Yes Ms. Georgia, I'm talking about you...don't cry...really....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kinda crappy how they announce the winner.  So one wins it all, the other two are total losers.  Nice.  #MissAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Winnie Cooper!!!!!! #MissAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Epic fail Georgia.  Way to contradict yourself.  #MissAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In honor of tonight's event....  https://t.co/0RceGLB1Vw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wanna see a contestant get on stage with an electric guitar and just go to town...or nail a killer drum solo.  #MissAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, I won't hate....that was good.....still would have preferred Blu....#MissAmerica<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Oh please do "Devil Went Down To Georgia".  #MissAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What about singing on key?  Is that possible?  #MissAmerica #IBelieve<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I don't have a talent, so I'll divert from that fact with a super sad story."  Wrong lady, your talent is bumming folks out.  #MissAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great story, but is that really considered a talent?  #MissAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the hell is this?  #MissAmerica<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Fact:  I just googled how to spell "homie".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just embarrassed myself in front of a blind dude.  Was feeling stupid, then I thought about the fact that he probably didn't notice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, "Hannah" sounds awful.  Come on Ethan,  you can do better.   #DumpHannah #YourFriendsHateYou<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At the local beergarden waiting on my girl, listening to the loud group next to me.  Don't know who "Ethan" is, but he needs new friends.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So far, this is like the "Napolean Dynamite" of horror flicks.  #ItFollows<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching "It Follows".  Don't know what "It" is, but damn it's violent.  #ItFollows #WatchingAlone #JustStarted<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dramatic speech and 3, 2, 1..... dead #ZombieShark<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quick check for understanding.  The hot girl just got ate by a shark head......no body...just a head.....#ZombieShark<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Literally.   It's just his legs.  #3HeadedSharkAttack #WheresHoward<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What happened to "Stay.  Calm."?  #3HeadedSharkAttack<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Howard's dead..... #3HeadedSharkAttack #WheresHoward<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have it figured out.  They kill the shark with a 5-Star Frogsplash.  #3HeadedSharkAttack<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh shit!  Is that Rob Van Dam?!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Siamese Shark Attack!  #2HeadedSharkAttack<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder what ideas for titles they scrapped for this movie.  #2HeadedSharkAttack<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What?  Carmen Electra too!  Aw yeah......  #2HeadedSharkAttack<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact that Brooke Hogan is in this just makes even better.  She's still alive right?  #2HeadedSharkAttack<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Perfect day for cheesy movies on Syfy.  I'm enjoying 2 Headed Shark Attack.  It's like a regular shark attack, just twice the heads.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I can't help but wonder if Hasselhoff even knows what he's saying.   And why does he sound wasted?  #Sharknado3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why are they on the roof still?  And why is he such a puss?  #Sharknado3<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yeah man, you can have the shit plane.  Good luck.   #Sharknado3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hold up.  A f^^king shark just fell out of the sky and ate a dude, and no one's phased?  People just went back to riding rides? #Sharknado3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Badass.  #TaraReid #Sharknado3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nova's hotter.  #Sharknado3<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'm in a relationship.  I may run to the end of my chain and bark a lot, but I'd be terrified if someone actually stepped in the yard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On the way out of town, but not be we stop at Tamarack!  Cause that's what men do.....antiquing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Show's over, time to go back to the cabin.  Tomorrow I head home to hang with little dude and the lady.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Came for a tune up, $1400 is total so far, and none of it includes a tune up.  The words "tune" and "up" have not been said in tandem yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have to be so bad, but scared to go after the homeless dude just came out.  #ignoranttweet #profiling #whatsthatawfulsmell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shout out to Aseem sitting next to me at Merchant's for letting use his phone to Tweet.  #word #sittinatmerchants #1400dollarslater #broke<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>At least UCLA scored.....#hookupfail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Starting to pull for this guy....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>He's going for the tricycle.....glasses and fake tits.....hope fake tits invests in a fake laugh.....if she's "fixing" flaws......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@josephishope he's going for the tricycle.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am no longer a fan of the phrase "turn down for what".  Fucker ruined my jam.....stupid self tanned penis jerk.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So glad I didn't talk about Schroedinger's cat. #shouldhaveskippedthehistorystufftoo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hehehe....Rusty Nuts....#Iam12  http://t.co/t6Fmdq0xiH<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>10 million phones sold over launch weekend......wow.  You go Apple.  Curious to see what the Note 4 will do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Playing Call of Duty.  Killing people in a video game helps me unwind.  #isitokaytosaythat?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I finally got the interview......hope they were impressed with my ability to eat a giant bag o' dicks.  #blewit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not hating, just stating......the lines outside some of these carriers for the "new" IPhone are quite impressive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is "The Strain" on Hulu?  Way behind.  Is it worth catching up?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dammit Fiat, your commercials are now a part of me.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, I see some of the moms out here dancing and I KNOW that is not how you would be dancing elsewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did we ever find out what the fox actually says?  Just spent 3 min listening to hypotheses, nothing that seemed definitive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So there's a dance area here.  Witness to generations of bad dancing now.  Not my kid.  Though I will make an exception for Gangam Style.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@josephishope ha!  I'm sneaking in first chance I get......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dang lady, those shorts are mighty short....someone wants to be a mommy again.......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why must these tiny people scream so loudly for no reason?  Oh wait, it's a bouncy obstacle course!  #imscreamingtoonow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The hardest part of this experience is seeing the bounce houses and not being able to play in them.  #tweetsfromabench<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They're just jealous.  #transformersrule #tweetsfromabench<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@josephishope right on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I mean come on, dude next to me is wearing a hawaiin shirt, no one's brow beating him.  #tweetsfromabench<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't look like any of the parents here.  Didn't know I needed a polo, they seem to frown on the Decepticon logo t-shirt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At my 5yr old's school picnic watching a "harlem shake" contest.  Makes me sad they'll never know the break your neck, pull a muscle version<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TNNIrishpub tonight for the open mic, so cool that so many folks came out despite the weather.  #thankyou #righton<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that's great.  This drop of water that landed perfectly on my shirt, along with tits from the weight gain, looks like I'm lactating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Okay, who saw Ninja Turtles last night?  Was it good?  Need to know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's that moment when, in a public place, you began singing along with "Let It Go", and you were the last person to notice.....#atthebarfail<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#fin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hopefully I'm wrong, she just started with a cover.  The rest will be all original music.  And if not, hey, people liked All For One.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How does covering that song qualify this girl as an "artist on the verge"?  Verge of what?  Stealing someone else's shit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The differences are so subtle it's like the difference in the beat between "Under Pressure" and "Ice Ice Baby".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Has "Big Bang" been around long enough to justify someone doing a cover of it?  Not too mention it songs pretty much the same.  Exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What?!!!! That was it?  #WalkingDeadSeasonFinale<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This new new Purge movie looks sick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn Rick.. #WalkingDeadSeasonFinale<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TWDQuotesTwo @WalkingDeadQts Sup?!  I'll check it out.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Seriously.....Transformers trailer? Anyone?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn Denver, bout time for a "blackout" isn't it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yeah, yeah,  touchdown Seattle.   Did anybody record that Transformers trailer?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KayArePea just because<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Challenge already?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lovely voice....but Boyz II Men's will always be my favorite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just me or was that anthem a little off?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At the Carolina - State game.  Apparently,  State forgot to show up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still hot though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow, Kacey Musgraves, awfully short lamp shade don't ya think?  #GRAMMYs<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Realest, most humble and awesome acceptance speech award, just went to Lorde.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FunnyManLando her dancing scares me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I understand that Shakira was in the commercial too, but does Target actually sell a microphone like that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lorde kinda scares me when she dances.....#GRAMMYs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>See what I just did there?  #stupid<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@josephishope didn't see that.  Poo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What happened San Fran?  Dang.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I meant "when we", for the record.  The TV was on behind her, and I'm a horrible multi-tasker......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have learned through first hand experience, that is literally as far as you will get in that sentence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guys, when talking about the future of your relationship with you lady, never start a sentence off with, "When I decide to have a baby...."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Should log off, no filter on the stupidity flowing out of my dome......Quality Control is on lunch......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is the song "Sweater Weather" about getting a handjob?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm still going to watch.....just giving up on the osmosis thing.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I give up....been watching Univision a lot lately hoping to regain any understanding of the Spanish language through osmosis...laziness sux.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Told her how much time was left....thought I heard sobbing on the couch behind me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Totally makes up for the Twilight marathon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At the part where the ring gets dropped into the lava and she thinks it's almost over.....sucker......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And she's cracked.....#watchingthelordoftheringsmovieswithmygirlforthefirsttime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@herbiemac the open mic doesn't start back until 1/13.  From Napper's, it's only 8 minutes (or so depending on traffic).<|endoftext|>
