<|startoftext|>@bigtex54 @TheRising1776 @ushockme69 @KelemenCari You’re welcome and thank you as well!🇺🇸 I’ll ask my friend tomorrow. He is a Trump supporter me yapping at him puts a smirk on his face at times. I think he knows more than I thought. I’ll report back.

<|startoftext|>@bigtex54 @TheRising1776 @ushockme69 @KelemenCari I was wondering about that.... Rods of God? I dunno! I’m going to rifle through local fb posts. Maybe someone saw SOMETHING?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRising1776 @bigtex54 @ushockme69 @KelemenCari Funny enough the Calais label is removed from Google maps now. You just get an outline. 🤣  https://t.co/0wnf29gedS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey #Google, why is #Calais #Maine label removed off #maps? Just outline of the town line? #bunkerbusting maybe??? 2 earthquakes in 2 hours ? #earthquake #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver  https://t.co/c1yAXQCBZB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigtex54 @ushockme69 @TheRising1776 @KelemenCari I have only looked into Trimble Mountsin area not the second one. I’ll do that tonight and see what’s there:)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@work2hard2fight @CollinsKellyE @EmeraldRobinson ALSO , EO in 2017, seizing all assets of anyone found guilty in crimes against humanity. Tick tock. Time to pay is drawing near.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigtex54 @ushockme69 @TheRising1776 @KelemenCari Hello Texas friend!:) They were actually two “earthquakes” that morning about two hours apart. That location, you can damn near spit into the ocean/Canada. My friend grew up there. Fact tunnels are there. Loring AFB is here as well. Guarded 24/7 to this day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigtex54 @ushockme69 @TheRising1776 @KelemenCari Me? Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ushockme69 @TheRising1776 @KelemenCari There are underground tunnels all through that area. That’s a #fact. You can see Canada from land. St Croix river meets the ocean there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCLeo6 100% fact there are old tunnels there that you could drive a truck through. They used them to move liquor. The area calls certain areas “Gin bay” etc to this day. You can see where St Croix hits the ocean. Canada right there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thebradfordfile @RepSwalwell  https://t.co/EPi7HIhNRV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCLeo6 Agreed.... seems it’s definitely highest point? The way the road goes around up to it. Measured building length on google, roughly 100’. Reportedly Ballots came on ships through Maine. 9-11 bombers also came through Maine. Nothing would surprise me any more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCLeo6 *Trimble<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCLeo6 Google street view of one of the #Maine “earthquake” locations... Thrimble Mountain. I asked hubby what he thought this was. He asked where, I told him. His answer? “It’s A lookout”.  https://t.co/qIFRa6nrIQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCLeo6 Rods of God???🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RCLeo6 Definitely had 2 earthquakes here in Maine, roughly 2 hours apart<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>November 25 earthquake in #Maine. In #Jackman. Where one of the 9-11 bombers crossed into the United States. 🧐 #earthquake #maine #dumbs #ccp  https://t.co/edJArPJvYB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HectorKatsu @GidgetM7 The map shows the second one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HectorKatsu @GidgetM7 There were 2 “earthquakes” that morning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If the Chinese were in Maine in underground bunkers, and cross the Bay of Fundy by boat to get here, and we had no idea, guess what else can do the same? #BALLOTS (remember they said ballots came into Maine via boat?)  #maine #ccp #bayoffundy  #DUMBS<|endoftext|>
