<|startoftext|>@Gunny_Q One guy said it twice.... Not a entire group of protestors on one accord. Also I saw no signs so doubt they were actual protestors. Trouble makers do exist. So yea. Definitely in contrast to what the sheriff is trying to put out there. They’re lying for sympathy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let’s talk about the executioners tho... oh nope they definitely wanna bury that. Deflection at it worst.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WHERES THE HUGE PROTEST? Looks like less than 10 people. They have no signs. But they will group them with BLM. But we’re not supposed to judge America’s law enforcement by the thugs “bad apples”. America is dirty.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RemboldtRuss @ghostOfFusay @Ponygal923 @GregAbbott_TX What criminal is on a pedestal? Beside Trump. There was National coverage about that little boy you referred to. The killer was arrested immediately. It wasn’t a weeks long process to ask for the killer to be arrested. the story isn’t gonna keep making headlines like open cases<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RemboldtRuss @ghostOfFusay @Ponygal923 @GregAbbott_TX Tragic story. The killer was arrested immediately.  What about the white NYPD officer who killed his own white son? Still think these animals serve the constitution?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>💔💔💔💔 forever heartbreaking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RemboldtRuss @ghostOfFusay @Ponygal923 @GregAbbott_TX The police ARE the criminals who have taken over the streets. And the proved the other day they couldn’t catch a killer to save their lives so I think we’ll be okay without em.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ConservJean @stillgray #DefundThePolice they don’t do shit but Murder minorities anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2staralade @LadyDonnaK @atensnut We do address both. White racist should mind their business. Always talking about things they know nothing about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LadyDonnaK @2staralade @atensnut Yea the black community does have many issues. Yet the fact remains police officers are SWORN IN to PROTECT citizens and their rights and they Kill black people at a rate 3x higher. Athletes have been standing since the 60’s and until recently athletes (kaepernick) were punished<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ConservJean @stillgray *but<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ConservJean @stillgray It’s has to with systemic racism buy your basic ass wouldn’t get it. Goodbye<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ConservJean @stillgray They had witnesses in their face yelling “THIS man shot someone”and they told him keep it moving. They didn’t act at all. Exactly why we don’t need their stupid racist do nothing asses on out streets. #DefundThePolice. He turned himself in the next day. Please save it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BUrlacher54 pretty sure all those tackle has caused you serious head trauma. Get well soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rightofcentere @EnnisPeter @KellyBowman2 @chipfranklin To interpret statistics is to understand what they mean... But I guess the truth is debatable. Anywho, Is it really a battle when we’ve only seen white supremacists opening fire on crowds 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scrowder The police had their man and didn’t even bother to stop him and question him. But okay. They would have never “found” him if the people didn’t record and blast him for the world to see. P.S he turned himself in a day the next day. Ignorance is bliss tho.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ConservJean @stillgray The white boy had an illegal gun sooo....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ConservJean @stillgray Yet after the same police department got a call multiple shots were fired and multiple people were injured they let a white boy with a huge gun walk right past them. They didn’t even stop or question him. Save the fear bullshit for someone with no critical thinking skills.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LadyDonnaK @atensnut YA DONT. When did we ever have civilians involved in fake ass race wars playing out in the streets under Obama ? We didn’t. Because he didn’t demonize Latino people, and mock African Americans. Nor did he chastise women. His retoric was that of unity &amp;hope. Reading comprehension?<|endoftext|>

Idk if you haven’t noticed it not... but we don’t give a DAMN what racist white American is sick of. If you haven’t read the room lately the entire world is sick and disgusted by y’all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thefryqueen @atensnut It’s called a protest Maddie.  https://t.co/oOUGBzYCc7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FilippusB @atensnut You don’t know what he’d be. But because he’s black you assume a thug. You’re mad they’re finally standing up for their community UNAPOLOGETIC. Your comments reveal more about the hate in your heart than the NBA or King James.  He actually IS DOING GREAT 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾  https://t.co/i0i2MYPrFN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicoleTyler1976 @atensnut Tell your president to unify the country. That’s his damn job. King James is using his platform to bring awareness to the issue at hand.  https://t.co/BUfR726tmo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheLG9 @atensnut  https://t.co/ikTDV05HOm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LadyDonnaK @atensnut You’re mad they’re finally standing up for their community UNAPOLOGETIC. Your comments reveal more about the hate in your heart than the NBA or King James. Y’all should be ashamed of yourself.  https://t.co/TN5UaoWSOK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dave_janda @SassERevere @cwebbonline I don’t know who’s your lawyer but the right to remain silent can be exercised anywhere at anytime by anyone. Btw I’m pretty sure that day he was a good Samaritan and a gentleman who broke up fight... The only crime he committed on that day was being a black man in America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@omarqudrat1 How does antifa dress? I’m confused.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stillgray Might be in response to Jacob Blake?  George Floyd? Breonna Taylor? Or maybe just outright looters. We’ll never know. What we do know for sure is Kenosha PD tried to Murder Jacob Blake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>💔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. Systemic racism has the Sf Giants and LA Dodgers acting like brothers 😭😭 this is crazy ❤️❤️❤️✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾🥺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@imjdsharp @stillgray Perhaps it’s in response to what happened Jacob Blake or George Floyd which happened in their own city. Or Tamir Rice? Or Sandra Bland? Or Mario Woods? Or Oscar Grant? Or Philando Castile? No? Maybe Breonna Taylor? Or Vanessa Guillen?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>🤣🤣 must watch  https://t.co/ERBF3Emxtm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CruiteMarlene That may be true but in NO WAY does it justify shooting someone 7 times in the back with the clear intent to kill them. I’m wondering how they knew about his warrant and not  the initial fight they were called out for 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So wachu tryna do 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bucks omg 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾 I have goosebumps thank you 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SassERevere An arrest and a cold hearted attempt at murder and completely different things.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SassERevere Did I say that? My LORD reading is fundamental. I said he didn’t have to answer their question. Stop putting words in my mouth. If they wanted to “ArReST hIm” they probably would have drawn hadcuffs and not 2 guns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SassERevere Like I said. He didn’t have to talk.  https://t.co/erarDmtBl3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SassERevere @cwebbonline It’s called the 5th amendment.... the right to remain silent and not speak with authorities.. I know it’s confusing because black peoples rights are constantly violated but we do have them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why call the police when they gave the killer water and thanked him for his services. Yet again...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaesofamous ☺️💁🏾‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trip_jdg @TaniyaHenderso1 @immawinaoscar @SharikaSoal84 No your white privileged that’s got yo head up yo ass. Good day 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trip_jdg Google . Do research then come back with another invalid opinion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@immawinaoscar @trip_jdg @SharikaSoal84 Girl. They just want him to be in the wrong so bad it’s disgusting. He wasn’t crazy but even if he was he was minding his business and not breaking any laws.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trip_jdg So posting pictures as re-enactments of his death isn’t laughing at the situation. Yea go awf racist troll. #BlackLivesMetter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trip_jdg They cops were. It’s on video. And that’s where this conversation ends. Educate yourself before taking stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He didn’t commit a crime tho and having anxiety isn’t a crime bozo. They didn’t have ANY reason to prolong his stop besides they fact they were having too much fun harassing a clearly upstanding young black man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That may be but maybe if the cops  had acted as actual humans beings with a conscious and a moral compass it DEFINITELY could had been avoided. Just because you’re not a social worker doesn’t mean you have to kill someone and laugh about it. You should seek help. Seriously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joe16598899 @SharikaSoal84 And yo wig is FUCKING TERREIBLE 🤣 it actually explains a lot about you fr.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@trip_jdg @immawinaoscar @SharikaSoal84 They stopped him, terrorized him and facilitated the injection. I believe the law calls that working in concert. Shut yo ass up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jamauri just kicked my ass in uno 🤣😭 it’s his first time playing I’m teaching him 🤦🏾‍♀️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TafadzwaMadkid @FOCKINRATA If someone has already shown they will shoot you you’re probably gonna comply with commands... but okay common sense don’t make sense to everyone and that’s okay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TafadzwaMadkid @FOCKINRATA How can you run if both your feet are shot. You’re CLEARLY dumb asf. She was walking away before he shot her..... more than likely he shot her while demanding she get back in. Just say you hate women and go.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>If an " I miss you" dm is nothing then what do you think would have happened had it landed how he expected it to? Shes thirsty? for passing on a married man who approached her. ok<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Or snatch me out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@klgwood @Mediaologist He’s a legend that’s my only point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@klgwood @Mediaologist I get where you’re coming from ig. The disrespect was wack 100 saying he’s not a legend. That man was very poplar. A champion for his hometown before he died. And if people didn’t know 3 songs by him I bet they knew of him. Nobody asked who nip was after his death.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If I catch another mf talking slick about nipset hussle I’m fuckin beatin they ass<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@klgwood @Mediaologist 😂😂😂💯I’m sayin tho. Just cause not everyone can relate doesn’t take away from the man’s greatness. He was not an unknown nobody like people are trying to make him out to be. The had shit lit period. To be known on any coats is an accomplishment.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>CANT WAIT 😍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At this point idek how many jobs I have 😂😂😭😭 too many<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FINESSE 🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amen 🙏🏾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What we doin 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That part 💯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xandreaJanae You was with the nigga stop fronting 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People kill me. All I know is if I pull up... And my instructions aren't already completed with a smile. I'm letting off. 😤<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The guys are so ghetto lmaooooo 😭😭😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yall gotta learn to stop putting words in people's mouth. I said "Destiny's child" meaning WITH Beyonce. The group itself is more iconic.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Another productive week ahead🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love Snapchat it allows me to have a privately public life among my inner circle 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t feel bad for that hateful bitch 🤷🏾‍♀️ back in the day anytime a white person said nigger it meant a black person WAS KILLED. Hung, shot, burned. The thing immediately following the N-word was the DEATH of a black person(s). So THATS why that word is so triggering.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I have a crush 🤣😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What’s a half woman ? 😂<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Amen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Y’all are ridiculous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m sooo irritated rn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only thing that irritates me nowadays is when business isn’t running smoothly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ASAP_Shotty2 I can see that. Real stand up men are definitely undervalued.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DEFINITELY 💯 serious question: why don’t y’all take relationships seriously? Like when y’all finally do find a good girl and commit to her why fuck up?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ASAP_Shotty2 Lmao. It’s more so wanting someone to match our mentality. Not a lot of men can deal with women they can’t manipulate and control. Like the one who are solid mentally and will tell you to step if you fuck up even  once. 5% of it is when we get into the bratty or crybaby mode 🤷🏾‍♀️🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YALL SOME FUCKIN CLOUT CHASERS. S T F U and PRAY.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>girl. fuck you 🤣 i'm just tired of the black dad slander 2 days later<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He literally hit her ass with a belt and that’s child abuse ? He never hit her above the waist . He didn’t slam her or put his hands on her. That’s was wrong with this generation 🤦🏾‍♀️ never got y’all asses whooped<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had it been a video of her getting exposed or doing something outta pocket it would be "where's her father"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lilbeigebaby I see. thats why you still responding 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ONE TIME FOR THE BLACK DAD DOING THEIR BEST IN THIS MESSED UP WORLD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lilbeigebaby tootles - a girl who got her ass whopped every blue moon and turned out classy-ish and very successful 😇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lilbeigebaby says the same government who makes laws and applies them how and when they want. It was only outlawed a few years ago. just because it written doesn't make it right. Furthermore there a difference between child abuse and a good old fashioned ass whopping<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I STILL didn't do hella stuff even after my dad passed cause I knew he didn't play 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lilbeigebaby not all adults are ruled by primal urges believe it or not. and the main the difference is shes a child. Fully dependent on her dad who is the adult in her life. A mistake is one thing but it seems like she was pursing an active sexual relationship. She needed that. PERIOD.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the last 2 days has been my tl bashing the dad. 🤦🏾‍♀️he brought her into the world and he'll take her out. This is what active parenting looks like sometimes. She did literally the worst thing a kid can do besides getting pregnant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Clearly she has someone who wants to protect her from this early exposure. He put a stop to it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With having sex. Birth control. Regular check ups. Unintended pregnancy. Nor are they ready to handle the emotional toll of having sex. And psychology proves negative reinforcement can be effective if done quickly and the child knows why it happened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just because they’re going through Puberty doesn’t mean they “need” sex. They’re still children whose minds aren’t even close to being fully formed. They don’t have the mental capacity to think decisions through. Nor are they ready to handle the responsibilities that come along<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wondering if El Chapo needa down ass bitch 😂😩🤔🤗<|endoftext|>
