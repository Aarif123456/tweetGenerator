<|startoftext|>@HannahWalkom @RoryScottC @sianberry @MakeVotesMatter I don't know, if labour are as collaborative and about policies-not-power as you're implying(?) they wouldn't think twice about an electoral pact as outlined above.

<|startoftext|>Although you can still retweet it which does seem wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Twitter have rightly placed a mandatory statement on Trump's latest election rigging claim as #Election2020 votes are being counted. #Facebook have taken no action on an identical post. Can't say I'm surprised<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#climatechange is nowhere near over! Millions of discrete moments make a continuum, a trend; and this is just a particularly important moment within it. No matter what the result there will be more to do and no matter what, #environmental justice is possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Winning an election on 22% of the vote is totally fine. Having absolute power as a result? A total nonsense.   Politics is not sport, where crowning an overall winner is part of the enjoyment - it is life, where representation of everyone's views actually matters.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Equalities Minister @Kemibadenoch says teaching-political-ideas-as-fact is illegal, yet this very political view gained press traction nationwide.

<|startoftext|>Whereas with physical packaging you know you've been duped upon opening and can demand your money back; the opaque way data processing happens means you never really "unwrap" the product.   In actuality, the #product is you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We know GDPR in Europe has forced websites and apps to change their privacy practices.

<|startoftext|>@WhoTargetsMe Interesting, what source is this? Be great to look.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Paraphrasing: @AOC is an amazing Instagram strategist<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhoTargetsMe Alas just a finger in the wind regarding technical sophistication as opposed to quantity. I should (will!) keep looking at it with more rigour...   That said, I wonder how many of those 6 million ads were run in the final month in 2016?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(4 and last) Finally for now, both campaigns are incredibly sophisticated .. far much more than 4 years ago. This is the #FacebookElection. Worth noting spend is similar but Trump has 6x the amount of microtargeting  I encourage you to check it yourself at  https://t.co/gznKVGpCwf  https://t.co/9itru74zxN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(3) I am stunned by the amount of #politicaldonation adverts run compared to general messaging ("engagement"), mailing list sign ups ("supporter acquisition") or volunteering. Surely engagement will increase by #ElectionDay.   Biden #PoliticalAds left Trump right in pics below.  https://t.co/5A5GeM71qz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(2) Particularly interesting is #Trump uses custom targeting i.e. mailing list / website visit / app use data for over 55% of adverts tracked (and roughly 60% of spend tracked). Imagine if #Facebook prevented such targeting...  (#Biden doesn't have that data available)  https://t.co/kLraSSDdkX<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>(13/14) What to do?   üëâüèº Spread the word - retweet this thread  üëâüèº Follow the orgs and peeps tagged in the final tweet below, all involved in this area in some way and provide tons of useful resources üëâüèº Join a relevant campaign. You can DM me if you like for guidance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(12/14) The problem is, Facebook cares more about their profits than #misinformation. If you don't believe that, you can check out the medium article I recently published all about it  https://t.co/uFfhyVQ4TY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(11/14) My view - and this shouldn't be controversial - is these sorts of ads, however small the budget, should not be permitted. The ads speak with false authority; purport to be factual without backing up claims (on ad or website). They are acting against our planet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(10/14) Total expenditure in the past year has been ¬£2,500 in the UK, including during the #stophateforprofit period in July. You can go look around yourself at this link:  https://t.co/6agXSjGjQQ  (Yes I made a shortlink in their name üòÜ)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(9/14) The Charity Commission stated that "The (Foundation) website could not be regarded as a comprehensive and structured educational resource sufficient to demonstrate public benefit."   Yet this same content is now running Facebook ads under the guise of a "Science Website"ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(8/14) So... before 2014 this kind of material was circulated by the Global Warming Policy Foundation, a UK #Charity.   In 2014 the @ChtyCommission stepped in, so the Global Warming Policy FORUM was created as the "campaigning arm" of the Foundation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(7/14) In case you missed it, a strong irony running through these videos is they talk about #climatechange alarmism yet they are full of panic and anxiety-inducing terminology, background music and imagery.  I honestly find them hard to watch for that reason.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(6/14) Final video for this thread  This starts part way through. They use #covid19 as an excuse to halt green policies. It's full of so many false assertions I don't have space to list. All pretence is dropped by this video.  (Tweet 10/13 has a link to full vid &amp; other content)  https://t.co/grRZZeOaT1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(5/14) The #poverty theme is particularly galling to me, because this group was founded by #Thatcherite Nigel Lawson and funded by a number of wealthy climate sceptics.   Check out this @DeSmogUK article and other amazing research on the organisation here:  https://t.co/niyuJRgaS2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(4/14) Second video of three.  üëâüèº Fearmongering RE green jobs / policies, particularly aimed at those in #poverty üëâüèº Some casual China xenophobia  üëâüèº Classic #strawman argument using @LeoDiCaprio &amp; @princeharryh  üëâüèº More alarmist language ("green altar")  https://t.co/Siela6v0Wt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(3/14) Before we look at another, I just want to note that Facebook calls this group a "science website" on their front page. This will show up when people hover over the logo or click to learn more, so the videos will be construed by many as #science.  https://t.co/pCEsdyHWkb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(2/14) Here's one advert, in full, run by the "thinktank" in July.  üëâüèº #climatechange paired with alarm / hysteria / exaggeration / cult / irrationality üëâüèº Of course can't resist a dig at @GretaThunberg  üëâüèº Implying, without directly saying, that #fossilfuels are a net good  https://t.co/34EiJYjDPI<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I'll go one step further - Johnson is lying about #poverty. The lying isn't consistent or often believable, but it's still lying.

<|startoftext|>The first 2 adverts on Facebook's ad library for UK govt tell me three things:  1) Their messaging over #covid19 is horrible. Just horrible. 2) They're spending thousands to tell us #Brexit is going to cost loads.  3) They haven't joined #stophateforprofit (forshame!)  https://t.co/i9oFHm402s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It doesn't help that the UK govt are literally advertising on Facebook telling people to go outside.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CancelCulture. I think what people don't understand is that words and actions have consequences that do genuine physical and psychological harm to others. Being "de-platformed" for such things is kind of OK in my view. It comes down to how much you care about others' wellbeing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@1CraigMorris @JonJonesSnr Oh, I agree that it changes when people do actually get into positions of power; and that people convince themselves it hasn't changed one iota. I do think the power changes people ... or maybe it just changes the narrative; the people were always the same?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Nick Clegg claims that Facebook is just a mirror to the world, but this is, ironicially, #fakenews. Facebook actually promotes divisive content over nuance. This is a great update on #stophateforprofit, must read &gt;&gt;  https://t.co/Pullw3aJHD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobBryher Oh, I didn't realise Beyond Politics was an XR slogan. You've convinced me. Still think the title is a misleading, but is a little fairer in light of that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AJ_ratcliffe I think if the system has worked like that for generations, which it has, it's systematic. People in charge of that should be taking ownership of it or step down?  RE the food ... good point. Maybe that's what I don't like about it. Be better if they delivered it to a food bank.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sigmars_Revenge No, I wouldn't have the same argument if they had committed murder.   What you've done is taken my proposed argument to a logical, but not very rational extreme. We get nowhere doing that.  There's this thing called nuance, see. Even law enforcement itself is agreed by juries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrGreenGus You need to give words detention and maybe they'll get their act together Gus!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AJ_ratcliffe Sure but maybe systematically not allowing some people in your country to access food is worse? Black-and-white doesn't really work once you dive into an issue fully.  Not saying I agree. Just thinking it through.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobBryher Have I missed something? They aren't doing it under the banner of XR are they? Where does it actually say that or show that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sigmars_Revenge I guess that includes Amazon and Google tax avoidance, Dominic Cummings, and more. So while that's true, if it seems like some people are more immune to the law than others; why follow the social contract if others are breaking it?   Not saying I agree. Just thinking it through.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobBryher Because they're not acting on behalf of XR. It's not strictly wrong, but thought exercise, if they were all of a particular gender or race and that was called out in the title instead, would that be fair? It doesn't feel right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm a bit annoyed at the Guardian though for saying "XR activists" in the title. Quite misleading!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jessicaferrow @XRBristol @MarvinJRees @ann_cousins I have given it a brief read so far and I do like it.   I should have made my original response more specific - I'm not knocking the strategy, just a politician who hasn't written it being awarded credit for writing it, by a group who claims to be "beyond politics"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jessicaferrow @XRBristol @MarvinJRees @ann_cousins Thanks Jess, I guess I'm taking issue with the unreserved applause for the Mayor in the tweet, not that he might have written the strategy in itself.

<|startoftext|>@XRBristol @MarvinJRees @ann_cousins "Unreservedly applaud"? Are you joking? Writing a plan is one thing, but the Mayor's done almost nothing in 4 years on climate.

<|startoftext|>@BraveheartCamp I have to go back to work - nice talking &amp; I will read Heartland in more detail (honest). Consider the protein thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BraveheartCamp This is the trouble. Heartland Inst is org with ulterior motives but claim of myth is based on others having ulterior motive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BraveheartCamp Please provide your evidence to support your word "myth".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BraveheartCamp I will once again ask you - are you aware of the protein-rich capabilities of other foods - now we don't hunt 9hrs a day?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@BraveheartCamp This article points to the possibility of another #natural ice age. It doesn't counter human-made #globalwarming at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@BraveheartCamp A) CO2 is not only greenhouse gas B) I take your 1 scientist, and raise you 97% earth's scientists  http://t.co/0HNsxZlqbJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BraveheartCamp What trend? Sorry, having a dumb moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BraveheartCamp Can you read your articles 1st before sending?That article states #balance is best &amp; meat was for past evolution not future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BraveheartCamp What I am saying is your Q is irrelevant, because it can be circumvented with a diff. solution. Read above &amp; my first msg.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@06Braden I've still been sucked in by this guy, though. I'm trying to find his intelligent point - genuinely it's there somewhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BraveheartCamp Your Qs I believe are based on inherent assumptions, which I am trying to de-construct before answering.We're still on meat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BraveheartCamp Ok if it's just #protein, are you aware of the massive protein content of vegetables, pulses, nuts and grains?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BraveheartCamp In logical debate you are not allowed to revert back to a previous point just b/c you can't address later ones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BraveheartCamp Thx. Not on the topic of animal meat being essential for our brains so if you could dig that up too. I'll read these over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@BraveheartCamp Ha! If it's that choice, then the #aggressive / #negative / #energysapping / #contrarion trolls!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BraveheartCamp Slow down there. Could you point me in the direction of scientific fact for that one? I'm serious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BraveheartCamp Every production and consumption choice you make is exactly that - a choice. With underlying motives.What world do you want?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BraveheartCamp Is it necessary for the world to be so populous? And to consume so much resource-intensive meat? Think outside of the box.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@06Braden Thanks for following! Freelance writer but blog about #ethics #lifephilosophy &amp; #econ at  http://t.co/aglXE8Ru45 :-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@06Braden Heads up, this guy appears to be trolling everyone quite aggressively, perhaps we should just leave him be?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BraveheartCamp No need to be so tart. Don't you believe there's another way for food production other than this status quo?<|endoftext|>
