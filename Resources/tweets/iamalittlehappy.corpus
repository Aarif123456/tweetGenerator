<|startoftext|>@mojomnx Something tells me sowing seeds of doubt/tearing down our democracy and making alternatives facts part of daily life is just as detrimental.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mrose1965 Richard. Pryer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mojomnx I don’t hate her. There’s just not much substance there, and her Be Best platform seemed like she was trolling America. She is the picture of gluttony and greed IMO. Also a caricature-like image of the American Dream. Just kinda gross overall. I like real people. She’s fake.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Justlove3332 Never doubted ya! I have considered buying a clothes tagger for some of these basically new clothes people are donating to our homeless outreach. 🤭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How about an air-drop of 80 million pairs of aviators and 80 million strands of pearls onto Trump’s “event” he is planning during the inauguration. Or at the very least 80 million mock mail-in ballots. Make it rain reality. @MeidasTouch &amp; @ProjectLincoln, make this happen! 🕶🗳<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@memehoward @thehill Not one network should cover this. Not a single one. Cut off the oxygen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Justlove3332 Many clothing donations have to be new/tags due to Covid. If it’s things you don’t think you’ll wear you can donate them! ❤️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EunLinda Nope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Atticus59914029 Suburban families are teaching our kids tolerance and acceptance not racism and bigotry. We aren’t the ‘burbs of the 50s he remembers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillMemphis Someone make this stop. This is beyond the pale.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Justlove3332 So handsome. ❤️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LizCranwell @reginaldedward3 They are telling them their truth. We know their truth is fantasy. They do not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reginaldedward3 He has no reliable people. He only surrounds himself with people who tell him what he wants to hear. He’ll go for it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WalshFreedom No other word for him. He’s earned it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BamaStephen This is heart wrenching. I’m so sorry. 💔<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@edwards21228 Just shared it to my FB group called “Hold The Line.” We are a group of diverse folks sharing info and stories about standing up for the marginalized and oppressed. We also share a lot of #NeverTrump stuff so you know we’re good people.😬🤭<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Atticus59914029 Good Lord, @McDonalds, thanks for the holiday cheer. Now I’m reflecting on my very existence. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattklewis “Alternative conservative.” Is that like alternative facts? 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RBReich Communities have to rise up. The “haves” must start taking better care of the “have nots.” Especially Christians, who claim loving their neighbor as a central foundation to their faith.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kyle_141 @Atticus59914029 Yes. Sometimes I go to @CNN and then @FoxNews websites just to compare headlines. It’s amazing the way they each spin the same info.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RevivalArchite1 @Atticus59914029 Yes. So true We are all tribal creatures by nature. We not only want to belong, we want the group we belong to to be the *right* one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CenterLeft2020 @Atticus59914029 Shew, that’s a good word!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Atticus59914029 2/ They are grown adults. If they want to belong to a cult of “alternative facts” that’s on them. I still grieve it, though. Heavily. Because the hate, bigotry, and ignorance have horrible impacts on hearts, families, communities and the nation. God help us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Atticus59914029 1/ I also wonder how they can be reached. If they haven’t seen the truth by now I don’t think they ever will. What I do know is it’s not my job. I exhausted myself for 4 years trying to expose the fraud to people I love. I’m letting go.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This guy 🤣🤣🤣 @edwards21228<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mdnij34 This should be a hard question for a true believer. I want justice to be served to him on a tarnished silver platter.

<|startoftext|>@chipfranklin I have become (more) bold in speaking truth to lies. I have been more intentional to love the marginalized. I have realized what true patriotism looks like.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>No words. @lorilharding @BamaStephen @TheValuesVoter @Atticus59914029  https://t.co/LifqfM45q5<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Atticus59914029 Agree. As for places that remain open, MANY people are working while sick bc they have to.  Either don’t test or keep results secret. Assistance may mean they are able to stay home and avoid infecting others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bridgetteevab This is unreal. I’m so thankful he wasn’t hurt worse!!!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@edwards21228 @GOP @TheDemocrats Sorry, friend. We already lit the wood. I bet at this point Hogan would gladly keep us supplied with lighter fluid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillMemphis I am ever so sorry. God be with him and their entire family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AaronPa52518213 @donwinslow Same reason they vote for them all. The old “pro life” facade.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@fi_virginia Tin man. No heart. Leaking oil.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KathrynD32 I am so so sorry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Memers08 No bc we have enough patriots to stop this in the end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@40AcresBuilt Nope. I’m hoping it was hacked?....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@maggieKTVB7 @RexChapman @steveblog<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rebeccaballhaus National laughingstock? Try GLOBAL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BamaStephen People dropped out of college bc they were making thousands a week. There were extravagant “rewards” like trips to exotic places. Luxury “earnings.” Promises of having it all made people drunk with greed. So similar to what we are seeing, like you described. And again. So sad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BamaStephen My mom &amp; thousands more were conned into a huge pyramid scheme in the 90s. People lost a LOT of $ and even marriages crumbled. They lost their minds following this “business.” CEO went to prison in the end. The MAGA cult has always reminded me of that. It’s sad, honestly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@40AcresBuilt I know, I’m just using her words against her 😬<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Atticus59914029 The BEST thing about East TN is no bad weather and no poisonous snakes. I grew up knowing how to recognize a copperhead, cottonmouth, and rattlesnake and when to take shelter for tornadoes. Those are nightmares my children don’t have to live with LOL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Atticus59914029 Oh. Hell. Naw.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@40AcresBuilt It may not be “free,” but it could be a lot cheaper than the unending economic fallout and healthcare crisis if we don’t work to end this pandemic with “free” prevention and containment measures.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gmomthoughts @mdnij34 Correct.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mdnij34 Yes. Antibodies only last a limited amount of time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonathanCohn @joncoopertweets 1) We’ve already “let Americans decide for themselves” (many did not and STILL do not mask, wash and distance) and 250k are dead. 2) Biden said no national lockdown, but base it on regional needs. Keep up. 3) I am a RN and it’s bad out here in the real world, stay in your lane.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@reneegudeman I can’t imagine being back in acute care right now. They have got to be beyond spent and angry. It was already bad with short staffing and unrealistic expectations pre-Covid. God bless them. 😕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkSchweitzer 3/ They didn’t think there were enough of us due to their limited experience &amp; worldview. Rep friends I know believe this election is legit. They personally know a loving, legit Dem. They are ready to move on, bc they know our hearts and respect our voice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkSchweitzer 2/Also, the picture that’s been painted is a raging, rioting lunatic. They don’t realize the nice RN or pastor serving them is a Dem voter. In their mind, SURELY this nice person is a republican. So, they refuse to believe this could have been anything but rigged.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkSchweitzer 1/ One reason they wholeheartedly believe the election was rigged is bc they doesn’t associate with Dems. People naturally hate things they don’t understand, so they have few to no Dem friends. Dem fam are seen as few &amp; crazy or misled. They had no idea how many of us there are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaileeBoo5 @mdnij34 @TishJames Yep. We’ve all had to pay the piper at some point. Privilege shouldn’t keep him from having to.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SenMikeShirkey @BamaStephen @TheValuesVoter @Atticus59914029 Yes, and Bill Clinton talked about his grandkids on that tarmac. We weren’t born yesterday. Problem is @GOP always thought we were...and it’s catching up to them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JuddLegum There are over 200k troops overseas. You wanna pull them, too? Our commitment to troops abroad is there for a reason. Trump and his isolationist, America First crap can't change we need strong representation, leadership and protection around the globe. SMH.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GOPAmericanMom My house and yard is gonna look like the Griswolds!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jkempcpa I think the "silent majority" would have a much needed confidence boost wh/ could lead to less anger if we quit drawing a line between educated/non-educated. A trade IS education. I think we need to change the narrative. Also, yes, keep learning/educating. @TheValuesVoter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shar19L YES! We are doing a food and clothing drive for our homeless students and their families. We are in a high-poverty town and it is HEARTBREAKING to know many of  our students are homeless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPAmericanMom I put up a patriotic tree the day the results came in. I'll change it to Christmas after Thanksgiving. I'm with you, give me all the lights and happy available!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mdnij34 My unpopular opinion is no. We are in-person for elem. and hybrid MS/HS. We also have a full time online option. Numbers are actually quite low in our schools, but contact-tracing has many kids and staff out quarantined. If we close it would be due to an actual outbreak.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Lcmwriter100 I’m a nurse who paid back loans for grad school so it resonated with me. Luckily, I was in the position to pay them back easily. But I can name 20 nurses/teachers immediately who it impacted greatly and still does. 🙁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LauraBray__ It won’t take BUT the damage he and the GOP have done and keep doing will.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BamaStephen @NancyAFrench Texting with a dear friend now. Eight fam members positive. Mom in ICU and niece is inpatient on oxygen. Failure from the top down.

<|startoftext|>@Atticus59914029 Ours will be Turkey, ham, DRESSIN', sweet potato casserole, butter beans and rolls.

<|startoftext|>@MFilmest @brandishafer4 @msdh If a patient has heart disease, contracts Covid &amp; ends up inpatient for *Covid symptoms* it is not heart disease that led them there.

<|startoftext|>@Atticus59914029 @ShawnFranklin My hometown made national news as a hotspot of “rural white people” driving the epidemic. Churches there holding mask-less (or very few masks) services and just STUNNED when community members are in ICU or dying.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GayleRebel @ResisterSis20 Agree fully. Do you know about  @johnpavlovitz? I think you’d find his explanation of how Jesus sees us as relieving and encouraging. God bless you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ResisterSis20 @GayleRebel I’m so glad you rebuilt. Do you mind sharing if religion was their reason?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@reginaldedward3 Oh, @IvankaTrump, there were "very fine people on both sides." Move it along.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TexHellCat It was time for them to step in on a peaceful transfer of power in 2015...peacefully transferring his power right on out of the GOP primary lineup. They like it. Every ounce of it. Don't let them fool you otherwise.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mojomnx Easy. They "boycott" when their token star opens his/her mouth. This is also a great question for MAGA white athletes. Let's ask @BrettFavre who was all about black lives mattering as they blocked for him, then slapped them in the face with his gross Trump endorsement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reginaldedward3 I’ve been saying all along it will be a mind warfare civil war. We aren’t gonna see much violence from them. What we will see is generations poisoned with this ideology. Hate &amp; conspiracies being promoted &amp; proudly followed via these new alt-right platforms. That’s almost worse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FlintCruneck @reginaldedward3 He’s totally twisting the message of the tweet. Clearly says the soul of the NATION, not actual human souls like God. Geeze, lighten up and have some hope for better days.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@johnlundin Literally the fact that there has been a tweet for every single thing has kept me sane for four years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Justlove3332 @NicoletteMpls 100% accurate. Enough. Bring in whoever is supposed to come in at this moment. Bring them in NOW. We need a mutiny in the justice dept to stop this madness.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CandiMathis I’m quite the Scrooge and finally cave around the 15th and it’s down by the 27. But this year I put it up the day Biden won. It’s patriotic themed and may stay up for four solid years!!!!  https://t.co/pDZjNh1qP5<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hilaryluros Start a church. Well, that actually could happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reginaldedward3 And it's not just MAGA. I don't trust people. I have become more divisive trying to stand up for the truth. It's caused so much harm in all of us.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jkempcpa Agree. Tree normally goes up around the 15th and down around the 26th. (I’m a lil bit of a Scrooge.) This year I put one up the day Biden was declared the winner. Red, white and blue tree. 🥳❤️👏🏼🗳  https://t.co/h98HrakbrE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fi_virginia I think at this moment in time it’s Trumpism. Not any one policy. Many GOP voted straight blue due to his terrible reign and lack of GOP controlling his lies. If GOP lawmakers would find their spine and oppose demagoguery, we’d likely come back.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>As a former ICU RN I’be taken care of some really sick patients. But nothing like what RN’s are seeing with COVID. Exhausted is an understatement.

<|startoftext|>@Justlove3332 In church we say “unspoken prayer request” for someone who needs prayer but wants to remain anonymous.   So I’m gonna pull the “unspoken regret” card 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AllisonRisseeuw Front-line workers have been heroes from day one. May you remain safe and healthy. But we need you. I’m also an RN, just not in thehospital anymore. I’d gladly go back to say I was front-line. Wear it like a badge of honor bc you’re a HERO!!!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CParty2020 2/ The notion that Dems drug his wife &amp; kids through hell is ridiculous. His wife should have “mommed” better &amp; removed herself and kids from the hearing.

<|startoftext|>@CParty2020 1/ Your points are wonderful, but the nonsense about how he was treated is stale 😒. He knew full well his past would be scrutinized &amp; even attacked.

<|startoftext|>@reginaldedward3 I just saw an article on this. It wasn’t counted. If I find article again in I’ll tag you. 😕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gunderthor And Trumpism, only caring about oneself for gain of more power, took over the party. Good bye and no love lost!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Some people will believe literally anything. That’s it. That’s the tweet. #TrumpMeltdown #TrumpConcede<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TexHellCat Ok this is actually scary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicoletteMpls Same. Someone please have some damn guts. This is scary.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@reginaldedward3 For. Four. Years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mdnij34 I’ll tell you this much. The same people who refused masks will refuse it. Most anti-vaxxers are white evangelicals.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jkempcpa If MAGA vaccinates in big numbers it will be VERY telling. The only anti-vaxxers I know are far right-wing believers. Let’s see how far their blind allegiance goes....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Justlove3332 I’m glad I was home with my baby and not FaceTiming them while I was off working for Satan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fi_virginia Too many people are anti-vaxers and ironically the main one I know are conservatives. I’ll be interested to see their response to this news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@just_mindy @TheRickWilson Where is @senatemajldr now advising Trump to grow up and concede? This is just the latest of excusing the inexcusable. Where were they to hold him to task on Russian bounties? Again. Don’t play coy. The patient ran the asylum and no one handled him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@40AcresBuilt @DNC @GOP So won’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mojomnx Maybe some obits FROM the rallies would also be handy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@just_mindy @TheRickWilson Prop up a mad man. Don’t play coy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dknight10k Plenty of black people voted MAGA, which is so concerning to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@just_mindy @TheRickWilson Seeing as how the GOP Senate has fallen in lock step with Trumpism is 100% is. . .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jkempcpa We do this like we have a masters degree in it. Like it’s our job. They must not know about us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fi_virginia Two words. Term limits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fi_virginia Biden isn’t that kind of Dem. He’s a moderate which is why many GOP could support him. AOC trying to take credit for this win is laughable. Most Bernie supporters I know stayed home pouting. It was moderate and marginalized Dems and former GOP who did this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Garrett_Archer @Dlstoke I’m literally naming a dog Maricopa one day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lorilharding @MargMowczko @sandraglahn @emilynclark @ARPDeWitt @KelseyMLoo @katehanch @flemingrut @emmykegler @pastorchick70 That’s ironic. I am planning a Dec trip to south Florida....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CandiMathis I was then last night I slept so well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dlstoke And they’ll all EXHALE when he enters the room, whether they admit it or not. Negotiating with a sane person has a way of leading people to agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @benshapiro do facts now care about your feelings? @mojomnx @TheValuesVoter @Justlove3332 @LibertyBritt   Asking for the millions of votes that prove *factually* your guy lost and y’all *feeling* mad.   FACTS DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS, BEN!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Atticus59914029 @TheValuesVoter @BamaStephen @thomasmckenzie   Riddle me this. I was assured by many evangelicals they were only supporting a corrupt mad man for SCOTUS seats...sooooo, why the continued allegiance? Why the disappointment? They got their seats. 🧐<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mojomnx I saw no fraud in my English Lit class where I received an A, but I’d like a recount of Chemistry where I barely pulled off a D, please. And FWIW I claim for electoral purposes I made an A in Chemistry, anyway. So there.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ExgopRachel 100% should be. And AOC throwing us all and @ProjectLincoln under the bus...shameful. We won this for you, sis. Take a seat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dlstoke Oh a fave. Yassssssss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ExgopRachel He absolutely wouldn’t have won without all of us who flipped blue and flipped others blue. We can survive without a “thank you,” but may not have survived Trump. I’ll take it as a win! 👏🏼<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Stonekettle As my daddy says when Ole Miss loses...hate it for em.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jkempcpa If it weren’t for the hope and fight @ProjectLincoln brought in full force, many of us resistors would have had less strength to keep fighting.

<|startoftext|>@MarkSchweitzer Fumigation. @SpeakerPelosi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamSchiavone @reginaldedward3 @RepSherrill @ProjectLincoln “Go away” is hyperbole.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Redistrict Ooooooooh 👏🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamSchiavone @reginaldedward3 @RepSherrill She needs to simmer down or go away. How many people clung to @ProjectLincoln to get them through our final year of resisting?! We held the line while you brought more division to the Dem party. Basically what I’m telling you is...ex-GOP resisters are better at this than you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC Wake up. The @ProjectLincoln did the grunt work. You’d have another four years of Trump if not for them. Grow up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fred_guttenberg @senatemajldr Time to go to work in GA, resistors!!!!! @MSDmomforchange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@secupp How do they feel about NOT stepping up and intervening with this sad, desperate, lying man who’s unraveling before the world’s eyes and attempting to take our country down with him!?! Looking at you @GOP leadership. It’s time.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kurteichenwald @ProjectLincoln 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NikWotherspoon No. You ain’t wrong. If anything this election showed us we don’t have an extreme electorate. No landslide on either side. Most of us are moderates who lean left or right.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Justlove3332 Age!?! Really?! SHE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jkempcpa What’s rich is media people pretending they are just now seeing the crazy and are just SO appalled. You’ve seen it. You enabled it. They will ALL do this to save their hides. You knew, quit acting like you didn’t.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Justlove3332 Age couldn’t meet the moment. What was there to lose that is worse than what she lost NOT voting Biden? Holding out hope for that GOP run I guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@56blackcat @Isellmpls I never doubted. Not once.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@56blackcat @Isellmpls This is NOT ok. Why is this allowed?! I mean he’s toast. All his little minions can turn on him now and handle this!!! LOOKIN AT YOU @tedcruz @marcorubio @senatemajldr @LindseyGrahamSC @attorneygeneral<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NumbersMuncher My mom was in a HUGE pyramid scheme once. It had a good run. People made a LOT of money. A. LOT. The “CEO” ended up in federal prison. SEC got his ass and all his cronies. Nothing fake lasts forever. No amount of lies and fraud can stand. In the end the piper will be paid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WajahatAli Their true base is left-leaning moderates. That is what won this. Left-leaning moderates of all races, cultures and religions are the base.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@wyntermitchell I see your point. I just don't wanna throw the baby out with the bathwater. I do feel like I've learned a lot from him, and seen him angry and impassioned against Trumpism. But I feel you and LOVE following you on here!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NateSilver538 @dens1984 I HOPE IT'S FOX NEWS!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wyntermitchell Is it due to his work with Trump admin? I love him. He taught me the meaning of "white-washed history" and spurred me to re-learn and teach my kids better than what I was taught.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CandiMathis I. Know. Right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CandiMathis Ummmmmmm it’s razor thin and I think Trump will win by a couple thousand. It doesn’t matter. We don’t need it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicoletteMpls We’ve seen him like this for 4 years. No one has done shit. It’s unreal. Where the hell is Bible verse @marcorubio<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicoletteMpls I agree. Why was that allowed!?!? I kept waiting for someone to come tackle him down, give him a shot of Haldol and straight-jacket him. It was sad for the country and for him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jkempcpa Agree. That was some third world country shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Atticus59914029 Let the GOP burn too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stuartpstevens They’ve all been “concerned.” Burn it down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why isn’t someone stopping this?! This is so sad. #TrumpMeltdown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UWMoose @Acosta 🤣 I’m quite sure @tedcruz @marcorubio @LindseyGrahamSC and @senatemajldr will enable and allow it somehow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jkempcpa Charter. Members. 🙌🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Atticus59914029 This is insane. I voted for Clinton, Bush, Bush, McCain, Romney, Cruz in primary then....Clinton😯 I am a LEGIT charter member Never Trumper lol.

<|startoftext|>@fi_virginia As my girl @GlennonDoyle says...”We can do hard things!” I got a print of this quote when kids went into lockdown online school. It is more for mama, trust me. 😕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChidiNwatu @Acosta Neither. He wildin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Atticus59914029 My middle kid just came to the porch where I’m hiding with music and a cocktail and said, “Trump’s speaks at 6:30.” First, who are these kids?! The damn magic wall has entranced them. Two, WHO. CARES. Start packing. #ByeDon<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@brianklaas Correct. The GOP will one day end up being the third party. This is what happens when you refuse to evolve and transform with the time and heart of the nation. True conservatives will HOPEFULLY wake up and form their own. What should they name it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ret_cw3 @mdnij34 My sweet 9 year old totally did the math in his head. I was so proud, b/c he did NOT get that from his mama LOL<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Time4ChangeNov @David__Tibbs @crampell @MaxBoot Narcissism is a hard thing to shake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why are they allowing Trump to make these meritless claims for lawsuits. Never mind. Why have they allowed any of him? @Atticus59914029 @Dlstoke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Atticus59914029 All paths lead to self with a narcissist. Period. I have dealt personally with enough to know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jkempcpa Progressives, you NEED those who will use their privilege to speak to power on your side. Trust me. The youth, Hispanic and black community needs us. They have said it themselves. Don’t cut off your noses to spite your face. Unify. We are ready. Are you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveDeaceShow Wow. And incite some violence maybe?! This guy....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HKrassenstein They always have. This new Conservative movement wants to have their cake and eat it, too. Believers have led the path. God forgive us.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MeghanMcCain This has zero to do with Dem “repelling,” their messaging, strategy or heart. This has 100% to do with the fact that half the country thinks it was cool for your dad to be bullied and demeaned. Many of us flipped on behalf of your dad. We are sorry you didn’t. @Dlstoke<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Dlstoke Greed and self-absorption happened. I’ve never seen so many Americans I know of all ages so self-absorbed and willfully blind to others’ needs. Ignorance of real patriotism, putting the whole before oneself, happened. People suck. That’s what happened. Gutted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fi_virginia Agree. Don’t half the process and make us have another Bush/Gore debacle.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheValuesVoter You’ve been quiet. I’m glad to hear your optimism. 🥰 I agree. And while the moral defeat of it being so close is gut-wrenching...the fact that good wins is very encouraging. As Luke said about Darth Vadar, so I say about America, “There is still good in her.” #Resistance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lcmwriter100 @GOPAmericanMom @cindymccain It’s not time to worry. @Atticus59914029<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WotanTX @txsguy09 @Dlstoke I never did. Even when I was GOP he didn’t have my ear. Gross.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Justlove3332 Same. Watch @GlennonDoyle morning hello. She nails it. Basically “I am hopeful Joe wins. But this is a disgusting moral defeat for America.” The difference wouldn’t be evident for me either. But I would never exhale knowing my country is led by vile corruption.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reginaldedward3 It's ok to live an overly hopeful life. xo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Justlove3332 PITY party I should say lol.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@reginaldedward3 My home state denounced the confederate flag handily. HANDILY. And look at Arizona! McCain👊🏽. I’m happy today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THIS is the story of the election. Half of America voted for corruption. And they think the other half voted for corruption. How do we move forward from here? God longs for reconciliation. Only He can bring it in this mess. @BamaStephen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CreativeSubName @FormerlyCBM Many people feel we didn’t have a good choice either way. I get that.

<|startoftext|>@Wilsonrjs @MalyndaHale I only inquire bc if you are from a heavy red state it’s hard to look many people in the eye, quite frankly. The love of power overwhelmed the love of fellow man is what happened. Over generations we’ve become more self-serving &amp; greedy. This travesty is ultimate proof of that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CandiMathis Shew girl why didn’t I go to bed at 10 I knew results wouldn’t be in.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DannyZuker @CheriJacobus Is he speaking yet? Can't find.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MalyndaHale I'm so deflated. I really thought there were more good people than bad. I really thought when people saw evil they would know it and reject it. I'm a dreamer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RUTHNCOLEE @CandiMathis I don't either. I told her I'm sorry but if you can't tell the difference between Joe Biden and Fidel Castor, you may fall into Trump's low educated crowd he loves so much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Justlove3332 A serious and decent people would have laid down the hammer on this clown. I'm very disappointed. More than 2016 b/c we KNOW now how dangerous he is. Joe can still win, but a landslide is what good people would have done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reneegudeman 100% accurate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CandiMathis I lived in South Florida and a friend still there said Cubans are terrified when they hear the word socialism. I'm with you it's bizarre.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@matthaig1 And their reality is based on their life experiences.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FormerlyCBM What I'm NOT missing is that people of faith are willing to trade in honor for corruption as long as it means they remain in power. What I'm NOT missing is people are willing to vote a man into the office of POTUS they wouldn't allow to teach their child PE.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lmitterm @TheValuesVoter @DavidAFrench I embrace friends and family who believe that. Ones who have educated themselves not just loved the fervor. It’s the ones who say bigoted and hateful things like “he’s gonna make sure blacks don’t takeover the suburbs” I won’t tolerate. The good news is God’s got this either way.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lmitterm @TheValuesVoter @DavidAFrench I have been told by plenty of Trump supporters I am going to hell for voting Democratic. That’s not ok and I have NEVER crossed that line. Not once. THAT is against scripture.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lmitterm @TheValuesVoter @DavidAFrench I don’t split hairs on semantics. Of course I wouldn’t hold it against them in that manner. But it baffles me when reasoning is based on falsehoods. Falsehood I personally reject. Being baffled is not out of line with scripture. Even being confused or hurt by it isn’t.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MeidasTouch One of 3 things happened to all the primary candidates. One, they were frauds from the start. (Likely.)

<|startoftext|>@EvangelicalRes1 Little to no televised news. Listen to @jaketapper in carline for about 20 min. Private FB page of like-minded voters and friends.

<|startoftext|>@CandiMathis I was overly optimistic in 2016. So I’m kinda shaky. Especially driving rural roads of TN and seeing so many MAGA flags. Of course on poor looking properties which is so heartbreaking.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Dlstoke Baaaaaaaad gamble, bruh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reginaldedward3 They bring the thunder. More legal power and brains than @realDonaldTrump. It has to make him insane that the king of lawsuits is outplayed time and time again. And by the very organization fighting to vote him out. Delicious. @ProjectLincoln<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jkempcpa Agree. You don’t sound crazy this is accurate. MLK represented the humble and wise downtrodden. Trump represents the proud ignorant downtrodden. It’s a totally legit parallel.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@politvidchannel No, honey. It was the GOP you pissed off and we’re voting you all out. 👋🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BamaStephen Investments are risky. We have investments which often backfire, but normally pay off. Some investments are clearly too risky to take on at all. You don’t even entertain them. The @GOP was too dumb to know the difference.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NateT_ @nat_taylor @baseballcrank @ProjectLincoln Also, for the record #NeverTrump didn’t begin after his election. We were here w/ men like @tedcruz @LindseyGrahamSC and others who were calling him unfit and worse. It WAS an effort against the leader. When the party cowered it showed we had to widen the scope to the entire @GOP<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GOPAmericanMom It is so delicious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reginaldedward3 The 2nd issue I have is had this been an infant with dad (and I’ve seen some beautiful intimate pics of men with newborns) it would be 100% championed. Want to take it real deep? This speaks to the pro-life hypocrisy. Love babies, then reject them when they don’t turn out perfect<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reginaldedward3 The biggest problem that I see in the ‘fallout’ is had this been a mother and her child, it would be 100% championed. So what does this say about the majority of Americans? That they reject a masculinity that can and should include compassion through touch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jkempcpa 🆘 @MountSinaiNYC #CenterForPostCovidCare Leaving many Americans with long-term, mysterious, difficult to diagnose and treat chronic symptoms from #COVID19 with no where to turn.

<|startoftext|>@FormerlyCBM Exactly. If Trump think a 90 min attack on Hunter tonight will sway any last min voters he has lost his mind (some more). It will make his base happy happy happy and others roll their eyes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jkempcpa Speak the truth and shame the devil!!!! 🔥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The dude yelling “JESUS SAVES” with a mic at the Dem rejection of ACB is irony at its finest. 1-Many of the Congress men &amp; women are practicing Christians, or faithful to other religions. 2-If only Jesus saves, why is the “Christian” so adamant SCOTUS saves?@TheValuesVoter<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Atticus59914029 Because many Americans are obsessed with limitless freedoms, horrible at self-control, introspection and won’t educate themselves properly it will take regulations, which the right will scream about.

<|startoftext|>@jkempcpa  https://t.co/0puKmMBB0u<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CandiMathis I used to pick a soft one and MawMaw would send me back for a legit switch. She never once used it. Just laid it on the counter for me to see all day. I knew. Oh, I knew. 🤣😅<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheValuesVoter To me his attack on the DOJ agencies is the #1 reason he must go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MalyndaHale Oh girl. 👀 you in for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CandiMathis I was expecting him to tell Donald to go “pick a switch” and tear that butt UP!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheValuesVoter 🔥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I did a thing. Get out and vote. And vote responsibly. And also...BLUE 😬 #BuildBackBetter #vote   @steveblog  @TheValuesVoter @Atticus59914029  @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris    https://t.co/haztPifUUW<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sbturner019 @NateBell4AR @Atticus59914029 Being labeled the neighborhoods crazy liberal just bc you oppose Trump is like a badge of honor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NateBell4AR @Atticus59914029 Worth. It.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Atticus59914029 It means being told by fam and friends you’re going to hell for not voting red. I actually did a zoom call with a yankee progressive GOTV guy who wanted to know what it’s like to oppose trump in a deep red area. He was FASCINATED bc he’s surrounded by Dems.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@reneegudeman The church will blame liberals like they always have. They’ll never self-reflect and admit that the hypocrisy from within is what actually drove people away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reneegudeman 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reginaldedward3 Yes. That’s why when people say “Fine, hate Trump but why would you wanna flip the senate? You hate the party if you vote all Dem.” So, keep his enablers?! Nah, I’m good. I know what I know. Also, so what if I now hate the party? It’s devolved into a bunch of whiney babies. 👶🏻<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@joncoopertweets @Atticus59914029 To quote you I’m just “spit ballin” here. I’m gonna say this is a hoax story and if not a hoax MOST DEFINITELY is illegal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reginaldedward3 Same. And I’ve lost friends’ “respect” for it. Sorry, I see what I see. And I don’t accept corruption in leadership. No matter the promises made. No matter what’s in it for me if I follow along. Corrupt is corrupt. It should be rejected. Period.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>He means Hunter, but sentiment is the same. Stop the addict shaming. Stop it.   #Hunter #EndTheStigma<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mdnij34 None. I don’t follow them closely. Most of them don’t live in our worlds. The ones I respect are ones I’ve seen walk out compassion for their fellow man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fi_virginia My friend’s breast biopsy was delayed. Then when it was finally done she was rushed to top surgeons for treatment.

<|startoftext|>@LibertyBritt 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 there needs to be National effort to rename this movement to “anti abortion.” That’s what it is. Some of the same friends who tell me they vote Trump bc they are “pro life” also send kids to private schools to stay away from the blacks and the poors. Speaks volumes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jkempcpa Where did this data even come from? I have friends abroad who say we are the laughing stock right now and people and hoping he is GONE soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DannyTempleton9 Tell them if RvW hasn’t been overturned by now it ain’t happening. Also social programs the Dems support lead to less abortions. Other countries with harsh abortion laws don’t see less rates.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ida_skibenes @kirstiealley @realDonaldTrump In every aspect of the term. I wish people would quit using he’s an “outsider.” So 2016.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan @kirstiealley @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/q3PwkY0tQt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kirstiealley @realDonaldTrump This civil unrest will never lead to a true stable economy. There are deeper issues at play here. And worse, no fit leader to heal deep hurts. A booming economy is great, but not at a cost of “using people and loving things instead of loving people and using things.” @mmpadellan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mdnij34 Not a chance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmosofJudah1 @LibertyBritt False theology at the highest level. God so loved the WORLD. Not just America. So sad it’s come to this worship of a country and it’s leaders.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mojomnx A second Age of Enlightenment?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LibertyBritt I’ve been saying for years, patriotism &amp; county have become idols. I love Lennon, “Imagine there’s no countries, nothing to live or die for.” Jesus didn’t ask us to die for anything, except self. This has become such an obvious idol &amp; I don’t know why people refuse to see it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattklewis We have some super wusses in DC. Let me up there. I’ll be wildin’ all over the place. No filter. There would be no “quiet opposition”. It’s not in my DNA.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Justlove3332 @JoeBiden You precious soul. Any attack on people with addiction is evil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Atticus59914029 Sunday School is obviously not doing the trick. VBS either. We need to burn down many church programs and build them back up on rock not sand. Because if you can’t see this as eerie and blasphemous, clearly there is widespread false teaching deep within the body.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Olivianuzzi Oh crap I bet @Starbucks isn’t even gonna have a Merry Christmas cup too!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LibertyBritt The awakening to the attack on my faith came way before the attack on politics. Politics doesn’t damage people eternally. False spiritual teaching does. The damage evangelicals have done, tricking people to believe &amp; follow false teaching is much worse than political damage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Atticus59914029 I like to keep super crucial things private, too. Things that may hurt millions of people. I mean, whose business is that anyway?! Let me do me, man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@just_mindy @fi_virginia I often wonder if ppl of faith need to ditch politics, return fully to God’s original party: the Church. (Whatever faith you practice) I know ppl of faith can do good via policy, but we’re at a place where even the most faithful are on board with division. I’m guilty.👎🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@just_mindy I am SO sorry. And you’re right that’s not right. I didn’t have room to add to last tweet, I believe you have a firefighter son who has prob responded to one too many ODs<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@just_mindy If the other side did it, I would also call it out. We have an epidemic of drug OD. This is no time to play on a recovered addict, regardless of political fervor it gains. I say this apart from ANY pol leaning bc my heart breaks for families who’ve buried their kids who’ve OD’d<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mojomnx It’s been sad sad sad to watch. Will expertise and truth ever be followed and right again?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fi_virginia I believe a reconciliation effort is needed. But not for anything political as he says. For the spiritual battle we all have been facing and will continue to face. For things spoken in anger, when we were meaning to share our beliefs and hearts. @just_mindy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fi_virginia We will be there soon! Ours is limiting capacity now. Few littles going; mine wanna see their friends. I know that felt amazing!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HoneycuttChris @lorilharding @sinner_sainted @chuckdegroat @Acts29 Deaf. Ears. I went to a pastor once (with backup from an elder deacon) that non-biblical teaching was being taught in the church from said pastor. Deaf. Ears. And worse, many pastors are borderline narcissist which means you are led to feel like you’re crazy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2/ Apologize where you’ve lashed out. Understand those who’ve lashed out against you may NEVER do the same. That’s ok. Cling to things that last. Know WHY we resist.

<|startoftext|>@reneegudeman @jkempcpa I wish I could find the clip. She said on the record that replacements should be a “lateral move.” Lib for lib. Cons for cons. Her taking this nom at this point is spitting in the face of her original correct stance.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheValuesVoter No. It isn’t. But some services provided at some clinics are. Like paps to find HPV/cervical cancer. I say shut down the mills. Now.

<|startoftext|>@fi_virginia Trump said it was but I keep getting stuff on time also.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, we all know MAGA will pull out all the stops to excuse and defend Trump. I just ran up against the “kids in cages was Obama’s fault.” Noted.

<|startoftext|>@TheValuesVoter Yes. Here we go again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheValuesVoter Many define it perfectly.  But don’t see the irony that the movement is dead after being misrepresented for so long. So they support and vote for a fairy tale...a story of old.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@reginaldedward3 Jeffries &amp; church leaders like him are why people (particularly young demographic) are rejecting Christianity in droves.

<|startoftext|>I’m so confused. “Court packing” in the literal sense is adding seats. But isn’t “court packing” also making sure the court is “packed” with your party’s leaning?! Packing it to ensure your side is heavily represented?! #SCOTUS @TheValuesVoter @HuffHanna<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jeremy_hugh @BITS336 @IwanLab @donwinslow It is. Which is why you see so many different veins being named. I’ve seen a regular IV in the jugular vein before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shar19L @fi_virginia This. I see your point on the media running away with it but this isn’t a time to hide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BITS336 @donwinslow Also the darn IV won’t stop beeping if you do AC. Trust me. It’s annoyingly and makes the patient nervous that something is wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@narceducator @mcuban Also, as a person of faith I’ll add anyone putting a country or its symbols before goodness, decency and truth has made those things into idols.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fi_virginia @marcorubio Enemies? Citizens are enemies? We deserve to know. Even former pres Bush had updates frequently on his declining age and health. We can’t have it both ways. What’s fair for one is fair for all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two things can be true at once.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fi_virginia @marcorubio called for 100% transparency. Both sides want the WH to speak as much as possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bookkeepPLUS @Justlove3332 No time for political correctness. I mean isn’t that what he instructed us to do?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JJComfortDog @donwinslow I am not defending it. Trust me. I was answering what it looked like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@just_mindy @TheValuesVoter @Atticus59914029 Thanks this clarifies it. I knew I could count on you!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a ? for people who were more skilled in political science than I am. Why can the president write an EO for a Muslim ban but not an EO for a relief stimulus during a national pandemic? I’m earnestly asking this. @just_mindy @TheValuesVoter @Atticus59914029<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ProjectLincoln @harrisonjaime Already do. And donated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@richard680news @donwinslow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pastormarkburns @realDonaldTrump Absolutely. JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER HUMAN ON THE PLANET. That’s what a virus does. My LORD you people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid How many licks does it take to get to the center of a tootsie roll tootsie pop. The world may never know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BITS336 @donwinslow I stay away from the AC if at all possible. Or maybe he’s in a bunker somewhere and it’s all BS. I put nothing past him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ursomoneyhoney @donwinslow Makes you wonder. Like someone said why didn’t he have a mask on if he’s positive. @marcorubio said conspiracy theories are flying due to lack of transparency from the WH on this. When have they EVER been truthful and transparent? That’s why we are all having these questions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ursomoneyhoney @BITS336 @donwinslow Could have been not on hand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BITS336 @donwinslow Right, the needle isn’t removed. It’s clamped off. For all we know it’s in his AC (inside elbow) hidden under clothes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnpavlovitz Speaking with a friend in Kenya this week. He said everyone is laughing at us. He lived here briefly, but went back. Smart man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BITS336 @donwinslow I’ll tell you what he DIDN’T have was his makeup team. Which makes me think they couldn’t come in. That is hopeful, bc I’m shocked he didn’t demand it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmerIndivis @donwinslow Great point friend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BITS336 @donwinslow It can be disconnected &amp; for lack of better explanation clamped off. When I have to take a patient to X-ray for instance you detach the actual drip and “hep lock” it. That is, it has a valve on the IV (where the cannula enters the vein) where you can attach and detach the IV line<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdeleScalia Yes. So I gladly enable them and do it myself for my own sanity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fi_virginia It is, but Fox would be doing the same on Biden. Both media sides suck. Boooo!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My love towards this human is large. So happy for her, and even more happy for the people she will speak life to. Congrats to a woman who can SO DO THIS!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donwinslow Looked like a hospital floor conference room. I’ve been in one dozens of times to conference with a family on prognosis etc. Most floors have one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CandiMathis And I have no idea what that means. File it under weird crap people in Mississippi say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CandiMathis He beat him like a red headed stepchild, girl. Like a DRUM. @harrisonjaime<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This is so embarrassing. Do you think people in other countries (who have handled Covid better) are having watch parties of this nonsense? I would if I were them. 🍺 #Shameful #TrumpHasCovid @Dknight10k<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@onesarahjones Couldn’t have a proper funeral and burial for my grandmother. (Didn’t die of covid, to be clear)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@onesarahjones 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donwinslow @Yahoo Nice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan And the family showed up late to the debate according to #ChrisWallace and therefore weren’t tested.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Agree 100%. Or had the same rapid testing the govt and professional sports teams had access to. #TrumpHasCovid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeidasTouch Well other than that time a Pres once owed 400mill to an unknown source.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@votevets You don’t say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HeathMayo Thank. You.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2 things are true. It is NOT@ok to want someone dead no matter how foul they are. It is ENTIRELY fair game to scrutinize people who put themselves &amp; others in harms way. Clutch your pearls elsewhere. This will be a case study for med students one day. #TrumpHasCovid<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheRickWilson Yes. And the pearl clutching from the right to every one of saying this needs to stop. You play with fire you get burned. It’s grade school cause and effect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reneegudeman Imma have to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrislhayes For his people to the the BEST PEOPLE why do they misspeak so much?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@secupp I mean, people are yelling at me for posting anything other than “thoughts and prayers” but this is literally a textbook case study to use of why you follow the the science and guidelines. No matter who you are.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Millions of Americans slept in ERs awaiting a room. And not for “precautionary measures.” So tell me again how there’s no such thing as privilege. Pub-lease. Also, get well soon @GovChristie. @AngrierWHStaff @MeidasTouch @ProjectLincoln<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BamaStephen W. O. W.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump just said therapeutics are “miracles.” Dear lunatics who claim no one should take meds, bc that means your faith isn’t strong enough please hear this truth. Medication is like a miracle sent from God via his vessels. #TrumpHasCovid #MedicineMiracles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bithits @just_mindy As do I. But, to clutch pearls over libs (no lib leaders to be clear, not that I have seen) taking advantage of this HORRIBLE situation is truly not seeing the fault on both sides.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MilesTaylorUSA @WhiteHouse cc @marcorubio 🆘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheValuesVoter @jacobkschneider @realDonaldTrump It would be funny if it wasn’t so dangerous. Just like him and his administration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mayaharris_ I. K. R.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@southpaw_GA @MarshaBlackburn @realDonaldTrump I just want him, for once in his entire life, to be faced with something he can’t manipulate his way out of. We all have and he’s due.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bithits @just_mindy Ya got me. That makes it totally ok to say they hoped she would die. 🤦🏻‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@just_mindy We had to watch one of the Antichrist coming. Religion man. It’ll mess you up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Justlove3332 Are. You. Kidding. Me. Right. Now. Perhaps why family didn’t arrive in time to test per #chriswallace ? Not surprised one iota.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@just_mindy While these are abhorrent and ignorant, let’s keep in mind Hillary and her pneumonia. MAGA ate it up. Horrible things said.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Dknight10k  https://t.co/hrbsz1kwJV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While the right demands all respect and pray for the president during this time, and trust me I’m praying. I can’t help but recall  @HillaryClinton and the pneumonia episode they all stopped and prayed for. Wait they did pray for her, right?! #TrumpHasCovid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProjectLincoln Biden and campaign took every precaution and was mocked in a debate for it. Fair is fair. You don’t play by the rules, you don’t get to demand privilege.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BamaStephen Hmmmmmmm lemme think about this. Nope. Y’all did just fine OBVIOUSLY.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Justlove3332 @marjikk I remember my friend’s mom who’s dead now. Cause@of death: Dem Hoax. So if he has to have a little suffering to FINALLY have a tiny taste of what it’s like to be an actual human...I’m down. Pain and suffering have affected me positively before. Maybe it will open his eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Justlove3332 And I’m sitting here like “has he convinced the federal govt to help him fake his own death to avoid the wrath that awaits him?” 🧐 MAGA got me thinking I’m conspiracies like them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Honestly, he kinda deserves all of this. I pray they’re ok in the end. But he’s made himself a target for no one to sympathize for. I mean “it is what it is” as he says. @AngrierWHStaff<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BamaStephen “Pray.” Hey @Twitter it’s been a long year. An edit button would be a nice bone to throw us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BamaStephen I prayed. My middle child and I just prayed. Not only did we pay for him and Melania’s safety we earnestly pray that this experience will humble him and open his eyes to the reality of science. I had a similar experience and that’s what he did for me<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rickwtyler @ememwilson123 @collhistgarden In 30 years you’ve never faced Trump/Trumpism either. Just sayin.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@fi_virginia @SenatorTimScott If that man asked for forgiveness for his many grievances against this nation and citizens he’s demeaned and was sincere and showed true repentance I would 100% applaud that. But he won’t. Because the Spirit of Christ isn’t in him. You will know them by their fruits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fi_virginia @SenatorTimScott His own party says he should demonstrably denounce them. But he pushes away advice. No man is an island!! Humans are far too flawed to be left to their own mind without wisdom being poured into them. Good leaders heed advice.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rickwtyler @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump Agree. Biden should blast live speeches. Ads on promises Trump didn’t keep. Ads on how losing SS will affect boomers and elderly. 2016 is a long time ago, remind people about defaming disabled, vets, women, immigrants. Blast all his buds who got arrested and convicted. Etc. 🔥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheValuesVoter Not sure, but it was definitely an order from their commander.  https://t.co/zvrWft1VjD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Justlove3332 Same. His silence to support Trump speaks volumes, tho. Unfortunately even if he does endorse it won’t make much of an impact. He’ll be labeled a RINO and written off as McCain was. I know MAGA people who literally claim they regret voting for McCain now. It. Is. A. Cult.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@just_mindy @GOP My point was this is “give every kid a trophy” stuff. You don’t get rewarded for what you are SUPPOSED to do. I thought that was a liberal value. No idea where riot and looting fits in to family bonding. Neither side has the high ground on that anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@just_mindy @GOP You find families getting along reprehensible?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bethanyshondark So yes. You’re 100% right. Word salads are concerning. Because it would lead one to suspect a temporal lobe injury upon neurological assessment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bethanyshondark I agree. But why won’t he put it to rest and denounce white supremacy? Not in this moment, in many other moments? Other misspeaks? Also, “word salad” is an medical term we neuro nurses and doctors use for a specific aphasia due to a brain injury involving the temporal lobe.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TexHellCat I tweeted the exact same thing. Racist who have hated me my whole life back home for my vocal stand against bigotry and racism and homophobia could now target my family or me due to the call to arms against anyone not supporting him. This is not ok.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@just_mindy If we can’t say Trump isn’t a Christian because “we don’t know his his heart” we should also give the same grace to Biden. 😇<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CandiMathis The fact that it won’t sway one single voter is why I can’t look. Nothing Matters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fi_virginia Precious!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nopinacoladas @TheValuesVoter @limolady311 🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m not anti-#ACB. I am anti-inconsistency. The @GOP &amp; she said no seat filled in election yr. She said when filling a seat, a lateral move was nec. to keep balance. If she’s qualified, she’s qualified. That isn’t my issue. I’m just SICK of the inconsistency. Sick of it. #SCOTUS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RadioFreeTom I follow you for pressers and don’t even watch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RadioFreeTom @MSDmomforchange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WalshFreedom He also isn’t that smart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Atticus59914029 @jkempcpa Then what happens if a woman has to cross state lines and that’s illegal by that state’s law?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ACB said seats should be replaced as a “lateral move.” Lib for lib, con for con. Why the change of heart? @TheValuesVoter @Atticus59914029 Also why are people cheering for this when they would reject a lib stacked bench? Oh. #consistencyisdead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reneegudeman<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fi_virginia But I think we can agree this is a different opinion of the GOP than in 2016. Also 8 months is different than 1 month.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone should have to go thru nsg school where the foundational precept is critical thinking. “Critical thinking” is on a loop for every decision made for 2 years. If you leave nsg school w/o learning how to think critically you weren’t paying attention. Think. Critically.💪🏽#RN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not an unfair question. #ACB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthewjdowd Lowe’s.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Atticus59914029 Same. I lean towards point one, which is why a “stacked court” of either side is frightening. Even ACB has said in the past a should replace lib for lib and con for con to remain balanced since it has assumed an outsized role.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Atticus59914029 @EyeOnUtah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JemisonJaclyn Taking a moment to lift you up now to the One who can give you strong to endure such pain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaxGigandet Revealing he’s a charlatan and never was a Christian.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@just_mindy My only concern is which religious beliefs WILL be encroached? Like the Muslim ban. I have friends of faiths other than Christianity who are fearful. I am of the mind that we are a nation under God but the FF didn’t define that as Christianity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The irony of Trump followers claiming he is a unique person is...he’s a dime a dozen!! There are crooked, narcissist charlatans like him from coast to coast. The unique man is the one with character, decency, humility and honor. @secupp @TheValuesVoter @Atticus59914029 @JoeBiden<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@just_mindy Gotcha.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@just_mindy Serious question. Why isn’t being jolted far right concerning? This nom said we should replace seats with a “lateral move.” Lib for lib, con for con.I think she’s qualified I just think it’s a double standard when we accept a heavy right bench but not the left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevinMKruse Writing an op-ed want a copy? 😬<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jcrsaltman @mattklewis 🤭🤭🤭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fi_virginia Devil’s advocate here😬🤣we all know the POTUS himself, whether dem or gop doesn’t actually make the list. It’s presented to him by advisors. That being said he has stuck to conservatives. How else would be he re-elected?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Justlove3332 Sweet mama so much  love to you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EyeOnUtah Eternal things like loving my neighbor will last always. I reject him, period. If it comes to pass that Biden isn’t better than so be it. But I won’t cower to “better policies” for the very soul of my fellow man. Nope. Been this way since I was a kid and ain’t gonna change 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EyeOnUtah No policy decision is worth losing integrity over. No tax cut. No trade deal. No SCOTUS seat. Nothing is worth trading in my faith and core values for. America and the world are temporal. They will burn away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EyeOnUtah I don’t like ugly memes at all, but this is it in a nutshell. What was wrong for Dems is now ok for gop. My voting: Bush. Bush. McCain. Romney. I’m not a left wing nut job. I am an ex-GOP like thousands of others who will possibly return when Trumpism is gone.  https://t.co/3YAQDVLavv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@birdsarebeauti1 @MeidasTouch Woman.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrJeffSargent @marciesilvers1 @MollyJongFast Agree. Trumpism has taken over. All who followed must go. Burn it down and restart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EyeOnUtah “Whataboutism” is rampant in the conservative community. this used to be a left wing idiotic ploy. But I see a LOTA from gop now of “well the dems did this or that, now it’s our turn”. this is why many have left the gop. Fed up with the inconsistency.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EyeOnUtah I agree. And I applaud Kav and Gorsuch for their originalism and saying precedent is precedent, proving no matter what the political leaning they will act towards justice. I still haven’t heard you admit Trump also wants the courts to do the work of Congress.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EddieBritt I realize it’s a matter of semantics, but “religion” has never saved a thing. Love ya! 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EddieBritt Negative. Jesus will save our world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EyeOnUtah Also food for thought. If it’s only the Dems who use courts instead of legislation, why are conservatives cheering across the nation?....bc they hope the court will do what legislation never will. See. Both. Sides.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Atticus59914029 I ain’t no Gator Hater. I went to @SouthernMiss I am neutral lol.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EyeOnUtah You’re kidding right? Trump literally thinks judges and courts should do his bidding. All the @GOP touted was yay we’re in power we’re gonna stack the courts and MAGA!!! See. Both. Sides. I won’t deny democrats do the same thing. Will you acknowledge that of conservatives?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m not gonna lie. I like the nom. I think she’ll be like Gorsuch and Kav and say what’s precedent is precedent. I love a strong woman. But the min she strips rights from my gay friends I’m going scorched earth on her. Jus’ sayin’. #SCOTUSNomination #AmyConeyBarrett<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@40AcresBuilt She’s Catholic?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fi_virginia I giggled when Trump said that then said “oh that’s good!” Like it was the 1st time he was aware of that. I really appreciated her giving her bbsitter props &amp; not pretending she and hubs do it all alone. I nannied for busy parents and being recognized had to have felt good to her<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dpburnette @sethcahn @TheValuesVoter @JoeBiden Pick me!!!! ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sethcahn @dpburnette @TheValuesVoter @JoeBiden They’ll change when they see for themselves tho. No amount of blistering attacks will help. Trust me I go full scorched earth on FB and it leads no where. Ha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sethcahn @dpburnette @TheValuesVoter @JoeBiden Seth, he isn’t changing his mind. You and I know these things and have decided we won’t support Trump. It’s ok if he doesn’t support either. God’s got this, friend!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dpburnette @sethcahn @TheValuesVoter @JoeBiden And that’s fine. What’s your plan? My husband wrote-in in 2016. I get it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dpburnette @sethcahn @TheValuesVoter @JoeBiden You’re funny. I like you. 🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dpburnette @sethcahn @TheValuesVoter @JoeBiden Stick to your guns on voting your conscious. I would only offer this advice. Third party voting likely got us Trump. So if you hate him and what he’s done to America, I’d consider a  vote for a Biden to reject Trumpism. But again, vote your conscious. 🗳💪🏽<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lovely. MAGA, you own this. #election2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rjeff74 @dpburnette @TheValuesVoter “And we shall know them by their fruit.” Eyes to see lack of fruit &amp; spirit of discernment to smell rotten fruit.

<|startoftext|>@rjeff74 @dpburnette @TheValuesVoter Not until he wants to change. It’s called the ABC and th at are taught to first graders in Sunday school. First you admit you’re a sinner which he never has.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dpburnette @rjeff74 @TheValuesVoter Good on you. I also have great criticism for both sides. I voted for Bush, McCain and Romney.

<|startoftext|>@dpburnette @TheValuesVoter In due respect, I disagree. He isn’t morally corrupt. He doesn’t have a record of “it is what it is” when citizens suffer.

<|startoftext|>Today I had a discussion on pro-life contrasted to anti-abortion with a fellow Christian. It went well until I was told I actually wasn’t a true believer if I didn’t vote for Trump. #notacult #Election2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@fi_virginia @senatemajldr @realDonaldTrump Now I read he said the Kav hearing changed that stance. He has said a vote will proceed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EdGreenberger How did it change anything? Because Kav was called out for his past? Whah whah whah.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SherrySherrmorr @fi_virginia It’s on video him saying he’s delay during election if primaries had begun. But then again videos and recording mean nothing anymore.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JeffereyNies @TheValuesVoter Great points, I like it!

<|startoftext|>@TheValuesVoter Yes. Also to consider, in a cult there is an idol. While he is treated as blameless, he isn’t the idol.

<|startoftext|>@TheValuesVoter Great thread, and I’m sure there are many. Peer pressure hard. I wish more of them had boldness to go against the flow.

<|startoftext|>@Atticus59914029 Shame on them for not having the moral compass and wisdom to reject it, especially “believers.” God is really separating the sheep from the goats, my friend. Not by which candidate we support, but by what behavior we defend and even emulate. 🐑 🐐<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Atticus59914029 2) I, like most of you, am looked down on as a non-Trumper, especially in a strong red territory. This sometimes trickles down to my kids. These people have no shame.

<|startoftext|>@Atticus59914029 1) My 5th grader was pressured to vote Trump in a mock election. He said we should “try a woman for POTUS” &amp; was ridiculed. Teaching moment for him; stand up against mob-rule when you know your beliefs. #neverhate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@just_mindy I see your point. But it’s hard to make this stick w/ the other side when Trump does things like wish Maxwell well.😖 She has only been charged, but you see my point. The GOP no longer holds the high ground. Too many issues w/ the leader. I wish they did, or I’ll still be GOP. 😩<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AgainstTrumpism 🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@just_mindy Actually I’d say most don’t vote. Peaceful protestors, ok, I’ll give you that. Violent looters and rioters? Nope. Won’t darken the door of the voting booth.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnFugelsang 🤭🤭🤭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The truth is, you can’t believe Christian values should be taught in school &amp; also support “American exceptionalism” being taught. Tribalism goes against the very nature of God. Helping our children value the global community is necessary for them to embrace God’s sovereign plan  https://t.co/hDZG0YeTGe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In case anyone is wondering how behind and frustrated students are...my youngest is an advanced reader and speller &amp; is having a lot of trouble spelling, now crying over it. He’s also advanced in math &amp; is having issues with it also. This isn’t working. #schoolsreopening<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@secupp @maxwelltani Actually, this is a very important conversation among Christians who are learning even popular leaders of the faith can fool you. And that the use of the spirit of discernment is needed bigly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HuffHanna @Franklin_Graham And makes you a textbook Christian hypocrite for shaming others your whole life for such behavior.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HuffHanna I knew he was skanky for a long long time. And yes. He led the evangelical parade to Trumpism.  Along with @Franklin_Graham.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love America, but we don’t corner the market on being exceptional. This denies an American child the proper understanding of our global community. This is tribalism &amp; I reject it.   #RepublicanConvention 🐘 #hardpass 🛑 #ActsEverywhereInTheWorld 🌎   https://t.co/fKiVi8YQlE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HuffHanna I’m not an evangelical. 😬<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t mistake my political tweets for government worship. My allegiance is to my Lord. He alone will bring true unity &amp; peace to each heart. I enjoy political banter, esp during election years, but make no mistake: the only One in charge of our destiny is God. #Election2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>“Conservatives” throw stones at Biden when he/campaign clarifies statements, often offering an apology. That’s called decency and responsibility. When asked to clarify statements, 45 replies, “No one has done what I’ve done.” That’s called narcissism. @TheValuesVoter<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ProjectLincoln #lincolnvoter Because I refuse to watch four more years of America being the laughing stock of the free world. Tired of bigoted, ignorant and outrageous rhetoric/lies.
