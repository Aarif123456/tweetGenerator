<|startoftext|>@B_Royston @the_year_is_one @ScottAdamsSays  https://t.co/xyIZTjtMXs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Polling is showing that a vast majority of Americans believe the election was stolen. Dems think Biden will ascend to the Presidency, while GOP still believes Trump can win. No matter what happens half the population is sitting on a powder keg that hasn't gone off yet. #dangerous<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The left's excitement about fake news of Trump conceding just shows you how bad they need him to. They are afraid that if he doesn't the auditors might find enough illegitimate ballots to change the results. 11,000 illegitimate ballots in a state shouldn't even be hard to find.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@the_year_is_one @B_Royston @ScottAdamsSays I literally just pointed out that you guys are completely unaware that the evidence has not even gone to court yet lol! It hasn't even had a chance to be presented yet and your defense of your low information bubble is to admit, again in public, that you are unaware of this fact?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B_Royston @the_year_is_one @ScottAdamsSays There's so much evidence it's coming out of a firehose! Ya really believe 180,000 people in a row voted for Biden in a swing County where Trump's way ahead? You really want to talk about reality when you're unaware that no evidence has had a chance for presentation in court yet?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B_Royston @the_year_is_one @ScottAdamsSays Our movement will continue with Trump as President for the next four years. But if by some crazy stroke of luck Biden actually takes office, look out. It will be 2 years of impeachment proceedings and biggest information campaign that you've ever seen (to prove fraud).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PHXKen3 @redheadbf @DrPaulGosar @realDonaldTrump John McCain can go fuck himself. He told us in his autobiography that anybody who criticized him for giving the pony Steele dossier to Comey can go to hell. Well he went first.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WatchMeBGreat @DrPaulGosar @realDonaldTrump Yea they are. Do you understand how time works? It keeps things from happening all at once.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B_Royston @the_year_is_one @ScottAdamsSays He went from 5% GOP approval to nearly 100%. I don't think we have ever seen someone pull off a 95% swing in the polls before. THAT is a communication genius.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B_Royston @the_year_is_one @ScottAdamsSays He's often been regarded as by far the greatest tweeter of all time but okay. You'll go with just aight hu?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B_Royston @the_year_is_one @ScottAdamsSays It looks like no evidence has been presented at all in court yet, and none of these cases have gone to federal court yet. But as far as Trump calling her a part of the team...doesn't he generalize things sometimes for simpler communication?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B_Royston @the_year_is_one @ScottAdamsSays No the Obama appointed judge refused to see any evidence presented. Now we are going to Federal Court where we can actually present evidence for the first time how about you wait and see you what's in it? Nothing to see here huh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B_Royston @the_year_is_one @ScottAdamsSays My methodology is looking for a pinion that is presented as fact<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B_Royston @the_year_is_one @ScottAdamsSays This article is rife with fake news. One of the first things it says is that Sidney Powell has made unsubstantiated claims, when that is exactly the opposite of what has happened. She simply reported that someone else made a claim that was substantiated. Can't get more fake!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B_Royston @the_year_is_one @ScottAdamsSays Absolutely she was never a part of the team to begin with and this way she can pursue the software fraud while Rudy pursues the equal protection violations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can we talk about the fact that the #DNC put out talking points in October that Trump would be way ahead on #Election Day but would lose days later due to #MailInBallots? ü§î #Stopthesteal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B_Royston @the_year_is_one @ScottAdamsSays Well there's a lot of fake news in the articles about this so we don't even know if she's at odds with the rest of the team yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B_Royston @the_year_is_one @ScottAdamsSays I believe it's a proven possible outcome, how likely that outcome is, is another question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottAdamsSays He probably means to misdirect about who would have a plausible opportunity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B_Royston @the_year_is_one @ScottAdamsSays How many times do you have to be told that you are confusing other lawsuits with the Trump campaign? Being dismiss the way it was allows them to Fast Track to the Supreme Court. The judge never looked at the evidence they would not allow it to be presented which I'm sure you love  https://t.co/5VreczbgTL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B_Royston @the_year_is_one @ScottAdamsSays We haven't lost in court one time yet not a single time this was a huge win for us because we can fast track to the Supreme Court now. Thank you to the Obama judge that refused to even look at the evidence all of you Liberals are the same. Nothing to see here!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B_Royston @the_year_is_one @ScottAdamsSays Here ya go. Apparently they didn't even present evidence because an Obaman judge didn't want to see it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@the_year_is_one @B_Royston @ScottAdamsSays You realize the lawsuit hasn't gone to court yet right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B_Royston @the_year_is_one @ScottAdamsSays If this is one of the campaign's 3 suits, that would explain this  https://t.co/HzCfiFyfJr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@the_year_is_one @B_Royston @ScottAdamsSays "They" haven't lost any. They have only filed 3 lawsuits. You guys keep conflating other election lawsuits to the Trump campaign. Fake news.  https://t.co/kfyCiy4ogx<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B_Royston @the_year_is_one @ScottAdamsSays You probably aren't aware of how prosecutions work but before they present the evidence they must gather it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@brandon212_ @mike_wanaoni @ProjectLincoln No what Trump's own lawyers say is that NONE of their lawsuits have been thrown out because the ones you're talking about aren't even their cases.

<|startoftext|>@brandon212_ @mike_wanaoni @ProjectLincoln You're not following. The down ballot lawsuits were unconnected to Trump, that's where you're getting this big fake news number. The important ones we've already won, and the others were just a stalling tactic so they could package together the major suit that just dropped.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@brandon212_ @mike_wanaoni @ProjectLincoln You've been #hoaxed. Trump won 3 times in a row and even with the Supreme Court. The ballots that put Biden over the top in PA were counted in violation of judge Alito's court order. We don't even need the court wins, but we got them anyway and PA will remain red.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@brandon212_ @mike_wanaoni @ProjectLincoln The Trump legal team has not yet shown the courts the statistical proof of electonic duplicating of ballots through the Dominion software. It exists, trust me. We haven't had any recounts either. You don't think they can find 11,000 illegal votes in a state? It won't even be hard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Trump's legal team says the statistical data in their possession is proof that votes were duplicated. But are we heading for another O.J. trial situation where the public did not yet understand the significance of D.N.A.? Proof only matters if the public can understand the data.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@suzanneLou82 @someone2listen @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump If Biden by some miracle wins in the Supreme Court he will be the first American dictator elected by a fake uncredible process, and every President after him will also be a Democrat dictator elected by a fake uncredible process where postal workers decide who's President.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@suzanneLou82 @someone2listen @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump We just went through a Russian style election that will soon be overturned. They do the exact same thing in Russia, they reverse the results in the week after the election by only counting Putin votes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@someone2listen @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Correction: he will serve two terms once the Supreme Court rules on the proof of voter fraud, and the #shampeachment was never convicted, he was found innocent of all the non-crimes he was accused of.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One side thinks there's cheating &amp; the other doesn't. So I guess we have to wait and see what evidence they produce for the courts to decide. Useless arguing about what evidence we haven't seen because the smoking guns are being saved for litigation.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Kaevaec @glamelegance @realDonaldTrump The first thing Trump did as President elect is guaruntee a pardon to Hillary in November of 2016 saying she's good people.

<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump That isn't a point because it doesn't even make any sense lol! The context you gave was that Trump wants to purposely cause a public health crises and get people killed because it gives him pleasure to watch people die. Am I getting this right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Fee Fi Fo Fum I smell a fake news story gonna come! This seems important to your belief system that Trump has mental illness so show me where he said that if you can find it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump A person can't be a con man smart enough to manipulate tens of millions of people and also be dumb enough to think mishandling a crises in public would help his reelection chances. Those are not the same person. You kinda gotta choose the smart evil villain or the hapless idiot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump I suspect you have false memories about who Trump called scum and treasonous for several reasons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Your mind is very susceptible to false memories.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump That's called branding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Let's see where have I heard that before? #finepeoplehoax<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Again, he didn't say those things, at least not to the people you claimed. That was pretty obvious fake news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump When I said he literally has no ego I mean he appears to have achieved ego death. His over inflated ego is a persona that he only brings out when it's useful to the situation. A narcissist on the other hand has no control over their ego and cannot tamp it down the way Trump does<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump You called him a malignant narcissist LOL! Pelosi and Schumer have called him a deranged racist for years! You're seriously going to complain if he gives these people humorous nick names in return??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Very Stable Genius, or VSG. That tweet where he first coined that was pretty damn funny you gotta admit. The guy has some golden tweets. Trump can adjust his ego for whatever size fits the occasion best. Rally Trump, press conference Trump &amp; SOTU Trump are all very diff people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Actually it's a Roger Stone line that Trump adopted for his nomination acceptance speech. Stone theorized that Republicans were ready to embrace the strong man persona. I think he was right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Oh so we finally have something specific that you can offer as evidence he's a "malignant narcissist": name calling! Nothing ironic about that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump He literally has no ego. A narcissist is driven by ego. Trump does things that he knows he well be ridiculed for and it doesn't seem to bother him one bit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump And I'm sure it doesn't bother him one bit that you and many others hop on his tweets and call him the worst things imaginable. A narcissist would care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Millions of Obama voters voted for Trump. Black people will probably be what reelects him. The undeniable truth is that people like you and I are literally living in two simultaneously different realities, and both can't be true. He can't be a good person and also be a killer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Says the guy who takes the advice of another guy who's never even talked to Trump before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Hitler literally came within weeks of obtaining world domination, where his explicit plan was to murder everyone and rule for a thousand years. He almost succeeded and Trump is the first threat to destroying the world? Really?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Well obviously, you're comparing him to mass murderers üòÑ I think it's safe to assume you don't think he's a nice guy. But lots of people like me who are responsible and intelligent don't see the monster stuff. We don't see the narcissist stuff. How do you explain that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Does he know Donald Trump?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Your third eye predicting well is it? I predicted he'd win the first time and that he'd vilolate TDS expectations by not doing anything dictator-ish at all. How am I doin?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Who? Some arm chair psychologist?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Well see the difference is of course that those were homicidal maniacs who murdered their own people to gain and keep power, and Trump is a seemingly nice guy who got elected by a Democratic process but besides that....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Your fears of him being a heartless sociopath look irrational because the reasons are very vague.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump I'm talking to you because I sympathize with your worldview, I think it must be a terrible burden. I feel sorry for anyone who sincerely believes that a monster inhabited the white house. I'm here to aleviate your fears and I fear that you've been hoodwinked by the press<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Still makes no sense. What am I supposed to be afraid of here, that Trump has a very special kind of evil that takes exactly 4 years to take effect and kick in? Any day now he'll start to do all kinds of debauchery!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump I'm familiar with the line. I'm also know who came for the Jews and I don't appreciate the administration I publicly support being compared to any fascist regime. I don't need the false idea in people's heads that Trump supporters are down with crap like that it puts us in danger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Trump would have to be the dumbest person on the planet to believe that doing a terrible job protecting American citizens would help him get re-elected. That's just too dumb to take seriously I'm sorry man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Did we just go full on Godwin's Law? Oh boy I think you just signaled that you're out of meaningful things to say, the nazi comparisons come out when the conversation is in death throws.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump A lot of your theories might fall into the category of "anything's possible". Trump purposely mishandling a pandemic in order to win an election is so far fetched that I have a hard time even thinking it's a possible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Yea which is why I suspect those may not have been real arrests lol I would have fought back way more convincingly than these people did. I would have FREAKED OUT. No way I'm letting them gently escort me into a van.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Yea that sounds like the system working the way it's supposed to, let them get to the bottom of it I'm definitely VERY curious about there secret police story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump If you're asking why the KKK isn't being detained I think they are also designated as terrorists, and that Trump would relish the opportunity to arrests some on camera.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump I'm confident that's not whats happening here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Maybe. I'm not sure how that worka in terrorist situations, but who's to say they didn't have probable cause? Of course the person getting arrested is going to say they don't! A person getting arrested always says there's no probable cause! So do their attorneys!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Say whaaat lol? Who brought the boogie man into the conversation üòÑ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Again, IF the person is actually being arrested and IF they are a citizen or protestor and IF they are a suspected or known member of a designated terrorist organization...I think that changes the rules on detainment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump I already said that I suspect those were fake arrests because that's exactly whay they looked like. Ocam's razor right? And don't tell me you're trying to resurrect the #finepeoplehoax please. No one has time for all that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump That didn't answer my question. If someone is a suspected or known member of a federally designated terrorist group, I think that changes the rules on detainment. Just sayin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump You don't think all of the Democrat candidates including Hillary have disrespected Trump supporters and put them in danger? They have man, they definitely have. It's just ironic because your side is doing exactly what you imagine Trump did, but I haven't seen any examples.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Mmmhmmm. So doesn't it matter who these people are? I'm assuming they're antifa, that's the going theory, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump I don't think that's true. I don't think you're lying either, you should probably double check your sources on that one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump No think about this, I've invited you to fact check me but I don't think there's a single example of Trump disrespecting American citizens like yourself. All of his Democrat opponents have disrespected me personally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Of people who's faces were obscured and who didn't put up a real fight. You or I would be freaking the fuck out in that situation. An unidentified group of camo wearing men snatching a person into a van? And they just walk with them? It could be extractions of undercover guys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Fact check me, but unlike ALL of his Democrat opponents, I don't believe Trump has ever said anything disrespectful to American citizens of any kind. He goes hard sometimes at public figures who step in the ring with him sometimes, but usually his responses are meant for humor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump He looks well meaning and kind hearted to me and millions of other reasonable and intelligent people. How do you explain that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump I don't think that theory matches the known facts very well. It looked more like an extraction of a fellow agent under the guise of arrest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump It's honestly fascinating to talk to someone who believes that, because I don't see any indication of him being a cruel person at all. In fact I think his disregard for what anyone thinks of him is quite the opposite of a narcissistic quality. I do appreciate your cander.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Really, you think Trump's motivations are to put children in physical danger? Really guy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump I'm pretty sure you're overly simplifying the situation to back up and maintain your irrational world view that Trump is dumb enough to think mishandling a pandemic will help him win an election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Lenon wasn't talking about a plan to publicly destroy his own country in order the win a free Democratic election, but for some strange reason you are convinced that Trump thinks that's a great plan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump He probably supports mask wearing so much that he can't say so publicly or wear one. He probably knows that the fake news would successfully convince you and every other TDS victim to not wear masks just to go against Trump  It's that simple, because that's exactly what they'd do<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Again, the administration is saying that they have plenty of money left over for that very purpose that they haven't used yet. The say they intend to use the funds for testing and tracing. No one wants to shut down testing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump That was a rally joke dude. How is he a dictator he has spent 4 years being the opposite of one and doing everything a dictator wouldn't. He won't even support mandatory masks and the first thing he did after election day is tell the world he didn't want to investigate Hillary!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Well from what I read, their explanation is apparently that they haven't spent all of the money already approved for testing and they believe the additional funds would be put to better use in other ways at this point in time. Doesn't that make a lot more sense than... cruelty??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Alright calm down there Edgar Alllen Poe! I was speaking about his tactics in general, I don't think he's purposely creating chaos because I don't even think he's mismanaging the pandemic - much less on purpose!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump I keep hinting at the fact that neither of us can read his mind so that we can steer this lovely debate back into a reality based one. Why do you believe that he believes the pabdemic will go away on it's own? That's very different than just mismanaging a crises on purpose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump He does thrive on chaos but that's a killer instinct quality. He changes all the variables of a situation &amp; will shake the box in order to reassess where all the pieces lay. It's one of his signiture moves, but he's not.dumb enough to think mishandling a pandemic helps him at all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Read that on your crystal ball did you üîÆ? What's he feeling like having for breakfast right now? While your in the inner sanctums of the man's mind, can you please tell me if he's privately so dumb that he thinks we live in a world where getting people killed gets you reelected<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Whether or not you think he'll accept the election results, you still think he wants to win right? Who the hell would come up with a plan to get reelected that obviously looks not just incompetent, but worse, intentionally cruel? That makes NO sense whatever lol!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump I'm pretty sure I never said he'd do anything to get elected üòÑ But see that's what I mean, your argument doesn't make any sense to me. How would it help Trump get re-elected if he purposely mismanages a pandemic? You think he wants to do a terrible job and get people killed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Yea I'm a Christian, but I agree with you if you're concerned about the rush to get back to church. I think if worshipping in the congregation risks killing your grandparent then you're doing it wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Woah there partner! Wouldn't it be a dictatorship if he starts a third term? Second terms are actually the norm. How has Trump put himself over the nation?? That argument doesn't even make any sense to me.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump In what world is it bad for the country if the President is doing things to get re-elected?

<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump The Attorney General has been giving updates on their investigation into #spygate!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump We have more recent polling as well, but if Trump is anywhere north of 10% black support the election is over. The Trump campaign's internal polling supposedly has him around 20% right now.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump We know for a fact that John Kerry violated the Logan Act! That's not up for debate.

<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Failed reality TV star? He was the highest rated show on television! We don't have to wonder what Trump will be like as President, we had years of the greatest economy in the history of the world, and he did everything the way a dictator would not. He won't even require masks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump No, Flynn talked to Russian diplomats on his way into the job where his entire reason for going to work is to talk to foreign diplomats. That's the exact same thing every administration does before inauguration day, only Obama's administration broke the law by talking after 2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump What makes you think he won't win in a landslide again? African American support for Trump is historically high.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump The government investigated that meeting ad nasuem, and found nothing wrong with it. The fact that you're still talking about it now shows how little you have to complain about Trump. He's so squeaky clean that you have to mention a normal meeting Trump had nothing to do with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Boring! But I'll agree with you on one thing: the next President in 2025 will be a reaction to Trump, so they'll be VERY boring.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Lied about what lol? He was accused of requesting information on whether or not a leading presidential candidate is controlled by Russia. That's his job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Nothing was said because the meeting never happened lol! Some lawyer who happens to be ethnically Russian tried to get a seat at a table where she could have some sort of influence over Don Jr. He walked out and never gave her the time of day. That's called integrity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump It was a joke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump The FBI had dirt on his sons. He was apparently trying to protect them and take the attention.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump If he made a joke and a few Russian trolls did something Trump isn't responsible for that and he certainly doesn't deserve life in prison lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump He was lying about doing his job legally, believe it or not. Why would anyone even care about a war veteran General not disclosing all the details of his job he's doing legally lol?? It's ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Obstruction of Congress isn't a crime, it's something they made up because Trump did the right thing and asked the 3rd branch of government, the Supreme Court, to resolve a conflict with the other two branches of government. That is EXACTLY how our system was designed to work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump 1 was...wait for it...a joke. He said that during a rally and everyone laughed. Hate to break it to ya but shooting someone on 5th avenue and only liking war heros who weren't captured were both jokes too. I'm not sure what you're referring to with #2. DOJ's investigating spygate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Mind reading alert! I seriously doubt Trump wants to "become the State" üòÑ Flynn was obviously the victim of a witch hunt that was determined to imprison someone working for Trump. The FBI notes show that they planned on tricking him into lying so he could be pressured to squeal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump Republicans were smart to not treat it like a real trial and dismiss it as the #shampeachment it was. Why would Senate Democrats feel like they need additional testimony when House Democrats could have easily called more people to testify? They knew they didn't have enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump The first time was a hoax, and the second time was his JOB. If the President sees potential conflicts of interest between a leading presidential candidate and a foreign enemy, it is his job to ensure the integrity of the election by asking it be looked into. Hillary paid Russia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@samtosane @wendyfranklin2 @509ShawnG @realDonaldTrump The word complicit implies a crime was committed, but the entire argument for impeachment was that crimes aren't needed. The Senate did their job &amp; found the man innocent because he never did anything wrong. Your assumption that he is drunk on power is not backed by anything real<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Vickyro86991203 @DianeToucan @NotHoodlum @realDonaldTrump I have the transcript and the video of Trump saying, without promoting, "I'm not talking about the neo nazis and white nationalists because they should be condemned totally".

<|startoftext|>@Vickyro86991203 @DianeToucan @NotHoodlum @realDonaldTrump Trump correctly assumed there were fine people on both sides of the statue removal debate. He was right. Many people who attended were unaware of the organizers and unfamiliar with the speakers. Trump comdemned the nazis directly, and said he was not referring to them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DianeToucan @Vickyro86991203 @NotHoodlum @realDonaldTrump No, you never heard him say that. It never happened.

<|startoftext|>@BurtGreeves @MLEco2h2o @Rolasmex @hadstead @acnewsitics @realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs More like the Dem party platform in 2012 demands a border wall, Trump comes along and says that the wall can be paid for in trade deals, liberals forget about both, call him a liar for no reason and then twist themselves into a pretzel because they can't agree w/ orange man bad.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Marc_de_K @Liz57799642 @clairbyrd6 @realDonaldTrump For the last time, Trump is the only one to demand other countries pay more for defense and he got what he asked for.

<|startoftext|>@FrankBelcher15 @romanbaird65 @Liz57799642 @clairbyrd6 @realDonaldTrump You're missing the point.

<|startoftext|>@FrankBelcher15 @romanbaird65 @Liz57799642 @clairbyrd6 @realDonaldTrump I never said Obama didn't stabalize the economy, I believe he did.

<|startoftext|>@romanbaird65 @Liz57799642 @clairbyrd6 @realDonaldTrump Obama lost over 300,000 manufacturing jobs, and Trump has added 4 times that but we're not here to talk about Obama.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@romanbaird65 @Liz57799642 @clairbyrd6 @realDonaldTrump Obama left office with fewer people working or owning homes than anytime since the 1970's but we're not here to talk about him.

<|startoftext|>@romanbaird65 @Liz57799642 @clairbyrd6 @realDonaldTrump I never said he replaced anything. He combined 2 different pandemic offices to reduce duplicacy which is the opposite, and then a disgruntled employee complained about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@romanbaird65 @FrankBelcher15 @Liz57799642 @clairbyrd6 @realDonaldTrump Not in this current reality. No that all happened üòÑ might wanna switch your "news" up a little.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@romanbaird65 @Liz57799642 @clairbyrd6 @realDonaldTrump Nope. Stock market hit record highs over 100 times since Trump's election, GDP started growing again and unemployment had the best numbers in history. Millions of jobs created and trillions of dollars invested in our economy. Jobs repatraited and the manufacturing industry saved.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@romanbaird65 @FrankBelcher15 @Liz57799642 @clairbyrd6 @realDonaldTrump Those are basic verifiable facts. Just because you won't hear them on CNN doesn't make them not true. The U.S. has done far more testing than any other nation, we're exporting ventilators all over the globe because we made more than anywhere else, &amp; we lead the way with medicine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankBelcher15 @squadric @Chris81Boggs @joncoopertweets @elonmusk Well I think we both agree he's not dumb then - that's a start! You can't be a con man and fool 70 million + people and be dumb, would you agree?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankBelcher15 @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump Did I say that no one proof reads? No I said that sometimes Trump is a little incorrect intentionally. Operating in a narrow band of wrongness is what AOC does too. It makes you focus on whatever they are tweeting about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Liz57799642 @romanbaird65 @clairbyrd6 @realDonaldTrump That's literally all he's done. That's what he's been criticized for. He deferred to Fauci and Birx's advive on everything.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FrankBelcher15 @Liz57799642 @romanbaird65 @clairbyrd6 @realDonaldTrump The U.S. response has been the best in the world with testing, ventilator production, and scientific breakthroughs. The President's job is to make decisions and he has listened to the top medical experts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Liz57799642 @pauliebee57 @clairbyrd6 @realDonaldTrump So why do tens of thousands fight for seats in arenas to laugh for an hour and a half at his stand up routines?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankBelcher15 @pauliebee57 @Liz57799642 @clairbyrd6 @realDonaldTrump Yea some do say that, but it could be said that the late night shows started sounding more angry than funny. It's hard to be funny when you're consumed with a burning hatred for someone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrowShaw @pauliebee57 @Liz57799642 @clairbyrd6 @realDonaldTrump It's pathetic that the President seems to be enjoying his job so much he makes everyone around him laugh and have a great experience?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Liz57799642 @clairbyrd6 @realDonaldTrump Nations that have to pay billions more in trade deals and defense aren't laughing anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dfaltz @marc_lotter @realDonaldTrump Most of the gaffes started out as harmless, but at this point he's slurring his speech and having trouble completing sentences. It's unfortunate because a few years ago Biden had great mental agility. He forgot Obama's name. He's actually been hospitalized twice for strokes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pauliebee57 @Liz57799642 @clairbyrd6 @realDonaldTrump Does it matter who thinks he might be the funniest President ever? Debating that point is a long way from Liz saying the man has no sense of humor üòÑ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrowShaw @pauliebee57 @Liz57799642 @clairbyrd6 @realDonaldTrump Various interviews and podcasts, is it really that hard to believe that professional humorists would find the guy who tweets hillarious things every day and has 30,000 people laughing for hours in rallies is...funny? Seriously? You have seem him in front of a crowd, right??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@menotyou48 @Liz57799642 @clairbyrd6 @realDonaldTrump About a third of the population isn't born with a sense of humor. Thank you Mr. President for helping us to continually spot them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Liz57799642 @romanbaird65 @clairbyrd6 @realDonaldTrump He followed the advice of top medical experts every step of the way, except for when he took action to close travel from China early which they all agree now saved countless lives.

<|startoftext|>@romanbaird65 @Liz57799642 @clairbyrd6 @realDonaldTrump Trump didn't cause a pandemic. Until now every measurable piece of data showed a drastically improving economy. Be grateful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scwat @WontBeSilent2 @Dreamweasel @realDonaldTrump More like Trump gets accused of saying something he literally never said, and then when liberals are challenged to find video proof they resort to "I heard it with my own ears!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scwat @Dreamweasel @realDonaldTrump Must be nice to not realize your own side has hoaxed you for years.

<|startoftext|>@Liz57799642 @romanbaird65 @clairbyrd6 @realDonaldTrump Luck does, but persuasion technique doesn't. That's why he just keeps on winning.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Liz57799642 @clairbyrd6 @realDonaldTrump Really LOL? A lot of comedians call him the funniest President of all time because his sense of humor is one of his defining characteristics! His rallies are literally stand up routines, what planet did you just arrive from? You're missing the greatest show on earth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@romanbaird65 @clairbyrd6 @realDonaldTrump So you're in the camp that thinks he's just a lucky clown. That frame is so 2016 dude, there's been a few NY Times best sellers on the genuis of Trump's persuasion game since then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@romanbaird65 @clairbyrd6 @realDonaldTrump It's not sophisticated, it's a corney folksy one liner.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@143humanrace @larsoer @realDonaldTrump You're either behind the times on watching old Biden clips compared to new ones, or just lying beecause you're not a public figure who's reputation would be tarnished by Defending Biden's brain. Biden used to be sharp and quick a few years ago. Unfortunately, something changed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cryptosophus @tj_melon @realDonaldTrump So are you. Step one: Trump tweets something mildly funny. Step two: gullible liberals freak out and think he's serious. Step three: the tweet becomes 10 times funnier because the troller in chief made the left's hair catch on fire again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leementley @realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs I hope these Clorox hoax memes continue so we can keep being able to spot those on Twitter who can't pass an I.Q. test.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tanissue @BradCelmainis @realDonaldTrump Same to you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@romanbaird65 @clairbyrd6 @realDonaldTrump You think he didn't laugh to himself that a bunch of left wing haters would get their hair caught on fire at the joke that he needs lawyers in the family? Really? This is the same guy who loves rubbing it in that he's never been accused of a crime before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dreamweasel All the House Of Representatives have been talking about this week is the origins of the #RussiaHoax! You should probably quit pretending Trump colluded, Democrats are trying to pretend that embarrassing chapter in history never happened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cryptosophus @tj_melon @realDonaldTrump It's pretty obvious, and because he was tweeting lol. He's always joking in his tweets, the left is just cognitively blind to it. Fascinating really. He likes to trigger people who have no sense of humor, THAT'S the joke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@romanbaird65 @clairbyrd6 @realDonaldTrump Almost everytime he tweets he's joking, some liberals just haven't caught on yet. Amazing really.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@143humanrace @larsoer @realDonaldTrump I understand you'd rather vote for a ham sandwich than Trump, but you still know that Biden has lost a step and he has #bidencognitivedecline.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@larsoer @realDonaldTrump Trump is the same he was four years ago, warts and all. But no one is willing to say in public that Biden is mentally competent. Democrats failed to offer the Republic a spare emergency backup to take over.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FrankBelcher15 @squadric @Chris81Boggs @joncoopertweets @elonmusk Well no one is good enough to persuade everyone to every point all the time, but using technique can move the needle more than if you don't.

<|startoftext|>@buzzyb45487961 @ICEINTERN @cnnbrk Because I'm in my prime and I'm in excellent health! In order to take a prescription medication before any symptoms I'd have to go to the black market. If I get sick I'm going to find a doctor that will agree to prescribe it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EslynGarb @Kof5Victor @squadric @beefbagel @LempaLyn @Chris81Boggs @joncoopertweets @elonmusk You forget what happened to Mitt Romney.

<|startoftext|>@FrankBelcher15 @squadric @Chris81Boggs @joncoopertweets @elonmusk You're the one who's dumb enough not to realize both versions are hearsay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankBelcher15 @squadric @Chris81Boggs @joncoopertweets @elonmusk ...and the more the left debated what word he was incorrectly using to describe border barriers, the more the entire media focused on immigration.

<|startoftext|>@EslynGarb @Kof5Victor @squadric @beefbagel @LempaLyn @Chris81Boggs @joncoopertweets @elonmusk I have studied his life. He started with a loan of a million and turned that into 10 billion. That takes more than just luck.

<|startoftext|>@Agatha07079227 @Kof5Victor @squadric @beefbagel @LempaLyn @Chris81Boggs @joncoopertweets @elonmusk If that were true every unclever white person you hand and a dollar to would turn that dollar into a hundred thousand. Sooo your racist theory doesn't hold up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EslynGarb @Kof5Victor @squadric @beefbagel @LempaLyn @Chris81Boggs @joncoopertweets @elonmusk Correction: he started off with a 1 million dollar loan when he took over the family business, and turned it into 10 billion dollars using the art of the deal. Along the way as he diversified, a few licensing projects that he had no management over bankrupted like normal business<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@idesignecourses @merlisa @debwalkwilliams @johnrobertsFox @realDonaldTrump The financial motive hoax was debunked almost as long ago as the Clorox injection hoax. Trump has around thirty bucks in Sanafi, a parent company. He's not making any money, and to assume that he'd put people's lives at risk to make a few bucks is bat shit level craziness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SwaffordGreg @an_caping @DavidJHarrisJr @elonmusk Is there a point that you're arriving anytime soon lol?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jsatz23 @cnnbrk First off, he has NO financial interest in it because that fake news story was debunked weeks ago. Second, he has no reason to lie. Taking it is smart if you don't watch the liberal propaganda.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MolenaVal @cnnbrk Why the hell would he lie about taking a miracle drug that studies show has no risk and the potential to save your life?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ICEINTERN @cnnbrk Seriously? You still believe the Lysol hoax? There's virtually no risk to taking hydroxy. It's been around for decades, and CNN is lying about the studies.

<|startoftext|>@raygunpunx @watchingstorms @ScottAdamsSays @TeamCavuto No. Doctors have known the risks involved with this miracle drug for decades.

<|startoftext|>@ilickwindowyup @squadric @Kof5Victor @beefbagel @LempaLyn @Chris81Boggs @joncoopertweets @elonmusk Oh this person hates America and Americans, no wander they're liberal!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KAG202020999960 @idesignecourses @merlisa @debwalkwilliams @johnrobertsFox @realDonaldTrump Rose, that fake news story about financial incentive was debunked a few weeks ago. Trump owns about 29 dollars in Sanafi stock. He's not earning any money, and to assume he'd risk millions of people's lives to make a few hundred bucks is just bat shit crazy mind reading.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHornischer @johnrobertsFox @realDonaldTrump Mind reader says what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ez4u2say_Janis @johnrobertsFox @realDonaldTrump You think Trump wouldn't take hydroxy when there's no risk and a good chance it saves him from getting sick?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JessicaGirardo @debwalkwilliams @johnrobertsFox @realDonaldTrump That's terrible what happened to you, but taking hydroxy is still the smart risk management decision.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@merlisa @debwalkwilliams @johnrobertsFox @realDonaldTrump There's a huge upside to taking it (with zinc) and virtually no downside at all. Trump is leading by example because he understands what smart risk management is and he does not stand to make any money from it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mymichaelryan @Kof5Victor @beefbagel @squadric @LempaLyn @Chris81Boggs @joncoopertweets @elonmusk I didn't say anything about oppresion but they endure more overt public racism than anyone else because left wing bigots have made it socially acceptable to be openly racist against white guys.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@squadric @KristinaHoerler @LempaLyn @Chris81Boggs @joncoopertweets @elonmusk Dude, even Obama admitted that millions of Obama voters voted for Trump in 2016.

<|startoftext|>@squadric @Kof5Victor @beefbagel @LempaLyn @Chris81Boggs @joncoopertweets @elonmusk The guy is actually blaming racists for losing in 2016 üòÑ OR it could be that Trump is a Master Persuader and that Hillary was a terrible candidate who made one persuasion mistake after another.

<|startoftext|>@KristinaHoerler @squadric @LempaLyn @Chris81Boggs @joncoopertweets @elonmusk If you can't recognize Trump's persuasion genius that's understandable, but at least offer an emergency backup spare replacement to him.

<|startoftext|>@KristinaHoerler @LempaLyn @squadric @Chris81Boggs @joncoopertweets @elonmusk Well Kristina, contrast matters.

<|startoftext|>@NumbersMean @mnissan22 @DK8sam @KamVTV @elonmusk The labor force participation rate doesn't reflect how many are working lol? Oh I see. You Like to use Obama's trick and not count the people who gave up looking for a job as unemployed. That's just sad. You said Saint Barack left office with more people working than ever bahaha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NumbersMean @mnissan22 @DK8sam @KamVTV @elonmusk Can you count?  "the labor force participation rated has dropped from 66 percent in January 2009 to 62.8 percent in August 2016, which is the lowest number in 38 years."  https://t.co/KRz6euPTED<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NumbersMean @mnissan22 @DK8sam @KamVTV @elonmusk Saint Barack left office with fewer people working than anytime since the 70's.

<|startoftext|>@NumbersMean @mnissan22 @DK8sam @KamVTV @elonmusk Trump had the lowest unemployment numbers for blacks, Hispanics, and almost for women too right up until the virus struck.

<|startoftext|>@NumbersMean @mnissan22 @DK8sam @KamVTV @elonmusk Wrong again. But libs all said Trump would tank the economy. Instead, he's had the most successful economy.

<|startoftext|>@squadric @LempaLyn @Chris81Boggs @joncoopertweets @elonmusk I'm complimenting a man's persuasion techniques. You're hurling middle school insults and I'm the troll lol? Mmkay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@squadric @LempaLyn @Chris81Boggs @joncoopertweets @elonmusk I'm someone that has studied persuasion for decades. All kinds of persuasion and communication experts and even a hypnotist have written best sellers on the genius of Trump's communication. It's invisible to someone that doesn't have the training to spot it. Give me any example.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NumbersMean @mnissan22 @DK8sam @KamVTV @elonmusk Actually there were less people working or owning homes since Elvis was still ticking lol! Bruh. The Bureau of Labor Statistics isn't hard to find. I just shared some of their data. Obama downgraded the credit score. Everytime someone critiques Trump it's things they cant measure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NumbersMean @mnissan22 @DK8sam @KamVTV @elonmusk What news are YOU watching? He lost hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs, had fewer people working than anytime in decades, and downgraded the U.S. credit rating!

<|startoftext|>@LempaLyn @squadric @Chris81Boggs @joncoopertweets @elonmusk Damn! You're the first person in the entire country with the balls to say "Biden is mentally incompetent" in pubic! I'm actually impressed! Either you haven't seen the footage, or you forgot the internet lives forever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DK8sam @mnissan22 @KamVTV @elonmusk Of course, and thank you for caring about our soldiers!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NumbersMean @mnissan22 @DK8sam @KamVTV @elonmusk Trump has reached 3%, Obama left office with fewer people working OR owning homes than anytime since the 1970's. And libs all said Trump would tank the economy. Instead, he had the best economic run in history. Anyone saying Trump made things worse doesn't use measurable data.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beefbagel @squadric @Chris81Boggs @joncoopertweets @elonmusk No, but listening to Obama makes me feel sleepy. You know it's true, he's boring - everyone is compared to Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomJChicago The man is exactly the same as he was 4 years ago. He speaks at Robin Williams speed and does mental gymnastics without a teleprompter. But everyone knows Biden has cognitive decline. No one is willing to say in public that Biden is mentally fit to serve. The senility is real.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LempaLyn @squadric @Chris81Boggs @joncoopertweets @elonmusk Everyone knows Trump is exactly the same as he was 4 years ago. Republicans knew what they were getting. Biden can't even remember the name of the President he worked for. No one will say in public that Biden is mentally competent. No one. We all know he's got a raisin brain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DK8sam @mnissan22 @KamVTV @elonmusk Red states. Trump rallies are filled with green Farmers For Trump hats. The 2019 headlines he tweeted were pushing a DNC narrative before the China trade deal was signed. The media wanted China to win, and after America won Trump gave tens of billions of dollars to the farmers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DK8sam @mnissan22 @KamVTV @elonmusk What do you mean?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NumbersMean @mnissan22 @DK8sam @KamVTV @elonmusk Wrong. Lowest unemoloyment numbers in history. Stock market hit record highs over 100 times, and Obama was the only President to never achieve over 3% sustained annual GDP growth. All Trump had to do was not show up drunk to beat Obama's economy.

<|startoftext|>@mnissan22 @DK8sam @KamVTV @elonmusk Bruh. That was what the fake news was saying when they were openly rooting for China to win the trade deal. Like with everything else, Trump won with that too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mnissan22 @DK8sam @KamVTV @elonmusk Maybe in the land on Oz. Did a Nigerian prince tell you that? üòÑ Had any blue pills lately lol? Don't believe everything you read online.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mnissan22 @DK8sam @KamVTV @elonmusk This was fake news before Trump gave the farmers tens of billions of dollars from the China deal. Farmers think he's the best thing since sliced bread. And thanks for proving my point. By any data you can measure, he's improved the economy dramatically.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DK8sam @mnissan22 @KamVTV @elonmusk Why, because I correctly point out that all the talk about Trump destroying things is void of any measurable data lol? Just pay attention to the trend. On MSDNC and CNN every time they start talking about Trump making things worse they purposely don't use any measurable data.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoparMotown Pretty sure everyone who read Musk's tweet understood that in the comments üòÑüòÑ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoparMotown Yea. Cause I just created this account dimwit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mnissan22 @DK8sam @KamVTV @elonmusk Historically low unemployment? Record high stock market? GDP on steroids? Replacing the hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs Obama lost? Repatriating millions of jobs and trillions of dollars? Renegotiating trade deals that democrats even approve of? Measurable data.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoparMotown I'm explaining to you how that phrase has been used by conservatives for the past FEW YEARS. Thousands of people on Twitter didn't just all think Musk meant it that way by accident. You need to catch up son.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LempaLyn @squadric @Chris81Boggs @joncoopertweets @elonmusk The dude talks and processes information at Robin Williams speed, he's a mental gymnast!

It's good to know that you won't say in public that Biden is mentally competent though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoparMotown @DerekNeese @thejtlewis @elonmusk No it's when a person joins the #walkaway movement and realizes Democrats are the party of hoaxes. Now I have no idea what Musk meant by it, just making sure you don't sound ill informed next time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LempaLyn @squadric @Chris81Boggs @joncoopertweets @elonmusk Trump hasn't changed in 4 years. You do realize his Democrat oponent is decomposing in front of us and can't complete a sentence, right?

<|startoftext|>@MoparMotown @DerekNeese @thejtlewis @elonmusk So in your universe conservatives haven't been using the red pill phrase to describe their movement for years. Got it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DK8sam @mnissan22 @KamVTV @elonmusk Even Trump's critics agree that he just keeps on winning. Why do you think that is? It could be that he knows the admin keys to the user interface for reality, and can manifest whatever reality he wants.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mnissan22 @DK8sam @KamVTV @elonmusk Seeing failures as a positive is not at all what Normal Vincent Peale taught üòÑ more like the law of attraction. If you want positive things in your life, think positive thoughts. Visualize what you want and use affirmations.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BagBurn @codeofvets @GenFlynn @SidneyPowell1 Really? You know why?

<|startoftext|>@BagBurn @codeofvets @GenFlynn @SidneyPowell1 The notes from agents show they were trying to trap him in a lie about anything so that they could blackmail his family.

<|startoftext|>@stevep1212 @lynda27580143 @OwnRulesToo @lesleyabravanel @realDonaldTrump He erased Obama's entire legacy with executive fiat.

<|startoftext|>@stevep1212 @lynda27580143 @OwnRulesToo @lesleyabravanel @realDonaldTrump The second technique you just described is called pacing and leading but I think you get the point.

<|startoftext|>@ObserverAmused @lynda27580143 @OwnRulesToo @lesleyabravanel @realDonaldTrump He always said the wall would include fencing from the very beginning, you guys just weren't paying attention.

<|startoftext|>@lynda27580143 @OwnRulesToo @lesleyabravanel @realDonaldTrump How is that a comeback lol?

<|startoftext|>@OwnRulesToo @lesleyabravanel @realDonaldTrump So even if every migrant group carries a ladder a thousand miles, the wall adds friction and still slows them down.

Priming the public for a humiliating loss in order to save face. Be a big boy, take the L, grab ur ball, and go home!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lili1416 @pattysboi1 @lesleyabravanel @realDonaldTrump Also even CNN and MSN acknowledge he's kept an enormous amount of campaign promises, and in that regard consider him the most honest President. Trump wrote a book on using hyperbole to influence results, so if he exaggerates his crowd size you know why he's doing it. Transparency<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lili1416 @pattysboi1 @lesleyabravanel @realDonaldTrump Policy wise he's been tougher on China and Russia than anyone. His strategy of showing dictators respect but going hard against them on policy has clearly worked, so future Presidents will have to be held to that standard if they don't follow his example and their policies fail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lili1416 @pattysboi1 @lesleyabravanel @realDonaldTrump Lili can you explain briefly why you believe Trump is a bad person? It's pretty obvious from your tweets that you are judging him on some sort of moral level, as opposed to a difference in political ideology.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cernovich @AlisonMorrisNOW Remember @scottadamssays 48 hour rule Mike. She apologized quickly and is trying to not be hurtful to anyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lili1416 @pattysboi1 @lesleyabravanel @realDonaldTrump I read the transcript. Trump asked for an investigation and Dems acknowledge it's a legitimate concern. The only thing Trump has claimed is that the Biden/Burisma connection may be problematic. Beyond that, Dems are just trying to mind read Trump's motives and assume they are bad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Trump truly believes in private that Biden would be the easiest person to beat. This goes against the Democratic narrative that Trump thinks he needs to cheat in order to beat him üòÇ<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lili1416 @pattysboi1 @lesleyabravanel @realDonaldTrump Its true. Biden's polling to be the next President. By resisting an investigation into the Biden/Burisma connection &amp; whether or not he has conflicts of interest w/ Ukraine Democrats are showing they don't give a rat's ass if the President is a Putin puppet so long as he's a Dem.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Cernovich @realDonaldTrump For real!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pattysboi1 @lesleyabravanel @realDonaldTrump Just catching YOU up on what happened in the House precedings in case you missed it. Dems agree the Biden/Burisma connection is worthy of investigation. If YOU don't care if the man polling to be the next Prez is controlled by Ukraine that's weird.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkDonner13 @flossy_nash @lesleyabravanel @realDonaldTrump He's never been accused of a single crime before üòÇ It's the dem's house witnesses that they called who acknowledged the Biden/Burisma connection is a legitimate issue to investigate. If YOU don't care if the man polling to be the next Prez is controlled by Ukraine that's weird.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Credibility matters. Schiff has none.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChidiNwatu @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Neither one are. The Senate won't convict because Dems agree the Biden/Burisma connection is worth looking into.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bromo999 @realDonaldTrump So...you think the press hasn't created Trump Derangement Syndrome? Of course they have!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RiskyLiberal @realDonaldTrump If we get a Republican female in the job she'll have to, just like Don. Fair treatment in the press does not exist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@flossy_nash @lesleyabravanel @realDonaldTrump He's not impeached unless the Senate convicts, which they'll never do because Democrats agree that the Biden/Burisma connection is worth looking into.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lesleyabravanel @realDonaldTrump He's never been accused of a crime. The Democrat's star witness readily admits under oath that the Biden/Burisma connection is worth looking into. Democrats agree with Trump but can't ever admit it üòÇ<|endoftext|>
