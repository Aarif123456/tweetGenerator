<|startoftext|>@leeflvres @DJThistle01 @AOC Agree. I don’t think governments are perfect and should do a shit load more to help. I meant in relation to the above, where it was implied Canadian gov shouldn’t support their people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DJThistle01 @AOC $2K a month would barely cover living in any major city in the US. Really the question should be, why the hell don’t these big organizations actually pay people a decent wage? Don’t blame the governments helping people.

<|startoftext|>@Ange_Amene At her very least, Hillary is as centrist as Joe. But she was a more progressive, who tried to push universal healthcare among others &amp; got shut down. Maliciously.

<|startoftext|>@politicalseason @PostEverything I get your point. I’ve thought about that but honestly I think she could easily learn enough. Obama didn’t have a ton of experience either. Either way it’ll be hard. But I think Harris/Warren would be better suited to the cabinet (AG/SoT) than VP, or strong voices in the senate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PostEverything Love Warren. But no. Abrams. She’s young, incredibly charismatic and smart, a new generation of Dem, a southern Black woman, and from a state with TWO senatorial elections. The turn out may be grand. #AbramsforVeep  Maybe cabinet, but Harris &amp; Warren are needed in the Senate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Malala @lmhoxford @UniofOxford Something peculiar about the folks on this thread (read: men) who are demanding this young woman now “earns” her Nobel Prize, and also stop being “hypocritical about food waste” (or something…?!)

<|startoftext|>@kima_alicia Totally fair. Won’t pretend I know details. Just tired of people who, unlike you offering points on inconsistencies, immediately say “she’s lying” w/o reason other than TrumpvBiden. So far… I think something happened; she deserves to be taken somewhat seriously to get the truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tired of hypocritical, so-called #Progressives. If she lied it'll come out. But you made your minds up to… what, protect one old white man due to the #RapistInChief? FYI you don't have to choose one. Perhaps try picking a candidate who doesn't assault people! Maybe a woman🤷🏻‍♂️ /7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #TaraReade interview with @megynkelly… first, I think Kelly did a good job. Hard Q's, without fluff. And I'm not a Kelly fan. At all. I'm also not a body language expert, but watching that interview… #Reade came across as believable. Sorry, but I can't say she's a liar. /6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's also never forget women make up more than half of the voters IN the damn party 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️ Did it with @HillaryClinton, with @KamalaHarris, with @ewarren… @TheDemocrats seem to hate women as much as any other organization/person. /5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fact people don't want to disavow @JoeBiden because of @realDonaldTrump (understandably) is fair. But MAYBE instead of nominating a man with questionable politics, @TheDemocrats could nominate a woman who, y'know, hasn't assaulted anyone? /4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Women deserve to be believed, not ridiculed or punished for speaking. Especially important given the system is designed to protect men/assaulters. Critique parts of #TaraReade's account, sure, but to discredit her absolutely without reason? I can't understand that. /3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There was no hard proof for #ChristineBlaseyFord or @ejeancarroll either. But they deserved to be heard &amp; their side believed. That's what #BelieveWomen means (to me, anyway); not to absolutely think the woman is 100% right, but that her side should be heard &amp; taken seriously. /2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Honestly struggling to understand how so many "progressives" are absolutely refuting #TaraReade without  evidence. Are some of her points questionable? Yes. Of course. But when has sexual harassment/assault ever been  an easy thing to prove? /1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid Abrams puts South in play. Warren should be in the Cabinet or Sen Maj Leader. Harris as a potential AG. Plus she seems to turn off too many and Biden is problematic enough. Also those who keep saying Abrams doesn’t have the experience — Obama only had 4 years in Fed Gov.<|endoftext|>

Not sure who you’re talking to here   And when Trump and the GOP cause more destruction to the planet, take healthcare away, more people die, lose jobs, can’t afford to live in a world not designed by them… I hope you’ll be happy with your stand<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keyser_Joze @LouisaCornell @ewarren True. But “no change” is much better than “let’s see how much worse we can make things” A second trump term would be catastrophic. He took the first 2 years seeing how far he could push. Now he has a team of sycophants. Biden was one of my last choices. But I pick him over Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keyser_Joze @LouisaCornell @ewarren Clever comeback from the person who thinks Trump is better than Biden. You don’t have to like Biden or Clinton but assuming things would be worse under them shows a level of ignorant privilege &amp; a lack of compassion for others. Doesn’t mean they’re the best, but better is better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keyser_Joze @Red__son @LouisaCornell @ewarren Legalizing marijuana and ending wars doesn’t end capitalism. If anything legalizing marijuana only adds to capitalism. Either way none of that extra money would go into Black communities unless it was specifically directed and history tells us that isn’t ever a guarantee.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keyser_Joze @Red__son @LouisaCornell @ewarren Are they good ideas? Of course. But will the jobs go to Black &amp; Brown people? History tells us that isn’t likely. “Legalizing marijuana” on its own doesn’t create social equality. Stopping wars - other than not needing BIPOC to enlist - also doesn’t help US social injustice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keyser_Joze @Red__son @LouisaCornell @ewarren As someone who likes Bernie I had to read the details myself. He‘s not good at explaining them. To a lot of Dems, ideas aren’t enough; need to know how to implement. Whether you like it or not, not everything is a conspiracy against him. He had 3 years &amp; should’ve worked harder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keyser_Joze @Red__son @LouisaCornell @ewarren And I’m sorry but the MSM didn’t smear him. They don’t love him but there is a difference in the terminology. But given how much we all talk about media changing from traditional outlets, why wasn’t Bernie ignoring the MSM &amp; delivering in other ways to discuss his policies?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keyser_Joze @Red__son @LouisaCornell @ewarren ...“normalcy”. But for some reason that meant I’m a Biden die hard?! I don’t want “normal”, I want change. This isn’t about me but well done on jumping into attacks which ignore the point of the discussion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keyser_Joze @Red__son @LouisaCornell @ewarren …are you surprised the communities who get screwed over the most are over cautious? Bernie should have spent more time in Black communities, asking their needs. M4A can’t fix racism in healthcare. Changing where the money goes won’t guarantee Black &amp; Brown people get jobs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keyser_Joze @Red__son @LouisaCornell @ewarren Clyburn has known Biden forever and so trusts him. I don’t get. But that’s up to him. You’re also discounting the MSM who kept questioning why Black folks were supporting Biden in large numbers when his platform doesn’t do enough either. But given how fucked it ended in 2016…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keyser_Joze @Red__son @LouisaCornell @ewarren Bernie’s problem is he doesn’t address the issues beyond class. Yes all his policies would help. But they don’t close that gap between races or genders. He was asked on stage about Black trans women being murdered and his response was income equality and M4A. He didn’t do enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keyser_Joze @Red__son @LouisaCornell @ewarren You ask what he could have done to earn the older Black vote… that’s something he should have figured out. He’s been running since November 2016. That group was one of his largest losses and he didn’t do enough to win them over. He also didn’t encourage a larger youth turn out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keyser_Joze @Red__son @LouisaCornell @ewarren You’re assuming the Black voter is single minded &amp; blindly does as Black leaders say. Your statement implies Black Americans lack independent thought. No I’m not for Biden; Bernie after Warren. I’m disappointed, but can see what’s what: he needed to work &amp; engage more.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@deanergal @JasonOverstreet Bernie is not a great debater at all. But he is consistent… so consistent that every answer is M4A and structural change… I just wish Warren stayed in a little longer to debate one last time and show how capable she is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@deanergal @JasonOverstreet I don’t disagree with this at all. My point is just, will the excitement still be there behind Biden when he will in all likelihood flub lines, mess up policy and fact points etc. He’ll have more attention and time which could make it worse.<|endoftext|>

By excluding *specific* policies to address the centuries of harm against Black people, non Christians, Trans folk, women… it shows where your focus lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonOverstreet I think the next debate will direct. Biden had a downturn in part because he’s bad on stage.

<|startoftext|>@birdiejane23 @MsPackyetti As a fellow T1D I won’t pretend it’s easy, but it makes you so much smarter than other people. We get to know our bodies better, become more in tune with it, and we actively have to learn more about nutrition. A positive is being smarter than most of my peers on these topics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So yeah. Based on being a #WarrenDemocrat, and everything she believes in, everything she will continue to fight for… it’s gotta be #Bernie.  He just has to pick a fucking knock-em-out VP.  #LFG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do worry about Congress more with Bernie. I don’t see data that says he’ll carry down ballots. But saying that… Given what happened to Clinton I’m not convinced Biden will do it. And I hate the idea that 4 years has only now woken people up. Why weren’t you awake before?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m also concerned with Biden’s ability to deliver. The way he flubbed the Declaration line to “you know the thing” 🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t hate #Biden but… can you honestly see him doing well against Trump? It’ll get messy and Trump is a fuck, but he’s been doing messy for decades. It’s where he lives. Biden isn’t good at debating either. Whereas Clinton destroyed him, Biden will make him look capable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Like… the only logical option is #WarrenToBernie. I can understand the concern; whether people want to agree or not, there is a division. I don’t know if it’s as big as Twitter makes it seem or not. We’ll only know when we’re confronted. But on the policies… it’s pretty clear.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@filsdelucie1 @nhannahjones My point: it’s always been about gender. America hates women. Post civil war former slave owners &amp; other elitist white men gave formerly enslaved Black men the vote 50+ yrs before their wives &amp; 100yrs before Black women. Political &amp; public mindsets hate the idea of women leading.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ewarren is most likely the greatest presidential candidate in US history.

<|startoftext|>@filsdelucie1 @nhannahjones Women were prevented from voting for the 1st 100+ years of US; another 50 before Black &amp; Brown women vote.

<|startoftext|>@PorkchopNorth @buckysrevenge28 @FredTJoseph @Fiorella_im @AOC 1/ again were you in the room? 2/ point still stands; he asked for SDs to support him, not just his states, to overtake the broad will of the people who voted Clinton 3/ point still stands; he was never ineffective.

<|startoftext|>My favorite “hate Warren” stance from Bernie fans is how she “lied” about Bernie saying a woman couldn’t win. I love how they were all in the room with Warren and Bernie.  Love how some will start saying he was right😒<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PorkchopNorth @buckysrevenge28 @FredTJoseph @Fiorella_im @AOC 1/ were you in the room? 2/ Bernie pushed for SD help in ‘16 at the end &amp; then helped w/ rule change in ‘18. 3/ Bernie has amendments but no big pieces. He’s stood against important bills. But numbers (bills+amendments) show Warren is catching up after 8 years. So…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bolles_ghost @buckysrevenge28 @FredTJoseph @Fiorella_im @AOC I was asking for specifics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@idkanymore1000 @buckysrevenge28 @FredTJoseph @Fiorella_im @AOC And you were there?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joshlikesblue @Chris_H_Politic @cmclymer Agree he’s problematic; I’d rather he retired. But some of those items are old. People can change. Eg was the first in the federal gov* to be pro gay marriage, before Obama.  But if you think the US is better under Trump???  *talking about the executive branch FYI. Not Congress.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@buckysrevenge28 @FredTJoseph @Fiorella_im @AOC When did she attack him?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunking @maddow I’m sorry, who are you and why are you here?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FRIGIDWORLD @MckJensen1 @AntiheroCepero @holmesieholmes @Han_Ianley @marwilliamson I mean… it’s a talent. I’m still impressed. Like. To say so much and nothing is hard.  Maybe he learned those languages so he would have even more words to use…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JulieRowanZoch @teddy_cat1 @MsPackyetti @E_iversonii I did research her. I’m still impressed. “She was a Republican” - yes. A former non active republican who went and built the CFPB before getting into politics and working to fight for working people. WHAT A SHAM!  And yes. Gay people CAN be homophobic just as women misogynist.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chris_H_Politic @cmclymer You’re not progressive if you go down the #BernieOrBust or #NeverBernie route. If you’re “progressive” principle is to allow Trump 4 more over any Democrat, then you’re blinded by your own privilege. Fight for the candidate you want; then make sure Trump doesn’t win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AntiheroCepero @MckJensen1 @holmesieholmes @Han_Ianley @marwilliamson I don’t even know what you’re arguing. If Bernie can’t win a primary (note: he hasn’t lost this one) then you don’t know if he’d win a GE? It’s all unlikely until the EC is removed.  I don’t think it’s a sure thing Biden or Bernie will beat Trump. Both are divisive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FRIGIDWORLD @MckJensen1 @AntiheroCepero @holmesieholmes @Han_Ianley @marwilliamson When the same thing happened after NV for Bernie.  I don’t think Bernie or Biden will easily beat Trump. Both inspire some but not others. Warren of the last lot was the only one who could have but misogynist erasure saw to that.  Or Pete, because he didn’t actually say anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FRIGIDWORLD @MckJensen1 @AntiheroCepero @holmesieholmes @Han_Ianley @marwilliamson They praised him for over performing. I’m no fan of Biden; yes he had benefits but the story was how far he fell. He destroyed SC which catapulted him. The problem is the 3 days between. No time to process. But you can’t blame them for stating how great his win was on Sat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mikel_Jollett If anything he should endorse her.  For the simple fact that she’s a better candidate, with real plans, who has a track record of getting things done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wallytwotone @cmclymer I’m sorry which election did Bernie win…? He lost in 2016 and hasn’t yet won in 2020. You’re acting like he’s already down and out instead of taking the campaign to the next level. This is garbage tweeting. Biden had a good night. Congratulate and fight tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YNB Both not surprised and totally disgusted.  America hates women. That’s all I’ll be saying until I see a woman in the White House.  America hates women.  ((Actually, should be *Democrats hate women. Unless you have the brand of HRC it’s damn near impossible to be elevated.))<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@miles_k My question: he wins nomination, selects VP, then something happens… I won’t say out loud. Who takes over? Unvetted VP? Second primary challenger?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissDonnaMeagle @OhNoElmo @JillFilipovic This is the tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MckJensen1 @AntiheroCepero @holmesieholmes @Han_Ianley @marwilliamson Also media coverage has been focused on Buttigieg, Bloomberg &amp; Bernie of late. Not Biden. He was the fallen candidate and the stakes were enormous for him in SC. More of the same “DNC stole it for HRC” by somehow hiding away 4m votes 🤦🏻‍♂️ Jesus lord give over with yourselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MckJensen1 @AntiheroCepero @holmesieholmes @Han_Ianley @marwilliamson On what planet were Buttigieg or Klobuchar or Beto going to endorse Bernie? They’re allowed to endorse whomever they want. Honestly just so tired of this bull. You realize your own rhetoric just asks all Democrats to hand Bernie the nomination, right? *That* would be a coup.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@teddy_cat1 @JulieRowanZoch @MsPackyetti @E_iversonii Because Warren is better than Bernie in every conceivable measure; aligned on basically everything with plans and receipts to get it done…  but the level of misogyny, ever embraced by white women, is rampant as ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FredTJoseph America👏🏼Hates👏🏼Women👏🏼 The only time America likes women is when they’re delicate, when they’re being a mother, when they’re supporting a man. Regardless of race, sexuality, religion… America👏🏼Hates👏🏼Women👏🏼 #WarrenIsMyPresident<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Personally couldn’t give a fuck who wins after Warren is out. Blue is blue. Bernie won’t get anything passed and Biden is fucking Biden. #SuperTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let’s be super fucking clear: #AmericaHatesWomen. The sheer misogyny involved when the smartest most prepared and capable candidate happens to be a woman, American Democrats turn around and look instead for old white men. #WarrenForAmerica #FuckThePatriarchy #SuperTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listening to @JoeBiden in Dallas last night… honestly sounded like a nomination acceptance rather than a regular rally. It was… awkwardly inspired. His endorsers are definitely better at selling his message than Joe himself though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CroughEdward @LeftwardSwing @Cal_Zero01 @AOC @BernieSanders I think most of human history suggests we’ve always voted based on gender…?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YNB @ewarren This is 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 The truest of truths here today<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ange_Amene My favorite thing about this is his rationale for getting anything and everything passed is the giant sweeping mandate of a revolution who will turn out… which is clearly happening in the south and represents a large portion of the vote 🤦🏻‍♂️🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anthonyzenkus @TrumpKennels @JobModeSD @EclecticRadical @AngryBlackLady You’re honestly just arguing for arguments sake.  Warren is better on climate and how to get the shit done before the world eats us. Science says so. Scientists say so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anthonyzenkus @TrumpKennels @JobModeSD @EclecticRadical @AngryBlackLady A plane crashes; we improve the safety not rid ourselves of planes.  No one likes nuclear power but IN👏🏼OUR👏🏼CURRENT👏🏼MOMENT👏🏼 where people need, yknow, energy &amp; we need to change everything 20 yrs ago, you push forward, not down then up. Otherwise you’re gonna kill more people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anthonyzenkus @TrumpKennels @JobModeSD @EclecticRadical @AngryBlackLady Bernie is very good on climate but he isn’t the best. Some scientists have said Biden/Buttigieg etc might be faster than Bernie whose plans may slow efforts. And again. If the policy director behind GND which Bernie supports is in turn endorsing Warren…?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anthonyzenkus @TrumpKennels @JobModeSD @EclecticRadical @AngryBlackLady Private co’s understand incentives as a reason to do anything more than trying to convince them with data. It is the smartest &amp; fastest way to get forprofit co’s working with you, as is seen in many already. This can be pushed internationally for imports and beyond.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anthonyzenkus @TrumpKennels @JobModeSD @EclecticRadical @AngryBlackLady Bernie is also not endorsing carbon pricing this time, which taxes private companies. You can write into law to make this beneficial for working people so prices aren’t places on consumers, but to remain silent on it is crazy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anthonyzenkus @TrumpKennels @JobModeSD @EclecticRadical @AngryBlackLady Again - we are in a massive fight with a climate catastrophe. Coal and oil are the worst things to use for at the moment. Nuclear predominantly gives off steam. Why get rid of one of the non emission sources when you’re in a fight for the planet as we know it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anthonyzenkus @TrumpKennels @JobModeSD @EclecticRadical @AngryBlackLady If we had 50 years then that makes sense. But we don’t. Practical solutions with the most impact are the way forward. If you don’t believe, see Germany who eradicated nuclear power and then upped fossil fuel use, using coal to make up the deficit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anthonyzenkus @TrumpKennels @JobModeSD @EclecticRadical @AngryBlackLady Yes, there are problems with nuclear, but if you want to net zero emissions then nuclear power which makes up 20% (from a total of 38%) of renewable energy in the US, needs to be part of it otherwise you’re going to make the struggle even harder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anthonyzenkus @TrumpKennels @JobModeSD @EclecticRadical @AngryBlackLady He’s against carbon capture tech which is one of the most vital ways to reverse the issue, not just combat it. He also wants to stop nuclear waste when all the science says it’s preferable to Fossil Fuels *in terms of climate*.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anthonyzenkus @TrumpKennels @JobModeSD @EclecticRadical @AngryBlackLady This is incorrect to say given the GND writer who worked with AOC endorses Warren and the scientist behind #BlueNewDeal is also behind Warren. Not to mention other scientists. There are also gaps in Bernie’s plan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jprunty_2011 @KGisWriting @ailee_may @DylanFMackinnon @franklinleonard Warren makes sense as he wants a VP on his wavelength given that - with all respect - he‘s 78 with a recent heart attack. Being POTUS is more stressful than campaigning. His choice will mean more than perhaps any VP pick. But he may go younger &amp; use Warren in the cabinet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MsPackyetti Please<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeeTwoCents @DCPofficial I want this as my ringtone and then I want all the cold callers to hit me up hourly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PushaCee @MsPackyetti @MsPackyetti is a MF GODDESS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anthonyzenkus @TrumpKennels @JobModeSD @EclecticRadical @AngryBlackLady If you put everything down to M4A then there’s no point in even having the discussion. And in doing that you’re literally digging into the division.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anthonyzenkus @TrumpKennels @JobModeSD @EclecticRadical @AngryBlackLady But to assume Bernie’s bill passes when a majority of Dem senators thus far aren’t aligned is ignorant. If he can do it then that’ll be fucking amazing. But whether you like it or not, he is divisive, &amp; any change to healthcare will always be divisive &amp; contentious because: FOX.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anthonyzenkus @TrumpKennels @JobModeSD @EclecticRadical @AngryBlackLady Maybe, as annoying as it would be, an option is the next best step. Get people onside. Convince them with product instead of rhetoric. Then you push for full coverage as soon as possible. It’s gonna take time either way to convince Congress &amp; the people. Who knows what’ll happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anthonyzenkus @TrumpKennels @JobModeSD @EclecticRadical @AngryBlackLady Compromise is bad when the integrity of the is ruined. Compromise with the other factions is literally governance. Unless you want one group of the left to have total rule over the whole country? Obama wanted public option. He took the win he could get. People now love ACA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anthonyzenkus @TrumpKennels @JobModeSD @EclecticRadical @AngryBlackLady I also cannot get the anger at compromise. You realize no candidate will win a majority of Americans. So you have to compromise. No candidate will sweep the House &amp; Senate to ensure something is passed in full, and for M4A you would need a super majority of far left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anthonyzenkus @TrumpKennels @JobModeSD @EclecticRadical @AngryBlackLady It’s like you don’t know how Congress works. POTUS gets to hand them a bill, you don’t think they’ll amend it, rework it? If you think M4A passes as it is in the first 100 days then frankly y’all are gonna be disappointed. Even AOC has acknowledged this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anthonyzenkus @TrumpKennels @JobModeSD @EclecticRadical @AngryBlackLady She had Bernie’s plan. He too didn’t have a lot about it, hence the questions. Maybe that’s when she thought there could be a better route? Jesus… I cannot fathom the Bernie fandom attacking Warren when they are ideologically similar &amp; silent on the Buttigieges of the race.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anthonyzenkus @TrumpKennels @JobModeSD @EclecticRadical @AngryBlackLady How is it a lie? The outcome is the same. And maybe she didn’t want to tax people when she could find another route? Why is that bad? Also: let’s not forget that in the early debates it was Warren, not Bernie, who took most of the blowback while Bernie remained relatively silent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anthonyzenkus @TrumpKennels @JobModeSD @EclecticRadical @AngryBlackLady Yes but unlike the other ones (which let’s be honest aren’t funded for the potential of 100M+ choosing M4A) EWs has a sunset. It’s there as a taster to show people it’s for the best so when she fights for full cover there’s evidential &amp; anecdotal backing instead of just the idea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anthonyzenkus @TrumpKennels @JobModeSD @EclecticRadical @AngryBlackLady This is another issue point for me. “Bernie is the boldest” - he &amp; Warren are so close with similar outcomes. For me, hers is more realistic with the plain how she’ll do it; a teacher &amp; a policy nut. Let’s talk execution, not the ideas as that fosters the “betterism” of it all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anthonyzenkus @TrumpKennels @JobModeSD @EclecticRadical @AngryBlackLady First, it’s not racist. Jewish isn’t a race. Anti Semitic, yes. Let’s get the words right or it lets those who are discriminatory more space. Second, I don’t mind his passion. My only issue is he’s allowed to show it while EW is deemed nasty for simply pointing out facts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dzennon Daddy Zennon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mikel_Jollett Always Bruce<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anthonyzenkus @TrumpKennels @JobModeSD @EclecticRadical @AngryBlackLady Is he authentic? Yes. Is he engaging? Absolutely. Do I believe he’ll fight for the plans he has? Of course! Do I think he’ll struggle to get it done before first term? Definitely.  Bernie is the poetry; Warren is the prose.  We all know how governing is done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anthonyzenkus @TrumpKennels @JobModeSD @EclecticRadical @AngryBlackLady Bernie himself says he’ll passed M4A through revolutionary mandate (forgetting POTUS isn’t technically supposed to dictate the legislature) and if it fails he’ll drop AF1 in Kentucky and hold rallies against McConnell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anthonyzenkus @TrumpKennels @JobModeSD @EclecticRadical @AngryBlackLady  https://t.co/jiP90s5Rhp Pretty well laid out here. But the fact there’s so much infighting between EW &amp; BS M4A plans is bull. The fact they both want it should be a uniting stance. Both options take time to implement. Will be a struggle. But honestly, hers is the most likely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anthonyzenkus @TrumpKennels @JobModeSD @EclecticRadical @AngryBlackLady Warren’s plan starts with the most expansive option preventing GOP veto within first 100 days. She then fights for full M4A after 2yrs. If midterms flips congress: option will still be there.  Bernie’s takes ≈4yrs? &amp; needs 60votes in senate unless he pushes to remove filibuster.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustinianRyan @FredTJoseph Just to be clear, it was a panel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustinianRyan @FredTJoseph You think all the people who were part of the discussion are anti-Bernie? The writer acknowledged their own dislike of Pete. It’s not scientific, but neither is racism. So I dunno. You’re not wrong btw. This isn’t a disagreement. I just think there’re a lot of variables.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MsPackyetti YOU NEED YOUR OWN SHOW Please and thanks @MSNBC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FredTJoseph Surprised Bernie is that low.  And also not surprised.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Theophania333 @KareemBanks6 @FredTJoseph Sorry, for Kareem 🤦🏻‍♂️ thought I hit the correct reply button<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listening to @DanCrenshawTX on @camanpour…   Turns out the congressman is filled with absolute bullshit, especially on the environment, &amp; should probably go speak to some climate scientists.  NB: not the scientists who are on the @GOP fossil fuel payroll. #Crenshaw #DanCrenshaw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let’s be clear: @realDonaldTrump chose @VP to head the #coronavirusus efforts so he can blame #Pence when it inevitably goes wrong. The #TrumpAdministration is inept. #Trump probably hopes it happens soon so he can replace Pence with @NikkiHaley on the @GOP ticket.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Styx666Official @ewarren Hi there, hello. Even if there was a 50 year low (there isn’t), that doesn’t mean the number of people dying by guns every single DAY is OK.

<|startoftext|>@niquealex @FredTJoseph @JoeBiden Did he say that?! I must have missed it because the debate was just a lot of noisy hot air<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’d probably say @ewarren for consistency and at least being able to get a point across. But none of them really did well. Four of them need to go. Now. #demdebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t think I could really name a winner. You could argue #Bernie didn’t fight back against the onslaught but given everyone, namely #MayorPete shouted over most of what he said, it’s hard to say he did fight back.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ugh @JoeBiden is fucking terrible. Seriously. He is pandering and no one is calling him out on it. “I want a black woman on the Supreme Court but I’ll do little actually for Black people”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fred_guttenberg @BernieSanders You say that… but I don’t think anyone is gaining points here. Biden is an angry old man, Amy is struggling to stay relevant, Pete is a pathetic tool with the smuggest look, Bloomberg is himself, Steyer is aggressive and irrelevant and Warren isn’t impacting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey moderators, can you please enforce the questions? @PeteButtigieg ending his answer on complex foreign policy issues so he can go back to the same #medicare debate where he actually knows not a lot.  #FuckOffPete #PeteButtigieg #GoHomePete #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ewarren’s response on the embassy in #Israel and #Palestine is honestly the best. “We shouldn’t get to decide”. Exactly. Push for a resolution between those two nations, and then set diplomatic placements accordingly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FredTJoseph “Aw shucks” white woman who likes repeating Republican talking points.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lewoofl @NumbersMuncher Warren is the smartest candidate by far and she and Bernie are the only ones who want to move the country forward. Klobuchar is terrible on policy and doesn’t want to address her own racist past. Not to mention Biden and Pete’s horrific problems which would turn off the far left.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Honestly this debate is making me like @BernieSanders more and more. And I was never a big fan. I preferred @HillaryClinton and currently prefer @ewarren but lord. He’s standing strong against all these baseless attacks from Pete Joe Amy Mike and Tom. #WarrenSanders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amyklobuchar tired of the “extremes” which includes half the democratic vote.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>150million people?? Is that real? That’s insane #Biden #DemDebate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YNB @FredTJoseph There’s nothing but madness going on right now. You’ll also notice that none of them are allowing Warren to really speak no doubt because they’re scared<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More than half of these people have never uttered the words “Black”, “African American” and “racism” so many times in their lives.  This is fucking awkward.  #DemDebate #SouthCarolina #DemocraticDebate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@doctor_eon @amaninacity @GOP You realize me saying I don’t fault this aspect of his rhetoric is not the same thing as wanting policies that can’t be paid for…? Dems are held to a higher standard by the media and even the voters and it’s frustrating especially when Dems overall try to help people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amaninacity @doctor_eon I don’t dispute that. I’ve many issues with Bernie. But the fact @GOP can pass a trillion$ tax cut without being directly asked how they pay for it, while healthcare etc is always questioned. I can’t fault that message. Of course I‘d then ask him how he’ll pass it and so on.🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Variety @MsPackyetti My favorite piece of music performed by my favorite artist. This is beautiful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid Eh… it’s a good ad. Until he mentions the legacy part which could be easily countered by Bernie. “Obama had a lot of good moments but most working people remained in the same place, things got more expensive… Obama was an inspiring figure but you can’t deposit that at the bank.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sonofhelldude @FredTJoseph @The_Acumen You won’t learn anything if you don’t do the work yourself. But I have nothing to prove to you or the lemmings following along in this ridiculous attempt of attacking the smartest candidate in the field. You’d just find something else to complain about. So peace be with you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nashwakay What about the other ones? I found one of them within ten minutes of googling. Comes with reviews from months ago. Unless of course that’s all part of the sham.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sonofhelldude @FredTJoseph @The_Acumen Why?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vvorkingclass @kima_alicia @RobinCSteel @FredTJoseph @VICE @vicenews Second, I googled one of the barbershops and found it within ten minutes. Includes reviews from months ago. But please continue with wanting this to be the big conspiracy you want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vvorkingclass @kima_alicia @RobinCSteel @FredTJoseph @VICE @vicenews If you actually pay attention you’ll see the address for the thrift store has a suite number. Meaning? Multiple units. You’ll also note that the Warren office ALSO has a suite number. CRAZY!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vvorkingclass @kima_alicia @RobinCSteel @FredTJoseph @VICE @vicenews Hi. You should try google instead of Bot-trolling. Because you’re really bad at it. First, the same address is a dominos pizza, and also a cancer thrift store.  https://t.co/Dh7ZeLFZxm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doctor_eon And I agree that his lack of an answer on that is bad. He should lay it out more. I just meant I don’t think what he’s saying is wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doctor_eon I was talking more about the principle of it though. Helping Americans takes a lot more negotiation while dropping bombs (yes, I simplified it) just gets a nod. It should all be accounted for, it’s the priority that bothers me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PierceAH66 @notcapnamerica I noted that too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@doctor_eon I actually agree with him. Should he make it clear? Yes. But when you’re spending that much money on military and war efforts without second thought, why not flip it and spend that much on healthcare?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@USPoliticsPoll @Amy_Siskind This is worrying. Biden+Klobuchar+Buttigieg &gt; Warren+Bernie  Three states so… calm down, but still.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benyc @marwilliamson @SenSanders @AveriHarper Lol honestly the funniest thing about this is Bernie said he doesn’t tolerate bullshit. Watch how he interacts with Steyer who actually has topics to discuss!  Williamson… I can feel Bernie breathing very calmly, forcing that smile, hiding from the crystals…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ryanstruyk Enjoying all of the folks, Bernie’s, Pete’s namely, that Warren is doing terribly on the national level and fading fast. Is it an uphill climb? Yes. Are we up for that fight?! Yes. #LetsFuckingGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckRoss33 @PDXMultipass @JasonOverstreet @ewarren And with that…  https://t.co/edylkVhbZA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckRoss33 @PDXMultipass @JasonOverstreet @ewarren And let’s not forget you ignored my point of Bernie trying to overturn the will of the voters. I agree he has a right to speak to and fight for the SDs. But you don’t get to come back 4 years later and lambast others for POTENTIALLY doing what you already did. It’s nonsense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckRoss33 @PDXMultipass @JasonOverstreet @ewarren The numbers do not suggest 4m people turned out for those caucuses. That would be 50% of WA’s/100% of NV’s population. Feel free to throw in dumb juice but I don’t just speak out of my ass. I look at the data.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckRoss33 @PDXMultipass @JasonOverstreet @ewarren Those are estimations, loose numbers. But ND &amp; WY are red states; IA &amp; ME are moderate. WA &amp; NV are high populous and blue(ish) states. So the %age of those turning out varies but in 2016 the average dem primaries pulled out 14.4% of voting aged people. Not registered, just 18+.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckRoss33 @PDXMultipass @JasonOverstreet @ewarren Dumb juice? Lord… ≈16m people (post ‘16 stats) in the 6 states. &gt;14% of eligible voters turn up in 2016; that’s &gt;5m voters if we’re being generous. To close the 4m gap, Sanders needed close to 100% of those caucuses. She won 2 of those contests.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rhinocerization Warren Abrams<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sonofhelldude @FredTJoseph @The_Acumen Only looks bad if you suck at search engines. It took me LITERALLY 10 minutes. Nothing to prove whatsoever.  And as I said. The name of one of them is in the fucking photos.  You don’t do this bot thing very well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sonofhelldude @FredTJoseph @The_Acumen Warren’s M4A is Bernie’s M4A. It’s a great bill. The execution is different. Bernie’s by the way will also take some years to implement ASSUMING!! he even gets it passed. Because taking AF1 to KY is not a great legislative move.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sonofhelldude @FredTJoseph @The_Acumen Ok boomer  https://t.co/Jt0WlPQ9qv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckRoss33 @PDXMultipass @JasonOverstreet @ewarren I’m tired of this purity veil Bernie gets even when it’s clearly not real and everyone else gets attacked for myopic details instead of the fucking policies helping people and who’s is best!  Jesus fucking Christ. DO BETTER.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckRoss33 @PDXMultipass @JasonOverstreet @ewarren And then to turn around now &amp; say the will of the people must be met!? If another candidate did that “flip flop” would be tagged to every ad, hypocrisy tied to everything they say. SDs CAN be fought for. The problem is he ignored his own principled stance he wants others to meet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckRoss33 @PDXMultipass @JasonOverstreet @ewarren You think 4m would‘ve voted for Bernie &amp; HRC would‘ve had zero in 6 states including ND &amp; WY? And again! Bernie said you to not erase the will of the people. If the majority voted for HRC then his principle says he shouldn’t erase that fact!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sonofhelldude @FredTJoseph @The_Acumen Also. The name of one of the shops is LITERALLY in the photos! If you’re going to try and troll someone at least do a good job of it. Like… seriously… Imagine demanding revolution all while focusing on the most ridiculous aspects.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sonofhelldude @FredTJoseph @The_Acumen Hello! I went to a place named Google - a search engine where you find info on history, people &amp; even places; would recommend! Anyway! I found a barbershop with the same wall art in @FredTJoseph’s pic. SO ODD! Crazy how all I did was type “Beaufort SC barbershops” and… 💥 Boom🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eugenegu @RichardEngel So I get where you’re coming from as language can change how people respond and can create violence. But isn’t this also a standard metaphor? Contextually; isn’t the Dr. also talking about the virus and not the people with it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kisssta12005 Agree w/ rank voting but not all at once. The concept is good as candidates with less money can build support. If all voted at once in 2008/16, HRC would have swept Obama &amp; Bernie. There needs time. Plus it prevents a Bloomberg. The order should be rotated though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckRoss33 @PDXMultipass @JasonOverstreet @ewarren 4m isn’t relevant… meaning the actual voters aren’t relevant? Bernie said “will of the people” on stage on Wed. My point is more voted for HRC and he wanted the SDs to switch to him. (Also caucuses are drastically undemocratic with lower turnout than primaries.)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoctorJonPaul Are these a modern version? Mine was… not this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoctorateTech @sarah_in_ny @JasonOverstreet @ewarren Look at recent polling. She’s on the up. A lot of the downfall was the media erasure.  But face it. You hate women. It’s OK. You can live your sad life. Peace be with you, sir Bot. ✌🏼✌🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckRoss33 @PDXMultipass @JasonOverstreet @ewarren Except when he was soliciting them they had already chosen Clinton along with 4m more voters. So… he would be going against the will of the people which is the complete antithesis of his entire platform.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckRoss33 @PDXMultipass @JasonOverstreet @ewarren Show me proof she lied about Bernie.  Not an opinion.  Proof.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarah_in_ny @DoctorateTech @JasonOverstreet @ewarren First her votes are less in favor of trump than Bernie’s; only Gillibrand voted fewer times. Second like… read your sentences. You clearly don’t understand misogyny as a concept 🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesharpfacet @RichardWyse @Hoopdata @FredTJoseph @ava @TeamWarren So ffs... calm your shit. The system though imperfect is designed to make the eventual winner stronger in the fall.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesharpfacet @RichardWyse @Hoopdata @FredTJoseph @ava @TeamWarren Plus it makes Bernie stronger if others stay in. They should attack him, not for his own practice, but so the media has less to bring up during the GE and all the shit Trump throws his way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesharpfacet @RichardWyse @Hoopdata @FredTJoseph @ava @TeamWarren After Super Tuesday, sure. Let’s have the discussion. But stop with the erasure of Warren when other candidates with less chance are still in. She’s surging at the moment, 2nd in California, and Biden is bouncing back. Not to mention Bloomberg hasn’t been a factor yet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesharpfacet @RichardWyse @Hoopdata @FredTJoseph @ava @TeamWarren Bernie lost 3 of the first 4 primaries in 2016 &amp; he didn’t drop out. In 1992 Bill Clinton lost the first 3 primaries and went on to win two terms.  Kerry &amp; McCain were also written off early on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesharpfacet @RichardWyse @Hoopdata @FredTJoseph @ava @TeamWarren Good Grief. 3 states! Are you serious? The polls changed lots the last year. So far Bernie will likely be the nominee. But that doesn’t mean others should leave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tcm This is incredible!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thesharpfacet @RichardWyse @Hoopdata @FredTJoseph @ava @TeamWarren  https://t.co/HjsWAf0GST<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChuckRoss33 @PDXMultipass @JasonOverstreet @ewarren First that analogy is… 🤦🏻‍♂️🙄 Second, a fact of life and part of the equation… like Super PACs and huge donations of money are in elections.…?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SamAronow @franklinleonard I mean when she was leading before it didn’t have much benefit to her media narrative then. Her being a woman running against well known men will always be an inhibitor, especially as a progressive woman.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonOverstreet @LisaTalmadge @Allifliss @angrygirlflours @ewarren That’s supposed to say NOT dumping money on the candidate 🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonOverstreet @LisaTalmadge @Allifliss @angrygirlflours @ewarren “Consistent in values”…did you watch 2016? He was against super delegates in the lead up before wanting their support to overturn the majority of voters. Now he wants them gone. Was it understandable? Of course! But stop pretending Bernie is a saint and everyone else is corrupt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonOverstreet @LisaTalmadge @Allifliss @angrygirlflours @ewarren Bernie accepts support from a political nonprofit which holds some some of its donors (those who donated 500k+). Persist works in the same way Our Revolution does; dumping money on the candidate but paying for ads and building ground games.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dzennon @treeaston Of course<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@franklinleonard Can’t unsee it!!  Was probably too focused on ensuring the message was filled with words while being as blank as the background it was typed on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottNicButler @SholaMos1 @BernieSanders How? Bernie‘s core support is angry at the system, hungry for change, and passionate about him. The point isn’t Trumpism; it’s about a movement not being taken seriously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteButtigieg Let’s stop with this bullshit? When America was a “beacon” to the world, America was far more misogynist, homomisic, trans people were never ever accepted, and racism &amp; xenophobia were pillars of society. So please. Stop looking back. It shows a clear misunderstanding of history.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoctorateTech @JasonOverstreet @sarah_in_ny @ewarren Actually I got bored. I showed her in good light and exposed your misogyny so…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Smiling_Janitor @retired_rebel @docrocktex26 I trust Rock Paper Scissors more. At least it involves people looking at each other trying to contemplate a move with a bare ounce of strategy.  Which is the grossest overstatement of RPS I have ever encountered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaroleMyers @CNN THIS 👆🏼👆🏼👆🏼 I hope someone puts Yang in their cabinet. Maybe interior and he can focus on modernization.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DWOBoyle @ava @ShankarFGC You can be both, but you can’t do the latter without beating Trump first. The point is this tweet specifically does add to the divisiveness already perpetuated on Bernie. His platform is great but in a GE I don’t see how he brings along everyone. This tweet doesn’t help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichardWyse @Hoopdata @FredTJoseph @ava @TeamWarren It’s very curious how so many Bernie supporters are the first ones to comment with few followers and odd profile pics…  I’m not calling you a bot… but I’m not not, y’know?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoctorateTech @JasonOverstreet @sarah_in_ny @ewarren Literally said about the heritage that she was wrong but she’s making efforts to deconstruct her racism there. And she’s been endorsed by indigenous people in congress, so… I think I’ll go with them over you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoctorateTech @JasonOverstreet @sarah_in_ny @ewarren I did. He hasn’t actually achieved that much. In fairness. No Senator is really able to. His words are inspiring, not his record.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoctorateTech @JasonOverstreet @sarah_in_ny @ewarren Lol see!!! I asked for proof and you showed me opinion. You hate her. Just say that. Stop pretending you need a reason to because all of your reasons are bullshit. Whether you’re real or a bot, you’re really bad at this. Like… really bad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoctorateTech @JasonOverstreet @sarah_in_ny @ewarren Factually incorrect. Is she near the top? No. But you could easily correlate that to progressive women with a voice being unliked. America hates women. You’ll disagree because misogynists believe being a woman is a political tool<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoctorateTech @JasonOverstreet @sarah_in_ny @ewarren How do you know she lied about Bernie? Legitimately: show me an actual fact, not an opinion. Lied about her plans? The only way you’d know that is if she was POTUS like… seriously learn to debate for God’s sake<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hoopdata @arnonmishkin @davesikora @ElectProject But he did allegedly talk up Warren at a private event  https://t.co/MmQ9gLS5OR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoctorateTech @JasonOverstreet @sarah_in_ny @ewarren Wow cool. That is important to her policies right now…?? Honestly if you have to go back 20 years to pull this to say she’s a conservative then you’re desperate. Bernie spent his younger years waiting to be a politician. If that was Warren you‘d be shouting it from the rooftops.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoctorateTech @JasonOverstreet @sarah_in_ny @ewarren But frankly, Bernie isn’t as good at execution. I love his ideas. But I don’t believe he’ll get most of it done. Warren? She’s more likely to make the hard choices like the filibuster to get progressive policy through.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoctorateTech @JasonOverstreet @sarah_in_ny @ewarren And she IS FOR M4A. Is her execution different? Yes. The bill is the same. Bernie’s would take around 4 years to implement like Warren’s, but she’s willing to make small changes if the Senate is still Republican or not progressive because it’s better than nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoctorateTech @JasonOverstreet @sarah_in_ny @ewarren The Native heritage thing? That was wrong. But she not just apologized but went to the Nations &amp; is working to make change. Is she completely forgiven? No. But she tries, and I don’t think she’d be endorsed by Native people if she was quite the racist you’re painting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoctorateTech @JasonOverstreet @sarah_in_ny @ewarren Everything about college/ job? Good fucking grief. Hearsay. You don’t know what happened, your agreeing with talking points.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoctorateTech @JasonOverstreet @sarah_in_ny @ewarren I don’t like the superpac but since money is needed and everyone including Bernie gets help from superpac/political nonprofits (who don’t disclose their high paying donors) then fine. She isn’t directly taking their money, &amp; isn’t disavowing a very small pac.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DoctorateTech @JasonOverstreet @sarah_in_ny @ewarren Slandered him when? You weren’t at the meeting. Only Bernie &amp; Warren know what happened. Kinda hard to confront him on stage &amp; say “you called me a liar on national tv”. Runs on being a woman? That is sexist. Some progressive you are. “Woman” is not a policy issue. It’s her life.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B__S_AF @JasonOverstreet @ewarren Like Bernie on Super delegates? 2015-16: no super delegates. Mid 2016: yes to super delegates if you support me. 2020: fuck the super delegates.  You can legit critique Warren on some things but these arguments are honestly just poor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arendtiana @JasonOverstreet @ewarren Lol like… what? Give up the power to the corporations she wants to keep in check? There are legit questions you can throw up but this is nonsense. Also, Bernie was for Super delegates in 2016 when he wanted them to support him so please. Don’t even with that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wxjay @JasonOverstreet @ewarren She can’t go after Sanders in the same way though. Bloomberg is problematic to death and an arrogant tool. Bernie is different. But this could be the new way of doing it. Not on the policy but the action.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PDXMultipass @JasonOverstreet @ewarren Everyone makes changes. Like Bernie, who flipped on Super Delegates. Twice. Is he the likely winner? Yes. But so was Clinton. Did he quit? No. Why? Change matters. Warren wants change too. She’s the best messenger in the party &amp; the smartest. Her voice is needed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RuekaA @hornbybrown @JasonOverstreet @ewarren Point: keep saying she was Republican when she wasn’t a politician. Literally doesn’t matter. She’s worked at the problems helped people, and was tasked to make big changes despite the huge pushback from lobbyists, bankers and Republicans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RuekaA @hornbybrown @JasonOverstreet @ewarren Like, she literally built a government agency that helps working people and would have been running it if the Republicans didn’t hate her so much. So she ran to sit with them in Congress taking down a popular R incumbent and continues to rip into them in the Senate chamber.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@copiedcopies @FascistsForPete @BeLikePete @PeteButtigieg Eh probably. But it’s Saturday night and I’m bored<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkylarBotson You mean it wasn’t valid in 2016?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FascistsForPete @BeLikePete @copiedcopies @PeteButtigieg … because you say so?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FascistsForPete @BeLikePete @copiedcopies @PeteButtigieg …you realize Trump isn’t on the primary ballots, right? Meaning, winning the counties that specifically matter to the general election in the primary doesn’t actually tell you anything. They could still go hard for Trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AJWalton11 @PeteButtigieg But I mean… he has double Gabbard! 🙈😂🙃  It’s honestly beautiful the uncommitted 3% beats Pete.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Believe it or not the process, theoretically anyway, is good by design and should be left to work it’s course. Let them win the hard way. All of them. They should all tough it out.   #Democrats #Primaries #Caucus #Bernie #Warren #Biden #DemocraticField #Democrats2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also it’s better for him. The others should be attacking #Bernie now so you reduce any &amp; all potential attacks from even mattering; “He’s a socialist? YES we know.” That way he can just talk about his platform &amp; ignore #Trump without needing to constantly respond.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also will never understand how #Bernie is played up as a victim on one hand and as the supreme winner on the other. If he wins then leave it to happen. What is the rush? There are 51(?) more #primaries to go.  (+ DC &amp; territories in case you’re wondering)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Bernie will likely win and great. But ffs you don’t get to decide when others drop out. Warren raised $14m since Wednesday. I think that means plenty of people want her in the race still. Her voice is important. #Pete has a strong following (no clue…) and #Biden is resurgent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ugh I’m just…  If #Bernie wins, great. I’d be happy. But honestly, it’s exhausting hearing “#Warren et al should drop out because 3 polls in and Bernie’s on lock…” Why wasn’t that a valid reason in 2016 when he ended with no route without super #delegates? #NevadaCaucus #Dems<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid Put it on the podcast please!!!!!!!!! I want to listen to it later but can’t watch at the moment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@asmamk If someone votes early and then decide they want to change their mind and show up to site in person, can they - caucusing in person - overrule their own early vote? I assume not as it’s probably on an unidentifiable ballot, but I was just wondering.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ladygrinning @cmclymer TBF, the entire concept of a republic is messy. No real democracies. The last 15+years of elections: Dems get more votes nationally (inc congressional) yet unequal # of seats. Similarly happens in European countries like UK in Dec. None of it is proportional, it’s geographical.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeoPolitical10 @BorBorja1 @lauriebidaho @JessResist @BaliJibril @kylegriffin1 Well now you’re just throwing out opinions as facts. Not the Bernie one. But I’m pretty sure Jackson, Buchanan, Nixon, Hoover, A.Johnson, Tyler and Pierce are far more hated through an historical lens. And Trump will be there too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bernieorbust13 @CJFinaducci @JoyAnnReid I hope it doesn’t count for ticket splitting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanLenwar @DuoVonOnly @justamadho @teresamarkos @THEPERFOURMER @Phil_Lewis_ This would be a perfect match!!!  Jones, not Saldana…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bernieorbust13 @CJFinaducci @JoyAnnReid *in NH they had more I mean. Or they matched him. I just don’t want it to be moderate vs progressive again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bernieorbust13 @CJFinaducci @JoyAnnReid I meant ticket splitting. Many Klobuchar, Biden and Pete voters are jumping around. Klob &amp; Pete won more votes collectively. That’s my worry. If they all drop out after today… would he still lead. I just want to make sure his message gets out and isn’t lost to his detriment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bernieorbust13 @CJFinaducci @JoyAnnReid He had the popularity in 2016 but never took the lead from Clinton. We can say the DNC fucked up but they didn’t turn 4m votes against him. I’m just nervous he wins the nomination but the moderates don’t join 😰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bernieorbust13 @CJFinaducci @JoyAnnReid Question: and this isn’t me trying to stick it as Warren &amp; Sanders are my tops. How is Bernie ensuring the moderates turn out? The left &amp; “vote blue” aren’t a big enough coalition. You also have to ask if it was only vs Biden or Pete, would Sanders still have the lead?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeoPolitical10 @BorBorja1 @lauriebidaho @JessResist @BaliJibril @kylegriffin1 Her campaign was actually more detailed. The problem is Trump was constantly covered &amp; most of her coverage was responding to him. She didn’t run a great campaign, true, but 3m more voted for her &amp; as well as apathy, voters, POC mainly, were prevented from voting including in WI.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wb_thorne @nuckles87 @OhioGanja @robyyynb @Chris_SactoCA @gillsterein @ShaneGoldmacher @PodSaveAmerica @jonfavs Do you have a source for this? Not trying to be argumentative, I’ve just never heard this. I was still under the assumption you had to stand there and speak without aid. Curious to see what’s happened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickPonticello Anyone who claims to be progressive but doesn’t is lying to themselves. This isn’t about Bernie’s policies, but about the threat of Trump. You cannot be progressive in any way if you allow Trump to gain four more years<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wb_thorne @nuckles87 @OhioGanja @robyyynb @Chris_SactoCA @gillsterein @ShaneGoldmacher @PodSaveAmerica @jonfavs Which is how the filibuster works…?  And a Republican can come in and stop something, assuming there are even 60 votes to start with. It needs to be a simple majority like the House.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_ZayBanks @nevinkohler @AvBronstein @JulianCastro @ewarren That argument doesn’t work. If she was taking money from huge super pacs then yes. But this one is small and not directly in her camp. The core points of her platform is the integrity I care about. Not whether an outside source wanted to ensure she’s heard after all the erasure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cmclymer Wait what?! I didn’t see this. I thought the month ago thing was something floating around on Twitter. Ugh… I like Bernie but this? Also why is the Q: “why do you think it came out now?” when it should be “Why didn’t you say anything a month ago?”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cowboywastoid I don’t care WHY though, &amp; Sanders should get all the support he can. Super PACs/politically active nonprofits are legal. I hope BS/EW end them when in office but that’s the playbook. Even if they are against the method they should do what they can since no one else will end it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cowboywastoid Actually she raised millions within hours of the LV debate, not because of Persist.  Can I can’t give you a reason why? No. But OR’s info says donors have given more than $500k donors, including those who wish to remain unnamed &amp; OR aren’t inclined to go against their wishes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eponawest Not in name, but it is a politically active nonprofit, working in very much the same way as a super pac, but with less rigidity on releasing donor info: “[OR] declined to identify its largest donors, saying it is respecting their wishes to remain private.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cowboywastoid @nathanielrobl @goncaloirl @davidabenner @NYforSanders @ShaneGoldmacher @PodSaveAmerica @jonfavs She didn’t go so broke. She still has money. And you realize the pac that supports him has questionable funding…    https://t.co/2tERO8AxBb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cowboywastoid @nathanielrobl @goncaloirl @davidabenner @NYforSanders @ShaneGoldmacher @PodSaveAmerica @jonfavs …it’s been two states. Also it’s better for Bernie if people stay in longer as he needs to be attacked in the primary so nothing Trump says will make a difference if he wins the nomination. While he’s good at deflecting nonsense thus far he isn’t winning over most moderate Dems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cowboywastoid @nathanielrobl @goncaloirl @davidabenner @NYforSanders @ShaneGoldmacher @PodSaveAmerica @jonfavs Also, yes she is getting super pac support. I don’t like it. But the fact is it’s expensive. She isn’t taking money, like another progressive candidate, but is getting the advertising support.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cowboywastoid @nathanielrobl @goncaloirl @davidabenner @NYforSanders @ShaneGoldmacher @PodSaveAmerica @jonfavs Happy to send the next link where Warren says early in her campaign that she wants to push to end the filibuster.  Also if you don’t think people can change their mind then I don’t know why you’re getting involved in politics or political discussions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cowboywastoid @nathanielrobl @goncaloirl @davidabenner @NYforSanders @ShaneGoldmacher Happy to send the @PodSaveAmerica link where @jonfavs, an advocate for ending the filibuster, tries to get BS to change his mind. Bernie says no, largely as he thinks he’ll get a super majority of voters who’ll convince the Senate 🙄. THAT shows a blindness to the Senate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nuckles87 @OhioGanja @robyyynb @Chris_SactoCA @gillsterein @ShaneGoldmacher Happy to send the @PodSaveAmerica link where @jonfavs, an advocate for ending the filibuster, tries to get BS to change his mind. Bernie says no, largely as he thinks he’ll get a super majority of voters who’ll convince the Senate 🙄. THAT shows a blindness to the Senate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattBruenig Her point is pushing to end the filibuster. The president, as we know, has influence. Sanders isn’t for it. While the filibuster is a safety net in Democratic off years, nothing big can happen with it in place. He offers great ideas, she offers actual solutions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kristin_thorp Haha I know 😅😅 I just wanted to join in as I cannot understand how most guys are comfortable with outdoor peeing. Or even urinals. I need a locked door and silence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrandinPhoto 4/ you like Bernie and won’t take anyone else, cool. Bernie has great ideas. But please don’t come here trying to say Warren was a Reagan stan when there’s no proof of any of that whatsoever. She’s where she needs to be and she’s doing the work as she always has.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrandinPhoto 3/  I don’t hold it against him because I actually respect those who can see things, admit they were wrong, and learn.  Warren learned by doing the work and seeing things as they are. Also safe to assume if she was a super conservative she wouldn’t be friends Bernie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrandinPhoto 2/ so what you’re saying is no to growth? Every single candidate has had to grow. Including Bernie who at one point was happy to leave gay marriage to the states, a Republican talking point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrandinPhoto Um, 1/ we read two different articles here. Those saying she was diehard conservative are not factual just anecdotal. Not to be discounted but to say that’s a “straight up fact” would get you thrown out of court.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kristin_thorp Not this guy. I want it private or not at all.   #shyurinator<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nilenurel @oldmanebro Yes I watched the debate. My points still stand. 1/ The delegates may not equal the most votes. See: Iowa.  2/ Bernie was anti super delegates until he needed them in 2016. Now he’s against them. I don’t fault him, I fault those making him a savior &amp; the others crooks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid @BernieSanders Maybe because Bernie is a thoughtful, intelligent leader and not mindless like the majority of leading republicans?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BorBorja1 @lauriebidaho @JessResist @BaliJibril @kylegriffin1 Tired of the “she should have campaigned in Michigan”. If she had she’d have been accused of not doing enough work in any purple/ish states like Georgia or Texas or Arizona. She tried a different hand. It didn’t work. She should have done more, but her idea wasn’t a bad one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nevinkohler @AvBronstein @JulianCastro @ewarren Bernie has a superpac. They can call themselves something different but they operate that way. Tired of the SP bull. They’re all playing that way so if it helps her I’m for it. “Lacks principles”, sure. But so does everyone. Including Bernie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leannevanderbyl @VashtiVale42 @ContrarySarie Castro is in my second choices. My first is always Abrams.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LucyHoneychurc6 @TorresDetroit @lenirtpls Neither is Bernie. Once again: unless they carry the senate and House with very left numbers they won’t get this done. Which is unlikely. His reasoning is nothing more than a ground swell. I want M4A now. But honestly if you can’t read the numbers as they are…?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MissDonnaMeagle @YounesRhazi @JulianCastro @ewarren As does Bernie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShelleDione @Quest3300 @JaxRosa @oldmanebro I used “bad” as I ran out of space. But she gets a constant dig. She wasn’t always leftist, nor a politician. But her book is broadly the same economic message, written by an academic, not a politician. Was she the OG? No, but she shouldn’t be written off for a different path.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nilenurel @oldmanebro This meme is very much out of context. For one, you can win the popular vote but not the delegates. The question was about delegates. Bernie said no because S-delegates shouldn’t decide. Fair. But in 2016 he tried to get SDs to change to him because he was the “better choice”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Quest3300 @ShelleDione @JaxRosa @oldmanebro Or she probably said she was because her family mostly was/is republican. She wasn’t exactly political. But people will say she voted for Reagan &amp; Bush like they were there. She was working towards the same goals then as now. She took a different route. That doesn’t make her bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MsPackyetti I woke up with a huge smile. Murder never looked so good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tdraicer @CJNWrites You can easily argue that Biden didn’t fuck up. But he didn’t do nearly enough. He faded the second hour. Yes the moderators didn’t give that chance but he should have just taken those chances like Warren did. She demanded her time and got it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bobbilfish1 @ProudResister Agree. I prefer Warren but I will say, she was given more time tonight. Pretty sure it’s NBC making up for the erasure in the polls this week. Happy for it. But that shouldn’t be the route.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeBloomberg - You were a politician for three terms in NY. - You are vying for the highest ranking political position and think you should be there without knowledge of the system? - Your views &amp; ideas were not good pre-debate and are embarrassing post.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Does nobody else think @BernieSanders’ answer on the online attacks - “see the POC women on my campaign getting attacked” - is really just another version of “Not racist - see my Black friend”?  No, not calling #Bernie a racist 🙄 But his answer here was awful.  #BernieSanders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Debate winner: Elizabeth Warren Close second: Bernie Sanders  Then: Everyone else because they didn’t get a chance   Bruised and busted: Michael Bloomberg  Flounderer: Amy Klobuchar<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bernie eh. He’s consistent so there’s nothing more to really say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@biden still attacking in his closer… did he not get enough chances 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KimDeBarge @BariAWilliams @theoaklandpanda I still don’t know why @JoyAnnReid isn’t on. The way she handles people on her show, checks their lies and states facts… nobody else on msnbc has that level of control.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@warren is my queen right now.  And she FINALLY made notice that she’s been a politician the shortest.  https://t.co/Ku5iVSnwQY<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteButtigieg same old same old closer. Airy comments. No substance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeBloomberg “job of a manager” well you made money but you fucked over people… government is not a business. Government is not a business. GOVERNMENT IS NOT A BUSINESS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amyklobuchar just makes the case for being a legislator, not an executor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ladygrinning @Lesdoggg @SenWarren I agree. But debates won’t matter if there aren’t any. Clinton won 3/3 and still lost the EC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@miles_k @ewarren I’ll be at the premiere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VilissaThompson Other than her lashings of Pete she hasn’t said anything different (I guess maybe the jokes..?) since the first debate. Since her announcement speech.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SenSanders is so much better at attacking billionaires when @Bloomberg is on stage. Has more than the bottom 125MILLION AMERICANS. That. Is. Absurd.  #bernie #demdebate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MikeBloomberg The most disturbing thing here is that this is a good ad. There are many less progressive Dems who will appreciate this and potentially (please don’t 🤦🏻‍♂️) vote for Bloomberg. Not sure what the remedy is. But Bernie needs to maybe sit for a 30min interview specifically about this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cal_gal53 @McFaul Your ignorance is disturbing<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BrianAtkinsonLA @rochelleriley @MsPackyetti @AlexWitt Bernie who when asked about the murders of Black trans people on a debate stage answered with income inequality and Medicare for all?

<|startoftext|>@Nate_Cohn @MsPackyetti This is disturbing. One has to ask whether it’s just this year mistakes were made, or is it a long time problem only revealed because of the extra date released. In conclusion - caucuses need to be banned, not just changed in Iowa.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AmandiOnAir @ewarren She got hounded for progressive policies whilst Bernie didn’t.

<|startoftext|>@StevenVevets @TheFreshTrumpet @AnitaM86 @leftistthot420 Actually a lot of us don’t support Pete &amp; think his candidacy is poor, not just policies.

<|startoftext|>@jeremyhofmann5 @ProudResister I’m sorry which of her policies is centrist?

<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid @BernieSanders @jeremycorbyn I get why people conflate the two, but one is a #DemocraticSocialist while the other is actually #Socialist. Neither are really unity candidates. At least at the moment. But Bernie is far more agreeable to a wider range of people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid @BernieSanders Big difference: @jeremycorbyn wasn’t a unity figure. He stuck to his principles, formed decades earlier in his career, and refused to adjust at all. He‘s also very unpopular even within Labour. @BernieSanders may be problematic to some, but he’s much more realistic today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeannRandall15 @Suzyw27936136 @willliamcalhoun @TuxedoBern @SusanRi7777777 @socalmd54 @DrJasonJohnson You realize this wasn’t about his policies bht the benefit of a Super PAC-styled group? Should mention none of you ever discuss her policies, just her. But there’s the double standard. If Warren had the l same support as Our Revolution, y’all would be calling her a snake again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeannRandall15 @Suzyw27936136 @willliamcalhoun @TuxedoBern @SusanRi7777777 @socalmd54 @DrJasonJohnson No. Once again one of the Bernie die-hards is reading “injustice” when there is none, playing victim without cause. Instead you call out a woman you don’t like because she dared to run against your Lord &amp; Savior. It’s honestly pathetic. Bernie is great; his fans, less so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeannRandall15 @Suzyw27936136 @willliamcalhoun @TuxedoBern @SusanRi7777777 @socalmd54 @DrJasonJohnson The point is he benefits from them &amp; we don’t know who donates yet. 2019 donations aren’t available until after November &amp; this year won’t be until later next year. I’m not saying she’s right but to call her disingenuous is incorrect when the basic, binary of the facts are there.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Suzyw27936136 @LeannRandall15 @willliamcalhoun @TuxedoBern @SusanRi7777777 @socalmd54 @DrJasonJohnson It’s not that simple. OR’s effectively a Super PAC. They don’t directly give Bernie $$ but he benefits from OR active support. Which is fine, but they do accept money from undisclosed donors, like a regular SP. Warren isn’t technically wrong, nor is she absolutely right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IdiosyncraticXL @MamoudouNDiaye I’m a big fan of PoNC and may just use that from now on to describe us. Or perhaps People of No Seasoning? 🙃<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Roctapus @MichaleneEdward @kiffkroker32 @BicFatty @KaivanShroff @joncoopertweets I agree it was really bad but wasn’t the point to prove it so Trump would donate money somewhere? I don’t think it was meant to be just “look at me”.  Also - Klobuchar does have baggage as a former prosecutor. She just hasn’t been scrutinized like Harris. Can’t imagine why…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MamoudouNDiaye @IdiosyncraticXL — did you see this? Thought you’d appreciate 😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrandonBeckham_ @realDonaldTrump @CNN @TeamTrump If you support Trump your perspective on Christianity is null &amp; void. He is antithetical to Jesus Christ. So… maybe go learn something. Regurgitating a few phrases from the Bible does not make a profound religious leader. It means you can divvy up quotes that suit sans context.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HarrisonLees @FatherLefty @TexasNewsHound @Pjevica @riotwomennn @JoyAnnReid Agreed. Also: just stop with the tech. Jesus Christ, paper is FINE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emccoy_writer @gracattack @PoochieVince I hope they drag but either way… I can’t remember who said this. It was way back in late 2016/early 2017 when people were worried after he suggested he wouldn’t hold the 2016 result as affirmative if he lost the EC. Will have to dig it up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarrisonLees @FatherLefty @TexasNewsHound @Pjevica @riotwomennn @JoyAnnReid Gonna stick with Warren until she’s no longer in. I think Bernie will be the nominee at this point. Although we haven’t come up against Bloomberg yet so… yeah. Who knows how that goes when he’s actually on the (metaphorical I hope) stage with the others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarrisonLees @FatherLefty @TexasNewsHound @Pjevica @riotwomennn @JoyAnnReid That’s what I hope. So many candidates maybe many just don’t want to choose and will vote in November no matter who. Plus caucuses are low level so hopefully that’s a factor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarrisonLees @FatherLefty @TexasNewsHound @Pjevica @riotwomennn @JoyAnnReid I do. I want Warren. Bernie is probably my second choice. Then Amy. But I see too often people shouting they won’t vote if Bernie is the nominee and won’t vote if he isn’t. I apologize; I read your comments as he wins or else. My bad. Twitter isn’t for easy communication 🤦🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PoochieVince @gracattack Heard someone say at some point if he loses then on the Secret Service would be obliged to escort him out as they won’t work for him. His term effectively expires on Jan 20 2021 @ noon. He has to be sworn in again to remain POTUS. So it might be cool to see him literally dragged!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarrisonLees @FatherLefty @TexasNewsHound @Pjevica @riotwomennn @JoyAnnReid No I dismissed the fact that bringing them out does not compensate the lack of overall voters. We need those Bernie brings out. But we need those who have disappeared. I didn’t suggest he lost them, but they have gone and if they don’t come back THAT is a worry for all of us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarrisonLees @FatherLefty @TexasNewsHound @Pjevica @riotwomennn @JoyAnnReid — but any are in fact 👍🏼 than Trump. If you disagree, we’re on two different plains &amp; you should vote for Bernie where you are &amp; be happy with a potential 2nd Trump term. I’ll work for all Dems to win. A big tent party; so long as you’re for people who need help, you belong here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarrisonLees @FatherLefty @TexasNewsHound @Pjevica @riotwomennn @JoyAnnReid — their presence will change the national discussion. I would push for him. But if you stay home if Bernie doesn’t win or ask others to stay home if they don’t like Bernie then Trump wins 🤞🏼. I don’t want President Pete or Biden or Yang or Bloomberg (Looooord) —<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarrisonLees @FatherLefty @TexasNewsHound @Pjevica @riotwomennn @JoyAnnReid If you don’t care about those who will be harmed if Trump wins in November, then you are not liberal, left, or progressive. If Bernie wins, awesome. I think he’d be great. I don’t know how he (or Warren) will pass everything in a divided congress but —<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarrisonLees @FatherLefty @TexasNewsHound @Pjevica @riotwomennn @JoyAnnReid If “the rest” stay home then Bernie doesn’t win. First, Warren isn’t a fake so that is BS. But if you think Klobuchar or Pete or Biden, and I massively dislike the latter two, is as bad as Trump then you’re out of your god damn mind and are in no way progressive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PoochieVince @gracattack Does the candidate with the second highest delegates go next? Surely it shouldn’t be the unvetted VP pick.  It’s horrible to discuss but I hope someone somewhere with means, in the dnc or in the campaigns has thought of this unlikely but plausible scenario.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PoochieVince @gracattack Horrid to say but he’s late 70s, as is Biden. Bernie had a recent albeit mild (are any?) heart attack. Should either win nomination, select VP and the horribly pass, what happens then? That’s my main worry. With 3 top candidates over 70 there needs to be a check for this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PoochieVince @gracattack I think Yang would be a good person to have in the Cabinet. Pete should run for senate in Iowa.  Warren, Bernie and also probably Klobuchar would be my tops. I have to say re: Bernie. That thought crosses my mind a lot. Like:<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TomBenthin @PoochieVince @gracattack @Adrienne7755186 @emccoy_writer @gini_luxe @SoCalforWarren @joshtpm @ewarren Agreed. But I think VP is a waste of her talent. I’m still hoping for Warren/Abrams ticket, with Abrams as POTUS next.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarrisonLees @FatherLefty @TexasNewsHound @Pjevica @riotwomennn @JoyAnnReid Not sure who “they” are but I mean EVERYONE. Blue wins with high turnout. We have the ppl but not EC votes that decide. I don’t care who wins. Warren‘s my choice but if Bernie or Pete win-cool. Any Dem is 👍🏼. Those who say no if their choice doesn’t win must check their privilege<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Warren has the clearest view on #SocialJustice compared to the rest of the world. Mostly because she seems to actually listen to the people it impacts the hardest.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I don’t want to make this political, it shouldn’t be.

<|startoftext|>@PodSaveThePpl @MsPackyetti @deray @ClintSmithIII @samswey Case was #SomersetvStewart from 1772. “[Slavery] is so odious, that nothing can be suffered to support it, but positive law.

<|startoftext|>@PodSaveThePpl @MsPackyetti @deray @ClintSmithIII @samswey Not as clean cut as this obviously, but came to me while listening today. Have to question the credentials of those historians troubled by #1619Project; it was abundantly clear that slavery, poorly framed as economical need, was at the forefront of the revolutionary war.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PodSaveThePpl @MsPackyetti @deray @ClintSmithIII @samswey RE: @ClintSmithIII’s news, there was a UK case in 1770s where an enslaved person taken from the colonies was basically set free by the Chief Justice after the holder tried to sell him to 🇯🇲 plantations; pro slavery colonials saw this as a front to their own “economic” choices.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benshapiro @PaulGavigan4 The number of flagrantly racist remarks on this thread especially by the ever disgusting @benshapiro is about as surprising as sunshine in California.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listening to @lawfareblog #Impeachment podcast with yesterday’s testimonies. LOVE how Pat Cipollone closes with “we’re in the age of constant investigations”, ignoring the YEARS &amp; $$$ spent investigating @HillaryClinton for… nada. But sure Pat. Dems need to calm down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You cannot be progressive, you are not liberal, you don’t care about equality if you refuse to note the constant sexism and racism levelled at women candidates for high office.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never tire of the benefits a @BernieSanders gets for comments &amp; vote for the ‘94 crime bill, as well as recent historical comments about Black people being more likely to sell drugs, while @ewarren is branded a snake, @KamalaHarrisa is a cop, and @HillaryClinton everything else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you see Black or Brown people as anything less than your equal then you aren’t even making the bar. It may not be intentional. It may not be violent. But it sure as shit is racist.  #VanessaNakate #BlackLivesMatter #ClimateJustice #EnvironmentalJustice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whether it’s the #OscarsSoWhite only nominating slave-based movies as worthy over the reality of a contemporary #Black experience, or literally deleting @vanessa_vash from media despite her pivotal role at a moment of #existentialcrisis, these are all acts of racism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Racism is not always lynchings. The fact so many white people only view #racism as a violent act shows our lack of #education; we see Black people as victims, as those to pity or to save. We don’t value your existence as #equals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yayarea100 @BookemDan_0 @sorrykb I get it. Bernie makes a mistake when he should have known better &amp; the first thing y’all do is condemn a Black woman for where she works. You claim the moral high ground one day &amp; then ignore poor judgement by pointing elsewhere. Funny how principles work for Bernie’s diehards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rgay So… the response from the Bernie stans can be summed up as: - But Hillary - But Iraq war - But 1% which are of course relevant.  Rogan’s past comments are dangerous. Remember when Trump inspired a nationalist to send bombs in the mail? Words matter. This was a mistake by Bernie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@2ownlife @DoomChild2 @barbraymond @HillaryClinton You really think GOP led committees didn’t look at every inconsequential detail to charge her? You think they’d clear her of all wrongdoing several times? No one says she’s perfect. But she isn’t responsible. You can think so but actual facts aren’t with you. You need to move on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrRyanTalks @qowicome 👀👀👀👀🔥<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scc94s @adamcbest @JoyAnnReid Say what you like about Warren, &amp; SOME of it is fair, she’s at least showing she’s willing to work with others to get things done. It won’t be perfect, but democracy isn’t perfect. As much as I want either of them to snap their fingers to end corruption etc… that won’t happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scc94s @adamcbest @JoyAnnReid In governing you either have to give a little to get a little or take a sweeping mandate. The latter seems unlikely, &amp; with the lack of equal representation in the Senate… Bernie’s principles, I’m for them. I just don’t know how he’s going to translate that into legislation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scc94s @adamcbest @JoyAnnReid You know governing IS compromise? Say Bernie/Warren win in Nov. How does M4A get passed? The people (atm) aren’t totally for it, &amp; Congress isn’t. POTUS isn’t a monarch; a deal will need to be made. Principles tell me who they are, not how they’ll get shit done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scc94s @adamcbest @JoyAnnReid She endorsed HRC at the end, after the delegates had been counted, after Obama. It was for unity. The same way neutrals endorsed Obama in ‘08. Reverse the numbers, Obama, Biden &amp; Warren would’ve endorsed Bernie &amp; y’all would be silencing Clinton voters who say they betrayed her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Landorcan @adamcbest @JoyAnnReid I also don’t care anymore. I’d vote for her. I’d vote for him. That’s my preference. Ideally not Biden or Pete. You’re solely dedicated to Bernie and that’s great. If he doesn’t win the nomination I’d like to think you’d support anyone who isn’t Trump. I will. But this is tiring.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Landorcan @adamcbest @JoyAnnReid Literally didn’t hear any part of that. But his campaign has also trashed her recently. Friendship or allyship goes both ways here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Landorcan If you’re suggesting Tulsi, an LGBTQ+ basher, is better than Warren then you lose any validity on the morality argument here. And this is very much going down the road of “she must get in line”, which by the way is sexist verging on misogyny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Landorcan @adamcbest @JoyAnnReid But IF he’s in the wrong (IF), it‘d be sexist; misogyny is a vile hatred of women. Many men are sexist in comments &amp; actions. Those like Trump &amp; Miller are misogynists. The idea of losing to or answering to a woman makes them sick. Sexist isn’t OK but it allows for growth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Landorcan @adamcbest @JoyAnnReid Or, he probably meant to say something along the lines of “it’ll be hard against trump - look at the misogyny against Hillary in media” etc, but he phased it poorly &amp; it came across as a woman can’t win. That’s a guess. I don’t know. But I’d support either of them regardless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Landorcan @adamcbest @JoyAnnReid That is illogical. I don’t think she’d have worked with him if he was actually misogynist. But by your phrasing here, Bernie marching in the 60s means he’s better aligned to racial equality than Black people? She’s a woman. He isn’t better at women’s rights than she is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Landorcan @adamcbest @JoyAnnReid She didn’t call him a misogynist. But I’d like to point out YOU WERENT IN THE ROOM. You don’t know what was said. Neither do I. But in all likelihood he said something off the cuff as men everywhere that we expect to be taken one way but is interpreted another way by a woman.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Landorcan @adamcbest @JoyAnnReid If you listened to what she said about her brothers then you’d rethink that. I’d also like to point out Bernie has voted with Trump more than Warren &amp; Gillibrand… so that argument doesn’t hold well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigbuckswaltz @angleet @adamcbest @JoyAnnReid Except that none of this matters because I care about what she does now. If she apologised for past errors and works through in the right way then good. If I never spoke to anyone who was anti-queer at some point in their life then my circle wouldn’t include my parents.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bella7574414922 @adamcbest @JoyAnnReid Love when a bot who supports Trump pretends someone else is lying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Landorcan @adamcbest @JoyAnnReid But yes Bernie got involved and that’s great. I’d also like to point out Bernie has endorsed her. So… it’s really weird how y’all want to bad mouth someone Bernie actually agrees with. But you do you, sweet potato.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Landorcan @adamcbest @JoyAnnReid Her actual speech at FS isn’t quite the scandal you think. Also the only info other than her saying she voted for Ford in the primary, is based on “friends”; some say she never discussed politics &amp; others say she was die-hard conservative.

<|startoftext|>@BrianMcCart6 @BoringWebDev @jmalbart @lilmort3steve @HillaryClinton You may say they shouldn’t have done the crime. Fair. But most sentences don’t reflect the crime. There‘s no forgiveness, which is key to the process. Everyone who’s done time is sentenced to life regardless cos the system won’t forgive. It’s a poll tax made to steal citizenship.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrianMcCart6 @BoringWebDev @jmalbart @lilmort3steve @HillaryClinton Except in most cases these fees aren’t listed in sentencing docs &amp; thus can be manipulated by local authorities. And that’s overlooking the harsh reality that the majority of those impacted will never be able to pay. So a 2yr sentence can become a decade-plus? How is that just?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adamcbest @JoyAnnReid She’s honestly the best messenger for big policy discussion - whether economical, political, social, academic, intellectual, or whatever - that I‘be ever experienced.

<|startoftext|>@BrianMcCart6 @jmalbart @lilmort3steve @HillaryClinton At writing, the constitution didn’t outlaw slavery, nor make space for women. It seems almost intentional. So please hold your concern over who gets to vote. Citizens. Full stop. You’re still a citizen once you’re out of prison. The constitution is wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jrizzii44 @HillaryClinton Lol funny given how a decade of investigations performed by the most partisan of investigators have found.....… fuck all. But your cute for trying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrianMcCart6 @jmalbart @lilmort3steve @HillaryClinton Incorrect. It’s a fundamental part of any democracy otherwise it’s autocracy. Thus it’s a right. No one should have that right taken away from them, whether we agree or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s hugely unlikely but I love a good hypothetical…  …what happens if the Senate #ImpeachTrump &amp; #ImpeachPence during an election year?

<|startoftext|>@WheelerBiko @GKitten666 @ThePforPieter @MsPackyetti @serenawilliams This isn’t to ignore the horror of poverty for everyone. But there is more at play here than just a bank balance.  “Black Americans and American Indians in well-off families are much likelier to fall behind than white kids.”   https://t.co/fsxrOazFCg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WheelerBiko @GKitten666 @ThePforPieter @MsPackyetti @serenawilliams You need to look at the whole story. Getting access to things that cost money doesn’t suddenly enfranchize you to the Rich White American Man club. It just means you have more access. But the systemic problems you face are still there. No amount of money will ever remove them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WheelerBiko @GKitten666 @ThePforPieter @MsPackyetti Yes in theory. But rich Black people aren’t treated the same as rich white people. Even those without a lot of money. They may have more access to healthcare etc. but a rich Black woman will still be shunned when she’s in a hospital despite her money.  See: @serenawilliams.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GKitten666 @WheelerBiko @ThePforPieter @MsPackyetti “The only privilege that matters” is an absolutely absurd thing to say, especially about a Black woman in America.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid Thankful I moved to Canada… the UK is not a country I want to go back to. England specifically is probably the most xenophobic and racist country I’ve ever experienced. The US might be more blatant, but the original colonizers miss the English empire days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nhannahjones @miles_k I actually have, but I have an English accent and was in America at the time. Spoke to a largely white American audience, a group who seem to have a peculiar obsession with the voice of colonial empire.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@j_Benjo @MsPackyetti “I don’t do identity politics” is in fact identity politics. White male politicians “built” (read: stole, manipulated) the system you call neutral.

<|startoftext|>@shar_abbott @HillaryClinton @Schwarzenegger Arguing it stops centralizing voter power in NY/LA when that is where the most people are is a statement against democracy. It's not about the cities. It's about the people who make up those cities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shar_abbott @HillaryClinton @Schwarzenegger The EC was agreed on for two reasons: to ensure a corrupt populist wasn't elected (clearly it doesn't work), and to ensure the slave states kept power at least in line with the "free" states.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shar_abbott @HillaryClinton @Schwarzenegger #OnePersonOneVote is equal. It doesn't matter where the people are. They can be spread evenly around the country or all in one place. But the majority of the people should get to choose their reps. Not geography. Not ideological break down. There is no "equal" argument for EC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shar_abbott @HillaryClinton @Schwarzenegger This is bull. The pop. of the 10 biggest cities total nearly 30m, larger than WI, CO, MN, GA, NV &amp; NH combined. What this literally says: certain kinds of voters (cities tend to home left/leaning ideologies) shouldn't have theirs count as equal to rural votes (centre/right).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dz1241 @KenHicken @_Vs_The_World @Molly_NYC @arlenparsa Also the rainbow flag guy has a name. Literally fucking there before the flag.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dz1241 @KenHicken @_Vs_The_World @Molly_NYC @arlenparsa …as some peace accord. The US  terrorized it’s own people while perpetuating liberty. Until everyone is actually free we should not celebrate this as the land of the free. Other majority white nations like Scandinavia are &amp; have been more inclusive than America has ever been.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dz1241 @KenHicken @_Vs_The_World @Molly_NYC @arlenparsa 3/ Why all the questions? Why do we need to figure out a way for you to be convinced that the revolution did not and has not lived up to its lofty promises? I’m not google. If you care then research yourself. I literally said what happened can be appreciated, but not celebrated…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dz1241 @KenHicken @_Vs_The_World @Molly_NYC @arlenparsa 2/ As I pointed out, no country was great, but the question was about the 18th century where Scandinavia as well as Eastern European countries didn’t accept or condone slavery. I didn’t say the US was the worst, but not exempt from this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dz1241 @KenHicken @_Vs_The_World @Molly_NYC @arlenparsa 1/ Europe has been fought over for millennia. But it has mostly been done white folks against white folks. That is an entirely different situation than going across the world to steal Black people and take them to another corner to steal land (and massacre) Native people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dz1241 @KenHicken @_Vs_The_World @Molly_NYC @arlenparsa Also, large swathes of Europe didn’t establish or condone slavery, with a similar or better democratic republican system. No (white) state was or has ever been perfect. But the US, born on the backs of slaves forced to work on stolen Native land, is certainly not excused.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dz1241 @KenHicken @_Vs_The_World @Molly_NYC @arlenparsa The conditioning language is literally to celebrate, deify the FF and to act any other way is deemed as unpatriotic etc. If you’re unable to see how they simply accepted slavery, misogyny while spouting “all men are created equal” then you are frankly delusional.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KenHicken @dz1241 @_Vs_The_World @Molly_NYC @arlenparsa @dz1241 I’m sorry, they created a government system which accepted the enslavement and systemic oppression of people who were poor, Black, Brown, Indigenous, and of course, women.

<|startoftext|>@rhondaprell @joshuamcsee @GeneralMills88 @clgomn @realPolitiDiva @HumesGreg @mvmarini @AOC This is BS. So you think geography, the actual land matters more than people?

<|startoftext|>@GeminiWahhaj @JoyAnnReid I mean I can understand the first part of your comment, perhaps. But the latter is straight misinformation. Bernie isn’t leading with women or POC. Sadly it’s Biden with the majority share of POC &amp; women support thus far.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GeordieJay "I'm sick of the fucking gays attacking each other for no reason, but here we are... Pick your battles and be thankful our voices are being heard at all."  Personally I feel attacked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dean0909 You're right. The outrage should be on your profile picture.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sexualhealthLDN @IdiosyncraticXL Believing any anger on mental health, rise in syphilis, the extreme race disparity perpetuated by our own community is unwarranted then I'm frankly concerned about your views on our community. If we can't self correct as a community then there's zero point in the community.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ating85 @Mike_BSP @IdiosyncraticXL But there is no outrage. At all.  People aren't outraged about the racial implications on donations and never use those statistics when making their arguments. People aren't up in arms about the tragic state of our community's mental health. But they are about blood donation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acsofian @chrissyteigen @bex0760 @BernieSanders This was fun. But I'm out now. Genuinely no point in ever trying to have a conversation with the Bernie people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acsofian @chrissyteigen @bex0760 @BernieSanders Dem's cannot win without Black women. He failed to succeed there in 2016 and isn't polling well enough with Black women now. The guy you say has been fighting racism for decades may need to amend how he speaks on the issues and take time to listen a little more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acsofian @chrissyteigen @bex0760 @BernieSanders I also suggest you speak to the large number of Black people with serious concerns with Bernie ignoring specific issues facing their communities in his econ policies. I’m neither Black nor Brown but spend time listening to those who are - &amp; they have serious qualms with him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acsofian @chrissyteigen @bex0760 @BernieSanders 2006. Senate debate. This is after MA passed marriage equality. He says it’s a state issue - something the right always said to ban it - &amp; should remain so. At best, his answer is weak.  https://t.co/bzBzeZIiUZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acsofian @chrissyteigen @bex0760 @jamieeierm @BernieSanders Being “pro gay/anti homophobia” doesn’t equate to queer people deserve equal rights. Clinton was shit with marriage but wasn’t against queer people. Bernie, champion of progressivism, didn’t come out nationally for gay marriage until it was politically convenient.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acsofian @chrissyteigen @bex0760 @jamieeierm @BernieSanders Wow. Given I regularly work to ensure white gays stop fetishizing, erasing QPOC &amp; push for their experience to be front and center of all queer issues, yours is a really fun reading of my words there. You may want to fine tune those investigatory skills though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acsofian @chrissyteigen @bex0760 @jamieeierm @BernieSanders When BS could have had an impact &amp; didn’t, thousands of gays and trans people were killed and beaten. Yet he still claimed the progressive mantle. That is personal to me. Is it the same level? No &amp; I never meant to suggest it was &amp; apologize if that’s how you took it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acsofian @sexyassdrone @CreativeMrPen @narrow_urethra @chrissyteigen @bex0760 @jamieeierm @BernieSanders The point being no candidate is perfect. I don’t agree with Warren’s pro Israel stance and hope she changes. But too often the argument devolves to ‘Bernie is perfect’ when he‘s shown he isn’t. Are these equivalent? Absolutely not. That doesn’t mean he shouldn’t be scutinized.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProfessorPickl5 @acsofian @CreativeMrPen @narrow_urethra @chrissyteigen @bex0760 @jamieeierm @BernieSanders Which is cute given you don’t know any of my views.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acsofian @sexyassdrone @CreativeMrPen @narrow_urethra @chrissyteigen @bex0760 @jamieeierm @BernieSanders Which candidate did I defend? The only other candidate I mentioned this morning was Warren who’s done a better job of selling her message on healthcare.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neverbeenowned @acsofian @ProfessorPickl5 @CreativeMrPen @narrow_urethra @chrissyteigen @bex0760 @jamieeierm @BernieSanders All democrats including Hillary were bad with it. The fact Biden was the first in Obama Admin to say something is bogus. All candidates are imperfect and to suggest Bernie has always been right about everything is disingenuous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acsofian @sexyassdrone @CreativeMrPen @narrow_urethra @chrissyteigen @bex0760 @jamieeierm @BernieSanders Because white guys have destroyed the planet and more often than not we need to shut up step aside and listen to people who don’t look like us or have our experiences. And I’m tired of seeing too many white men attack, not debate, women of color specifically.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neverbeenowned @ProfessorPickl5 @acsofian @CreativeMrPen @narrow_urethra @chrissyteigen @bex0760 @jamieeierm @BernieSanders There’s a difference between outright M4All and having it as an option. M4All is vastly popular. But less so when it’s presented as the be all and end all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acsofian @neverbeenowned @ProfessorPickl5 @CreativeMrPen @narrow_urethra @chrissyteigen @bex0760 @jamieeierm @BernieSanders And there are tonnes of videos &amp; news articles, as well as the candidates themselves talking to people who don’t support *outright* medical overhaul. Many want options to buy into.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acsofian @neverbeenowned @ProfessorPickl5 @CreativeMrPen @narrow_urethra @chrissyteigen @bex0760 @jamieeierm @BernieSanders Bernie in the past said states should decide on gay marriage. That was code for not wanting to do anything. Advocates wanted federal recognition. That affected my community, and he didn’t want to take the stand when it mattered. All candidates have had problems. None are perfect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neverbeenowned @ProfessorPickl5 @acsofian @CreativeMrPen @narrow_urethra @chrissyteigen @bex0760 @jamieeierm @BernieSanders I’m not entirely sure how that correlates to what I said. If he isn’t winning over a number of people who don’t support outright medical overhaul - which I wish they did - then he has to explain his position and policy better and sell it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProfessorPickl5 @acsofian @CreativeMrPen @narrow_urethra @chrissyteigen @bex0760 @jamieeierm @BernieSanders There seems to be a view that if you don’t agree with Bernie as a candidate then you’re a centrist. I’m not. Neither are a lot of people who don’t support him. He changed the party platform for the better. But that doesn’t mean we have to think he’s the best candidate/messenger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sexyassdrone @acsofian @CreativeMrPen @narrow_urethra @chrissyteigen @bex0760 @jamieeierm @BernieSanders Thanks 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProfessorPickl5 @acsofian @CreativeMrPen @narrow_urethra @chrissyteigen @bex0760 @jamieeierm @BernieSanders It actually is a thing. Get off Twitter and speak to people. It’s mostly because it’s what they’re used to and once they can see it work they may change their minds, but for now many want the option. Bernie isn’t selling it to these folks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProfessorPickl5 @acsofian @CreativeMrPen @narrow_urethra @chrissyteigen @bex0760 @jamieeierm @BernieSanders Which is exactly my point…?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neverbeenowned @ProfessorPickl5 @acsofian @CreativeMrPen @narrow_urethra @chrissyteigen @bex0760 @jamieeierm @BernieSanders I completely agree. But if people haven’t switched to his view then he has to do more to address that. You have to change people’s mind to lead. He changed the platform - awesome. But he’s missing the most important step and other candidates are doing it better like Warren.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProfessorPickl5 @acsofian @CreativeMrPen @narrow_urethra @chrissyteigen @bex0760 @jamieeierm @BernieSanders The thing about Bernie is he has great ideas but he doesn’t sell them well enough across the board, nor does he address the systemic problems or have comprehensive plans. Especially on race, gender and queer identity. He misses a lot but demands agreement despite it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProfessorPickl5 @acsofian @CreativeMrPen @narrow_urethra @chrissyteigen @bex0760 @jamieeierm @BernieSanders M4All is also great but he refused to actually hear the people - not the corporate views - on healthcare. Many, way too many, like their paid insurance and don’t want to change. Telling them there would be an overhaul is scary if you have chronic illnesses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProfessorPickl5 @acsofian @CreativeMrPen @narrow_urethra @chrissyteigen @bex0760 @jamieeierm @BernieSanders The problem with Bernie is the money of it all. Tuition free college is awesome but he didn’t spend time talking about restructuring a system that is broken regardless of the fees. A UG degree does not guarantee work, nor does a PG. Making it free is only part of the problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ProfessorPickl5 @acsofian @CreativeMrPen @narrow_urethra @chrissyteigen @bex0760 @jamieeierm @BernieSanders Actually no the argument was that she’s rich and therefore doesn’t get a say. Regardless of her views she’s allowed a voice and telling her as so many Bernie fans and super right wingers continue to do (funny how there’s so much crossover) to stay in “her lane” is BS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CreativeMrPen @narrow_urethra @chrissyteigen @bex0760 @jamieeierm @BernieSanders That you claim to be a progressive yet ignore and overlook voices of people who don’t look like you or share your exact views speaks volumes to your actual motives and shows your complete inability to comprehend actual progressive values.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acsofian @CreativeMrPen @narrow_urethra @chrissyteigen @bex0760 @jamieeierm @BernieSanders I don’t think there’s anything low key about it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acsofian @CreativeMrPen @narrow_urethra @chrissyteigen @bex0760 @jamieeierm @BernieSanders Bernie’s also rich by the way. Should he step aside? Because that’s literally the argument you’re making.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acsofian @CreativeMrPen @narrow_urethra @chrissyteigen @bex0760 @jamieeierm @BernieSanders Um… he’s not the only progressive candidate there so to say that really shows how little you understand about progressivism. Also Chrissy is allowed a voice. I’m pretty sure it’s meant to be one person one vote. She’s entitled to her opinion and you reduced her to her wealth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CreativeMrPen @narrow_urethra @chrissyteigen @bex0760 @jamieeierm @BernieSanders It’s like you’re a parody account unable to help himself. I also love the whole white male attacking the woman of color because she won’t bow to his view. It’s like history on never ending repeat. People like you ruined Bernie. Plus: he may have great ideas, but his policy sucks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scurry_1 @IdiosyncraticXL …did you read Phil’s first tweet? They’re literally in there. Many such as yourself have addressed the language and focused entirely on “but we should be allowed to donate” but have completely walked past the actual point of the tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scurry_1 @IdiosyncraticXL I’d agree but Phil didn’t say that. I’d argue that’s your reading. Obviously it’s social media and tone can always be difficult but I think his point was clear: The issues are being ignored for the political argument. Winning the fight is more important than solving the problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Real_Toons @Kalvin_254 @Google We got falafel though! So glad that got it’s celebration…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scurry_1 @IdiosyncraticXL Yes. But white experience is very different than the Black experience. Moreso when you add in Queer. Focusing on singular experiences is detrimental; when we jump up &amp; down on someone else for trying to widen our views on issues we show our true selves. One for all &amp; one for all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scurry_1 @IdiosyncraticXL You mentioned about people focusing on what matters to them. Fair. But when QPOC bring up say the Black Pride flag, white gays lose our shit. Focusing only on ourselves is a disservice to our community. White gays like talking about “our” community, yet we refuse to show up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scurry_1 @IdiosyncraticXL You’re right - I have no data to back up my claim. But neither do you. But as a white cis gay man who’s been around a large number of white cis gay men, the focus on blood donation is frankly due to its appeal, the sexiness of the issue. It’s politics over policy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scurry_1 @IdiosyncraticXL I completely disagree that it’s a minority. I’d be willing to stake that if it is a minority it’s a significant one. Focusing the argument on the language rather than the issue at hand is frankly a waste of a tweet and does nothing for the community.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BMerc_ @IdiosyncraticXL Also don’t refer to people as “untapped resources”. Ever.  That’s colonial language. Stop that.  “Discriminatory policy prevents people helping citizenry at large be healthier”.  That was without even trying. ‘Untapped resource’… I’m not a fucking book hidden in a library.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BMerc_ @IdiosyncraticXL When there’s NO CAMPAIGN on the surge in syphilis diagnoses, or the negative label we (white gays) dump on LGBTQ+ people living with HIV, or the specific issues facing Black trans women who are the most likely to be murdered in society, where’s the justified “enraged state” then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShowerAbsolute @IdiosyncraticXL While we’re at it - gays not being able to give blood NOT AS BAD as what Phil laid out above.  But let’s use the geopolitics of Sudan as a fucking answer to ignore the point Phil made.  This is the whitest shit I’ve ever seen. And I grew up in fucking Tory central.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ShowerAbsolute @IdiosyncraticXL You’re right, by the way. I don’t know if you’re white. But by putting this BS as a comeback you push the white/patriarchal/heteronormative argument used for centuries to put down the marginalized - whether women, Queer, Black or Brown people, able-bodied etc.   Either way, stop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IdiosyncraticXL I’d really like to poll cis [white] gays who go more than three months without sex and how quick they rush to donate blood as it’s clearly so important. And then cross check that with the twitter-angry [white] gays outraged at the audacity of not being able to do something. 🕵🏻‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tcanham459 @IdiosyncraticXL @ismailosaurus It’s curiously funny how often we regularly choose to bring QPOC (or POC broadly) into our arguments yet don’t actually address the specific problems facing QPOC (or, again, POC broadly).  I’m really stressing *we* in this statement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ismailosaurus @IdiosyncraticXL BREAKING NEWS: that isn’t the reality of what actually happens when the white cis gays get outraged 😱<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EthanLDN @IdiosyncraticXL @FreedomToDonate Have a great night, Ethan! X<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EthanLDN @IdiosyncraticXL @FreedomToDonate Giving blood is not a solution to the ACTUAL problems. Problems you have failed to acknowledge here.  But many [white cis] gay men regularly get stuck on what *we’re* not allowed to do, while ignoring the key problems.   That’s what you’ve done, by the way, as clearly seen here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EthanLDN @IdiosyncraticXL @FreedomToDonate If I was told tomorrow that was reversed it would be awesome. I’d donate as soon as I could. But my being allowed to does not alter the current issues surrounding: the negative stigma of people living with HIV, mental health of the QUILTBAG community, the sharp rise in syphilis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EthanLDN @IdiosyncraticXL @FreedomToDonate Let’s go another way - personal anecdote time, gather round: I’m a gay Type 1 Diabetic. I’m categorically denied the right to donate blood despite mine probably being better as it’s checked more than the “average” Brit. Go figure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EthanLDN @IdiosyncraticXL @FreedomToDonate It’s literally the biggest cop out I’ve read in a long time. And I read a lot from Republican politicians 🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EthanLDN @IdiosyncraticXL @FreedomToDonate But white cis gay men have a habit of overlooking other topics in the gay community, focusing instead on ourselves and what *we* can’t have. You’ve shown that here; you refuse to confront Phil’s laid out points, instead denigrating him, saying he sees healthcare as “binary”.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EthanLDN @IdiosyncraticXL @FreedomToDonate You have completely overlooked that this is the issue; you’ve made the political argument more important than the reality of the problem. No one said donating blood isn’t important and to suggest otherwise shows a gross misunderstanding of this debate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EthanLDN @IdiosyncraticXL @FreedomToDonate Hi Ethan. I find it interesting how you keep jumping in with your accusatory “binary” statement, yet never actually spend time responding to any of Phil’s varying points. Instead you just repeat your frankly pointless stand over &amp; over… yet you’ve offered nothing here.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mtracey I’m happy with terrifying white kids from using the N word, and cis/heteros from using the F slur and other harmful, violent terms used to attack marginalized groups.

<|startoftext|>@crissles Genuinely struggle with this question a lot.

<|startoftext|>@DrRyanTalks The sex could be better 🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrRyanTalks The school pic? (I just researched) - I’ve not paid attention. But if that’s what we’re annoyed about we need to get off Twitter &amp; read something. The man is a colossal idiot, but objectively very handsome. There‘s always been lots of hot conservative politicians. Annoyingly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrRyanTalks Generally to the Twitterverse?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joebelhar @DrRyanTalks People have to start giving and frankly, while one side is standing by their morality for all people, the other is clinging to their pride. Neither will be willing to concede ground. So the poles will drift further. At best we’re looking at decades before a resolution.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joebelhar @DrRyanTalks Obviously the content of that tweet only builds on this problem. But there’s more than just two ideologies at play here. There’s a difference in reasoning and morals. It’s more difficult now to get people to understand a different POV because of “fake news” and the like.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joebelhar @DrRyanTalks I don’t think this ever will be resolved. We’re in the age where people refuse to listen &amp; think. One side in particular stands by (&amp; ignites) their racist/sexist/queerphobic notions, and too often take pride in ignoring experts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shaunking @BernieSanders But Bernie voted for the bill…?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is my absolute favorite tweet about #GameOfThrones so far<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid This is my absolute favorite tweet about #GameOfThrones so far<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Veerrrz @meemsings @cmclymer I’m not disagreeing with these elements. But her mindset between season 7 &amp; 8, even 8.3 to 8.4 is huge. Those are hints but could’ve gone either way. They weren’t definitive indicators. This escalation was sudden. They either built it too slow to start or too quick at the end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joe_363_ I get that, but it’s also in the show with all the talk of the coin flip, and how everyone seems to be going on about her as the mad queen. I’m just pissed they’ve decided to just forget about narrative and go nuts for the sake. I’d be cool seeing her this way if it was built up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only truly “mad” person we’ve seen on #GamefThrones is #Joffrey. He was a sociopath.  And I guess #TheMountain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love Arya but she enjoys killing. She slaughtered all the Freys because of the #RedWedding. That wasn’t just. Most of those men were just following orders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dany isn’t perfect and if she was destined to fall into the “mad” trap then fine. But D&amp;D have destroyed her arc by just throwing her into the darkness for the sake of spectacle and using past events to justify it when no one else is pushed that way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Robb Stark sacrifices parts of his own men to win a battle. Dany burned the Khals yes to have the Dothraki follow her, but also because these men were rapists who abused women because they could.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dany crucified the Masters in Bay of Dragons because, y’know… slave holders. I find it weird we all find that one example of madness. Yet “honor” taught Ned Stark to execute people who ran from the Night’s Watch. As did Jon Snow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>— no one questioned Robert Baratheon starting a war over Lyanna Stark falling in love and marrying someone else. Yes Aerys was a bad king but that wasn’t why the other houses rose up against the Targaryens in the 17 years before season 1.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Daenerys reacting in grief because her dragon-child was murdered before her best friend, after losing most of her people in a battle no one really thanked her for and in fact the northerners continued to dislike her despite it… mad. OK fair. But —<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When #Cersei used wildfire to destroy the Sept of Baelor in season 6, it was masterful. Even applauded because the High Sparrow was also destroyed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need to ask why #Daenerys is supposedly mad? Others in #GamefThrones have acted out in similarly horrific ways. It was “mad” when she torched the Lannister army in season 7. Yet #Tyrion burning Stannis’ army with wildfire in season 2 wasn’t mad. It was clever, brave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Veerrrz @meemsings @cmclymer Which is fine if it’s done well. But literally dropping slight hints (the hints being similar to those performed by other “non mad” leaders) through earlier seasons to then dropping a colossal bomb? They ruined her and her arc, whether she was always meant to be mad or not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThatsMrTomNolan Absolute 100% agreement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t think I enjoyed that as much as others. I have serious fucking questions with the damn show runners about what they’ve done. This isn’t the same show anymore. #GamefThrones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What. In. The. Actual. Fuck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OK. That was cool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why didn’t Yara get involved since the Night King is dead? #GameOfThrones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well. We’ve been here before, Ser Jaime #GameOfThrones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’s kinda hard to believe this is the same show #NedStark started. #GameOfThrones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can we just burn everyone down? Let someone rule the ashes. Shame Littlefinger isn’t here anymore to do it. #GameOfThrones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well. That was cold how she said that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I used to love Varys… pretty sure he’ll be dead soon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don’t take it, you boring fuck #JonSnow #GameOfThrones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>God I hope they don’t fuck this up #GameOfThrones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well. I’m about ready to disappointed… #GameOfThrones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#WhiteGayMen &amp; women like holding our #queer status, ignoring our #whiteprivilege. Forgetting is privilege in itself. #WhiteWomen &amp; gays need to work harder to address this; bring more people in, widen our community, and more often than not, step aside for #BIPOC.  https://t.co/P6RwnlaQOI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MsPackyetti @fivefifths To be honest as bad as that sounds I’m not against it. Better than their current idea of throwing ALL the support behind the most bland, uninteresting character; the white man over a suddenly “mad with power” woman, or frankly anyone else. This season is shockingly bad thus far.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I officially hate this season #GameOfThrones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid Captain Spanish Eggs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#ElizabethWarren is leading the way in my view. Gotta respect someone who actually has a mind and knows what she’s talking about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joe_363_ My brother in law. At least I believe he’s straight. That’d make an awkward conversation…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am #TeamStacey until I die.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll be honest. This battle was lauded as the greatest on screen, TV &amp; film. And to be honest, I preferred #Endgame.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just had to rewatch #Arya kill the #NightKing three times. It. Is. GLORIOUS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And #SamwellTarly still has time to cry… 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Sansa - love her normally… but hiding away like this? When she has an actual weapon?? Even #Daenerys  is on the field fighting. Disappointed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She can survive fire. So why not just have Drogon burn the fields to a crisp?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AND this is why I will be cremated. #TheLongNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I mean… did no one prepare for the awakening? Stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did Rhaegal die?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NOT TODAY!!!!!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"What do we say to the #GodofDeath?" Is perhaps the best of all #GOT lines.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm assuming #Ghost died?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Honest to God… #Arya was the best thing about this episode. I'm honestly disappointed. Her badassery juxtaposed with her absolute terror is everything. Everything else is tired and drawn out. #TheLongNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Arya should be an #AvengersEndgame  @MarvelStudios - you should add her to #Phase4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was 2am when I watched this. Was half asleep. Can't remember if nobody dies or lots of important secondary characters die. Guess I'll find out 🤷‍♂️  #GameofThrones #TheLongNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When the #Wights throw themselves on the fire, did anyone else think of #Okoye disgusted by their self sacrifice? It's like these Westeroses haven't even seen #Avengers #InfinityWar. It's  been out for a year, guys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I ADORE #MISSANDEI SHE SHOULD BE QUEEN Forever loyal, forever honest, forever doesn't put up with the bullshit despite the horrors the northerners give her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why wait to light the trenches? Why not have two lines? One further out, and one closer to #Winterfell? I don't know much about battle strategy, but I feel fairly confident that more defense against an overwhelming army might just help… But maybe I'm wrong? 💁🏻‍♀️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Melisandre is a wicked woman. Both meanings for wicked count. #LordofLight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>AND NOW let's sacrifice the #Unsullied 🙄 It's almost like #GOT/#Westeros doesn't like foreigners/Brown people. But I guess it's OK if the WHITES survived 😒  #GameofThrones<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#BrienneOfTarth is my spirit animal. Her and #AryaStark - I'll take them over any man! ♥️💜<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Used to like #SamwellTarly but why the fuck is he on the field? IF YOU CANNOT FIGHT THEN DON'T GET IN THE WAY! Another Brother of the Nights Watch falls after trying to get Sam up and safe. Poor #EddisonTollett. Doesn't even get a face after this. #GOT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does #JonSnow get a dragon after dropping the "I'm your nephew" bombshell on #DaenerysTargaryen last week? He doesn't deserve her dragons anymore. #Rhaegal #Drogon #IDontLikeJonSnow #GameofThrones #TheLongNight #BattleOfWinterfell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rewatching #GameofThrones #TheLongNight  1/ Why did the #Dothraki need to be sacrificed so soon? Why not stay with #Winterfell? Like… what the actual fuck? Half the defense gone immediately. Smart. 🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MsPackyetti I legit just started crying again 😢<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dzennon No lies. Genuine blush. Hope you’re well, handsome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xPlumpGB @Ancestry @miles_k “Just as much”? I hope you’re just really bad at humor. Really bad. Good fucking grief.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@miles_k Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy What is actually the point right now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dzennon I’d be responding with a diamond after that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@browardsheriff congratulations on beating up a 15 year old kid, you toxic sadistic criminals. #JusticeForLucca #BlackLivesMatter #BlueLivesMurder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ihatecarcommer1 @ciansong One case: the devastation UK/Europe &amp; US inflicted on the Middle East long before 9/11 &amp; no one cared. But they attack our societies &amp; suddenly the world must defeat the terrorist menace. And now terror is a synonym for Islam. The world is made to care about white problems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ihatecarcommer1 @ciansong BIPOC are told to care when white Americans &amp; Europeans are attacked; an attack on one is an attack on all. But when it’s an attack or disaster affecting predominantly non white people, our white culture shuts up. Please go learn about white privilege. Then get back to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ciansong White people are the ones to separate the races, either through outright segregation where we’re always so conveniently on top, or through systemic oppression. Apparently you don’t see that. And I can’t help you with your blind ignorance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ciansong I’d like to see all the white Catholics go to Africa to actually help people rather than teach contraception as an abomination helping to spread HIV more easily. But yes. The important thing is a billion dollars going to ND instead of helping the poor. Jesus would love that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ciansong You need to learn about white privilege, colonization, history told from a singular perspective, about media, culture, society all being built on whiteness. No. Not only whites care. But why is it only BIPOC who care about non white/European problems? Ask yourself that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ciansong About the reality of white European churches getting a billion dollars in two days to rebuild when anything not white is still waiting to even be discussed? No - I learned that. Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MsPackyetti Harvla, of the House of Pillows<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why isn't the media calling #AttorneyGeneral #WilliamBarr corrupt? His actions are not the standard of another Attorney General. He is playing with the rules to get an outcome he wants. What happened to independent @TheJusticeDept? Start calling #corruption corruption.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Case in point:   https://t.co/9dMtYJ3fWy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I empathize with those who are sad. But I disagree with the mourning &amp; monetary support for a building over everything else in this world.  This is #whiteprivilege once more showing up in the only way it knows: #Materialism being more valuable than #BlackLives &amp; #BrownLives. /End<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That money could help the poor, the marginalized. Or #France could pay #reparations to #Haiti for not just slavery but for demanding their own reparations for “loss of property”🤦🏻‍♂️ Haiti, ruined by French greed &amp; racism, is owed around $20bil. But sure. Let’s rebuild a church. /7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As one who cries more at Disney movies than deaths around the world, I’m not saying you cannot be saddened by #NotreDame. But we must look at our collective reaction, &amp; the swift collection of rebuilding donations (€300m+ in &lt;24 hours). It is a paradigm of #WhitePrivilege. /6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Then there’s the framing of victims; tragic reactions when white people are abused, assaulted or killed vs. those of #BIPOC. The narrative changes drastically when suddenly a story isn’t worth our collective empathy. /5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look at how #Ebola was covered in the media. The narrative was on the impact on it spreading to Europe &amp; North America. Conversations on how it affected people in the African nations were lost, while discussions on a cyclone killing #BlackPeople simply didn’t occur. /4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And when #indigenous lands &amp; monuments are stolen, torn down, burned, sometimes to make way for a highway of all things, no one raises hell or gets on their knees. The west only cares about news associated with #whiteness because us #whitepeople are inherently racist. /3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is a lot of shit in the world. Too much, and people shouldn’t have to (or can) can about everything. Did you know a cyclone hit Western Africa recently, injuring, displacing &amp; killing thousands? If you didn’t you’re forgiven as it barely registered a blip online. /2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Regarding #NotreDameCathedral people who are sad should feel free to be so. It is sad. However there is a real problem with the general reaction. When I see people *literally* on their knees praying in the streets, in tears, when no one died, with literal “RIP” posts on SM. /1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Strangeland_Elf This is awesome! Did you ever do one for Endgame with Captain Marvel, Wasp, Ant-Man, Hawkeye?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid @MsPackyetti Jon Snow doesn’t have that many facial expressions. He’s a snooze. Honorable, kind, &amp; handsome, but good grief does he suck all the energy out of the scene.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I’m just gonna say this:  #JonSnow is exhaustingly dull. Yes he’s honorable but ugh… Ygritte was the only one who made him colorful. Without her he’s a shade of gray. Just the one. He doesn’t deserve more than that.  #GOT #GOTs8 #GOT8 #GameOfThronea #WinterIsHere #TeamDaenerys<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bodega_gyro_ao @MsPackyetti Only very recently I have started insisting people call me by correct name because it’s me and I get to decide who that is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bodega_gyro_ao @MsPackyetti I wish you were my teacher when I was a kid. I always saw my name as a burden and a joke for others. Too many teachers just said what they wanted with one even questioning me on the pronunciation. So I just stuck with the nickname, “Hari” (like the boy wizard).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kim01382358 @MsPackyetti @Alyssa_Milano The rich are taught the “standard” yet are never the majority. AAVE is one reflection of cultural identity. And as language does, it too will change over time. Remember: England spoke like Shakespeare. Language is beautiful!! But as I said, check your own Twitter first. 😘😘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kim01382358 @MsPackyetti @Alyssa_Milano It was the aristocracy taught that way and since passed down. Language diversifies as it isn’t centralised. Britain invaded the world &amp; changed native speech, so other cultures adapted, e.g. yours is US English, not “English”. Language is social, cultural, and economical.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kim01382358 @MsPackyetti @Alyssa_Milano Oh, heart. Please check your own Twitter before trying to correct anyone’s English. “Proper English” would be HM the Queen’s; yours definitely isn’t that. A lesson: The language you reference is elitist. Even in England most of the country has and will never speak that way.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The only reason I'm with @ODEONCinemas is because you're literally five minutes from my house. The reason I'm still with @cineworld, despite rarely going due to distance, is because I hope they'll locate a multiplex here, soon, so I can be done with you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can book for their screening of Shazam right now, and through @cineworld's regular function. I don't need a separate route, or a limited time frame, and I don't even have to line up to print tickets. Why is @ODEONCinemas' membership so terrible at being good to its members?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ODEONCinemas @ODEONHelp Why are your policies for Limitless booking (regarding Shazam) so ridiculous? I have to do it before 4pm?

<|startoftext|>Oh hun. As much as you’re normally an expert on racist behavior, “German” isn’t a race, hun. It’s a nationality. As a nationalist, hun, you should really know this. I’m worried, hun. You’re normally better than this, hun. 😘<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also if you’re calling it your birthright then it probably means you don’t have much vision to run on. You know who isn’t calling it their birthright? @ewarren @CoryBooker @SenGillibrand @KamalaHarris @PeteButtigieg and any other candidate with a platform.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Could someone tell @BetoORourke that calling something your birthright undermines the entire concept of America’s (false) meritocracy system. Should there even be an election since it was graced on your shoulders. That’s some special #whitemanprivilege there<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Dead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We can blame the parents and rightly so. But some could have used their privileges which screwed over more deserving kids because they wanted the best for their own. But I just want to hear more about the institutions that allowed this to happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The entire education system is corrupt and elitist. It has never been based on merit. It has never been fair. It has always lied and hidden the actual stories people should be learning and only telling the same white narrative in classes and rich values in its charter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don’t believe for a second these esteemed institutions would openly welcome Black &amp; Brown women &amp; men into their hallways so easily. They’re as white privileged as one can get. They want to have the tokens hidden among the sea of whiteness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So the whole #CollegeAdmissionsScam is clearly fucked. But everyone’s blaming the parents. Yes they should be held accountable. But why are so few talking about the institutions which have allowed systemic racism and sexism to go on even without the bribery?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeDelMoro Ah. We are so fucked over here. I need a way out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You should watch this right now.

<|startoftext|>That bullshit is for a court of law. But our #courtofculture knows there won’t always be hard evidence. We know there won’t be DNA on a woman’s breast and we shouldn’t need there to be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are tonnes of people who haven’t been proven guilty but you know they were culpable. The 2008 crash saw no convictions - you’re saying no one is guilty? How about those who chant lock her up to @HillaryClinton despite her being found innocent again and again by adversaries?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why would @TheMandyMoore need to lie about this? Or any other celebrated women? We choose to believe the men over the women - and that’s not neutrality. That’s choosing the assaulter over the assaulted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But at the end of it all, why would all these women lie? Why is it so much easier for ONE man, usually a rich straight cis guy, to be believed over a gathering of women? Why do you presume these heroes would step up and risk EVERYTHING to get their name in the paper?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You can then ask for an investigation and go through evidence and hope that something happens to put whomever away, to prove or disprove. But before that you have to believe the victim. You know police need to do this to ensure a thorough investigation, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And for the record: you can believe the victim, you can #BelieveWomen and not condemn the man; it says you hear their pain, you believe their history happened and that you want to give them space to exist and speak...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@minytrash @SkottJimenez @SamanthaRollins @phoebe_bridgers @TheMandyMoore “Let’s not automatically assume he’s guilty” essentially says “let’s not believe these women”.

<|startoftext|>@DrewTube I can understand that. I’m not trying to litigate the incident; as of now it wouldn’t hold in court (though the investigation isn’t done).

<|startoftext|>FWIW, discussions between #Harris #Warren #Booker &amp; #Gillibrand et al supporters are mostly respectful. When #Bernie fans come in the divisiveness is undeniable. It’s great you like his policies, but it’s become “with us or against us” Bush-era rhetoric now.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@janders9414 I agree about the burden of proof for the crime, but this isn’t going to court. This is about people, largely white supremacists, claiming a queer Black man lied for attention. All those saying it’s a hoax have yet to prove this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HDAlbanks @oo_roo_roo Your profile is fucked. Call Dems stupid cunts for all I care. But alluding autism as stupidity?! Their avg IQ is above national avg.

<|startoftext|>@DeplorableMeg Now feel free to respond with some nonsense bullshit about my making excuses, but that’s deflection. Remember? You‘ve made no considerations.

<|startoftext|>@DeplorableMeg - What was the chlorine content (it changes a lot about bleach) - The media said bleach. JS said some chemical. - Science: take a water bottle out in -9F. How fast did it freeze? You must consider variables; container, person holding it, TIME. You haven’t measured these. 2/3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeplorableMeg Slightest hint? Oh, dear. That’s not very factual now, is it? Does bleach freeze before 0F? Sure. But you, like many if your unintelligible comrades, continue to exclude basic factors: 1/3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeplorableMeg Oh sweetness. I’m not looking for your approval. What on earth made you think that was on the table? And I also love facts! I’d be excited to see some from you. But finding statements to fit your narrative isn’t really a fact though, so… be careful! 🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DeplorableMeg Hey Meg no need to hate on the selfies just because some of us are pretty enough to take them. Maybe one day you can too! You just have to take off the hate, bigotry and intolerance. It does WONDERS for your skin! #LifeHack 😉<|endoftext|>

Black people calling you “cracker” or “whitey” doesn’t evoke an entire history of hatred; the system protects white people, not Black people.  Also honey, I’ve reported your homophobia. Who hurt you to make you so fragile?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeltSean Just because you’re a racist, homophobic, fragile misogynist doesn’t give you a free pass for being an ignorant ass despite all the education you need being a single Google search away. Here’s something to save you a search: WHITES CANNOT EXPERIENCE RACISM FROM BLACK PEOPLE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oo_roo_roo I can’t say what happened to Jussie. All I have is his word, &amp; given the media climate it seems unlikely a well intentioned queer Black man chose to lie. However, Trump supporters demanding proof should ask why they don’t hold Trump to the same standard given his daily lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oo_roo_roo Actually it doesn’t sound like bullshit. Having been personally verbally abused by MAGA wearing men in Buffalo, I don’t dispute the claim. You can dislike it as a fact; I dislike the fact of misogyny, racism &amp; transphobia in the LGBTQ+ community, doesn’t mean it doesn’t happen.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#DEARWHITEPEOPLE  This #MLKDay - stop [mis]quoting &amp; [mis]using Rev. Dr. #MartinLutherKingJr’s words. Actions speak more than using words that don’t belong to us. It doesn’t even take much. Four ways to do the *barest* minimum:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>6/ To punish those boys we must also punish ourselves. We‘re all at fault. Until we, #whitepeople, change, we’re just perpetuating this cycle.  We need to check our #WhitePrivilege EVERY DAY. We need to use it to change our culture. And stop erasing everyone else.  #EndHate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>5/ Look at #racism and #sexism. We as a people (and by that I do mean #whitemen) have not done enough. There are SOME legal protections, sure, but barely any societal changes.  #ThisIsAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4/ But we should offer compassion; they were taught to be this way by their parents, their local community, and the society created by #whiteculture. We created this hate. #WhitePeople established a prejudicial standard and have done next to nothing to end it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3/ The #Covington boys’ actions are reprehensible, and they absolutely should be punished - as teenagers, they are not stupid. They should have the ability to know right from wrong.  #CovingtonCatholicHighHate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2/ Imagine if that skill was utilised for something good, like compassion, empathy, ending #whitesupremacy, genuinely creating an equitable society, and pushing for economic balance. Happy to know we white people have our priorities right.  #covingtoncatholicHS #MAGAyouth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1/ The excuses #whitepeople give ourselves in order to avoid being labeled #racist, but rather all in the name of #nationalsecurity, #nationalism or some other BS, is highly impressive.  #CovingtonCatholicSchool #CovingtonShame<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I’d go further: 100% of white people are racist in some measure. Even those more aware/understanding of racism have some inherent prejudice through systemic supremacy.

More annoying are #Bernie #Corbyn types who claim others are #elites despite both being in gov’t for decades. That makes them part of the establishment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremycorbyn’s main objective is being PM, not solving the existential problem facing the UK today: Brexit - where NO OUTCOME OF LEAVING will make the country better off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#JeremyCorbyn… like… fuck off. General election is your main focus (wonder the fuck why!!)  but seems very haphazard about any #peoplesvote.  How can people like him? The majority of the Left want to #remain but St. Jeremy has regularly resisted this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And what will #Corbin actually do for the UK through #Brexit? His only real platform is “I will be Prime Minister”. He wants Brexit to happen. If he was quite the “man of the people” that his supporters want to believe he is then he’d push for a #PeoplesVote #secondreferendum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know, at some point people need to just say that @jeremycorbyn is power hungry, desperate to be PM to do things his way. What evidence is there that #Labour will win a general election? If they do, what certainty is there it’ll be a big enough majority?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Dear @GOP / @HouseGOP: If you don’t see this as a problem you are fools. Women make up more than 6.5% of your votes, but are 6.5% of your seats in the #USHouse. How about maybe you fix this?  #GOP #Republicans #WomenInPolitics #RepublicanWomen #HouseOfRepresentatives #116Congress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lovewave_sw @SenSanders Which is a fair. But his economic message was broad &amp; didn’t look at anything beyond class divisions, ignoring race &amp; gender as variables. His RE message is powerful, but my point in the thread is his white/male privilege let issues like paygap in his campaign to be overlooked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If that’s you, cool. But that graph doesn’t show how different people are impacted, just broad #incomeinequality. Not sure how one can call themselves progressive if they ignore that some people, based on nothing but their #race/#gender, will be paid less if given a job at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How about instead we look to a #WomanOfColor to lead? Because maybe looking at the systemic disadvantage placed on the most disenfranchised citizens, &amp; raising them up to parity might actually make real change to helps everyone &amp; not just the caucasians with the XY chromosome. //<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDemocrats need someone who is able to speak a wide range of people from a multitude of backgrounds. #Bernie’s message did not go far enough, and most certainly was not as progressive as he or the #BernieBros rampaged.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I truly hope #Bernie does not run. His message excited a lot of young people and that can be his legacy. But it’s time to stop this white washing of America’s economic problems, stop assuming that fixing it for white WC men will solve it for everyone (the essence of his platform)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So let’s go back to the narrative of #whitemalesavior: Bernie was able to have this ignored, partly because he was the underdog, but also because it was more fun to analyze every move made by the woman in the race. Had this occurred in her campaign there‘d be weeks of coverage.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So to say that gender was never a factor is a brazen level of #maleblindness and #WhitePrivilege, and knowing it is from the “progressive” candidate’s campaign is even more alarming. Note: I have not mentioned the other toxic ways the campaign operated on. Read for your self.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now we’re supposed to excuse this because the Bernie campaign grew faster than anyone could have expected. But these people were professionals; not hiring enough staff, or too many, or choosing poor staff is natural. But pay is pretty clearcut. You earn based on the role.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And the campaign committee outlined how pay was differentiated; based on experience and job role. This does not explain why a woman’s male subordinate was paid more. Why was he even her subordinate if his experience and job role required a 50% increase in pay?  https://t.co/TwNIth22Iy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Bernie’s senior female staff at times were paid 50% less than their male subordinates. Not even #equalwork #equalpay, but less work more pay. Again - this is #DemocraticSocialist Bernie’s campaign.  https://t.co/vPEdjwlA6o<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So when the @nytimes publishes a piece about the massive #paygap between women &amp; men on his campaign staff, I am both stunned that the man labeled as the economic savior has brought in people who allowed this to happen (which would imply a lack of built-in organizational values).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He failed to highlight the incredible #genderpaygap between #womenofcolor &amp; white men, which is rampant across all economic classes. His message was simple; the rich had too much &amp; the working class too little. He failed to really note racism &amp; sexism built into the economy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bernie’s campaign was about economic equality; about ensuring people had better wages and that the top 1% didn’t own everything. This was a great, and broad, message. It’s easy to get behind. But what Bernie neglected was the specific injustices around the US economic disparity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But they didn’t even try to cover it up that well. Things were glossed over as they are in most industries around the world. #Women were expected to just get on with work - which they did - despite the toxic environment that plagued their day-to-day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There has always been mention of he sexism, racism and general toxic masculinity that was embedded in his campaign. And it seemed to be at all levels, not just the lower ranks. I would like to mention that nobody has declared Sanders’ knowledge of this and I won’t speak to that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have a few thoughts on #Bernie2020.  His campaign bothered me for the simple fact I am tired of the same “old white man will save the day/lead the charge”. Bernie’s message wasn’t the best - his #whiteprivilege &amp; male-ness allowed his voice to speak louder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congrats indeed to #Bolsonaro, @NikkiHaley. How “great” it is  to strip back LGBTQ+ rights, after saying he’d rather his son die than be gay, to threaten murder against opposition, label Black people as animals, &amp; encourage rape &amp; violence against women. It’s fan-FUCKING-tastic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That look is savage! #NewYearsResolutions<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The First Amendment allows you to SAY hateful slurs. It doesn’t ABSOLVE you from consequences. “I didn’t mean it” - you didn’t mean to get caught “My life is ruined” - you’re white, you’ll be fine. #ToxicMasculinity &amp; #WhitePrivilege on display  https://t.co/379pM4C8Ca<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ryukudla @retrocoldplay …even when “playful”, &amp; do something about it. Someone else said that if you were a woman there‘d be no discussion on the question of harassment; it definitely is. You’re a seemingly strong gay man, but how might they question a transperson? Microaggressions can grow into more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ryukudla @retrocoldplay That‘s reasonable; spare the pain &amp; anguish for a short term rotation. But what about those who aren’t on rotation, or who may struggle to carry on? You can say something to HR without formal complaint so they are aware of the detriment this can have on some colleagues…<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Racism, yes, but also sexism &amp; internalized homo/trans/bi/queerphobia. There is way too much LGBTQ+ “leadership” from cis white gay men.

<|startoftext|>When your default reaction is:  “Disgusted, &amp; yet completely unsurprised.”  Also unsurprising: @Twitter’s lack of comment or reaction.

<|startoftext|>@HillarityPress @LukeSides29 @GayPatriot @Mikel_Jollett So really @LukeSides29 isn’t wrong. Nice try. You failed to list how constitutional amendments would be needed. Nobody said it would be easy, or that a super majority wouldn’t be needed. But maybe you shouldn’t shout down someone as “wrong” without actually disproving them?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HillarityPress @LukeSides29 @GayPatriot @Mikel_Jollett BTW most doctors are not refusing to see Medicaid patients. That’s incorrect and no evidence nor trends suggest otherwise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HillarityPress @LukeSides29 @GayPatriot @Mikel_Jollett That means the provider has access. The main issue is ensuring options for people to choose from, &amp; no one has said private care would be abolished. MfA would be optional (just like most nations offer). Saying expansion would be unconstitutional is further right wing propaganda.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HillarityPress @LukeSides29 @GayPatriot @Mikel_Jollett Medicare for all is actually uncertain. But medical privacy is already protected by HIPAA &amp; is designed to be flexible; information can be shared where needed. The gov’t already accesses it for public health purposes anyway. But so do private insurers who use it for claims.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HillarityPress @LukeSides29 @GayPatriot @Mikel_Jollett The constitution gives POTUS specified &amp; clearly defined powers. The broad scope of executive overreach is what is being discussed. Since FDR, POTUS power/executive branch has grown drastically. *That* needs to be end. No one says to limit that constitutionally handed to POTUS.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It’s particularly funny since he asked in an earlier tweet why these women don’t come forward earlier.

<|startoftext|>@JRD0000 @serenawilliams @Naomi_Osaka_ The point is that women, especially black women, are held to a higher standard and punished more for their actions, especially when they call it out. If this was two men we wouldn’t be talking about it because men are treated differently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JRD0000 @serenawilliams @Naomi_Osaka_ The point I made is her reaction doesn’t matter - women are expected to behave in a way that appeases men. Male tennis stars have verbally abused &amp; sworn at umpires, smashing racquets, and didn’t receive either the punishment Serena did or the narrative that she is a sore loser.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Neither @serenawilliams nor @Naomi_Osaka_ were treated fairly. One man’s power-trip over the two women prevented both athletes from knowing what the fair outcome would have been, win or lose. #SerenaWilliams #NaomiOsaka #USOpen #BlackWomen #WomenInSport  https://t.co/5mepAIn1Iv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A whole lotta this:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MsPackyetti is quite possibly my favorite woman.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#SerenaVsOsaka #SerenavsNaomi #SerenavsTheWorld #SerenaWillams #NaomiOsaka #USOpen2018<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you for showing us the importance of standing up for yourself, for your show of determination, and your utter brilliance for you pushing @Naomi_Osaka_ onto the pedestal she deserves. You are strong. You are kind. And you are adored. 🏆🙌🏿🎾🙌🏾🎾🙌🏽🎾🙌🏼🎾🙌🏻🏆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Know that you are a hero to millions and that we admire, adore and, chiefly, respect you for your charm, optimism, and constant class. Congratulations to you for being you. You didn’t win, and even if you wouldn’t have beaten Ms. Osaka, you deserve better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And to @serenawilliams - a woman who carries herself with both fierce determination and idyllic grace: you are a Queen👸🏿. You have done more for tennis than most of your peers - men and women - ever could.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congratulations to #NaomiOsaka 🎾🎉🏆🥇🏆🎉🎾<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ms. Osaka deserves better for her first #GrandSlam win. She played well and took on a giant, one of the best athletes in the world. To her, I hope you find the joy in your win. You should have been able to win fairly without an umpire imposing his will upon you and your opponent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And then when it’s all over, and whether or not Ms. Williams would have beaten or succumbed to @Naomi_Osaka_, her win is mudded by the media, tennis officials, spectators; literally everyone including myself is talking about how Ms. Williams was treated and whether it was unfair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That isn’t to say all white men abuse the system they play in themselves; but they are rewarded disproportionately for good or bad behavior. They are treated with a respect women and women of color specifically never receive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are LITERALLY thousands of examples in sport alone where men have reacted with physical aggression against referees and umpires, who have hurled verbal abuse at those who disallow points, goals, etc. and who get warnings. Especially when these players are white men.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To call her our as being too #angryblackwoman is a form of prejudice that black women are all too familiar with. Women generally are ridiculed for showing emotion. Black women are penalized further for showing an ounce of frustration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And it has happened to all women of color for too long, including last night when @serenawilliams dared to stand up for herself against an umpire who abused his position. In a way it perfect illustrates how a patriarchal and racist system abuses women - black women in particular.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was said of @HillaryClinton who had the audacity to run for presidential office in a country which likes to pretend how free and equal it is, and then beats her into the mud, while continuing to get angry because she refuses to react in the way they want all women to behave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was said of any woman who ran for any local, regional, or national position in politics because she dared to step out of line by trying to rule over men, or whatever fragile thing too many people (men) believe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was said of women who attempted to climb the ranks in business, trying to break down every glass ceiling forced above them, while still making a fraction of the pay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was said of suffragettes by wide numbers of people for being too disruptive, violent, aggressive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It was said of women scientists throughout the 19th and 20th centuries when they discovered something, which was often then labelled as man’s discovery<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The first women of anything - any industry or political engagement, art, or whatever - will always be seen as being: - too emotional - too angry - not following the rules - arrogance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@serenawilliams is a Queen. If you think how she reacted, what she said, and everything in between was wrong, then you’re not listening.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kaspervol @BillKristol I really don’t know where you get your opinions (because buddy, these are not facts - check with historians) but you need to wise up. The knowledge is there. Learn it. Use it. Most of the good white men did was to undo the travesties they committed in the first place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kaspervol @BillKristol Democrats were once the conservative party. Republicans were liberal FOR THEIR TIME (even Lincoln wasn’t sure black &amp; white people could live together peacefully). That switched once Democratic presidents from FDR on changed their views &amp; pushed bit by bit for equality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kaspervol @BillKristol You’re the kind of guy who throws a party for a 14 year old bully who terrorizes his classmates all because he apologized at the end. Like that undoes all the hurt. White men had to be shamed into undoing the mess they caused. Most white men are conservatives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kaspervol @BillKristol You realize straight men kept homosexuals from being allowed to be themselves, and so were the only ones who could undo the bigotry, right?  You realize that white men still have most of the power and still haven’t undone all the pain they cause, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kaspervol @BillKristol You realize only men could give women the vote after keeping them as second class citizens for thousands of years, right?

<|startoftext|>@kaspervol @BillKristol You realize those men kept slavery, right? You realize there was no Democratic Party in the late 1700s, right?

<|startoftext|>Also, your story is bullshit. With @jeremycorbyn leading Labour, there’s no way they will do anything to reject Brexit. He’s as weak willed as your damn paper.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does that make it right? Or easy to execute? People are free to be ignorant but our elected leaders are not. Their job is to lead us even if it’s against the majority, so long as they do the right damn thing. /7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They are the servants, and in being such their job is to ensure Britons are cared for, that no real harm is done to them.

<|startoftext|>…given no actual info on the plan? And still we have no plan in place. And how is this subverting democracy? MPs are PAID to do a job. I can vote for my doctor to make me well, but the doctor, being the expert, needs to make sure she makes me better in the smoothest way. /5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Could you tell me what they voted for? Other than “Brexit”? Because no one - no one - had any real plan on what it meant. Gove, Johnson and Farage had very different views on it, and they were the leading proponents. So what exactly were 17m people voting for, since they were...  https://t.co/ejKjkA15Fr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...to ensure the best deal is reached? Yeah, I hope they do delay it then instead of going in with no fucking plan, no fucking clue. But yes. They are evil, subverting the will of the people. /4  https://t.co/AmzlCnxPru<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>What exactly is straightforward about Brexit? I mean - are you willfully that ignorant? Are all your “reporters”?

<|startoftext|>@sunnya527 @Hey_its_Stefhan Yes. But how much more rape would happen if we didn’t ban it? Somehow I think it would be a hell of a lot higher than it is. People can be awful and do shitty things, that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t attempt to put rules in place to stop them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sunnya527 @Hey_its_Stefhan But I do agree with you. We shouldn’t single out one gun. So long as people are too easily able to get their hands on weapons they do not need and kill other people, other parents’ children, other people’s husbands and wives, mothers and fathers, then we should ban all guns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sunnya527 @Hey_its_Stefhan There were only so many deaths with people not wearing seat belts and we fixed that. There were only so many bombs before we stopped that. We regulate shit for the better of everyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sunnya527 @Hey_its_Stefhan So we should allow rape, incest and drunk driving? Terrorists only hijacked four planes on 9/11 yet 17 years later I still have to go through all the extra security to board planes.

<|startoftext|>@OneTrutherator @saffa27 “Trutherator” can’t seem to stick to the discussion at hand which isn’t on foreign policy but on the joke that an armed civilian militia would ever have the chance to take down the US government. But cool, you tell your own story. I’ll pretend I’m listening<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So much YES to this.  Naomi Wadler, I have so much respect for you.  https://t.co/2j7JE6jxPL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OneTrutherator @saffa27 You know this argument has nothing to do with what I was talking about, right? I said the US govt is too powerful for civilians to overthrow it by force. Therefore the clause in the second amendment is irrelevant. Much like you bringing Saddam Hussein into the discussion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OneTrutherator @saffa27 Well then you should be against the gov’t possessing nuclear weapons and tanks. Because there’s no civilian militia - an untrained, inconsistent unit compared to a regulated force - that can take down a government in the modern era. Protest is the only way things have changed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe then politicians could focus on something other than ridiculous gun debates and do something to fucking feed people food and cure them of entirely curable diseases. /rant<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stop blaming the fucking people who commit murder as having mental problems, and start calling out anyone who thinks owning a weapon is the most important fucking thing in the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It’d be funny to watch though, I’m not going to lie. These dipshit white men, crying away when someone bullshits some comment from the left about gun control, trying to act tough as they come face to face with a tank.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“But armed militia!”  You could have 1,000,000 AR15s, the US military owns tanks, jets a brutal, trained human force, and a nuclear fucking arsenal. What the fuck are you going to do to overthrow that? Are you out of your fucking mind?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is simple mathematics so fucking difficult for Americans to understand? HOW ARE GUNS MORE OF A RIGHT THAN HUMAN LIVES, HUMAN HEALTH, HUMAN WELFARE, THE ABILITY TO LIVE AND BE HAPPY?! This obsession with guns doesn’t make you free, it imprisons you into a fucked system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“But I need it to defend!” When A gets a gun to defend their home to deter B, B gets a gun too. A then wants a bigger gun. But then so does B. And that’s the cycle. If A didn’t have a gun because it was difficult for everyone to get one then it’s unlikely B would get one too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But killing one person is still a fucking problem, one no other developed nation has. So instead of nit picking the guns to ban how about America grows the fuck up and BANS THEM ALL.  To value a weapon designed to hunt and kill more than the safety of people is inconceivable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And honestly, I’m so fucking tired of hearing people say “we don’t want to take your guns - but there should be checks for all, and bans for assault style ones”  No! No no no!  All guns a problem. Killing one person with a handgun is better than killing 17 or 49 or 59 - yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People who commit murder with military-styled assault rifles are blamed for having mental challenges.  I would argue this is incorrect. Anyone who wants to own a damn weapon like this has some kind of problem.  There is no reason to want one. None. You’d have to be fucking crazy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It's not my business and has nothing to do with me, and I completely support women getting to make that choice for themselves.

<|startoftext|>I'm also not really in favor of abortions. I don't see a fetus or potential life, I see a baby. But I absolutely do not get an opinion on what a woman does to her body.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lamb isn't personally in favor of abortions, but he refuses to infringe on a woman's choice to have one; he thinks they should be legal even after the 20th week and disavows the label “pro-life.” Why are we so obsessed with politicians needing to all align themselves uniformly?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Regardless of personal feelings one should want others to be and feel healthy, happy and safe. There's also the fact it's literally called "pro-choice"; people can choose to have an abortion or not and it's no one else's business.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't really understand all this hate for @ConorLambPA because he's personally opposed to abortion… His stance is the same as millions: not pro, but advocates for women to have legal access. Isn't that what we should all want?<|endoftext|>

There. Is. Nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DefundtheRINOS @Dreamsicle14 @HillaryClinton So is it her fault they died or her fault it was “covered up”?

<|startoftext|>@brycedkelley @RossDolson @oujamon @dblsuited @iain993 @astroanimated @Mr_LukeBenson @itswildrich @MarkmurrayIV @ladymisskate How was it the reason? It passed congress &amp; went to the states before war broke out. They didn't start fighting *because* of CA.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ating85 @Joe_363_ Also a lot of people don't consider themselves British. My family's from Belfast and they would only call themselves Irish.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@frogman888 @myfanpleasure @efabianvalero @_measly @NastyNEGirl @MrDane1982 @Wicker1M I understand all that. The argument is DNC was biased. My Q is why wouldn't they be?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@myfanpleasure @efabianvalero @_measly @frogman888 @NastyNEGirl @MrDane1982 @Wicker1M Nothing wrong with that but you can't complain about DNC when you don't want to be in it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@myfanpleasure @efabianvalero @_measly @frogman888 @NastyNEGirl @MrDane1982 @Wicker1M He wanted to change the party and couldn't so he quit and became Indy again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@myfanpleasure @efabianvalero @_measly @frogman888 @NastyNEGirl @MrDane1982 @Wicker1M They had a preference for a woman who was a Dem for decades. Bernie was a Dem for five minutes. And then he switched back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@myfanpleasure @efabianvalero @_measly @frogman888 @NastyNEGirl @MrDane1982 @Wicker1M Who said they're impartial? They're the DNC. They support democrats. They're technically supposed to be impartial<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FunnyPutin @itsGower @Coodehtony @parkerpen91 @xjnaaaa @Sabrina_Arsenal Seems I hit a nerve. Come along now. I can teach you our gay ways. 😘💅🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FunnyPutin @itsGower @Coodehtony @parkerpen91 @xjnaaaa @Sabrina_Arsenal He runs it like an authoritarian homophobe. And you know what they say about guys who are that homophobic… 🙊<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shallowpools You literally make no sense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GT13Dr @cristinalaila1 Though I guarantee you'll respond to have the last word. So… have fun with that big man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GT13Dr @cristinalaila1 You're ignorance is tiring. Apparently a discussion is beyond you. So good luck with your narrow mind. I'm done trying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GT13Dr @cristinalaila1 Plus Republican courts concurred that it was unconstitutional<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GT13Dr @cristinalaila1 It's hard to ignore his business interests in the nations he ignored.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GT13Dr @cristinalaila1 Actually my issue is that he chose countries which hadn't committed terror attacks. Saudi Arabia wasn't on that list despite 9/11.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GT13Dr @cristinalaila1 You know there are literally no new ideas on the right as well, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GT13Dr @cristinalaila1 Principles are good. But politics is about compromise to make the best descision for everyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GT13Dr @cristinalaila1 And this is why political difference will never be respected. Neither side is willing to listen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GT13Dr @cristinalaila1 13- you may assume we disagree massively but I bet we actually only disagree on what to do next or how to respond /end<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GT13Dr @cristinalaila1 12- I do not excuse any religious violence, including Islam, because violence is bad regardless of who or what or why.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GT13Dr @cristinalaila1 11- world peace will never happen, but when we treat attacks by one race/religion as worse than an other, we have serious issues<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GT13Dr @cristinalaila1 10- last night &amp; all other attacks are disgusting, as are attacks by white christians against other races (rarely labeled as "terrorism")<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GT13Dr @cristinalaila1 9- that doesn't mean we shouldn't try to figure out better solutions than just bombing and being bombed back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GT13Dr @cristinalaila1 8- I'm a lefty who wanted military intervention to stop dictators from using chemical weapons against their civilians<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GT13Dr @cristinalaila1 7- launching attacks is a more centrist/right wing agenda than left which pushes for more diplomacy, which yes doesn't always work either<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GT13Dr @cristinalaila1 6- violence doesn't fix violent acts. Most on the left agree something needs to be done but not just running in and throwing grenades<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GT13Dr @cristinalaila1 5- we need to do something to stop threats but bombing the ME isn't going to fix it. ISIS came after AQ. Something will come after this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GT13Dr @cristinalaila1 4- I won't blame all muslims the way I won't blame all Germans for nazis or all white Americans for slavery.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GT13Dr @cristinalaila1 3- People want to jump on the "muslims are evil" bandwagon despite 90+% of muslims not acting on violent crimes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GT13Dr @cristinalaila1 2- extremism in any religion which kills others is an abomination. Islam included. Christianity included.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GT13Dr @cristinalaila1 1- the attackers are abhorrent regardless of race or religion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GT13Dr @cristinalaila1 Talk about selective reading. Cool. Happy to discuss when you're able to read the whole article and not just keywords.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GT13Dr @cristinalaila1 And quite frankly the Brits have committed more and worse crimes throughout history than most other nations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GT13Dr @cristinalaila1 Otherwise I'd have to hate all Germans for Nazis, all Americans for slavery, all Brits for Empire.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GT13Dr @cristinalaila1 I'm not willing to blame over a billion people for be acts of a few.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GT13Dr @cristinalaila1 Those who committed the attacks are inexcusable and despicable and need to have the full force of law come down on them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GT13Dr @cristinalaila1 See, there seems to be a confusion between me saying I don't blame Muslims, and you thinking I excuse Islamist attacks. Not the same thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GT13Dr @cmclymer What is fascism?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Today on social media:  "THE ANSWER IS MORE VIOLENCE"  Because that will definitely work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GT13Dr @cristinalaila1 Aggressive agendas fucking over people in the ME. If that was done to a western nation there'd be no question of retribution.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GT13Dr @cristinalaila1 They didn't just up and decide to blow people up. A little thing called blowback.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GT13Dr @cristinalaila1 I'm not saying a left movement will fix everything, but continuing the same way isn't helping.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GT13Dr @cristinalaila1 Most foreign policies are of the conservative/right leaning ideology. So far it's done nothing preventative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GT13Dr @cristinalaila1 Says the pillock who voted for Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GT13Dr @cristinalaila1 Nope. Not at all. Happy with my vote and I'd do it again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cristinalaila1 Also, if London is Islamic, then why would they need to launch attacks on themselves when it would make better sense to attack elsewhere?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cristinalaila1 I'm catholic and I voted for Sadiq Khan. Please explain.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Coodehtony @itsGower @parkerpen91 @xjnaaaa @Sabrina_Arsenal And finally, the bible. Condones slavery, torture, murder and abuse. Yet we don't blame all christians for the actions of a few fools.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Coodehtony @itsGower @parkerpen91 @xjnaaaa @Sabrina_Arsenal You can't point to all Muslims because of the actions of a few. Textbook definition of racism. Men chose to do these things, not a religion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Coodehtony @itsGower @parkerpen91 @xjnaaaa @Sabrina_Arsenal If half of them behaved as extremists then we'd be having a far bigger problem. We're talking about percentiles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Coodehtony @itsGower @parkerpen91 @xjnaaaa @Sabrina_Arsenal Men choose to pick up weapons. Men choose to corrupt others into believing in something most cannot fathom. There are a billion Muslims.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Coodehtony @itsGower @parkerpen91 @xjnaaaa @Sabrina_Arsenal No god has made anyone ever obey rules. People chose to. Men chose. Men choose to pick and choose parts of holy scripture to obey.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Coodehtony @itsGower @parkerpen91 @xjnaaaa @Sabrina_Arsenal Holy shit. It is not the fault of Islam. Who made anyone do those things? No god has ever forced anyone to commit murder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Coodehtony @parkerpen91 @itsGower @xjnaaaa @Sabrina_Arsenal You keep telling yourself that buddy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamManie Men abuse religions. That's the difference. We may be more progressive but we're not all that different. We're lucky to have more choice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamManie The bible condones slavery and torture, and pretty much thinks all women are subject to man with the sole purpose of use for man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamManie No, people who abuse religion are wrong. No one made them do this. No god threatened them. They chose or were conditioned to believe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamManie Good luck with your head up your arse. I'll leave this conversation with you recognising me as a good guy. Literally there in your tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamManie "They're probably black, it's their MO &amp; it's disgusting - black people must be stopped". Tell me you don't have a problem with these terms<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamManie My problem is when you focus on them being Muslim. Imagine they were black and you said:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamManie We don't even make note of it being terrorism most of the time. I didn't say they weren't Muslim extremists, I said we just don't know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamManie The focus on them being Muslim is the problem. We don't focus on Christian terrorism as being Christian.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamManie All we're doing is exacerbating the racist, hate mongering, allowing for better, easier to understand headlines.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamManie We don't all know! That's the point! I don't care if they're Muslim or Christian. It makes no difference. The punishment should be the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Coodehtony @parkerpen91 @itsGower @xjnaaaa @Sabrina_Arsenal I could also select some choice videos about white culture and it's violent ways, but I'm tired of ignorance and just can't be arsed anymore<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamManie It's definitely their MO. It's also the MO of hundreds of white men who have slaughtered people. But we'll ignore that history for now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@parkerpen91 @itsGower @Coodehtony @xjnaaaa @Sabrina_Arsenal I guarantee you'll find Britons who go to church, were brought up in Christian communities &amp; baptised who don't call themselves "Christian".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaptainBritanic Tottenham's best season in PL and they still are just "almost rans". Our worst ever and we won a cup and only finished fifth..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamManie Oh, snowflake. Did I touch a nerve? Sorry I'm not as ignorant as you, or won't throw out racist remarks. Sorry I can't be like you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamManie Ignorance offends me. I'm sorry you're so delicate it upset you snowflake. I'd love to tell you the story of a kettle &amp; pot but out of space<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joe_363_ …reports, people were jumping in with shit about Islam. Not even specifying extremism. And that's a problem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joe_363_ I don't care if they're Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheist or elephants. I want them stopped and arrested. But within minutes after initial…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joe_363_ Didn't say it did. But people jumping to that conclusion &amp; using it to continue their vile language against a billion people is disgraceful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamManie I want them caught and arrested and the book thrown at them. I don't care who or what they are. I want it stopped. The fact is we don't know<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamManie Making excuses for whom? Please point out where I made an excuse? It's people like you who prove ignorance is far too prominent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamManie Deluded? For saying don't jump to conclusions?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>President Cunthead says what? Literal disgrace Ls&amp;Gs. Literal. Fucking. Disgrace.  https://t.co/CpkkPcKsMx<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ODEONCinemas, since @cineworld are pretty awful, what're the benefits of a #Limitless card? Lots of articles are a year old. Updates?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cineworld Once again showing your great customer service skills… No real apology for my inconvenience, no attempt to resolve. Cheers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cineworld @ODEONCinemas Your staff are slow, not all that polite and I just don't think you're worth the money anymore.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cineworld ...when we had other proof of Unlimited documentation. I literally spend hundreds &amp; hundreds of pounds every year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cineworld This is LITERALLY the first time in about 10 months I was asked to show my card. And to be spoken to like that is absurd...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cineworld Yes, my brother shouldn't have forgotten his, but to be told I had to have a red piece of plastic or pay  MORE money is insane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cineworld And despite him having emails for the card &amp; me having proof I pay for TWO cards every month, I was told none of that matters.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TylerPedigoKY I love your insight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JetBlue no I'm in buffalo. I thought it was in my bag so didn't think to double check the seat, like an idiot. It's a silver pen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JetBlue hi. I think I may have lost my insulin on the plane. Was on the 10:50p 468 JFK to ROC. Who do I get in touch with to find out?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just listening to this on repeat. #ImWithHer #Hillary #Clinton #DemsInPhilly #FightSong…  https://t.co/pvXjsiVCQC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@boingo bit late now 😑 I'm in the air. It took me over two hours to use your wifi to send that tweet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JetBlue by the way your wifi at terminal 5 JFK sucks. Full signal yet I can't do anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JetBlue did you get my dm?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JetBlue what time does it land?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JetBlue ????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JetBlue is that just to Rochester or can I get a connection to buffalo from there?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JetBlue by the way the floor is super nice. You should come and join me. I'll be the guy with no where to go<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JetBlue and of course you'll ignore all these tweets as like so many other big wig corps you give zero fucks about the people who pay you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JetBlue so now I sit on the airport floor without any help to stay somewhere, knowing I can't go back to the city as now my flight is early<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JetBlue risking a potential diabetic issue. But it's OK because the weather excuses you from helping passengers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JetBlue so your suggestion is to let my bag fly off to buffalo with my medication but I wait behind until I get on the flight at 6:30<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JetBlue except you need to take my bag. Spoiler: I'm a diabetic. My insulin is in my luggage as its too much to take through security<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JetBlue then I get told I can be put on hold for a later flight (because apparently the weather isn't messing with a flight in five hours)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JetBlue you think this is an OK way to operate? Really? Fucking over a passenger because you're too cheap to offer ANY sort of compensation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JetBlue IT'S NOT MY FAULT THE PLANE ISN'T FLYING EITHER. So I'm out of pocket for cab and now I'll have to pay for hotel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JetBlue please explain how you think this is ok. You say it's not your fault but you can't offer a place to stay because hey! Guess what!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JetBlue but I won't be given compensation because "weather" so I can't afford a hotel. So I'm currently sat at terminal with no where to go<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JetBlue only available flight now is at 6:30 tomorrow morning. I can't go back to the city because i won't get back in time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JetBlue yet other flights going up to buffalo are still OK. So why is this flight cancelled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JetBlue get to airport and find out flight is cancelled. No warning. No text. No email. Because of weather<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JetBlue so I booked a cab to get me to JFK as the subway was running slow. Email at 2:30 said everything was running smoothly.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PennyDreadful81 @DaytonDoes but it does condone slavery and death for working on the sabbath.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PennyDreadful81 @zachtratar "as a whole"?? Bible promotes slavery, death to non believers, subjugation of women, hate towards gays…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PennyDreadful81 @DaytonDoes history where Christians react violently, murderously because of the content from the Bible (2/2)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PennyDreadful81 @DaytonDoes while it may not specifically say believers should act on that, there are numerous instances throughout (1/2)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PennyDreadful81 @DaytonDoes also the NT calls for the death or torture or destruction of all non-believers multiple times.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DareToMesut Need to play like this more. Sort out the finishing, but that solid form was brilliant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If we play this way for the rest of the season we could clear up the double.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@signorbump Think about it. We have 41 goals, and about 20 clear-cut chances. We'd dominate this League. Better CF or better coaching needed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@signorbump just need one of them to learn to finish. So may wasted efforts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If we beat or draw against Spurs, United and City then we will not have lost a game against the top 5, assuming it'll be the same teams.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@signorbump Saying that, if we manage to beat them at WHL then I think it's ours.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@signorbump I'd prefer a City win tbh. It's OK either way, but I can't handle Spuds finishing above us. Would rather be 3rd &amp; have City win<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theEpicGooner Too much abuse for the miss. If it was a forward it's warranted but his job isn't to score. Agree, he had a good game.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDjole A trip?!?! Should have stayed home 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDjole was in tears at the end. We really need someone to be better at finishing. We'd dominate if we converted more chances.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDjole Just imagine if we held on at Liverpool, beat Chelsea and got a result against Southampton at home… We'd be 5 points clear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDjole I hate myself for it, but what Chelsea beating us 2-0 away, then 1-0 at home?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Romul87 what's the job?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toddlerlex @stephanjbee the movement for Sanders has swept across rural states like IA &amp; NH but still trails quite far in most others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toddlerlex @stephanjbee republicans don't have a chance at POTUS. Romney/Obama was meant to be close and ended up 100 votes different.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yay. Dentist. Excited. Best day.   #Sarcasm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiageoLiam because they don't have the decency to do anything about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiageoLiam it will never be banned. The tax is too good. All the politicians are fucking around with "banning in cars with kids"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDjole good luck! :)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDjole that works for me! Less competition to get in! Haha. You still studying for the exam?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDjole haha I have the same problems with moving to the US<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ozilaccuracy @Bellerined @ZizouZelalem isn't it past your bedtime or something?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bellerined @Ozilaccuracy @ZizouZelalem also Di Maria has been bad since he left Madrid. His use is letting fools like you bitch even more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bellerined @Ozilaccuracy @ZizouZelalem also I mentioned Messi. Agüero, Costa and Di Maria are not Messi. Or close.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ozilaccuracy @Bellerined @ZizouZelalem I don't think you understand how transfers work. Otherwise Chelsea, City &amp; Utd would have everyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ozilaccuracy @Bellerined @ZizouZelalem "just fucking get him" why not go for Messi while we're at it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ozilaccuracy @Bellerined @ZizouZelalem Also Lukaku? You for real? If he's better than OG he's marginal. You yourself said WC. Lukaku is not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ozilaccuracy @Bellerined @ZizouZelalem  Wenger made bad decisions today. But who is better than him who is available? Tell us?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDjole hahaha very good. Dad's from Cyprus. Was born near Milton Keynes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDjole Ain't that the way! Where are you from?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDjole really? you're English seems pretty excellent. better than a lot of english people on here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Harry Kane has a mouth full of semen or something in that post-match interview.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiamGeorge_ Flamini?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDjole Aah! Just to make the evening more fun!! Hope it goes well! What's it on?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Matflam He's "too tired", not injured. Could have played 45mins then Coq. Or just increase attacking options. Either way Flam needs dumping<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDjole I'm usually this optimistic. Just knackered &amp; angry. I think I'd be happier if we lost the game. So many chances. Nothing to show.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDjole I want to think so. I'm mostly worried Spurs will finish above us. Our squad is better, but they're solid &amp; have confidence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDjole we just need someone who can finish. I don't care if he cost five or fifty million. Giroud is great but too many games he isn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDjole This is the Arsenal way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDjole We'll have a shit January. Then we'll be slow in Feb. Then we'll go on a mass winning streak when it's too late to claw it back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDjole they had to wake up after Liverpool. Had to wake up after Stoke. Had to wake up after Chelsea. It's a pattern.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Matflam  @Arsenal YOU BOUGHT ELNENY FOR A REASON. WE HAVE COQ. WENGER CAN FUCK OFF FOR THIS DECISION.  https://t.co/m6XW4SnIBE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDjole We'd be lucky to only lose by 4-0 on aggregate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDjole Really? I'm so tired of this club. WHY CAN'T THEY JUST PLAY WELL ENOUGH?! We always do this. Barcelona will destroy us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Matflam @theowalcott @aaronramsey   https://t.co/QXmwvdBqBn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wilshoholic and is scared to let him leave, paying him over 100K a week<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>FUCK YOU @Arsenal  DO YOUR FANS A FAVOUR AND FUCK OFF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WHY IS FLAMINI EVEN ON THE FUCKING PITCH?!?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoonerGordo @FA "Same old Arsenal, always cheating"<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LeWookieGooner is Elneny injured? Why is Flamini even in the squad? I understand not rushing Coq in but where's Elneny?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eolaoire I read somewhere it was three. Wondered why it was extreme. Figured that was why everyone was so up in arms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eolaoire Cyprus.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@toddlerlex so does everyone. doesn't make you an idiot. just means you don't know absolutely everything in the world. unlike me… *cough*<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dezzaxx_ agree she hasn't got the greatest voice but what she does have is soul. Beyoncé has a pretty voice, not much else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dezzaxx_ woman is an actual artist and musician as opposed to the Beyoncés and Rihannas of the world<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dezzaxx_ she's a diamond. Best RnB/Soul singer out there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheGunners247 better than arteta as he's actually ON the pitch every game, and Per who fumbles too much. Not convinced with Santi as third<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheGunners247 makes sense!! Everyone says he's a leader in the changing room, he's the only one in the team to have won the things we want<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LeWookieGooner i'd say don't jinx it but. It's inevitable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I SAID TO TAKE THEO OFF OVER CAMPBELL AND ALL YOU CUNTS, AND HENRY WERE FINE WITH IT. FUCK OFF PLEASE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Orangeiceman10 at least someone is having a good time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasAFC @Addyylaide but he's not doing anything with his pace<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Should have taken Theo off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Elneny and Alexis please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Keeping the faith. Angry. But I still think we can get something. #COYG. Don't disappoint me. @Arsenal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__arsenalnews_ I'd rather keep Campbell over Theo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDjole even with 10 men I think we're on par with Chelsea. They're not really as prolific as they could be. Think we can get a goal or 2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeWookieGooner hopefully 2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDjole I need to find a new hobby.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FlaminiPunch Stupid thing to say<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm going to go and hide now<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Addyylaide @Arsenal you're the only account I've read not complaining about this 👍🏼🙌🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yaanuzaj true. Theo's form recently is concerning. Though could be a protest against not playing CF. United game was magic. Need a repeat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yaanuzaj Theo over Giroud?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This. All of this.  https://t.co/mA4cVptEAM<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GoonerGirl1969 protesting not playing CF.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's no manager classier than Arsène Wenger. Man is fantastic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheFalseNein is he deliberately playing shit out wide so Wenger puts him back at CF? Cannot understand it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DareToMesut think we could do all 15 to be honest. Assuming these clubs don't turn into Barcelona, before we face Barcelona.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eolaoire @LiamGeorge_ I don't know. Based on us being Arsenal, they'll turn into Chelsea of 2014/15. But here's hoping!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eolaoire @LiamGeorge_ true but our squad should be good enough to not base success on those two. We need to be better<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm hoping these two games will persuade Wenger to ACTUALLY go and buy some better options. Too many chances missed recently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billypurdy10 I'd personally take to breaking the legs of all their vile fans, and booing them constantly, but that's just me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shayne_afc no, apparently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FA if not then you're just as vile as their fans.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RedAndWhite11 lower most likely.  championship-low<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__arsenalnews_ we do that with Giroud. vL'pool everyone slagging him off after he missed the easiest goal, 10mins later it's all "nanana"<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bellerined not theo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeWookieGooner depends on if we show up against Stoke. Which if we play like this and bottle it once again… I just can't even.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We cannot, cannot, cannot, cannot, cannot lose or draw against Stoke. WE CANNOT. Or Leicester will go top. They have Villa.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We need to stop taking off our attacking players when only leading by one goal. FFS. And what the fuck were you doing all game @theowalcott<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dzennon awesome 😊  That'll cost you a steak topped with cheese. 😏  Or a smooch 😘😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dzennon basically what I'm trying to say is that I'm hungry.  Bring me food.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dzennon no wait, isn't aged steak a thing? You're like a fillet, marinating in juices for a few weeks, coming out tastier on the other side<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dzennon also, you're getting better with age. I'd say "like wine" but I'm more of a cheese man. You're like a nice lump of Stilton.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dzennon me right now  https://t.co/ErZqEb8WZG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MesutOzil1088 is king of banter 😉 @Carra23   https://t.co/HSYVvzdhLT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eolaoire if they go with Alexis it works for both boys and girls.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OziLogic so does your use of English seemingly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OziLogic I don't get to decide TOTY either.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OziLogic this season being part of 2015 and all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OziLogic was more of why would de Gea be there given he's been on par with the others this season. And again, Courtois should be there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OziLogic you clearly weren't watching all his games<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OziLogic and since then has been meh. Real were seemingly lucky to miss out. What about Courtois? Helped Chelsea win the damn league<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OziLogic why on earth would De Gea be there? He's been mostly average this season. Cech, Lloris, Courtois, Butland. All warrant a mention<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OziLogic Cech??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HuffPostUK @JoeDifford I'm sure it wouldn't be too difficult to find some cheap, insightful writers if you just ask people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HuffPostUK @JoeDifford HP has gone down over the past few years. I didn't realise how bad it was getting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HuffPostUK @JoeDifford also, Spurs have been solid but haven't been consistent at winning. That's why they're below Arsenal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HuffPostUK @JoeDifford whether it's Leicester, City, Spurs or Arsenal, that side will be a title winning one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HuffPostUK @JoeDifford as words aren't your forte let me put it like this:  Winning title + football team = title winning football team<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HuffPostUK @JoeDifford whoever wins the title IS, by act of winning the title, a title winning side.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HuffPostUK @JoeDifford the league is also stronger now due to increased revenue making it harder to be a regular "top four" club<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HuffPostUK @JoeDifford the fact some teams fell away means they are not good enough to compete with those higher up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HuffPostUK @JoeDifford you can point at me being an Arsenal fan but that doesn't hide the lazy writing for the sake of some comments<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HuffPostUK you must be out of your mind publishing @JoeDifford. He clearly has no idea how football works, nor how to write.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Fucking stressful this team. Love either way! One Nil to the Arsenal!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bournemouth, Watford and Arsenal wins please<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THANK FUCK FOR THAT. Screw everyone who thinks Kos isn't one of the best players in the league<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>This.  https://t.co/2QzYs5CC6D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoveringKosc I was rooting for Per-Gabriel. Should let Kos rest and save for bigger teams. Do not need an injury there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BLarsenAFC1886 rest Koscielny. Don't need him injuring himself when big games are coming up. Gabriel/Per works well for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dzennon you liking this means you agree to bringing me food. I'll be waiting…  https://t.co/uUaNuspCsR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dzennon if you share it with me I too would think you're amazing. The most amazingist, even.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy New Year Momma. ❤️🌷<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it's fair to say #TheArsenal was the best part of 2015. Really wasn't much else good (he says, hoping/knowing he forgot something…)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No clue why I never watched #Miranda before. It's brilliant. @mermhart is epic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMikeOD was it your subconscious telling you to head back to Melbourne?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@everydayalexis A: LCFC, CPFC // H: MCFC, THFC, MUFC. We normally draw at home at best to "big teams". We have a chance to win them all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need this article framed!  https://t.co/lIQSSsz2Av<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well. Watching #BigHero6 and #ForrestGump has completely messed with my emotions this evening. Good job, Hari. Good job.  Utter. Knob.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VintageVieira Leicester over City is best in a win, but the sooner they start dropping points the better. Can't trust anything this season<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VintageVieira draw is the best result. But it'll end with a late City goal I bet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoonerGordo Arsenal are the only top club to beat them. Liverpool are tenth. Not sure where your info on this is from. "Easily beaten"??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vardybum Cech.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gabriel! I have never understood why we don't play him more!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joe_363_ how long have you been traveling?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaptainMatt28 you wear a hangover well 👍🏼<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeWookieGooner our record against other 8 in top 9 is W6,D2,L0 That doesn't happen very often. We should be positive. We're allowed a blip.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tmchmbrs after me. Me first. Because &lt;genuine reason here&gt;<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When did the "favourite" star thing on Twitter become a heart??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottyDougs2 @ArsenalFC1104 @kidcullity it was. And was offside due to the build up play. But it's good we can help a team out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottyDougs2 @Arsenal ...despite goals 1,2&amp;3 should have been disallowed because of ref cock-ups??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArsenalFC1104 @ScottyDougs2 hahahahahaha, Scotty you're mad jokes right now. 😂😂😂 you lost to Norwich at OT, as well as Bournemouth &amp; Stoke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__arsenalnews_ plus, our record against the other 8 of the top 9 teams:  W6, D2, L0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear #Arsenal fans, our record against the other top 9 teams: W: 6, D: 2, L: 0  Calm your tits, yeah? We were shit. But it's not over! #COYG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dzennon How to get away with murder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Had to lose a game. It's law of averages. Might as well be against a team struggling for mid table. Give 'em a chance y'know<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DashThree wish I was one!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeWookieGooner who?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Spurs given credit for unbeaten run. Fair enough. But if Arsenal/City/Utd/LFC/CFC went unbeaten with mostly draws they'd get slaughtered<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MrAntony 1) stop being single, 2) travel everywhere in the world, 3) buy a house… all realistic despite no dating life, no money &amp; no money<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You know it's not your night when you're heading to meet a mate &amp; instead end up at the office wondering why you forgot your security pass…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrAntony legit just shat myself at this. #jumpiestpersonalive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrAntony first thing should  be to not lose the list!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrAntony four years huh. Only a little envious. Would probably take me a year to even come up with a list<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrAntony haha I'll try and do something I guess. What's on yours?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrAntony yes. The list consists of me compiling said list though… turning 28 in February. Should get my ass moving.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's raining and I'm in shorts. Hari's in his element 👌🏼😁<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Political leaders &amp; campaigners in other nations don't try to score cheap political points on another nation's tragedy. @realDonaldTrump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ONLY IN AMERICA do DICK HEADS like @realDonaldTrump discuss things like Gun Control laws in this context.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The US has no national gun control laws and people still get attacked. WHAT WOULD GUNS HAVE DONE TO STOP THE #PARISSHOOTING ANYWAY?!?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ONLY IN AMERICA would DICK HEADS correlate French gun control laws with the attack in #Paris. 118 people died you disgusting cretins.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>US news reporting of the Paris attacks is disgraceful. Less on what's going on, more "how it affects us?"  And fuck the rest of the world?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Return to hometown for brother's engagement party to remember just how awful small town public transport is. A three hour wait for a taxi…!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eolaoire *6-0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryOfN5 we had to lose a player before they scored each goal. Easy to beat 9 men<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dzennon Perverted Scrounger 😳😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TLRailUK what is up with your trains this week? Every one I've been on has been delayed, from 5 mins to 1 hour. Fix it for goodness sake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TreeAtTheBack ah. Well. I feel stupid. Don't think I ever noticed that. Cheers mate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TreeAtTheBack you set up a poll. How? Didn't know you could do that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TreeAtTheBack how the hell did you get a poll going on here?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toddlerlex *buggered<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toddlerlex also, the fact you budgeted off to nyc without me breaks my heart a little.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toddlerlex why, I don't know what you mean, Mr. Lex… :b<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toddlerlex lol it's OK. I'd have hated to see you say "ah Hari. You're completely right. I shall defer to you politically here on out"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toddlerlex haha I totally just planned an argument in my head and you'd have to let me rant for around 50 tweets before I could finish 😁<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toddlerlex I can honestly say, hand to heart, you would do a much better job and I'm pretty sure there's a lot we don't agree on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toddlerlex you know they won't. And the fact is none of the current parties are what this country needs. All major ones are sell outs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toddlerlex if they organised this many people to vote they could probably save a lot of people some hassle.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Joe_363_ God damn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"I literally felt 6'7"  So you literally felt metaphorical?  People need to be taught what "literally" means and when to use it. Fools.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joe_363_ you have to do a profile thing so the person can reject you but I got a great place in nyc having never used it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eolaoire @LiamGeorge_ used to agree with that. But I found women tended to be more manipulative. I appreciate the directness from men.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Well @Adele.  You can make great music but you clearly can't make a decent cuppa. Teabag THEN water!! What would Maggie Smith say?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After watching some of yesterday's #ClintonHearing, fair to say Congressional #Republicans &amp; their followers ONCE AGAIN prove to be idiotic.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dzennon I think I prefer hers on that but I only like 3 of her songs on 1989 but can listen to all of his. And that voice of his… #swoon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dzennon the song? The record?Adams' version? Swift's album generally? The year 1989? My tweet? Or life as a whole? #ImHilarious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryStewart07 my favorite Tweet right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you haven't listened to Ryan Adams be a better Taylor Swift than T-Swift, you're missing out. Bad Blood is actually a good song by him!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gary Neville continues to be one of my favorite analysts of the game. Are you listening #Arsenal?  @GNev2  http://t.co/oFTN2njQqZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toddlerlex glad to hear!! How's the event? (I'm assuming you're there…?)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I have no words. I hate football.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just meh.  Not surprised and too tired to care anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WHY IS THIS DAY SO SHIT WHY KOS WHY?! -__- I need a drink.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TLRailUK @sammyzblair that's not an answer. Why the fudge did you cancel a train which is moving perfectly fine???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ryan Adams as Taylor Swift &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Taylor Swift as Taylor Swift<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well. Called it. #ENGvWAL Good game though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanHealy they'd have to figure the London transport system first<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joe_363_ there's a "news" app now. For some reason…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeProfAido @Memz_Dogi they could only do it once we were down to 10 and we finished their job with an own goal. Us &amp; ref beat ourselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>After defeating a 9-man Arsenal team with an own goal I thought Chelsea had sorted themselves out. Oh wait… #NUFCvCFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hahahahahahahaha Hahahahahahahaha Hahahahahahahaha Hahahahahahahaha 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 #Chelsea<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>J'adore Alexis! ❤️❤️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Sjbveyron but… I'd only want good people, surely?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am loving all the idiot Chelsea fans who think this is unjustified. Says a lot about the way they play football.  https://t.co/o86DoXCY3e<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Sjbveyron October 12. Your evening is busy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I cannot begin to explain how excited I am for #Suffragette<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Feed is filled with stuff about David Cameron and pigs… Do people have nothing better to talk about than scandalous gossip? Fuck off please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ladies, if you don't have time to do your make up in the morning then get up earlier. Don't do it on the train. Make up all over the place!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeProfAido not enough. Should be banned for life for all the incidents he's committed and gotten away with.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't understand girls who draw on their eyebrows. They look like bad clowns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The farce of the officials: how Mike Dean won the match for Chelsea  http://t.co/yrhWtLegwQ  http://t.co/EhK6tOLr1C<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeProfAido Neymar or Suarez for me. Though I like the idea of Benzema as he played with Özil before.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeProfAido if you could pick any striker to play with him who would you choose?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just saw Wenger's comments after the game and he's spot on. Doesn't dispute Gabriel but Costa is a disgrace to the game &amp; should be banned<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes Cazorla should have tried to chill Gabriel but the referee is running the show and he did nothing. Fuck off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chelsea commit more fouls than Arsenal yet… we get two sendings off &amp; they get a couple yellows. I'm sorry @FA but you need to do something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At some point the @FA have to take responsibility for this.   https://t.co/HDbRybeMW8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>MOTM- Mike Dean. He won the match for Chelsea. Couldn't be done without him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Own goal. Can't even make it 2 against 9 men by themselves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a disgrace. Mourinho doesn't know how to play football. He can win games but he can't organise an actual football match.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He let Costa loose. Spent too much time talking about him in the lead up and then to have Costa be a vile cunt of a player in the next game?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm happy with how we played. Only 1-0 down? Yeah. Chelsea are amazing only beating us by a single goal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't care what anyone says. Down to nine men &amp; I still love my classy team. Referees are a joke &amp; Chelsea know how to cheat &amp; play victim<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeProfAido and can only win against 10 men after cheating their way though it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love our away fans though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Acts like a petulant baby  I love @rioferdy5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And @FA will not do a thing to sort this kind of BS out.   https://t.co/AP1YKzE9FC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And no one can say a thing to Arsenal fans. Not disputing Gabriel's sending off, just wondering why the fuck Costa is allowed to be a cunt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't care if it's a shitty thing to say, I hope Diego Costa suffers a horrendous leg shattering injury ending his career. Filthy player.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even Michael Owen is on arsenal's side<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a fucking joke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ebrahimsanje because he can't score any other goal regularly. But he's the best player in the league and "better than Ronaldo"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Michael Owen only speaks when he wants to big up Chelsea and bad mouth Arsenal. Listen to when we dominate &amp; play well. Forgot he was there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And of fucking course. Michael fucking Owen.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Was feeling decent this morning until I remembered the score last night. And now I want to destroy something. Perhaps this train…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That moment when you realise you've stupidly chosen a tan-shirt-&amp;-trousers outfit which is made worse by your tan coloured smoothie. 😕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiamGeorge_ he's a poor Aaron Ramsey, who is a rich David Beckham<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How is this vomit rainbow thing working on snapchat by the way..?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because apparently a banana or an apple just isn't cutting it.  Though more than 4 hours sleep would probably help…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don't understand how these guys do it. I've barely any energy to gym in AM &amp; they're here training like mad. Maybe I need pre-workout shiz.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why why why can't City perform in the #UCL? I mean, it's funny. But I feel bad for them. Hate them the least of Utd &amp; Chelsea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Luke Shaw broke his leg?? Yikes 😕 . Hope not too serious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing quite like doing a 12 hour shift accidentally and the long days aren't actually supposed to have started yet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I didn't buy music to see it shunned by Apple's recommendations and streaming options. Why take a good thing and ruin it. Idiots.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@eolaoire I'm all about Rambo. In every way imaginable. #sorrynotsorry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eolaoire we lose with him as CF or generally speaking? to be honest I've never loved Walcott. He's decent but wouldn't cry if we sold him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DezzaW6 @eolaoire now that I've made the joke they'll finish 4th and we'll be 6th<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DezzaW6 @eolaoire what? But they have Harry Kane and are therefore set for top four!  😂😂😂😂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eolaoire why not Walcott-Sanchez-Ox? Sanchez played up front when Giroud was injured and he scored a lot of goals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eolaoire @DezzaW6 people just need to calm the fuck down. I was pissed at no new outfield additions but I grew up. #COYG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eolaoire @DezzaW6 Man is right though. X number of big players available. Who would you pick? Real Madrid or Arsenal if you're him??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eolaoire @DezzaW6 we'll have to get Per on the case. Can't have that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eolaoire @DezzaW6 there are definitely issues that need discussing but I'm never ever #WengerOut or BS like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eolaoire @DezzaW6 haha that's amazing. 😂😂  Do you feel less safe now? #security<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eolaoire @DezzaW6 haha how tall are you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DezzaW6 @eolaoire I'm judging you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eolaoire @DezzaW6 wouldn't be surprised if there's another train incident… 😒😒<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eolaoire @DezzaW6 Rambo, Bellerin, Alexis, Ox, Emi Martinez 👌🏼😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eolaoire @DezzaW6 I love Giroud. I'm saying it's embarrassing we only have one actual Arsenal goal l<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eolaoire I meant @Arsenal are embarrassing. Giroud's goal was good. Just be nice if he had actual competition to win Goal of the Month<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well this is embarrassing.   https://t.co/qLwIa7rZRx<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ManUtd_NewsHQ but we still have one of the best squads who have been together a long while and are a talented bunch. Just missing something<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ManUtd_NewsHQ I'm happy with the team. Pissed we haven't reinforced though given our injury record and lack of top-top-top CF/CM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ManUtd_NewsHQ spend £36m on Martial but won't spend a few bob more than 25m on Pedro? Insanity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ManUtd_NewsHQ thanks for this! Definitely made my day! 😂😂😂  https://t.co/bTUzMF8LQa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedAndWhite11 this is my team! Though I'd interchange between Welbz &amp; Giroud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JessWilshere tempted to unfollow right now…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Phil_Lloyd many nights at uni spent with @sarahbeeny. Totally platonic of course.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone begging on Arsène Wenger to leave needs to seriously calm the fuck down. I'm annoyed but he knows better than all of us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MiaSanArsenal Wilshere over Ox?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jste90 I do that. But just this one guy in my mirror always bothering me with his poor dress sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChamboOfSecrets Favourite to all of this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Legendhenry I forgot all about that. As if I wasn't annoyed enough... Guess our money needs to go somewhere...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChamboOfSecrets Giroud will break his leg against Stoke and we'll have a wasteful Walcott up front.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll never be #WengerOut though. Just #LightAFireUnderWengersAss<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love that we have @PetrCech but he will only save us a few points, not 10-15 if we cannot score any goals, like against @LFC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's embarrassing we're a top club and have spent only £10m. We can only justify that with a solid squad. And we don't have that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We needed a central midfielder, we let them all slide by. We need another goal scoring option other than Giroud. We didn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We shouldn't buy for the sake of buying. That would be us becoming #LFC, #COYS &amp; current #MUFC. We haven't strengthened outfield tho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's face it. Wenger is looking for a new @ThierryHenry. He's not going to find one. That was your one in a million.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChamboOfSecrets 7 mins to save your manhood.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mattie_W_87 Love Giroud but Walcott is not a back up and Welbeck needs time to get back. I'd favour an OX-ALEXIS-WALCOTT front three.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mattie_W_87 @Arsenal Charlie Austin would be the wrong player for our style but I rate him &amp; he can hit the net. @chazaustin9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mattie_W_87 @Arsenal If we could score goals I'd be happy. And yet...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Remind me how much money we have in the bank again? #Arsenal @Arsenal #DeadlineDay  £10m and ONLY ONE SIGNING. Ready for all the injuries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mattie_W_87 @Arsenal Because we're suckers. Embarrassment. Not even extra squad players for the inevitable injuries. £10m is pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mattie_W_87 Same. I'm still pathetically hoping something will happen. Why do @Arsenal hate their fans so...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Arsenal Feel free to hire me to do your transfer business. I promise to do just as much work as your current staff at a 1/5 of the price.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE MODERATOR?!?! TWEET WHEN YOU SIGN SOMEBODY OTHERWISE SHUT THE FUDGE UP. NONCE. #DeadlineDay   https://t.co/NTJXYaoOwe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Arsenal fans: it could be worse. We could be @skysportspaulg, standing outside #COYS all day. #SkyDeadlineDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dzennon what even is that? And I just spent way too long watching… #hypnotic. Is that how you get boys in the clubs?!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jumpytiny cheers for the win earlier by the way 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThierryFinesse "should". Every Gooners favourite word.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jumpytiny just keep me Rambo, Bellerin and Sanchez? They're too pretty to go down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jumpytiny excited for tomorrow??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiamGeorge_ I feel this is a recurring plot line...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@owenlmeredith what else is new. But they're just "serving the working man"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or Debuchy in CB  https://t.co/4pAYxQjmLf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So at this rate @PetrCech will race out and score the winner for us as well as goalkeeping and defending. WAKE UP YOU FOOLS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Keep forgetting this is a home game. Getting dominated.  Thank god for Petr Cech<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gunnerblog *Koscielny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeProfAido surprisingly nervy? I'd say expected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why aren't we playing Debuchy in central? Chambers will be great one day but this is a big match. Strength needed against Benteke.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jumpytiny haha true. I just wanted to see what you'd say. Giroud isn't my type.  Rambo on the other hand… 😍. And Ox 😉<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jumpytiny I'd take him over Giroud. Not in the Arsenal team though…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jumpytiny he can tear me apart anytime…  No wait. You meant the other thing.  Tbh it's not like he ever did before. He's good. Not great.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kobijv 😉 so bad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kobijv I still blame you. You should be punished<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kobijv haha. I blame you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kobijv a moment alone I think is needed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VintageOzil @HectorBellerin I'm too jealous for words right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kobijv I'd be the uniform. #closehold 😉<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kobijv that can't be real…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh COME ON and score at least one more West Brom. Do it for the League!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joe_363_ I know you have a boyfriend and this is all kinds of weird but I care not.  You're too hot for words.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lee_parnell great idea I think. Medieval punishment or no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LiamGeorge_ @eolaoire True but it's worth it just to see Mourinho's face.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alec1271 @6oscielny ...if she's paid well enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@__arsenalnews_ And all the Spurs fans are like "but what about Kane?"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Costa going down is the most pathetic thing I've seen in weeks! Apparently there's a poor acting school at Chelsea.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Alexis Sánchez chant is god-awful! But I LOVE THE MAN. 1-2 #CPFCvAFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeThompson_ @CaptainKaneway Agreed. The movies get better but the books went very down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaptainKaneway @JoeThompson_ TBH I struggled to read the first Twilight book. Had to for a class and wanted to shoot myself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaptainKaneway @JoeThompson_ Oh. Wait. You meant the books? I was talking about the films. Ha. I should learn to read...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love Giroud. We do need a more "clinical" CF, someone for the big matches. But that beautiful french man is brilliant.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WelBeast Or he'll take credit. "Arsenal won because they got a Chelsea player" and "You're welcome Arsene". What a cock.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sports journalists are really struggling with the whole writing part of their job description.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People really need to learn what "adamant" means. "Benitez was adamant" that Benzema won't leave, yet the manager said "I THINK he'll stay".<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jumpytiny like he'll last 50 years. Maybe he'll encourage you lot to focus on League/FA cups?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jumpytiny and who will buy you? You're unsellable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jumpytiny "death by fat Mike" sounds like a horrific way out. You know he won't go until he gets money back though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jumpytiny good old days.  I miss the late 90s/early 00s with the whole Arsenal v United rivalry. Those were great years.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ManUtd_NewsHQ ah well. Depends on price. RM won't over pay given there's one year but Benitez won't wait more than a year for him. He'll…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ManzuuT @SkyFootball @ChelseaFC he forgets before, LFC, then Utd &amp; AFC dominated the league on skill alone. CFC always be a money club.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ManUtd_NewsHQ I think if he was off he'd be off already. Though how much longer is his contract?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ManUtd_NewsHQ you don't think Utd will finish above City? Sterling won't fix their aging squad. They rely on injury-prone Agüero too much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrutalArsenal I'm hoping not. Waiting for him to say Utd CFC Liverpool City Southampton Spurs Swansea ... Arsenal<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Well hey. Never thought I'd be so happy to see my blood sugar low. 3.4mmol. Of course now I have to force feed myself… 😕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, the fever is back. Party time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WonderWilsh Bruce Springsteen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Concerned I can't keep my blood sugars stable. In the last 40 hours I've eaten 1/3 bagel. Yet I'm high no matter how much insulin I take.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well I guess I'm not quite done with puking. Whoop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I need to eat. Not sure my stomach can tolerate it. No Bueno. #SickDay<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Hotdesigner I'm not "for" fox hunting but I resent that it's a sport. If farmers hired professionals to do it quietly then to me, fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hotdesigner it's not at all but too many are pests. Grew up round farm land, knew farmers, they'd kill a coup of chickens and eat none.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hotdesigner not saying it's a good thing but the dogs, for the most part, are taught to go for the neck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hotdesigner to be honest it's worse when a farmer has to shoot it down, leaving it to die slowly and in pain if he doesn't aim correctly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DylanWalsh_10 they'll challenge but won't win. Arsenal Chelsea and United top 3. City fourth. Big overhaul needed in an ageing squad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DezzaW6 brilliant  https://t.co/3tCwRsXlOp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Question for the #GoonerFamily: would you rather have #Pedro or #Benzema at @Arsenal?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DezzaW6 ...you're not allowed to be a "buddy" or any other niche like anybody else. If it I rritates me I can't fathom how you must feel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DezzaW6 know it's not the same but I noticed this on nextdoorstudios (yes I went there!) black guys have to have a separate site: "Ebony"…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We picture Di Maria but don't include him on tour. #fail  https://t.co/Uej1BL6SiC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...None of these "WC" tools can hold a candle to Messi, Ronaldo, Suarez, or players past like Henry &amp; Zidane. #YouAreNotWorldClass  Regards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>… RVP had two great seasons, that's it. Sterling had one. And Kane? Good grief. WC means consistently excellent despite extraneous factors…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear Universe Define "world class" in footballing terms please. The word is thrown around so much it's lost all meaning. Sterling, RVP etc…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man City are fools. Sterling had ONE good season because he played with Suarez. £49m? Guy's a waste. Hope he crumbles like RVP.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@packsandbunks loved Arrow at first. But the characters are just too over dramatically serious. I mean calm the F down!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@packsandbunks no. I need to. Everyone says it's great. I'm just not a massive fan of the lead actor. Really need to see Agent Carter though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@packsandbunks to me Captain America 2 is the best Marvel movie to date.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@packsandbunks I'm still pretty shocked with how good it looks. Though I thought the same with GotG and didn't like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@packsandbunks oh I'd say watch it for sure. Just don't make a fuss with the cinema. I left wanting more. Still not sure what was missing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HaridosMac And don't even get me started on Harry Kane at £45m…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HaridosMac and their shitty players. Sterling's worth £20m at best. He's not even done anything. His one good season was because of Suarez<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HaridosMac how was Luke Shaw valued at £27m but Wilshere is only 30 and Ox is barely 20? These other clubs need to get over themselves<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HaridosMac not to mention Mourinho wanting Ox for Cech. Yup. Because Ox is only worth £14m…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HaridosMac Mate if Sterling's worth £40m Jack is at least £55m. Complete bullshit sums. As if Sterling is worth that much<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Gotta stop comparing this to the #FACupFinal. Sunderland only need to draw &amp; went in to park the bus. Villa won't have the luxury of a draw.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally   Some good news.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joe_363_ happy 21st birthday!  (You wish!)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FCArsenal4Life like him a lot but agree he's too inconsistent. Mostly a squad player for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We seem to forget that Southampton *could* (however unlikely) beat City. If we don't lose any of our three… 2nd. #HopefulGooner<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WelBeast It was solely Ospina's error but I still rate him higher than most others. He's been great for us. This shouldn't erase that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DailyCannon Ospina &gt; Fabianski &gt; Szczesny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is @SkySportsNewsHQ just an advert for their website and what we can find on there?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Joe_363_ what's the job?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joe_363_ given I only "know" you on Twitter, I'm 99% sure you've posted a similar tweet before Unless I'm wrong in which case… I'd be wrong<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MartinDaubney @AaronFekaris @Body_in_Mind @DiageoLiam will read later. Thanms<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AaronFekaris @Body_in_Mind @DiageoLiam @MartinDaubney Same applies when we're adults for goodness sake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AaronFekaris @Body_in_Mind @DiageoLiam @MartinDaubney was told as a kid to ignore people who annoy me. Guess what, it worked.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AaronFekaris @Body_in_Mind @DiageoLiam @MartinDaubney people need to grow up and stop taking everything so personally/offensively.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AaronFekaris @Body_in_Mind @DiageoLiam @MartinDaubney ...then don't buy it. You lend that company more publicity by ranting.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AaronFekaris @Body_in_Mind @DiageoLiam @MartinDaubney is it bad? Yes. Is it the end of the world? No. Too many awful things in this world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AaronFekaris @Body_in_Mind @DiageoLiam @MartinDaubney to be honest everyone needs to learn to chill &amp; ignore things that offend them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rociwi no. If Utd beat us we they go 1pt ahead. Assuming we win the rest of our games &amp; they theres we have game in hand. We won't get 2nd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're not getting second. City need to lose. Won't happen now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck you Arsenal. Wanted something to make this day better and once again you cocked it. Fucking waste. Cunts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Question: Why the fuck did we let Fabianski go over Szczesny??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DiageoLiam #DoubleStandards wasn't aimed at you specifically. Both have made rounds on Twitter yet only one mentioned as bad is the girl<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jonwillchambers Ed made such a highlight of her in his speech, though, it'd be surprising if she did resign.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoonerBBK we've adopted the American way it seems. Dems win, Reps attack. And vice versa. We're just the same now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonwillchambers she shouldn't be interim?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@attwood10 @theEpicGooner What did he say?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ridiculous amount of exaggeration at the moment. The NHS will not die &amp; anyone who thinks so simply hasn't understood politics. #GE2015<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JosephWilde @toddlerlex except under 13 years of Labour uni fees were still present, NHS got weaker and house prices were not cheap at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanDunt There is beer, chocolate, burgers and cake. I'd call that a win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Absolution_90 They're a wee bit hypnotic...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Somhairle That sounds painful...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly 30,000 in Kilmarnock? That's a bigger news story alone!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>To all those saying "Tories have failed to win a majority once again", you do realise that "once again" nor have any other party?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ladies &amp; gents, we have entered the worst part of politics. Hours of nothing to discuss so let's fill the void with speculation &amp; nonsense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm still rooting for a @Queen_UK landslide combined with beheadings for these nonce politicians. #OffWithTheirHeads #GE2015 #UKvotes2015<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Not sure who to vote for. I would vote #Conservative but I live in a veeeery Lefty area. Would be a waste... #Greens ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OneLilChilean @GoonerStat yeah but Campbell wanted to be a regular first team at Arsenal. He'll want out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GoonerStat @OneLilChilean Not Carvalho? Heard there could be a swap between him and Campbell as Sporting are interested.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Genuinely, anyone who believes the NHS is better under #Labour seriously has no clue what they're talking about. #Conservative<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well. So much for my baby face…  https://t.co/5kXkhUB4eh<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aslummentality @AliShakarji_ @GoonerGordo I'd take Özil. He does have poor games, but he doesn't just drop off at the end of the season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Maestrodevil79 @Arsenal As were you. You're just lucky Daddy Warbucks came to help you out. #AnnieFC #CFC #ChelseaFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aslummentality @AliShakarji_ @GoonerGordo I agree, but he mentioned earlier how Cesc played behind him. He was with Cesc, never Özil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliShakarji_ @GoonerGordo He's surely friends with Cesc though. I doubt he'd say anything bad about him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boils down to this: If playing like #Chelsea wins the League then I'm fine coming 2nd/3rd. Rather do well &amp; lose than be them #AFC @Arsenal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChelseaFC @jameswharton 10 years *is* boring. You're right. Remind us, what does 50 years feel like? We wouldn't know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arsenaloFka That's what I thought you meant. Well said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is #AFCvCFC treated as a loss for us and a win for them? We don't think we'll win the league. We technically made it harder for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who was MOTM? #AFCvCFC  Think I missed it...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Orangeiceman10 I think based on the game we do minus a really really impressive forward. *Love* Giroud but he's not, to me, good enough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theEpicGooner I hate him for it but can't say much on it if we didn't want him. Dick for leaving in the first place too but that's football<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cahill named in #TOTY but not @6_LKOSCIELNY?? And only one #SouthamptonFC player, despite having "the meanest defence in the League"?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GoonerBBK @noIookpass true but surely the pressure will be on them more? Plus he'll likely slip up. Big games don't suit Gerrard anymore.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toddlerlex I can see that trend. I just think it's rude, not sexist. By no means polite. No doubt many won't agree. Anyway hope you're well<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@toddlerlex don't get how it's specifically sexist though. I've had girls do that to me before. Just seems more rude than anything else.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dannmwagi would love him to come out and just say "no excuses- we were just awful."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArsenalWizKid I already decided. If he refuses to buy anyone for defensive cover - average is better than none - then I'll be WOB.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_ArsenalCentral decent given his first full Arsenal game. And it's not been an easy one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArsenalWizKid 6-3-1?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>“@gazz1412: MOTM, me for watching this shite!” Best tweet of the night #BVBvAFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dannmwagi people saying he's been lacklustre tonight but he's had next to no support at all. Love him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thearsenalhorse why do people think he'll come &amp; just score on every attempt? No CF does that &amp; he's been benched most of his senior career<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InsideThierry10 never heard anyone say that. Pretty genius notion really. Though who isn't at this point?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corkgooner33 maybe Szczesny can play DM?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OliPriceBates @GeorginaxAfc Poldi's coming on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The yellow suits #BVB  Like a swarm of bees anytime we get close to the box.  Y'know. Those 3 times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Orangeiceman10 whoa whoa whoa!!! Hold up.   That's possible?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArsenalWizKid he's bringing on poldi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HaridosMac please...…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watch Poldi come on and score a hatrick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corkgooner33 what drives me mental is how Wenger doesn't answer to anyone. Not the fans or the press. I just want to know WHY THIS SYSTEM?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_ArsenalCentral  O F F<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_arsenal__news thanks to who? Campbell. Where is he now? Keeping the bench warm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Orangeiceman10 gets him off the pitch. We're basically playing with 10 men anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yanoozaj our best years were mostly 4-4-2. Why he doesn't think that's best I'll never know. 4-2-3-1 is better than this BS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IamASYRAFK no. Arteta needs off. I'd still take Ramsey and Özil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corkgooner33 why is he taking Özil and Ramsey off and leaving fucking Arteta on?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yanoozaj oh I don't dispute that but this 4-1-4-1 system is bullshit. Especially with Arteta solely in DM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FOR FUCK'S SAKE WENGER CHANGE THE FUCKING SYSTEM, GET ARTETA OFF BEFORE HE HAS A HERNIA AND PUT ÖZIL INTO CAM AS HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yanoozaj doesn't help he's played out of position 😕<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My biggest criticism of #Wenger is his utter admiration of his players. He needs to make some changes. Arteta off. Özil into position.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CrazyGooner007 well that's just bullshit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BenVarelaAFC CAMPBELL. CAMPBELL. CAMPBELL.  I don't get the hoohah of keeping him if we don't play him. He's a breath of fresh air.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corkgooner33 I adore him but not against Rambo coming off either<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>CAN WE PUT CAMPBELL ON NOW PLEASE?!? 😑 WHY KEEP THE BEAUT TO WARM THE BENCH? #BVBvAFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corkgooner33 to be fair Arteta running after anyone is pretty embarrassing…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KrisGoonerMason same things were said in this game last year. And look how well that worked out! Arsenal fans are possibly the worst.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Current mismanagement has raised questions over Wenger’s defence  http://t.co/v3Ys6RgLAZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EE does the new step mean you'll put the extra funds to fixing the fucking network or will you continue screwing customers - &amp; now workers?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InsideThierry10 Not that I am saying I like Nasri. He will always be a complete shit head...albeit a great player, thanks to Wenger.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InsideThierry10 Nah Ashley Cole to me will always be worse. He was part of a winning team &amp; wanted more money. Nasri at least wanted glory.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InsideThierry10 I wouldn't boo him &amp; I don't deserve to be hanged. Different sit. to Nasri etc. AFC didn't want him or he'd be Red again.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SkySports @btsport At some point you'll focus on the fans and not on money making. Why can't the other show highlights &amp; in-depth analysis?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Lewis Hamilton? Or Theo Walcott? :p<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Orangeiceman10 It'll be +4 minimum on top.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>COME ON YOU MOTHER HUBBING GUNNERS!!!! #ALEXISSANCHEZ #COYG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'd prefer @CalumChambers95 on making mistakes as DM but at least try instead of Flamini fumbling around. Started good but can't sustain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TAKE. FLAMINI. OFF. Chambers DM &gt;&gt; Flamini And bring OX on! Or Campbell! And probably take Ramsey off... Not been great today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WILSHERE!!!!!!!! YOU BEAUTY!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corkgooner33 Flamini off, the way Wilshere's playing move him back, and put Ox on with Ozil CAM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CrazyGooner007 I'd rather take of Rambo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoannArsenal Take off Flamini, move Wilshere deep as he's been good everywhere but final third, put Ox on and have Ozil play CAM into O/W/S<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KieranCPhoto I didn't think he did get booked..?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I also cannot believe the pace on Alexis still. One minute he's in City's penalty box, then suddenly he's standing with Szczesny. #Champion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All these PL teams seem to always have @aaronramsey in their crosshairs. #YouCantTouchRambo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@YouGottaReus Southampton are my second team. Ideal top 4:  1 - Arsenal 2 - Southampton 3 - Swansea 4 - Man City.... I like how they play.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGottaReus Hope so! The douche.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGottaReus I'm so confused by what's a lie and what's not. Are both deals still on?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FACOACHL1 Wait is it done?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InsideThierry10 the most cringeworthy moment of the entire day. *face palm*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corkgooner33 :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I want to slap him round the face for leaving us without a DM &amp; no CB after #TV5. BUT. I still have faith in #Wenger to lead us. #Arsenal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGottaReus @YoannArsenal YES! But! SANOGO! ... ... ... ... ...yeah, I know... :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FACOACHL1 These stats for real? Suddenly I'm a wee bit chipper.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Guess this is the end of @Corkgooner33 then. Peace out!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CrazyGooner007 Stronger but not as good as I would have hoped. I'm happy with all these but this is supposed to be the start of a new era.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Orangeiceman10 "Hi, we're @Arsenal. Haven't we met?"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FACOACHL1 #Loan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGottaReus and @Arsenal's over here like....... "Hi"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGottaReus Part of me respects his belief in our players. Part of me wants to punch him in the face.  #Wenger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Orangeiceman10 crazy that Wenger wants Jan window closed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Be honest, unless we signed Messi, Ronaldo, James, Reus, Neymar etc @Arsenal fans will never be happy. If we signed Falcao it'd be "CB/DM?!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InsideThierry10 and by CB/DM what you mean is Källström.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great. Another season of this:  #Mourinho  http://t.co/jBiDhCzyKv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Orangeiceman10 Does he ever explain anything? It'll beat around the bush.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So.  @CalumChambers95 is our right back cover.  Our centre back cover...  And our defensive midfielder cover?  #WengerIsADouche<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thearsenalhorse And then it's Källström on loan?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FACOACHL1 lmao. #Dead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DTArsenal I'm assuming Sky are wanting to drag it out. TV again deciding how football runs. FFS.  AND FUCK I WANT A DM.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YoannArsenal Carvalho gone due to third party I hear. They complicate it and AFC didn't want to deal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CrazyGooner007 I admire their stance at not wanting money to completely run things, but we need to wise up. We don't get to decide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGottaReus Sounds like us. See: Viera. See: RVP.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CrazyGooner007 I'm still pissed. He could've covered at CB &amp; DM. Should've just paid whatever. But with 3rdparty I can't blame us for not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thearsenalhorse Don't they want to offload him anyway?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CrazyGooner007 Heard it was the third party owners? They wanted 40m, we bid 24. They reduce to 24, we bid 20ish. Shit storm over there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CrazyGooner007 @_arsenal__news it clearly isn't weaker though. I understand your Wenger frustration but that statement is hardly fair.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryStewart07 I know. It's a good way to be. No one expects anything from me that way!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGottaReus @wayneveysey I thought he was staying? Also, is not now *really* too late?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lazallana @DareToGooner #TWEETOFTHENIGHT Giggle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surely at this point there is no chance of a shock signing. Would've heard about us &amp; some other player by now.  DAMN IT I WANT CARVALHO :(<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryStewart07 is that your preferred fragrance? ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedArmy49 @GoonerNow I heard it was dead?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGottaReus Apparently we didn't want to meet the asking price. @Arsenal are the Jewish football club of the League #Cheap<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thearsenalhorse they won't sell him though will they<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CrazyGooner007 TBF I wouldn't pay that much for a one year loan. Other players will demand more or walk. BUT we should've done better /:<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGottaReus @Arsenal I may be dead by them. I thought 90mins of Arsenal playing was stressful. At least I'm prepped for the season now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGottaReus @Arsenal I read that was caput somewhere...? TOO MANY TWEETS. NOT ENOUGH EYES.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@_arsenal__news Was Khedira ever confirmed as being 12m? I thought that was just news. And didn't he say he wanted to stay at RM?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGottaReus @Arsenal I have a friend...? I don't who's left. Can't think of any CBs available other than untried ones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGottaReus @Arsenal I'd rather a DM to CB. Sounds crazy but the DM can at least cover there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SublimeSanchez I don't get it. They wanted 40m. We bid 24 cash. They reduce later to 24m. We bid 20. WHAT'S WRONG WITH US. Pay the fuck up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ColTalbot1 what a cunt.  But hilarious!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SublimeSanchez apparently he's said he's staying put. I don't know if it's true, but said he is happy with Sporting. #DeadInside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CrazyGooner007 I think he'll be good. Has a point to prove. Plus he's a better option than Sanogo &amp; maybe Giroud. WC he is not though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGottaReus AND WHAT A TROOPER HE WAS!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thearsenalhorse Genuinely lmao.  Oh... Delirious from disappointment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGottaReus Well we had no problem bringing in Källström without a medical.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGottaReus well that's exciting. But. I shall resign my optimism. #GoonerLife<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGottaReus was the Huntelaar rumour a non-starter?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FactsInYourFace @dzennon It's more than 6.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We gave them Van Persie.  We get Welbeck.  That seems fair...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How hilariously funny would it be if @FALCAO fails his medical at #MUFC. #banter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGottaReus well.... that came outta left field.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Arsenal have signed the fewest players in the Premier League. Four. The next is six. What is wrong with us?! #AFC #TDD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Orangeiceman10 Same. Hoping he'll surprise us all. Just annoyed that we weren't genuinely in for anyone else &amp; haven't paid up for Carvalho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGottaReus Is Carvalho still a thing? No one has said anything and that's the one I'm waiting on. CF, to me, is less important than DM rn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGottaReus well that's one positive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikesanz19 @YouGottaReus but he didn't do that for Giroud?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Orangeiceman10 probably but we're supposed to be a team competing for the best, not a team where we either don't try or plainly refuse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New fucking era my arsehole. Chelsea, City, feel free to take third and fourth places as well. #FuckWenger<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This. Is. Fucking. Disgraceful. Utd loan in one of the best CFs in the world &amp; we're taking one of their rejects. @Arsenal have no ambition.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thearsenalhorse Banter if he doesn't pass the medical.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGottaReus 1k what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Welbeck is a hope for us- this speaks volumes. The only thing more stressful than an Arsenal match is being a Gooner on #TransferDeadlineDay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGottaReus drink more pints than Sanogo fluffs shots on goal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GaryStewart07 #celibate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGottaReus I think we all need to take a break - things could look better after a beer or 12.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Props to #Wenger on having confidence in our squad when fans don't. Problem is, he wants to find another Henry #LightningNeverStrikesTwice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrevorSDempster I'd prefer Campbell of Podolski up front.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGottaReus I'd take AW playing 2 up front with current batch &amp; not 1. Sanogo can't play solo up there, Poldi/Campbell would need support.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaredjedwards Most do! But I've had some who were awful - and I mean AWFUL - and she stared at me when I didn't tip her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaredjedwards I should say, I am happy to tip but I hate waiters who make no effort to be a good server and then expect money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaredjedwards Definitely not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaredjedwards this calls for a change in the service industry. Why are customers paying for food and the staff? #EmployerResponsibility<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGottaReus Plus at £300k a week. Wouldn't be willing to pay that. Not just high, but it'd totally fuck the structure &amp; others could walk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@YouGottaReus True but if we weren't in for him it really shows our lack of drive. We need a CF. There's a CF. And we're over here chilling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ToobsMcDan Haha I was going to offer up vanilla! I'm more of a Relaxing Zen / Forest guy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TimHowardGK saved 15 goals...the most in any World Cup game since it began.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely gutted but anyone who says the US were not deserving then... Well you're morons. Belgium played... Actually. They played OK tbh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>YES!!!!!! ONE MORE!!!!!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"There might be another goal but it cannot be a Belgium one"  Thanks for that, Steve.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Put. Altidore. On.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>SHOTS: #BEL 22-5 #USA  (7-2 on target)  I mean, come on. Not sure what surprises me more, lack of attack by US or lack of goals by Belgium<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm not enjoying this half as much. 🙈<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rickyryder_ Haha I just wasn't paying attention! I finished whatever I was doing before the end and I realised just how amazing it was.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickyryder_ I just streamed it all online. The first episode...I honestly didn't go "whoa" until the final minutes. So stick with it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rickyryder_ YES. I was in the same position less than 2 months ago. Ended up watching 37 episodes in 3 days (#nolife) Better than expected!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@justinGMT But those countries also gain a crap load in tourism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justinGMT Olympics is different though as few countries would have the velodrome needed for cycling, and other specialist needs for sports<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justinGMT For instance, England could host any WC because we just need to improve existing stadiums. Nothing needs building.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justinGMT That's the fault of the governments though. I think the sporting bodies need to be realistic about who can take on the challenge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanDunt I think we should see what happens if we do. Could open up a lot of other options. We base the team on a striker who hasn't scored<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wally0726 haha I'll be rooting for my real home team regardless. #usasoccer<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corkgooner33 even in his position he doesn't do well. Roy needs to sit him out for one game, give others a chance &amp; see what happens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justinGMT Olympic stadium in London was used by the public after as are other parts, and now it's being renovated for a London league club<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wally0726 haha true. But no one expected Costa Rica to beat Uruguay. Soooooooo 😁 🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wally0726 I mean… yeah… maybe… maybe… … …<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rooney is overrated. I think we should focus on other players who can do more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wally0726 I'm excited for it! I mean. They could win the whole thing… maybe…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wally0726 haha OK. Just checking 😉 who were you rooting for?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wally0726 ...what was? I was talking about the game<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ayjzzle .............…<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't take Joe Hart seriously. He's just the head and shoulders guy to me, where his performance is based on how itchy his scalp is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was sodding close<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Corkgooner33 it'd be nice if we actually pretended like we have other important players. Like the other 10 on the pitch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is becoming painful..<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>You have to wonder where we'd be right now if @aaronramsey had never been injured. He's our key player &amp; we've been struggling without him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottyDougs2 True. I'd like one of those weird things to happen *for* us. But no... I don't care if Everton go 4th. Force us to BUY players<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why the hell wasn't OX on from the start? Ridiculous. I hope we go down. Maybe then we'll buy some fucking players rather than dipping in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottyDougs2 haha, mate... you think you'll beat Munich, Barcelona, Real Atletico, PSG or Chelsea?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JimboBohan disagree. With Christie going down the GOP's only real hope is Jed Bush. But most people don't want a 3rd Bush in power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimboBohan Congress in general has been a failure regardless of party. The most unsuccessful one ever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimboBohan even Boehner's getting sick of it. Plus the Latino vote is going to be the deciding factor and they're overwhelmingly Blue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimboBohan nah not the senate. The GOP are fucking themselves. They're splitting the party and the moderates have no place to go but left<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimboBohan but I don't dispute this point. He's been vastly unsuccessful. Too much expectation. Not enough action.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimboBohan in fairness he's had an horrifically hostile House &amp; Tea Party movement who are explicitly "anti Obama" regardless of policy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimboBohan you're also referring to events which she had no control over. Fairly certain she'd have acted the same<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimboBohan whoever's in charge will always be seen to be a fuck up. It's mostly the health care act that's ruined him. She can rectify it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimboBohan Clinton is "the most formidable presidential candidate this far from an election in US history"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimboBohan WE CANNOT BE FRIENDS Kerry is a fool. A fool!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BTCare there's usually one or two in range. Sometimes there's no signal but normally it's strong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BTCare Yes. In my house. It was working super fine last week. This time it's awful. Just can't afford to pay so much for poor service.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BTCare any idea why the FON service you provide and overcharge for is really really awful?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BTCare your site said it was easy to self install. I just want the standard broadband not the fibre. Too expensive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BTCare had to buy the FON one you offer as I have nothing else to use.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BTCare no. Trying to but I can't wait until April 3 for you to come and install it when you could probably send it for me to do myself.<|endoftext|>
