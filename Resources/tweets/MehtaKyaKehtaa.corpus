<|startoftext|>I had the great opportunity to interview my friend Major Kamlesh Mani @Invincible4158 for this story.  This generous act of his has set an example of love, generosity and compassion in the valley.  #Kashmir #IndianArmy @adgpi  https://t.co/1iSat56tRf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@isalilsand Usually the male is dominating. But in this case, female is. It's NORMAL.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealRaghv The problem is that you are paying attention to something which is not even a problem while ignoring the real issues.   https://t.co/KEHxpv0eto<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealRaghv No. It does not exist. It's a figment of your imagination.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@waglenikhil @JhaSanjay Will Sashi be any good for Hindi speaking states? We need an effective communicator as well.  Pilot has ditched Congress once, and Amarinder is too old to lead now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sardesairajdeep @IndiaToday Ah no. The double dose is 62% effective. One and a half dose is 90% effective.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alluring_scent @RT_com Um so a woman should earn lesser in order to respect her husband?  Free advice: Never marry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As expected, #OxfordVaccine shows 70% efficacy in trials. Amazing for India as it could be one of the first nations to get the dose.  Interestingly, it is 90% effective if given as half dose once, and full dose later and 62% effective when 2 full doses are given weeks apart.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So basically Bhakts have a problem when a Muslim marries a Hindu. But then they also have a problem when a Muslim marries a Muslim.  Let #SanaKhan live in peace no!   #LoveJihaad<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HitchhikerQ @ConradkBarwa @iamwasi_ @airuhairu I quote the tweet I responded to "They think its cool...not realising it makes them look like a fool.

<|startoftext|>@ishubhambhatia To say migration can go on for a day or two is extremely risky. It defeats the whole purpose of a lockdown. Why are we even stopping local transportation if we have to allow migration for a day or two?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ishubhambhatia We get to know about community transmission when we test more. (Example - S.Korea and now the US). What if even a single man's migration takes this disease to Bihar? It will be a disaster.  And what if this migration actually leads to community transmission in their states?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ishubhambhatia So I don't think Luce is being ignorant here. This is how COVID-19 destroyed Italy when people from the north migrated towards the south. This migration needs to stop. Now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ishubhambhatia There is no report of a migrant carrying the infection to rural areas becoz they haven't been tested. Not supporting the NRIs here, but these privileged people have the luxury of staying in isolation. Once a migrant takes this disease back home, he might infect a lot more people.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Here are the reasons why I believe today's #SupremeCourtVerdict was right 👇 . . . .  #AYODHYAVERDICT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Temple to be built at the disputed site. Muslims to get 5 acres for a mosque somewhere else in Ayodhya: Supreme Court.  #AYODHYAVERDICT #AyodhyaHearing #RamMandir #hindumuslimbhaibhai<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Even Muslim petitioners agree that the disputed site was worshipped by both Hindus and Muslims : Supreme Court.  #AYODHYAVERDICT #AyodhyaHearing #AyodhyaCase<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The judgement is unanimous.   #AYODHYAVERDICT #AyodhyaHearing #AyodhyaCase<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ASI couldn't tell if mosque was built after demolishing the temple: #SupremeCourt   #AYODHYAVERDICT #AyodhyaHearing #AyodhyaCase<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hindus consider #Ayodhya as Ram's birthplace: #SupremeCourtVerdict  #AYODHYAVERDICT #AyodhyaCase<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not clear who built the mosque: Supreme Court  #AYODHYAVERDICT #AyodhyaCase #hindumuslimbhaibhai<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ASI report says that temple existed.   #AYODHYAVERDICT #AyodhyaCase #hindumuslimbhaibhai<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Court rejects #NirmohiAkhara's and #SunniWaqfBoard's claim on the disputed site.   #AYODHYAVERDICT #RamMandir #hindumuslimbhaibhai #AyodhyaCase<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are EQUAL.  No matter what court says, government says or stupid politicians say. You, irrespective of your religion, are a loyal citizen of this country. And nothing can take away this from you.   #AYODHYAVERDICT #hindumuslimbhaibhai #AyodhyaCase<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@freebird2107 @VertigoWarrior Having said that, I will not reply further. We largely had a civil debate. We debated with facts, perceptions, and opinions. When we debate, we learn.  Good luck :)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@VertigoWarrior @freebird2107 Yes. When you questioned my integrity, you wanted to rattle me.  Just a small thing: You question who has the power, not one who is powerless.

<|startoftext|>@freebird2107 @VertigoWarrior Um um you are not a part of this conversation. So hussssshhh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VertigoWarrior @freebird2107 Meh. I can see where you are coming from and it's fine. You can rant on and on about my profession. This is your modus operandi and this is how you got people to block you first. I am not rattled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VertigoWarrior @freebird2107 Important work for the betterment of the nation? Oh my.  What you're doing is bootlicking. There's nothing wrong in following one ideology. It becomes problematic when you refuse to see the truth and continue cheerleading despite everything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VertigoWarrior @freebird2107 Amarnath Yatra had to be called off for the first time during the NDA government. Pakistani agencies could enter the Pathankot government during the NDA government. PM gate-crashed in Pakistan during the NDA government. Countries came close to war during the NDA government.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VertigoWarrior @freebird2107 What you're hiding is the fact that terrorist attacks actually increased during the NDA government. Cross border infiltration increased during the NDA government. One of the deadliest attacks on security forces happened during the NDA government..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VertigoWarrior @freebird2107 You can keep on posting one tiny screenshot of one long article to prove a point. I'm cool if it satisfies your ego.  You can see that TREND WAS DECLINING SINCE 2011-12 and nothing special happened during the NDA regime, you are still lying.<|endoftext|>

I know you wouldn't accept your mistake and I am so glad that you shared this piece as I knew if I had done it, you would have accused BBC of being anti-Indian<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VertigoWarrior @freebird2107 Maoist-related violence shows a declining trend since 2012, when UPA-2 in power. Alos, this article was written before the Pulwama attack that killed 40+ CRPF soldiers, so the government's argument of "NO MAJOR TERROR" attack falls flat.  Pulwama attack was deadliest in decades.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VertigoWarrior @freebird2107 No, Mr. Warrior. As I told you, I have a real job to do. I was busy. Now read the article carefully. I am appalled who clearly you can defend which is indefensible. Terrorism in Kashmir rose during the NDA-1 government, IT IS CLEARLY WRITTEN -1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VertigoWarrior And thanks for stepping in the trap. I knew you'd share this. If I had, you would have called BBC biased and fake. Why don't you read the article instead of cherry picking.  https://t.co/3Rd5IUp25r<|endoftext|>
