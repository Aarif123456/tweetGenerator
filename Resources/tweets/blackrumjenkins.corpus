<|startoftext|>@THEFREEDOMPRSS @JesseKellyDC @iamthejayc What is it that I'm wrong about here? That the body of evidence that exists suggests strongly that your leader is a bigot and a racist? That a movement can have Marxist/socialist elements without being specifically that?  Sorry bud, I doubt you know my "type" even remotely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@THEFREEDOMPRSS @JesseKellyDC @iamthejayc I'm not talking about giving benefit of the doubt, as I said, I'm sure there are Marxist elements to the movement she was referring to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@THEFREEDOMPRSS @JesseKellyDC @iamthejayc Context is always vital. That quote from Trump was not continous with the "fine people" bit...it came after he was pressed, not right after as you had said earlier. Sorry I didn't directly refute your bullshit at the time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@THEFREEDOMPRSS @JesseKellyDC @iamthejayc In the context-lacking 36 sec of video, she said, "We are trained Marxists", not "We are Marxists", she also didn't refer to the movement as a Marxist one, though I presume there would certainly be Marxist elements. I would also presume that there's a lot more to this interview.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@THEFREEDOMPRSS @JesseKellyDC @iamthejayc You realize, being of great intellectual girth and all, that it is possible to incorporate SOME ideas/concepts from one way of thinking, without actually buying into the entire belief system, yes?  Look at Canada. There are both capitalist and socialist ideologies in our system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@THEFREEDOMPRSS @JesseKellyDC @iamthejayc Marxist organization? Self-proclaimed topic mastery??   How's that deep end working out? ✌🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@THEFREEDOMPRSS @JesseKellyDC @iamthejayc Sorry dude, I've spent way too much time in my life making, and interpreting, objective observations, so I take EVERYTHING I see in the media with a grain of salt, that's doubly true for US media outlets.  The body of evidence is there to determine what Trump actually is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@THEFREEDOMPRSS @JesseKellyDC @iamthejayc That such a distinction has to be made is all part of the case in point...he is trying to play both sides. You are being played by a master manipulator and it's painful for the rest of the world to watch. Have some fucking respect for yourself.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@THEFREEDOMPRSS @JesseKellyDC @iamthejayc I did watch the video, I've seen all of this garbage before. I can't imagine any modern president having to be pressed to condemn racism. But that is exactly what happens with him.  The world sees him for what he is. But luckily, in mid-January that'll be done...good riddance.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@THEFREEDOMPRSS @JesseKellyDC @iamthejayc You're blaming Joe Biden for systemic racism, and I'm the clown??? Almost thought you weren't actually another Twitter troll for a second.  And posting shit from OAN thinking it makes your case...yep...you got me. 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@THEFREEDOMPRSS @JesseKellyDC @iamthejayc Trump can't even denounce white supremacy without sounding like a petulant child whose mother is standing, glaring behind him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@THEFREEDOMPRSS @JesseKellyDC @iamthejayc Come on. That bill was introduced in the mid '90s. Blaming it for systemic racism is just about as shortsighted as it gets. Biden is no prize pig as far as Presidents-elect go, but he can at least admit when he's wrong, which I'm fairly certain he's suggested w.r.t. that bill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@THEFREEDOMPRSS @JesseKellyDC @iamthejayc The analogy is doing the pros/cons thing at all when Donald Trump is one of the candidates, and then, in an extraordinarily baffling fashion, deciding that he'd be the one you vote for.   Do you really not see what he is?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoshuaHouck1 @JesseKellyDC @iamthejayc ...except Joe Biden. The President-elect. By any rational standard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarolineRenee15 @MarcTay63806396 @JesseKellyDC @iamthejayc Angry on the state of things in the US right now? Yeah.

<|startoftext|>@deAdder The real irony is that if he'd listened to the medical/epidemiological pros that were originally surrounding him in the early days of COVID-19, the mail-in vote MAY have been less of a factor, and he probably would have taken a second term easily.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Azula163 @EricVanFleet @CNN That might all be true, but as much as it pains me to say it, I don't really see any global initiative for tackling climate change amounting to much if the US isn't involved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricVanFleet @CNN It's about leadership. The US has the political and financial clout to lead they way on addressing climate change, and others will follow, but that's completely lost on the Trump administration.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@binyamintoo It looked to me like you didn't know what you're talking about...I made an attempt to clarify.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@binyamintoo But hey, joke's on me for trying to have a reasonable conversation, right? 🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@binyamintoo I'm not a doctor of immunology or epidemiology, but I have done my share of graduate-level research in a related field, so please don't shit on me because I use the right terms in the proper manner and context.   If you can use Twitter, you can probably find these things online<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@binyamintoo Scrap that first sentence, they are different, my apologies.  90% "false positive" means 90% of tests conducted yielded a positive outcome for test subjects that were, in fact, not infected with the target pathogen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@binyamintoo @musicmann20 @drdavidsamadi @realDonaldTrump You've said the same thing in different ways there.   I'm going to leave it at this: By definition, you cannot say a test has a sensitivity (able to detect infection) of 99%, a specificity (able to ID true negative) of 99%, and then have 90% of test results be false positive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@binyamintoo @musicmann20 @drdavidsamadi @realDonaldTrump I think you're taking the math one step too far. You've already said 100 in 10k will be false positive...the test is done and can only have one of 4 outcomes: True pos, true neg, false pos, false neg...you seem to be counting true negatives as false positives, after the fact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hawkeye626 @musicmann20 @drdavidsamadi @realDonaldTrump No doubt there's a ton of research to be done either way, but I couldn't see medical professionals using a test that is that inaccurate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hawkeye626 @musicmann20 @drdavidsamadi @realDonaldTrump I think the asymptomatic carrier issue has been pretty well established as a potential transmission route, but I'm sure there are indeed some false positives in there...I wouldn't hazard a guess on how many!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jake_poker @musicmann20 @drdavidsamadi @realDonaldTrump Yeeeaaahh. I'm the ignorant one. ✌🏻🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hawkeye626 @musicmann20 @drdavidsamadi @realDonaldTrump Can't argue with that point? The only point I was making here was that no one would use a diagnostic test that is potentially wrong 90% of the time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@binyamintoo @musicmann20 @drdavidsamadi @realDonaldTrump It makes no sense to state that a test with specificity at 99% would result in 90% false positives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@binyamintoo @musicmann20 @drdavidsamadi @realDonaldTrump Sorry, I did misread your response. But how does that math result in 90% false positives at any prevalence?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@binyamintoo @musicmann20 @drdavidsamadi @realDonaldTrump In practical use, sure, that's possible. When approving these tests, no one is going to make a decision based on a sample size of 10.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@musicmann20 @drdavidsamadi @realDonaldTrump Think critically about this for a second, would you? How would any medical test ever be approved and implemented if it had a chance of being wrong that often? It would be useless as a diagnostic tool. And it's not as though you could hide that in real-world use.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NTulsay @CNN The study indicates that test-positive cases are more likely to transmit the infection to those within their own age group.  It does not conclude that transmission from one age group to another, i.e. "kids to adults", doesn't happen.   Your comment is based on a logical fallacy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @HamillHimself, did you know about this?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CanadaMid @gluefactory @CBCNews There's a difference between being infected with a pathogen (i.e. SARS-Cov-2) and having a disease state caused by that pathogen (i.e. COVID-19).

<|startoftext|>@jkelly5128 @CBCAlerts What indication did I give you that I hope for more deaths? None. You were the one who said there's no pandemic.

<|startoftext|>Geezus...I feel for the people of California affected by those fires, but this is a meme for the ages.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@feltford It is absolutely remarkable how dumb current society is. Six months into this, and I had someone tweet a reply to me this morning saying this isn't a pandemic, it's the flu. 🤦🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jkelly5128 @CBCAlerts I showed you a simple piece of data from Sweden that paints a pretty clear picture and you ignored it. #Hypocrisy   Grasping at straws? Ha! Yeah, me and practically every public health expert I suppose...  Good luck to ya, bud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jkelly5128 @CBCAlerts The "lots of people die from the flu anyway" argument is truly baffling, as is the tendency by to ignore details related to the way the disease differs from seasonal flu.   It's akin to describing the impacts of a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico from the moon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jkelly5128 @CBCAlerts 2/2 Looking at table 11 of the available data file, which shows a monthly breakdown of deaths/100,000 for the country ("riket") right at the top, I'm not sure how you can say there was no extraordinary bump in the spring.  https://t.co/PrV98w3y4B<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jkelly5128 @CBCAlerts Thanks, I can read that.  I was curious why deaths/100,000 wasn't their chosen statistic so I had a look at the source of that data from the web address given on your chart.   If you haven't already done so, I would encourage you to do the same. 1/2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ctbutt114 @CBCNL It's only virtue signalling if the work doesn't continue on the larger issues you had mentioned previously. Just because a change is small doesn't mean it isn't meaningful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ctbutt114 @CBCNL Yup. 🤷🏻‍♂️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ctbutt114 @CBCNL I think you're right on those issues. They are large, complex problems that will take a lot of time and effort to change. And while those efforts go on, "smaller" things, like changing the name of a mountain, are tiny steps in the right direction. This change isn't to be feared.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ctbutt114 @CBCNL It's not whitewashing history, no one is suggesting we remove these historical recounts from history books or museums. It's about removing/renaming monuments intended to honour some awful f**king people, and hopefully restoring that honour to those far more deserving.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CNN How can you move forward when you base today's governance on blunt, word-for-word interpretation of a document written in the context of a newly formed nation 200 years ago? It's as though the US has legislated its own obsolescence, becoming more dysfunctional as time passes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CTVNews And they'll move on to likely be hired in other law enforcement positions, or at least find some manner of work. George Floyd and countless other black folks will not have that opportunity. These officers have voluntarily self-identified as being part of the problem.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bosepheris @goodtimeguy78 @CTVNews Yes, people can succeed in the face of adversity. That can be a great thing. But when you live in a society where, all things being equal, having white skin gives you a leg up from birth, that is a problem.   Denying that this problem exists only makes you part of the problem.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bosepheris @goodtimeguy78 @CTVNews Holy fuck, dude. If you think Ben Carson's very existence is proof that there's no systemic racism, that's where I'm out.  But in the future, if you're going to call someone "*etarded", you might want to check your grammar...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@goodtimeguy78 @bosepheris @CTVNews You don't seem to get that everything you two are saying in this thread validates that "ridiculous, virtue-signalling liberal nonsense". But please, keep going...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bosepheris @goodtimeguy78 @CTVNews Let's get this straight, you're actually trying to say that black "culture" is the problem, but systemic racism is not? Do I really need to point out the problem with that?   And for the record, "let's have the discussion" should probably come before the "*etard alert"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Natluvscamping @goodtimeguy78 @CTVNews Nah, just unwilling to sweep casual racism under the rug.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@goodtimeguy78 @CTVNews This comment shows precisely how racism becomes systemic racism. And next thing you know, your neighbour is being unjustifiably killed by someone tasked with upholding the law.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@yeepoa @snackspecialist @CherryAmes22 @CBCAlerts And still likely more of a live animal handling issue than a food handling issue, but I'm not familiar with that case right off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@snackspecialist @yeepoa @CherryAmes22 @CBCAlerts Fair enough. But the chances that a food animal gets infected by a human carrier are probably equally remote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@snackspecialist @yeepoa @CherryAmes22 @CBCAlerts And far as the raw steak suggestion goes, that's simply not the way that works with foodborne illness, with the exception of certain parasites.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@snackspecialist @yeepoa @CherryAmes22 @CBCAlerts Out of the question, perhaps not since absolutes have a way of being not-so-absolute, but there is not a shred of evidence to suggest that either H1N1 or SARS-Cov-2 can be acquired through food handling or consumption of properly cooked foods.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CherryAmes22 @CBCAlerts This has nothing to do with anything other than the close proximity in which the employees and inspectors in these plant work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What the f**king f**k??? Yes, let's celebrate those who are fighting mass sickness/death by harkening back to a day of mass f**king death.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Theshells1111 @CBCAlerts Let's say he did just that. Tell me what happens if in 4-8 weeks we double our incidence (rate of new cases) of COVID-19 cases and/or hospitalizations. Where do we go from there?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Theshells1111 @CBCAlerts I'm aware of the economic situation. You've yet to tell me how bombarding an already-stressed healthcare system with a wave of new COVID-19 cases is going to solve anything. If you want to answer that, go for it, otherwise, I think I'm done here. Stay safe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Theshells1111 @CBCAlerts Measured re-opening. Say it with me now...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Theshells1111 @CBCAlerts So yes, more evidence that our efforts have kept us within capacity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Theshells1111 @CBCAlerts If we abandon those efforts as you suggest "hard/fast", this virus will come back, and then we're overloading a system that has had no time to recover/resupply. If you can't understand that, I can't help you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Theshells1111 @CBCAlerts Without fact-checking numbers or specifics of whether those were ICU beds, etc., we have done well to stay within the capacity of our healthcare system. With all due respect for those that have died &amp; their families, that is evidence that what we're doing as a country is working<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Theshells1111 @CBCAlerts The fact that you think the way to solve issues with our healthcare system is to open up society/economy in a way that is likely to result in a massive increase in COVID-19 cases is ludicrous. It's like saying you're going to put out a fire by smothering it with gasoline.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Theshells1111 @CBCAlerts As I've said, there is A LOT of negative inpact on our healthcare system as a result of COVID-19. How can you possibly think we're in a position to "open fast/hard" at this time without plunging our healthcare system into futher disarray?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Theshells1111 @CBCAlerts No one knows enough about this virus to make that conclusion. There's no doubt that this whole thing has had a negative impact on our health care system, but it is absurd to think that abandoning precautions such as social distancing at this time will help alleviate that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Theshells1111 @CBCAlerts Measured re-opening of the economy can be done without abandoning all of the precautions we have in place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Theshells1111 @CBCAlerts There are ways to offset all of the things you mentioned while these temporary measures are in place to stop the spread. The sub-set of the population ready to simply jump back into their pre-COVID routine should be far more alarming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Theshells1111 @CBCAlerts Trust me, I'm not "fed" anything. You're right, there are more options. But you didn't suggest anything other than "OPEN THE FREAKING PARKS AND PLAYGROUNDS".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Theshells1111 @CBCAlerts So, either you have no problem with old folks dying of COVID-19, or you have no clue about community spread with respect to vulnerable populations. Which is it?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NEvansBC @MarilynMovies @CBCAlerts It's not a matter of wanting the border open, it's a matter of not making knee-jerk reactions based on poor information.

<|startoftext|>@NEvansBC @MarilynMovies @CBCAlerts Is that your professional opinion, doctor? Not everything is solved by closing a border, you don't have to look far for proof of that. But I'm guessing objective evidence isn't something you tend to look for...🙄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sportsnet @BlueJays Two weird takeaways I had from re-watching this game:  1. With all the hits/runners/runs/general action, that field was HAGGARD looking at the end! 2.

<|startoftext|>@MarilynMovies @CBCAlerts This is an excellent take on the situation. Unfortunate, but excellent. I firmly believe that the government has made decisions based on the best available information at the time, and it would be tough to expect more at the federal level given the regional diversity of Canada.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@eh_vegas @BBCWorld He's doing exactly what he should be, deferring to actual public health professionals that know how to tackle this sort of thing.

<|startoftext|>@eldiego104ever @cnni I'd be willing to bet that Brazil, Germany, and a host of other top tier men's footy nations would say the #USMNT does not actually COMPETE on their level. The #USWNT, on the other hand, are cream of the crop in their game.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yet another example of how stupid #Trump is. You can keep your own people from listening in (sort of...), but those on the other end of the line sure as hell won't be imposing those limits.

<|startoftext|>@wolfster20038 @CMolonet @MJMcKean That's the thing though. He's not the antichrist. He's a man. A morally and intellectually bankrupt man.

<|startoftext|>@DanielDelage3 @CNN So swear him in, and put him on the witness stand. Easy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bendonaldson33 @CNN That has nothing to do with Trump's actions. If they want to investigate the Bidens, great, go for it. But they aren't on trial here.

<|startoftext|>@McIvorben @CBCAlerts @CBCNews You do make a solid point about "sound bites" and social media all the same.

<|startoftext|>@McIvorben @CBCAlerts @CBCNews What makes you think using the word 'novel' injects personal opinion into the discussion?

<|startoftext|>Anybody out there want to tell me again that the Weber for Subban trade was a mistake for the #Habs?  #NHL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Hey #Trump-voters, how do you possibly have so little self-respect that you would vote for him when he so blatantly lies to you day after day after day? He depends on the idea that you're too stupid or careless to check him. How? How do you stand for that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TSN_Sports You can talk this up as much as you want, it'll probably get some folks to tune into TradeCentre on the day, but it's not happening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBCAlerts This is akin to me saying I will personally spearhead the attack if Canada invades Mars.   There will be no such invasion. There will be no such subpoena.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump That airstrike didn't quite do what you thought it would at home, eh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unreal. #Gold #WorldJuniors #WorldJuniors2020 #TeamCanada<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HockeywthHannah That's something that the North American teams consider, especially with those "walk-the-line"-type players...not that there are a ton of those these days.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HockeywthHannah Having experienced such a thing, I'd say it is worth considering that if there's no (very little...) risk to aggravating the injury, then sure, give it a go. Otherwise, I agree 100%, 18-19 yo players shouldn't be taking that risk.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bramhabs98 @BrabynHugh @CanadiensMTL I feel your pain, man, but what's the sense in sacrificing the future to make up for the past? If we were squarely in a playoff spot right now, I'd be a little more inclined to agree with you, but the team isn't ready either way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bramhabs98 @BrabynHugh @CanadiensMTL So, trading away a bunch of good prospects or picks to squeak into the playoffs, and likely make an early exit is a better idea?   Gotta have a bit more patience than that, man! I want to watch some playoff hockey too, but we're not close enough to sell out right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrabynHugh @CanadiensMTL I don't think enough people understand that last bit you said. I think Bergevin has the team headed in the right direction...but injuries and uncharacteristically poor net-minding are making for a rough one<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gregory42424242 @JMarkEnriquez1 @chrismpeters Canada would have the head-to-head tie-breaker if tied with the US having beaten them in the first game. Assuming they win they last two, as you said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TSN_Sports It was disrespectful, the coach will talk to him no doubt, and that will be, and should be, the end of it.   It's hilarious how quickly Canadians start shitting all over these kids when they blow a game like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sportsnet @HC_WJC @ByMikeShulman Does that really need to be the photo that goes along with the story??? Kid screaming in pain? WTF Sportsnet, do better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JMarkEnriquez1 @chrismpeters Head-to-head is the first tie-breaker, so if the US manages to beat Russia tomorrow, Canada has a decent chance of winning their pool.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HockeywthHannah I think if the hockey culture that's allowed these kinds of things to happen is going to change, we have to give some room for guys that are trying to truly atone, as it seems Crawford is, to do it, otherwise it gets driven underground and nothing changes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mr_hoeber @celeste43_ @HockeyCanada I don't think this move will prevent that from happening. And it might very well contribute to the inclusivity in the long run.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@affabletoaster Tough one. My only suggestion is that you somehow rig an 8-foot-wide flaming hoop to a pair of suspenders and wear that while you shop for your own protection.   Full disclosure: this is likely to cause other issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mr_hoeber @celeste43_ @HockeyCanada And yeah, we functioned just fine with the old labels, but times have changed, and Hockey Canada is showing that they can roll with those changes. As they should.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mr_hoeber @celeste43_ @HockeyCanada So what exactly is your point here? Was it a waste of time/money/effort or money/time/effort well spent?  I'm sure Hockey Canada did the homework they felt was warranted in making the decision.  All I said was, I don't think it was a hard one to make ultimately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mr_hoeber @celeste43_ @HockeyCanada Not all decisions require the same level of analysis. Such as this one. Bring us in line with IIHF classifications...check. Remove outdated names for those classifications...check. My guess is there wasn't a lot of resistance to this within Hockey Canada.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaketapper Easy there, Jake! Those are facts you're throwing around. A Republican might lose an eye.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mr_hoeber @celeste43_ @HockeyCanada So if money is spent, it's poorly spent, but if little/no money is spent, it's a poorly made decision. Right. Got it. 🙄<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RaptorKing13 @Bryan_Leitch @ericjdunnett @timandsid @Rogers And if he had phrased it like that, the point would have been made. Instead he unfairly targeted a particular group of people and  undercut his own argument in the process.   As for Ron Maclean, at least he had the good sense to apologize for his part.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RuthAnnMichaud1 @CTVNews Ladies and gentlemen, today's poster child for (thinly) veiled racism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewhouseDale @ashleyjmorton So, in your opinion, targeting a specific group of people and deriding that whole group without cause is fine because it's free speech?   Free speech does not equate to freedom from consequences of the things you say.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Joe_C_London @64Miramichi @CBCMorningLive @CBCNews @fitz_meagan @cbchh You never have a hand in deciding who wins the Cup, regardless of who you cheer for.   You always have a hand in deciding who your gov't is. But if you're happy with having someone else decide for you, that's completely up to you, of course.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joe_C_London @64Miramichi @CBCMorningLive @CBCNews @fitz_meagan @cbchh The point I was making is that you can decide not to watch hockey, but you can't decide to not have a government. Regardless of whether you vote or not, someone will form the gov't, so you might as well have a say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlbertansFirst @CBCNL @CPC_HQ Yeah, separation should fix that whole landlocked thing nicely. 🙄👍🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Joe_C_London @64Miramichi @CBCMorningLive @CBCNews @fitz_meagan @cbchh The difference is that you don't have to watch hockey at all. One of these parties is going to head up the government regardless of whether you cast a vote or not.   You may as well have a say in that. #Vote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dwancherry I think it goes deeper than that. This should go down in history as The Twitter Election because it seems like policy-be-damned mudslinging was all there was to the campaign.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CTVNews So, @AndrewScheer, "Canadians can't afford" to have political parties working together in government?

It's a long game that we have to address now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WheyCooler @TeraBurks1 @sheermon @retrover16 @CNN So, if the world doesn't end in the next few years, it negates the need for us to change the way we treat the planet?

<|startoftext|>@retrover16 @sheermon @CNN Partisan politics and greed changes neither the facts of climate change, nor the need to hold those in power accountable for what's being done, or not done, about it.  If kids like Greta Thunberg are the future leaders/politicians, we might still have a chance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@retrover16 @sheermon @CNN Incorrect.   What Cris (yes, that's the proper spelling) wants, is for people to focus their knowledge, experience, and energy on acknowledging and addressing the climate change problem, not tearing down a 16-year-old girl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sheermon @retrover16 @CNN No. I asked a question.   Here's another one: What makes you think her emotions are uncontrolled? Because she's upset about the direction the planet's headed in?  One more: What makes you think her parents are "using her"? From what I see, they are letting her use her voice. 👏🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sheermon @retrover16 @CNN So you all assume that since she's on the spectrum that she's completely unable to make rationale decisions or understand the true gravity of the climate crisis?

<|startoftext|>@Rockchip77 @Former_TV_COP @CBCNews What exactly is "fake news" about climate change?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rockchip77 @Former_TV_COP @CBCNews Not likely, and you and I may not see that catastrophe in our lifetime, but the fact of the matter is that human activity has us on a path that will eventually make our planet, or much of it, uninhabitable. We have to start changing that now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBCNews This is absolute BS. Just because #Bernier and the so-called #PPC have latched onto #Trump -style tactics for the upcoming election, it doesn't negate the science and the fact of climate change. It's not a partisan issue, it's everyone's issue, whether you like it or not.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jeremyhorbuL @TSN_Sports No disrespect, but I'm not sure I'd be a fan of that. There will always be a draw for a certain subset of players to play under the spotlight in big markets, and giving advantages to the already rich would kill parity, which is one thing the #NHL has over other NA pro leagues IMO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremyhorbuL @TSN_Sports And Price is still making $10.5M/y...the term is great for the Habs though! If it were up to me, at the risk of being unpopular, I'd have a hard cap on individual player salaries...imagine how different the #NHL would look if the max individual salary was $8M/y<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Damir27715455 @TSN_Sports ...it's a lot easier to cool off hot scorers in the playoffs than it is to overcome a team with good depth and a solid D.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Damir27715455 @TSN_Sports Sure, but when you have to dress 20 guys every night, spending an eighth of your cap number on one guys is going to be a tough pill to swallow for any team that's in a position to contend. Your point about scoring forwards is bang-on...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jeremyhorbuL @TSN_Sports ...nor do the agents, I'm sure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TSN_Sports Here's what I don't get: All these players say that winning a cup is their dream, so why would these guys not take, say, 6-8M, and leave your team some cap space to sign other players that further your chances of winning?  Depth wins cups.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RVon1984 @CNN ...there'd be a 5-year window to either have the weapon modified so the round has to be manually recycled, or turn in the weapon. I'd also institute a 3 round max for any civilian firearm. Don't bother telling me how unpopular that would be, I'm fully aware, but you asked!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RVon1984 @stillngam @CNN To be perfectly honest, if I had my way, I'd ban auto-loading firearms, with the exception of thise uses by the military and law enforcement, and institute some sort of free surrender or buyback program. For those that are currently in existence...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bozzoot @chrisdelia FFS...that's because trucks aren't built to kill.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RVon1984 @CNN "Nothing can be done"? Yep...that kind of thinking should move the issue along #sarcasm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RVon1984 @CNN ...but being under the thumb of Trump and the NRA was more important to them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RVon1984 @stillngam @CNN Dude, the fact that you hate liberals doesn't change anything. As I mentioned previously that the Dems inaction can certainly be raised, but the fact remains that the GOP had 2 years recently, right in the thick of the chaos, where they could have done something with gun laws...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@K1mibear @jaketapper @KamalaHarris @BernieSanders @CNNSotu On that point, I agree with you completely. But that doesn't address the gun problem in America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lostnswv @notchuraverage1 @LeahBShepherd @bjoewolf @jaketapper @CNNSotu @JulianCastro @BetoORourke @CoryBooker @PeteButtigieg All that does is limit the number of voters...just what the #GOP would like to see.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@K1mibear @jaketapper @KamalaHarris @BernieSanders @CNNSotu The #GOP is GIVING the #Dems that platform by allying themselves with the NRA and the other 2nd Amendment nutters. It's astonishing that a gun is apparently important than a life to that subset, and the current admin. will say nothing because they have no plan to do anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RVon1984 @stillngam @CNN 3/3 The GOP controlled all 3 from 2016-18, and they did nothing either, but it's a moot point as long as the status quo remains...people are still being killed en masse, and the US government won't pull in the same direction to do something about it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RVon1984 @stillngam @CNN 2/3 You can make the argument that the Dems had the WH/House/Senate from 2008-10 and "didn't do anything", but if you look at deaths from mass shootings, and gun deaths in general, for similar periods before and after 2010, the trend is obvious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RVon1984 @stillngam @CNN First off, I'm a Canadian, living in Canada, so it's not "my" Dem party. Second, you're missing the point I was making. The president can't snap his fingers and fix this in a meaningful way without having the House and Senate on board, i.e. it requires a BIPARTISAN effort. 1/3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RVon1984 @stillngam @CNN You realize that one person, regardless if it's Obama or that orange moron, can't solve this problem. It needs to be a bipartisan effort at all gov't levels, but the GOP won't have it because their voting base and the NRA are stuck in the 18th century.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@perlmutations FWIW, I agree 100%. I'm not American, I don't live in the US, but I'm still not willing to turn a blind eye. What this poor excuse for a president does, has an impact everywhere.   Easy to see here in Canada that #Trump's racist and bigoted rhetoric has emboldened the like-minded<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickPapagiorg18 @TheBlownGasket @CBCAlerts My apologies, I've been busy all day but I just had a chance to scroll through your tweets/replies...I understand where all this comes from now. I'm very happy to say we have different outlooks on the world.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NickPapagiorg18 @TheBlownGasket @CBCAlerts So the fact that the Premier's office felt compelled comment on this, referring specifically to "Hate, racism and intolerance...", tells you nothing about the validity of this "claim"? Like I said before...part of the problem...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickPapagiorg18 @TheBlownGasket @CBCAlerts Did you bother reading the story? If you ignore the context of the video, what you say might seem reasonable. But. Everything leading up to the filming of this was clearly racially motivated.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@justinallen1976 @Texas_Toon It was always going to be a slow process.

<|startoftext|>@CBCNews @matt_kwong Let's call a spade, a spade. The Saudis are doing what @realDonaldTrump wishes he could do, and #Trump's only concern is the state of his arms deal. Is the world going to allow the brazen, apparently government-santioned murder of a journalist to simply slide by?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TSN_Sports This is why I hate the money side of pro sports. FFS...guy's effectively an unproven player in the world's best hockey league, won't take 6 million to play on a team with a chance to legitimately compete for a Stanley Cup? How do you say "I'm only here for the cash" in Swedish?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tisshe I am!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Toronto's has to be the only #NHL rink where the entire lower bowl looks as though they've been given written instructions on what to do when the home team scores a goal. #NHLFaceoff #MapleLeafs #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just let that sink in for a minute.  The #GOP doesn't feel that allegations of sexual misconduct against a #SCOTUS nominee should be investigated by the proper authorities.   A Supreme Court nominee.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One can only hope that there are GOP senators that are saying they'll vote to confirm #Kavanaugh, who will in fact oppose when it comes time to cast the vote.   Otherwise there will be an accused sex offender on the #SCOTUS, and the GOP didn't feel compelled to investigate that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The best part was when the UN laughed at you. The United Nations General Assembly. Laughed. At. You.   Nations of the world, united in laughter! What a wonderful world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanadiensMTL Or the love child he had with Janice from Electric Mayhem...  https://t.co/sd9ryB638b<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My god. This mascot is awesome. I thoroughly love mascots that make absolutely no sense. Looks like #Youppi! hooked up with Janice from Electric Mayhem, and this was their love child. Good on ya finding work, son! #NHL #MuppetShow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My guess is that the Foo Fighters would have a hard time choking down the over-hyped-lip-sync-pseudo-performance that is the SB halftime show.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dwancherry I wanna see this guy and #Youppi! throw down. We need more absolutely ridiculous mascots like this...incredible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theScoreNHL @theScore My guess is this had more to do with his attitude/personality than anything else.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And with that tweet the Piece-of-Shit-In-Chief just stated that he believes any victim of sexual abuse/harassment that doesn't immediately file charges is no victim at all. #America, this is your president.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theScore I really hope this movie ends with them losing to the #GoldenStateWarriors. #NBA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My view was somewhat obscured by excitement and whiskey on Saturday night, so I just watched #GGGvsCanelo2 again. I still do not see how #Canelo wins this. Gotta say, I think #GGG got robbed. What a fight though...#GGGvsCanelo3 please!?!?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ConcernedofTW @CNN I get what you're saying. But I guess if you own it, you take the power away from those that use it negatively. Let's face it, they're probably not bright enough to come up with a new slur!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ConcernedofTW @CNN Some folks don't identify with the L, B, G or T. You can add 2+ to the end of that too...inclusiveness is a beautiful thing, man! ✌🏻<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I tend to have a @stingraymusic video channel on the TV a lot lately. They just played a #MichaelBolton cover of (Sitting On) The Dock of the Bay. Had to immediately turn it off and get #OtisRedding on. Not this day, Michael Bolton. NOT THIS DAY!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Paolo447210 @adamrobertson48 @TSN_Sports I agree that it's wise to shield him from the pressure, as much as that's possible in Toronto, but with no one wearing a C in that room, there's always going to be a "when's  Mathews going to be named captain?" watch going on. Put the C on Marleau and stifle that conversation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adamrobertson48 @TSN_Sports And if an elite player in today's NHL says he doesn't care about not having a letter, I don't believe it for a second.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adamrobertson48 @TSN_Sports I'm not saying they should put it on him now. But if there's not a guy in the room wearing a "C", the media are going to seek out someone to key on when things are rough, and it's going to be Mathews. For whatever reason, the group leadership thing doesn't work in the NHL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TSN_Sports If I was a #Leafs fan, I'd be concerned that management haven't been able to pick a captain from the guys in the room since Dion Phaneuf. It's clearly a waiting game to hand it to Matthews, but I'm not sure how they think the team is benefitting from this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The danger is real.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @AngrySensGnome, see you in the battle for last place!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gadus07 @CanadiensMTL @darekmoreau @tweettie_J_bird As far as the front office goes, it's hard for me to have a good perspective on it when my footy team is owned by Mike Ashley!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tweettie_J_bird @gadus07 @CanadiensMTL @darekmoreau I like that Pacioretty is gone. Having that elephant in the room all season would have been a damned sight worse than it's already going to be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dwancherry @GoodDogLogic Dogs beat me to it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Man. Team #Nike just burned the defense with a 98 yard TD pass. And no one knew it, but Colin Kaepernick was the man under center! Hey, @realDonaldTrump, can't wait to see your meltdown! #NFL #Trump<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@terrycrews Quite literally did this in Nashville last October! 😆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarDown Very cool and a genuine milestone to be sure, but why gift these to a guy who has such wealth already? Why not auction them off for charity or something like that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Awesome Canadians celebrating a birthday today: Perdita Felicien, Chris Hadfield, Greg Keelor, Carter Rycroft, Amanda Marshall, Sean Cullen, Aurèle Joliat, and me!   Honourable mention: Jay Onrait!  @JayOnrait @Cmdr_Hadfield @GregKeelor @perditafelicien @MrSeanCullen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RR_Hayes While I don't agree that the laws have little effect, it's definitely a problem that's more complex than simply amending or instituting legislation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RR_Hayes Agreed absolutely. The question is do we really need those kinds of guns in the hands of Canadians at all? Granted, the smuggling of illegal guns over the border likely presents a greater threat, and clearly should be addressed, but I think the question is worth asking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RR_Hayes Agreed, lower is better. But if you wade into a gun debate, it matters. Luckily for Canada, we don't have the gun problem that the US has, and I'd like it to stay that way, hence my thumbs up for examining our options for achieving that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RR_Hayes Honestly, if we can learn something from any country, it's worth a listen. I doubt that more guns, or looser restrictions are the answers, but if the numbers speak, there is likely a reason.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RR_Hayes Interesting. What's the rate on actual firearms-related homicide?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yamahapianobest As I said, I mis-spoke. Yet your argument is that I know nothing because of that single point. And that's a commonality between argumentative gun nuts! Ignore the true argument, focus on semantics. Anyway, lunch is done...peace. ✌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yamahapianobest I said looks and/or functions...obviously a paintball marker that looks like an MP5 is a different animal than an AR-15<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yamahapianobest A switch to select between options for what happens when the trigger is pulled: 1 rd, 2/3 rd burst, full auto...like I said, unlikely to be found on consumer weapons, I mis-spoke, all apologies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yamahapianobest And again, where did I say that? I'm pretty sure one could quickly find a firearm that looks "friendly" and fires full auto, which of course, would be, as it should be, illegal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yamahapianobest Come on man. I will actually retract that one since full auto obviously wouldn't be a function of consumer weapons...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yamahapianobest It's not about the license holders, it's about the availability of the guns. Where did I say I didn't know rifles were restricted to 5 rounds? You inferred that point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yamahapianobest The definition is my own, because it's a perfectly logical description. Functionality: Grip, sights, firing selector, calibre...all possibles. Also, "similar" does not mean "same", but hey, grade 4 is hard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yamahapianobest Says the young pr*ck who doesn't know how to use it properly. We're having a great laugh at this by the way!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yamahapianobest Uh, a weapon, in this case a firearm, that is built to resemble and/or function similarly to a weapon used by military or law enforcement personnel...any more completely inane questions? Just in case you missed it the first time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yamahapianobest Uh, a weapon, in this case a firearm, that is built to resemble and/or function similarly to a weapon used by military or law enforcement personnel...any more completely inane questions?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yamahapianobest @Stray03 @Dew_Harley Show me a source for your numbers. And it's "borders"...a "boarder" is someone co-habitating in a home, or slang for a skate-boarder.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stray03 Typical. No quotable sources. Time to stop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stray03 @Dew_Harley Take a look at gun violence in the UK and Australia...like I told you before, you have no clue about my thought process.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stray03 You have no idea what I think, or how I come to form my opinions. Show me these studies you're talking about. If you think a gun argument is what's pivotal for an election win in Canada, I can't even imagine how far out there you are<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stray03 @Dew_Harley I guess you have all the answers, we're all glad you have it figured out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stray03 Thanks for your input. Very informative.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@leeflaman @bphiam @CBCAlerts Another enlightened comment. Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamJSheridan @CBCAlerts Google, ha, ok bud.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamJSheridan @CBCAlerts Dude, I grew up around guns and hunting, had the old FAC, and know damned well an AR-15 vs. .308 Remington bolt action vs. a pump action shotgun with modified choke...your condescension is noted. It's not about looking scary, it's about the intent of the design.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dew_Harley @bphiam @CBCAlerts It's not a problem with a single cause. And I don't think anyone is suggesting that it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MGB_CDN @falardof @bphiam @CBCAlerts So you're saying that the government does nothing about mental health/smuggling/gangs?  And it isn't a question of whether "you" can be trusted, it's does the risk to the general public of having these guns readily available outweigh their need/use in the hands of the public<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MGB_CDN @falardof @bphiam @CBCAlerts No one is saying that the issues you mention here don't need to be addressed. Personally I think those are all factors, but denying that the legal availability of these weapons is a contributing factor is equally foolish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamJSheridan @CBCAlerts I'm no expert on gun laws, so though I'm aware of limits on mag capacity for some types of guns, the comment was meant to be an umbrella statement. And I use the term "military-style" because if anyone says "assault rifle", gun nuts love jump all over that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MGB_CDN @BrianBeardo @bphiam @CBCAlerts Drawing equivalence between a car, designed a means of transportation, and a style of gun designed with one sole purpose is so far off the track for such a conversation that it's ridiculous. Come back with an actual talking point if you like, otherwise, please stop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bphiam @CBCAlerts We don't need handguns and military-style semi-autos in the hands of the average citizen. That doesn't impede any Canadian from owning and using firearms a variety of other firearms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBCAlerts Glad to hear it. Anything we can come up with to keep ahead of the insanity in the US is a good thing. IMO, an outright ban on military-style semi-auto rifles, and limiting everything else to 5 round mags would be a start.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome That being said, the Royals have won every game I've seen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome I can't believe I've still only seen 1 MLB game in person.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Right now, it takes 2 hours to play a futbol match with 90 mins of playing time. Personally I'd like to see refs handing out yellows like business cards for time wasting and diving!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome You may be right, but if the clock isn't running, there is going to be no sense of urgency to resume play which in turn will ultimately draw out the real time from kick-off to final whistle. I.e. it takes 3 hrs of real time to play an NFL/NBA/NHL game with 60 mins of playing time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome ...which is what will happen if clock stoppages are introduced. They need to start handing out more cards for diving and time wasting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome I agree, that's a stupid proposal. I am, however, not a fan of stopping the clock. Right now, barring extra time/penalties, you can count on a match being done in 2 hrs. I do not want to see these games ballooning into 3 - 3.5 hour affairs...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@darekmoreau @AngryPensGnome Well, FWIW, I think the Vegas team was a mistake looking at it long term, but it's a hell of a lot more fun to see them with a competitive team as opposed to the usual expansion doormats.

<|startoftext|>@mattcapranos @OrneryJustin @GeoffVendacopy @CBCNews @p_evans Classic pro-gun logic. You're essentially saying that the deaths and injuries from these shootings are acceptable because people die from lots of other stuff too. Got it. Thanks for the education. Please tag me out of any other comments you have on this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattcapranos @OrneryJustin @GeoffVendacopy @CBCNews @p_evans It's not potential for harm, it's real, actual injuries and death! How many people have been killed in mass shootings in schools, clubs, concerts, etc in the past 20 years?   This is not, "I'm scared bad things will happen", it's real people getting fucking killed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattcapranos @OrneryJustin @GeoffVendacopy @CBCNews @p_evans Deter crime? Maybe not, but if a shooter had a 5 or 8 round mag, you'd stand a hell of a lot better chance of escape than if he's firing from a 30 round mag.  If kids and others weren't getting killed en masse by those weapons, I frankly wouldn't care if civilians had them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattcapranos @OrneryJustin @GeoffVendacopy @CBCNews @p_evans Nice job missing the point...again. A screwdriver is a tool with a purpose other than killing. The kinds of guns I've been referring to were based on a design with one purpose, to kill people. A semi-auto firearm with a 30 round capacity is not necessary for civilians.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattcapranos @OrneryJustin @GeoffVendacopy @CBCNews @p_evans Again, it's always something other than the guns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattcapranos @OrneryJustin @GeoffVendacopy @CBCNews @p_evans Luckily we don't have the rampant gun violence here in Canada that our southern neighbours do, and our laws surrounding guns no doubt have something to do with that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattcapranos @OrneryJustin @GeoffVendacopy @CBCNews @p_evans So the argument again is, "we can't do anything about it, so let's not try"?   The fact that some people do things that are illegal does not negate the value of the law they're breaking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattcapranos @OrneryJustin @GeoffVendacopy @CBCNews @p_evans I've said time and time again, "semi-autos with high cap mags". Not all guns. Not all semi-autos. If you aren't going to stick to the facts of what I said, stop talking, or tag me out of your tweets. But hey, that seems to be the MO of the right wing gun-toters, no?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattcapranos @GeoffVendacopy @OrneryJustin @CBCNews @p_evans The blame ALWAYS gets pushed off somewhere else...it's absolutely baffling. If that guy hadn't had a load of semi-auto rifles with high cap mags and bump stocks, he doesn't injure/kill ~600 people...fact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattcapranos @OrneryJustin @GeoffVendacopy @CBCNews @p_evans Pump action shotgun, still a gun...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattcapranos @OrneryJustin @GeoffVendacopy @CBCNews @p_evans ....a bolt action rifle, still a gun...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattcapranos @OrneryJustin @GeoffVendacopy @CBCNews @p_evans Nobody said, "no guns for US citizens". If they were to ban high capacity, semi-auto firearms, that still leaves a plethora of guns and gun types for people to get off on...even the ones that want concealed carry. A semi-auto pistol with 5 round cap is still a gun...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattcapranos @GeoffVendacopy @OrneryJustin @CBCNews @p_evans And what would a "good guy with a gun" have done in the Vegas shooting?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OrneryJustin @mattcapranos @GeoffVendacopy @CBCNews @p_evans There's change required at a number of levels obviously, but America is gun crazy as a society, and the rights of gun holders continue to trump the rights of kids to not get f**king shot to death!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OrneryJustin @mattcapranos @GeoffVendacopy @CBCNews @p_evans The focus is on gun control because this keeps happening over and over again, and politicians seem to be fine with it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OrneryJustin @mattcapranos @GeoffVendacopy @CBCNews @p_evans I'm pretty sure everyone on the planet has acknowledged that there were a shitload of mistakes made in that situation by law enforcement folks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OrneryJustin @mattcapranos @GeoffVendacopy @CBCNews @p_evans And what do you suppose your need is going to be? Gov't coming to getcha? They have better weapons than you, pretty sure of that. Home invader? If you can't fend them of with 5 rounds, I doubt you'll do it with 30...that is providing they don't take your weapon first...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattcapranos @OrneryJustin @GeoffVendacopy @CBCNews @p_evans 2/2...or be a hinderance to police/agents that are trained to deal with those situations i.e. instead of one person with a gun, now there are 20 that the police have to consider as potential threats<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattcapranos @OrneryJustin @GeoffVendacopy @CBCNews @p_evans When I said "good guy with a gun" I was obviously referring to civilians, not police or the like. And without training to deal with active shooter situation, an unconscionable majority of CCW holders are either going to shit their pants like everyone else...1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OrneryJustin @mattcapranos @GeoffVendacopy @CBCNews @p_evans Yes, people can be killed with trucks, knives, etc., but do you think that fact actually justifies the wide-spread availability of high capacity, semi-automatic firearms?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OrneryJustin @mattcapranos @GeoffVendacopy @CBCNews @p_evans Ok, so go ahead and list all the instances where the good guy with a gun has prevented a mass casualty situation. I'm sure you can come up with a few, but how do those numbers compare with the deaths and injuries from mass shootings in the US?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OrneryJustin @mattcapranos @GeoffVendacopy @CBCNews @p_evans Dude, all you know about me is that which I post on Twitter. Don't assume you know what I think, or why I think it.   If you can't see the value in potentially reducing deaths due to the wide-spread availability of unnecessary weapons, I can't help you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattcapranos @GeoffVendacopy @OrneryJustin @CBCNews @p_evans Yup. We've all seen this BS from gun nuts too. We do, in fact, need large trucks unless you want to transport goods via horse and buggy. And here's the kicker: Trucks were not designed as implements to kill people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sean_shadilay @CBCNews @p_evans The reason civilians shouldn't have them has been painfully clear in the US for a long time now. And if you can't make your point without being derogatory, just stop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sean_shadilay @CBCNews @p_evans I'm in no way anti-gun. I am a proponent of making it extremely hard for the people that might carry out mass shootings to have the tools to do so. Easy way to start is to limit the number of high cap semi-autos, making them harder and more expensive to find.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mattcapranos @CBCNews @p_evans But it might stop 17.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sean_shadilay @CBCNews @p_evans Moot point. If it's semi-auto and has a high capacity magazine (i.e. more than 5-10 rds), it doesn't need to be in the hands of a civilian. Gun nuts are using the definition of "assault rifle" as a ridiculously thin defence...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN Almost blacked out from laughing so hard at this. I keep hoping he's going to rip off his facial prosthetics to reveal he's actually #AndyKaufman .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pietro_fiz @CTVNews @NRA The car wasn't based on a design that was intended to kill people. If that fact escapes you, there's not much of a discussion to be had. Civilians don't need semi-automatic weapons.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Leaerjet @03_jensen @Bigbootyarce @ReiverHall @CNN How exactly am I misinformed? Stats on those types of shootings in the UK, Australia, and Canada seem to correlate with that point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Leaerjet @03_jensen @Bigbootyarce @ReiverHall @CNN Your argument is fallacious. If someone is going to break a law, they will find a way to do it. The whole point is that if these weapons aren't readily available, they are harder and more expensive to get hold of, and it's much less likely these shootings happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@03_jensen @Bigbootyarce @Leaerjet @ReiverHall @CNN I agree with you to a degree on this. Fact is the AR-15 looks like a military weapon designed to kill people, and it has been used to do just that by civilians, so it's kind of become the symbol for what's wrong with having this type of firearm in the public sphere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@03_jensen @Bigbootyarce @Leaerjet @ReiverHall @CNN AR (or other SA rifle) vs Glock: Depends on the circumstances. The Las Vegas shooter couldn't have done what he did with a Glock.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@03_jensen @Bigbootyarce @Leaerjet @ReiverHall @CNN So why does a civilian need a semi-auto handgun that holds 16 rounds? They don't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@03_jensen @Bigbootyarce @Leaerjet @ReiverHall @CNN With regard to weapons available tk civilians, of course.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@03_jensen @Bigbootyarce @Leaerjet @ReiverHall @CNN It's not about the type of gun. It's about their capability to kill. I'm a proponent for bans or heavy restrictions on any gun with "high" capacity mags, and/or high rate of fire. Of course, there are other aspects to consider, but those would be two prime points<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Leaerjet @Bigbootyarce @ReiverHall @CNN A fair enough point, for sure. That was ~250 years ago. If another nation were to try and "take" the US in the present, it won't be a civilian with a commercially available semi-automatic firearm doing the defending. But that weapon sure as hell might be used to shoot up a school<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bigbootyarce @Leaerjet @ReiverHall @CNN How's that now? You're telling me a bolt-action rifle is a semi-automatic? A double action revolver is a semi-automatic? A breech-loading shotgun? Please, inform me...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Leaerjet @ReiverHall @CNN Those "arms" were flintlock pistols and muzzle-loading muskets. You can have as many of those as you like, sir! Civilians. Do. Not. Need. Semi-automatic. Weapons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey #America, why not ban semi-automatic, assault rifle-style guns for civilians? I'd like to hear an actual intelligent, fact-based reason why those kinds of guns need to be available to the average joe. #GunViolence #NRA #USA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JadeAlberts @Sportsnet @KrRutherford So those sports should certainly be included where warranted, but do they have to be at the exclusion of women's hockey? Personally, I'd have a problem with excluding a women's team sport while keeping the men's game, but that's another discussion altogethe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JadeAlberts @Sportsnet @KrRutherford Be that as it may, the other countries still have the right to play the game, and no one improves otherwise.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>It seems like a slap in the face to hockey fans to have a goal disallowed in a fucking #NHLAllStar game on a video replay offside call<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3 #NHL observations:  1. THIS is what we get instead of NHLers at #PyeongChang2018 ? Ugh. #NHLAllStar 2. Ron MacLean is a sharp, ruthless interviewer...love it. 3. Kills me to say it, but Gary Bettman is a smart motherf**ker in front of the camera.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>F**king brutal. No way that POS Brad Marchand should be a the #NHLAllStarGame #NHL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darekmoreau @AngryPensGnome That's kind of the point...a great Bortles game doesn't translate into beating a dynasty team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArchaeoJalapeno @darekmoreau did. Like, a bunch of times. 😒<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have to say it again, I hate the #NFL tradition of giving the trophy to the owner before the players. The guys that win it on the field should get it first, they are the ones that got the job done. #NFLPlayoffs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darekmoreau He played well. But when you're down by 4 late...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now we find out who #BlakeBortles really is. #AFCChampionshipGame #JAXvsNE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm a #Habs fan. A few days ago that call went against us, tonight, for us. I'll say it again, I hate that video review for offside. Please, PLEASE, #NHL for the sake of the game, have some common sense and get rid of that review<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxjacobsen If I had a dollar for every time I heard that...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxjacobsen Elvis Stojko's "martial-arts-Bruce Lee-style" routine was worth a watch! He's the scariest kind of ninja. The one with blades attached to his feet. Though, his effectiveness as an assassin is completely negated in tropical climates. #FigureSkating101<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dimitrie69 @TSNBobMcKenzie Of course. And everyone has to deal with it...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dimitrie69 @TSNBobMcKenzie It was clear as day when it was seen frame-by-frame on replay, and then by maybe, what, half an inch? How does that give the attacking team a competitive advantage nearly a minute later? The replay rule in that case is ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Plecky should have tried the ol' Darryl Sittler special on that SH chance. #Habs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>For fuck sake. That offside replay rule is ridiculous. How does it make any sense to go back nearly a minute of playing time to find a play that's offside by a fraction of an inch? How is that a competitive advantage??? #NHL #Habs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxjacobsen It's hard to believe, really, that in my 40s, this is the world. All of the advancements of the last 100 years, and this is where we are. I keep thinking our great-grandparents would be fucking appalled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxjacobsen @realDonaldTrump How very human that would be!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxjacobsen Yes. But you're applying the principles of behaviour that Americans have come to expect from a couple hundred years of presidential history. Pretty sure that algorithm can be placed on hold until at least 2020.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump So, white people. Got it. You racist POS.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryBearsOgre @AngryPensGnome @darekmoreau @gadus07 @AngrySensGnome @AngryHabsGnome @tweettie_J_bird His stick? Yeah, probably.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@aerynsunx @Schmides31 @BarDown Well, I was actually referring to your advocating for actions such as his. He's a kid, he'll learn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@keyserlol @Schmides31 @freefalling1912 @aerynsunx @BarDown Ahh yes, the classic excuse. Teams that play with speed and keep their feet moving tend to draw penalties, that's Hockey 101.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@freefalling1912 @aerynsunx @Schmides31 @BarDown I think in the context of the discussion, that much was implied, but yes, good sportsmanship isn't everyone's cup o' tea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Schmides31 @aerynsunx @BarDown In my experience, sportsmanship isn't everyone's cup o' tea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aerynsunx @Schmides31 @BarDown So all the other players that accepted their silver medals didn't want to win??? Fact is, they all wanted to win, but this kid handled the loss very poorly, and I'm sure he'll learn from it. Losing with class is all part of becoming a pro.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@surly74 @BarDown To this point in his career, I mean.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@surly74 @aerynsunx @BarDown Absolutely.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@b_anderson9 The point is that there's no shame in losing a one-game, winner-take-all final, especially when both teams played as well as they did last night.  But if you don't agree with that perspective, fine...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Re: Sweden's #WorldJuniors silver, I've seen a lot of people write that they'd rather "win" bronze than "lose" for silver. So, what you're saying is, you would never want to be in a position to win gold for fear of losing it? Hope you enjoy your existence in the middle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aerynsunx @BarDown Learning to lose with class is all part of the process for these guys on their road to the pros. Many get visibly upset of course, but how many NHL players throw a tantrum on the ice  when they lose a Cup final? None. Because they've all learned how to lose along the way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@b_anderson9 And quoting Will Ferrell's Ricky Bobby is some stroke of genius? Enough, thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@b_anderson9 Ha...ok champ. *you're last, btw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jschneider8166 @BarDown ...and there's also a rush of blood to the head in an 18 or 19 year old kid who's the captain of a team that he's grown up hearing about how they can't win in the medal round.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau @gadus07 @marcmackinnon4 @tweettie_J_bird Yep. Gold medal game buddy. Canada won. You are now up to date on sports.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KelseyAPye @HFXMooseheads Bad decision by the kid after losing what was probably the biggest game of his life. He'll learn a lot from that, and I'm glad he got it back.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarDown Bad choice by a young kid who just lost probably the biggest game of his life. I'm glad he got it back. He'll probably learn more from that than he would've from the whole tourney.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau @AngryPensGnome @gadus07 @marcmackinnon4 @tweettie_J_bird Well if they'd played 4 vs 5 all night, they might have won! 😛<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau @AngryPensGnome @gadus07 @marcmackinnon4 @tweettie_J_bird Swedes seemed to make a lot bad decisions that led to some PPs for Canada<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darekmoreau @AngryPensGnome @gadus07 @AngrySensGnome @marcmackinnon4 @tweettie_J_bird Man, that was one of the best games I've seen at this tourney in a while.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SinclairPrez @MeredithFrost @Kodak Unlit of course, but I came across this one in Quebec City in 2013 and had a similar thought.  https://t.co/xmAQ8gIFgt<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>There it is folks. Closing out 2017 with another #Trump record: The dumbest fucking tweet in the history of the presidency, possibly all of mankind.  https://t.co/Z3jWVlvI0s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@canhowie @theScoreNHL But, of course you're right to the point that it's about what the league sees. When I first saw this situation, it reminded me a bit of Lemieux's goal v. CZE at the 2002 Olympics...puck in glove, glove in net. Couldn't actually see the puck in that one though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@canhowie @theScoreNHL I think the league has access to any of the angles from tv cameras working a game, and potentially some angles that we as viewers don't see. I've heard that from broadcasters on a few occasions (which I would be a somewhat reliable spurce, I would think)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@canhowie @theScoreNHL I'm also not sure how league consistency comes into play here. They had the angle to prove it's over the line, so it's called a good goal. And I doubt there's ever been such an instance where the right call wasn't made...again, given the video goal judge has the appropriate angle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@canhowie @theScoreNHL Most likely? I'm not sure how much more "indisputable evidence" you can hope for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theScoreNHL Please, Robin Lehner, can I get your take on the flat earth, chemtrails and unicorns as well? Asking for a friend...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@canhowie @theScoreNHL Hmm, sure looks like it's over the line to me.  https://t.co/dYpPixFtu3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#NewProfilePic  https://t.co/ihdh6ihHLM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wouldn't rank #IIHF officials up there with #NHL guys, but as a general group, it is remarkable how often linesmen get those close, bang-bang calls at the blue line correct without the help of 6 different replay angles #WorldJuniors #TSNHockey<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MattFoulger @daldosis @TSN_Sports Agreed...again the IIHF has discovered a way to mystify us all!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daldosis @TSN_Sports Only possible explanation is that the ref called it a goal initially, with no conclusive evidence to overturn...can't see how that's possible however!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy shit. Got a gift there boys! #TeamCanada #WJHC2018<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Choskeyy7 @MatthewDuncanDJ @e77s68 @Cabbie @JJames18_ Ha...maybe a fair point but nothing to do with the Pats here...just a really sh*t rule.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MatthewDuncanDJ @e77s68 @Cabbie @JJames18_ By any sane manner of scrutiny, yes, but by the #NFL rulebook, it doesn't constitute a football move<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fnance14 @Cabbie @TheTruth_99 @JJames18_ Basically, yes. He would have been deemed to have had control at the time he was ruled down by contact...ridiculous rule.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@e77s68 @Cabbie @JJames18_ No. By the letter of the rule, James had not established himself as a runner, therefore he must control the ball through to the ground, which he did not. Absolutely the right call on an absolutely ridiculous rule.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cabbie @TeamJuJu @tonyromo @theDHB85 @JJames18_ @dharm32 @Patriots If the guy has control when he breaks the plane, it should be a TD. Could care less about the teams involved, but that's f'ing brutal<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@darekmoreau @AngryPensGnome If Floyd was impulsive and tried to brawl with Mac early, it could have happened. But you don't go 49-0 by brawling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @darekmoreau As much as I dislike Floyd, Saturday night was a clinic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @darekmoreau I like UFC, but like you I grew up with boxing. Unfortunately the boxing world is ridiculously uninteresting right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darekmoreau @AngryPensGnome Go back and watch Mac v. Jose Aldo, that's why he had a chance. But only chance was to catch Floyd early, which guys have tried for 20 yrs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @darekmoreau ...sure the extreme favorite won, but the guy was in there for 10 rounds. And it legitimately took Floyd 4 rds to figure it out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @darekmoreau I'm not sure you can say MMA lost. This is like the Patriots playing the SK Roughriders, and beating them on a late drive...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Who knows? He might have a bit of an injury...or just one of those goalie poltergeists...goalies are weird like that sometimes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Also doesn't hurt that Rinne is f**king dyin' out there! 8 goals on 36 shots...yikes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Well, 2 Ws in the books is halfway to a #StanleyCup any way you get 'em! And I don't expect the #Pens to play this poorly in the next two<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkForwardd That's looking at the bright side! #PMA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe the #Pens had the book on the #Preds all along. Hockey's version of the rope-a-dope has worked for two games now. @AngryPensGnome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Everybody in the league seems to do that these days...that and the slashing on the hands. Time to deal with it #NHL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome 12 shots, snoozed for almost 40 mins. I don't think #Pens will do that very often in the #StanleyCup  final...got the W anyway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Geeze. Rinne really isn't good on his short side. #NHL #StanleyCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy christ, am I ever tired of reading tweets, posts, etc with people complaining about referees/calls in the #NHL playoffs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jessespagnuolo9 @theScore Sure is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlueMetropolis @theScore Well, since you used the word literally...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theScore Awww, cupcake. Alright everybody, no pitches over 80 mph to Joshy boy, k? #SuperSoftBaseball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like that Crosby took the Prince of Wales trophy...you won it, take it. Doesn't mean you don't want the Stanley Cup. #NHL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That team handshake. Guy who got his finger exploded shakes the hand of the guy that did it, wishing him luck in the finals. #NHL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cuttingejs Personally I think they've done a decent job tonight, but either way, agreed, been 50/50 pretty much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Someone show these fans at the rink in PIT a decent replay...puck has to go IN the net folks. On the net = no goal. #HockeyRules<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I see #Sens fans saying refs are calling it for #Pens in OT, Pens fans vice versa. It's playoff OT hockey boys, get over it. #NHL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cjzero Never calling that in OT with the puck 85 feet away from the 6th skater.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Sens pressing early. Smart. If #Pens get rhythm going, it's trouble for OTT #SensVsPens #NHL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome I got #87 for the #Pens. Anderson for the #Sens...why not? Only way this game gets any weirder/better for him. #NHL #SensVsPens<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Game 7 OT reminds me of playing pond hockey as a kid. Almost supper time, hands/feet frozen, "next goal wins". #NHL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is either one of the greatest bad games, or worst great games by a goalie in the playoffs. #AdventuresInGoaltending #SensVsPens<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FriedgeHNIC As he should. Phaneuf penalty was legit, but ref could have easily taken Kessel too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Oh Kessel. THAT was a dive. Penalty against Phaneuf was legit, but the Russian judge gives Kessel a 10!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome He's really trying to screw it up...but he's playing too well. #HotKeeper<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Adventures in Goaltending 2: Anderson's Journey Behind the Net #NHL #SensVsPens<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Pens D look like they aren't expecting #Sens to press on offence...Sullivan should kick the shit out of a garbage can in the intermission<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Well deservedly so far in this one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Speed and puck possession kills. #Pens D are not on tonight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Oh man, that's the #Pens getting away with one there...easy interference missed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brutal play by #Sens D at one end on the #Pens goal, great play by Stone to stay onside at the other for a response. #KeepUpThePace<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@darekmoreau @AngrySensGnome @labelle_kyle @PxPOttawa Just weird that a Canadian arena seating less than 19k isn't selling out, regardless of the logistics of getting there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darekmoreau @AngrySensGnome @labelle_kyle @PxPOttawa I'm with Moreau there, I'd also like to see Sens win. I'm not sure why you're ripping Habs fans for wondering what's up in OTT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Daley did what I'd want my guy to do by going after that puck no doubt...weak effort by Karlsson to clear Daley I thought<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome 2/2...and the shove on Anderson prevents him from being in position to make the save.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Sorry buddy, but this to me is a clear-cut a case of goalie interference. Refs got it right. Daley's in the crease... 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HermannHigh Liam Gallagher doesn't follow anyone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Looked like he lost sight of the puck, so he did the old snow angel hoping the ref lost sight too...smart play really...got lucky<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Goalies aren't D-linemen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Killer goal for #OTT to give up there. Just had a call go your way and can't make it count. #NHL #pitvsott<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Ya can't push the keeper into the net, boys!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Jesus H. Christ, Don Cherry...with that jacket, I was expecting you to have Ron MacLean's disembodied head on the desk! #NHL #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome That's pretty much exactly what it is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome More to my point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome That's what you do when you're the captain and haven't done anything else in the series<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Nice! Pub's cleared out so I have the end of this one on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's ALIVE!!!! #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Jesus. Brutal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Letting them play is one thing, but some shit is a penalty anytime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That might have just saved the whole fucking season #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Seems to be a theme. #Habs Shaw got cross-checked in the fucking ear in front of the net a few minutes ago, no call.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How the fuck is there no penalty there??!?! Shaw is cross-checked, Galchenyuk gets bull-dogged...#wtf #NHL #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In case you were wondering: Hockey 101. D-men should not be sprawling on the ice 125 ft from your own net.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great start. Puck in the net, Lundqvist is pissed. Win-win. #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darekmoreau It's pretty frustrating to watch when Price puts in a game like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darekmoreau He made some good saves sure, but the Habs weren't creating anything...like I said, same old team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Same #Habs team that couldn't buy a goal in the playoffs 2 years ago. Loading up on D-men/size at the trade deadline, no help<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @argusace Good strategy. Wouldn't think they'd need that advice at this level<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moss! #Royals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hoping this isn't the end for @Anthony_Rumble but if so, one of my fav fighters...go do what you want to do man, you earned it #ufc210<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brutal finish to a good fight. I like that #Mousasi didn't let his people celebrate in the octagon. #ufc210<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And another dislodged net on scoring play! I'm thinking good goal for WSH there. #WSHvsBOS #NHL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pure judgement call regarding the integrity of the scoring area there. Think they got that one right for good goal for BOS. #WSHvsBOS #NHL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @darekmoreau @AngrySensGnome Yup. And we'll win that fucker too!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darekmoreau @AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome My point was that I know there is, and has been, quite a bit in the men's game, unsure of that contribution on the women's side<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome @darekmoreau On the men's side there's been quite a bit in GER, SWI<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome @darekmoreau I'd be curious to know how much Canadian involvement there is in the women's hockey programs in SWE, FIN, GER etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome @darekmoreau True. But the other teams won't get better if they aren't playing CAN/USA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @darekmoreau @AngrySensGnome Just the facts, ma'am<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @darekmoreau @AngrySensGnome Not rare at all...US has won 8 of the last 9 world championships<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Was going to ask you about that guy, not familiar with him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whoa. Sweet grab #LoCain #LoCatch #Royals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theScore Read: "Conor, do your thing and then, pretty please, with a cherry on top, come back to make more money for me!"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Goddamn. Song to describe #Royals season so far: "Walk" by #FooFighters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hockeynight Annnnnddd who is Chris Pronger's employer? Way to toe the line there buddy. #NHL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got a day to shake that off anyway...restart on Wednesday! #Royals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome When the hell did I start playing 3rd base for the Royals???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Come on man, that 6 inch vertical was impressive. #Royals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey #NHL , Go f**k yourself, and all 30 of your money-grubbing owners.  Sincerely,  Hockey fans that love best-on-best for Olympic gold<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Super Bowl halftime show was pretty wild down here!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Little glimpse into the pub for you! Still under construction, open for business though.  https://t.co/wAGeIp0H9p<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome There wasn't when I renewed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome I better be in the game, #MLBTV ain't cheap up here!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Cheers buddy! Watching from #JenkinsPub a.k.a. my basement. At least it got above freezing temp in #NovaScotia today! #Royals #OpeningDay  https://t.co/PntshU0pYy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The worst. @TSN_Sports @TSNHockey  https://t.co/vRLcetLRFU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxjacobsen Interesting to see how far down the rabbit hole they'll go!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxjacobsen Might they sacrifice him in an effort to regain some kind of trust? Not that my political strategy is ANYTHING to be considered! :p<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxjacobsen Gotta ask yourself, how can he really? 70(?) days in and it's been, to quote Trump himself, a "complete disaster".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Real_ESPNLeBrun Emelin is no saint, not as bad as Thornton makes him out to be, but he's right on the accountability point, and it's the #NHL own fault. 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sharknado. They said it could happen. #Sharkpocalypse  https://t.co/HopGfhTrPK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@farmer3310 @CTVNews Obviously it's a situation of maximum caution maybe even overkill, but the fines are 100% avoidable for drivers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@farmer3310 @CTVNews Would you prefer kids got hit as justification??? Easy fix, don't speed in school zones.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theScore But, you know, later...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Hey! Can a Canadian #Royals fan get one to help fend off Blue Jays fans north of the border??? #CapsOn #OpeningDay  https://t.co/QCsuEsPZtq<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@Real_ESPNLeBrun @espn This is one time that I'm in complete agreement with #IIHF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau @gadus07 @BelleyRenald 3-0 vs NYR this season so there won't be any panic if that's the way it shakes out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau @gadus07 @BelleyRenald You get the breaks you make.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau @gadus07 @BelleyRenald Not that it really matters. Home ice for 2 rds is the only upside to winning the Atl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice little tantrum there for #OTT Bobby Ryan. #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darekmoreau @AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome I dunno, I'm leaning towards 9-9...#FinalRound<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darekmoreau Christ Moreau, are you trying to enrage the @AngryPensGnome ???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @darekmoreau It's why I hate NBA ball and love college ball<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Nah, the exploded finger is evidence enough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernmostPen @BryanWilley78 And players don't put themselves in a position to be purposefully injured!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernmostPen @BryanWilley78 Problem with the logic there is the idea that someone would do that as it offers no competitive advantage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernmostPen There are numerous instances where slashes or attempted slashes warrant supplemental discipline without causjng injury<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernmostPen 2/2 ...that are deemed excessive most of the time with no necessary supplemental discipline<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernmostPen I didn't say you'd never suspend for a slash without injury, the point was that refs give penalties for slashes.... 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BryanWilley78 @SouthernmostPen Absolutely! And there are no NHL standards from a protective standpoint.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernmostPen Circumstances that aggravate the situation can, as in this case, be the severity of an injury.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernmostPen 3/3 ...unless it's an aggravated instance, which IMO, this was. And as I've stated, I'm no Crosby hater<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernmostPen 2/3 What you describe is an ultra-exagerration, obviously you aren't suspending guys for stick checks, even slashes...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernmostPen There's a difference between stick checking and slashing. Granted it's a grey line sometimes, but they are not the same 1/3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernmostPen And I'll say it again, slashing hard enough to nearly take a finger off is not innocuous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernmostPen It's not the outcome alone, has to include the act and intent, but to ignore the injury it is the obtuse strategy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernmostPen My point was that the injury does matter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Shit man, that's one thing we can agree on! 1st was a little tense, but off the chart after halftime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Clearly there was no intent on Crosby's part, but if you chop a guy that hard, and don't have control of your stick...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome I agree with the first part consistency is non-existent. But IMO, the act, injury and intent all have to be considered.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome It plays a pretty big part, yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernmostPen So you'd ignore the outcome in all cases? Do you think Steve Moore or Donald Brashear would agree?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernmostPen ...but it did result in a serious injury, so yes, in this case, the injury should be a consideration<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernmostPen @BryanWilley78 Sheer pressure can do that. Same as pressure cuts goalies can get after a shot to the mask<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernmostPen Hey man, some of us can enjoy multiple sports...now go find some shade, I think the heat's getting to you. Cheers!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SouthernmostPen Sorry bud, if you're referring to me with that comment, you're sorely mistaken.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2/2 That chop happens a lot, but if you aren't in control of your stick, and a guy nearly loses a finger the #NHL has to make a statement<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm no hater, but Crosby should get two games for that slash. I have no issue with the refs missing a call, but league review is a must. 1/2  https://t.co/8eM9oRtgoL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@BryanWilley78 @TSN_Sports That stick-on-stick play happens a lot, but when you nearly take a guys finger off, the league should intervene<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkForwardd @AirCanada 2/2 ...my name isn't #MerriamWebster, but I'm pretty f**king sure that's the very definition of reservation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@MarkForwardd @AirCanada Been there. Had the gate agent at #YYZ tell me that buying a reservation doesn't guarantee you a seat... 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Q104Halifax @CBCNews Feel bad for the guy but ask yourself, if you were driving behind him, would you think, "huh, funky surname!"? No.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxjacobsen WTF? Certainly doesn't fit the usual profile, does it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JJSA1985 @Sportsnet @Steve_Dangle I'd like to see that but I'm skeptical. Either way, it's an NHL-engineered tourney designed to make money<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JJSA1985 @Sportsnet @Steve_Dangle Disagree 100%. WC 2016 and it's gimmick teams is not the Olympic experience. Willing to bet players agree<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Humphery1950 @theScore WC as it was in '16 is a gimmick, nothing more. Pacioretty is 100% right, the players want to be at the Olympics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Humphery1950 @theScore Fully disagree. There is no valid comparison here. The level of competition in Olympic hockey is light years beyond<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Blasting a 100 mph clapper, or deking the keeper out of his pants, all the same to me. Don't worry man, Sid's rep is intact<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome My wife calls it sportsing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Nah man! Sometimes the shooter just beats you, that's sports! But when the puck is going 40 mph or it goes "through you"...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Howard's reaction would suggest so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome @AngryBearsOgre Highlight reel for sure, but gotta agree with @darekmoreau, weak effort by the goalie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Basketball fights, among the most awkward things to see. To quote the Coach, "IT'S F**KING EMBARRASSING!!!" @MarkForwardd @LetterkennyProb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lehkonen had the right idea on the tying goal. Shoot the puck on net, hard as you freakin' can...you could feel that on coming! #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@Sportsnet Over-the-hill Premier Leaguers in #MLS reminds me of old, tired lions at the zoo. Fool you into paying the price of admission.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Sportsnet @CanadiensMTL @BlueJacketsNHL I'd love to know why that was called off...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Markov shows off his old man strength! #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, for all you assholes that always say the Habs get the calls...love to know why that wasn't a goal. #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That has to be a good goal. #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A few gutsy wins lately but Bergevin needs to pull some strings for scoring help. Enough with the depth D-men. #GoHabsGo #NHLTradeDeadline<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>In retrospect, #WarrenBeatty 's "I need an adult" face was priceless. #Oscars<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Weird stuff, but you're dead on there. Used to be that chemistry was a given even if the team lacked skill/depth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Oh yeah, that was meant as a compliment to him...too many passengers on this team IMO<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SNstats Uh, the "1" in that stat line is the important number when the question is "What is your elimination game record in the last year?"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok ref, put the whistle away for a while so they can play some hockey! #NHL #PITvsMTL #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sportsnet @CanadiensMTL This is starting to make me wonder...if he hadn't trained for/played in the WC, I could buy 3 games for the flu...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@timandsid ...Are you going to be saying  "the Edmonton football club" when the Eskys next visit the #Argos #Hypocrisy 2/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@timandsid And saying "the Cleveland baseball club" isn't a shot? ...1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>.@CBCToronto No problem with the push to rid pro sports of these names but would it be happening now if the #BlueJays were up in the series?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theScore Wow, what a f**king joke! Stop whining about the umpires and not getting pitches you want, and get the bat off your shoulder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome You need to start watching baseball or #CFL football man...burn off some of that energy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Jesus b'y, I know the Sens haven't won much lately, but save a bit for the stretch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Twitter guide to #BlueJays fan tweets: "They're amazing!" = Jays win. "The umpire sucked"/"MLB doesn't want us to win" = Jays loss.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timandsid @Sportsnet When a guy with zero #NHL experience scores 4, and the rest of the team does nothing... #PlanTheParade<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TSN_Sports @AngryPensGnome Won everything, hang 'em up Sid. Tough to step away but it might save his life. Early start in coaching?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whoa. That called 3rd strike on Choo. #BlueJays fans, you don't get to complain about calls going against you for the rest of this series!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dutchysc Well, the fans have a history now don't they?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theScore It was only a matter of time. #BushLeague<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Annnnd there it is. That's why I hate the whole sports attitude in #Toronto #BlueJays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>IMO the greatest trophy in sports is the Stanley Cup. And the World Cup trophy looks like a vase they stole from the hotel lobby #WCH2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not exactly Gretzky-Lemieux in '87, but we'll take it! #WCH2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TSN_Sports More importantly though, how are they going to blame that on the umpire and/or Roughned Odor???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theScore ...injured. You left that word out of the quote buddy. "Chicago just got used to seeing me injured"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theScore Don't the Caps use a "premature" playoff exit as motivation every year? #NHL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So if you're not from the #Halifax area, you're not in the goal column for #TeamCanada tonight #WCH2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome I realize a lot of people don't like him, but he's the best on the planet...indisputable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a chance for PK Weber!  @AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau @gadus07 @AngryHabsGnome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who would have guessed that #USA and #Finland would finish a combined 0-6 at the #WCH2016 ? The Fins looked absolutely dreadful.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Done as soon as Henrik committed to the poke check. You're not poke checking an NHL-caliber scorer when he's standing still #WCH2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>MacKinnon! Holy shit...left Lundqvist for dead! #WCH2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@susinsky @globeandmail Better than advertising on the uniforms...European club teams look atrocious covered head to toe in corp logos<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McD_Canada Was told by cashier that is was because BL was a corporate location vs franchise in Bedford. Difference of 29 cents? Really? 2/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McD_Canada Halifax, NS area: $2.00 for a large coffee at Bedford McD., $2.29 for the same at the Bayers Lake location. 1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @darekmoreau Well, that's another issue!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @darekmoreau Sure, my point though, is being so set on beating a single team in a short format tourney is a poor strategy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Goddamn. Kessel just roasted the whole outfit with that one. #WCH2016  https://t.co/jcWekFfmi3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is where #TeamCanada needs to stay out of the bullsh*t #WCH2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darekmoreau @AngryPensGnome They lost this as soon as they got into the "building a team to beat Canada" thinking<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The ultimate insult to a goalie is when #DonCherry breaks out the Hardy Astrom reference. #Grapes #WCH2016<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome @AngryHabsGnome Well, umm...I do. Wasn't yesterday granted...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryHabsGnome From Montreal I believe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryHabsGnome @AngryPensGnome Not sure #2 will count, but great bounce back for #TeamCanada<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@darekmoreau @AngryHabsGnome @AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome No it doesn't, still need scoring but without it responsible D corps is better<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darekmoreau @AngryHabsGnome @AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome So what should the short term vision be? Tank and try to be Edmonton...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darekmoreau @AngryHabsGnome @AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome Right, PK who's a liability in his own end on a team that can't afford it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darekmoreau @AngryHabsGnome @AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome If you can't score, you want blue chip D guys who aren't a liability i.e. Weber<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CallumFraser18 @AngrySensGnome Healy out? Please, please let this be true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau @AngryHabsGnome @AngryPensGnome Still need some damned scoring up front!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau @AngryHabsGnome @AngryPensGnome ...and when your game is keeping the puck out of your net, that's not good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau @AngryHabsGnome @AngryPensGnome I don't have a huge problem with it...PK has a habit of making bad decisions...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timandsid PK is a good, young player but even with Price in goal, the margin for error on D is too small for #MTL and PK is error prone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Blown away by news of Subban/Weber swap. But. I think this is a great deal for #Habs .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darekmoreau @gadus07 Still probably beat #ENG on penalties.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Top in Group B! Brilliant job, interested to see who's up in the KO stage! #WAL #EURO2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bale!!!!!!!! 3-for-3 at #EURO2016 Unbelievable showing tonight! #WAL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GarethBale is absolutely flying out there tonight! #WAL #EURO2016 @jennymacadoo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Taylor!!!!!!! 2-0 #WAL Opening #RUS up like a can of caviar! #EURO2016 @jennymacadoo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ramsey!!!!!! Great start lads! #WAL #EURO2016 @jennymacadoo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We've lured #Bel into a sense of security at 3-0 up...3 mins of stoppage time, now we strike! #irl #EURO2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn #KMO , that was a bomb! I'd say save some of that for the close ones but whatever gets the mojo back baby! #Royals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome This is a great shot!  https://t.co/zsqlLKrguX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatriciaMar5 @theScore Sorry, I don't drink the Greg Zaun kool-aid!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatriciaMar5 @theScore You're free to disagree, but the video doesn't lie! Peace ✌<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatriciaMar5 @theScore ...which was on the 3rd base side of the field, so he had to come back the other way to Odor...got put in his place<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatriciaMar5 @theScore Defence? Ha! He's the one who got up into Odor's face when he should have just continued on to the dugout...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PatriciaMar5 @theScore The guy barely began his slide before he got to the bag, ergo, brutally late slide. #WatchTheVideo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theScore Head up lad, take three points from #Rus  and we're golden! #WAL #EURO2016 #GarethBale<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theScore Jays fans forget that it was Bautista's brutally late slide that started the brawl, not the bat flip. And I don't even like Odor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too much sitting back and defending. #WAL #EURO2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#GarethBale !!! In-f**king-credible!!! #WAL #Euro2016<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BarDown Las Vegas Black Aces...that'd be a great hockey name tying Vegas to the hardest working guys in hockey!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Well, he made contact. Step 1.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theoldtriangle Any chance you'll be open for Wales v. England on Thursday morning? #WAL #EURO2016<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Got him #Royals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NFL twitter account hacked today, hoax re: death of Goodell. Must have been Belicheck/Brady. @darekmoreau<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sportsnet No chance to get Dyson at first, trying to pull up. #Fail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bloody hell. #Royals pitch, crack of bat, ball in outfield seats. Lather, rinse, repeat. #TightenItUpBoys<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never been a Phil Kessel fan, but his compete level has a new gear in the #StanleyCupFinal #NHL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chris Young: Enough. Home. Runs. #Royals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Feel bad for Murray there, as a goalie, he had pretty much everything covered. That shit squeaks through sometimes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Sports tonight with Black Rum Jenkins: #Pens look good. #Royals not so much. #ExpertOpinion<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Gandalf Thornton will be a challenge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Think he's out after playing a post-hit shift.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Marleau could get a game for that. Pretty much the definition of first point of contact from the angles I saw.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @ESPNStatsInfo Great weekend of typical #Royals brand baseball. Thankfully we can get #MLBTV in Canada!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@astounding202 @SillyCanadian Jen said you guys have fitbit competitions...try watching the Royals!  https://t.co/i1V9dU9v6V<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Incredible come back! #Royals #NeverQuit  https://t.co/U3RYD1ax44<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is why you never f**king stop playing! #Royals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fr0styTwoPoint0 @SportsCentre Ha! That is an excellent analysis and come back, sir. Bravo! Maybe #TSN is accepting job applications?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Fr0styTwoPoint0 @SportsCentre Average margin of victory for CLE was over 28 pts (19 was the closest game). That's not due to officiating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy to see the @Raptors showing respect for their opponent tonight. That's been sorely lacking in Toronto sports teams lately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sportsnet @budcanada Gotta agree with him, health risks aside, I don't think anyone can jump in at the level they need to be at for a CF G7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And that's just got to be demoralizing for #TBLightning .Great response from the #Pens #StanleyCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@affabletoaster Though I was referring to other drivers, your point is also valid!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@affabletoaster Must be a secret full moon today. Picked Jen up today and we uttered the phrase "WTF is up with people???" numerous times!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darekmoreau @AngryPensGnome Good, it's working. ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @theScore And Captain Obvious manages a team with a nucleus of unlikable players. Go figure...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I really don't want to see #TBLightning beat #Pens in this series, but this offside replay thing is ridiculous. #NHL #StanleyCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This will be in the history books as #Putin taking the ice in Moscow and single-handedly defeating #TeamCanada to reclaim the gold medal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. Finns were easily the best team at #IIHFWorlds right up until today's puck drop v. #TeamCanada What a game plan CAN came with. #Gold<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Geeze, how dominant have #TeamCanada been in the Finns zone in this game? Reward will come. #StrongSmartHockey #IIHFWorlds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When are they going to put an end to this garbage???  https://t.co/wVVWJSrUOb<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PensInitiative @AngryPensGnome Milbury is a joke and a wannabe Don Cherry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@literateowl @CBCNews How's it a sucker punch when two guys are aggressively standing toe-to-toe? Bautista played chicken with Odor and lost<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Salvy! Frosty throw to second. @SalvadorPerez15 #WhyBotherRunning #Royals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gerrydee Spoken like a true Toronto sports fan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At a Toronto bar, Raps Gm7 on most tvs, #Jays on a couple. Was about the only one to see Odor clock #Bautista in real time. #TheLittleThings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jacobbradshaw09 @TSN_Sports Pretty sure you didn't win dude. #Royals #Crowned  https://t.co/i5nBFW83BD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry Jose #Bautista , that bat flip is going to haunt you forever vs. the Rangers. #SolidRightToTheChin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ashleyjmorton @mlscote Interesting move!  https://t.co/ayfARoGOfg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thi is going to be a game now @AngryPensGnome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn. Huge goal for the #Pens there. Needed to break that goose egg. #TBLvsPIT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sportsnet @budcanada Absolutely right. Guys have to be aware of where they are on the ice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can't describe how hard it is to find the #Royals on tv in #Toronto. What did we ever do to you??? #EliminatedYou @AngryPensGnome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At a Toronto bar #Royals v NYY on tv. Guys next to me pissed the ex. innings #Jays game isn't on. Wish I had my KC hat on! @AngryPensGnome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @CBC @TSN @nbc But hey, at least you are spared George Strombolopolis and Hipster Night in Canada<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @CBC @TSN @nbc Milbury tries so hard to be Don Cherry<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big step on the road to Premier League survival today! Must have 3 points from Villa! #NUFC #HowayTheLads<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is Barry Trotz an absolute moron? That hit by #Orpik was exactly what the league is trying to get rid of and he got what he deserves. #NHL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TonyReali Incredible. Cinderella playoff teams in NA leagues are great, but #LCFC had to endure 38 games to take the title! #5000to1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy shit!!! Karl Darlow may have just written himself into #NUFC lore with that penalty save! #HowayTheLads<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ian_mendes @TSN_Sports Fine stat but I'm pretty sure a pocket full of Stanley Cup rings trumps that .025 difference between Blake and Boud<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looks like a great design. #NHL may have actually gotten this right.   https://t.co/47n426uKgv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bradtaft @CraigCustance @AndiPetrillo Not likely. Looks like it's set into the inside edge of the bar to prevent that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nate_bukaty @AngryPensGnome On behalf of my fellow Canadians, I'm really, really sorry you have to go through this...stay strong KC!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3 games into the #MLB season, #BlueJays fans are already crying conspiracy! Unless they go 161-1, it's going to be a long season of whining.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBCMaritimeNoon @CBCNews Absolutely. Far too much fear mongering among opponents regarding a product that is perfectly safe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darekmoreau @gadus07 @AngryPensGnome I could care less about who won that game really...was a good one though!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tisshe @TheWalkingDead Personally, I think the writers have taken a lot of liberties with fan loyalty lately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tisshe And then a 10 minute soliloquy by Negan leading up to...nothing. Disappointing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tisshe I get what they were going for in that they really had no choice where they ended up. But 80 minutes of it?...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Say it out loud people: "Kris Jenkins hits a buzzer-beating 3-pointer to win the #NationalChampionship " @AngryPensGnome @gadus07<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TitanLukas @Flatlander87 @SportsCentre 2/2...around the net and open up other areas for the skill guys. It's pretty basic hockey stuff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TitanLukas @Flatlander87 @SportsCentre 1/2 Easy there dude, I'm a fan of the team. All I'm saying is they need size to create traffic...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TitanLukas @Flatlander87 @SportsCentre Are any of those prospects going to contribute physical presence that has been non-existant?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SportsCentre What a waste of talent this guy is. Been saying it for years. Curious as to when the Leafs realize it and give up on him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanadiensMTL Why not give the guy a real shot? Not a charity game. This toilet bowl of a season could have used some grit and heart<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SportsCentre Not like this season can go any further down the toilet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SportsCentre Why are they constantly toying with this guy's career? Give him the last few games so he can show (or not show) his stuff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So we waited an hour and a fucking half for that. @TheWalkingDead #TWDFinale Could have been watching the #Royals<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Walk it off kid. #WalkingDead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome I think he'll be decent in Ottawa if they don't try to anoint him as a savior the way the leafs did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So I was watching the #NHLAllStar game, and a hockey game broke out! #GreatGame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome #JonScott has to be the frontrunner for MVP right now #NHLAllStar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a save by Gibson! #NHLAllStar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @NHL @IceCapsAHL @AngryPensGnome What harm could it do? Bit of grit in the lineup might help<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @NHL @IceCapsAHL @AngryPensGnome Goal. Hit. Defensive gaffe. Pretend fight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @NHL @IceCapsAHL @AngryPensGnome #JohnScott single-handedly makes the #NHLAllStar game fun again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @NHL @IceCapsAHL @AngryPensGnome Yeah, for sure! Not a fan of Glenn Healy shit talking his goal right after though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm 0% a fan of 3v3 in real #NHL games, but this is a great format for the #NHLAllStar game @AngryPensGnome @rystanman @darekmoreau @gadus07<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Not sure I'm on board with #Habs fans calling for a coaching change, but methinks Michel Therrien will not last the week.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Hard to say with Drouin. He might do better developing on a non-contender. In low pressure market, CMB, BUF, ANA maybe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome I'm not sold on him as a top 6 NHL forward...great junior player for @HFXMooseheads but there's something lacking<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>That's on you Virtanen. #GoCanadaGo #HereWeGo #WJC2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow...Virtanen...absolutely stupid. This kid needs to sit on the bench for the rest of this. Nothing but a liability. #GoCanadaGo<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>No doubt about that one! #GoCanadaGo #WJC2016<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That puck is probably in, but there's no angle that will prove it. #KeepItGoing #GoCanadaGo #WJC2016<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Not sure if they've given up on this due to the standings or what<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome They play with no energy or sense of urgency that I can see<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#TeamCanada showing their lack of experience, maturity and discipline here...Coach Lowry needs to channel Bob Knight here! @AngrySensGnome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This video review for goalie interference has turned into some truly ridiculous crap. What happened to real hockey? #NHL<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Davis. Let's finish this. #TakeTheCrown #Royals #WorldSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unreal. #TakeTheCrown #Royals #WorldSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome You got it baby!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No way Murphy was doubling up Orlando, but wow. #TakeTheCrown #Royals #WorldSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow, Colon! Good job young man! #TakeTheCrown #Royals #WorldSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome I'm with you. All the speed on third, Colon batting, go for it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's put another one on the board, make the Mets chase this #TakeTheCrown #Royals #WorldSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hosmer...insane play to tie it...just crazy. #TakeTheCrown #Royals #WorldSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's one. #TakeTheCrown #Royals #WorldSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alright boys, last chance #TakeTheCrown #Royals #WorldSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome Yeah man, ready to rock here! #Royals #TakeTheCrown #WorldSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Looks like your boy has gone over to the dark side.    https://t.co/30cySONJjo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryBearsOgre @AngryPensGnome I'm not seeing this right now and I'm fucking dying<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome If only the hosts had a tv!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome I'm going to be the jerk at the party looking at the score on his phone every 5 minutes! #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Looking for a much more solid effort all around tonight...not sure how much of the game I'm going to see though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Morales, come on man. #Royals #TakeTheCrown #WorldSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Looking like a long night here! #Royals #TakeTheCrown #WorldSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or, blow a 3-0 lead...yeah, that one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, apparently the #Habs are going to avenge their first loss of the season by pounding the #Oilers #NHL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jtmacdou On the Foos site, counting down. To what? No one knows.  New album, Dave's cast off, Sonic Highways 2?  https://t.co/gzyHDxoY9x<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cueto, CG! Fine performance sir. #Royals #TakeTheCrown #WorldSeries @AngryPensGnome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On fire boys! #Royals #TakeTheCrown #WorldSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @katemwilke @jtmacdou Jen is currently in a similar pose...minus the KC blanket!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Cueto seems like he needs to survive 3 innings before he can get into the groove. Been pretty sharp since giving up the run<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome ...strike zone was ridiculous for a while there, I'll agree on that for sure!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Right on. Think that call at first was a good one, worth a review, but they looked to get it right...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Ha, what are you angry about?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great inning, need a shutdown from Cueto here! #Royals #TakeTheCrown #WorldSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hos! #Royals #TakeTheCrown #WorldSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Ready for more? #Royals #TakeTheCrown #WorldSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxjacobsen Bingo.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxjacobsen ...a number of sentinel or index fisheries, and it's been a "legal" by-catch of all sorts of fisheries for other species<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxjacobsen I'm not sure what sort of fishing activity is going on right now honestly. But since the moratorium started, there have been...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxjacobsen ...rather than staying the course and allowing the stock to gain the traction George Rose was talking about<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxjacobsen Those kinds of reports have come out before. The reaction is to increase fishing activity to satisfy fishermen...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBCNL @jaxjacobsen It hasn't been allowed the opportunity to gain traction for the last 23 years, why should we think that will change?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#Royals come from behind again! There's a Ron Jeremy joke in there somewhere, but I'm too tired to think of it. #TakeTheCrown #WorldSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Yeah! Man, that game was all over the place...crazy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hos! #Redemption #WorldSeries #Royals #TakeTheCrown @AngryPensGnome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Yeah man! 2:05am here in Halifax. My wife will be getting up for work in an hour.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeParros @CanadiensMTL 18 points in the bank boys!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear work,  Sorry for being a zombie tomorrow. Game 1 is a marathon.  #WorldSeries #Royals #TakeTheCrown  Cheers,  Cris<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go get it. #Royals #TakeTheCrown #WorldSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Unusual game that way for sure<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Damn, that was a quick inning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Shit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Switched onto the Zobrist HR t-shirt...let's do it #Royals #TakeTheCrown @AngryPensGnome  https://t.co/K0lcsB9UdA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Is anybody happier than Hos right now? Teammates got you man!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Not yet baby! #AlexGordon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alright boys, need some magic here. #Royals #TakeTheCrown #WorldSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This shift isn't working Ned. #Royals #TakeTheCrown #WorldSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Yep...a lot of ball left to go yet. Key defensive inning coming up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanadiensMTL Pernell Karl for the #1stHabsGoal #1erButCH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Inside-the-park HR kick off for the #Royals. Unbelievable! #TakeTheCrown #WorldSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alcides. Escobar. Holy. Shit. #Royals #TakeTheCrown #WorldSeries @AngryPensGnome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome I hear ya. Hoping for a strong start tonight, put the pressure on early to get the crowd going<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Long wait for Tuesday!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Royals We have one from eastern Canada! #Halifax #Royals #TakeTheCrown  https://t.co/6gjrmd0tPf<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@russellmartin55 talking on @Sportsnet, this ball player sounds like a hell of a guy. Bring it back next season #BlueJays. #Royals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EastlinkMattB Excellent turnaround to the season. They have to keep that core together, need a bullpen though. #HatTip #Royals #BlueJays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Eastern Canada representin' #Royals #TakeTheCrown  https://t.co/kUny2DuN3c<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wade Davis...time is not a factor! #WorldSeries #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here we go..again. #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So Topeka farted, now we need the tarp. #BurritoNightInTopeka #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome we're still in command here...no one said it'd be easy baby. #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @MichelleDumoul1 Yeah, Herrera was rolling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rios...on fire against his old team! #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tweettie_J_bird @AngryPensGnome Hey man, don't hate the player...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EastlinkMattB You mean that HR. #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moose, again! #Beauty #Royals #TakeTheCrown @AngryPensGnome @MichelleDumoul1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Moose! #Royals #TakeTheCrown @AngryPensGnome @MichelleDumoul1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Last time I wore this shirt it was at the Rogers Center. Zobrist hit two HRs. @AngryPensGnome #Royals #TakeTheCrown  https://t.co/RLZ7fyiE1o<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Opening hit was good. Yordy looks focused now. #Royals #TakeTheCrown @AngryPensGnome @MichelleDumoul1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBCNews #FallApart #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>New recruit! @AngryPensGnome @MichelleDumoul1 #Royals #TakeTheCrown  https://t.co/mMPbrEcINM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's give the folks at the K what they came to see tonight! @MichelleDumoul1 #Royals #TakeTheCrown @AngryPensGnome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sportsnet Habs should be in on this. We need this kind of player up front. Not sure how much they'd want to give up for him though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, so we finish it at the K! #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still no quit. #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome I had a weird feeling about this game all day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well #BlueJays fans, I hope we don't hear you whining about balls/strikes going forward @BlueJays #Royals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Out of the jam nicely...go get one now boys! #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Better to be up buddy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nasty breaking ball to end it. Great win, one more for the AL! #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn, Pennington has some movement on his stuff!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FriedgeHNIC Please give this guy a ground ball, don't really want to embarrass this dude #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Guy likes the Rogers Center...saw him homer from both sides of the plate there in August<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Told my buddy Colin (Jays fan) last night that when the knuckleball goes bad, it goes BAD.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Cool man, hope I didn't sneak any spoilers in there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Zobrist...hustle. #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome That's some decent insurance right there! #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Smart move by Ned #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great punch back inning for Young #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At least wait for the call you f**king douchebags. #Royals #TakeTheCrown #ZeroClassBlueJays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#CreditWhereCreditIsDue<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn slick move there Hendricks. #Royals#TakeTheCrown #BlueJays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's a start! #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good stuff Volquez...challenge accepted! @AngryPensGnome  #Royals#TakeTheCrown  https://t.co/WekdhFEb66<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mapletml24 ...and Tulo's been arguing that stuff the whole playoffs. You know the officials notice that stuff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mapletml24 By itself, of course not, but you can't keep arguing with these umps...the Jays should be smarter than that...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonathanpaty3 @mapletml24 Ha! Traitor, over a baseball team? Nice comment and block by the way...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mapletml24 Tulowitzki admitted after the game that he told the ump it wasn't a strike when as he was taking the field!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mapletml24 I never said he was in the ump's when he was ejected. Guy couldn't stop running his mouth taking the field...childish behaviour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mapletml24 I think you need to watch the game again with an objective eye.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mapletml24 @Sportsnet So Tulowitzki didn't turn around &amp; run his mouth to the ump after being K'd? This BS conspiracy theory is getting old<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mapletml24 @Sportsnet It was inconsistent for both teams. And I don't recall the #Royals losing it over called strikes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sportsnet Chirping the ump on balls &amp; strikes in a blow out game = reputation = quick boot. Win with class ffs! #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Exposed their bullpen tonight I think, undone by two bad innings, got close. Things to work with. #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As a Canadian, I have nothing against the #BlueJays, but I don't know if they have a likeable player on that team. #Royals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tulowitzki showing some of that typical Toronto class.  #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dig in here boys, no quit. #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Agreed. I've been trying to get a picture of this guy's zone since the start<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alright Cueto, time to deal baby! #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevormcgow43 Come on man, you don't need to make ridiculous excuses just because you don't like the outcome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Trevormcgow43 @Sportsnet What effect would that have on the outcome? So much whining...the dome, strike zone, scheduling... #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GreggZaun Really? A fan called Goins off? From 60 feet away in a place as loud as an airplane? #Excuses #BlueJays  #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Never quit man! #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Beauty come back, no quit in this team. And not a #BatFlip to be seen. #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichelleDBeadle My wife wants to know if there were blueberries in the coffee cake?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Great play by Hosmer to break for 2nd early on that ground ball #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ump's been calling that strike for BOTH teams all f**king day Bautista. Stop whining. #BlueJays #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Out of a nasty jam. Let's grab a few runs here boys! #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alcides! Yeah baby, #TakeItAway #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Even they're getting a little tired of Bautista's antics...see that dive on the high pitch? Brutal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Have to shout out to a few good #BlueJays fans that came by to watch Gm 1 tonight, not all beer throwing jerks! #Royals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Escobar plants, that might be two...no damage done though! #Royals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Game one, #Royals Solid performance, beauty! #TakeTheCrown #CanadianRoyalsGuy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @mellinger @TLKU1993 Madson makes me nervous for some reason...no damage today though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow, Bautista, nice sportsmanship there faking the ball flip to the fans #sarcasm #Royals #TakeTheCrown @AngryPensGnome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn Bautista, do you have to whine about everything??? #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Well it was either that or argue balls and strikes. #Royals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ALCS Gm 1 party: "Flip a Bat Like a Douchebag" game. Flip the bat from home plate into the bullpen! @AngryPensGnome  http://t.co/rsm4v8b5I5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Not looking forward to all the "MLB doesn't want Toronto to win talk"...it's brutal here<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Cueto was dealin' tonight and that's going to be a huge boost for him and the team going forward<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tweettie_J_bird @AngryPensGnome Bush league shit from the fans, great come back, and typical arrogant Bautista<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tweettie_J_bird @AngryPensGnome That was insane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome One down, back to work on Friday! Best round of baseball series' I've seen. #MLBPlayoffs #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hell of a series @astros! #Royals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Step 1. #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boom! #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's make this runner count boys! #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Sens scoring all their goals tonight?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gotta cash in here boys! #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Foot on the gas boys, all night! #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBCToronto @CBCNews Wow, you must have been at the RC throwing junk on the field too, eh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kaylasea_ Bush league stuff going on up here!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3-run homer to go up, and #BlueJays fans still throwing crap on the field. Embarrassing. Happy to be a #Royals fan today. #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, I've seen f**king everything now. #BlueJays . Almost afraid to watch the #Royals game later. #UFOs #Lightning #Meteors #WhatNext<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How insane is it that Martin was the first guy aboard in this inning and the bloop single to tie it goes over Odor's head??? #MLB #BlueJays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Most Little League teams would have gotten out of this inning already. #MLB #LittleLeague<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EastlinkMattB Only bad call by the ump was trying to wave the play dead...rough break for the Jays. Brutal reaction from the fans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy shit, is there any class among fans in that ballpark? #BlueJays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow. Russell Martin, ya blew it. What a way to give up a run. #BlueJays<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBCNews @BlueJays At least the bandwagoners have an excuse should the team lose tonight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBCNews @BlueJays If you think they need the roof open in order to win, you don't think much of your team, do you Jays fans?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Back to the K! #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Heat. #Royals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have no idea where this ump's strike zone is. #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hos! #TouchEmAll #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Think this guy's strike zone is some kind of weird 9-point star or some shit like that #Royals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Wow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Well done, young man #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Maybe pull a Homer Simpson and get beaned?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Retracted!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn, how is Dyson not on 2nd yet! #Royals #TakeTheCrown @AngryPensGnome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Clutch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Squeeze! #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Big, big break. #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Beauty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh baby... #Royals #TakeTheCrown @AngryPensGnome<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Awfully risky...better to come away with anything here than sell the farm right away I think...I could be wrong! #Royals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome yup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Someone needs to start giving a shit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still time, no more BS. #Royals #TakeTheCrown<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mlscote @AngryPensGnome I'd buy Quebec, but the competition fees would probably cripple a S. Ontario bid...likely paid to both Buf and Tor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mlscote @AngryPensGnome @TSNBobMcKenzie And driving hockey down the throats of those who don't really care isn't going to work<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mlscote @AngryPensGnome @TSNBobMcKenzie Well moving out of Arizona to Vegas, Seattle or KC wouldn't really rock that boat too much IMO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @TSNBobMcKenzie ...time to optimize.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @TSNBobMcKenzie Not really punishing fan base if some rinks are half empty anyway. Early 90s were about growing the game...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @TSNBobMcKenzie Disagree. IMO relocation should trump expansion. Improve the existing league rater than diluting it further.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau @AngryPensGnome @gadus07 @marcmackinnon4 @ryjameson @ScienceNews Free Tom!!! #ButSeriouslyFolks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Duncan Keith...#wow #StanleyCup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hey @NHL , please put the dying coyote out of it's misery and get that team out of Arizona. #EnoughIsEnough #arizonacoyotes @ArizonaCoyotes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@simmonssteve @DarrenDreger Another rookie that needs to learn his place and earn his shot. Not pout like he did when TB sent him back to jr<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hockeynight Step 1: Get rid of Strombo. #NoMoreHockeyNightInHipstertown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxjacobsen Tough to not have an apathetic stance on anything FIFA these days!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxjacobsen I think there will be when they host again. Footy is in a very different place in the US than it was in '94.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxjacobsen @TheWeek Probably not the next one, but 2022 has my money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gadus07 Also intriguing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gadus07 2018 to USA?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gadus07 Damned great news!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gadus07 But Vieira will fit right in with Les Magpies!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gadus07 Like to see a more experienced guy who can attract talent, but it may not matter as long as Ashley is around!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @TSN_Sports @Sportsnet #HireStanleyAndJenkins<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Should've pulled harder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome I'm full of beer and BBQ,  viva la OT! Of course, NYR will need to score at some point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome This was bound to happen really #HireCoachGordonBombay<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Luckily whoever wins the west should roll over the east in the final!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome But it is especially douchey that TB won't let visiting fans wear their jerseys at games...or sell tix to non-Florida folks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome I can't pick a team in that series really. Don't want to see either win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Damn, I forgot about the Strombo experiment in my rant! They should rename HNIC to "Hockey for Hipsters"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Couldn't be worse than those bozos! #TSN #Sportsnet #HireStanleyAndJenkins<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome ...worse that we have to hear it from the likes of Healy, Kypreos, and PJ Stock...how are we not hockey broadcasters???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome That's hockey talk man. As if two CF game 7s weren't news enough, always has to be a "big story"....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pdawg57 @RyanatLFPress @Sportsnet ...may have considered it a single continuous play. Not sure I agree, given he took three shots at it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pdawg57 @RyanatLFPress @Sportsnet Like to hear the ref explain this one. Can go into crease to get the puck but looked like interference...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@affabletoaster #GoScience<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxjacobsen #boo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxjacobsen Great, can I get a meatball sandwich sometime around 4pm? #justkidding #butnotreally<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxjacobsen I'm not sure what would ever give you such a preposterous idea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PanofSCU @AngrySensGnome @sensunderground I'm sure Karlson gets a lot of comfort from that...you know PK has one too, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @PanofSCU @sensunderground ...Bettman will be by with your consolation prize any time now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @PanofSCU @sensunderground Hahaha...happy to see you all have saved up your "evidence"...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PanofSCU @AngrySensGnome @sensunderground Two seasons ago, sorry I'm not crying still.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sensunderground @AngrySensGnome @PanofSCU Let it go kids, life's a lot more fun that way. #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sensunderground @AngrySensGnome @PanofSCU I love that it's been nearly a month since the playoffs began, and Sens fans are still butt hurt!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great season lads. Hope to see some goal scoring help come our way in the offseason. We'll be back. #GoHabsGo @CanadiensMTL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Yup, stupid is everywhere.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That's what happens when you get Bishop going side to side. #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why would you not make a 6'7" goalie move side to side on a breakaway???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time to empty the tanks boys. #NoQuit #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sure the Hab-haters are thumbing their dictionaries and thesauruses right now for quips to unleash should this score hold. #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bad luck in the 1st. Fore check looked great early on, gotta see more of that going forward! #GoHabsGo #OneGameOneWin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy shit Marky, you need a new batch of sticks! #WoodenSticksForever #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Game 6 is all about the focus boys! Pressure's all on them, let's take advantage tonight. #OneGameOneWin #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mlscote This game is going to be all about weathering the early storm for the #Habs.  #OneGameOneWin #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sportsnet And somehow #Habs haters will find a way to blame this on #PKSubban #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TB Ryan Callahan out after emerg. appendectomy. Somehow #Habs haters will find a way to blame this on @PKSubban1 #GoHabsGo #OneGameOneWin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brady got 4 games, which I predicted. I also predicted he would appeal and serve 2...standby for confirmation. #TSN #HireMe #NFL @TSN_Sports<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gregorydbrown Spicy Roulette Doritos...I have rarely felt so alive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Good to get those wins, good character builder for the team. That kind of stuff pays off later in the season<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryHabsGnome #OneGameOneWin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryHabsGnome @AngrySensGnome #OneGameOneWin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryHabsGnome @CP0031 @CanadiensMTL @NHL Incredible that he slides, pretty much stops, then has to reset with the glove.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alright boys! Another trip to Florida, pressure's on the home team now. #OneGameOneWin #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woooo....PA! I wholeheartedly apologize to my wife and the neighbours...that might have been a "bit" loud. #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Game tied, Sens Gnome is back. Hmm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@strombo Holy god, your pants are ridiculous. Talk to Don Cherry before you can't have kids! @CoachsCornerCBC @jtmacdougall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PP looking good tonight even if it is fruitless. #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryHabsGnome And 6'7" is a long way to fall! #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love that the ref is giving Bishop a talking to about all the flopping around @AngryHabsGnome #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jtmacdougall @CoachsCornerCBC #facepalm But yes, my wine is delicious. #WhatABeauty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jtmacdougall @CoachsCornerCBC Don's gettin' a little long in the tooth, but he knows 2 things: #Hockey and #Suits #Beauty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NHL Umm...it...went...in. why am I not working for the league. #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Post...wait!..what? Gooooooaaaalllllllll!!!!! DSP! #GoHabsGo #OneGameOneWin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We need to play as hard as Ginette Reno sang that anthem! #GiveEr #OneGameOneWin #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We know the formula, now it's all in the execution. #OneGameOneWin #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tisshe @ChefMichaelSmth  It worked out pretty well! Had a lamb + fruit craving at the market today!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChefMichaelSmth ...and a mojito compliments of my Wifeski! @jtmacdougall #MojitosForAll<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>BBQ season! NS lamb burger with mint/rosemary infused blueberry/bell pepper sauce. @ChefMichaelSmth #BBQWeirdness  http://t.co/3z4t3KQZ0j<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The more I see the replay, the more I think the #Caps got hosed on that no-goal #CapsNYR #NHLPlayoffs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jtmacdougall @AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau Wooooooooooo! #Habs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tonight, one game, one win. Back to the Bell Centre on Saturday. #OneGameOneWin #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome 19:31 of the 1st. Fact.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau Good then. By the way, according to The Score app, MacArthur was tagged for embellishment on Nov 20<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau You need a hobby my friend! Cross-stitch is fun according to @jtmacdougall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau Holy shit man, whatever, let it go. PK could be the biggest diver in the game, don't care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau Habs blogs? Not sure where that came from<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau Ottawa took more diving penalties than Montreal. Your team embellishes more often this season.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau ...and, MTL had three individual diving penalties this year, OTT had 4, Pens had 5...miss that stat?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau Habs were fined twice, 8 other teams were also fined, ypu make it sound like we had 12!...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Well that's pretty much been the game, has it not? #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Seriously, Coburn! Feels a tap, goes down like a rock. Hab haters wanna chirp about that? Don Cherry was right about that guy #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So many monkeys being shaken off the #Habs backs tonight. #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hell of a period. #KeepItGoing #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing else to say now. Win or go home. #Win #NoQuit #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau @AngryHabsGnome @gadus07 But how can you fault Price for the mess the Habs have made? No sense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome @darekmoreau @AngryHabsGnome @gadus07 Didn't realize we were comparing goalie dicks here! #LetItGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau @AngryHabsGnome @gadus07 NFL that should be<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau @AngryHabsGnome @gadus07 No way FL goes more than 4 based on "probably".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau @AngryHabsGnome @gadus07 Brady gets 4 games, appeals, maybe reduced to 2.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau @AngryHabsGnome @gadus07 Unproven? Price has been stellar in this playoff!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau @AngryHabsGnome @AngryPensGnome @gadus07 Was speaking in terms of defensive performance. Last nights gaff aside<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darekmoreau @AngrySensGnome @AngryHabsGnome @AngryPensGnome @gadus07 There will have to be. Wasting MVP-like play from Price and the D<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, no more losses to give now. Time to win. #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Best keeper, solid D, putrid offence. How can an NHL PP be that bad???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Not even a below average team, Price+D held NHL best offence for 59:59, but couldn't get 2 goals for a W.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Never should be at that point. All heart guys up front, little skill and finishing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome That had nothing to do with Johnson, all to do with a missed assignment, and no goal support in a deadly game for MTL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome Oh man, are you seriously still on about that? #SensEcho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a waste of a great game by the #Habs. This one's on you Norris Trophy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bergevin, go out in the offseason and bring in some fucking goal scorers. @GMolsonCHC you have the fucking cash, spend it! @CanadiensMTL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy Birthday @BGALLY17 !!!! #GoHabsGo #WinThe3rd #NotDoneYet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You have got to be kidding me!!! What are these refs calling? #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryHabsGnome @darekmoreau @AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome @gadus07 Hockey weather! #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely nothing going for the #Habs in this one. Now it's time to show why you deserve that CH boys! #GoHabsGo #WinThe3rd #12WToGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn, just a little luck here...maybe? #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Goddamn, PK is shooting rockets on one-timers tonight #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And Bishop with a dive, refs takes it hook, line and sinker. #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Game 3, take it lads! #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jtmacdougall Maybe this is for you! #Mojito  https://t.co/1bEEvKuPl9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome You realize this all happens a hundred times a game right? Go too far, it's a penalty, and the penalty was called.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hfxtraffic @Brett_CBC Or loss...you'd need a forklift to get that Smart car out of there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Wish I had a back yard. This is fucking brutal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow...so I think you assholes that chirp about the refs calling the game for the Habs can pretty much give up on that. #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get Price out now. He doesn't need to be subjected to the lack of effort his team is giving him now. #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Amazing how Montreal sports writers LOVE to see the Habs in peril.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Woah, thought you were out gardening since we hadn't heard you chime in tonight!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hockey tip: Stay out of the fucking penalty box. #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Petry! Finally a first period goal #GoHabsGo #KeepItGoing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Considering watching the Habs game in Punjabi so I don't have to listen to the inane babble of #GlennHealy #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Game 2...take this one boys! #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn, easy decision for Floyd. #MayPac<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mayweather walks in with the Burger King? WTF? #MayweatherPacquiao #MayPac<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mayweather-Pacquiao now! Come on Manny, knock this asshole out! #MayweatherPacquiao #MayPac<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Who gives a shit if the play was offside on Kucherov's goal??? It's done. Get over it. Still  #12WToGo #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well fuck...that's one. This will not be a short series. Pull the socks up boys, take game two.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxjacobsen Why?....why, oh why say it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@affabletoaster it shouldn't be a surprise!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@affabletoaster That's the trick! Looking forward to the challenge...luckily, I know you so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@affabletoaster I see what you did there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I have zero affection for Bears as a football franchise but this is special #Bears #Cowboys #ThumbsUp   https://t.co/n5ztJ433RL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@affabletoaster Excellent...I need to capture that on "film"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Well ya, because Stamkos is a bare-knuckle boxing champion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Goddamn these composite sticks #GoHabsGo #WoodenSticksForever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome You realize he doesn't play for the Habs, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now would be a good time for one of the Old Ghosts to show up! #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Winner of this game might be "off the scoreboard, off the section 40 beer guy, off the glass stanchion, off Glenn Healy and in" #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No way that's counting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Looking for another Texas-leaguer against Bishop here! #SeeingEyeGWG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Betting on Mayweather-Pacquiao, watch this! Sportsin' Around with Jenny MacAdoo!  http://t.co/w3esmytZmw<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome I don't know...Bettman and co. aren't big fans of mine...I'm getting a 5'er<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Dude, it's the playoffs, everybody is playing hurt! #ThatsHockey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok, the Jenkins News Network is projecting a Blackhawks-Duck west final. #AsPoliticalAsIGet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome Goddamn...five and a game to me for improper grammar...In-person hearing with the NHL tomorrow #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Seriously man, talk about something else...Gally bumps a guy and he's hurt for a bit and it's another grand conspiracy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome POS = Play -Off Star baby #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @TSNSteve Geezus, hopefully TB is as preoccupied with that as you are, we'll have no problem #LetItGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @TSNSteve Keep going boys! Sens next game is some time in early October....tick, tock, tick tock...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boom! Here we go... #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TSNSteve Boo hoo...anything else you want to cry about Ottawa fanboy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Goddamn...this PP needs to get something, anything, going #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Only against the Ottawa Scrubs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha, Price is being a little "Ron Hextall-Billy Smith-y" tonight! #MyCrease #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, now we're even on quick whistles! #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ladies and gentlemen, madames et monsieurs, Ginette Reno! #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pre-game ritual. #Habs are unbeaten in the playoffs when I'm clean shaven, 0-2 when not #PlayoffsAntiBeard #GoHabsGo  http://t.co/4uz1jduDLt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Damn, thought I was getting some beer out of this!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Baha...wager you a case of beer it's Price! #DealOrNoDeal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tampa Bay up next. Another tough series ahead but we have the old ghosts on our side! #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Yup, saw this earlier...sick catch, nothing like hurling yourself head-long into the seats!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryHabsGnome I'm hoping it goes that way. TB has had our number all year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So PK is also a Dallas Cowboys fan...now folks can hate him even more. Maybe next game I'll wear my Cowboys jersey under the CH! #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryHabsGnome Who's next? #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Done. #12WToGo #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesus Price! #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome I'm going to assume Audra grabbed your device and sent that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy crap how many chances are we going to miss?!?!? #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @darekmoreau Ha...10-4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why all the passes????? #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Hahahaha...so that wasn't a penalty?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome If the ref was on the other side, it's 1-1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Man seriously, you see that shit all the time when the ref loses sight of the puck. Nobody's saying it was the right call<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Ha, hey man, Jen wanted her honeymoon in Vegas! So what's a fella to do? ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Dude if you're going to shit talk Habs fans, fine, but if you're cool with that chant what's the difference???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome There are major assholes at every rink man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome We'll have to work on that...Vegas in three weeks though. We can meet up there if you like ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Like I said, good to have a great keeper!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Better to have the best in hockey back there than not, right? Don't forget Sens are only in because a rookie had a hot run<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Ha, yeah ok...you'll never hear me saying that bullshit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Healy's an idiot. And that explanation of the quick whistle was dumb. Ref lost sight of the puck, simple as that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And Sens fans with the "ref you suck" chant for the second time this game. Clear sign of class #sarcasm #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Got away with one there! #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Petry!!!! How'd you miss that?!??!?! #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fuck yeah! Gally!!! Startin' shit and scoring goals! #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Flynn<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lets get it done tonight boys! #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome It must be in his contract<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Ha, I'm glad they didn't. Anderson believes his own hype and the bubble's going to burst.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Adversity happens, even against the scrubs. #GoHabsGo #13WToGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome We've played solid hocky all year, cruised into the playoffs and now have to show why we're the top team in the country<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome And will be expected to win at home #BadNews #HopeYouEnjoyedTheRun<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's going to suck getting eliminated at home #Sens...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Dude, you came up with the spear price hash tag.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fucks sake, I'm getting dumber just listening to Dave Cameron talk...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome What happened to all this Sens class?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now we need the PP to step up. #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Desharnais...fucking stupid penalty, no reason. Pull your fucking socks up boys, this is getting old quick #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glenn Healy: Restating the obvious since...ummm...well who f**king knows. #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Just a guy you love to have on your team, but hate to play against<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that was about as awful a period as it could have been. #OwnTheSecondPeriod #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Geeze, who's fappin' now?!?!?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on lads, gotta tighten this shit up #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Probably...that was a fearsome scoring rush ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Sens score in the first guaranteeing a #Habs win! #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryHabsGnome we need Hal Gill in front of the net! @Skillsy75<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryHabsGnome Renald you should get out there on the PP...we need a PP boost! #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh baby, #Sens have a serious case of jitters early! #GoHabsGo #PP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ginette Reno! Best in the biz folks. #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well, enjoy that win Ottawa...there won't be many more in this series #GoHabsGo #13WToGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2/2 It was a shit call, but come on!!! Talk about Sens-colored-glasses! Wooo boy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1/2 WTF? For all the Sens fans posting/retweeting video of that faceoff: Do you ACTUALLY not see the stick hit the hand/puck?...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome And hard as a coffin nail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tweettie_J_bird Good chance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Obscure penalty there...take advantage boys! #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good period boys, had the run of play, goal next! #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Geezus, firewagon hockey now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome *shit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome It was a shot both the Sens not hitting PK, and at Boston not making the playoffs. I'm an equal opportunity shut talker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not much of a PP here #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome No worries, they'll get a chance when they're shaking hands at the end of the game #HaventSeenLucicInAWhile<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Karlson's probably the only one that skates well enough for that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alright lads, get it done, then it's #HomeForARest #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome This is what can happen when you build for a cup ('09) without a truly effective development system to follow it up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gadus07 The saga continues on Tyneside...ugh...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Moot point in the playoffs, and especially OT. Something to talk about, but that's about it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome I dont need to tell you that there's no winning in a system like that. Miracle 20-1 runs notwithstanding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Perhaps, but whatever light you look at it in, 3 W's is 3 W's. #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Habs had 49 SOG tonight, and outshot Sens 40-22 from the 2nd onward. Might have had 8 on Hammond #GoodGameAndy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome I never said they dominated, I said they've outplayed the Sens when it mattered #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Spoken like a true Hab hater! #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome And 1 PP goal...cold fact, Sens have been outplayed when it all matters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ThatFishCreigh @AngrySensGnome Hahaha...and we have what, 1 PP goal? Weak.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And boom goes the dyn-o-mite! #13WToGo #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pacioretty, what the fuck!!!!! #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Alright boys! Been here before, got the job done. #HabsOTMagic #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Got caught sitting on that lead! #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Woo-Wiese!!! #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's get it done in the 3rd boys #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome @AngryHabsGnome Better look up Patrick Lalime's phone number<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome @AngryHabsGnome PK's in their heads...will work to our advantage once this early, unsustainable tide ebbs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome @AngryHabsGnome Dive??? Watch the replay...for fucks sake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vuic with the dirty dangle for the goal! 1-0 Moose #JustForKes @jtmacdougall @ecologyfunkes @astounding202 @ashleyjmorton @MichelleDumoul1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome Close to shooting themselves in the foot with all the penalties<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yikes, Ryan Stanley is actually UFC's Johnny Hendricks. Better stop talking shit about the Sens. @AngrySensGnome  http://t.co/hTEQh4gcyZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome @AngryHabsGnome Assholes like that exist everywhere and unfortunately they come to hockey games sometimes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau @AngryPensGnome And are up 2-0.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau @AngryPensGnome #GoHabsGo #14WToGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau @AngryPensGnome Better team all season 2: playoff squeaker 0...sorry boys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau @AngryPensGnome Weak buddy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau @AngryPensGnome @AngryHabsGnome WTF man? Why would you hope for an opponent injury?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darekmoreau @AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome @AngryHabsGnome Two games ago Hammond was the second coming of Christ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darekmoreau @AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome @AngryHabsGnome And boom goes the dynamite!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KateBeirness Only Desharnais #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome @AngryHabsGnome 10-4 man...that's why I love/hate you guys. But, hell of a start for the Royals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome @AngryHabsGnome I lost my shit because it's a poor comparison!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @NHL @AngrySensGnome @AngryHabsGnome If hockey is that bad, don't watch it...it's hockey...toughest fuckers on the planet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome @AngryHabsGnome Fuck yeah I brought it cuz it's fun...as long as no one's getting their panties in a knot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome @AngryHabsGnome And when he was a Hab, he was the dirtiest fucker in the universe<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome @AngryHabsGnome Fucks sake...when did hockey smack talk turn into a feelings thing???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome @AngryHabsGnome To whom? Pens needed a "rat" like Subban last night...or someone with some balls anyway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, apparently the game plan for Ottawa is to lay on the ice...as much as possible. #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha, Lazar my boy, you're out of your weight class with Emelin. #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome @AngryHabsGnome Good to hear...play nice...Sens suck ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's take two! #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome @AngryHabsGnome Jesus christ Stanley...taking this personally or what?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome @AngryHabsGnome Stone a go...what a f**king surprise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome That's not really a counter-arguement...the ref doesn't give an MRI prior to making a call<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Well since the slashing major hinges on a player being injured, I can see his point since Stone missed very little time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome @AngryHabsGnome Thats the beauty of it. It's not a distraction in the Habs dressing room!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome @AngryHabsGnome Again, stuff that would be fine if he was a Sen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome @AngryHabsGnome So every guy that gets 5 and the game plays without respect?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome @AngryHabsGnome His slash was a reckless event, but it's not indicative of Subban as a player<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome @AngryHabsGnome ..you guys don't like him because he's cocky (with the skill to back it up) and a Canadien..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome @AngryHabsGnome Subban plays with a lot of intensity but he isn't a guy that's out there to hurt people...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome @darekmoreau Slash angers me too...why can't he and Axel Rose just kiss and make up! #GNRReunion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome @AngryHabsGnome Holy shit boys, comparing Subban to Matt Cooke??? @Just_For_Laughs is looking for new acts!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau @AngryPensGnome @AngryHabsGnome Happy we're all in agreement that the Sens shit the bed last night<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome @AngryHabsGnome @darekmoreau Hockey is hockey to me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome @AngryHabsGnome @darekmoreau Ha, not me baby.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome @AngryHabsGnome @darekmoreau But the refs call it as they see it, nothing to be done about it but play on<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome @AngryHabsGnome @darekmoreau I thought the 5/game was harsh, and a suspension would be more so...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome @AngryHabsGnome @darekmoreau Either way you won't see me crying about the state of the league...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome @gadus07 @AngryHabsGnome @darekmoreau @tweettie_J_bird Love to hear the Hab-haters! #15WToGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome @AngryHabsGnome @darekmoreau ...and when they aren't, they have the refs in their pockets<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome @AngryHabsGnome @darekmoreau Kind of funny that the Habs are the dirtiest team on earth all of a sudden...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darekmoreau @AngryPensGnome @gadus07 @AngryHabsGnome @tweettie_J_bird Go on...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @gadus07 @AngryHabsGnome @darekmoreau @tweettie_J_bird And if PK is suspended, it's a joke, not even worthy of the major<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @gadus07 @AngryHabsGnome @darekmoreau @tweettie_J_bird I don't think the league is that bad at discipline!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @gadus07 @AngryHabsGnome @darekmoreau @tweettie_J_bird Not after Dave Cameron shoved his foot in his mouth lke he did!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Shouldn't they be with a head coach making that sort of comment?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Game 2 to come! ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome The old tactic, drumming  up some "world-is-against-us" drama<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Might be best if no Sen speaks to the media again in this series.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome ...but he didn't. And now that I've actually seen the slash, 5 and a game was brutally ridiculous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And then Dave Cameron opened his mouth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darekmoreau @AngryHabsGnome @tweettie_J_bird @gadus07 A win is a win this time of year! #15WToGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One in the books! #GoHabsGo #15ToGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome hahaha holy crap man, bit much isn't it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome you'd trade half your team to have him!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau @AngryHabsGnome @marcmackinnon4 Goddamn son...hope you enjoyed that lead!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryHabsGnome @marcmackinnon4 @darekmoreau Dude I'm at a Mooseheads game, and we're going to f**king OT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryHabsGnome @marcmackinnon4 @darekmoreau Holy shit Stanley, you're going to implode before this series is over!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>25 timbits down...#PlayoffRingers @ashleyjmorton @MichelleDumoul1 @astounding202 @jtmacdougall @ecologyfunkes @mlscote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NikolajEhlers24 just smoked that litte dick Garland at center ice! @ashleyjmorton @astounding202 @jtmacdougall @mlscote @ecologyfunkes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome @AngryHabsGnome Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think Isles have the teeth for a run...not this year anyway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome @AngryHabsGnome Washington might be the most dangerous team outside of top seeds and TB<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome @AngryHabsGnome Ha, anything can happen, but I'm not an "impending calamity" Habs fan like the bloggers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome @AngryHabsGnome Right, so bet on a 1st place team all year or a Playoff squeaker relying on a rookie keeper?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome @AngryHabsGnome @AngryMUNGnome Sens have far more to worry about when the bubble pops for Hammond<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome @AngryHabsGnome @AngryMUNGnome No more than anyone else prior to game one and certainly not about Price<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome @AngryHabsGnome @AngryMUNGnome Finally? He had a great run last year before that jerk Kreider ran him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gadus07 Very classy @LFC Good to see 3 points isn't the only thing to play for. #FirstClassClubAndFans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HFXMooseheads ...and taking another stupid penalty kills that momentum #GottaLearnBoys<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@darekmoreau @gadus07 Dude, he stomped on the guy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome He gets paid right? He's not some intern or something?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome I'm sure he does #ThatsAPenisJoke<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@docdez All of them? I support our police/forces/govt fully, but we should have someone out in front of this, quelling rumours and such<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How the hell can the White House be making a statement on the #OttawaShooting before our own government/police??? #WTF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxjacobsen @elamin88 That may be the case, but it is quite distasteful to see within hours of a forces reservist being killed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxjacobsen @elamin88 I suppose that's more of a general observation on social media in general...I digress.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxjacobsen @elamin88 2/2 ... and that indicates to me that there should be an "Are you sure?" warning after people hit the Tweet button.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxjacobsen @elamin88 1/2 I'm sure it does speak to a lot of people...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxjacobsen @elamin88 I didn't say it was inaccurate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxjacobsen @elamin88 I doubt the family of the soldier shot at the War Memorial would share that sentiment.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxjacobsen @elamin88 The cartoon and the propagating of it. Events in Ottawa may be beyond our control, but we can control this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elamin88 @jaxjacobsen Why the fuck would anybody do this right now??? Unbelievable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @Royals Today's the day! #StatingTheObvious #Royals #WorldSeries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sweet baby Jesus, finally a win! @NUFC: FULL TIME Newcastle United 1-0 Leicester City #NUFC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @MLB @Royals Nice! How freakin' big's the stogie going to be if the boys in blue pull this off???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @Royals Bring on the World Series! From Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, home of the @HFXMooseheads  http://t.co/yNVROmkJOk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ashleyjmorton @HFXMooseheads Unfortunately all too familiar at these games.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jtmacdougall @Q104Halifax And again Lucic shows what a class act he is #CoughDouchebagCough<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome World Series!!! #Royals #MLBPlayoffs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Buddy, another one in the books! #JustKeepWinning #Royals #MLBPlayoffs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sportsnet Hittin' the Panik button already! #ItsOnlyOctober #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @Royals That's why they play the games baby!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sportsnet Says the guy reaching to remain relevant in hockey broadcasting since the real talent has migrated to sportsnet #TryAgain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Goodnight from Halifax buddy! #Royals #MLBPlayoffs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Holland looked like he was throwing invisible shit tonight! Damned gutsy wins, making me forget #NHL is days away #Royals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Man, the #Royals are not going easy on the folks in Atlantic time! #GoLateGoRoyals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jtmacdougall @hfxtransit I like eating and drinking all the things!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Gutsy win for the #Royals last night! Hope they keep 'er rollin' in California! #MLBPlayoffs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Hey buddy, playoffs! I'm representing in #Halifax #Royals #MLBplayoffs  http://t.co/3EXOYlUFP8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jtmacdougall @DowntownHalifax @theoldtriangle YES PLEASE! #showmethemoney<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jtmacdougall Baha! #RumIsForPiratesAndWinners<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome ha...yup.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tisshe ha...yup...I share an office with 5 others though. We need to embrace the afternoon nap time #IAmAToddler<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Boomer_Phillips I do Brick Top from the movie Snatch<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tisshe I'm there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mlscote @jaxjacobsen Canoe? Have you guys taken up fur trading? #CareerChange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jtmacdougall @YouGottaEatHere I'll get the bacon frying, Wifeski! #ProblemSolved<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rystanman Brilliant!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NUFC @EASPORTSFIFA Loved putting myself in the game at attacking MF, scoring a cracker v Sunderland with that scene as backdrop #FootyDream<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jtmacdougall @TheCaptainBacon So, this bacon, make it happen if you will #please<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimKrul That's our lad! Well done sir. #HowayTheLads #NUFC #WorldCup2014<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimKrul on in the 121st minute for the Oranje...penalty shootout feather in his hat if he wins this! #HowayTheLads #NUFC #NEDvsCRC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jtmacdougall She's not that fat!!! #AveryCat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HellsKitchenFOX Why can't these people cook fish or scallops?!?! You guys need a Newfie! #hellskitchen @jtmacdougall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#HolyShit Dempsey, how did you not finish that??? #USMNT #USAvsBEL #WorldCup2014<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well that's been coming for, oh, 92 minutes! #USMNT #WorldCup2014<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Also, I have been placed on waivers by the Buffalo Sabres #HotCommodity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I too have informed the @MiamiHEAT that I will be opting out of the final year of my contract #WhereToTakeMyTalent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Q104Halifax 4 months??? What a f**king joke #FIFA! This is the 3rd time that Suarez has bitten a guy! #WTF #WorldCup2014 #BanSuarez<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good to see this info going out! RT "@AquaCanada: Salmon federation still spreading incorrect information  http://t.co/FLBCYUTieX"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tisshe Ha, that would be amusing, but he shouldn't be playing #TheBeautifulGame #BanSuarez<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still cannot believe #LuisSuarez has bitten a player for a 3rd time. FIFA must give max ban and euro domestic leagues must follow suit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rjmackinnon But ultimately just another two cent opinion from an American with no appreciation for a game USA doesn't dominate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rjmackinnon Apologies, that was directed at the author! I might call that piece creative, but "great" is giving far too much credit IMO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rjmackinnon @MichaelFarber3 Great. More inane drivel. I say: "If it causes you such angst, don't watch it, don't write about it". Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ashleyjmorton No different than any other sport in that regard.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ashleyjmorton Just goes to show that some players' personality on the pitch can be a diametric opposite to the real man.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...may not be a fan of the player, but have to respect what he does off the pitch. #GoodOnYaLad #Respect @jtmacdougall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow, so C. Ronaldo got his hair cut to match the scars on a young cancer sufferer, and also paid his treatment  http://t.co/gh76Xvr0Yt ...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Well that's probably what you'll see between USA and GER on Thursday...draw puts both through<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Way too non-chalant on that one Bradley! Gonna need a more killer finish even without the keeper in there. #USMNT #WorldCup2014<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Howard discovers that the butterfly is an ineffective goaltending technique in football #USMNT #WorldCup2014<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@natewilke @gadus07 Trading in my yankees hat is finally paying off ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxjacobsen Come on, I know @mlscote may not be a morning person but calling him Bad Company is #harsh ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BSommerhalder Can't believe what's gone down politically since the departure of Danny Williams. No one capable of leading.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome 3 points for the #USMNT v. GHA but I suspect GER &amp; POR will expose them on the counter attack too easily #WorldCup2014<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Damn! Face kick! @clint_dempsey with the broken nose to be sure #crunch #WorldCup2014 #USAvGHA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If not for Marty St. Louis, I would have some awful shit to say about NYR #goodriddance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TSN_Sports Geeze folks, no love for the Nordiques! #BattleOfQuebec<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Sounds like they have a bit of turmoil surrounding Klinsmann's style though. Man's a winner, hope they buy in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sportsnet #CaliforniaChrome owner made a good point, but to react the way he did was absolutely embarrassing #SoreLoser<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't stop this guy even 70 years later! Mission accomplished!  http://t.co/LGOXe7s75e #DDay70<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBCMaritimeNoon Typical. More guns means more guns in the hands of the wrong people, which equates to more dead people<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBCDDayLive Incredible project, absolutely fascinating, and somewhat scary/intense at the same time #DDay70 #DDayLive<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BSommerhalder Or endanger them by tweeting RCMP locations during a manhunt. Tweet first think later for far too many<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jtmacdougall I don't think it was open those times of the year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's get this done boys! #Hard20Minutes #LightTheLamp @CanadiensMTL #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoachsCornerCBC Tonight Don Cherry's outfit brought to you by @NUFC #HowayTheLads #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanadiensMTL WTF are we doing with the puck in our own end??? Again? #TightenItUp #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So no high sticks are going to be called against NYR now? #ComeOnRef #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sportsnet This is the mentality that will take the @Raptors, wait for it...#nowhere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great game tonight, a few bad minutes, but Tokarski made the saves that counted! Back to NYC! #6ToGo #GoHabsGo @CanadiensMTL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome I said Prust deserved 2 games, but this was a headhunter hit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome One bad one in 4 games #NoWorries Got it back already #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Looking sharp tonight! #GoHabsGo @CanadiensMTL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #GhostsOfTheForum will be in fine form tonight I have no doubt! #GoHabsGo @CanadiensMTL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jtmacdougall @DurtyNellysPub Fair enough, one of the many reasons you're the best Wifeski! #GoHabsGo #SaveUsAGoodTable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jtmacdougall @DurtyNellysPub Is this your way of telling me you want to go to the pub tonight? #WeeknightPubNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So what the fuck is with the Habs-lose-glee with the @hockeynight crew? #HNIC #LeafsOrBust @PJStockHNIC @KellyHrudey #JoinNBCPlease<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OT...who's going to win it for the Habs? Desharnais, you are due my friend! #GoHabsGo @CanadiensMTL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WTF is with the Rangers and all the high sticks??? #NotAPinataParty #GoHabsGo @CanadiensMTL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Look who's back, back again, PK's back, #TellAFriend #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Big third! #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>TOKARSKI WITH THE GLOVE!!! #HolyShit #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boom! Bouillion! Keep it going boys! #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Pernell Karl has to step up at some point. He's been f**king brutal lately<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on boys, need to step up the intensity a bit here! Go Habs Go! @CanadiensMTL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WhitlockJason "In Bruges" - Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, Ralph Fiennes...sneaky good to be sure!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rangerfan41 I'm still laughing... #cheers #AndStillLaughing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rangerfan41 hahaha...man I dig fucking with people like you! By the way Einstein, "you're" = "you are", "your" implies possession #Grammar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rangerfan41 I can admit a dirty hit by Prust, but you're still making excuses for Kreider and even Carcillo...enjoy Sunday's game #cheers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rangerfan41 ha, frame by frame excuses, it doesn't make physical sense for a guy to fall like that with contact to the front of his leg!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rangerfan41 Except for a slapshot I should say<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rangerfan41 ...and 2, a left handed shooter puts his weight on his left leg when shooting, not the right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rangerfan41 2 points: 1 If the contact was that hard, why didn't the struck leg get swept out causing a forward fall?...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rangerfan41 Contact doesn't mean you go flying in! He makes no attempt to avoid the goalie is the point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rangerfan41 Price ends up hurt anyway. Not sure if you ever played, no way Emelin's contact with Kreider sends him into the net like that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rangerfan41 Not making excuses for Gally...pay attention.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rangerfan41 Typical guy that feels the contact and uses it as an excuse to fly into the keeper...seen it too many times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rangerfan41 And it's good to see you can have a civilized conversation. #sarcasm #YouWontGetTheQuip<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rangerfan41 Penalties, perhaps not, but he's run Anderson from OTT, Fleury, Price, and Tokarski. Guy touching him near the net isn't SHOVED<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rangerfan41 @TSNBobMcKenzie And yes, Kreider's actions should have been reviewed. He has a history, did it again last night on Tokarski.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rangerfan41 @TSNBobMcKenzie I'm a Habs fan, Prust should and will be suspended. But people that are talking 5+ games will be disappointed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boy I'll tell ya, Dustin Tokarski doesn't talk like a rookie keeper...guy's got his head on straight for sure. @CanadiensMTL #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxjacobsen It's ok, your bandwagon ticket gets you back on...but let that be a lesson! #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxjacobsen #IToldYouSo We got a heartbeat! #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is what can happen when your goalie keeps you in it! Tokarski was all three stars tonight! #7ToGo #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you don't touch the pick for last two minutes, what else do you expect??? Pick your f**king balls up and play some hockey #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That douchebag Kreider's running at the goalie again..someone should f**king fill him in! #NeedsToPay #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Holy shit, what a game Tokarski's having! Giving us a chance here! #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanadiensMTL Tokarski's in this one, let's go get him some offensive support in the second #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanadiensMTL Pretty irked by all the Habs fans giving up on the team. Trade in your CH for a maple leaf for f**ks sake #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tisshe Hey b'y? :p<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HellsKitchenFOX Campfire, homemade frying pan, perfect scallops. Why can't your chefs do this? :p @jtmacdougall  http://t.co/ou7NY6Spm9<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gerrydee ...and the handshake should be the signal that what happens on the ice, stays there, not the place for Lucic's antics. #respect<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gerrydee It's all about respect. Players should be big enough to respect the effort of other players, even if they don't "like" them...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxjacobsen I thought if they played with speed and strong forecheck, they'd win #TheyDidAndTheyDid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxjacobsen Ha, much to my delight they don't seem to have done much! #StayClassy #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gerrydee Happy to have you on board! #RoomForAllOnThisRide<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love it! "@perreaux: For those catching up on last night's action: Broken windows: 0. Damaged cars: 0. Couple arrests. A win for Montreal."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Party classy Montreal! #GoHabsGo #respect #8ToGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unbelieveable couple of games! Couldn't have played better boys! #KeepErRollin #8ToGo #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boom! Briere!!!! 3-1 Habs!!!! #TakeItHome #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanadiensMTL Gotta call that on Boychuk! Man, Bournival has looked good again tonight! Big PP boys! #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanadiensMTL Gotta love @BGALLY17 yapping and going at Chara all the way! #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanadiensMTL #Hard20Minutes to take it home boys! #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanadiensMTL Yessssss!!!! Pacioretty for 2-0! #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanadiensMTL The more Boston tries to open this game up, the more chances we're going to get! #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh Brad Marchand, well done buddy! @CanadiensMTL #ThanksForThePP #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanadiensMTL Chara does that every time he takes a guy to he boards #BearHug #LookingForLove #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HealyPredicts Hey Heals, got a Boston jersey on tonight, eh? Still sore about '93?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanadiensMTL Wiese!!! 1-0 Habs #GreatStart #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanadiensMTL Alright boys, play your game and we take this one! #Game7 #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HFXMooseheads Who do you think is happier today? Drouin for leading the scoring, or Mantha for leading the champs? #NotAboutThePoints<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congrats @LesForeurs on the Q title win! Very well coached team. Go on boys and continue the Q dominance at the #MemorialCup @HFXMooseheads<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Goodnight twitter world, see you Wednesday night for game 7! @CanadiensMTL #GoHabsGo #9ToGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gonna play a YouTube vid of @GinetteRenoVIP's #OCanada before game 7, Rene Rancourt sings it like it's his first time #IsCarlLewisAvailable<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ashleyjmorton Well at least they aren't wearing Phil Kessel jerseys.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ashleyjmorton F**king hipsters! #TheyAreNotTakingHockeyFromUs #OrMyBeard<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sportsnet Habs/Bruins '79...Was only two years old, but it's all my Dad talked about for 35 years! #NeverGetsOld<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tsnjamesduthie Come on Duthie, I beat you to that one by 18 minutes! #GetMeAJobOnTSN #ImBetterThanKouleas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sorry @NHLBruins, but Carey Price has played and won 4 elimination games this year #BringOnGame7 #Sochi2014 @CanadiensMTL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And now the true @NHLBruins come out. #BandOfGoons #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can we bring @GinetteRenoVIP to Boston? @CanadiensMTL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MauricePrice17 2 things: 1.It's 2014 no room for your anti-gay shit; 2.You're a #CFL WR so you're as replaceable as a lightbulb #respect<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Would you rather be down by three going into the third? #SensStrategy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Goddammit Vanek, yeah!!!! That is how you do that! WOOOOO!!! 3-0 Habs! @CanadiensMTL #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanadiensMTL Goddammit Vanek!!! Go to the net with the puck!!!!! #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>PATCHES!!!!! Finally! 2-0 Habs! @CanadiensMTL #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tell me how that douchebag Marchand can chop the stick out of a guys hands and not get a penalty!! #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanadiensMTL Boom! The #GhostsOfTheForum finally showed up in this series! #PuckLuck 1-0 Habs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanadiensMTL OK boys, giv'er! Chase 'em back to Boston! #DontWaitTakeIt #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanadiensMTL Pacioretty! #1sthabsgoal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TSNBobMcKenzie @HockeyCanada I'm available for the job. #IWantToRunHockeyCanada<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was one of the weirdest goals ever. Puck went off three Rangers players before going into their own net! #Weirdness<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxjacobsen Hard-hitting playoff hockey, goalies on their game, chances at both ends, can't complain about that #ThatsHockey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanadiensMTL Back at it on Saturday boys...Rask isn't having that game every night #10ToGo #Hard60Minutes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxjacobsen That was a great game! Didn't end the way I'd have liked but a great playoff hockey game either way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanadiensMTL  Bournival has been all over the puck tonight. #KeepAtItSon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanadiensMTL Happy the goalposts are wearing red in this one! #GoodToBeLucky #LuckyToBeGood<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanadiensMTL Alright Patches, you're due for another winner! #Hard20Minutes coming up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanadiensMTL Bournival needs to get into better shooting positions, puck's finding him tonight #PuckLuck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bloody hell...I'm sick and tired of hearing everybody and their dog whine about NHL officials #NothingButExcuses<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Habs win! #10ToGo #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boom! @BGALLY17 kills everybody! #SitDownSon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But every time that #douchebag Brad Marchand gets knocked down, I grow a little happier!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Milan Lucic is quickly devolving into one of the dirtiest players in hockey.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxjacobsen Very few fights in playoff hockey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanadiensMTL That is how you weather the storm! #JesusPrice 3-0 Habs!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanadiensMTL PK!!!! Holy shit, what a goal! #KillerDeke #LeftHimForDead 2-0 Habs! #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sportsnet Happy to see Neely's stand. These racist Boston fans need to look up one name: Willie O'Ree #LearnSomething<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JaegerWalter @DarrenDreger You need to watch a replay, puck's in well before any contact, and initial contact is a Bruins Dman in any case<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanadiensMTL Boom!!!! PK on the PP in OT! #GoHabsGo #11ToGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanadiensMTL PK needs to lay off that #AssTorpedo hit tonight...missing and getting caught way to much<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Man, what a liability Fleury is in goal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome ...up 4-2 in the 3rd tonight...Fucale pulled in G2&amp;3, gave up 3 on 4 shots in both games...backup Darveau started tonight<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HFXMooseheads Wow...this is going to create a problem if the Moose win tonight with Darveau going the distance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxjacobsen Ahh yes, Scottish line dancing, always a toss up between that and watching hockey this time of year #LordOfTheHaggisDance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxjacobsen Might have been more so if I hadn't had 1.5 eyes on the computer where the Habs game was streaming! #DoubleHockeyNight<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jaxjacobsen It was fairly awful actually...Moose fell apart early, VDO fell apart late. At least hfx showed some heart late...#finally<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayOnrait @Raptors Why? Did someone toss Vinsanity into the woodchipper? #TooMuch?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jesse Lussier!!!! @HFXMooseheads Took a note from Habs Pacioretty and scores his first playoff goal to win it! @ashleyjmorton @ecologyfunkes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HFXMooseheads Job's not done yet lads! #GoWinIt #GoMooseGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HFXMooseheads Finally the boys are showing some desperation! #GoMooseGo @ashleyjmorton @ecologyfunkes @jtmacdougall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tisshe Good time for Patches first playoff goal!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sweep! #12ToGo #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EastlinkMattB Why does Ducharme insist on sticking with Ashley? He's completely upset the offensive chemistry for the Moose this series<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HFXMooseheads Is there any good reason to have Ashley in the line-up? All he's done is upset the offence we had in the first two rounds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HFXMooseheads Darveau time again...Drouin, Ehlers, D-men, you guys miss the plane to Val D'Or? @jtmacdougall @ecologyfunkes @ashleyjmorton<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Habs are all over the place tonight! #Electric @CanadiensMTL #GoHabsGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bloody hell, can Ginette Reno sing the shit out of O Canada or what?!?! @CanadiensMTL #SheMeantThatOne #BestEver<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jtmacdougall Hmm, interesting... #LetMeThink<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So much for Matt Cooke's rehabilitation from Dirty-player-ism! Nice knee ya goon #StanleyCupPlayoffs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanadiensMTL Habs win! Outstanding effort through three games, keep it going! #GoHabsGo #13ToGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tisshe Hockey stick pole vault #NewOlympicSport @jtmacdougall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HFXMooseheads @domhockey17 VDO has a wall in the middle of the ice. Cross ice stuff not working...put big bodies in front, pucks to the net<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ashleyjmorton @HFXMooseheads Very negative fans in general...no positive energy at all, it's all "ref you suck"...should be #Go Moose Go<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CanadiensMTL 2 nights after poor starts from PK and Price, they're in the three stars...impressive W tonight! #GoHabsGo #14ToGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kristers Gudlevskis in goal for @TBLightning v @CanadiensMTL...great Latvian Olympian that nearly derailed Canada's gold medal run!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jtmacdougall @marymcbride @ashleyjmorton @ecologyfunkes Playoff OT makes for sleepy girls! #StanleyCup  http://t.co/rhKSl5Na66<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Man, when you get beyond the first OT period it can get weird<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Jesus...so much for that #BluesWin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome This has the feel of a game that could go on til Saturday #StanleyCupPlayoffs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tsnjamesduthie MacKinnon...only one pick...right it down<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HFXMooseheads @Mackinnon9 Solid play by Nate there to set up the equalizer #StanleyCupPlayoffs @jtmacdougall @ashleyjmorton @ecologyfunkes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SportsCentre Because this won't at all end in disaster<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jtmacdougall @ashleyjmorton @ecologyfunkes @HFXMooseheads Resting up for Friday #GoMooseGo  http://t.co/vl8oL9xnuD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jtmacdougall @ashleyjmorton @CanadiensMTL Actually Avery's keeping the @HFXMooseheads jersey warm on the other couch!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rather mediocre game from Price, but dominating effort by @CanadiensMTL on the road #HabsWin #15ToGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boom! #HabsWin #GhostsOf1993<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome A lot of talk of TB's inexperience tonight, showing in OT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Habs need to put this away soon before TB gets a lucky one<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HealyPredicts Come on, your glove was never THAT good! ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome One game! You can have those two points back if you like ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome ...I'm sure the Sens got their share of calls too if you're making that point<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome Come on man, the calls aren't always right but in the long run it evens out...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome @NHL I hope you're just trolling man!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Overtime, game 1...Let's hope some of that Habs OT magic #GhostsOf1993<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome @NHL Holy shit guys, wait for Pittsburgh to actually lose before blaming the refs #PlayoffHockey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Congrats #Halifax on giving an advert firm $200,000 for an ambiguous new logo and weak two-word slogan. Roads and nurses are fine I'm sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @TSN @darekmoreau @AngrySensGnome That being said, Moreau would have some Brady-loving-pals here! #SmackTalkinEverybody<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @TSN @darekmoreau I have nothing against Cros and Mac, but realistically, how many NS folk would be PIT/COL fans?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @TSN @darekmoreau Otherwise I'm sure your referring to the bandwagon Crosby and MacKinnon fans #HabsSinceBirth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @TSN @darekmoreau Not likely, NS has a sick fascination with all teams Boston...includes the Pats...think about that #gag<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Get on the bandwagon buddy #TeamCanada<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @TSN @darekmoreau Come on man, Habs are de facto team Canada now...plus CBJ will be a better story when they KO PIT in six<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marymcbride @rystanman Just throw in a casual "I just can't stop this guy from coding" comment...but that sounds odd from a nurse :p<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sportsnet @mc79hockey If 2nd in your div with 16-17 games to go, now with 5 left, you need A LOT of help to get in...it's a collapse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BSommerhalder Whatever works to make the games infinitely longer and unwatchable! #WakeMeUpInOctober<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Yet they can't even pull out a single point to take advantage...it will be a miracle if they make the P-Os now #WheelsAreOff<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome It's almost mind-blowing to me that before last night, the Leafs have been given help by all of the teams their racing...1/2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jtmacdougall @DurtyNellysPub And I've informed the barmaid that when I get two fingers from the bottom she can start pulling a fresh pint!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rockalittle @HFXMooseheads That's what happens when you play that way. He has one role, and it's not scoring. #NoSurprise<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Kessel scores for the Leafs then tries to kill himself by running into the net...come on it's not THAT bad. #ItIsThatBad #FallingSpringLeafs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chronicleherald Antler up! #mooseselfie @jtmacdougall @ashleyjmorton @mlscote  http://t.co/1iQqLH3ZG2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gadus07 Nice! #BruceKnowsSports<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rystanman Probably 17 or 18 years since I've seen Richard but his personality hasn't changed...and he was a f**king tough hockey player!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rystanman One of the guys on the Midnight Shadow is my cousin, grew up with another one, and the skipper was a hockey coach/drinking buddy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fs1otoole And for all those heathens desecrating the juice of the barley, may their green puke be voluminous #StPatricksDay #Guinness4All<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@moynihan7112 Good job, Danny "I've had enough of this shit" Moynihan steps in! #StickingUpForTheLads @ashleyjmorton @mlscote @jqentastic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Apparently Thursday night's alright for fighting too @HFXMooseheads @jqentastic @ashleyjmorton @mlscote #EltonJohnHockeySong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Montreal wins the division #WriteItDown<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Good pickup for you guys in Hemsky...GM #1stStar is Habs Bergevin though #StolenVanek<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sid and Toews chirping each other less than a week after combining for Olympic gold...f**k I love Canadian hockey! #WeAreWinter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TSNBobMcKenzie Back2back tricks, 40+ goals, could @HFXMooseheads Nik Ehlers be pulling a George Jefferson for #2014NHLDraft? #MovinOnUp<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gadus07 This arsehole is showing up in the news way too often for a team that's doing fairly well this season #wanker<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"@Sportsnet: No rest for the weary: Leafs to lean heavily on Kessel, JVR down the stretch" That would work if they were playing v. Czech Rep<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @darekmoreau @AngrySensGnome @ashleyjmorton But we don't qualify for #WC2014 so we're a failure? Come on man!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @darekmoreau @AngrySensGnome @ashleyjmorton ...USA has 10x the population, probably 100x the wealth, only 3 more medals<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @darekmoreau @AngrySensGnome @ashleyjmorton That's a bit harsh isn't it? Our 25 medals in #Sochi2014 speaks to that...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jqentastic @22_Minutes Baha! Luckily my pile was more of a mogul than a mountain for Monday #SeeWhatIDidThere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Dear @HockeyCanada naysayers, hope those sour grapes taste good to you, but you have 4 years to wash the taste out of your mouth #GoCanadaGo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yessir! "@tsnjamesduthie: With all 4 golds in curling and hockey, Canada re-establishes world domination in beer sports."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darekmoreau @AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome @ashleyjmorton Mission accomplished! #GoCanadaGo #GoldMedalGame<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darekmoreau @AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome Yeah @ashleyjmorton is with me watching and we were saying the same<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Holy Jesus dude, enough with the excuses. Everybody plays the same format.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau @AngryPensGnome I could care less who's in there if we can finish it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darekmoreau not sure I'd even call it D first, not like they sat back...solid two way game and if they could bring that on Sunday...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darekmoreau @AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome Crazy...never would have guessed a 1-0 score. #GoCanadaGo #DefenceWinsChampionships<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome What a game man! Offence didn't blow the doors off but, they gave the USA nothing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome @darekmoreau Absolutely flawless game by Canada...don't think I've ever seen our guys own a game like that<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Exactly my thoughts on big ice...A lesson in why bigger ice isn't better.  http://t.co/fdAIy8W9RU<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeamGB @CDNOlympicTeam Very classy and gracious opponents...anybody knowing curling would agree the Murdoch rink is one of the world's best<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Classy "@TeamGB: Congratulations @CDNOlympicTeam. Superb #curling effort today and throughout #Sochi2014. Deserved #doublegold"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darekmoreau That was a great one for The Great One! I remember being a little shocked, and in total agreement, with what he said.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Golden girls indeed! "@tsnjamesduthie: Medal Standings if you only count women. #Canadiangirlsrule  http://t.co/3ZR1ZVyUHQ"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @AmherstAleHouse Might as well be, USA needed a miracle to win that semi too. #YouHadAGoodRun<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmherstAleHouse @AngryPensGnome Wow...whoever came up with this has some serious f**king issues...enjoy your shitty beer and freedom fries<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unbelieveable heart shown by the #TeamCanada women! Unreal intensity to tie it after the linesman nearly ended it for Canada.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau So I guess in that regard, history will repeat itself #MemoriesOfUtah<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau Just for the record, it is my belief that Canada will come away the victors over USA, 5-2.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jqentastic Baha!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau ...tall order for any team.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau You know exactly what I mean Wilke..20 that rarely play together and give them 6 games for gold<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau ...if you take 20 guys and throw them together, it doesn't always equate to gold.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau ...over 50% of the players in the best league in the world are Canadian, that's a fact...but...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau Not sure what you want to hear here...yes, we are the best hockey nation in the world...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau Neither the Team Canada of 1952, 2002, nor 2010 will be playing on Friday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @darekmoreau @AngrySensGnome Sorry meant to say if the forwards can get one early...same point!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @darekmoreau @AngrySensGnome ...And if our offence gets one early, I don't think the US can play two-way hockey with us<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @darekmoreau @AngrySensGnome But the US has not played a D like Canada's yet...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @darekmoreau @AngrySensGnome All the underdog or team to beat shit is oit the window in a one game knockout<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Oh well, win is a win at this point. I think the close games will help Canada gel...and the scoring up front will come.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome No doubt ref was in perfect position...  maybe he was so focussed on the puck he didn't see the hand on top of it! :p<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Unreal how even NHL refs lose it in international competition!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @latviahockey Hats off to Ted Nolan and the Latvians...A+ effort!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darekmoreau @AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome All of which were in a better state in Russia in '72! :p<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome Screw Ovi...favorite Ovi moment was when CAN made him cry at the wjhc a few years back<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome Finns are going to be a tough out...Russia just shows the difference between "group of stars" and "team"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome @gadus07 @darekmoreau @jwinks11 Geeze...Holding onto something there Wilke?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just saw the shootout from the USA/RUS game today...TJ Oshie is a pond hockey maniac. #KidCanDangle<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome I think it may as well be a coin flip...but I'd bet on Price, he seemed to have the edge coming in<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watt's def of fighting: Catching punches with my face. @jqentastic @ashleyjmorton @kesmorton @mlscote @astounding202<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gadus07 Hopefully Mike Ashley will be next to go...sick of being Europes farm team<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darekmoreau @natewilke @gadus07 I guess so, but one doesn't care about it, don't waste your time talking about it...that's my opinion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@natewilke @gadus07 @darekmoreau why the hell's everybody hating on the sb this year?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bell_LetsTalk Just saw on @TSN_Sports nearly 60 million tweets, calls, and shares...awesome! #BellLetsTalk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@gerrydee This is officially my favorite tweet of the day...if he knocked up Miley Cyrus, the circle would be complete!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau @gadus07 Team building has always been CAN's MO. Can they gel in a short tourney format?...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau @gadus07 For me Giroux is out because we need a right-handed faceoff specialist, ie Bergeron<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau @mlscote @ashleyjmorton @gadus07 My thoughts exactly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @darekmoreau @mlscote @ashleyjmorton @gadus07 @AngryPensGnome Agreed. Stamkos is a big ? too. Only 3+mos since broken leg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darekmoreau @mlscote @ashleyjmorton @AngrySensGnome @gadus07 @AngryPensGnome Thought the StLouis-Yzerman connection would get him there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darekmoreau @mlscote @ashleyjmorton @AngrySensGnome @gadus07 @AngryPensGnome First thought was that this could easily be the 2018 team too!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ashleyjmorton @mlscote @astounding202 @jqentastic Holy crap, #big2points was what my old coach Bob Rogers would say at gametime #memorylane<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ashleyjmorton @HFXMooseheads @mlscote @astounding202 @jqentastic I kind of feel they need the W to make a statement. #big2points<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TSNBobMcKenzie Could tonight's matchup with @ArmadaBLB be a crystal ball for the Mem Cup champ @HFXMooseheads season?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I feel like tonight's game could be a crystal ball for the @HFXMooseheads season @ashleyjmorton @mlscote @astounding202 @jqentastic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @marymcbride You should put that on a t-shirt! Or on the back of your Sens jersey. #willtherealstanleystandup<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marymcbride @AngrySensGnome I know, eh? #WTFstanley<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome Jesus! You must really hate this guy! The text character cheerleaders were a nice touch #WTFstanley<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So weird seeing @Mackinnon9 in an Avs jersey! Good luck kid!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ashleyjmorton @jqentastic @mlscote @HFXMooseheads Longest game ever! Fight every few minutes, nobody wanted to score in the shootout :p<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jqentastic @mlscote @ashleyjmorton BC v.HFX: Elton John had it right, Saturday night IS alright for fighting! @HFXMooseheads #dropem<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...but the ref was nice enough to come over and explain the rule to him #standupzebra @mlscote @ashleyjmorton<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>...and then Darveau gets a penalty for playing the puck outside the trapezoid #welcometotheshowkid @mlscote @ashleyjmorton<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TSNBobMcKenzie This just cuts right through you. Extremely sad and tragic thing. Condolences to Jordan's family at an impossibly hard time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelFarber3 Agreed, if A is stoic and B is stoic-ish. The PGA should check to make sure that a robot didn't win the Wannamaker.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Self-correction: 2016 is the year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome The USGA has banned anchored putters for 2014 I think. I believe the R&amp;A have done the same. Not 100% on the timeframe tho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @gadus07 @PTI @darekmoreau @peluco52 @sgheffernan Probably the only place outside of Europe that's always big-tourney-ready<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @gadus07 @PTI @darekmoreau @peluco52 @sgheffernan Don't have to sell me on that. Confed Cup was a nasty eye-opener.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gadus07 @PTI @darekmoreau @peluco52 @sgheffernan To the US I'm guessing!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome ...this is about player development and using the tools that we have to serve our young players best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome This has nothing to do with the national team. We will always be able include 2-3 world class goalies for competition...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Dude, not about making goalies look good, it's about developing better prospects. CHL is the top dev league for U20's<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @darekmoreau @AngrySensGnome Young goalies need to face the best shooters, not the best goalies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darekmoreau @AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome And for the most part those coaches are in the CHL, so why deny our kids that opportunity?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngrySensGnome @AngryPensGnome My point exactly...and it's just a small step. Systems for ID'ing young prospects will also likely change<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome Not a lack of opportunity but it's a matter of getting more guys involved at the highest level<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome But obviously Hockey Canada has identified a gap in the last few years in the junior ranks. There's a lot of steps to a fix<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Granted Finland has turned out some good goalies and coaches but Canada has had the cream of the crop for a LONG time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Dude, the CHL didn't make this decision overnight. And why would Europe even care if they're developing their own guys?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome And I would argue strongly that Rask was a middle-of-the-road prospect that "learned" to play under NHL coaching.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome If this were true, the CHL would consider US players imports, but they don't<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Your point being what? There's no effect on euro goalies playing in Europe and no impact on them coming to the NHL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Historically and statistically speaking, that is untrue. And the Cdn guys will rebound #pardonthepun It's happened before<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PineRider30 @Fucale31 @Mackinnon9 @jodrouin27 Everyone plays a part buddy, your name's on the cup too! Can't take that away!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome Not jingoism to use our own tools to develop young Canadian goalies. If we banned euro players altogether, then I'd agree<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome And why send a 16 year old goalie to Europe when the CHL is the best junior age development league in the world?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome This strengthens my point actually...Why give away CHL roster spots to "mediocre" euro goalies when we can develop our kids?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome We have a serious goalie development issue right now in Canada. This move isn't the magic cure but it's a step.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome I have to agree with the CHL on this one given the limited number of roster spots for goalies in major junior.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @darekmoreau @AngrySensGnome @gadus07 @BelleyRenald Cages? C'mon man! It's not peewee hockey!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@darekmoreau @AngryPensGnome @AngrySensGnome @gadus07 @BelleyRenald Not far enough Moreau? Would you prefer goalie masks for all???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @darekmoreau @AngrySensGnome @gadus07 @BelleyRenald The vote is in, grandfathered visors for new guys...thoughts?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #NHL competition committee has reached a consensus to make visors mandatory for all players entering the league.  http://t.co/HfKBBC5H5D"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tomjc43 @Sportsnet Not at all a question of civil rights. If you don't like the rule, you don't have to play in the NHL...that simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AngryPensGnome @darekmoreau @AngrySensGnome @gadus07 @BelleyRenald Hockey doesn't suck, the economics of NHL hockey sucks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HFXMooseheads Dream season lads...congrats! See you next season!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy @Sportsnet covered the Memorial Cup but including the anthem singer that forgot the words in your wrap montage was totally classless<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ashleyjmorton @mlscote Darcy Ashley is playing some #hardminutes in this game. Awesome game for him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HFXMooseheads @mlscote @ashleyjmorton Got away with one there...come on Abeltshauser, smarten up in your own end<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ashleyjmorton @mlscote @ecologyfunkes Nice! The folks here in Rigaud didn't get the "Get to da choppa!" cheer! ;)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HFXMooseheads OK boys, you're already heroes, go out there and leave it all on the ice, and you'll be legends!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@natewilke @darekmoreau @rystanman Damn boys, do I ever miss these discussions over beers with you all! Remember Lebron the soccer goalie??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@natewilke Amen to that brother. Parity is an issue in the NHL no doubt, and a full arena does help attract the top talent to drive parity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@natewilke I'd be all for that, but you know full well hockey in PHX isn't football in GB. Which is why I hope it sticks in WPG this time!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@natewilke @darekmoreau @rystanman I'd put a team in Mexico City if I thought it would work! :P<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@natewilke @darekmoreau @rystanman What's the point of moving a team if you'll have to move it again in 5-10 years? Could KC sustain a team?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@natewilke @darekmoreau @rystanman PHX move to Quebec exacerbates the conference alignment problem though. Seattle anyone?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@natewilke @darekmoreau @rystanman I'd like to see the 'Yotes moved to a sustainable, hockey-relevant locale. Prefer Canada,  maybe pac-nw<|endoftext|>
