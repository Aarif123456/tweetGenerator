<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden didn't downplay H1N1, &amp; from that experience Obama &amp; #JoeBiden created a playbook &amp; task force to deal with future pandemics.   #Trump tossed the playbook &amp; task force, then lied about #COVID19.

<|startoftext|>@ShelleyChilds1 @h8Wankmaggot45 Adding that what you say is probably true,  it wasn't quite what I was referring to.

<|startoftext|>@Getsmart4 My guess is that he was trying to avoid issuing pardons by trying trying to quietly get shorter sentences.

<|startoftext|>@IlhanMN @AmericaLee Oh sure...next you'll tell us that the #GOP is trying to take away #Healthcare coverage for #PreExistingConditions &amp; removing access to food stamps from millions during the holiday season!  Oh wait...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RepMcClintock @ThisWeekABC @ABC; Please ask @RepMcClintock why he hadn't held an in-person #townhall in over 2 years. Ask why, if he is truly representing the constituents of #CA04, is he too afraid to meet with them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyceWhiteVance #WWJD  Definitely take away food from poor people.  The churches would protest this but they're too busy advocating for non-existent medical procedures on women.  #FakeChristians<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MarriedFitz86 @Jwheels208 @girlbomb3 I'm betting that you stayed in the United States all during the time period of 2009-2017 (unless you were in Russia).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@VZWSupport; I am on the west side of the Sierra Nevada mountains in California. Why is my phone yet again showing the time as being 2 hours ahead of the actual time?  The phone's time must be accurate in order to make the alarm clock app useful.  https://t.co/HCrdomMHb6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amjoyshow I'm wondering if this is a byproduct of so many people leaving the #GOP.  It's just the 1%'era &amp; racists left in the party.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OregonProgress For me the best part of an indoor rowing machine is how well it works on cardio. No other exercise machine gets close to how quickly it get you out of breath as well as elevates the pulse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CIAspygirl You mean that guy who had to copy Warren Zevon and Lynyrd Skynyrd to get heard on the radio?  The washed-up dude who has never had his own original material make it into the Billboard Top 100?  That piece of fecal matter?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nanettema Yes, it was a bad shooting by the police. But this was from over 4 years ago. The family of Jeremy McDole was awarded $1.5 million by a jury nearly 3 years ago. Why are you rehashing this tragedy again, especially since you're not an American?<|endoftext|>
