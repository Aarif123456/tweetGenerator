<|startoftext|>@Difur787 @IanByrneMP Help me please, what was done to prevent a @uklabour victory? Who did it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanByrneMP Can you help me please. In the analysis of the 2019 election failure for @uklabour what are the main factors that you think led to that failure?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BBCPolitics So that's a yes then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sime0nStylites I fear that whenever a deal is done it won't happen until Johnson is gone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>YES! THIS<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ladyounge @BigBadBurrow @pmdfoster There is no doubt that data is a big problem, one that may over time be sorted, but right now is sadly to far down the list.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyBird92300 @BigBadBurrow @pmdfoster I disagree. US alone is a federal trade bloc, but also in Ustr, India and China are big enough alone (and with less gravity for Europe). EU was about peace, then trade was added, and then Union. Different reasons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sturdyAlex Important thread<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyBird92300 @BigBadBurrow @pmdfoster I think that's the price of a full access FTA with the largest bloc in the world.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>True<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigBadBurrow @pmdfoster Commitment is reciprocal is important.  EU has never had to deal with a 3rd country the size and proximity of the UK before. It would help is the UK govt would explain why EU standards are considered too high for the UK? Which regs and stds do they want to diverge from? #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you, a point rarely made. In addition, when the cost of the punishments are discussed, no one talks about the prize in the table, namely single market access, it's huge!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Gosh, that's awful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My only glimmer of hope in all this is that it might make the Tory party unelectable for a generation. But I think that also depends on how @UKLabour react as the #BrexitReality unfolds. #brexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@socialtechno @RobertCraig3 @SpinningHugo @UKLabour I agree, except I think the dash for growth budget of '72 started the end of Keynesian economics in the UK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulRobson63 @RobertCraig3 @SpinningHugo I agree, but for me that cannot be a reason for not utilising his ideas. Do you not think it was the adoption of NeoLib economic thinking in '72 under Heath that damaged the long boom dynamics that had been working well just 10 yrs earlier under Macmillan?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertCraig3 @SpinningHugo I was born in 1962 and I can't say I feel as if I was left to clear up after the big spending of the '45 @UKLabour govt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulRobson63 @RobertCraig3 @SpinningHugo I disagree and would point towards the teachings of JMKeynes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertCraig3 @SpinningHugo I rather like the thinking of JMKeynes on this, now is the time for a govt to build its way out of these doldrums. Do you not think this could replicate the '45 long boom?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the type of economic policy thinking that appears to elude the #austerity loving #tories and #LibDems.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPJHodges No, we're not agreed on that, right?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Oooo, this is good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jdportes Because their neolib experiment, started by Heath, continued by Thatcher, taken to an illogical height by Cameron/May is now unravelling very fast. Stand by for the return of the master #keynes @UKLabour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Important development, Johnson/Cummings will stop at nothing to take this election. Just as they did in parliament, all rules will be bent and stretched.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am continually amazed at people being completely amazed at how heartless and calculating the Tory party is. They, the Tories, don't give a toss about anyone other than their rich mates.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@g_gosden @Jim_Cornelius Next he'll be telling us it's only coincidence that the UK terrorist threat level has suddenly reduced just before the election.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Otto_English On Saturday there'll be 288 Tory MPs on one side, most of the other MPs on the other side plus at least 1000000+ people outside. Keep the faith.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very useful thread that really helps to clear the fog. I concur, this is a very poor outcome. #brexit #Stingray<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevebimpson @DanielCreminUK I disagree, it is not a change of law, but a change of precedent, wholly within SC jurisdiction, but not applied by HoL.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I concur<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good point well made, history will judge harshly those that give away the status quo.  https://t.co/CbZwUo6um6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpinningHugo True, i dont think I phrased it well, we have not created these right independently for a long time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpinningHugo We could do, but if we've effectively outsourced the creation of these particular rights for the last 40 odd years, why should we diverge from our closest friends and neighbours? I can't see any centre/right govt leaping forward to improve them, only diminish them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nigel_Farage Nice try, but, as you well know, this is a lie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpinningHugo Easy, on Saturday, amend the law so that #RevokeA50 becomes the default position instead of crashing out on WTO terms.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@krishgm @TheMehOffice Or #RevokeA50<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stevebimpson @DanielCreminUK Are you really relying on just comments from a pro right wing think tank, please read around the subject.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I concur. Don't let the bastards grind you down. It's important that MPs hold the line for a good deal, not just any deal. #brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Q. Why doesn't parliament use SO24 to change the law so that if no deal is found then we automatically #RevokeA50 rather than crash out with no deal? Surely that would focus minds. #Brexit @GuitarMoog @StevePeers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Stand by to be blown away..... What trade deals has the UK already got in place for a no deal #Brexit?  https://t.co/5yWu7TOpIQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GuitarMoog 10 mins in the sin bin for that one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acgrayling News services can deal with this by refusing to report unless the source is happy to be named.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WindsockBS @JGForsyth Hmm, doesn't work that way. They will block Farage, or he will not get through the financial vetting process. We will have to have a FTA with the EU, so shouldn't piss them off too much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pmdfoster @LeaveEUOfficial I am ashamed to be on the same island as these people. If you are in the #EU and reading this, we are not all like this. Most of us love the EU and would like to stay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are many deals possible, it's the Johnson deal that's impossible. After 3 years Tories should step aside and let another deal emerge, probably Norway style.  https://t.co/xAFAjzPxTK<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jim_Cornelius Nice, and now I've retweeted that one too.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The irony of all this silly militaristic #brexit language is that it's the great European project that has stopped there being another war in Europe where we might have used it  and saved people like me (b. 1962) from the horror suffered by previous generations.

<|startoftext|>@BlatentLie @TheMehOffice @jeremycorbyn Please explain the question?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidallengreen Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMehOffice But for Brits this is socialism, wrongly identified, and therefore British Socialism. Do you think Corbyn could achieve anything more than what Attlee did?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMehOffice The utter confusion between DS &amp; SD is, as you say, commonplace. I argue that for most Brits their only understanding of socialism is the '45 Attlee govt. He achieved 21% public ownership, but was well wedded to Keynes, and therefore a SD......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMehOffice I think this is sloppy shorthand for what might usefully be called British Socialism. Can you point us towards a useful definition of socialism?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@upthepipe @tom_watson @OwenSmith_MP @UKLabour must draw in support from many areas and views, moderates and hardliners.

<|startoftext|>Will Cummings be in the gallery tomorrow holding up cue cards for Johnson?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you think parliament will be like university challenge tomorrow? Johnson, looking queezy, looks to the speaker and mumbles "nominate Cummings".<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidallengreen May the force be with us. #RebelAlliance #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I concur<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wednesday will be a huge day for currency speculators. I wonder if any of them have links to the conservative party, like Rees-Mogg. #Brexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IanDunt Indeed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickBoles To make the rebels feel wobbly enough not to vote against him this week, because this week is the week. If Johnson/ Cummings can get through this week without parliament striking, it'll be a victory for them. #Brexit #StopTheCoup<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CaerphillyL @DanielJHannan Silly. Of course not, you misconstrue my entire meaning. If we share an army, then no member can use it against another, the single biggest reason the EU project was founded for, to stop European war.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaerphillyL @DanielJHannan Excellent. An #EU army prevents internal conflict while making the EU stronger, or do you think the 75k strong UK forces enough? Can't even protect our own shipping in the gulf!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Barrybritish @pondlifetwit @Thomasgordon01 @DanielJHannan No.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaerphillyL @DanielJHannan Hmmm, constructive argument. I don't think you'll get 17.4m again, now the #Brexit lies are being cleared away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaerphillyL @DanielJHannan Yes, we are leaders, in every respect, in the #EU, our money makes it better for everyone. This makes the first objective of the EU happen, no more European wars, no more lost generations. #Brexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Thomasgordon01 @DanielJHannan Do they? When was that said?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidStonehous7 @DanielJHannan @SuzanneEvans1 The £39bn was negotiated with the UK govt, not plucked from the air. The EU is regularly audited, that it's not is untrue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigBadBurrow @DanielJHannan A large chunk of the £39bn is for services already used and pension payments, or do you think Brits who worked for the EU shouldn't get their pension rights?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>An FTA, any FTA, is nothing compared to the SM/CU we have with the EU. No deal, or a deal without SM/CU is crap. Tories making an FTA with US sound like a replacement for EU trade. It is not! #Brexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@clarinsqueen @EEnderinWales @WarmongerHodges @theSNP @Plaid_Cymru A very myopic reply. No one expects the SNP or PC to form a govt, but they hold sway in their respective areas and would contribute to a @UKLabour led coalition.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpillerOfTea This makes me sad, how do people come to these conclusions?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidschneider Deus ex machina shouldn't be our only hope (as it is for Johnson).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danielintheory @Andrew_Adonis @UKLabour I thought JC at the despatch box and at the Westminster rally sounded more passionate about stopping #Brexit. However, like BJ, passion alone doesn't win the war, we need a plan so clear anyone can grasp it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@upthepipe No sign of that from this angle.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JuliaLeftie @upthepipe @politicshome Thank god we find agreement, I was worried we'd never get there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaLeftie @upthepipe @politicshome Your argument suggests that the best form of government would be a continual series of referendums, I cannot share that idea. I want a rep to listen, distil and find a majority. We the public don't have the time. Unfortunately, some (many?) MPs are not up to the job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaLeftie @upthepipe @politicshome I think a MP is a rep, and therefore serves their constituents before party, but should vote for what they think is in their constituents best interest. Therefore a MP could vote to revoke A50 even if their constituents voted to leave.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaLeftie @upthepipe @politicshome You can't have it both ways. You state an MP is a delegate of the party. So when is he/she being undemocratic, when they defy their constituents, or when they defy the party?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaLeftie @upthepipe @politicshome He is isn't he, I'm glad he is loved by and in step with his constituents. He must have been a thorn in the side of the last Labour govt when he repeatedly denied the whip. Was he undemocratic for that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Long(ish) thread but well worth the time #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaLeftie @upthepipe @politicshome Not so. As an MP they should follow the party whip, but not all do all the time (see JCs record). Are they undemocratic if they disobey the whip?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you @PietEeckhout, clarity for a simple Twitter user like me is established. Why is it so hard for Tories to understand? #Brexit #GATT24<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the current climate, please ensure you read this short but crucial thread re: #Brexit and #GATT24<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaLeftie @upthepipe @politicshome An MP is a representative, not a delegate, so how can they go against the wishes of their constituents? They must do what is, in their opinion, best for them. You are misrepresenting UK politics!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DavidHenigUK Thank you @DavidHenigUK , as I understand it, unless we #RevokeArticle50 then there will be an economic hit, under any and all #Brexit situations.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B1EMW Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dianehain Viva la revolucion #Brexit #summerofdiscontent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sure you are, but just checking, supporting Richard in any way you can @BenMLake<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jacob_Rees_Mogg Silly billy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Johnson, Hunt &amp; Gove, a polylemma. Whoever wins will produce a poor govt, dead on arrival. It will fall by the autumn, either through parliamentary process, or at the hands of the people. So starts the #summerofdiscontent.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@election_data Excellent analysis, read.   #Brexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheMehOffice True, but he might be environment secretary in a Johnson cabinet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMehOffice Sadly, I fear, you're right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sime0nStylites Boris woefully out of his depth #BBCOurNextPM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They're all the children of Thatcher, neo-lib cutters. Don't ask a Tory where more social spending will come from, because it won't happen. #BBCOurNextPM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We should be allowed to have a write in candidate, I'll go with Emily Maitlis, she's doing best in this debate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And still, the most depressing thing in all of this, is that one of these idiots will get the job #BBCOurNextPM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sweet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Unwise_Trousers Correct answer but, ooooh, that's not nice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMehOffice @UB5simon It'll look very much like Cleggs Orange Book ideas on a sponge base made by Friedman, topped off with utilitarianism.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Pick me, Pick me, Pick me, Pick me, Pick me, Pick me, Pick me #C4debate<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Why didn't Gove say his weakness was coke? #C4debate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They fucked up education, now they want to be thanked for waking up and realising that. And you know what, once elected, they'll do nothing about it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MeanwhileScotia He's a posh kid, son of an admiral.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why are they all telling us education is so important after 9 years of Tory austerity that put education in the dire position it's in now! #C4debate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LorimerPam Unfair, that's all of....oh hang on, I see what you've done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why does Raab always speak directly to Rod? #C4debate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@George_Toner You've answered your own question, the EU know it's just a tool (a bit like Raab). #C4debate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If Raab says 'walk away' one more time I'll authorise the use of limited violence from Rod Stewart. #C4debate (and yes, it is Rod, check it).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Gove thinks believing hard enough will force the EU to change their minds. Pillock! #C4debate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just a bunch of posh boys playing at life. No idea, no idea what reality feels like. #C4debate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Polylemma, 5 bald men fighting over a comb #C4debate #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@charlesntnw Why?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sime0nStylites Liar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#C4debate Hunt told not to look scared, but does. Raab told to smile, but can't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you were a vegetable which vegetable would you be?  I'm going to say Dominic Raab. #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too many Tory leader candidates keep talking about no deal being ok, we'll work through it. No! It the equivalent of jumping from a plane with no parachute and thinking of something on the way down! It's not going to end well. #Brexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Watch  #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wrong, why oh why should someone like @johnredwood not understand basic economics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The most depressing thing about the #Tory leadership campaign is that one of them will win.  #brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A quick reminder, it's not too late to put the sprouts on to a low simmer ready for Christmas.   #Christmas<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good thread that helps to shine a light into the dark corners of #brexit that Tory MPs are too useless to visit.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Jordan_Rimmer @RoryStewartUK His plan is to be a continuation of May's #Brexit show. Parliament has rejected that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonlis1 Just watched the show. Yes it did, so again GATT24 is used as a fig leaf for the ERG's inability to put together a solution that holds water. #BREXIT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonlis1 did it go unchallenged by #Peston ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jordan_Rimmer @RoryStewartUK He got no plan<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Not to mention the fact that we already have a fabulous great big trade deal with our best mates the EU! Lets just remain! #RevokeArticle50<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Its v v substantial because it'll include the NHS and it wont happen under a No Deal #Brexit as congress have already stated they'll have nothing to do with anything that impacts the Good Friday Agreement.  https://t.co/PKBi2E9jac<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@katiec1314 because it caps the number of students who can attend uni. Both systems are flawed. Lets go back to educating the next generation as best we can from taxation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is true.  #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>About time @bbcnewsnight found its teeth, good job @Emmabarnett.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DavidHenigUK No<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I retweet this while not knowing whether to laugh or cry. The #Brexit party are either so callous as to happily throw NI out to achieve their goal, or so deluded as to not understand even the basics of UK politics.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Great blog, please read to understand #Brexit as it is right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pmdfoster Your thoughts on BoJo wanting to protect the party more than the country, gives Farage a peerage and brings him into his cabinet as #Brexit minister just to hoover up all the votes. Then #GE2019.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent thread that is as clear and concise as an OS Explorer. #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True  #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I concur  #brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stephenpollard @brexitparty_uk @Channel4News I do hope the other broadcasts do boycott @brexitparty_uk events. Remove their oxygen of publicity until they allow press scrutiny.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Are you watching @UKLabour, are you?  #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pswidlicki @StevePeers @stephenkb I concur.  #Brexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>True<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I, sir, concur  #Brexit #EUelections2019<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If IMHO @UKLabour we're to do what Alex Sobel MP proposes (final paragraph) then Labour would find themselves in the driving seat regarding #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeftFootFwd Good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanDunt a little more edgy than "Bollocks to #Brexit"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Independent @jdportes This simply cannot be true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonmbutterworth @mrjamesob Are you talking about his departure from UKIP?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@botturi_chiara @DrSueOosthuizen I love a motte and bailey, we (not me and you but the nation) should build a new one, living history.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent blog that maps the current landscape well. I agree that the underlying issue isn't #brexit, for me it's a public revultion of neo-liberal policies, started in 1979.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeHatherall Hmm, poor, weak and hollow analysis. Come on now, it's not hard to be grown up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mbx_1 Indeed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndreaMoignard @Nigel_Farage Shouty man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mummygirl She allows Farage to spout whatever he want without much challenge. The biggest gob gets heard the most. Not a debate!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ADreamOfSiam I think that's shouted down<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lewis_goodall Indeed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oooph indeed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DVATW Tit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@upthepipe Indeed, must refocus on UKs issues following Tory austerity. Can only truly happen once #Brexit is over. 2nd Ref does that. Remember, austerity is a choice, it didn't have to be this way.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>"Mr McDonnell agreed that the message from the polls was to "get on with it" and come to an agreement over Brexit quickly". No! How? The message is clearly to remain or have the softest #Brexit possible. What planet are these people on?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterBartle4 @Jim_Cornelius @LibDems No<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Are we happy for @UKLabour to bail out the piss poor #Tory #Brexit deal? No we are not! You want my vote? You gotta work for it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@0Calamity @BarryGardiner He talks about a compromise, but it's barely any better that what the Tories offer. We need a full fat CU &amp; SM to keep ourselves afloat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Andrew_Adonis It does come from the conservatives bright shiny penny that is Matt Hancock.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I, sir, concur  #brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you for talking sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigGingerYeti @LuckyHeronSay @UKLabour If we want the the EU to control our external tariffs and we stay aligned to EU regulations, but we chose to leave so we have no say in these, why? Why not just stay, and help shape the EU by having a say in how the CU &amp; SM work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigGingerYeti @LuckyHeronSay @UKLabour Sorry but no, @UKLabour want 'a' CU and close regulatory alignment, that doesn't do the job. You need the real thing to make it all work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AbiWilson2 Nice, but tenuous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveMBall That Fiona Bruce women's on every week!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LuckyHeronSay While I want to agree, right now I think #Brexit is the only issue. If we don't remain in the CU &amp; SM, the UK economy will crash. EU far from perfect, but best changed from within.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BigGingerYeti @LuckyHeronSay I fear his policies will not work outside the EU. They are great policies, but if we leave @UKLabour will spend its entire first term, and probably its second, firefighting the chaos of being outside SM &amp; CU.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesColdwellUK @Jim_Cornelius It's a sad day when the Venn circles of #brexit and everything else @UKLabour stand for stop overlapping. But for me it is so critical that we remain that I cannot support Labour. I am lucky though, I can vote Plaid Cymru.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaxAlbedo @upthepipe @UKLabour FFS, get a life you lot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He goes on to say "we are where we are", how dare he dismiss the #tory mismanagement of policing as if it where inevitable. incompetent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NickHurdUK says on #wato that knife crime is bad because of no money for police post 2008 crash. Lie! #austerity was a #tory choice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeftFootFwd This, unfortunately, is wrong, and CU only plans are flawed. A CU without a SM doesn't work on almost every level #Brexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sciolism007 @UKChange What a silly tweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Delightful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeBennett2903 Your MP is a representative, not a delegate. In voting for them you ask them to listen to all the arguments and come to the best outcome. If your MP thinks #Brexit is a shit show, now the facts are fully known, then yes, it is OK to vote differently to the referendum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeBennett2903 If parliament changes the course of #Brexit then that is good, as it's being done by our elected reps. T May tried to get a bigger majority for her version of Brexit at the last election and lost her majority, because the bulk of the country don't agree with her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeBennett2903 Again, you don't like what's happened, but it was in order, therefore it stands.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great lion @AbiWilson2 (sorry, wrong day etc). As they say, the lion shall lie down with the lamb, but the lion will get a better night's sleep.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeBennett2903 Disgraceful in your eyes fine. I'm sorry you feel that way. Unconstitutional no. It was completely legal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeeBennett2903 Get a grip man, this is what #Brexit supporters wanted most. Sovereignty of parliament over EU. This is it happening, your elected MPs doing their thing!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>First past the post elections generally produce strong govts. Thank god it didn't this time, or else we would be leaving the EU with the shite Tory deal. We can only hope now the Corbyn shows wisdom at this critical point. If he does, it could bode well for @UKLabour future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MazzucatoM I concur. One of the worst economic performances of any UK govt since WWII. did no one learn anything from Keynes?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll buy that. #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeAreThe52 or, of course, revoke A50 to make sure we stay in forever. By far the wisest choice. #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why?!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@davidallengreen In, where do I pay?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is true, like really really true. Don't be fooled that a Customs Union solves all our #Brexit woes, it doesn't.  We must have membership of the Single  Market as well if we are to flourish economically.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Indeed  #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If this passed it'll make the problems of 2008 look small.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is excellent #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That chasm opened a long time ago. Something to do with promising one style of #Brexit, knowing full well it could never be delivered. Liars and cheats, that's why no one trust's this govt.  https://t.co/OOR0917LAh  via @GoogleNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peston @GuitarMoog @theresa_may A crap deal made doubly worse by being a blind #Brexit, therefore we will be entirely at the mercy of the next Tory PM (chosen by less than 100k Tory party members). MPs who support this will be harshly judged by history.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonworth I concur  #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Keir is right, yet more underhand moves trying to get through a deal no one likes or wants. #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeAreThe52 But now he knows that would cost jobs. He, unlike you, doesn't want UK citizens to be poorer.  #Brexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoWolffBSG @SpinningHugo The EU is far from perfect, but it has brought peace to it's members for decades. #Brexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NeilDotObrien @PaulGoodmanCH Quite right, unlike the PMs deal where we give up all hope of a prosperous future while being consumed alive by China and the US.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@StevePeers @NickBoles Savaged by the 17th century<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeAreThe52 MPs tonight will get the chance to vote on what Brexit option they want.  Any customs union keeps us trading partners with Brussels.  It is NOT Brexit!  #Brexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@davidallengreen OMG! Options A, B, N, O &amp; P all still require the sacrifice of a live unicorn in the main chamber to get them through. Discount these. Options F &amp; J should have talked to each other first. All else has legs. #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeAreThe52 A customs union keeps us tied to the EU. EU trade deals, freedom to travel. It's NOT BREXIT!  #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@politicalite Harrington?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AVMikhailova Don't let the govt run this, they've already proven beyond doubt that they're incapable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillJ3832 Yes, we are. I'm English by birth, Welsh by home, British by nationality, but I like to think of myself as European. #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh right, well, if she says so I guess we should all roll over and take it for the nation.   Not!  #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A bit of a nitwit then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A gentle note, 'caretaker' PM doesn't exist. You're either a PM or not. This is not a role to be played with. #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh ok, I'll share it then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Political navigation without instruments or maps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeAreThe52 You do not understand what you are talking about. #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Peston @Jim_Cornelius @theresa_may Oh god I hope so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrmarksteel Looking good you young available, and bashful thing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuliaHB1 fib<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonlis1 Gotta be in the room! That's the beauty of being a member of a club.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@37paday @DavidHenigUK Yes they could. In fact, I like them! And I don't like Tories, so this is a big thing for me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanDunt Indicative votes good idea, but should have happened weeks/months ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love a good door.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>My heart if full of hope. I am European, I'll stay European. I want my country to be European.   Politically not geographically obvs. We already got one of these, and we can't give it up.  #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very useful table, thank you. #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@malinimehra @GuitarMoog @GregHands @wdr5 @mediawhizz @BritishInEurope Is @GregHands fibbing?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@rowena_kay @LapGongLeong @Metatone2 @Sime0nStylites @blue2win Could you really stand to dance like that, or would that be something you'd control as well?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidallengreen I concur<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidallengreen I disagree. I think it's in the gift of the executive.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do it, just do it!  #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelRosenYes Sixth form college funding not being addressed. It's as if DfE thinks if they don't mention it the whole problem will go away. Just look at the state WQE Leicester has gotten into through the lack of funds. Long story, but worth unpicking!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True  #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidallengreen Done<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why did T May keep telling me what I'm thinking and wanting? If she does know what I want she's missing the target badly! #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Channel4News @cathynewman In your lead in you stated we could crash out next week. We might also rescind A50. Why not mention that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sean_Kemp @davidallengreen From a man who showed such wisdom in the past, FFS JC, sit down and talk! There's no time for theatre. #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One for you @JMBLeicester<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What a mess<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Unwise_Trousers I vote cat<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oooooh, we'll be ok now then.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I am unhappy with this prediction.  #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidLammy @theresa_may I hate this PM so much. This is not leadership!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Once DUP realise (like they don't know already) that parliament can't bind a successor they'll vote against again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>While I agree no parliament can bind a successor, I'm with Peston on the failure of MV3 for the govt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@larrymeath Read, short, elegant and relevant   https://t.co/zuIZB8YrkX<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|> https://t.co/zuIZB8YrkX #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I concur.  #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>MV3 will be followed by MV4, about an hour before the deadline. Why oh why can the Govt have multiple votes but the people can't? #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This makes me so cross<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidallengreen Thank you<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeAreThe52 We voted for Brexit with a "deal" Politicians must vote to remove no-deal March 29: we Expect to noe leave  #Brexit #WeAreThe20Million<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed, funny, truthful and contemporary, excellent TV  #Home @Channel4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not even VW?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeAreThe52 It is crucial that NO MP leaves a WTO Deal on the table - it was not promised in both the Labour and Conservative manifestos,  and 17.4 million never voted for it!   #Brexit #WeAreThe20Million<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I, sir, concur  #BREXIT<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed  #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matteoj17 Who do you think has a cast iron resolve to nationalise the commanding heights of the economy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeAreThe52 A flawed and naive analysis of a big and serious situation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matteoj17 I asked nicely, you come back with insults. When did your heart become so black?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matteoj17 Sorry, I didn't get it. Can you help?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matteoj17 Eh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He was a nitwit at education, he's now a nitwit at health. Yet another fine example of the class of leadership the Tories currently have to offer.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DCBMEP @JamesDangerfi18 @kitmalthouse @SteveBakerHW @Lorand_Bartels Oh please not the GATT Art.24 crap again. It doesn't work the way the #Brexit lovers think it does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeAreThe52 The BIGGEST vote in OUR HISTORY offered a clear message to MPs: we want to crash our car industry on March 29.  #brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeAreThe52 The promise was simple: if we vote to lose control, we LEAVE on March 29. No excuses.  #brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeAreThe52 Hooray!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SteveBarclay More Tory lies and spin<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Totally agree, and what a bike!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@upthepipe I've changed my mind. Not 'going into battle, but 'at the disco'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will Self for PM  #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@upthepipe I know this isn't a #stupidlions I've found, but I've recently found out he's on the Ceredigion county flag. He is a reguardant lion (looking backwards). I like to think he's wondering whether he's left the gas on as he goes into battle.  https://t.co/u0bbZskxh2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bootdisk Nicer than yours<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Raab says woe betide any MPs who don't honour #Brexit vote. I say woe betide any MP who tells us Brexit will be easy/beneficial and then sells us a pup #bbcqt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As ever societies problems caused by Tory austerity. They are economically illiterate #bbcqt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OxfordDiplomat This is a #brexit bonus for them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tickets booked, it's gonna be great!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's always 3 in the afternoon isn't it, come on @liamdutton, let's go for 4 or even 5. Live a little!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fraser_powell @FinancialTimes Indeed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FinancialTimes What the hell is a 'deal dividend'? Signing up to May's car crash of a deal won't suddenly produce income. The markets would SOAR if we said we were going to stay after all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fraser_powell @FinancialTimes The UK economy will need a lot more than the saved £10bn just to stand still. #Brexit , that's any Brexit, will be an economic disaster!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i love @jessphillips, she's great!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Government says the queues will be 'miles long.' Eurostar boss doesn't want to spook customers. 🙄 Government says Eurostar may stop running. Eurostar boss has said timetables are the same, it's just some trains might be cancelled. #Brexit #WeAreThe20million<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sad  #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I, from a rooftop, concur.  #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DrSueOosthuizen @Baxter47Ron Oooh, that looks good. Going on my list I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mike_Fabricant Tit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So true.  #Brexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@James4Labour @upthepipe Silly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our economy needs migrants. No surprise they're now coming from outside the EU. 'Taking back control of our borders' was #Brexit speak for 'shut the door'. I wonder what they think now?  https://t.co/FFa71TCYkA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DawnHFoster A<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I, sir, wholeheartedly concur.  #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is significant and deeply worrying. more than ever parliament must get a grip, because this govt hasn't. #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Will that holiday be in Europe?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Proper cricket. No one looks at the man hit, all eyes on the ball! Excellent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gron_ron they're already using your money to bride us into #Brexit. All this false arrangements being made and paid for to facilitate no deal, when no deal was never going to happen. Waste on a grand scale, for nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeftFootFwd She has not switched, she has resigned the whip. Get it right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrHickmott @JimMFelton Sad<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RidgeOnSunday @faisalislam Barry Gardiner is talking through his hat!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrJohnNicolson @upthepipe If a new party emerges with these polices I will not support it. But while the #IndependentGroup oppose #brexit, they get my support. One battle at a time, and Brexit is simply the most important one right now. @UKLabour is failing to oppose Brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@upthepipe Ruby went along to watch, no report back yet though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Defecting Labour MPs have not said they have 'no problem' with #austerity, they group together with Defecting Tories to stop #Brexit, an issue even bigger than the shitfest that is austerity.  https://t.co/NSe5YYmVJb  via @GoogleNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bring back the master! (JM Keynes)  #austerity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He is not a 'relic'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The broad church of @UKLabour in the New Labour years was home for @jeremycorbyn , why can't JCs party be as broad and be home to @IanAustinMP ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, but only as part of #GE2019, this HoC needs a factory reset.  #Brexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Thank you @BBCkatyaadler for clear analysis. UK Government increasingly looking out of their depth. Sad and worrying. #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed  #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OxfordDiplomat Tomo? I don't like that. But I do like 'overmorrow', the day after tomorrow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The waste of time, effort and money makes me want to weep. The #Tories have become slaves to #Brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@martinpmurray Wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#failinggrayling<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>UK economy already £30bn smaller than predicted due to #Brexit, economics growth down to 1.2%, 1in 4 chance of recession. #Tories, the party of business.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice #Brexit digest of where we are right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't like Tories.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I concur. I didn't, but now, after a cup of tea, re-read the letter, calmed down, I do, indeed, concur.  #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheNWRA @JAMESSI26025411 @jrmaidment @Jacob_Rees_Mogg @BorisJohnson @jeremycorbyn @LiamFox And trade gravity is often overlooked. It is a well documented economics theory. Distance adds cost. You simply cannot replace EU trade with US trade.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheNWRA @JAMESSI26025411 @jrmaidment @Jacob_Rees_Mogg @BorisJohnson @jeremycorbyn @LiamFox We are also highly dependent on integrated manufacturing. Check out the life of an engine in a mini. The crankshaft alone crosses borders 5 times before it's fitted, getting different jobs done in different  countries.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheNWRA @JAMESSI26025411 @jrmaidment @Jacob_Rees_Mogg @BorisJohnson @jeremycorbyn @LiamFox Yes. Any #Brexit will bring a cost. We lose sight of the fact that 80% of our economy is services. That is everything from the London city banks trading all the way to the driver of a lorry crossing the channel. It's all providing a service.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mughes84 @hugorifkind I think an awful lot of them are actually learning American.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SheRa_Marley @GuitarMoog Marcus Fysh is a fool.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoIAmTonyGreen Oh god I hope so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer @Andrew_Adonis Indeed, what we need right now is a strong remain opposition, with a leader ready to promote that to his last breath. Where are you @UKLabour when the call goes up?   #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheNWRA @JAMESSI26025411 @jrmaidment @Jacob_Rees_Mogg @BorisJohnson @jeremycorbyn @LiamFox FTA is only a third of the battle. You need a customs union and a single market to integrate your manufacturing &amp; service sector. You also need to consider trade gravity.  #Brexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Peston I joined because on Corbyn. I left because of Corbyn. When he and the @UKLabour align themselves with opposing #brexit, I will join again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeAreThe52 Hooray!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ok<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>£800k!, I'd dig you a second tunnel for that.  More wasted money on #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There are no deals to be done around the world that will replace what we have with the EU. Not to mention the damage to our friendships and our reputation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is incorrect. Not a good look for an MP to be so ignornant about basic 20th Century history.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this what the current #brexit machinations are about @NeilDotObrien , its what it feels like.  https://t.co/8ftglpbejq<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>False, try not to lie.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WeAreThe52 Your easy, off the cuff statements are playing with people's lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeAreThe52 And if you lower tariffs for the EU, you have to lower it for the US and everyone else. Our industry, and agriculture will be wiped out overnight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WeAreThe52 Hmmm, a no deal #Brexit will create a hard border around Britain and therefore a hard border around NI. We will be a third country, we will pay tariffs, we will have to prove origin of goods etc.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@daveleys4 This is, I believe, a poor reading of where EU has got to. If you look at the concessions Cameron got in 2016, then all is OK. close economics ties stops wars happening.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is the only piece of WW2 imagery I want to see associated with #Brexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NeilDotObrien @SamGyimah @ukonward Sorry, should have read, see the @ukonward report on how to muck about on the fringes of a big problem to make it look like we're trying to do something.  #Tories #austerity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes let's. Thank you @37paday for shining the torch of enlightenment into the dark unicorn stables where we find the #Brexit loving tories still trying to fit a saddle on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True, gotta add in SM. therefore might as well finish the job and stay in.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching BoJo speech at JCB, I see he is still chasing unicorns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don't think John Bercow cares. He'll already he going into all political history books, a much better and longer lasting honour.  https://t.co/V7SOyS0WHb  #Brexit #Speaker<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JadeEONeil @thhamilton @LouiseAnkersLD Hear hear<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please God NO!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lots more new young voters and must let Brits abroad vote this time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Referendum question should be PM's deal or stay.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So, no HoC majority for no deal, the PMs deal or a general election. That leaves #PeoplesVote, Norway+, extend A50 or cancel A50. EU will only extend for #PeoplesVote and I reckon that's where we'll go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidallengreen Indeed<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Best tweet of the day so far, and there's been a few.  #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilDotObrien I, as your constituent, don't want these things. Why are you doing this?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>#Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tatjana7217 I am fascinated by your confidence in the UKs ability to survive outside the EU club.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SJ_Powell @Tommoriarty16 I fail to understand. What would be 'bound'? Any future govt could start the leave process again if they chose to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tatjana7217 If someone bought your car over the phone for £2000, but once he saw it only offered £1000, are you still duty bound to sell it anyway, at the lower price. No, of course not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnRealSmith @paulwaugh @mattwarman He hasn't changed any HoC rules, he has made sure the sovereignty of the Commons is maintained. It's the executive who have attempted to usurp the system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SJ_Powell @Tommoriarty16 Illegal?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevinGreer365 Fascinating that the #tories are rarely if ever challenged that they don't actually represent the majority of opinion in the UK. #Brexit #BrexitChaos<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bet she won't<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oooooo, that's not good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Doing what is right is throwing out this incredible mess of a deal and govt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Mrs May told MPs: "It is time to forget the games and do what is right for our country." How dare she, having screwed about with the nation for two years, now we all have to buckle down and do as we're told! NO and NO!   #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@stevecoleOxford The Brexit referendum question was flawed in its design, it will be flawed next time. We need the politicians to sort this out. But in the absence of a solution it will become the only escape route.  https://t.co/sUghg0rPgF #brexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, Tory to the core, business profits first, workers rights second.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidDuguidMP Do you agree that much of the UKs catch goes to the EU market?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidDuguidMP Indeed, still time to get this right though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We will also be handcuffed by international fisheries policies, something which we have a better control of within the EU.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Specifically access to EU market, which 80% of UK catch goes to, will be lost. A huge blow to the UK fleet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidDuguidMP speaking about fisheries under the PMs deal and getting his facts woefully wrong. What a disappointment that MPs are still so poorly informed at this stage. #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent piece from Winters. I do hope my MP, @NeilDotObrien has read it.  #brexit #WTO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If, as looks likely, the PMs #Brexit deal is voted down, are you @NeilDotObrien happy that the Plan B proposal will only get 90mins of debate? It's a tad short don't you think?  https://t.co/VsQBTzrUiO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you for reminding us of these past outrages which are very important but can get lost in the fog of war.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenSmith_MP I think you get about 7 playing cards and are expected to join in a game or two.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jim_Cornelius @iainmartin1 Have seen a couple of interviews now making reference to Brecow 'breaking parliamentary rules', but nobody being able to point to which rule he's broken. Mainly because he hasn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bercow wouldn't need to make unusual decisions if the PM wasn't playing silly games with parliament and running down the clock. Her actions are undemocratic, not his.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rory Stewart asked by @Channel4News which parliament rules Bercow had broken. Couldn't answer, because he hasn't broken any!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True. Let's not forget, minority govt, advisory referendum, executive red lines. Let parliament sort this out, oh, it is!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How will you vote on amendment 7 of the Finance bill @NeilDotObrien ? Are you happy to see your constituents poorer if we leave the EU with no deal. #brexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not only do some MPs wrongly suggest this, but some should know this so they can simply debunk this lie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watching finance bill debate in HoC. No one trades on WTO only, but that is continually suggested. When will someone educate MPs about this! #brexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is happening?! Why don't the police stop this abuse?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No, you need to deal with low prior attainment. This govt has savaged post 16 education funding to they can maintain their 'ring fenced' education spending mirage. You can't build a first rate education system while cutting spending by over 30%!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>T May is a liar.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed, ONS telling the full story rather than hiding the financial costs as this govt has been doing since increasing student loans to £9k and charging the incredible interest rate of 6%!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>FFS, not one but two MPs embracing economics from 'The Sun'. No wonder this govt is in trouble.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet again, why are you pushing graduates to be an earner for the govt from day 1? We need art, music, philosophy, theology to be complete. Open your eyes to a bigger world, not just the neo-liberal money oriented society Thatcherism created.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DaveOneSixNine @DavidHenigUK Feels risky<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But there will be a hard border.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I may use this to replace 2018's insult of choice, 'airhole'. However, year is young and not sure I want to commit too early.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilDotObrien Is there no such thing as studying for the love of knowledge anymore, or must every course produce a financial return? Will we not allow poets or artists to study at university?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shahbazaka786 @faisalislam I disagree sir. There are 3 options on the table. May deal, no deal and no #Brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilDotObrien @Will_Tanner @guymiscampbell @GillianKeegan Stop taxing knowledge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilDotObrien @Will_Tanner @guymiscampbell @GillianKeegan What is a 'low value course'? Graduates need to work, but we're not all trying to make a fortune. some learn for the sake of knowledge. What makes a course low value is the outrageous fees and the sky high interest applied to them. Remove fees!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HugoLabour @upthepipe @UKLabour Would love to join as soon as the leader follows policy made by conference.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Brilliant!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Clear and concise, now pay attention at the back, it's your future were talking about.  #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is how it's done @BBCNews, now come on, get a grip of facts, it's your job.  #Brexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>So true.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I, sir, concur<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I concur<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like this plan. As it's free, may I take two please? Just in case someone does something silly again.  #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Wrong!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Am I right in saying this @NeilDotObrien ? There is nothing inevitable about no deal. Your party is preparing your constituents to be poorer. has any govt ever done this outside of war time, by choice? #Brexit @HarbMail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never forget, a 'no deal' exit would be this govts choice. They can stop it at any  moment. Anything bad coming from this they choose to inflict on you.   https://t.co/8ShnPqfciN #brexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Rachael_Swindon @upthepipe Right oh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you think a 2.4% GDP target is more or less achievable outside the EU @NeilDotObrien? Please advise. From a worried constituent<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gavinesler @StevePeers This was a big factor in the British army banning cameras in front line trenches. Didn't want the wrong story being recorded, needed the 'fighting spirit' and hatred of the Hun to be kept up at home.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Corbyns social policy stance is to be commended, but he'll have no leeway to make it happen if we're floundering in a Brexit induced recession.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yes indeed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keir_Starmer But, Santa loves sherry!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Do you this is true @NeilDotObrien ? Is yes why? What are the govt hiding?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@David__Osland @upthepipe Although I am a rich man, as I now have a choice denied to others. I'll be voting for a pro-EU party that will get in, Plaid Cymru.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@David__Osland @upthepipe No<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilDotObrien Just to be clear here, this is a classic, 'someone we aspire to be like is almost as shit as us therefore we're off the hook' routine. Good govt strategy @Tories, way to go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@antoniafrances @Jim_Cornelius @labourlewis @UKLabour Only 3 years a member for me but voted @UKLabour always. I too have jacked in my membership and cannot vote labour until common sense breaks out. I urge labour to listen to its membership and to reason.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I concur<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@unionlib @upthepipe FFS what sort of socialism do you think you'll get standing alone in this world. I'm looking forward to an Attlee style govt, led by JC, inside the EU.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@upthepipe @sarahwollaston I think she would vote with the PM right up until TM actually has a tattoo on her forehead saying 'I love no deal'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you concur @NeilDotObrien ? Are you of the opinion that No Deal is OK? Please advise for the benefit of your constituents.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I, sir, concur, wholeheartedly.  #Brexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed indeed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanDunt Why are you watching it? #getoffthesofaanddosomethingbetterinstead<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Nice card, well done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>hair hair!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This will continue until T May concedes her deal is dead. Then we can move to an outcome that might gain a majority in parliament/country. Someone needs to take her on one side and tell her the horse is dead, stop flogging it! #Brexit  #Peoplesvote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FabianZuleeg @GuitarMoog Wrong, its this deal or no #Brexit.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I, sir, concur.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilDotObrien additionally, why are police getting a one year pay 'bonus' rather than a pay rise. What happens in year 2 to their pay?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilDotObrien Is the £13m for additional police services or will it be used to fund their pay rises. If the latter, which I might add they sorely deserve, then how will additional services be funded?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarbMail @NeilDotObrien @NeilDotObrien gets out his trumpet to rally the Tory faithful but can only manage one small toot, and that's a bum note to boot. There is so much this Tory govt has screwed up with #Austerity, a letter to a mate in the govt won't fix it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Sime0nStylites While I agree with this whole thread, I fear that the @UKLabour unicorns are only now having their saddles fitted on the mistaken idea that simply accepting to have a customs union will somehow unlock a whole cornucopia of new offers from the EU.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EggySoldier @NeilDotObrien quite so, I stand corrected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilDotObrien Why wont TM test her deal, which I think we can all agree is 'not perfect' and is not what we were promised? She should put it back to the people to confirm whether it is what the people want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilDotObrien If a second referendum democratically chose remain would you honor that?

<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Those difficult decisions were ideologically driven by Neo-liberalism. Same difficult decisions made in 1945 but in a Keynesian fashion.

<|startoftext|>not the same<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, I'll do that via my MP, @NeilDotObrien , wadda think Neil, proud of the @Conservatives legacy from the last 8 years?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilDotObrien getting ready for a leadership battle?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>have to be found from further cuts.   Tories, working hard to wreck your kids lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>produce a generation ready to work if we cannot fund their education properly? And now the govt, since removing its public pay cap, has said any recommended pay increase for sixth form teacher won't attract any govt funding. It will<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But the horror story in schools is repeated doubly in colleges. Sixth Form teachers haven't had an above inflation pay rise for 8 years! Funding for Sixth Form is down 21% since 2008. How are we suppose to<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nick Gibbs dances around the figures to put a positive spin on #Tory education funding. He insults us all by telling us all is OK when we can see that it isn't, he is, as ever for the Tories, asleep at the wheel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What an insightful perspective on our troubles. How have the #Tories caused so much mess with so little ammunition?   #Brexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please advise @NeilDotObrien , do you think, as my MP, that #Brexit will be good for the UK and will raise living standards for your constituents. Wake up and tell us, we have a right to know! @HarbMail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilDotObrien "Prison works", Michael Howard 1993. Except it doesn't when your #Tory govt cuts funding so much that prison becomes a dystopian catastrophe that doesn't rehabitulate the offender nor 'punish' them. Tory #austerity ain't working.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good   #PeoplesVote #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>not a surprise.  #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet another #Tory who is ignorant of EU rules, however, this time it's the PM!  #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@37paday @matthew_elliott yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not in her interest you mean  https://t.co/6lUo5WuAjI  #Peoplesvote #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>indeed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanDunt Wan't he the bloke from 'The Goodies'?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please don't tell me that the British electorate are wise enough to face a second referendum on the terms of a deal but are also too stupid to be trusted with an option to remain. #brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I, sir, concur<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you @37paday for this concise and in depth dissection of @Keir_Starmer speech. I wholeheartedly agree with your analysis.  #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>OMG, how embarrassing for @Conservatives that their MPs still don't understand how tariffs work after arguing about #Brexit for 2 years. How can we trust people like Daniel to make important decisions in parliament? #Lostinspace @ShropshireStar<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayAEss Ok to shit the bed if your in it with Maggie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do not concur  #brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CCHQPress Meanwhile, everything going swimmingly at Tory HQ.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Still makes me feel queasy every time I agree with Margaret Thatcher #Brexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I concur  #Brexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmm, I think I do. I have time for him and want him to get this right. In a difficult environment he at least is trying to hold the show together until the leadership admit that a #Peoplesvote is inevitable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Shambles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I fear so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I do hope so<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I concur<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A good question,  what of if Fox? Will you,  won't you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's hope their solution is for us to remain<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I, sir, concur  #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theresa_may waits to the eleventh hour to put #Chequers to the EU, knowing full well it didn't have legs, and then chastises the EU for not having an alternative ready, when it's us doing the leaving. Utter shitfest! #Brexit #PeoplesVote INCOMPETENT!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unbelieveable, she has known for weeks that the EU would not accept Chequers in its current form, and then is surprised and hurt to discover what she already knew. #Brexit #Peoplesvote  https://t.co/QM7IO8vfB5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>sad  #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Important thread, get wise about #Brexit, read this. #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm centre-left and anti-Brexit. I need a rallying point within @UKLabour. If it helps, right now I'd be anything you want, so long as it stops #Brexit. #Peoplesvote  https://t.co/icIfEyIo5o<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good news, let's do it #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jk_rowling @Sathnam Nooooooooo. Blancmange is lovely. Chocolate in a rabbit mould. The best! Just like my granny made.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I concur<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Quite right! That's her job.   https://t.co/dibJmpgsev #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>indeed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Historic<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go on take the test.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Watch for fun or with horror, both appropriate #brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ToryDfE @OECD Excellent, now give the teachers a proper pay raise you #austerity #tory nit-wits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@faisalislam Oh boy, here we go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only accepting the CU &amp; SM will keep frictionless trade. That will be the final compromise that T.May accepts to get the deal, once the hard line Brexiteers have withered away. #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Simon Jenkins says Chequers 'keeps frictionless trade', no, it doesn't! #Brexit  https://t.co/3QpBAj9n5g<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glorious revolution 1688<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>35%, don't tell that to #Tory voters!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>off to the kitchen right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and while your on twitter @NeilDotObrien, please do tell, do you think #Brexit will improve your constituents living standards? If not, why are we doing it? @HarbMail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So why do we see another 145k manufacturing jobs in the UK, because #Tory #austerity has driven down wages to the point where we are becoming slightly competitive again. Telling us your policy has made people poor enough to get a job is not something to boast about.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and before you point out that a lot of those years were Blair's years, don't forget that Thatcher said that New Labour was her greatest achievement. The truth is manufacturing chases low wages. #Torybollocks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh for pity's sake @NeilDotObrien, the very article you're posting about shows manufacturing jobs going down from 6.7m in 1978 to 2.6m in 2013, a loss of 4.1m jobs, and you want us to get excited about an additional 145k.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I was going to say 'on the front of a ship'!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Glad to see EU censure of Hungary today. Shame #Tory &amp; UKIP MEPs voted against it. History wont forget that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jason destroys the ERG Irish border plan, what next? #Brexit is a dead duck in a thunder storm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>indeed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilDotObrien totally unacceptable! careful though @neilDotObrien, no one 'broke in'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Were you at the ERG meeting last night @NeilDotObrien? #Brexit @HarbMail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not if you're a sixth form teacher, then you're had another real terms pay cut, for the 9th year running! #Austerity  https://t.co/IdPmLKn8ZF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>indeed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Go on @JeremyVineOn5, make the best show ever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>indeed they should<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I concur, #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>indeed it is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Grand #Tory #Brexit chief onanist shines a light on the Brexit outcome we can expect from the @Conservatives and their band of incompetent nitwits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake. Is this the @UKLabour #Brexit policy right now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HarboroughLP @UKLabour No I didn't, because my position is not in line with party policy. As JC keeps on stating, the people voted, we must leave the EU. he is out of line with the membership.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just so its really clear, I, as a card carrying @UKLabour member of the @HarboroughLP constituency want the Labour party to reverse Brexit so we can stay in the EU. That's right in, like we've got right now. #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>indeed, how is it that the public knew what they were voting for and yet the Brexiteers, yes we're looking at you JRM, Johnson et al, cant tell us what it is. #Brexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surprise! There is no single form of words that makes #Brexit work, we should abandon the whole idea and STAY IN THE EU!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you concur with Dr. Lee @NeilDotObrien? I would be very interested to hear your views, which currently you appear to be keeping to yourself. From a worried constituent. #Brexit @HarbMail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#bbcaq austerity is required but should be done during times of boom, not straight after a crash. Tory incompetence in economics. Should have followed the rules of the master, John Maynard Keynes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let it out mark, let it out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good point well made #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow, if you read one thread today, make it this one. We are so lucky to have wonderful people in this world who work hard for others. #austerity doesn't work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Poor lion &amp; poor you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Happy now @Conservatives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on @HarbMail, the biggest political event since the Suez crisis is happening in real time in front of your eyes. Why aren't you holding @NeilDotObrien s feet to the fire?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you think the #Chequers plan still has legs @NeilDotObrien? Please do advise your anxious constituents #Brexit @HarbMail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which side of history will you be on @NeilDotObrien? #Brexit @HarbMail<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now then @CPhilpOfficial, about what you were tweeting about the other day. Its not really all that accurate is it? And @NeilDotObrien, best see what @FactCheck has to say before retweeting poor stats #austerity @HarbMail @Conservatives Poor show!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>highly detailed analysis that demos clearly this argument.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UKLabour Hardie, Bevan, Attlee, Wilson, Benn are all looking down at you now, don't let them down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It offers the British people less control and less sovereignty than they had before. That wasn't on the side of the bus! #Brexit  https://t.co/gfgwILloQ5 via @prospect_uk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please advise your constituents @NeilDotObrien, are you a member of or do you support the ERG group in parliament? @HarbMail @Conservatives #Brexit from a worried constituent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you approve of this @NeilDotObrien, a move by a fellow Leicestershire #Tory MP?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ooooerrr, Cornwall again I think.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can you answer this please @NeilDotObrien, do you think your constituents lives and livelihoods will improve outside the EU? From a worried constituent @HarbMail @Conservatives #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fun with #Brexit , who'd have thought.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>by the way @CPhilpOfficial, do you think Britain will be better off if we leave the EU with no deal? Please answer, because @NeilDotObrien wont/cant.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and the saddest thing about all of this, the fact that these #Tories actually believe they're doing a good job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh please get a grip. #Austerity has ruined 1000's of lives, people struggle by on poor quality, low pay jobs and the minimum wages is £7.83. Could you live on £7.83ph, and don't say you could, because you couldn't, no-one can! #Tories the caring face of Neo-lib capitalism!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this the real face of #Tory #Austerity? For me, yes!  https://t.co/C7yv9WJWao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not quite<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Excellent piece.  Fills me with dread. My prediction.... #tory party implodes,  #GE2019 happens but without JC as leader as he supports #Brexit. Kier Starmer takes over and leads UK to bright new social democratic future inside EU. Hooray!  https://t.co/dgAiMd2Ni4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please read one and all.  Excellent analysis and summary #brexit  https://t.co/dgAiMd2Ni4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you think a #PeoplesVote on the final #brexit deal would be a betrayal of democracy @NeilDotObrien ? Please advise, from a worried constituent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does Liam Fox have your full confidence @NeilDotObrien ? Do you believe he's doing a good job.  As a constituent I just want to know where you stand.  #brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can hardly wait<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I concur<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well put, all so unhappily true. #PeoplesVote #brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I concur<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If our govt should protect, defend and improve the lives and livelihoods of the British people, do you think leaving the EU will do that? Your opinion please @NeilDotObrien. from a worried constituent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>another important thread that clearly demonstrates why we need full CU &amp; SM access. It's not all about goods, in fact, it's hardly about goods at all! #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesMelville I'll take it all except the Euro thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Let's hope so. Would then become available for next series of Strictly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I support your position.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Chequers will split the #Tories and crash this govt, a FTA with NI border back stop will split DUP from its £1bn coalition agreement and crash this govt. Two routes to the same destination? Do you concur @GuitarMoog @jonlis1 @JasonJHunter #Brexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>indeed they do not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Come on BBC, get with the program<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow, 10 years, and we're still paying for it big time with the #tories bizarrely timed austerity!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes, keep asking!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One second!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I have signed this initiative  https://t.co/F23JLeDvAp. Sign it and share it! its to fight for EU citizenship for Brits after Brexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NeilDotObrien @CllrPhilKing powerful stuff, that'll make 'em sit up and listen!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lawyers4britain We cannot replicate our EU schedules if any other WTO members complain. Oh, I see USA &amp; NZ already have.

<|startoftext|>@Andrew_Adonis 2010 Libs went with Tories because Clegg was an orange book man and wanted economic liberalism and austerity Friedman style.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danielmgmoylan Worth reminding people that the £39bn we will pay the EU isn't a entry fee to trade talks but money we owe them for previous work and our future commitments.  We could of course not pay any of it by simply remaining in the EU #Brexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We follow in the steps of Owen and 888.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you agree with JRM @NeilDotObrien ? from a worried constituent. #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilDotObrien do you think the UK will be better off by leaving the EU? #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilDotObrien Have you looked at Boris Johnson's Facebook page recently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I concur. #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@formerleftie @NeilDotObrien #tories push societies problems onto charities to remove them from govt financial responsibility e.g. Help for Hero's. How dare a govt ask soldiers to risk life and limb and then not fully pay for the best care possible on their turn. Instead it's pushed onto public giving.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@formerleftie @NeilDotObrien Austerity is in fact not the problem, it is the timing of its application. An economy should pay down it's debt when booming, #tories did it from 2010 when economy on its knees. This was economical incompetence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@formerleftie @NeilDotObrien ? Thank you for responding. I don't understand what you say. I would gladly pay more tax/work to improve the society I live in. Tories via austerity are killing society.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So say I.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>it breaks your heart<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Not a good move for the #Tory party, who do you side with @NeilDotObrien ? JRM or the PM. Please advise, you should let your constituents know. #Brexit @Conservatives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrmblue @MooseAllain I always say 'doors to automatic', although I have no idea what it means.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>yet another reason why No Deal for #Brexit can't work, we have no WTO schedule of concessions!  https://t.co/FVmTZFzoYL via @YouTube<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is UK economic growth higher than in Europe? Spoiler alert, NO  https://t.co/9XIqSzMIsE via @FullFact<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilDotObrien while I do not understand nor condone asking the BBC to publish such data, please don't attack the person for the action of their parents. No child chooses the school they attend, their parents do, and therefore shouldn't be held accountable for it. Poor show!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@formerleftie @NeilDotObrien are you sure you're not confusing social democracy with democratic socialism? but please don't, as a conservative, talk about other people using their money kindly, the irony makes others sick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I concur. #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A no-deal #Brexit will not happen. Here’s why  https://t.co/FEAqsMFpAM via @IrishTimesOpEd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Did he pass it to the left?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting article that helps show that the whole #Brexit problem is huge, and will not be settled easily or without pain.  https://t.co/D453uLUSDz<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>wrong  https://t.co/BHX8kzSa66 via @GoogleNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surprise.......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>this 'easiest deal ever', better than it was before crap #Brexit deal is, well, crap. This is all sounding like getting ready for war, not brave new golden times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll try.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this one of the #Brexit benefits the Leavers promised?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>why?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm beginning to think that maybe #Brexit isn't worth it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>indeed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>good<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed, and @UKLabour would.....?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Silly indeed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like @UKLabour but I can't like their #Brexit strategy until they decide whether Starmer/Gardiner/Corbyn is in charge of it. I get mixed messages, I like the Starmer version, please can we have a single unified approach please.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True, clear analysis. Avoid the #Tory misdirection by having @jonlis1 as your pathfinder on this miserable #Brexit road.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you @DavidHenigUK for a #Brexit thread based on fact, please read, digest and repeat. It is a shame that too many #Brexit supporters appear to be so happy to close their ears and eyes to the reality of a Brexit future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Do you honestly believe that Britain is better off outside of the EU?" JC couldn't answer this easy question, can you @NeilDotObrien ? #Brexit @Conservatives<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hate you @muira98 because you speak the truth I don't want to hear. #Brexit #PeoplesVote I fear I may be in the same camp as you, and that makes me feel so sad. @UKLabour<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As if more fuel for the #Brexit bonfire were needed, here it is, in its cold, depressing reality. As clearly stated, Brexit is harming the UK, and we haven't left yet. This will be a total wrecking of the UK economy, and what makes it the worst, it's self inflicted. #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A little harsh maybe,  but by God aren't we ready for @UKLabour to be the antidote to the crap that is #Tories #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fair comment,  would you care to explain what @UKLabour would do different,  and it's probably about time that we get a bit of detail please #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time grows short @NeilDotObrien , the #Brexit reckoning is almost upon us. When the time comes, will you support a No-Deal exit from the EU? I think your constituents should know, don't you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ladies and Gentlemen, form a queue please to read a most important thread that, alone, demonstrates why we should stay FULL members of the EU. I'm in, how about you? #Brexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>what is it that can't be achieved while staying part of the EU? Too many Leavers are too close to the problem to see the light #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>In the mean time #Tory #Austerity as shifted debt with reports of £19bn now being owed by ordinary households. This is not a success story.   https://t.co/SDvQST808i<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I thought the whole point of all this pain was because so 52% of people wanted less migration?! #Brexit  https://t.co/Dbd1VZEJIV via @GoogleNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How bad does it have to get?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thats #austerity for you. Economic dyscalculia from the #Tories. Should have asked JMK for help!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hhesterm @BBCr4today you did give Trade Minister Rona Fairhead an easy ride this morning. Why are difficult questions like those in this thread not being put? #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>another important thread to show how the #Tories are still in denial / lying about #Brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Great thread, shows exactly why we should have #PeoplesVote #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A simple reminder of another huge benefit we will lose should we leave the EU #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Longish but important thread on why no deal #Brexit is a non starter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>How many times hasn't he won a seat in parliament?   https://t.co/ZAZTThXP8U via @GoogleNews #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilDotObrien Where is it, what did they say, and why ain't it there now?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Which one indeed?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're with you Simta<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is my understanding of this correct @GuitarMoog @jonlis1 @IanDunt please advise.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No Deal means WTO rules exit. That means a hard border in NI. that breaks section 10 of the EU (Withdrawal) Act 2018. Therefore can't happen. Next! #Brexit #peoplesvote  https://t.co/0xzVBBEAfl via @GoogleNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is a govt dept using tax payers money to promote a political parties position on #Brexit? That's not right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Such incoherent ramblings, no wonder #Brexit is in such a mess, let's not bother.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JasonJHunter is a clever chap. Watch this video, follow him, get wise about #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrew_jarv thanks for following, great tweet and you're a LCFC fan, such good taste! Hope we do a number on wolves this weekend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Insightful, informative and relevant #Brexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well put<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Andrew_Adonis You can't beat a real good soft brie<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#lies #brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I couldn't agree more, this is normal #tory policy spin, not a good look @NeilDotObrien<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Liberal elite = ERG et al. And yes, they can't understand why so many people voted leave, still don't know what to do with it, now terrified they wont deliver, and they can't. #Brexit #PeoplesVote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>so when anyone tell you we can 'grow our way out of food shortages', they are either delusional, or are liars. #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And even if we do grow more, UK agribusiness is almost entirely dependent on imports of farm machinery, we simply don't produce that here any more, 3/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1976 saw that descend to 1:1, and now we need about 3 calories of petrochemical energy to produce 1 calorie of food energy. If the £ crashes on the back of a 'No Deal' #Brexit we are the losers, as oil is priced in US dollars 2/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1976 was an important year for agriculture and #Brexit. During WWII UK farming produced about 2.5 calories of food energy for every 1 calorie of petrochemical input. 1/<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As do I,  It's so awkward.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet another low for #tory #austerity, trying to balance the books at entirely the wrong time.  Need to dig up J M Keynes, time for a return of the master   https://t.co/1X0BfpYVkq  via @GoogleNews<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you for bringing clarity to this argument #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I concur<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sarah is right<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vote Leave cheated! The referendum result is built on sand. The people deserve a second vote, on the actual deal, not just vague promises or damn right lies! #PeoplesVote #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonlis1 help me though @jonlis1 , with Chequers dead doesn't the Blind Deal become more likely? In fact, is there a Blind deal? or is it just a figment of the Express?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ooooh, naughty Leavers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you Jim, carefully done actually, but still the bright light on reality we all need.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Have you ever seen a govt so incompetent? And let's face it, there's been some howlers over the decades, but this bunch are truly shite, I mean really bad.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Push the whole story too far and find, suddenly, it is the only deal left on the table.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This govt treads a fine line. Make No Deal sound bad so any deal they can cobble together looks OK or....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And let's be clear, there is no Economic Powerhouse to be had (don't you think others would be doing it?), it's pure unicorn fantasy to cover the embarrassment of a govt asleep at the wheel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Love the term 'World Trade Deal' being used instead of its correct name which is 'we've fucked up and are crashing out with no deal'. #Brexit  https://t.co/DE4LsKeAW8<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Interesting<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LidlUK @BootstrapCook Well done<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'm sorry to say I am one of those casualties, can't stand @BBCr4today while they continue to be toothless when dealing with #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We have to lower traiffs to make our goods more attractive, that means have a tariff lower than the EU. what is the EU tariff for agri-tech? I bet it ain't high.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or will she and her dinghy on a trailer be stuck on the M20?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If, under a shitty no deal outcome, the aeroplanes are grounded, will we see the PM having to row across the channel (Dunkirk style), to ask to be allowed back into the club, as it's worse than she thought? #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He has no idea about reality.  Anyway,  #Brexit was suppose to be brilliant,  not take us back to war time conditions.  And please don't say we we're never happier than during the war!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed,  go get him @krishgm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So true<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is gloomy, I wonder how prepared Harborough council is? What do you think @NeilDotObrien , should we worry? When will your party tell us the impact, it appears the EU has told it's people. #brexit  https://t.co/TBD7MBgLI6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I concur<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ta, love a bit of maths and stats.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh, thank you @TheScepticIsle , that kinda puts that one to bed then. #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think I agree with @Aidan_Regan #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hay, who knows, I bet this is a good read, but we'll never know while it's stuck behind a pay wall! I wonder if @dsmitheconomics is interesting? If you tweet it, make it available!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We wouldn't be fucking about wasting our time with #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ha<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I concur<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well said @sturdyAlex<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oooops<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well said sir<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I concur<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And more importantly, Tony Benn.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just what John Maynard Keynes used to say.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think the misunderstanding is by Hunt #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This demonstrates such economic incompetence that it's shameful that you're an MP #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Jeremy Hunt warns EU Britain will not 'blink', it's still a playground game to the tories #brexit @telegraph  https://t.co/rLag3ADhMc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Too true<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It also has one of my most favourite lines, simple but lovely  https://t.co/31U2fkEUES<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>One of my favourite opening to a book that I am ashamed to say I've never managed to complete. It's from At Swim-Two-Birds by that master of writing Flann O'Brien @Unwise_Trousers  https://t.co/AMkyjqvvrM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please God no! Is this true @NeilDotObrien ? If so, what's your party doing about it? #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this true @NeilDotObrien ? If so, what's your party doing about it? I think your constituents should know #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Was that on the side of the bus?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With #Brexit as their main, but not only weapon, the @Conservatives have shown complete incompetence and made this country an international laughing stock. I'm not happy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Add that to your year plan @JMBLeicester<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brilliant!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I'll buy that, but as ever it requires a lot of planets all to align at the right moment. Politics isn't that neat I fear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>As usual Digby a country mile off reality. Does he check anything?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True, listened to Womad on BBC6Music, loads of complaints from bands about how much trouble they had getting visas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very useful summary of how much shit is in flight towards the fan and how far it will be spread depending on its trajectory. Thank you #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Informative<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>WAKE UP!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get real @NeilDotObrien , tall to us, tell us what's happening, what are you doing about it, how are you planning to vote?......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>And you want me to catch up on the local parish news?.....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We're all looking to our elected leaders for help and comfort in these disturbing times.....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I mean, honestly, your party is on government....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Thank you. Fancy tweeting to your constituents what the hell your party is doing in regard to #brexit ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Indeed. A committed Europhile as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yes! What did you mean,  answer the question please.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Sixth form teacher or college lecturer? Rise likely to be even less.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Welcome news if it comes off, but we mustn't forget that for some public sector workers, like sixth form teachers, the pay cap started in 2010, not 2013. They deserve the highest rises  https://t.co/WMO6x5ilYE<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>be under no illusion @Jeremy_Hunt, if we fail to get a deal with the EU it will be this #Tory govt that will get the blame. For having no plan, for fighting with itself, for not building a consensus, for not listening to the 48%. #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If, @JackofKent , I would want to stop #brexit completely, wouldn't a no deal outcome be preferable in order for the commons to be appalled enough to finally kill the whole project? @davidallengreen  https://t.co/FUJiO4DIWO<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yes, who indeed<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ok, I'm ready. What's the plan? #brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here is the consequences of #tory #austerity at the wrong time,  cuts since 2008, failing services now need fixing, economy failing due to cuts, no money. Now we all pay. Where's Keynes when you need him?  https://t.co/P3DLUmdufz<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@andrealeadsom Economic illiteracy, living within your means is good, but only when the economy is growing, not during a period of #tory #austerity. Please ask a grown up for help here, but not @NeilDotObrien , as he obviously agrees with you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andrealeadsom Massive labour debt? What exactly would the Tories have done different in 2008? How would they have saved the economy and produced no debt?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Andrew_Adonis Attlee, much derided as opposition leader, carried the @UKLabour party into it's first golden period. The improvements in society and the economy would last from 1945 to 1972, when Barber screwed it all up with his 'dash for growth' budget. A new Labour golden period is upon us!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I, sir, concur. There is nothing that we want to do in order to improve the lot of the working man that can't be achieved both within the EU and facilitated by the EU.     #Brexit  https://t.co/p2zsXsvUiv<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>kicking the can down the road, cause they know, but wont admit it, that #Brexit is wrong, a real kick in the teeth for the UK, but can't be seen to lose face................. #Brexit #brexitshambles  https://t.co/GlNU4pHjAA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>that's nice  https://t.co/BbQLuEyJgP<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Yeah, come on @UKLabour , make my world a better place, or if you can't manage the world, just my Europe. #Brexit  https://t.co/urOBGWphUZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Funny and educational  https://t.co/LhwQHAYfbg<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this true @NeilDotObrien? I cannot believe the govt would push through amendments like this! Disgraceful!  https://t.co/G0LItYRC59<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I, sir, concur  https://t.co/EnijQNgHEi<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilDotObrien @OpenEurope an interesting report, however, how does UK maintain its economic position without passporting for financial services?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please, will any pro-brexit person, anyone, just tell me one reason, that isn't a vacuous sound-bite, why #Brexit will be good for the UK?   https://t.co/yR5p4pWLDt via @BIUK_Politics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MimiRossiJ I fear we're getting nowhere with Tom, but I do worry that some Brexiteers fail to see the writing on the wall.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomLaughalot @MimiRossiJ @Petercookwahook @IanTurgenev @Keir_Starmer Ok, I won't, but it is<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TomLaughalot @Petercookwahook @MimiRossiJ @IanTurgenev @Keir_Starmer Remain said UK would be economical hit by #brexit, it already has been (you're £900 worse off (BoE)), it will be on the day we leave, and it will continue to be for years/decades to come. Your and your kids lives will be poorer for #BREXIT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hfmnews What do you think about new rules regarding on pavement parking? For some there is no option, but it really is very inconsiderate at times, can't get buggy through let alone wheel chair!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilDotObrien Glad to hear no fees, what about on pavement parking? Do you have a view?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or at least one max fac camera watching (it's becoming the VARs system for #Brexit )<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh right! So it's the #brexit off side rule, parcels can be passed through so long as there is at least one customs officer between the sender and the goal.  https://t.co/2LMdQSAMvo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Petercookwahook @MimiRossiJ @IanTurgenev @Keir_Starmer We were lied to, given false promises. Now we start to see a clear picture of what #brexit is, and it doesn't look good, we should now be allowed to make an informed decision. Would you like to make a decision based on facts?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilDotObrien A sad state of affairs. However, be careful @NeilDotObrien, eye witness said members 'muttered' during the minute, not heckled.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>C'mon, lets do it!  https://t.co/0ESVwENlVA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DamianHinds How about investing in teachers, who haven't had a pay rise for 8 years, unlike MPs. #austerity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilDotObrien this was actually initiated by Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, who said poor schools where unfairly stigmatised. The real questions  is, of course, why do we have poor school? #Tories #Austerity. Anything to add @NeilDotObrien?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrexshitTrade He's a real Neo-Lib laissez faire kinda guy, the sort this govt loves. and now we've had a peek behind the curtain, and it don't look good does it #Brexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EmporersNewC so sad that many high tech companies in UK will have to shut up shop or move into EU in order to carry on. I cannot believe we are shootijng ourselves in the foot with #Brexit. It is so silly. so so silly. it makes me want to weep!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Which bits of our #tory #austerity savaged economic output is suddenly going to look more attractive to potential trading partners after #Brexit than it does while in the EU? and why? 1/3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I concur  https://t.co/QDD9BIkNEZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Because of #brexit the UK is a wounded animal, with a self inflicted wound, soon to be alone in the jungle of international economics. We will be the toy of China and US. God help us, unless we help ourselves, let's abort #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>She keeps on saying we should, 'just get on with it', what does that mean?

<|startoftext|>indeed  https://t.co/61yYE1W7DY<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I concur, this is largely due to a falling birth rate. What we need is people to come to this country and set up home, have a family, pay taxes, help look after us in our old age.

<|startoftext|>I find it so disingenuous to the voting public that #tories say the referendum vote must be honored however they choose to interpret it, #Brexit is being decided by a split cabinet, not the whole nation like it should be. Find consensus! Unite the country!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrexitStewart the advisory #Brexit referendum did not state anything about GFA, CU or SM on the question. Therefore should be quite open to interpretation of outcome. Do you not agree @brexitStewart?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NeilDotObrien @HelenGoodmanMP Protection of FSM only during UC transition, by 2022 (so long before many school starters have left school), this govt will have stripped a hot meal from many children, or am I wrong @NeilDotObrien ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So my reading of this is that a NI border solution needs to be agreed, in full detail, by about October 2018, Hmmmm, that's a tough nut #Brexit  https://t.co/VOY8DRkLfh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>but ultimately, this is to get all kids with parents on UC and earning £7400pa off FSM by 2022, that is, taking a hot meal away from a school child. #Tories #Austerity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>but if you're in an area yet to move onto UC, you'll be affected immediately when the area does go to UC and your kids won't get FSM if you're over £7400pa........<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and to finish the story, this is for people going onto UC, so if already on UC your kids will get FSM until end of current school......<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Parents with kids in yr3 onward on UC earning £7400+ lose the free school meal, #Tories removing right to free school meals, and NI get an opt-out, nothing to do with DUP supporting this failing govt.
