<|startoftext|>Now, do you think the DOJ will be interested in Jared‚Äôs business or just Hunter Biden‚Äôs taxes. How about trump‚Äôs taxes? Still waiting!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Vote for Democrats in Georgia Senate Race. Demote McConnell. True<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We need a majority of the Republicans in the House and Senate to finally face the playground bully and let him know they won‚Äôt be intimidated.Congratulate Joe and help with transition. Enough is enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Strandjunker I agree. There does not seem to be Republicans that you could work with in  the House or Senate. After trump losing 51 lawsuits they won‚Äôt step up and congratulate the President Elect. This is not conducive to bi partisanship. I hope President Biden uses acting positions.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>$1200 for nine months doesn‚Äôt go very far. Other countries are giving their people monthly stimulus that would add up to what they were earning allowing them to lockdown. If we are the richest country why do we only provide for the rich?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JamieKasara Will do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SweetFnLucifer He should have fired Rudy too. They were both wacko in court. The judge must have been disgusted at the frivolous.ridiculous clown show.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CJ_isnowblue That‚Äôs funny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It did sound like a threat of violence. She really is inRudy‚Äôs alternative world. What are they talking about?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We should check on Mitch for sure.His approval rating was hanging around 12%. How could he possibly win? Kentucky, 4th from the bottom in economy,education,healthcare. Why would you vote for the same and expect different results??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I‚Äôm sure the extension will be denied and these two grifters should be arrested for conspiracy and receiving bribes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seattle_morning @ReesusP Thanks for the reassurance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReesusP Michigan must say no. Governor please step in. This is a trump conspiracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can‚Äôt the Michigan Governor step in and stop this nonsense. Monday is the day to certify the election. Get it done Michigan. We can‚Äôt let him get away with this. Stop it Nancy. These legislators are conspiring with trump. Retweet<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SueMassa256 Isn‚Äôt it time for Congress to subpoena those Michigan legislators and if they don‚Äôt comply while being questioned under oath arrest them. Let them ruin their lives for trump. Not us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>They should be charged for conspiracy.This is not working for the people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CJ_isnowblue It‚Äôs against the law for government workers to accept gifts above $50. They should be drinking beer not champagne.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That‚Äôs exactly what they‚Äôve done and the intimidation and threats are terrifying to election officials and their families. President Biden must not pardon any crimes,to do so would invite more of the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don‚Äôt they know that accepting gifts(bribes) over $50 is against the law when you work for the people. Bottles of Champagne, expensive hotel rooms? Lock em up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamParkhomenko @AKMooserider That certainly sounds full of bull.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I don‚Äôt get it. Surely there are laws in place for emoluments,the hatch act,non payment of rally costs to states,obstruction and treason. The Rule of Law is the mechanism. Right??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sckarr1 @NBCNews This is dangerous. He should not be walking around amongst people. What will stop him from killing again?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is just flaunting the law. He killed two and injured a third. His mother drove him from Illinois to Wisconsin where he obtained an assault weapon and then did what he came to do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReesusP @realDonaldTrump Is he really sick or just doing a N.Korea thing? Isn‚Äôt that where trump got the Covid idea?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sandi_childs I thought Rudy‚Äôs son was the sports director or was that gym Jordan??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@4a_of I keep asking the same question. No warrants, no subpoenas, no arrests. Why? It is not a law that a sitting president cannot be arrested and indicted.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BettyBowers I personally think we should rename the toilet ‚Äúthe trump‚Äù He was very into flushing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@washingtonpost The expression is ‚Äúshit for brains‚Äù. Maybe it‚Äôs not just an expression.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nancy, why are you still waiting? Ask Letitia James to step in and do the job of removing trump now. This is not a law. You can have him removed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Disgusting.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Does Ben Carson have dementia?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this for real. I hope these people are under arrest for domestic terrorism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>trump‚Äôs followers have sunk so low that SOS and poll workers and election officials all need secret service protection. This is truly not the America that other countries want to emulate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Rudy you are a bad joke. There were plenty of poll watchers Republican and Democrat. It‚Äôs hard to believe you were once a lawyer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marleneiloveny @joncoopertweets I‚Äôm sure with a little of trumps venomous evil he can be unappointed by executive order.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joncoopertweets There is no end to this White House trying to dismantle our democracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeTakei You‚Äôre funny George.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReallyAmerican1 @MyraDSirois1 I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs on his list of things to do like his fabulous new healthcare plan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@usa_in_beijing That should qualify. Not too much. Just right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thomaskaine5 That would be appropriate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickamin20 My dream is seeing Letitia James marching in with an arrest warrant and a pair of pink fuzzy handcuffs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KathleenKatfox Add Kentucky to that list.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MickMulvaney Do the math. We needed better schools when you were attending.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Americans want transparency.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@igorbobic Lindsey your nose is going to grow so long you‚Äôll be tripping.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gscucci Anytime is time for carrot cake. Happy Birthday.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Wake up Ditz. Biden won Georgia for a second time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pol1tically And Mitch McConnells.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Eight years out of law school and she is still clerking. This is not qualified. Why her? America needs answers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AIWashburn Thanks for the info.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi Nancy, the American people need a means of support on a monthly basis. Other countries are doing this. People could stay home and not spread Covid if they had a way to pay expenses. Our govt has given trillions to big corporations, why not some millions for the out of resources?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArizonaStation How can he pardon himself if he hasn‚Äôt been arrested yet. Won‚Äôt it be better to arrest him after he is out of the White House and there will be no pardon forthcoming?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dyllyp @RexChapman I‚Äôm impressed. Good job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very good video. Retweet!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree. The transition should also be done in a much shorter time frame to limit the damage of someone like trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OMGno2trump John, if he is not accused of a crime until Joe Biden is in the White House will that stop trump from being able to pardon him?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilLowenthal1 She probably swore off swearing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickamin20 Or a  Bill Cosby.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandyRainbow A tribute to the last four years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QuakerNana Loving kindness is the best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It‚Äôs time Congress. Lindsey should not get away with pressuring states to throw away legal votes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepSwalwell @WonderWoman934 Wisconsin please insist in payment in full upfront. There are states and bus companies waiting for unpaid bills since 2016.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CaslerNoel @WonderWoman934 @realDonaldTrump The military will be obligated to remove him as he will be committing out right treason.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LisaHagan7 NO,NO,NO!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@akkitwts That is heart tugging. Love it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSNBC @NBCNewsTHINK No way. To pardon major crimes is to invite facism into our homes.  Biden will unify the nation by dealing with the pandemic, the children reuniting with their parents, rejoining world organizations, stimulus to sustain until pandemic is over, restoring our relations with allies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DemocracyInn @WonderWoman934 Speaker Pelosi do something to stop insanity. I‚Äôm sure you know he is probably trying to buy,steal, or intimidate electors. A sitting president can be indicted and removed. Talk to Letitia James she could do this. You won‚Äôt need Senate approval or Barrs. They are all corrupt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@akkitwts This child is adorable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nobody is above the law should be true, even for a trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B52Malmet @UhligCathy To allow all the criminal acts of this administration to go unpunished is to invite more of the same.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AudreyStJames1 It‚Äôs too late for help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I love the plot. I‚Äôm laughing already.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listen Murphy, you know you will be looking for a job so why not do what‚Äôs right. Sign the transition papers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Only a trump supporter would be in a crowded bar. No surprise here.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pat Robertson should climb back into his coffin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree. Bunch of bull.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DBalistrer I don‚Äôt either. If he was sick enough to be given remdisiver he wouldn‚Äôt have been driving around to amuse his cult. No doctor at Walter Reed would have allowed that. Right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lindsey retire.lying and being obnoxious is one thing, when you start to do blatantly illegal stuff it‚Äôs time to go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why doesn‚Äôt he just resign then he can keep his secrets to himself and stop kowtowing to trump?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don‚Äôt use words if you don‚Äôt know what they mean McNinny. You don‚Äôt live in the real world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is a sucker born every minute and trump counts on them to keep his pockets full.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kayleighmcenany @PoutchouL @seanhannity Get up to date you ditz.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like that. Why not?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now he is going to try to compromise the electors starting with the military. This is obscene.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The opposing lawyer said that he had never heard such a discombobulated statement and that Rudy couldn‚Äôt stay on topic.He should go back to the Four Seasons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I can‚Äôt believe that even the Republican Party would want this racist in their party. They go from bad to worse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This intimidation gets worse and worse.Surely theFBI can find out who would send threatening letters and texts.ThT is domestic terrorism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope Biden gets over the idea that he can work with these  trump Republicans. He will have to find a way to work around them.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is his plan . To cause disruption in all parts of the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fakedansavage @LouisRBridgema3 This could be better than ‚ÄúScandal‚Äù<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You did it again. More lies Lindsey.Give it a rest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jrpull1 I‚Äôm a full on 10. We need a special commission so thatPresident Biden can concentrate on running the country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You‚Äôre lying Lindsey.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waltshaub Why discuss not counting legal votes. You committed a crime Lindsey. Legal votes must be counted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So what do you do about Lindsey?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SurfnFitnes You are not alone.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Subpoena today. Why is Congress waiting?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AmziQureshi That would be so amazing for today‚Äôs college students. It‚Äôs so much easier to study without the pressing debt always on your mind.Thank you Senator Warren<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If this is true he better not be@left alone for a minute.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@11tulips @kurtfollower It won‚Äôt be distracting at all if we have a special commission. To let this abuse of our country go unpunished is to invite more of the same. We want to discourage facism and dictatorship. Ignoring every rule of law, suppressing our voting,intimidation and corruption. Enough!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now he is going to remove troops from Afghanistan and Iraq when Esper said they were not ready. Esper was fired.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vertical_Titan @jajudd @richones1 Unfortunately our Congress has not enforced one subpoena. Why,why,why?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@FPWellman Congratulations. Enjoy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AudreyStJames1 That‚Äôs appropriate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepDonBeyer It‚Äôs more than a scandal. It is blatantly illegal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I agree. To let criminal acts go unpunished is to invite a repeat of the same. Never again should be our motto.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@marcorubio Stuff it Rubio.  Don‚Äôt preach what you don‚Äôt practice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very peculiar.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MysterySolvent The definition of disease.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>He likes taking a vacation on tax payer money. Why else?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You‚Äôre soooo stupid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>According to Ivanka this is a great economy!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn‚Äôt it the new Republican way to ignore the House and Senate and President Biden could appoint Stace Abrams as a temporary cabinet member? It‚Äôs a new President precedent.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MysterySolvent The Shriek<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump Ivanka, did you not see the hundreds of cars,probably thousands of cars in the food lines in Texas? This is happening all over the country. Would you call that a strong economy? Food lines,unemployment not being paid,no stimulus,evictions, this is not a strong economy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonathanPKatz @allison_ramone An amazing woman. Talented, beautiful and kind and generous.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ericsslater @LindseyGrahamSC Oh what a great idea.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is someone other than Barr going to investigate Lindsey Graham?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Does anybody follow the money?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why? Since when? What govt. agency is that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If he wants a recount make sure he pays in advance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would imagine that Joe  could attain some information from the Democratic Senators or the House. I‚Äôm sure they would cooperate with the new President.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Don‚Äôt you think it‚Äôs time somebody stopped Lindsey Graham from intimidating people and telling them to throw out legal ballots. What is wrong with that guy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Typical trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Another snail crawls back in his shell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do you think it was someone from the immediate family?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump Ivanka, your father knows nothing about science. In January he was still calling the coronavirus a hoax perpetrated against him. If the vaccine works it would be wonderful for the World.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Johanvanderslam @BillOReilly How about giving O‚ÄôReilly the old one two.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Bill, I have a question for you. Considering his background of sexual abuse and business fraud and adultery how did he ever land on a ballot? Who was charged with his vetting?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dave_wildmanaz So sorry, our thoughts are with you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Church and State should be separate. Churches who‚Äôs main objective is making money,buying yachts and mansions should be taxed.Religion was supposed to be non profit. Wasn‚Äôt it Ron L. Hubbard who said that‚Äôs where the money is?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The children at the border should be a priority.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chipfranklin @JoeBiden Throw out all the trash. Miller,Barr,MnNuchin,DeVos,Carson,Paula White, all the trump tots, Rudy,Pompeo,Barr‚Äôs relatives, Rudy‚Äôs son,McNinny,DeJoy,Emily Murphy etc.etc.All the cowardly Republicans with any cabinet positions. Immediately work on pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABC @CATHERINENEVER2 Hasn‚Äôt she been removed yet? What she is doing is against the law. Is it true that she was bribed and is now being blackmailed for the accepting the bribe? Curious minds want to know why she is not doing her job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@historyjudges Wishing you well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CosmicActorVist @ArizonaStation DeJoy needs to be charged with Federal Offenses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If they would all get together and speak up with one voice they might not be intimidated. Safety in numbers repub senators,governors and members of Congress. Go for it!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I‚Äôd like to hear some of the reasons why. Wouldn‚Äôt you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@moonbreeze2 @PalmerReport Is this going to cost the American tax payers another $100,000 to punch up junior‚Äôs book sales?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Paul Ryan‚Äôs only objective was to gut Social Security. He left his position as speaker of the house with a 15% approval rating. Why is he still in politics?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thereidout Joy, which sitting Republican Senators? Why aren‚Äôt they coming out publicly? Are they afraid of trump or his base?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billhansen58 How does a Senator get re-elected with a 20% approval rating in a State that ranks four from the bottom in economy,education,healthcare?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whatever happened to intelligence and common decency? trump and Putin happened. Atlas should be thrown out of govt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why isn‚Äôt the media concentrating on the many ways the administration tried to suppress voting? Intimidation of poll workers and voters,blocking entrances to polls and highways,destroying postal machines and mail boxes. Joe Biden still became our President.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rmayemsinger It is our obligation to make sure ‚Äúnever again‚Äù is real for all humanity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbtucker Somebody forgot to tell them about separation of church and state.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheeEyeOfHorus What happened to no one is above the law? He also keeps saying he is in perfect health. If his crimes call for jail time, so be it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wouldn‚Äôt that make sense? Common sense has disappeared from this administration.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is this woman who is breaking the law not being fired. How did we ever get to a place where blatant criminality goes unpunished?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Do your job. This is a criminal act.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DevinCow @RudyGiuliani Love that cow!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh that is too funny. Does he have members besides himself?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan Woofie will like the left better. He says the right is old fashioned and makes him look like an old lady.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Probably orders from the boss.NBC why not concentrate on the Democratic Senators?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KimRuxton Your spelling is just fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSNBC_rocks_ Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We know!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is so frightening. People need stimulus money so they can stay home and protect their families and themselves. So many essential workers are sacrificing their lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan I wouldn‚Äôt bet against your diagnosis.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Didn‚Äôt the RNC think of vetting him before allowing him to be on a ballot.  https://t.co/U0Jeoi4Tzm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Is this man totally nuts. Why don‚Äôt the people of Florida have a giant recall? When President Biden is in the WhiteHouse maybe he will be able to do something for Floridians.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RexChapman Human kindness gets me every time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn‚Äôt that because so many Republicans are as cowardly and unimaginably stupid as a warped kid like Rittenhouse?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>De ar Speaker Pelosi, there are many on Twitter who say what Emily Murphy is doing is against the law. If so why is Congress not acting on this information? If not, why doesn‚Äôt Congress give President Biden the funds he needs for transition?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Thank you Angela Merkel. You are much admired for your dignity,integrity and intelligence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Warren_G_Regul8 @AmziQureshi Why do these news stations ask the opinions of idiots. Is MSNBC trying to compete with CNN for has beens?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Let‚Äôs just call him President Cool Joe. He has already made us so much more relaxed knowing that his priorities are in making a better America for all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Emily Murphy, don‚Äôt be intimidated do your job. We have a new President that you don‚Äôt have to fear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MysterySolvent This is amazing to watch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realTuckFrumper He only blamed the women.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OnniSifis @RKJ65 @LindseyGrahamSC @senatemajldr That sounds about right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Or Susan Collins<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Emily,this is a Federal Offense. You are obstructing justice at the highest level. It is your job to cooperate with the newly elected President‚Äôs transition. Do your job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is a must. So many judges were rated unqualified by the Bar Association.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Peter,do we have to inform Congress about this? A Federal Crime is huge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MickIrishMuslim They get crazier and crazier. This one is really around the bend.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>5 years is far too little for the breaking of an election law of this proportion. Voter suppression should never be allowed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenDuckworth @OMGno2trump The Justice Dept. is not allowed to send armed officers. These officers should disregard the orders of trump and Barr and obey the law. A real president would not encourage breaking another rule of law.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I hope it was reported and corrected. That‚Äôs a huge discrepancy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There really is no reason why these three keep their seats. Don‚Äôt Kentuckians know that their states always ranks incredibly low in every category? Economy,healthcare,education all in the mid to high 40% and never improves under McConnell. Why?? .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MarkJacob16 @usgloria To begin with I don‚Äôt understand why any person of any color would vote for trump. He encourages all white supremist,KKK,and Nazis groups to rise up against all Americans who want equality for all.  I agree when the lies come out the interview should end.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Reuters @CoWildlifePhoto @annsaphir trump will never understand economics that is why every one of his businesses went bankrupt. High stocks don‚Äôt necessarily mean jobs. Pumping up stocks with Fed money does mean bankruptcy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steve_pierce @CoWildlifePhoto Did your father say which of trump‚Äôs policies he agrees with? Not his trade deals,not his promise of healthcare,not his nowhere wall, not supporting dictators instead of US intelligence, not tax scam for rich only,not millions in emoluments,not firing health inspectors etc. what?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @TheresaBravo8 @realDonaldTrump Ronna ,you must have been watching the wrong station. The debate I saw showed trump calling out his white supremists and proud boys to keep up the intimidation and violence.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Marston4ca42 @JoeBiden Governor Evers has worked very hard to repair the damage that Scott Walker did to Wisconsin. trump has encouraged his base from other states to continue carnage against peaceful protestors.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JillWineBanks @kellycorfe Eric Holder has confirmed that a sitting president can be indicted. Nancy Pelosi, do it now before he destroys us all. Between Washington and New York there must be enough charges to put him away for life.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi Nancy Pelosi, please don‚Äôt let him walk away. A Federal offense gets removal a fine and jail time. If he doesn‚Äôt show up have him arrested. It‚Äôs the law.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PeteButtigieg @william51austin @KamalaHarris I am incredibly excited. This is a winning ticket. Everybody must vote to insure an overwhelming Blue Tsunami.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr Junior, we figured you would be the one to start because you don‚Äôt have a real job. You always let yourself be used like a simpleton.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SenatorSinema A payroll tax cut is not in the best interest of Americans. I hope people understand this. It furthers the GOP aim to cut into Social Security and Medicare.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnRJohnson @CorporatePiggie Mayor Lightfoot of Chicago has promised to arrest all storm troopers that hassle and kidnap the citizens of Chicago. Portland should do this as well. We cannot allow gestapo thugs in our cities.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilLowenthal1 Love your scripture and your picture. Cute.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adamcbest You're right Cruz. The minimum wage should never be below $32 an hour. That is what you meant isn't it Cruz? Nobody could possibly live on today's minimum wage.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MysterySolvent Chicago, tens of thousands of peaceful protesters to greet trump's storm troopers would be amazing. Singing would be good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MysterySolvent I hope the Mayor and Governor arrest any who hassle or kidnap protesters. It is against the law for these storm troopers to be in our cities. This is not Hitler's Germany. This is AMERICA!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MysterySolvent Like a frog.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickamin20 I want to see this Portland business stopped now before it spreads to other cities. Shouldn't this be something a Congressional investigation could do something about. We still have the first amendment. Don't we???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MalcolmNance @Lazarus1957 Mayors and local police should stand with and protect the peaceful protesters against these gestapo like federal people.

<|startoftext|>@GOPLeader Kevin, in case you have been out of the country for some time you must know that trump,the AG and the entire GOP have defied every rule of law without consequences. Obstruction,emoluments,sexual assault,money laundering etc.etc.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@glennkirschner2 Isn't it against the law for trump to fire Berman? He was appointed by a judicial group. Wasn't he? Can't Berman argue to the Supreme Court like trump does. Berman needs to stay until he completes all his investigations against those that want him out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilLowenthal1 Why aren't you playing nice with your brother? This stuff isn't going away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickamin20 I think Berman should speed up his prosecutions, whomever they are against before trump has time to push his buddy through the senate. Could Berman take this to Supreme Court and argue that he should stay until ongoing investigations concluded?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nickamin20 Impeach and arrest is just not going to happen even though he has flaunted every rule of law and thumbed his nose at the constitution.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilLowenthal1 Your biggest fear on a blind date.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid Where is the Congressional oversight. When did Congress give up its powers? Adam Schiff, America needs you to keep this ship from sinking. Congress is supposed to have equal authority with the Senate and the executive branch. What happened???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilLowenthal1 trump is so immoral he is probably hoping to incite a riot. I wish every Tulsa resident would stay home and boycot his rants.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LosAngeles1850 @MyraDSirois1 Larry Kudlow would like to see more trump a$$ kissing like he does. Mr.Powell cares about America and still has integrity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@24baseballReed @JayHart909 I'm sure the pockets of the trump family are bulging. What happened to oversight???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joncoopertweets If not this trump will find another reason to veto pay raises for our troops. He needs more money for his useless walls.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@senatemajldr A free and open society wouldn't tolerate your behavior the past eleven years. You have made it your mission to block every bill that would help anyone but the 1%. No gun laws, no election protection, no fair immigration laws, etc.etc.etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AudreyStJames1 trump inciting violence. Nothing new!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@katalva3 Is that trump's speech on race relations. Quote"I have a black friend"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realTuckFrumper Mitt probably only voted to impeach trump because he knew it wouldn't change the outcome.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JayHart909 And trump understands every word she says. Duh!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottImmordino The Republicans will never cut back on the huge perks for the 1% but they will steal our Social Security after bankrupting the Country to keep the stock market rising while the economy sinks.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@katalva3 @politico You can thank that miserable Kempand his cronies. A total setup to suppress the vote. 100% of Congress and Senate should fight for the right to vote. This is treason.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AidenWolfe Great facial description. 100% right about the recession.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thomaskaine5 @SheilaPaulsen1 The Federal Reserve is helping trump bankrupt the country. The only economy that is doing well is trump's 1% and their cronies.

<|startoftext|>@joncoopertweets When your Federal Govt. is so corrupt you have to find ways to protect your constituents with medical supplies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MysterySolvent trump's favorite people. UNEDUCATED !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realTuckFrumper Good people?.They look more like DeVos paid agitators. trump,call off your dogs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickamin20 @AC360 Congratulations Anderson Cooper. I'm sure this little guy will have a loving life. Enjoy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glennkirschner2 Glenn,can't the state police arrest the whole gang for bootlegging goods.? How about a sting operation?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpacialK3 Is Barr giving a huge OK for pretend military in camouflage to overrun a state building while carrying assault weapons??? Is this real or parody???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FreckledGirl6 Rand Paul's neighbor?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertCooper58 @Suzyqfit4u @realDonaldTrump Good girl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@djrothkopf @EmpathyNow That would show some sanity along with common sense gun laws like banning all assault weapons except for the military.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coleyworld He is indeed a moron.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr Junior, if you want to know about sexual assault ask daddy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katalva3 Why aren't the officers doing anything? This has to be stopped.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickamin20 This has to be stopped now. Every police force in every city has to work twice as hard because we have no common sense gun laws. When will they ban assault weapons and make sure there are background checks and mental checks before issuing guns.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilLowenthal1 Probably DeVos and her family stirring up fear in the American public. Assault weapons do not belong at a peaceful protest or anywhere<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSNBC_rocks_ Don't forget the allegations of rape of a 13 year old. This is not okay is it McConnell?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jim1036 Isn't there any law that says intimidating a Governor is a criminal act. Can't they be removed and arrested? trump says they are all responsible people. Responsible for what???Why doesn't the GOP ban assault war aprons now??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilLowenthal1 Maybe she lost a bet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenPolehanki Somebody,please explain to me why this is OK.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LeePappas4 @realTuckFrumper @senatemajldr Curious minds do want to know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CoreyMorrell2 @MollyJongFast The Governor should call local law enforcement and have them removed from State Property. This can't be legal. Can it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilLowenthal1 Doped and disorderly.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DaisyTom5 Total Bull!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilLowenthal1 Wasn't their somebody in trump's clan today who suggested giving everyone space suits so that we can open up the country? This must be the prototype.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Stop_Trump20 First smile todayüòä<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kenolin1 @DaisyTom5 Does trump know that his pal McConnell has one of the poorest mismanaged states for years.  If you know anything about economics you don't have multiple business bankruptcies including a casino.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KimRuxton The market is being pumped up by the fed while grossly increasing the debt. That's why countries become bankrupt while their leaders become rich. Manipulation!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickamin20 Amash, I don't think you are a practical or capable alternative. Why would you do this? Don't do this.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@justinamash Let's not do this. This is no time to do anything to jeopardize the saving of our democracy. Once the country is back to sanity and civility it will be time to rebuild the Republican Party, but now we need a Blue Tsunami. Why would you do this???<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DWUhlfelderLaw I'm not usually a conspiracy theorist, but you start to wonder if trump and pence have been injected with antibodies. They did know about the virus in November when they informed Isreal and NATO. Why else would Pence not follow Mayo's protocol??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nickamin20 Angie,you are so right. I can't remember the last time I felt safe in our country and it was long before the virus. When I see swastikas,torches, people walking around with assault weapons,losing our allies,watching all laws broken,courts corrupted.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nickamin20 If the govt. provided proper stimulus and encouraged the banks to suspend payments and just add to end of mortgage it wouldn't stop the trumpers but the people that need unemployment wouldn't have to worry about going to work to save their jobs.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@joncoopertweets Moscow Mitch, if the country was thinking of the growing debt it never would have allowed all the tax breaks for billionaires and millionaires which they are still doing. You look for excuses to steal from Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SenatorSinema Hopefully it didn't include the $90billion in additional tax breaks for the very rich. Thanks Senator for looking out for small business.

<|startoftext|>@juliaioffe @LouisRBridgema3 Well Eric, I know many who have asked for rent relief from banks and mortgage co.

<|startoftext|>@coffeeftwords donald trump resigned<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheTwerkingNun @MaryjaneMjmalin They are probably getting paid.  Why don't they protest not getting stimulus checks or small business loans going to big business? If they kiss trump's a$$ maybe he will listen to his cult members,but don't count on it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@toni_iacobbo Who is stuffing their pockets. I don't know one person who has received a stimulus check or one small business who has been able to get a payday loan. Ruth's Chris with 5,000 employees is not small business. Hedge fund operators are not small business.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@endinwell @MaryGeise @CyndiW100 That sounds like a trump move.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MaryGeise @Resistinfla It's disgusting when a state has to be careful that their much needed supplies aren't stolen and rerouted by their own govt. trump thinks he's a bootlegger from Capone's era. These supples are for survival!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LeePappas4 @JohnTrumpSucks @PalmerReport @SkartveitNancy Wouldn't we all like to know. Somebody in trump's office also notified NATO in November. trump being so smart couldn't possibly not know what was happening in his own office. That would be the ipidomy of stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickamin20 That was so great. I have to go watch it again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katalva3 Another $90 Billion in tax cuts should not be in this bill. There must  be more oversight by the congress. Too much was given to big business leaving very little for small.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Rubio, you forgot to mention that most of the small business ones went to big business. You also forgot tGIP want $90Billion dollars in the bill as more tax breaks for millionaires. Can't you read Rubio??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realTuckFrumper Eric's wife is also getting Secret Payments. I'm sure she said "if junior's girlfriend gets paid,why can't I?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dianesbaker1 @JohnDiGiovanni9 Eric trump ripped off St.Jude Charity. Was banned from participating  in other New York charities. Went to "stop cheating classes" with his sister Ivanka. Did they learn anything??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jilevin Making sure only big business gets paycheck loans,writing a huge tax break for millionaires into the stimulus package, taking over $500,000 dollars from army to build a wall. Isn't oversight supposed to stop this stuff?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jilevin I sure hope  https://t.co/Z5YWKOTcAs one in this administration is not scamming. trump and Kushner throwing money at companies they are involved in. Paying a bankrupt company $50 million dollars for pretend supplies.Making states bid for supplies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Public_Citizen @PattyArquette trumpers,republicans, people listen up. While you are waiting patiently for unemployment or your $1200 stimulus check millionaires will get an additional $90 billion tax cut. Do you really think this administration is working for you???<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realTuckFrumper $15 an hour bad actors compared to Rosa Parks a woman of integrity is an assinine comparison. With stupid White House advisors like Stephen Moore it's no wonder the White House is so disheveled  and cartoonish.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realTuckFrumper Bi think his cancer reached his brain.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilLowenthal1 These people make me physically ill. The ones in Michigan were waving flags with swastikas. What is wrong with the republicans that they could see what is happening and not lift a finger to stop it?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tribelaw @wandainparis Doesn't this tell us that it's time to ignore any ruling by the Supreme Court. If they can't rule on common sense in a pandemic none of their rulings should be considered at all. Governors,Mayors, Constituents fire trump's slaves.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DoctorHenryCT @PaulLidicul Ludicrous, no time for trump's misdeeds but one day to send Wisconsinites to risk their lives to vote. A lower court had already ruled trump had to reveal his financials. Why is the Supreme Court not upholding that decision???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tlccourville Only a republican would fully clothe himself in personal protective gear ( which most people can't get) and tell people to go out in a crowd and vote. Quote(it's perfectly safe).<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nickamin20 @realDonaldTrump @GOP I am totally disgusted that 5 Supreme Court Justices would not let Gov.Evers postpone the election and arrange to have mail in ballots. What made these monsters what they are?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@uvotguy @joncoopertweets I'm with you Thomas. Until the Republicans are all out of office there will be no rule of law. What happened in Wisconsin today was despicable. Election should have been postponed. I have to admire those that braved the pandemic to cast their vote.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CJ_isnowblue The Supreme Court is now a republican shill. Justice Ginsburg must be as appalled as the American public by what has happened to a once respected non partisan group. No time to consider trump's misdeeds but 1 day to take away Wisconsin's right to vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DukeStevens2 @sandi_childs @awelab1956 @maggieNYT @Tam_Resist Why don't reporters get their information from reliable sources such as the CDC and the WHO?

<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman Ronna, you are an incredibly stupid woman. Don't you realize that it  is not safe to be in crowded places? Wisconsin could have a fair election if they arranged to vote by mail or postponed until June.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realTuckFrumper Kavanaugh,we are in the middle of a world crisis. Why would you block Wisconsin from postponing and having a proper election??Why would you and your cohorts do this??The Supreme Court of the US should have integrity and common sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benwikler I can't quite get my head around the fact that the Supreme Court has five completely dishonorable justices on it. Justice. Ginsburg must be totally appalled by the lack of common sense and common decency.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@allison_ramone @POTUS The dismantling of govt. agencies that were prepared to handle pandemics is a crime against humanity. No words for the sadness<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@B52Malmet trump knows how to go bankrupt and that is what he is doing to America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B52Malmet Isn't the Fed pouring 1 trillion dollars a day into the market to keep it from crashing??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilLowenthal1 @danagould Since Scott Walker was ousted the Wisconsin GOP is doing everything in its power to stop Gov. Evers from dong his job. There is no reason not to postpone this election and arrange for constituents to vote by mail.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SenatorLoeffler Loeffler, the main bone of contention was trump wanting to personally be in charge of trillions of dollars with no oversight.

<|startoftext|>@BuddyWinston @DelightfulDrD The Dow is probably responding to the one trillion dollar a day that trump is dumping into the market. That is why there is no money for ventilators,tests and. Medical supplies. What's a bunch of gradparents compared to the stock market????<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@tokitaeII trump is not helping Americans. A president actually tells Governors they have to fend for themselves and to fight each other for medical supplies that should be allocated by FEMA. Is he going to send our medical supplies to N.Korea for a price?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRynheart Dr. Fauci,trump embarrasses himself. He doesn't need help. Keep telling the truth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill Do something for the people, not the corporations. Now is not the time to say this is not how govt. works. Govt. is not working. Action is needed now. Ignore trump and the senate the way they overrun congress.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill Speaker Pelosi,I think it's time for congress to disperse money to the makers of tests,masks and ventilators and other medical equipment without waiting for trump to say OK. This is an emergency. Work with the governors quickly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmfa This woman is delusional. Is it drugs,alcohol or just fox?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@travisakers The hair dryer manufacturers will be thrilled to know they have a cure for the Coronavirus.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@katalva3 Hospitals are waiting and Dr. Offices are having an awful time getting tests and diagnosing quickly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CJ_isnowblue I'm sure there are many who would be positive if they had the luxury of being tested. Was he symptomatic?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katalva3 No arguments from me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BagdMilkSoWhat trump has abandoned all responsibility for our nation. He is busy offering help to NKorea. Sick,sick,sick.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kurtfollower @DavidCornDC @BobbyCr48838634 Why do Ford and General Motors need permission from trump to build ventilators? The are not govt. owned. Are they? This is an emergency!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lisastark351 How were they able to get tested so quickly when the rest of the country cannot? If Amazon has face masks why are they not giving them to medical workers and high risk people? Some on line 1 pack for $34. Gouging??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilLowenthal1 I'm sure most school kids are spending their time watching Rue Paul. Much more authentic than the Coronavirus report with trump and pence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ybarrap This really is bull. In an emergency. Governors should work side by side with fema and companies manufacturing medical supplies. This is no time for a bidding war.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RedTRaccoon You cannot suspend constitutional right. The DOJ should know that is grounds for removal.Congress cannot allow this to happen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandyRainbow It's getting bluer all the time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickamin20 Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katalva3 It's been alleged that trump has started a bidding war between Governors for medical supplies that should be available for all states at minimal cost. For the record,your name for him is my favorite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KimRuxton He promoted donating to pastors. You know. Like Paula White.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drdave1999 That looks about right.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ResisterForever Pure evil.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HillaryClinton Hillary, how about getting all governors together and discussing and coming up with a plan to get vital medical equipment to all states. Can't Congress pay companies directly? This is an emergency and we need expediency. You can do this Mdm. Pres.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenWolfe Keep calling Pence out my friend. The fact that he encourages people to make rich pastors richer makes me sick. People, if you want to donate try homeless shelters,soup kitchens,people who have lost their jobs,there are many ways to help.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickamin20 I think his practice was limited to doll hospitals. Brain surgeon??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CJ_isnowblue Not one word. It's too frightening. I wish they would boot his whole group off the air and let the scientists and medical professionals do their thing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AudreyStJames1 I can picture it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SenatorSinema Gov. Ducey, it's time to start fighting for some testing kits and ventilators for Arizona.  Ask the WHO to send kits directly to Arizona.

<|startoftext|>@nickamin20 Please keep retweeting. trump is no hero and should certainly not be commended for every awful act since the start of the virus.

<|startoftext|>@ScottImmordino Because the market is sooooo good. According to trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FreckledGirl6 This says a lot, doesn't it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Lindsey, do you cal 77 tests in a week and taking another $500Billion from the Fed to try and stem the free fall of the market a very good roadmap? Are you one of the uneducated that he loves??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LadyJYYC @MyraDSirois1 In an emergency can't Congress release funds to the specific medical facilities without being blackmailed by the Senate???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BruceBartlett @MyraDSirois1 It's a Putin philosophy. The uneducated are easier to manipulate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSNBC @QueenAwezome Dr. Fauci, why is the US not excepting testing kits from the WHO??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gatekeepken @nypapajoe They have the two worst Senators. Vote Blue!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ewarren trump only wants a man like Jared who can help him figure out how to scam more pocket money from this pandemic. Keep trying Senator Warren. We appreciate your efforts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilLowenthal1 If you like free speech,how can you vote for a Republican? You could go on all day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realTuckFrumper Why start now? You've been doing nothing much for eleven years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 Pence, would some of those people be you and your boss?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpacialK3 This nut case is sweating like a pig.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CJ_isnowblue Thanks for the fact checking. He lies so much I can't keep up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilLowenthal1 Move over Sean Spicer!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jilevin Credible Edible‚ò∫Ô∏è<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SheriAWilkinson Voting Blue should be every American's priority. We basically have to do the job the GOP Senate refused to do. We need sanity and intelligence in the White House.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@psychdr100 Is he taking over from Pence? I thought trump made Pence the virus task force chief.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@uvotguy @LincolnsBible @JustAGirl515 I'll buy that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drdave1999 He sounds like he is stoned. Is he?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@QuakerNana Congratulations to all. Enjoy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenWolfe I love when you make me laugh. Not too much is funny these days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@56blackcat @MyraDSirois1 Eric, how much did he pay you to say that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SSWorks @mgunnar45 Speaker Pelosi, please keep an eye on trump and his grifters. Do not let him steal from our Social Security or Medicare. Keep retweeting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidsanger @davidaxelrod I hope Milwaukee does refuse to issue a permit. They won't get paid anyway.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oneminutecall Read the whole tweet and vote blue no matter who. Nobody really needs a boat. Great thread.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanielKurle You must vote blue no matter who. We have to take back the justice department the health dept. , keep our social security and Medicare, remove DeVos. MnNuchin, Barr, Stephen Miller etc.  No vote is a vote for Putin and trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jim1036 Did they lock him up or is he hanging out waiting for a pardon?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilLowenthal1 Candace, we will talk about this when you are 76.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottImmordino It must have been some party!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Raultriathlon Somebody should pass a bill to fire incompetent govt. workers. Wasn't that in the constitution?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottImmordino @myworldmysun @cgogam Please tell me those people are paid actors and this is part of "my cartoon president"  These nuts can't be for real. Can they??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@uvotguy Cute.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Philipmarks87 I did too. But it really was stupid. Haven't smoked I. Twenty years but I would still like to hear those sounds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@noitsleviOsah Agreed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jim1036 If he was smart he would keep a low profile. Maybe we would forget about his Epstein escapades.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoniqueOMadan @EmpathyNow @DOJPH @DOJ_EOIR Why would any judge of any type follow an order to not inform people of the virus. This is criminal. Isn't it??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maziehirono Sen.Mazie Hirono, we need you to be the Senate Majority leader. You would help America to have free and fair elections.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OFemmeFataleZ @HeatherHale88 @kimguilfoyle @DonaldJTrumpJr Lara trump allegedly launders also.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nypapajoe Congress should have their own group of intelligence officers as trump's intelligence chief does not work for America, only works for trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MysterySolvent Junior,why would anybody want to debate you on anything. You are nothing. Hunter isn't running for office. Hunter isn't running against you. You really need to find a job.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Kate17Kazoo @pesterplarson3 If this is true follow the money and arrest the perpetrators.  Can individual hospitals and labs buy the testing kits from the WHO for $17? If not, why not?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KevinMKruse @MyraDSirois1 You can't watch this seriously. Is she a bad stand up comic?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickamin20 If the judge doesn't hold Barr in contempt if he refuses the order can't Congress have hold Barr in contempt and arrest him??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CJ_isnowblue @Deadpool650 Homemade sanitizer is fine. It's really just as effective..<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CJ_isnowblue Thanks CJ. That's simple enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mdnij34 I do. He dismantled crucial govt. health departments and removed many scientists in key positions. He also refused the testing kits offered by the WHO. Total incompetence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump I'm sure this is parody.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickamin20 @glennkirschner2 Taking more and more money from the Fed to prop up the market will bankrupt the country. He is an expert at bankruptcy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realTuckFrumper Junior,what would be the subject of your debate? Following in daddy's footsteps? Who never worked for a living? Lack of intelligence and integrity? Scamming from children's charities? I guess you would win!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@impeach_45NOW Health officials should do what they think is right.!!! trump is not a health professional.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@44mmvvpp You left out Pence,MnNuchin and Stephen Miller. Anybody else??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andylassner Bill Gates, please make them affordable. I'm sure this administration will stop Medicare and insurance companies from paying for the test. Thank you Bill Gates!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@drdave1999 Only the best.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRickWilson He's such a dork. I can twist him around my little finger. Even with the beard he still looks like my son.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cafael1 @CJ_isnowblue He has been cleaning out the federal treasury to manipulate the stock market. He will bankrupt the country the way he bankrupted all his businesses but this time it will be "we the people" that get stiffed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CJ_isnowblue He has a plan for reducing the national debt. Stealing our Social Security and Medicare savings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FreckledGirl6 This is sooooo good! We have to keep working hard to flip the senate and keep the house.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilLowenthal1 Why would anybody ask him? You would think he's a doctor or something.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katalva3 It looks like a graveyard to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden @MyraDSirois1 Joe Biden, make that a vocal promise in your next public speech. We as Americans need to know this is not just campaign chatter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HoodlumRIP @Suzyqfit4u @DawnNovelli @BloodwingBX @FrancisWegner @Acyn We needed that. Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pol1tically No reason to disagree. Mark Meadows as well and since we are name calling I'll add Jim Jordan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ResisterForever Why did the US refuse the test kits recommended by the WHO??? Can we still get them? We can't sit around and wait for a company that allegedly trump may have a financial stake in to make them. There is a WHO for a reason. To save lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorskLadyWolf Our military commanders should do everything they can to fight this virus as they see fit. trump's message should not interfere with military medical personnel.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DanielKurle Seeing trumpers with white sheets and hoods or waving flags with swastikas, and children taken and not returned to their families makes me wonder how anybody could support or vote for this atrocity. People okay with this astounds me.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nickamin20 It made me laugh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@uvotguy @MysterySolvent @raidergyrl Good answer.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tribelaw Because he is two faced and untrustworthy. The new breed of republican. No morals, no opinions,just rubber repub stamps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realTuckFrumper Which two? Did they quarantine the whole lot of them till they were tested?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katalva3 Who's concerned? Susan Collins?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickamin20 Aw,if dogs could talk<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@drdave1999 That's really,really horrendous!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandyRainbow Do it Randy. Pence,MnNuchin and Kudlow with a little input from Mrs. Goebels Miller. I love your videos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SheriAWilkinson In a sane environment with honest trustworthy republicans it might have been a thing but the way things are Voting Blue for Pres.,Congress and the Senate is the only way to restore democracy and the rule of law. Corruption must be ousted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilLowenthal1 It is possible if they stick to today's issues and don't keep bringing up past acts. Times change, people change and opinions change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilLowenthal1 @RNC Bring back Donna Brazille. She will deal with Rona.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ps9714 Two faces. One schmo.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DanielKurle @CJ_isnowblue You did tell us so. I'm always optimistic and he sounded so sincere. My mistake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@virginia_true @SpacialK3 @wtp__2020 Vote him out. He has not been working since Pres. Obama was elected.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realTuckFrumper Let's start with you, you  https://t.co/y89zhr3cww do people like you get public access?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realTuckFrumper Wasn't there a rumor that he was going to Nashville today to assess the tornado damage. They need help now.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AidenWolfe I think it's a troll or needs those comprehension lessons.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CJ_isnowblue Warren is so far his superior in every respect. He is full of bull.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MikeBloomberg @sparky347v Mike Bloomberg, the greatest video yet. Keep them coming. Thanks from "we the people"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilLowenthal1 Why would anybody who has looked up Rand Paul's voting record ever vote for this parasite. The only thing he voted yes on was the tax scam for the rich.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B52Malmet All great questions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@briantylercohen @DebraMessing Michael Bloomberg you will be a huge help in saving our democracy. Thank you!!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Heidi_Cuda @joncoopertweets I agree. So much intelligence to draw from.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@uvotguy @iThinkBuzz @KamalaHarris Actually I will vote blue no matter who and I hope every democrat and independent does the same. I would also welcome republicans who value their freedoms to vote blue too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottImmordino Junior,you are comical.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@eclecticbrotha You are funny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kurtfollower @SenatorCollins Roberts lost the respect of most Americans over his mishandling of the impeachment trial. Sotomayor and Ginsburg are admired for speaking truth to power.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nickamin20 @donnabrazile She was great!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CJ_isnowblue trump and his economic geniuses should know that we all know you don't cut rates when the economy is good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilLowenthal1 Susan Collins has a baffling sense of humor or she is that unconscious .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realTuckFrumper You can wash it down with Bakker's silver solution. I'm sure Pence and his medical team would appreciate this cons input.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AdamParkhomenko Donna Brazille, that was fabulous!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@erniefay @glennkirschner2 It was obvious to all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenWolfe Warren is a great choice. Shame is a wasted emotion.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@psychdr100 @voxdotcom As we all should be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realTuckFrumper Why would pence discuss the virus with non medical senators? Is he going to tell them if they hear anything important they are not allowed to convey information to their constituents?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@drdave1999 Thank you Amy. Stay in politics.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CJ_isnowblue @moed313 @RichieFed That should be every American's priority. A blue tsunami is needed to override the cheating and election abuses by the GOP. Vote Blue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilLowenthal1 Why didn't they take him straight to jail? He could have spent some time incarcerated before trump files the paperwork for his undeserved pardon.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Malinowski @MyraDSirois1 @SecPompeo Won't any of his advisors tell him this is a really bad idea? Is it another direct order from Putin? Putin wants to make Assad happy not trump.

<|startoftext|>@glennkirschner2 @erniefay Hey Congress, do it yourself! Now! This administration has broken every law and now is acting like we are a dictatorship. The power of the Congress is not just for show. Use it,please!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi Speaker Pelosi, can't Congress hold a meeting tomorrow with scientists and Doctors and by Monday be able to coordinate medical workers and fund what they need immediately. Not asking to build and staff a hospital in 10 days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bois1234 Fire DeVos. She needs to go. She has stolen money from students who's debt was forgiven. She is getting funds for a school with no address,no faculty and no students it has been alleged. She has no experience in education.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>DeVos   I voted to #FireDeVos‚Äîshe needs to go!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jim1036 We have to remind ourselves to double vet any person running for an electable govt. position. These three had plenty of luggage that should have rendered them unelectable.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@raphaelha67 @katalva3 Hopefully.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katalva3 Hopefully they are just there for the $15dollars an hour that they will never see. It isn't about him. It's for the children,for democracy and the rule of law. We need intelligence,honesty and empathy in our leaders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katalva3 Lol. Thanks!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickamin20 Saw the opening episode. I think it's going to get really interesting with the assortment of characters. Don't think it's for binge watching. One hour at a time should do it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@drdave1999 @PaulDereume Is Dr Fauci a govt. employee? If not trump is not his boss and e cannot lose his job. Dr.Fauci is a free citizen who can speak up and inform America what is he best way to handle a medical emergency. We are still a Democracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilLowenthal1 He'll never get a job but I like him regardless.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RepGaramendi @debiowens Ca. and every other state should use whatever resources they have to test for the Coronavirus. Governors, Mayors, Health Professionals contact the WHO to help provide test kits. trump's health squad(Pence,MnNuchin,Kudlow) is a bad joke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Isellmpls @SpacialK3 Isn't it part of any workers job to try to stop incompetence when it is seen? Why should anyone be persecuted for trying to right a wrong?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast Cruz, it's you and the republicans that want to stifle our unions. You really never know what your talking about. Are you embarrassed to have turned into a tool??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DearAuntCrabby I won't touch Soc.Sec. or Medicare<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeTakei If trump shows up he will be demonstrating the latest in hazmat suits.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankFigliuzzi1 @kurtfollower We are not a dictatorship as yet. I hope public health officials disregard trump's over stepping his power and inform the public what they need to know to stay safe. Pence,MnNuchin and Kudlow just won't do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MickIrishMuslim Rob Portman is cracked<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorLoeffler @CDCDirector @POTUS @SenatorTimScott @SenJohnHoeven Senator Loeffler, if you actually listened to trump's speech you would no that he is screwing up this medical emergency big time. He put no experience Pence in charge who chose MnNuchin and Kudlow as assistants. Also. Know nothings. Wake up girl.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMarkMeadows Meadows, you must not know that America always had provisions for a pandemic until trump dismantled them. Inform Junior. Maybe he can talk to daddy about restoring our resources.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@psychdr100 How stupid is this??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickamin20 @tribelaw That would be in a common sense administration. DrFauci still has his first amendment rights. I hope he uses them to help us navigate this disease intelligently.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realTuckFrumper It's about time somebody locked her up. Her only consequence for money lost on school with no faculty,students or professors will be the same as for stealing money that was forgiven from students. They fined the dept. of education not her personally.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MysterySolvent Somebody knowledgeable would tell the truth. Pence will just parrot what he's told.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@psychdr100 @politicususa I wish this were parody.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CJ_isnowblue It's bad enough to have trumpers for Justices, now we have to pay the wives to be spies? Is this for real?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tribelaw Sotomayor has the courage " see something, say something" She will not let this administration corrupt the highest court in the land. Every Justice has taken an oath to defend our country. Justice Sotomayor is living up to that oath.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@campbellitstrue That is off the wall.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MysterySolvent The dismantling of our Democracy.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ScottImmordino children and refuses to give them back. These are not fruits and vegetables,they are people. When is it time for an international group to intervene and arrest him for crimes against humanity? How do you steal children from their families?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickamin20 @RadioFreeTom @soledadobrien @Politisite @gtconway3d @michaelharriot @ava I agree. I'm always fact checking and looking up new words.

<|startoftext|>@psychdr100 Lindsey, why don't you investigate yourself? I'm sure even fox viewers would be interested to know why a Russian Oligarch gave you $800,000.00. Tell it to MSM too. Many of us don't watch fox.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottImmordino Who raised these abominations?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottImmordino He also pulled a Houdini with trade deals,health care and tax cuts. He is spouting the same promises now. Don't be fooled a second time. This time he wants our Soc.Sec.and Medicare.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nypapajoe He only helps large corporate farmers. Small family farms go bankrupt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottImmordino That is called Current Events.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glennkirschner2 The only way to stop this hijack of our democracy is to remove trump and Barr. Impeach again and retry quickly. Maybe enough of the senate has come to their senses. Remove McConnell for dereliction of duty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@renato_mariotti Why aren't more of the Supreme Court Justices trying to protect our Democracy? Why did they not immediately insist that trump had to turn over his financials to congress? The Supreme Court should not be doing special favors for trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenKamalaHarris @NancySinatra How does anyone condone the horrors that Stephen Miller has initiated? Some of his own family were victims of the holocaust. Many members of his family will have nothing to do with him. He suggested putting migrants on trains to scare them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AidenWolfe She was great tonight.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SafetyPinDaily @pcoop125 How much does she have to wash before she is removed? Does she have a quota?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nowthisnews @SpacialK3 Good luck Jessica!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenBright This woman needs to be removed from any political office. Fining the dept. of education for her misdeeds is not nearly enough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nypapajoe I say impeach and remove for abuse of power!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ewarren Senator Warren, you used to talk about regulating credit card companies so they could not charge exorbitant interest. This would be a great talking point. Good luck in tonight's debate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peabody007 Ladies, are your brains as frozen as your faces? Women's rights need to be protected.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NeilLowenthal1 We still would like to know why a Russian Oligarch gave Lindsey $800,000. Are they that generous???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahKZhou @allison_ramone President Jimmy Carter is a man to respect and emulate. Truly a fine human being.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JackieFarnham @uvotguy He has been blocking everything since President Obama was elected. I really don't know why he is getting paid. "we the people" have been paying him unemployment for the last 11 1/2 years,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PattyArquette If they weren't paid in advance, who knows?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeilLowenthal1 Is typical of today's GOP!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ScottImmordino Isn't Betsy DeVos collecting more Govt. funds for another university without a school or a faculty. When will this ungodly woman be arrested?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@psychdr100 Isn't it time for the New York police to pick him up on various charges? There is no reason a sitting president cannot be indicted. Bail should be out of the question. Too many foreign connections.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nypapajoe @nytimes Incarceration should not be postponed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RandyRainbow Great as usual. Should be on net flicks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenMcSallyAZ With no respect at all McSally the Fed is manipulating the market at trump's direction.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kitchen5203 @ScottImmordino Sooo sorry. Didn't read the whole tweet. I agree 110%.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kitchen5203 @ScottImmordino This is probably a ploy to get tulsi Gabbard  votes.  I hope the Repubs don't follow for this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottImmordino I'm sure big money was involved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nypapajoe He should resign. Every time I hear that word "troubling" I think of Susan Collins.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Oregonamis @Unconquerable You would think by now the trump camp would quit telling lies at world conferences. The rest of the world knows about our manipulated economy and how our freedoms are being. Infringed on. Only trump's base believes the garbage from this administration .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yobeav @Stop_Trump20 Isn't it hard to believe there are those who would still send this fraudulent garbage their hard earned money??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@yashar @adamcbest Amy, if you are on the board of border and immigration would you please tell us about any improvements that have been made for those suffering in the camps. Has ICE turned into an armed militia of our servicemen?? We need updates as Americans.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CaslerNoel @ericsslater @realDonaldTrump Isn't it documented that in the early nineties it was said he had pedophelia and somewhere there is a record of him molesting 10 and 12 yr. olds. Boys and girls. I heard that he had to pay large amounts to their parents. Is this true? Anybody?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottImmordino Speaker Pelosi,trump is said to be going to deploy heavily armed border patrol to use in sanctuary cities and other immigrants along borders. Is this true? If true what can Congress do about it? We can't turn America into police states.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nickamin20 These ignorant congressmen and senators are supposed to represent the people. Every poll showed at least 75% of the people wanted trump removed. We the people should be allowed to remove all who did not represent us.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@funder Americans find trump guilty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@45rapedkatie5 If he is a criminal(which this one is) of course he should be removed from office before he causes any more damage. I heard there are more states than just New York that want him for multiple crimes.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realTuckFrumper This should be expected of anyone wanting to save democracy. Especially a Democrat with a chance to vote. It's bad enough the entire GOP is corrupt, hopefully all democrats will vote to convict so that trump can't holler it's bipartisan.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CJ_isnowblue You have a lot of fans Ed. Good work.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorSinema The only plan that trump has for health care is to make cuts in Medicare and Medicaid. He also has done nothing to lower prescription costs. You didn't need trump's support to get elected and you don't need it now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorSinema Sinema,if this is the parental leave bill that Ivanka was touting it stinks. It basically takes retirement money from workers social security to pay for it. We depend on these funds to help us have a retirement.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AudreyStJames1 Very well put.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillEaster12 trump has seen to it that there is no federal election commission. He has reduced their numbers so there is not enough for a vote. What do we do now lawyers?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jennobenno It's time to show Rand Paul that he is not above the law. I appeal to Justice Roberts to insist he be taken out and arrested. No pardons allowed for this outright flaunting of the rule of law.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillEaster12 Shall we start with Betsy DeVos! Maybe escort services? How about inappropriate massage parlors. Maybe Epstein's little black books.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AP @HRTsAFyre Over 2,000 lawyers signed a petition that basically states that trump is not above the law. Lawyers, get together and find a way to not allow these assinine steps by the administration which puts trump and his cohorts (judges included) above the law.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nevermore_007 @Resistinfla I already know the state of the union. Listening to lies won't change it.

<|startoftext|>@ScottImmordino This is why Moscow Mitch and trump like the uneducated. They can convince them that the deficit has nothing to do with the huge tax scam for the 1%.

<|startoftext|>@jilevin Knowing that in today's polls 75% of all Americans wanted witnesses and documents how can these republican senators say they represent their constituents?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MaraGay @joncoopertweets Murkowski, it's not the congress that failed. It's the GOP in the senate that admits trump's guilt but fails to remove him. You watched criminals, (Sekulow and Dershowitz) defend a criminal and did nothing to save our democracy. Shame on you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nickamin20 @todd_poirier I have a hard time finding any good behavior in the judges appointed by trump. Most were judged unqualified by their peers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickamin20 Why in the world would someone want to stop a woman from having a child. This is one unjust judge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jilevin Also stagnant wages and the rise in consumer costs.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TrueFactsStated Isn't this statement enough for an impeachment and removal. He is blatantly letting America know that the election WILL be interfered with.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kurteichenwald @senatemajldr @LindseyGrahamSC @Scotus I don't believe the Chief Justice will support perjury. McConnell and Graham must be excluded from impeachment proceedings.<|endoftext|>

Give the money back or man up. The blackmail couldn't be worse than what they are doing to America!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottImmordino McConnell, why don't you retire and enjoy your millions and tell the GOP it's alright to honor their oath to America and the constitution.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bill_Maxwell_ This is great!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bill_Maxwell_ The only reason you could possibly be behaving in this abominable way is because you have no feelings for your children or grandchildren. Why else would you leave them the kind of world that you and trump are trying to create?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ebinsmile @UsaPirate How could any Democrat not want to save our democracy? What is wrong with you people? This man and his administration have placed themselves above the law. Vote him out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid Wouldn't that be reason enough to remove McConnell. He is blatantly admitting that he has fixed the courts. Practically every judge that has been appointed has been rated unqualified by the American Bar Association.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickamin20 I still think they should be able to indict a sitting president. A memo is not a law. The NY AG should be able to indict the whole trump crime family. They steal from charities and get away with a fine. Anyone else would go to jail. The kids go to don't steal school!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fras99 Ditto!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CJ_isnowblue This is deplorable. Taking food from those in need so he can play more golf,send Jared on monkey business trips etc.etc.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@glennkirschner2 They won't have any defense. They will keep yelling hoax and witch hunt. They know less about the law than I and I know nothing. I count on you Glenn to help me understand what they can and can't do.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RepAdamSchiff @kechjo Adam Schiff, no pressure  but trump has to impeached and removed for his many crimes. We need to be a country of laws. We cannot allow a dictator to take away the freedoms so many have fought to maintain. Thank you for your persistence and loyalty to country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOP @IvankaTrump It's another trump tactic to leverage families by making them borrow from their retirement funds. Don't trust a trump. Investigate and read everything. Ask questions.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@joncoopertweets Alleged rape,stealing from not one but two charities which the trump family admitted to, should be crimes worthy of impeachment,removal and possibly incarceration. Why can this group get away with blatant crimes???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CraigRozniecki Lindsey,you still haven't told the American people why a Russian Oligarch gave you $800,000. You are not that cute.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Amy_Siskind @Teatakin14team1 @CBSNews That is great.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast Good question. Why was trump only charged with a civil crime regarding stealing from a charity? Why is ignoring subpoenas not penalized? Why is junior not arrested for outing whistleblower? So many questions,no answers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coleyworld That's a good one.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@vespertilioAJR @kurtfollower He knows everybody knows so what's the big deal? Maybe there was a quid pro quo! Did Lindsey do something for the $800,000? Was it just because he was so well liked? Hmmm,.....<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ECMcLaughlin I'm sure that trump wanted this to happen to make way for Russian hacking of American cyber security.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArtistsPo Parody. Right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarthaMcSally McSally,we need your input on the crisis on the border. What will you propose to make things better. We also need to know where you stand on common sense gun control.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OMGno2trump In reality he will be impeached and removed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PamKeithFL I'll buy that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MysterySolvent Seditious<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@siano4progress Breaching a secured area. Having a cell phone in a secured area. Federal. Crimes. Should be arrested and prosecuted.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Philipmarks87 I would make time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xtrixcyclex @B_P_Vanderburg @HouseGOP These childish republicans should be expelled from the house.Gaetz  should face criminal charges as should others with cell phones in a secured area.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@joncoopertweets More of the very best people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realTuckFrumper @mgunnar45 Matt Gaetz and his goons have breached national security. This is a major crime. He should be removed and arrested immediately.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattOswaltVA @GeorgeTakei You now see the picture of a real ass and his spineless cohorts. Capitol Police where are you? We need adults in Congress and the Senate. These goons know nothing of the constitution and the workings of the govt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MoLulkowski @SpacialK3 @GOP Nancy,make sure all cell phones are confiscated by the Sargent of Arms before these wing nuts are allowed to leave the secure area!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Delavegalaw @MyraDSirois1 Call the Capital Police and drag them out. This is obscene,childish and unacceptable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RRPatLaw @KennysLittleBro @RepAdamSchiff Nancy, you cannot let Gaetz and his goons get away with this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRickWilson @MyraDSirois1 What has he done to our troops? The Kurds are rightfully upset, Syria,Turkey and Russia don't want American troops there. Iraq doesn't want them. Bring them home out of harms way. You have placed them in an impossible situation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickamin20 His crimes are overwhelming<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fxp123 Why were the Capital Police not called to restore order and remove the intruders?#<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nypapajoe Only four?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waltshaub I can't imagine any elected official being fine with what trump and his appointees are doing to our country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ida_skibenes Bacon bits. Everything is better with bacon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottImmordino Barr's job is one giant coverup. There will be no justice until he is removed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eyeofthegoddess It sounds like a threat!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill Lindsey, why don't you quit being the fool? Who is putting you up to this nonsense?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottImmordino The GOP must admit they can't tolerate a senator who does not know what is in the constitution. Vote Blue!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@4a_of Good luck with the surgery. You have a fantastic day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSNBC_rocks_ Time to recycle? Who else is at the bottom of the barrel?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump @SecPompeo What are you and Pompeo going to do there? Inquiring minds want to know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pebbles_9010 @Lazarus1957 No doubt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Infantry0300 Get the gestapo out of our govt. This is too much.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ECMcLaughlin @maddow Mike Pence, most Americans want to save their democracy, they want to know that their elections are honest, they want sanity in our govt. and dignity. Loyalty for our allies and pride for our military.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sahilkapur @LisainNJUSA Mo Brooks, it's a good thing you weren't under oath when you told trump there was no evidence of an impeachable offense or you would be committing perjury.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@joncoopertweets Is she allowed to just ignore the Hatch Act? No accountability?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast Lindsey, I can't tell if you are that stupid or just pretending. House Democrats are following due process to a T. Did you forget everything you learned from Clinton's impeachment???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rath_22 @MSNBC_rocks_ @HuffPostPol If he had told you to jump off the Empire State Building would you do it because trump said it was the law? I'm assuming you know right from wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@uvotguy @ottawatts I will vote blue no matter who even though I have my preferences.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ttommyunger @MSNBC_rocks_ Child sex trafficking should not be swept under the rug. All should be held accountable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidJollyFL It's self evident. trump speaks for itself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BY1959 @MSNBC_rocks_ McConnell, why didn't you do this before it was after the fact? The damage inflicted on the Kurds,on our troops, and on our country cannot be reversed. What is your next brilliant idea???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenWolfe I love when you make me laugh out loud. Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@resistandgrow Barr is behaving like a ranting TV evangelist. Why did Notre Dame invite him to speak?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickamin20 @GOP @realDonaldTrump If their constituents didn't agree I would think the only thing they could do is not reelect him. Hopefully most constituents will want to see trump removed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CATHERINENEVER2 Wishes for a speedy recovery President Carterüíï<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SherylNYT @mgunnar45 @tedcruz Another ditz that never read the constitution.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@_SJPeace_ That is one happy kid. Bravo Mom!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottImmordino What trump has done to the migrants,the Kurds and our Democracy,makes impeachment sound like a walk in the park. Why doesn't he resign before causing more damage??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@McGeezer67 @capnkirk1701 These three zealots are morally bankrupt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@shannongailmc @SaucyAtTheGate Dumb as a stump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Amy_Siskind @Teatakin14team1 Knowing how well trump treats the military he's probably renting the hotel rooms for the soldiers he's renting to Saudi Arabia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BeSpleen @MollyJongFast And don't forget he has an ugly wife.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast Ted, are you another republican who has not read the constitution? Mayb you read it but didn't understand it. That's why you couldn't comment? Right?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@13AgentofChaos I agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@co_rapunzel4 @Pat98021395 What about allegations of sexual molestations of children?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@waconia3 @ScottImmordino I think. It depends on whether he is off or on his meds. He definitely has a split personality.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottImmordino I think the farmers got the point when the corporate subsidies were $500,000 and the small farmers were lucky if they got $5,000.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shaken0Stirred @Timmykhill101 Veterans, it's time to speak up and let trump know this is not acceptable.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PalmerReport @uvotguy How's the bus ride Rudy? Shouldn't you be taking Barr with you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ForOurFutureWI Wisconsinites, think of Pence as the Halloween version of Scott Walker. Vote Blue!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christoq Somebody stop this human trafficking. Isn't it time for The Hague to get involved???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottLCostello @DebraMessing @MSNBC Nancy, it's up to you to reign in the Supreme Court jurisdiction. They have to start respecting the decisions of the lower courts not favor the GOP.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nypapajoe Thank you for marching.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrsRabbitResist @Sharond63270168 Nancy, everybody has agreed that there is no law that says a sitting president can't be indicted. Indict or use the 25th. There is enough reasons for both.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RichardEngel @eyeofthegoddess Richard Engel I hope you can explain to the American people what you are witnessing first hand. Pompeo,Pence and trump have betrayed our allies at the behest of Putin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HopeSprings10 @MSNBC_rocks_ Trey Gowdy should be held accountable. He will probably get a job with trump's campaign. Definitely qualified.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ScottImmordino He's been in over his head since Putin elected him. I don't think he can deal with poisons and bonesaws!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@djrothkopf @DaisyTom5 I think he is the only president who has no clue what is in the constitution. How about books on tape?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpacialK3 I would think that would be up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MKSingstheBlues How can America allow a. Senate Majority Leader to assure hacking or foreign interference in our elections. Every Governor of every state (including Repubs) must find a way to secure their own elections.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jilevin Is that why he thinks it's okay to unleash them again?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertW31430731 @mgunnar45 I guess he doesn't keep up with current events.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WSJ @WSJopinion Another gift trump will give Putin. Another reason for impeachment and removal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@StephenBright Still waiting for the first accountability. It's the law. Arrest him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jersey_Craig He's just talking his Lindsey two face. There is enough evidence to impeach trump and others at least 10 times.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mulatta101 That sums it up perfectly!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rmayemsinger The fact is you can indict a sitting president and removing him from office and impeaching Barr should be the goal.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@essenviews @MSNBC_rocks_ Marines, please don't do this. trump has taken so much away from the military and only uses them for photo ops. He is not fit to lick the boots of any real marine.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Martamendoza718 Where do we find these uneducated educators?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Emolclause @kechjo @senatemajldr The money has to be given to the individual states to have enough workers to oversee the polls and to install a paper ballot system. A system that cannot be misread! Giving $250 million dollars to McConnell,MnNuchin,  a mistake. We have no FEC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScrewHataProof He is sewage. It takes a lot of gullibles to make him yacht rich.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tribelaw @donjefferis214 Laurence Tribe, if Barr threatens the IG that if he goes to Congress with the whistleblower info he will prosecute him shouldn't Barr be impeached, or prosecuted and removed from office?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@candies2639 @catmartini53 That's ridiculous. Nixon was investigated. Clinton was investigated. What makes trump think that he's so special that he can't be investigated?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jrh0 @SpacialK3 If McConnell is doing it we know he has found a new way to cheat. Tell your senators no bar code paper ballots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lrozen @erniefay It certainly sounds inappropriate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kurtfollower If the whistleblower can go directly to congress why is he letting trump and Barr stop him? Is he afraid of retribution from trump and Barr?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepJerryNadler @RepDougCollins @senatemajldr We need phsychiatric background checks to keep people like Doug Collins out of govt. He is a total wacko!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nicoxw1 Of course!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@christoq Moscow Mitch has not passed any election security bills. What is he going to do with the $250 million?? Nancy,it should go to all the states to make paper ballots secure. Give it to Stacey Abrams who is working for fair elections.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Waterdancer99 @SpacialK3 He is probably using tax payer money, or wall money, or military money, or money stolen from the empty homestead facility or money from all the unfilled govt. positions that was included in the budget. Where is the money???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CJ_isnowblue @SpacialK3 He's probably suing over his taxes because he needs another bull focal point. If he wants to distract from the whistleblower he could always bring up the separated families,children in cages,molestation of young children.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realJasonMix @donjefferis214 Who is the recipient of all these ill gotten riches. Inquiring minds want to know. Why are children and families sleeping on cement floors? All this money should be providing luxurious comfort not tin foil blankets and cold burritos.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MillenPolitics @Dntblkyorblssng He also should be talking about the children separated from their families living in deplorable conditions and the trump/Epstein scandal about molesting children and the missing 12 year old Marie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@hullboydan There was no reason to cut interest rates. The GOP wants another tax cut for the 1%.The national debt is out of control. Do all the wealthy want to stuff their mattresses before the depression comes?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VickyPJWard @vox @annanorthtweets Was Dershowitz tied to a bed and forced to have sex?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VickyPJWard @vox @annanorthtweets Complicit and victim do not mean the same thing Dershowitz .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wvjoe911 @MSNBC_rocks_ @politicususa Well that's not much of a threat. Except for the tax scams for the 1% they haven't passed anything for the people since Obama's first term.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr Junior,quit pandering. You already have a girl friend.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Strandjunker Keep asking!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MSNBC_rocks_ @EricTrump Eric you wouldn't understand that intelligence has its rewards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ForOurFutureWI GOP senators who are retiring do something for your country before you go. Speak out, tell the American people,especially the trump supporters how their democracy is being stolen. They are losing morally and financially.Only large donors benefit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottySpecks @NorthBelle4 Moscow Mitch and let's not fund first Responders Paul should both  be replaced. Vote Blue!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jim1036 @onerahinz Every time you think he can't say something more stupid he does. Did he really say this?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AidenWolfe Love your writing.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ShelbyKStewart It's hard to believe anybody would pay Santorum for his assinine opinions. Do you think he is on the trump payroll?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TimOBrien Moscow Mitch you need to resign. You are not working for the people you are working for yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No more tax cuts for the rich. Keep this up and we'll be paying them just because their rich. This is crap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amybwang @sandi_childs Don't do that Pete. Separation of church and state!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is really starting to sound like a Dan Brown novel. trump is afraid of oversight and rightfully so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoywheatJw Except for making promises he didn't keep he has done nothing but lie to the military. No raises. No improved housing. Using their money for the wall he will never build. Telling the military who can serve. NOTHING!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ResistXIIXVXIX @SenSchumer @Lee_in_Iowa @realDonaldTrump @NeverAgainActn All Americans should join in the Never Again movement. We need our country to be free of persecution and fear.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer @PamelaStovall6 @realDonaldTrump Can't Congress place congressional police at the borders to make sure the Judges orders are carried out? Will there be no penalties for disobeying Judges orders? We need congressional oversight at the borders.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RachelK1979 I've never heard of this kind of crap. It sounds like Hitler's Germany.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mschlapp Schlapp you really are a bad joke. What an ignorant remark.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottImmordino @GOPLeader The future of our country is at stake that's why we all need to Vote Blue. We want our Democracy Back! McCarthy you are as trumpy as it gets.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Strandjunker @onerahinz Where they wouldn't let a 12 year old child who has been molested disappear. What happened to Marie?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ewarren Senator Warren, during the post debate interview with Chris Mathews why didn't you answer his question directly. The one thing we voters hate is evasiveness. Just a tip from a fan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neeratanden @sandi_childs The middle class farmers are getting totally screwed. Only the wealthy farmers get substantial subsidies. The GOP is also asking for an emergency tax cut for the 1%. What the heck is their emergency? Did they run out of caviar and champagne?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danpfeiffer @sandi_childs Moscow Mitch Americans want honest elections. Why is this a problem for you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump This is a joke. I don't think there is a N.Y. Judge who would dismiss this lawsuit. I am sure that AG Vance must be in some kind of trouble for dropping the charges against junior and Ivanka. This is America. We still have laws.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepMcGovern @TrueFactsStated Moscow Mitch shame on you. You take money from Russia. You won't pass bills to secure our elections. You are not doing your job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maziehirono Thank you Mazie.I wish there were more like you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CraigRozniecki What's his take on men accused of rape who are guilty?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bridget_joy_ There are religious people and people who only think there religious. If you don't adhere to the golden rule and believe in total equality for all you are not religious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@luckyjade1212 @sandi_childs I try to guess which one of you were bribed and which ones were blackmailed or could there possibly some really creepy GOP that don't believe in equality and democracy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DominoPrinciple @sandi_childs @gtconway3d Marco,don't you have a paying job or do you just take tips?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbradsby As long as the migrant families and missing children and the trump/Epstein scandal are not forgotten I'm OK with ignoring trump!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DebraMessing You mean taking million dollar payoffs from Russian Oligarchs is just everyday stuff? Sounds like evidence to me. How about not wanting to secure future elections? Doesn't that sound like evidence to you Stedman?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RudyGiuliani @realDonaldTrump Rudy,don't you mean the spouse of Moscow Mitch!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricHolder Every Governor should insist on hand marked paper ballots or the GOP candidates should not be allowed to appear on the ballots. If Moscow Mitch won't protect our nation we will have to find other ways to make sure our elections are honest.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenWolfe Some of them would do America a big favor by running for the senate,congress or governor. You are right.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andylassner @AlanDersh The children that trump and Epstein are accused of raping are 12 and 13 years old. Some of the children were 14 or 15. If Dershowitz is going to try to put these children in a statutory rape situation for these heinous crimes it can only be for his own benefit!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NightlyPolitics It really suits him. I thought the GOP was into nicknames.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OfficialWHPress @AmbJohnBolton @realDonaldTrump @NobelPrize The Whitehouse House must have a standup comic. Too funny!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tipsy_in_Texas @kurtfollower Wouldn't it be up to Congress not to allow an Emergency tax cut for the rich? If there is an executive order why can't congress ignore it the way the GOP ignores subpoenas? The rule of law is obviously not working! PS.Cruz can't demand.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GavinNewsom @MSNBC_rocks_ It's not congress who is not passing common sense gun laws. Tell Moscow Mitch to do his job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReaperKat @FlowerFreak3 I must be getting old. This is a joke, right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ReaperKat @FlowerFreak3 Lyons you are an idiot. Bush was President at the time. I'd like to see the TV footage of trump running toward danger. Doesn't anybody in the GOP fact check?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stonecold2050 Moscow Mitch Mctreason still has the edge as the worst but Rand is a close second.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DearAuntCrabby @kurtfollower Actually he first wanted the law to apply to a 15 year old. Somebody must have convinced him to up it a year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NightlyPolitics My gosh, I thought she was busy with her gay conversion programs?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@andylassner Creepy Dershowitz  https://t.co/kMTRclmePm want to change the law so that you can call it prostitution instead of child molestation? Isn't that from the Epstein playbook?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maladamus @Stonekettle Good answer!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NightlyPolitics Nothing he does will deflect from the trump/Epstein scandal under investigation. If trump wants to investigate something it should be whatever happened to 12 year old Marie who went missing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PamelaStovall6 @realDonaldTrump What happened to Marie the 12 year old that disappeared. We must keep asking. She was somebody's child.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BARogers9 @MarkWarner I think Putin's game plan is being perfectly carried out by trump while Putin buddies up to N.Korea and China making Donny feel left out. Is this why trump is looking to play patty cake with the dictator from Hunger?I meant Hungary!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OMGno2trump Nobody is going to shun those who are Christians, Most Christians are kind, generous caring humans not people like Pence who does not believe in equality and wants everyone to be like him. Heaven forbid!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maydaymindy9 I think even some of his solid base will realize that he is screwing all middle class and poor. I know many independents who will not vote for him a second time. They didn't imagine how evil and uneducated he was.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 @TheStagmania Betsy DeVos is the definition of pure evil that's why she fit trump's definition of the best people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@danzu72 A totally bigoted person like Pence should never be asked to speak at a graduation. Young people today accept each other for who they are. The college students I have met in 2019 give me hope for a wonderful future and equality for all in America!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepAdamSchiff He needs more information about how to become a total dictator. He was left out of the Putin N.Korea meeting so he is feeling slighted. Maybe he can get love letters from a new friend.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CREWcrew @SaucyAtTheGate Does Vance fall under Letitia's durisdiction? She looks like a woman who could take no nonsense!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EricHolder @onerahinz I agree. We also have to find a way to secure every vote properly in every state. I'm sure there won't be any help from the GOP.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nprpolitics @rebeccastrong16 This is a crime against the American people. Shouldn't Barr be arrested or removed IMMEDIATELY????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rebeccastrong16 I don't like it. Why would anyone want to buy unhappiness. You can usually find it for free!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@emmy5s @funder @LindseyGrahamSC Poor thing. He forgot Country before trump .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@donnahofberg She really is a super smart woman. I really enjoyed her interview with Rachel Maddow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DogginTrump @MaryjaneMjmalin I thought Cruz was going to run over and kiss Barr's ass! He really was groveling. I guess he wants to stay in good with the boss.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CraigRozniecki Great analogy!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenWolfe @MaryjaneMjmalin He's like a bad accident. You want to look away bu you just can't .<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@omz__music How could you or get Paul Ryan and Susan Collins?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Yamiche @glynis_ciccone Hold him in contempt and arrest him. He is not above the law. We still do have some laws don't we. I'm sure Barr told enough lies to warrant impeachment or at least dismissal .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iankoski @sandi_childs Susan Collins should be disappointed she is always disappointing !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdKrassen @SoSueMe55 Cruz was the most disgusting at today's hearings. He spent his time sucking up to Barr like a tick on a dog. Graham just acted like the fool he is and pretty much admitted he knows nothing and read nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BettyBowers You're are great. You make me laugh out loud! Thanks<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NightlyPolitics The House will definitely call Mueller to testify. Barr says he has no problem with that. What the heck is your problem?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@kylegriffin1 @FlowerFreak3 Is it just me or is this a bunch of crap????<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rebeccastrong16 Funny and probably.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FlowerFreak3 Senator Hirono, I think you gave America a good look at Barr. Tomorrow wouldn't be too soon for Mueller to testify. Barr said he had no problem with Mueller testifying. LETS DO IT!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rebeccastrong16 I was also impressed with Harris. She could be OK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mila_bowen @maydaymindy9 I'm sure Mueller will straighten Barr out when he testifies.Barr is the one who acts like a Diva. He thinks he is above the law.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@onerahinz Last I heard it was 38%. Are you sure it's 46? Hard to believe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maydaymindy9 I like Hirono. That woman is tough.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@funder @onerahinz @TheDemCoalition It's time for all decent republicans to climb out of the swamp and start rebuilding their party. Impeach trump!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Isn't it time for decent Republicans to rise out of the swamp and start to rebuild their party by calling for the impeachment of trump?  https://t.co/iI4b5gODsP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RawStory Elijah Cummings, shouldn't trump's lawyers be charged with obstruction of justice? Complying with a Congressional subpoena is a rule of law. We cannot allow trump and his lawyers to break the law!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>More obstruction!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>America,Speaker Pelosi, we can't let this happen again!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mare4219 @LisaM3732 @rebeccastrong16 @RepAdamSchiff @RepJerryNadler @RepCummings @SpeakerPelosi It sounds like obstruction to me.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RVAwonk More OBSTRUCTION!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@funder @rebeccastrong16 The Republicans ignoring Russian interference makes them complicit in a criminal offense against their country<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RVAwonk @onerahinz More obstruction!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpyTalker @rebeccastrong16 I hope Carl Kline has the guts to do what's right. Everybody knows that Security Clearance tried to do their job but ther decisions were overturned by trump.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TeamPelosi I'm sure McConnell doesn't regret anything he's done including  accepting huge sums of money from Russian oligarch and rushing  through the appointments of judges without proper vetting and refusing to bring any Democratic bills to the floor etc. etc.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NancySinatra McConnell and company are not taking time to vet incoming judges as long as they are republican!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maydaymindy9 At least it's not a silent movie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HillBeverlyhill I'm sure the GOP doesn't know anything about them except that they are republican. McConnell is in such a hurry he is nit taking time for the vetting process.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Never270 @rebeccastrong16 Isn't Mnuchin involved in a multimillion dollar scam with the CEO of Sears? If this is true he should be removed from his job with the IRS. If not he should be removed for not turning over trump's taxes to congress.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Akki_J2 WHY???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I like your plan. We'll probably have to fumigate first. It's too big a job for febreeze!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sianoresist @rebeccastrong16 @SpeakerPelosi @RepJerryNadler I don't think it necessary to hold town halls. I think it's their duty to impeach.

<|startoftext|>@maydaymindy9 It actually nauseates me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenWolfe I agree with you about Elizabeth Warren. One of the brightest of all the candidates. She has guts as well.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@costareports Well Mitt, when are you going to start impeachment proceedings in the senate? Collins should go along with you. She thought the Mueller report was (tsk tsk) unflattering to trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@44mmvvpp Eric Holder,I wish you were in a position to prosecute trump,Barr, McConnell and the Senate GOP. Don't forget Pence and Sarah Sanders. You're the man who could win.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@maydaymindy9 I will never understand how republicans can throw away law and order and democracy.  Surely New York State has enough evidence of fraud to indict the trumps. Which AG dropped the felony fraud charges against Junior and Ivanka and why?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@psychdr100 I hate long chase scenes. They're boring!<|endoftext|>

I don't think our Democracy will survive two more years of trump.He is following the recipe for dictatorship  written by Hitler and Putin. We need help now!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MelissaRyan @onerahinz @GOP This isa real shit show!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arappeport @sandi_childs Isn't it a federal offense for the IRS not to release trump's taxes to Congress?Speaker Pelozi  speak up!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GovEvers The people elected Governor  Evers to work for them and that is what he is doing. Bravo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@looongleggs @funder I'm so sorry you and your family are subjected to this kind of disrespect from a nephews actions.After reading your article and knowing his heritage you would think he would be a proud American and want the same for others.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EricHolder @donnahofberg Eric Holder, now that you're in this conversation maybe we will see some results. While you're at it could you get the Mueller report released to congress as well? I'm not joking. If anybody can accomplish this its you!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@psychdr100 @Suzyqfit4u Why would trump accuse the Flake of being an enemy. He never ever disagreed with trump while he was in the senate.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@maydaymindy9 Everything in it would be fiction starting with how he was born to a German father. Hell no.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maydaymindy9 The media acts like it is afraid of trump. Why don't they spend more time talking about why the felony fraud charges were dropped against Junior and Ivanka? Why don't they do more investigating into the security breaches at mar a la go?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JuddLegum Isn't trump in the process of appointing a new head of IRS before his forever audit is finished? Barr is just part of a stacked deck.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@itsJeffTiedrich @onerahinz You forgot to mention the rotten to the core head of education.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NancySinatra If trump did get rolled by the Russians and the Saudis he is unfit to be president. I think he openly colluded with Russia when he said he took Putin's word that they did not tamper with US election.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoyceWhiteVance @onerahinz The Congress is elected by the people for the people. They have every right to the Mueller report in its entirety.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AshaRangappa_ @onerahinz trump said himself he would be happy to release the full report. What made him change his mind? Does the report show that he is the "disgrace"?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Rosekey19 @crooksandliars You have made millions of untaxed dollars by selling bullshit to vulnerable people. Do you really think that Social Security is growing the national debt and not the tax scam for the rich?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NancySinatra @RWPUSA @HouseGOP Nancy,are there any of the GOP in the house who have not been brainwashed or intimidated? I wish they would speak up!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HaroldItz @sandi_childs @MonicaLewinsky How can you feel sorry for Monica? She saved a dirty dress and sent it to her mother for safe keeping. Did she think she could someday sell it on E-Bay?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BetteMidler You are so right. That is real leadership with integrity,respect and true empathy for the people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewWisGov @GovEvers Support Governor Evers!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@maydaymindy9 The Democrats should really work on winning the Senate as well as the Presidency.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@maydaymindy9 @LeilaLstorvad That is a great visual.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@politvidchannel I strongly disagree. Democrats should not associate with the people that Fox employs. Democrats want to maintain their integrity and civility. This will not happen on a bad comedy show such as Fox!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RonWyden @sandi_childs Make sure that no votes are cast on voting machines from China thatIvanka has trademarks for. We must insist on paper ballots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeamPelosi @Lisa24681012 Speaker Pelosi,how has this scum gotten away with this tax scam and how can we stop them from doing more damage? They are trying to dismantle every decent program we have, nationally and internationally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BarbraStreisand With these kind of threats looming it's hard to wait for he next election. Is there no way to declare his presidency invalid and replace him and Pence with the real winners of 2016?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ddale8 Speaker Pelosi, shouldn't the American people consider this a threat and can't Congress do something to put a restraining order   on those who threaten others???<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump Quit calling yourself Speaker. You didn't qualify for the title when you were Speaker.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SocialPowerOne1 @LeilaLstorvad Pat Robertson, don't you understand that social security is th American people's money.

<|startoftext|>@alikat747 @RebeccaStefoff @JuddLegum Putin followed the same plan in Russia. It's a dictators playbook. We must not let this happen in America!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JuddLegum @rebeccastrong16 Does this sound like a threat to the American people by the president? It's hard to believe that even a republican would not be offended by this kind of crap.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahBCalif @rebeccastrong16 I think Monica retired!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AidenWolfe Eric Holder and Barak Obama were working on doing away with gerrymandering. I'm not sure how they are doing. I do know that Eric Holder gets things done!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thomaskaine5 Hell no!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realAliTweets @rebeccastrong16 They increased the national debt,they increased the trade deficit,they committed human rights violations by losing track of children and keeping some in wire enclosures,they agreed with dictators rather than American Intelligence!

<|startoftext|>@danpfeiffer @sandi_childs He left office with a 15% approval rating. Engineered the biggest tax scam for the 1%. The worst speaker of the house America has ever had. Accepted huge money from Adelson. Was it a bribe or a payoff?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amyklobuchar @rebeccastrong16 Cut DeVos!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@beverly_devoll @KottiPillar @mom4boca @TeamPelosi Cutting Medicare and social security would be embezzlement!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JeffFlake @TuftsUniversity @TischCollege Why would anyone care what he has to say?As a senator he was a total drama queen  who always put on a maybe show and then toed the GOP line.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thehill Are you some kind of a nut Liz Cheney?  trump did not defeat the Democrats, the Russians did. Be specific when you say he's improving the nation. The 1%  and the Spa Entrepeneurs? The children in wire cages with tin foil blankets?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MSNBC @MaddowBlog The pay is good,the lies come easy,plenty of executive time, a perfect job where you don't have to worry about facts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lisa24681012 How many more farmers have to go bankrupt because of bad trade deals?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ewarren Despite huge profits companies like Amazon and Google will probably be paying 0 taxes!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@synathroesmus @NewWisGov Wisconsin doesn't need another Scott Walker,the worst disaster that ever hit Wisconsin!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BetteMidler He is more likely to get a piece prize!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aaronbadgerWI @NewWisGov Scott Walker was the worst Governor Wisconsin ever had.After being voted out he still tried to take away power from the new Governor.He hobbled unions and ruined farming.Wisconsin:Don't let Walker run for any judicial positions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@aaronbadgerWI @NewWisGov Dairy farmers,soy bean farmers,corn farmrers, and wheat farmers are all being hung out to dry! Hopefully with a new administration we will be able to repair some of the damage. Wisconsin has always been the Dairy Center of America.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@stevesalaita I read your whole essay. I think your writing is exceptional. Your story could be the premise of a full length book. Truth combined with fiction could take many paths."An Honest Living", I would buy it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @LeilaLstorvad I don't know who was funnier,Baldwin or trump in the rose garden! That sing songy  voice made me lmao in both skits!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ADIC33 Add 100lbs to that and I think you'll be close!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdKrassen @uvotguy It blows my mind that trump could take advice from the Fox Fools and disavow advice from the govt. intelligence committees. Say it isn't so!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joncoopertweets Well Lindsey, I can't say that you sold yourself cheap. That's a nice piece of change. WAS IT WORTH IT???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RanttMedia @sandi_childs @realDonaldTrump To declare an emergency when there is none is like dialing 911 for no reason. A hefty penalty should ensue!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorSinema Disagree with vote on Barr. So far so good on other legislation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SocialPowerOne1 @sandi_childs This is the first thing she has ever said that make sense.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr A pin does not make an American . Actions do!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenWolfe Great response!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenWolfe I think trump is more like the heathens hellbent on revenge than the Evangelical do gooders he surrounds himself with. Why would they align themselves with a perpetual adulterer etc.etc.?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr What is being done about the human trafficking of children?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NewWisGov @JudgeNeubauer Be smart Wisconsin. Don't vote for Scott Walker for any office. He is the one who tried to pass laws to take away power from the new Governor you elected. He stifled unions. He has never done anything to benefit the people of Wisconsin!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@laurenduca @onerahinz CNN,why are you doing this. It's never a slow news day if you really do world wide reporting. It's stuff like this tha makes people turn to MSNBC.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WilDonnelly How did that woman ever become a senator? I'm sure Kavanaugh  supporters are her only fans. People of Maine, show her the door.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Kokomothegreat @rebeccastrong16 He thinks he's in love!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheStagmania Is CNN hurting for news? It's a big world with a lot going  on why would you have to resort to the ass with money? He doesn't like to be called a billionaire!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SocialPowerOne1 @MaryjaneMjmalin Isn't it amazing how a woman can get pregnant all by herself? A man who thinks he has no responsibility about having sex decides to ban abortion. This picture is really off.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeamPelosi When is someone going to draft a tax bill for the middle class? Taxes this year are atrocious. Help!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheLoyalO @rebeccastrong16 Nielsen,did you ever spend time at the border to see for yourself what they were doing to the families? Did you not even try to find out where these missing children were taken? You're still employed start finding the children.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timtime2 @PeltFrelken @NightlyPolitics It's hard to believe that you can buy GOP senators as easily as buying groceries!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@siano2020 Believe it or Not!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BetteMidler Surprise,surprise,what a guy will do for a billion bucks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realT_RumpT_Rex @donnah57 You get an A. Really good one!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HowardA_Esq Democrats want what experts in Border Security say is needed. You wouldn't ask a plumber to bake a cake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenatorCollins @secnav76 @SenCarlLevin Collins,do you have an opinion on the Senate Intelligence hearings or do you think they have no intelligence? Trump seems to think they dont. Will you defend our intelligence committees?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DonaldJTrumpJr Did you know that GM is closing five plants? Many jobs will be lost. Where and what type of jobs are available? Do they pay a living wage?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DogginTrump Stay well RBG. We need you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kokomothegreat @rebeccastrong16 Tell her thanks for the laugh.  That's funny.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SRuhle It is every citizens right to run for president but I think all the potentials should narrow it way down to a reasonable number and help the few that really seem plausible. Less money would be spent and support wouldn't be diluted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkWarner @sandi_childs Govt. shutdowns are totally stupid  and only cause hardships. End shutdowns once and for all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeamPelosi Speaker Pelosi,wouldn't it make sense to allot a certain amount of money for border security and leave it to the experts at Homeland Security and proper engineers to decide how the monies are spent? Why won't trump agree to that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@amyklobuchar @MaryjaneMjmalin I just don't get this nomination. It sounds like somebody's idea of a bad joke.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BetteMidler That's a cheerer upper! Thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maydaymindy9 @SteveSchmidtSES Just for the record. Paul Ryan left office with a 12% approval rating.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maydaymindy9 @SteveSchmidtSES His choices for good guys are ludicrous. Paul Ryan,Sarah Palin and now Schultz who says he was always a Democrat but now he's not. Duh?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamalaHarris I don't think Colombus  would mind if his holiday was replaced by an Election Day holiday. McConnell wouldn't have to worry about an extra federal holiday. Right?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BetteMidler No political experience. Start by running for a lesser position. How about mine inspector,they usually run unopposed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maydaymindy9 What would you expect from a guy who found Sarah Palin?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@petridishes And stay there!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@K_JeanPierre Why interview a rubber stamp?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RonMcBride3 Is this like a go fund me thing? Sounds like a great scam.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@justinamash @sandi_childs @POTUS Lindsey,you cannot declare an emergency where there is none.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@backt0nature I'm waiting.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid @rebeccastrong16 100%<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeamPelosi Speaker Pelosi, don't let Schumer do too much talking, he does not have your finesse.   He comes off as antagonistic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@funder @Allison21837532 You have just given us the State of the Union Address!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeTakei If you really love this country now is not the time to decide you want to run for president as an independent. Have the compromised republicans gotten to you?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maydaymindy9 He must have had lunch with Rubio!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maydaymindy9 I don't get it. I think some do. His approval ratings are constantly dropping.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HoarseWisperer The date for the SOTU address should be decided between Speaker Pelosi and trump. I don't think the issue should be decided by a retweet of your opinion!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HowardSchultz Please do not run for president. All you will do is help the GOP. I'm beginning to think that someone must have induced you to become a spoiler. Why else would you run as an independent???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollyJongFast No just say nooooo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maydaymindy9 Definitely not. I would like to see him get behind whomever the Democratic Party chooses in the primary!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nuorleansldy @mikememoli McConnell will likely do what he is told. No surprise there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@peterdaou @Natalie56883500 Cruz,you're making yourself more foolish than is necessary. Reread before you tweet or better yet just don't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maydaymindy9 Only until he puts on the magic velvet slippers. Voila!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lindachilders1 Perfect vehicle!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@treasonstickers @rebeccastrong16 Don't forget McConnell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@neal_katyal @rebeccastrong16 Sarah, you are getting paid to do nothing, so go do nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer @sandi_childs @realDonaldTrump Commerce-the buying and selling of necessities for money<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenWolfe I for one look forward to your astute opinions and the colorful way you express yourself. Sometimes a little too colorful but that's O.K<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WSJ Sappy hour!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Lindsey what are you smoking?  trumps approval rating toda was 34%. Not exactly a vote of confidence from the American people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JohnLeguizamo @onerahinz Great tweet. You have just improved the reputations of six presidents!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B52Malmet @LeilaLstorvad Just do your busy work Lindsey. Everyone wants you out of their hair!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stonecold2050 @donnah57 That is definitely the best caption for those two. Thanks for the laugh!a,<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaelschweitz @rebeccastrong16 I love the crack about the ramps. She is so evil she probably did!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coleyworld It could be the start of a new sit-com,"Fox and Friends"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaelschweitz @LeilaLstorvad The state of the Union is a mess. Why would we want to listen to lies about how great we are doing? I'll pass on the retweet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sandi_childs Everybody knows that Cruz doesn't think, he just parrots.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AynRandPaulRyan @sandi_childs IfAmerican banks won't loan money to a millionaire like trump how is your average middle class American going to get a bank loan?If 800k people is a small number why doesn't Wilbur offer them no interest loans??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@siano2020 @LeilaLstorvad If they can, I hope they do. Sounds like a great idea!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump If the wall was so important why was it not funded in your first two years? Why don't you ever answer this question? Inquiring minds want to know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer @rebeccastrong16 @realDonaldTrump Did somebody say you're the secretary of commerce? Doesn't that include the buying and selling of food,gas,healthcare? Can all of the unpaid workers in need come to you for a no interest loan? Put out the word,you'll have a line at your door!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NBostar @atrupar @tedcruz Thanks for the chuckle!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar @rebeccastrong16 @tedcruz Is trump playing a game with Cruz? It's called how many times can I insult him before he has a negative reaction?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sfpelosi @onerahinz Mcsally from Arizona are you voting to end the shutdown? Your constituents would like to know.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sfpelosi @onerahinz END the SHUTDOWN!!  NOW!! You are destroying people's lives!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OMGno2trump Where should people go for food when they don't have the money? Supermarkets like to get paid!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenWolfe Love your description of Speaker Pelosi. There are many of us that support her!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenWhitehouse @rebeccastrong16 @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi The state of the union is dire.Govt. shut down.Federal workers not getting paid.Deficit out of control.Families still  https://t.co/czYXP1t5Yf losing money. Democracy fading into dictatorship. Why would trump want to brag about the state of the Union??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nytpolitics Knowing how important the mid terms were to the Democrats how could you do  this? I just scratched you off my potential list of candidates for president. We don't need another representative who can be bought.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BryanDawsonUSA @onerahinz Why does anybody give her a platform to spew her hate?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coleyworld @rebeccastrong16 I just wish we could get started!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rebeccastrong16 Romney,why in the world did you want to be in the senate? I thought you were already ultra rich. You certainly don't add anything to the dialogue. You may as well just say "me too"<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@siano2020 @donnah57 I do like her and what she stands for but its too early in the game for me.  It will be a Democrat. That's for sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seungminkim @sandi_childs Why are so many senators afraid of trump.? He can't fire them,they were elected. They were elected to serve their constituents who want open govt. Negotiating can be done with an open govt. GOP senators what is your problem??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@coleyworld I guess they just don't care who knows what!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soldotnaguy @SenFeinstein You are totally hopeless and don't have a clue what is going on in our own govt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soldotnaguy @SenFeinstein Don't you get it? Trump wanted a govt. shutdown. It's not about the wall. All Americans want border security.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soldotnaguy @SenFeinstein Mexico will never give trump his campaign promise. I'm sure he never meant it when he yelled it at his rally.if the wall was so important he would have had it by now. Shutting down the govt. was the power f ignorance.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maydaymindy9 @AnnCoulter She doesn't care about politics. She likes influencing politicians.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Heidiaca Good luck Tru. Your fans are rooting for you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@B52Malmet @NancySinatra @LindseyGrahamSC Don't you think it's time to look into Andrew Jackson's past. For pete's sake become relevant!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@soldotnaguy @SenFeinstein Negotiations can always take place with an open govt. That is what civilized adults would do. There was no reason whatsoever to shut down the govt. and cause so many Americans major disruptions in their lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarkWarner @sandi_childs Impeach,indict,expel. Whatever it takes This is not both sides. It's trump and his toady McDonnell . Open the govt.  Only criminals take hostages.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maydaymindy9 They heard there is a 2 for 1 at McDonalds!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BetteMidler You must be dreaming! This could never happen in America.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BetteMidler Trump has also managed to find the worst possible people to appoint to key positions in our govt. They are the gang of garbage!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@funder Stop blackmailing America. OPEN the GOVT.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WCMonsters247 Windy City Monsters is growing on me! We NEED  a KICKER!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenWolfe Impeachment or indictment for trump,pence and McConnell. How do we the people accomplish this??? The stupidity of a govt. lockdown only proves to Americans and the world how dis functional our administration is!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bsick88 @SaysHummingbird Love the caption. Funny!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SaysHummingbird @rebeccastrong16 Don't compare sh-t to sugar!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nytpolitics Nielsen,if there was no policy in place what did you do just wing it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IsaacDovere @JayCee5755 Trump always brags about his big crowds. I'm surprised he hasn't tried to turn the people's hardship into a rally.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@funder @onerahinz The female version of flake. Just ignore!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdKrassen How can any truly religious person discriminate against another for any reason???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NancySinatra @SenatorLeahy @virago0523 @senatemajldr I generally don't designate hell to those I disagree with but these are extenuating circumstances. He should rot in hell.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stonecold2050 I would like him to say it was stupid to ,shut down the govt. Let's reopen the govt. and discuss border security like adults. That's not going to happen, is it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AidenWolfe Speak well at the kitchen table. Teach  your children to be colorblind and gender inclusive. Make sure you vet who you vote for. Intelligence and civility a must.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stonecold2050 Education. None!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@adamcbest @keithboykin Is Graham in Turkey to accept a huge donation for the Republican Party? Yes or no? True or false?  What's his game plan? Does he know the govt. is shut down? Does he have a security detail?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NancySinatra @realDonaldTrump Resign works for me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NancySinatra @DearAuntCrabby @VICE Hopefully he won't last years. Surely impeachment,and or indictments can't be far away.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fred_guttenberg @onerahinz I don't think he is protecting anybody but himself. Is it payment or blackmail? There must be a big payoff for somebody to do what he is doing to our country!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NancySinatra @funder We're people like Graham,McConnell,Collins,Romneyetc.etc.ever traditional Republicans? When did we lose the two party system? I remember when both parties were for one Country!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jimsciutto @VP What is this person smoking?Human beings died today. Where did he get his information that Isis has been defeated? We need Global Allies to help us know what is going on in the real world. Our uninformed leaders cannot protect America!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nadinevdVelde @onerahinz @atrupar Romney is so reminiscent of flake. Drama  and fold. They are too predictable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maydaymindy9 Save yourself a room with a view.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WisDems @NewWisGov @GovEvers Stand tough Governor Evers. Wisconsinites helped you beat Walker because they know you want what is best for the people and the country.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@psychdr100 I think he likes the fact that he looks like he is doing something when he is actually not. Being ineffectual is not power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdKrassen How did this nightmare ever become trumps dream?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piratemanwalt @janunit @scottdweck @AOC @realDonaldTrump Flake voted with trump all the time. He liked to put on a "well,maybe show"just for effect but he always voted with trump.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AOC @onerahinz AOC now that you have the Republican votes I'm sure congress and the senate will find a way.  Congressional lawyers must know  how to render McConnell non essential to bring a vote to the floor.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SandraMargolese Rosalind Russell and Cary Grant-Front Page. It's a classic!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maziehirono @rebeccastrong16 @realDonaldTrump The more I learn about Barr the more I realize he would not be an unbiased AG. Vote no!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rebeccastrong16 Be honest. You don't judge them for their religious preferences they should not judge you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrumpyMcDiarmid @timmyturmoil This is the same reaction they had in 1939. You see it but you don't believe it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timmyturmoil I think Americans are exhibiting a major amount of patience and civility while we are waiting for the Mueller probe to wrap up.If the govt. is not fully open soon and if the legislature is not allowed to do their jobs I think you will get your riots.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RepMarkMeadows Don't talk like an ass. The house and the senate offered a deal which included funds for Border Security. Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter told trump not to sign it. I'm sure even Limbaugh and Coulter laughed about their clout over trump!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AdamSchiff @rebeccastrong16 Why does he say things that are so easily disproved. His 10% raise for the troops,the tax break for the middle class,how his trade deals will help American economy etc.etc.etc.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CHIBears247 I'm sure he is a great kid and he must feel awful but he missed. A lot of field goals this season. The loss wasn't his alone. 52 penalty yards in the third didn't help.

<|startoftext|>@CHIBears247 Trubisky could still be suffering from injury. Too many int. Tariq Cohen was bright spot on offense. Defense was Stupendous. Great,Great Win.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maydaymindy9 @onerahinz I love your characters. That cast would make a great sitcom!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CHIBears247 Super Defense. So happy with win against the Rams I'm not even going to criticize (at least not until tomorrow) Great Game!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@politvidchannel Tony Evers I think that is the only way to reverse these abominable actions by the GOP. Be the backbone that fights for DEMOCRACY!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHIBears247 I hope Trubisky is not as antsy as I am. Time fora glass of wine. Good luck guys, we're all cheering for you!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maydaymindy9 @onerahinz I think Betsy DeVos would win first prize for the most destructive and take the silver for most corrupt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump It's time to take a course in economics 101 . Have you never heard of inflation?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHIBears247 @DaBearsBros How about BFF-Bear Fans Forever.  Win or lose there is never too much talk about the Chicago Bears.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sfpelosi @TeamPelosi @SFDemocrats @DavidCamposSF Like the slogan.Dont AgonizeOrganize. Good Work!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NancyPelosi A tax break for middle America instead of the one percent. I think we'll see it  with Nancy Pelosi.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdKrassen @Dazy2008 Paul Ryan and Scott Walker should take the first scheduled flight to Mars. Their political shenanigans do not belong in Washington or Wisconsin.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdKrassen @Dazy2008 The sooner the better! Like Now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ananavarro @onerahinz @BillHaslam Governor help this girl. Ana keep working for justice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Canucklehead601 @MrEnglishBear The ultimate Soldiers Field Bear's experience is freezing your ass off.  GO Bears!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@atrupar I would point out to Peter Navarro that farmers are going broke,the auto industry is closing plants,the deficit is ballooning out of control ,veterans are not being paid money owed them,Federal workers are not getting raises, there is talk.  Of chipping away at Social Security .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@InterestingSci1 Amazing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CBCPolitics What in the world is she talking about. Where do they find these actors. That's something Gracie Allen would say!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@benwikler @rebeccastrong16 Rats come out undercover of darkness. Can the new Governor reverse this bill by executive order. After all  this is no longer a Democracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@tribelaw @rebeccastrong16 @maddow @Lawrence @AriMelber Does this mean the banning of early voting in Wisconsin will not take effect?  I sure hope so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EdKrassen @rebeccastrong16 As it should be. It would not work with this senate because this senate  would be afraid  to go against McConnel  even if it were the law.  WHY???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GOVTWINE Great descriptive writing. I particularly  liked the bacon grease hair and the bupkes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@michaelschweitz He obviously likes his outfit. He's  smiling. Too cute!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@backt0nature Enjoy every day. Wishing you good health and happiness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sirDukeDevin @onerahinz @realDonaldTrump There are good people on both sides. Need I say more!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Shareblue @TeamPelosi BI hope the Democrats plan includes a way to reverse any damage done by the GOP in Wisconsin and Michigan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@benwikler @rebeccastrong16 @IronStache Scott Walker you have been voted out. Move on. Let the people's  choice do his job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHIBears247 Let's not get morbid. I actually thought they would lose in regulation time. Surprise,surprise. 10 more minutes of Bear Football. Get a deep dish pizza#<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If you can read this, you‚Äôve helped me reach 10 followers. Thank you!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@zeebap2 @onerahinz @JuddLegum I  am sure that the children are not wearing fancy clothes and dining on fillet. Ask Betsy DeVos  who profits the most from Bethaney  Christian services. That should give you a hint how this business works.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NancySinatra @truthout Republican Senators  it is up to you to stop the confirmation of Radical Judges. Last opportunity for Flake to do something grand beside Grandstanding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@srl @patrickdmarley @MollyBeck Don't Wisconsin Republicans realize that  some of them voted with Democrats to elect a new Governor. Why not work together instead of  sabotaging the incoming administration?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Optimus28782561 @CHIBears247 I'm  a big fan of optimism.!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenFeinstein Sen. Feinstein  can't  the  republican  senators  realize that it's time to think of their country  not  their discombobulated party!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHIBears247 The defense will beat Giants . Don't  freak, one game at a time#<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHIBears247 The defense will beat the  g<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHIBears247 I  am paranoid too.  I was comfortable when they played the   Lions  but the Rams  are a bigger challenge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chrisbrockman A   Bear fans totally prejudiced pick#    Go   Mack!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SandraMargolese @agathachristie That's exciting !    Keep writing<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHIBears247 Nagy devise plays  where  the   O line  gives   Trubisky  time  to work from the pocket.   You don't worry  when he runs to  often, the rest of us do.     This is not college!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanRather Nature is grand.  You have to take time to smell the roses!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHIBears247 A great day,a great game , love the dance.  Happy thanksgiving!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CHIBears247 I know they can do this  and. Hopefully more.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Gs_GoneFishing Tv funhouse,   The ambiguously gay duo!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHIBears247 Not always pretty, great defense, kicker has definitely  been practicing.  Bears  win!!  I'm   Happyüòä<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHIBears247 Ditto ,!!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GrnEyedMandy Don't  blame the media for  lewinsky  hauling herself out in public.  She is still looking for her 15minutes of fame.   Why else a tv show#<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IvankaTrump @kempfoundation Ivanka what are opportunity zones . Is it learning  to  flip burgers or free college tuition  to ensure  a  brighter  future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHIBears247 Trubisky. Has  big  time  potential . O line and defense  are doing their jobs.  Need kicker  badly#<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TwTPgh @LindseyGrahamSC Are there two   Graham's with opposite opinions or just one very confused  man#<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CHIBears247 I missed the game so I can't  backseat coach. I'm glad Mitch found the pocket. Thanks for update#<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matthaig1 Matt  you once tweeted  how comparisons steal someone's joy. I  would  like to reread it. How about a retweet. I generally agree with most of your observations. Keep defending the planet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ajplus How can the election officials have no authority to fix the problem. If it's not their job who's job is it#<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHIBears247 Team needs work,special teams,defense,offensive line and play calling. What else is there#<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHIBears247 No pass defense, lousy tackling.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHIBears247 Trubisky has. Potential . The offensive line does not allow him to stay in the pocket and show what he can do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHIBears247 The Bears can do this. Trubisky  can do this . If the defense hangs tough it's a win##<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kwallace23 The Cubs had an outstanding season. Why fire anybody. That's baseball#<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer @ClistonBrown I don't understand how anyone could fall for this bull.  Do t drink the koolaid#<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheStagmania Who saves a dirty dress and sends it to her mother. I think bill  was the dupe  in this relationship#<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHIBears247 Trubisky stats were definitely an a!  Over  300 yds. 3td and 1 int. Today the defense was offensive#<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHIBears247 The half that trubisky coached  was  great.  I just have to get  over the over time !üò©<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nytpolitics When Cruz.  Was running for president   At one of his rallies he was introduced by  a low life who was calling New Yorkers   Jew Yorkers.  Why would  you vote for a man who aligns himself  with  anti Semitic  racists .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHIBears247 Only kidding. I think the  Bears  will definitely take the do.phins and the bills. The Patriots will be a challenge  but it could happen#. Don't  sell the jets short  they show definite signs of having a team#<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nytpolitics @hillhulse Did McConnell buy off Collins with a free lunch,  Collins  I am in your age group, if I did. What you did my children and grandchildren would disown me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheStagmania Flake  republicans and democrats and independents are counting  on you to do what's right,    Vote no .<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHIBears247 I really have to see one more game at least before making a prediction, but I am hoping üòä<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robpegoraro Graham you should be ashamed, if John  were alive I think he would smack you, hopefully joe Biden  has the guts to do it for him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CHIBears247 Welcome to the big leagues, great  play calling, great protection and receiving Great work trubisky  A little more concentration and a less running,  you could be great ,<|endoftext|>
