<|startoftext|>@Tara61711 Let the tories' actions do it for you..day by day..hour by hour.. sooner or later folks wake up to their incompetence and wilful negligence thru real life experiences<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@annewitha_e @AndrewBowie_MP Absolutely...the buck for all of this stops with tories plain and simple...they let a genie out of a bottle and have proved themselves completely unable to deal with the consequences. Disastrously poor governance since 2010.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JacobFreeeman All we can do is watch the omnishambles play out and ensure those responsible never get close to the levers of power ever again. I feel sure we will all be in agreement on that very soon although it will hopefully be the catalyst for Scottish independence, Irish unity etc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JacobFreeeman Well the catalyst for all of this is utterly incompetent, wilfully negligent goverance..tories enabled all of this, creating the breeding ground thru cuts where regressive and scapegoating views can fester and then calling a vote  without any form of plan, vision or definition<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Only 29% of low earners said they believed the #Conservatives cared about them" ...absolutely stunning that so many folks think the #tories give a flying shite about them. They represent the polar opposite of caring #poverty #inequality #foodbanks    https://t.co/WjZFv0eZYy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Melfynjones1 George Orwell's 1984...and eating soil<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JacobFreeeman Shared experiences tend to focus the mind Jacob ie: empty supermarket shelves, issues with meds etc etc ...there was no vision attached to brexit..just a word...and it remains just a word to this day. No nation has ever decided to commit to this degree of self flagellation before<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JacobFreeeman There can be no centreground unfortunately when the tories successfully dig out a big feckin chasm between us all and continually make the divide ever greater. Only when experiences coalesce will there be any hope of a resolution of sorts.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArgyleLoz To be fair by the start of February there will be no one around who will actually admit to having voted for #brexit ...not even tory MPs I'd imagine<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You will end up behind bars #GeorgeEustice, together with the rest of your tragic #brexit cabale...not the kind of bars though where drinks are free or heavily subsidised #NoDeal #NoDealBrexit<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Ian47282468 @DavidJonesMP @DavidGHFrost My apologies Ian..I really should not rise to the bait..there's no point whatsoever in communicating across the chasm  ...until our experiences coalesce in the first few months of 2021..only then will we have common ground!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ian47282468 @DavidJonesMP @DavidGHFrost "The public" ??? An ever diminishing group of folks that will have dwindled down to nothing, zilch, zero by March or April of next year...you'll find precisely no one claiming to have voted for brexit once those supermarket shelves start to look increasingly empty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@freeworlder Ego mate...tackle that and you tackle a lot...self aggrandisement and self absorption are the root cause of a helluva lot of our shit ie materialism. A lot can be learnt from Buddhism and other eastern philosophies...we all need a sense of perspective!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Listening to the #andrewmarr interview, you soon realise #GeorgeEustice has not a single clue as to what shitshow is coming down the tracks with #nodeal #brexit..not the foggiest.

<|startoftext|>@TheStephenRalph So pitiful and childish, you almost feel sorry for the deluded "leaders" who display such pointless immaturity in their language..they all know they're talking utter tripe but have to say this drivel to appease their 'half' of the electorate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarolineLucas Absolutely...the language of exceptionalism employed by tories over the past 4 or 5 years is truly embarrassing, pathetic and puerile...it's the same as the #maga nonsense used by #trump ..we urgently need co-operation and collective action, not pitiful playground oneupmanship<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mike_Fabricant Just another tory MP with shit for brains. Their highly selective use of the truth &amp; continual inability to deal in facts have unfortunately hoodwinked &amp; brainwashed a large swathe of the UK electorate..but they're running out of road and they know it. Just keep doublin' down!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thedefenderuk Go for it...there's no delusions of grandeur or faux senses of entitlement or exceptionalism up here, just a real progressive, open-minded energy and a desire to engage intelligently with the future. Sadly you just don't find that down south these days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mikegalsworthy This is embarrassing...that so many tory MPs have not even the most basic grasp of geography...the most basic grasp of what is and what is not an independent nation..it's been this way since June 2016 as lie upon lie upon lie is devoured by a frankly stupid electorate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thewhalewatcher @NicolaSturgeon Speaking as someone who's just made the shift north..."Get it done"...Scotland has one hell of an exciting future ahead of it, unhindered by small and closed minds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thedefenderuk Absolutely...I was always going to end up here but the dye was cast June 24 2016...moved up a few months ago and it's like finally inhabiting a land of sanity, of common sense and of compassion...a million miles from the shit pile that England has become thanks to tory rule<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SueScarrott Yeah that's just typical tories...on an entirely unrelated matter has anyone heard or seen anthing of that wee pocket dynamo #MarkFrancois ...you'd have thought he'd be front and centre with his wet dream brexit so tantalisingly close.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrionaBolger @MattHancock It's the inevitable fall out from the 2008/9 crash...austerity follows..then scapegoating as services get cut...then populism...same every time ie the 1930s following the Great Depression..we never learn because our economic system channels our nature into survival of the fittest<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Douglas4Moray And the record of the tories across all of the UK is.....????!!! Hmmm...folks in glass houses really should not be chucking stones around.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrionaBolger @MattHancock Precisely....choose each and every possible scapegoat before realising it's totally self inflicted. Cognitive dissonance run amok.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TrionaBolger @MattHancock Good luck with that one...millions have been asking the same question for four and a half years...and not one response from anyone...anywhere...ever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Careyscape @DominicRaab @MarrShow @SophyRidgeSky Sadly James it's very difficult to double back when they've been doubling down on dumb for years...to do so would see them lose face and they can't have that, at least not until early 2021 when they know their game will be up. Their populist project still has depths to plumb.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>On any sane, intelligent planet a species interested in protecting and ensuring its own survival would view Peter Joseph's recent film #Interreflections and the ideas behind #RBE as apocryphal beacons of hope..sadly not on brainwashed, hypnotised and bewitched planet earth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alangaulton @johnredwood Waking up each morning to see the latest nonsensical musings from this throwback on my twitter timeline is like having a big pile of horseshit dumped at your front door.

<|startoftext|>@seatleon100 @bobbt2417 @tconnellyRTE @rtenews Without doubt a possible scenario....can you even imagine typing that line 'state of emergency' 5 to 10 years ago...astonishing quite how far the UK has tumbled over the past 4 years..and how far it still has to fall in the coming weeks and months<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SueScarrott @Douglas4Moray Too right...The amount of folks wanting rid of this tory muppet show will likely increase exponentially early in 2021...there will be nowhere to run..ten years of wilfully negligent governance will see karma come home and Scotland break free of the deadweight of conservatism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SueScarrott @Douglas4Moray No mention either by #RishiSunak yesterday...perhaps they think it'll go away if they don't mention it...well it won't..#brexit will very soon be the excessively flattulent elephant in the room that could well see off the tories for a generation.

<|startoftext|>If you can't draw the conclusion that we are living in a broken economic system from the way the cost of #PPE went up by 1000%+ at the start of #covid19 then nothing will persuade you.

<|startoftext|>@malscanlon @trevor_stables Yes...the same applies to Scotland getting out. Inevitable...not a chance bojo the clown will be able to keep the union together once the rammifications of the absurd nonsense that is brexit play out in real time...from the start of the month after next!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Faudaville And all at the same time as having a weak, woeful and witless opposition in Westminster...so no chance of there being any accountability over corruption.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>And still they will scream 'we've taken back control'......but only of hunger and impoverishment. The clusterfuck that is #brexit rumbles on with no sunny uplands or unicorns grazing the pastures in sight. A great, if worrying, article by @GeorgeMonbiot   https://t.co/vXfUfYkjhC<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScotNational Every word this tragic clown utters merely makes independence more inevitable. Every tory policy with regard to Scotland brings it closer. Clearly he's no lover of democracy ...except when it suits his needs and those of his wealthy puppetmasters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@John2Win Too right independence will finish devolution. That's the whole point...taking back control from a rotten, incompetent westminster tory party aided and abetted by the witless #Scottishtories. You are complicit in where we are right now.

<|startoftext|>@DalbidEU @johnredwood Blame everything on everyone but themselves...it's how the tories do things. They never ever understand or recognise the consequences of their actions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnredwood Life expectancy reduced in England over the ten years of tory rule. Life expectancy rises in Scotland over the same period...if you can't give folks more of this 'life' thing, what's the point of your party!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Lamentably laughable...The comments of Boris Johnson on #devolution in Scotland reveal a distinct dislike of democracy and the way voters should be ignored. Oh the irony!

<|startoftext|>@GeorgeMonbiot Maybe in the future let's have psychological profiling for those wanting to govern. Trump, patently unfit to govern, should have been weeded out of any presidential race at the very start. Power in the hands of narcissists must always be avoided.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeorgeMonbiot That there are 70 million, admittedly cognitively dissonant, folks in the US willing to vote for trump's dumagoguery is worrying...their views have had oxygen for 4 years and, without profound change, they will continue doubling down.

<|startoftext|>@Faudaville @AndrewRosindell They feel it's all slipping away so now is the time to accelerate the doubling down on dumb...shock tactics aimed at increasing the divide, the polarity...sadly some will buy it and continue their inexorable path down the toilet bowl.

<|startoftext|>@thevoicebloke The mere fact that many millions of Americans have learnt nothing, nowt, zero from the last four years of lunacy is very disturbing..and almost more disturbing than the existence of trump himself. Our species, it must be concluded, is a waste of space on the strength of this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanielBarrs2 @marykfoy @BorisJohnson The most logical, common sense course of action that should have been taken last spring...but the UK doesn't have a govt imbued with common sense. If it did, brexit wouldn't even be a word.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every single #MAGA voter should watch #Totallyundercontrol @undercontrolmov and now.

<|startoftext|>@cactus_woman @Angela68060318 No... principally because they understand maths and numbers.

<|startoftext|>@virgosam70 If this pandemic persists and this govt has one iota of common sense (fat chance!!) then #universalcredit should very soon morph into #UBI #UniversalBasicIncome ...coronavirus could speed up this trend globally but you need responsible and wise governance first and foremost<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>A thread (worth reading) that reveals, as if we didn't all know it, the utterly ludicrous and nonsensical nature of #brexit. There simply are no benefits whatsoever, only drawbacks.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@petercleobrown @TheoBiddle Aye...you can't fight gravity!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheoBiddle @petercleobrown I can understand your desire for the union to continue but sometimes change has to be embraced. Independence for Scotland followed by Irish unity and Wales breaking away will only help England find its soul and escape the darkness of myopia, exceptionalism and tory incompetence<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheoBiddle @petercleobrown Even if the tory muppet cabale go full on dictatorship it will only embolden #Scottishindependence and #brexit will only increase support. Change is good. It should be embraced. Scotland has all the natural resources, energy and passion to become a beacon in the world.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheoBiddle @petercleobrown That won't be required. When support consistently reaches over 60% to 65% there simply cannot be an argument against another referendum no matter what kind of shitshow tory govt is in power. It's inevitable.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@EdmundSarky @freeworlder Spot on.... just a case of howling at the moon, tribal tantrums perhaps but one of the only real time platforms we have to diseminate new visions of the world given the uselessness of mainstream media<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@freeworlder The ideas behind the Free World Charter, #RBE #TVP #TZM etc are as anti establishment as it could possuibly get but are increasingly becoming as pro common sense as it gets. Events are happening faster than we could ever have imagined. The time will soon come for these ideas.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@freeworlder 3/ Escaping the polarising and divisive left right paradigm is essential in terms of language and rhetoric. What needs to circumvent that paradigm is common sense...ideas that deal with existential issues and go down the rabbit hole to tackle real causes of our malaise ie money<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@freeworlder 2/ The right can never and will never see the bigger picture because of its focus on the individual however when the weight of necessity bears down ie #ClimateChange #inequality as is increasingly the case then it becomes essentially self immolating when co-operation is required<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@freeworlder 1/ It's difficult to escape the conclusion that any kind of #RBE or open access economy isn't "leftish thinking" due to the holistic and collective nature of the solution. The right focuses on the individual ie conservatism / libertarianism that represent an atomistic approaches<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Chunkyferryman @henriette88 @lorraine_teuten Spot on...but it's where the majority takes you in a referendum. IMO it was the most pitifully thought out referendum in history..no plan, no vision, no definition &amp; we still have none 4 years on thus there will always be major effects from such monumental negligence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chunkyferryman @henriette88 @lorraine_teuten  https://t.co/ozGZfTVgF5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chunkyferryman @henriette88 @lorraine_teuten And then along comes brexit eh ;-) ...anyone looking at that voting map on June 24 2016 would see two totally divergent nations going in opposite directions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chunkyferryman @henriette88 @lorraine_teuten Could not disagree more I'm afraid. When your rhetoric is small minded, racist and imbued with zero vision then it is very very different to what is being said by Nicola Sturgeon<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chunkyferryman @henriette88 @lorraine_teuten There's another side argument here that Scotland leaving the union could just well be a massive wake up call to voters in England to shift their direction of travel from exceptionalism to embracing radical change against a bankrupt establishment...but that's a long shot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chunkyferryman @henriette88 @lorraine_teuten This will always be an interesting debate and I understand your points...all well made from a different perspective to the normal 'stand still' unionist approach...but ultimately it's about recognising that Scotland has every right to self determiNATION however much it costs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chunkyferryman @henriette88 @lorraine_teuten Cause and effect. Yin and yang and totally different ideologically.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chunkyferryman @henriette88 @lorraine_teuten I cannot disagree with a word of that...but what chance that happening with tories in control? The trouble is it's swimming against the tide in England. Without brexit there's every chance indy would not be on the table  It has simply magnified the differences in outlook.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chunkyferryman @henriette88 @lorraine_teuten Sadly, the tories or some similar more extreme right wing incarnation will always win in England... and therein lies the problem..how long does Scotland suffer with that democractic deficit before it opts for a different route?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chunkyferryman @henriette88 @lorraine_teuten That comes nowhere near the levels of stupidity exhibited before and after the brexit vote I'm afraid...where would i begin on the chestnut!?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chunkyferryman @henriette88 @lorraine_teuten Absolutely not. No govt would ever promote a policy on the basis of it making the population poorer but we all see thru it as spin. I've spoken to so many who voted no in 2014 but are now yes precisely because Scotland is being taken out of the EU against its will.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chunkyferryman @henriette88 @lorraine_teuten So what is your answer?? More of the same? More division, bad feeling etc?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chunkyferryman @henriette88 @lorraine_teuten If the majority of the population prefer that scenario over and above the idea of being controlled by English tories then what is the problem?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chunkyferryman @henriette88 @lorraine_teuten Absolutely not. Incorrect on every level. The desire for independence is a reaction to the myopia and stupidity of brexit. It's about looking outwards and being progressive OR looking inwards and regressing. It's a wholly different kind of 'nationalism'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chunkyferryman @henriette88 @lorraine_teuten Everyone realises the sacrifices will have to be made and costs will rise, certain services may be cut BUT you can only put up with incompetent and negligent governance for so long. The idiocy and division wrought be brexit has bought all of this to the surface<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chunkyferryman @henriette88 @lorraine_teuten I understand that you prefer the security of union but when the dominant party in that union is on a completely different trajectory then surely the people should be free to decide on their own destiny? To do that is simply democracy in action.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chunkyferryman @henriette88 @lorraine_teuten With your reasoning there can never be new nations founded when in fact many have ....either by adopting the currency of another or formulating their own prior to independence. It is not an insurmountable issue by any stretch.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SarahKSilverman Some folks have such sad, joyless lives. Is it a poor education, peer pressure or just a complete lack of positive experiences? All of the above I suspect. Tragic as this is indicative of the world right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chunkyferryman @henriette88 @lorraine_teuten Possibly if I trusted them and they offered something in return. Totally hypothetical on an individual level. It's one of the options that is very much on the table.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chunkyferryman @henriette88 @lorraine_teuten We shall see. Time will tell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chunkyferryman @henriette88 @lorraine_teuten What is to be gained by the "UK" govt refusing Scotland the opportunity to use the pound? Nothing.

<|startoftext|>@disasterhistory @BorisJohnson Absolutely...perplexing....aside of every single word he utters and every promise he makes there is literally no evidence whatsoever that johnson is an inveterate liar<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DrLukeMcDonagh Johnson is pandering to a diminishing band of supporters...the diminishment will be ramped up within weeks and months of a no deal.

<|startoftext|>@Faudaville Yeah...but Vincent...what about his rapier-like wit?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SmoggyPower I think you've credited him with a bit too much maturity there<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lord_prefab @ItRecks This is most definitely a project owned and managed by a little england that's getting smaller by the day. Scotland is on a completely different trajectory and there simply is no compromise to be had anymore.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SamiraNadkarni Great article. Absolutely nails where we are on this whole #BrexitShambles whatever your point of view. If the UK operates in bad faith to avoid the EU operating in bad faith then don't be surprised when bad faith bites you on the arse.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArcticMenthol aye...fair to say we've all missed his rapier like wit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daverking Francois has a lot on his plate right now and we all know how rapaciously exhausting that can be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidHardstaff @cliodiaspora Yes..instead the UK exhibits hubris, entitlement and exceptionalism on a massive scale right now. History is history and it cannot be changed but we all know for sure that a 'tribes in trenches' myopia will never end well. England is on a truly grim trajectory.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cliodiaspora A great thread. There is only so much doubling down on dumb a govt can do before there is either a spectacular rebound or a descent into total chaos. It is hard to say which direction England (not UK) will go but signs are not good with cognitive dissonance and stupidity so rife.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UKPLAS johnson is an empty vessel, a blank canvas being used by far more malign powers...just an 'eloquent' mouthpiece for cummings and his puppetmasters.

<|startoftext|>@IdleBirder @GHarrisReid @mikegalsworthy It is baby steps to goose steps...with covid proving an adequate cover for their stealthy deception. Each and everyone of this tory muppet show will, at some point in the near future, be held accountable for their actions. They are all beyond contempt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GHarrisReid @mikegalsworthy They want a #nodeal #brexit...plain and simple...just create a completely false narrative about the EU that only their imbecilic supporters will buy into and hey presto...the vacant johnson's puppeteers get what they want and everyone else can go to hell.

<|startoftext|>@Scotpol1314 @theSNP This is the worst and most destructive UK govt in history.

<|startoftext|>@hairychesters All true...the language being used by the tories in these negotiations is excruciatingly embarrassing...like a toddler who thinks his teddy bear is about to be taken away when it clearly isn't.

<|startoftext|>@smcardle45 This toxic tory turdfest of a govt will eventually see their purile pointless populism run out of road.

<|startoftext|>@grumpymann_72 @murdo_fraser This appears to be the actions of a wildly out of control, regressive and incompetent UK govt at a point in time when folks need as much guidance as possible.

<|startoftext|>@pmdfoster @ff @MureDickie @PickardJE @michaelgove @GeorgeWParker @RishiSunak @BorisJohnson @rafaelbehr This is straight out of the 1930s nazi playbook.

<|startoftext|>@pmdfoster @ff @MureDickie @PickardJE @michaelgove @GeorgeWParker @RishiSunak @BorisJohnson @rafaelbehr Great thread. Scotland could always UDI. The real flattulent elephant in the room is the unpredictable impact of a #nodeal #brexit ..the tories are playing with fire assuming leavers stay loyal and remainers fail to get sufficiently energised.

<|startoftext|>@OrpheusEU The UK - or little England to be more precise - is slowly sliding towards failed state status. Suicidal politicking from bumbling boris and the shambles squad #brexit Dumagoguery on steroids.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SoundbiteCultur We need big bold systemic ideas to tackle this.

<|startoftext|>@agoodfireburns All totally plausible and shocking.

<|startoftext|>@Faudaville @Unionbuster aint we all ;-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Faudaville @thevoicebloke We may well have already passed it..in which case we are urinating in a hurricane...there's a lot of data and evidence to suggest that is the case unfortunately. It's almost better to be in the dark.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Faudaville @thevoicebloke Yep...the direction of travel is pretty damn clear - hockey stick curves and all that - and it aint pretty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Faudaville @thevoicebloke * Perhaps I should have said 'ideas are out there' rather than answers ;-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Faudaville @thevoicebloke Agreed. This is true. Hence the need to redefine our motivations and attachments if we are to survive as a species. The answers are out there...they just require quite a radical reapparaisal of how we organise this 'civilisation' thing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Faudaville @thevoicebloke Eventually we have to rebound back to progress...tribes in trenches solves diddley squat especially when we face so many existential threats that require collective action and co-operation. Otherwise I think we know the answer ;-)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheGlobalSpring What is the point of holding on to something untenable and irrational ie the union.

<|startoftext|>@homelesshorse @shonad7674 Absolutely. There is a vibrant energy around independence that looks outward and towards a better future, not the 'more of the same' naval gazing backwardism displayed by tories.

<|startoftext|>@freeworlder Yep..we are on a lamentable backward trajectory right now at the precise time when we need the opposite.

<|startoftext|>@Superfind @SkyNews Absolutely...just plain bad news planning from all the channels...it's just froth. A million more important things happening around the world. Lazy journalism from the MSM but then that is the norm these days and partly explains why we are where we are right now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChrisStirk @John2Win @Douglas4Moray @ScotTories @pressjournal Exactly. Every word they utter achieves precisely the opposite effect. It's a clarion wake up call for folks who are slowly seeing thru the wilfully negligent tory ideology...an ideology that offers no hope or path forward, just backward steps to a world that never existed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BritishAlba @John2Win @Douglas4Moray @ScotTories @pressjournal By May 2021 with five months of a no deal brexit you'll be struggling to find a tory anywhere in the UK let alone in Scotland for the #Scotgov elections. Their dinosaur populism has no place in this world. They represent backwardism on steroids.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@inverness1985 @John2Win @Douglas4Moray @ScotTories @pressjournal @BorisJohnson Too right although they'll never admit to that. They'll just keep doubling down on dumb in the hope that the dumb keep backing them. The latest crop of tories are a blight on all our futures with nothing to offer bar more demolition, division and austerity. They offer no hope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheMassHistoria The ideas are out there but they get no oxygen. The left right paradigm only exists because of capitalism, a system that has no chance of solving our existential threats. The weight of necessity will either see us survive and thrive thru collaboration or disappear into the night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BlogAlba @verbisan I think we are all just urinating in a force 10 gale with this virus.. just reflects the malaise our species is in with regard to so many issues!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@frankendodo Symbolic of the backwardism that has seized hold in the last four years..harking back to a time that never existed, delusions of grandeur and unjustified exceptionalism reflected in language designed to brainwash those unwilling to think or analyse reality. Wake up time beckons<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@keviney01 @IainDale @DavidGauke @maxatkinson It is impossible to support something you know and have known for years to be counterintuitive nonsense. The only way of doing so is to let yourself be infected with cognitive dissonance and wait until the wool is pulled from your eyes. When experiences coalesce, brexit is dead.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@John2Win Hold on John..which party called for and held the EU referendum which has fostered more division than we could imagine?? Surely when you talk about division it's best to look inward and ask some searching questions on tory policy. You reap what you sow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@freeworlder absolutely..no one can know what trump will do but you can bet he'll cling to power for grim death. He's a clown..like johnson, bolsonaro, putin etc..just tragic cartoon creations whose arrival has only led to virulent outbreaks of cognitive dissonance and collective stupidity<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@freeworlder Party politics everywhere will be viewed as anachronistic and self defeating in years to come as the weight of necessity and the need for urgent, collaborative and intelligent action becomes apparent. We hope.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FacundoSavala @hamishmacfarlan When your destiny is controlled by deluded idiots and incompetent demagogues then you seek to regain control. Really not rocket science. Almost two thirds of Scots voted to remain in the EU yet are being dragged out against their wishes. Surely you get that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dastardly_Mutt @MarkRStevenson @afneil Hmmm...but there is a solution is there not?! An escape pod to exit the catastrofuck foisted on us by the most incompetent and wilfully negligent government in history. Scotland can and will use that escape pod sooner than we ever imagined #indyref2<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JohnCoy29071630 Nailed on from the start. The tories never had any intention of getting a deal..their shady paymasters have too much riding on it. It's the most inept, destructive and wilfully negligent govt in history and Scotland needs to make plans to get out pronto. Very pronto.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lindy4Indy2 @parami This man is the lowest of the low...an opinion I've had since I first heard him suggest, around ten years ago, that we buy a new yacht for the queen at the height of austerity.

What a clusterfuck, omnishambles shitshow these toxic tosspot tories have created and now preside over. You really could not make up a bigger tale of incompetence, wilful negligence and corruption if you tried<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AudioKid3 Utter tripe...and now we discover that the tories might appoint "a very senior cabinet minister" to oust Nicola Sturgeon. So that's a 100% fail. Each and every one of their cabinet ministers are completely useless. She will wipe the floor with them with ease.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JournoStephen What's so wrong with change Stephen? What's so wrong about parties within a union wanting to break away through democratic means? What is the point of maintaining a union when one of the parties clearly wants out? I'd love to know!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daveb1893 @MeanwhileScotia Why the hell would Nicola Sturgeon want a seat in the House of Lords??? Please please explain!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The scenes of cowardly police brutality and torture in #Belarus are sickening. Beating by beating, #Lukaschenko and his cabale or primitive savages are writing their own obituary<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>True. This era will be forever known as the age of stupid when a nation decided to commit suicide on the altar of exceptionalism...failing to grasp common sense and logic along the way. You simply have to laugh off such tragic self flagellation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've wanted to live in Scotland for the past 30 years since my first visit. That desire was cemented into action with the brexit result. Scotland has more than enough resources to survive and thrive with a progressive, intelligent and engaged population. England sadly not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlbertoCostaMP Trouble is there is no robust defence...just 'tradition'.. ..change happens all the time and just as the UK voted to leave the EU, so Scotland will vote to leave the union. These are two nations going in polar opposite directions, one outward looking, the other inward looking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mathie_dan Difficult to imagine quite how much lower down the toilet bowl they can go but they keep surprising us with their incredible lack of humanity. Give it a year and they will all be in brown shirts. They'll still get votes though and that is the wholly tragic aspect of all this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Very entertaining...even the genuine one! Ever get the feeling we should treat this whole life thing as just some ironic sit com with the latest episode being particularly unfunny?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mistywoman1 This cannot be serious.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jezobrien @groverdPO @PeteSchofield6 @ForPasty @SkyNews And also we are now seeing three little words that reveal the utter shambolic nonsense of #Brexit ..."ECONOMIES OF SCALE"...the bigger the market, the better the deal... impossible to match the trade deals the UK already has in place through the EU. Zero logic, zero wisdom<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Way too far down the rabbit hole Rosie...tories will only ever deal with surface realities and will never ever look deeper down for the real causes. Too much effort for them hence we revisit the same issues again and again. History on loop. Tragic.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@joymorrissey Education should never affirm or encourage an immoral world view and that is precisely what 'conservatism' delivers Joy based on the last decade of negligence. Education is about progress and building a better future not backwardism and monumental stupidity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joymorrissey Precisely because Joy your party has presided over the most divisive, destructive and wilfully negligent policies in UK history. Your austerity, your nonsense EU referendum and your incompetent mismanagement of covid19 etc etc etc etc have got us here. You know that deep down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every single aspect of life has worsened after a decade of #tories ...even the possibilities for our future #socialcare yet the UK (well England) still blindly supports these numpties...beyond absurd, beyond parody.

<|startoftext|>@greyscull47 @michaelgove @AngusRobertson Precisely. You cannot agree to something that is the opposite trajectory of the direction in which you wish to travel.

<|startoftext|>@freeworlder The profit motive (and indeed money) will never deal with the existential issues we face re #climateemergency and #inequality..it simply cannot do anything other than exacerbate them and only atomises us at the point in time when we need to be collaborating more than ever.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@brawday It's the people of Scotland who will decide on their future, not yet another failed, incompetent, tory minion.

<|startoftext|>@ChrissieGrech @whnlaws Just the tip of a very large, monumentally mismanaged iceberg. There's a point where sheer incompetence becomes wilful negligence and corruption...the #tories passed that point a long time ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely..steady as she goes in the midst of the biggest pandemic of our age is the only course of action. Focus on the priority of saving lives and when we're thru it we can focus on self determination...with determination! Support will only grow with this approach<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>If only these folks could be made to google 'methane', 'permafrost' and 'Siberia' ..they'd soon realise the mindblowing scale of the climate emergency, an existential priority that will not be solved by retreating to tribes in trenches...massive change needed yet we go backwards?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@seebsouq Even now, after 4 years of seeing the US (and UK for that matter) descend rapidly down the toilet bowl, it's impossible to understand how someone so absurd, so obnoxious and so clearly damaging to all our futures could gain 1 vote let alone millions.

<|startoftext|>The single biggest cause of our problems is the system. There's no other culprit.

<|startoftext|>Since the crash of 2007/8 we’ve seen austerity, poverty and inequality become the catalysts for #Syria, #Brexit, #Trump etc. When money gets tight we become tribes in trenches and pull up the drawbridge. We can never learn from history  https://t.co/bA4y57b5GG<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nealerichmond Yep...the phrase 'economies of scale' seems to suit the tory muppet show when talking about #Scotland #indyref2 but they are strangely silent when it comes to #brexit.

<|startoftext|>@disasterhistory @ByMikeBaker Such a vast chasm has opened up between folks that nothing would surprise me. Trump and the UK will keep doubling down on dumb until they can go no further and that's when they'll seek out the jackboot. History as you know just repeats itself.

<|startoftext|>@disasterhistory @ByMikeBaker I don't think he has any intention of respecting November's election...he will do anything to keep hold of power. He has no chance of winning democratically. Expect a trump inspired false flag between now and the vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Baby steps to goose steps. It's clear that the delusional despot #Trump will either initiate a false flag either domestically or internationally and/or just ignore or cancel November's vote.

<|startoftext|>No words....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bpfbpf2 Denying #climatechange is like denying that we need food.

<|startoftext|>@Chiclanagirl Utterly pathetic but sadly predictable. Depressing that any nation, let alone the UK, could act in such a naive and blinkered way but there has been muppets in power for a decade now, acting like spoilt toddlers. Still...you reap what you sow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bpfbpf2 It's the last flattulent gasp of the greedy, fat white man..soon to be a minority, he's chosen not to go quietly into the night and instead is having a bit of a stomp. All civilisations and cultures end up having clowns as 'leaders' in their final days!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bpfbpf2 Absolutely. Effectively it's always inequality that's too blame for our prediliction to repeat mistakes but we don't like to admit it. Trouble is...nations like US and UK are pulling up drawbridge at the precise moment when we all need to be working collaboratively re climate<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bpfbpf2 It's made a difference...makes us think our views somehow matter. Combine this type of platform with a big financial crash, austerity and 'religious' violence and it's an explosive mixture that divides us and gets us to where we are. History on loop just with twitter added!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bpfbpf2 History teaches us that war is generally around the corner whenever we retreat to tribes in trenches. When money gets tight, scapegoats are sought and division is sown.

<|startoftext|>"We had a referendum on breaking up the union only six years ago." #BorisJohnson #Scotland  ...NO Boris...you had a referendum on breaking up the union FOUR years ago.

<|startoftext|>@DavidHenigUK Absolutely. Scotland as a sovereign nation would be a key player within the EU due to its inate desire to engage with principles and processes...ability to do that in a union is nil.

<|startoftext|>@Always_a_Yes @BorisJohnson Aye...I think it may well be the single most effective thing he's done to date as PM of the UK...he'll play a real part in helping to reduce his workload and constitutional burden if he's on his normal blunderbus form.

<|startoftext|>@krishgm Yes..when you're deep in a hole then just double down and double down some more ...rather than double back. It's a herd immunity approach from the tories for the cognitive dissonance virus.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KlausBlatter @Annc33080408 The world has changed dramatically since 2014. Scotland is now on a different trajectory altogether.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EFM_1 Hopefully not..you'd imagine and hope that both are running out of road and will no longer have any power whatsoever within a few months.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Annc33080408 @KlausBlatter Absolutely...Scotland has long been heading in a different, far more progressive and outward looking direction..I was just generalising based on where the UK currently is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TherealNihal Cognitive dissonance is far more virulent than covid19 unfortunately...when social chasms are needlessly created by stupid politicians they only only grow in size to the point where it's almost impossible to bridge them<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KlausBlatter The UK is just a theatre of the absurd right now Klaus and has been for 4 or 5 years. A nonsensical, ridiculous land where common sense has long since departed. Unfortunately cognitive dissonance is a far more dangerous virus than covid19.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TherealNihal The AGE OF STUPID!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnharris1969 Hi John...this might be a site worth profiling in one of your @guardian editorials @sharebayorg ...just launched, it's a site where folks can share their skills, items etc freely with other people around the world. A great example of the 'commons' in action.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mearnsgal @TheRosie George Floyd's words "I can't breath" couldn't be more apocryphal :-(<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheRosie We've got to get to 2021 first ;-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ABritInBrussels Safe to say folks like @DPrairies need sympathy and help rather than engagement. Three years of tweeting on this address and I've never been blocked for stating the bleedin' obvious. You have to laugh!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPrairies @ABritInBrussels @SadiqKhan @ActivistKelly The real issue here is the competency of those doing the negotiating on behalf of the UK. Must be crystal clear to anyone with a brain that they are as close to useless as it's possible to be.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPrairies @ABritInBrussels @SadiqKhan @ActivistKelly I'd say the wholesale trashing of an economy that is already on its knees with covid19 thru a no deal might be a considerably stronger affront to democracy but hey ho...anything can pass for common sense these days eh?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Glic16 The irony is not lost! I'm assuming they'll be adopting the same approach on behalf of the protests in the US with the trump administration...but I suspect not given they need to bend over backwards. Even more irony ...not lost!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Strandjunker 10% of any population will want this plus 30%+ of folks whose conservatism is sufficient to allow them to be brainwashed and hoodwinked by the populists will enable it. It's up the rest of us to unite behind a coherent, progressive and wise vision.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tressish @BillyLiar10 It will soon become clear that these folks need sympathy not engagement. Backward views, devoid of any context or intelligence at all, just need to be ignored. They have far too much wool over their eyes. Consider it a duty of care.  https://t.co/lCRihZZUf5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Faced with a three-fold crisis of racial, health and economic disasters, we have a three-year-old in the Oval Office." @RichardWolffe. Most 3-year-olds would be offended by that statement but we get your point! Great article 4 years in the making.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anne_sones Physical violence against the people is always the last refuge of a system and a government that lacks wisdom,  intelligence and vision. It's their only option because they have nothing else to offer; Trump undoubtedly the most disgraceful POTUS in history..and maybe the last.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Surailian @NorthLeftVoices @BorisJohnson Pumped up egos with nothing to offer other than pointless slogans and backwardism. All civilisations that are on their last legs opt for clowns to rule with the US and UK opting for comedy show panelists and reality TV narcissists. The wake up and rebound will be spectacular.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SueSuezep I think most of those who backed boris and voted trump know this is the case but it's far easier to double down than double back. It's a pride thing and we all know what that comes before ;-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SueSuezep No coincidence at all. Isolationism and exceptionalism will never win through precisely because the existential issues we face are global. They'll gain short term traction with the disenchanted but sooner or later even they must wake up to the absurdity of these myopic 'leaders'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cualey Nothing at all would surprise me these days!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@northumbrian_ @turkishmerc Ambivalent. Everything happens for a reason. We're a fucked up species that rarely gets anything right these days!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesMelville @67Snowy Aye..it should no longer be about engagement...but sympathy and empathy with folks infected with the cognitive dissonance virus. They need our help!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@northumbrian_ And then, just like that, the tweet is gone...this new twitter cillit bang works a treat ;-) @northumbrian_  @turkishmerc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@northumbrian_ Feel like I'm on a very old Hornby train right now...everything is just a wind up!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@northumbrian_ Sorry mate..irony monday..couldn't resist ;-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nevillehurst2 @tired1967 Let them inhabit their fantasy realm for God's sake Nev! It is there that they feel safest and most comfortable...right now!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seebsouq You have to cling on to the vague hope that vast quantities of wool will be shed from eyes in time. The dam will burst at some point..you'd hope!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's that damned phrase 'economies of scale' ..never mentioned in the EU referendum..we really should have all learnt what it meant in school. It's always been the excessively flattulent elephant in the room when it comes to brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think it's "irony Monday" for me today..start the week off with a wry ironic smile at the path humanity appears to be on ;-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bazfor Serious question Baz and don't take this the wrong way but at what point in time and what will it finally take to remove the wool from your eyes? The evidence is stark on pretty much everything right now re this govt &amp; brexit ..but I do admire your stubborn resistance ;-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A bit of doggy style from the UK in US trade negotiations bizarrely ...who'd have thunk it about this glorious, such well-timed #brexit. I thought the UK held all the cards on everything?! @HuffPost   https://t.co/KCDTWAVThZ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@northumbrian_ Without doubt the sane people my friend..you are slowly seeing the light ;-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Well..the BAD NEWS folks is that we are headed for fascism. The GOOD NEWS is that it will be a ridiculous Dads Army style fascism, an absurd authoritarianism so poorly and laughably instituted by imbeciles that it will devour itself by the end of the first series<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Wera_Hobhouse @Sonnet_Lumiere The flush is busted..They'll limp on for a bit but they really have nothing to offer anyone at all...a singularly incapable collection of charlatans who should never be close to power again...and all who voted for them secretly know it. Funny if it were not so critical.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SCBeachWriter Pink pyjama clad hippos with star trek phasers<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrianUkulele @shirleymcbrinn In any other realm of experience this would be an awful pilot episode of a rather crappy sitcom that has zero chance of being commissioned. When you realise this is the reality we inhabit, you're persuaded by the Hindu idea of Maya, that everything is illusion!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SCBeachWriter And three headed lions wielding nuclear pistols<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty much sums up everything going about this ridiculous and farcical #trump presidency..an ultimate theatre of the absurd..even the most committed #MAGA adherent could not deny a word of this. The show is over once and for all.   https://t.co/yxuMfV9L78<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The slow creep towards fascism and rabid authoritarianism just turned into a jog. Baby steps to goose steps is getting all too real. We've the most pitiful and inept 'leaders' in history at the helm at the most dangerous of times. Dominoes are toppling across the US #nycprotests<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>A voice for real progress and sentiments we ignore at our peril. Please RT. #RBE @EconofHappiness @TheVenusProject @tzmglobal @MoneyfreePlanet<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please RT. These are the kind of ideas that we all need to adopt. Park the ego and get involved.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everything will be crystal clear as long as we avoid the collective amnesia that ensures we constantly repeat our mistakes. We are a species that is capable of so much more than where we are now but we have to think holistically and dig deeper for the real answers #RBE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NicolaSturgeon @daTARTANSPARTAN Yes..probably best that he sticks to what he knows best...although that really doesn't cover much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoRemainNoGain @Luckylilybee We always vote in clowns masquerading as strongmen at times like this. Their incompetence, impotence and myopia soon becomes clear and the 2nd law of thermodynamics goes full flow. Wisdom and vision needed but none 2 b seen right now. Worst leaders ever at the worst possible time<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoRemainNoGain @Luckylilybee It's over ten years since the last crash..for 2008 see 1929..history just repeats itself on loop when it never ever ever solves the real systemic, underlying issues. Austerity creates populist tribes in trenches every time this happens as minds are locked down. So predictable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seebsouq Summed up perfectly. History - if it gets to be written ;-) - will judge him as a creator of the age of stupid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@parami How about using a chamber for the @HouseofCommons  shaped like #Holyrood.. the current set up is ridiculous and has never made sense. 'Tradition' gets you so far but defies common sense..way more space..less of the stupid face off style of politics. WM is way way behind the curve<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Roger_Xanth_Day Mein Kampf???!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>What is saddening is just how few folks out there engage with this sort of content. If you do the digging and get yourself further down the rabbit hole you cannot deny that wholesale, radical, holistic change is needed if we are to deal with the #climateemergency and inequality<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seebsouq Baby steps to goose steps and it's been that way ever since June 24 2016...I would imagine there's around 10% of folks that would embrace fascism with gusto...and another 30% who could sleepwalk the rest of us into a dire dystopia. Bizarre to actually be typing these words.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Complyorcry @BorisJohnson Yep....it was patently clear from way before day one. Years before!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just listening to the #Lovegod album by the #SoupDragons for the first time in a while. Immaculate, bringing back hazy memories of student life in the early 90s. Can anyone explain how and why they didn't become the biggest band in the world?? @HifiSean<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's time for a radical rethink on how we do 'life'. The monetary system needs to be challenged effectively and wisely. Infinite growth on a finite planet together with rapidly increasing inequality is a recipe for disaster #TZM #TVP #RBE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mistywoman1 I agree...it's just so difficult to equate tory with anything close to integrity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Luckylilybee I suspect, I hope that's the real reason however I'm afraid trust in this tory shower o' shite govt disappeared a long long time ago if it ever existed at all.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FREEALBA2 A very rare show of tory integrity or a sacrificial lamb on the altar of unionism? Nothing should surprise us about these charlatans.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Am I reading too much into this but does some tory junior govt minister for #Scotland resigning over the #DominicCummings shitstorm seem a bit contrived given he said nothing beforehand. Either an incredibly rare show of integrity from a tory...or something more underhand?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@80_mcswan  https://t.co/ZzkL8pobTA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SmoggyPower just a very grim, badly scripted, unfunny sit com...we live in the midst of a theatre of the absurd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bazfor I have no idea what nikegate is tbh..is it bigger than the report into Russia influencing the UK's democratic processes?! ;-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bazfor I think the SDP disappeared a long time ago ;-) ..the SNP have said loads on it. Every single day of this crisis is a very steep and vicious learning curve for every government. No one is getting it 100% right but some are doing it far better than others.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carolecadwalla Absolutely...he'll still be pulling all the strings in the background regardless. The his-tory party would be even more of an impotent lame duck without him<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bazfor You'd likely have a very different view if you lived in Scotland Barry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NorthLeftVoices @JohnSmi53881214 We also need NOTA...none of the above...@NOTAcampaign (maybe mandatory voting too?)..if folks are disillusioned with a political system they should have the right to express that view. If there's a majority then there should be a clearly defined process to amend that system.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Glasgows_girl A lot will feel the same way but these folks and this message is currently a vocal part of scotland. Only the rabid bullshit of social media (we shud all include ourselves in that)makes it so. It will only ever run out of steam in the face of common sense and shared experience.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The real tragedy of our times is that if you'd have said 10 years ago we'd have #brexit #trump #BorisJohnson #Bolsonaro etc, you'd have thought it an absurd sitcom. The fact we have this shower in charge now in the midst of covid19 just confirms the absurdity. We all know it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bazfor Brexit's just a word Barry. It means a million different things to a million different people. What is more damaging is the direction of travel it takes us in. Tribes in trenches never ever ever ever ever ever lasts for more than a few years at best. Eventually you have to engage<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Charlottemayb To be fair Charlotte...pretty much everyone on the planet has done a better job than us..with the exception, strangely enough, of only those nations with erm..regressive governments like that in the UK. The similarities are stark. Shame we don't get that communicated to us.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@wonderofthis Advaita. Not two. I recall reading "Advaita" and Aldous Huxley's "Perennial Philosophy" at the same time. No drug, legal or not, could deal with the head fuck that those two books create in combination! Utter clarity. Third eye squeedgied!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@edralis @Aella_Girl So feckin true!!!! You've nailed it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bazfor But then I get the feeling that these words are always wasted..just another twitter tantrum! We will all only ever see life thru the filters that experience has handed us. We need dialogue and mutual respect across an ever increasing chasm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bazfor I understand you're very attached to your brexit. I can see &amp; read that but beyond the word, what is there?? In an era that we will have to work together more than ever ..if only for our kids and grandkids sakes...we chose to chart our own course. You see how that makes no sense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bazfor Why is it always about right or left Barry? How's about we think differently and let common sense playing a role? What was it Einstein said: 'We can't solve our problems with the same thinking that created them'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So true! If there's one person out there that's so far behind the curve as to be untrue it's this lass. Light years behind the FM even through the most subjective and honest of filters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davemacladd I recall almost 3 months ago thinking...why don't we temp check every person entering the UK..like China and Asian nations do regularly? Why did we wait until now to try to bolt the stable door after the horse has fucking done one?! These things are not rocket science ffs!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bazfor The Tories will only ever be about selfishness, personal agrindisement and greed. That is why they exist...to influence society along that tack. That's a given that cannot be denied despite their 'opportunity for all' bollocks.Some times we all have to work together 2 solve shit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bazfor Well..not ideologically speaking obviously - and you know socialist ideals are more about the collective - but thru your filter I guess, yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bazfor But I think you know that Barry!! ;-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bazfor Hi Barry...the trouble is at the worst possible time in our lives we have the worst possible motivations held by our elected leaders. That cannot be denied. Tory party values are not about caring for you one iota. They are the literal opposite. Those values are distilled by Patel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bazfor You do seem to spend a massive amount of time listening to him Barry despite disagreeing with everything he says...maybe try some music station instead?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@chrismcg21 Anyone and everyone but themselves. Beyond contempt, beyond comprehension #NHSSurcharge #carehomes<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SueSuezep Cue silence. Deafening silence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@middle_voter @NoIAmTonyGreen Without hope we have nowt. Folks have to believe that the rebound from this current aberration will be spectacular. We are exhibiting all the symptoms of a declining civilisation ie bread and circuses, clowns in charge... new visions will claw back this regress.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Frances__Carlin Cannot disagree with a word of that. I'm no sycophant and find it difficult to follow political 'leaders' but she's proved herself light years ahead of the shower in westminster ever since 2014 and continues to do so with calm wisdom.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@middle_voter @NoIAmTonyGreen Money only gets you so far. Eventually imo folks will see thru the tripe served up by most of the media when experience impacts them directly. Too many hoodwinked and enchanted currently by a distorted ideological 'vision' that can never deliver progress. I'm an optimist!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vhb49 @BogardeAlbie @JMPSimor Absolutely. English exceptionalism has a lot to answer for. Sad that so many folks don't realise that our direction of travel can never ever end well. History proves it again and again and again. Only so far you can go down this tribes in trenches road before imploding.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nelsims411 I don't believe human nature has a default position. IMO the environment and culture shapes it. If it's a survival of the fittest ethos then we all tend to follow in line. We need to change that environment with radical progressive ideas and holistic thinking.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pickledpuffin Vital skills that should be part of every curriculum. Empowering kids with these skills makes it easier for them to overcome fear. If we all knew we could survive regardless of whatever the 'system' throws at us, we'd be in a much better place.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yes_leemills @NicolaSturgeon Now here is a proper leader!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Charlot13896022 @NoIAmTonyGreen An apt image given the muppet show that passes for governance these days  https://t.co/rM6lpcV5i3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Charlot13896022 @NoIAmTonyGreen Those that support this tory govt and populist regimes of trump, bolsarno etc are like frogs in warming water...many will not detect the temperature rise but many more will hop out and reject this dehumanising backwardism. We have no choice. Double back not double down.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoIAmTonyGreen Most definitely not..merely a blip in the road..a very unpleasant and regressive blip but a blip nonetheless. 'Progress' however you define it will rebound spectacularly with a caveat..creeping fascistic authoritarianism has to be challenged and rejetected by the majority<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimonPease1 @MrRemain One that cares diddley squat for its population. A government, so inept, so wilfully negligent and so backwards in its thinking to be beyond belief. A government that continually doubles down on dumb because it's got nowhere else to go. A complete shambles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time for international service perhaps?..millions of young people seeing the world doing constructive work for communities everywhere, a volunteer army that will not only deliver incredible progress but also empower themselves with a new collective vision<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Smokey29773580 @owl_wide Maybe instead the UK should just grow up and stop inhabiting a fairytale fantasy of servitude. We really don't need a 'symbolic leader' in any way shape or form. We need real leaders altho I'm fucked if I can see any of those around right now. Monarchy is just so yesterday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe time to start building a world where money means nothing because it sure as hell won't mean sweet fa for millions if not billions @Channel4News when simple survival is the aim after this virus eventually abates<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Please @Channel4News ..do not interviews idiots like Iain Duncan Smith. It's an instant turnover I'm afraid. His dysfunctional and backward views just exacerbate anger and really need no oxygen whatsoever.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>People now need a purpose, an objective, a common goal and that will be how best to dismantle a system that has got us here. It really is time to wake up to far better ideas but we all need to change our attachments, our expectations and motivations. Money don't cut it no more!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@henrietta_22 @owl_wide @pritipatel This will forever be known as the era of stupid possibly. we have a govt continually doubling down on dumb rather than doubling back.

<|startoftext|>@johnharris1969 @PositiveMoneyUK Just stay open minded and aware of new ideas..a rare commodity in journalism...incredible credible thinking is out there John @EconofHappiness ...maybe pop in to this event as a pointer   https://t.co/FwWxt0XL6s<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seebsouq Hmmm...a tough one! ;-) ...maybe a place where democracy disappeared in double quick time... where the will of a myopic and ideologically driven minority all of a sudden usurped the majority. Just can't think!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@johnharris1969 Great article John.

<|startoftext|>@Emmselk They get channelled down an ideological track that's getting thinner by the day and they've managed to enable and prop up the most wilfully negligent and incompetent govts in history over the past decade. The real stories and facts go awol when poisonous, divisive rhetoric rules<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Emmselk Sadly predictable. You do ask yourself what was going thru the mind of the 'journalist' ordered to write this. Objective journalistic integrity is thrown to the wind for all those deciding to work on these tory shilling shit rags. Not journalists but advertising copywriters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@catherinemep Brexit is and always has been nonsense. Just from a basic common sense pov it is counterintuitive. Not achieving simple economies of scale re trade deals to be compounded by going toe to toe with your biggest customer. Madness at a time when we have bigger much fish to fry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seebsouq @fcunion_en Isn't St Pauli operated along similar lines? A sort of Green Bay Packers approach from gridiron.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Days before seeking #bankruptcy protection, #JCPenney paid nearly $10m in bonuses to top executives."...and herein folks lies the big problem with #capitalism..those at the very top have been creaming off a rapidly increasing % of profits for decades. Snouts gorging in a trough.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sairny She's a despicable individual. The fact she has any power at all speaks volumes for where we are right now. Common sense long since departed. Let's hope Patel follows soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seebsouq Loads of folks trying to sell you services you don't need but precious little benefits. Just another shop window for folks to wander past.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SkyNews Why is there any surprise at this? Lying is what Boris does, his key skill.

Fantasy rules.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Daily_Record Absolutely...Scotland seems ahead of the curve in terms of actually valuing and caring for its citizens which only strengthens communities and nation as a whole<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@seebsouq As much outdoors learning as possible including within the community / Combine history and geography / Emphasis on partnering with other schools in other countries / More 'autonomy' for pupils / Increase interaction with businesses / Focus on valuing thinking as well as learning<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brexit_sham Someone really should have mentioned the phrase 'economies of scale' before the EU referendum. No amount of chest beating can hide the fact that you'll get shafted on trade deals if you don't operate collectively.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SueSuezep A badge of honour Sue..wear it with pride whoever this Nadine Doris character is...presumably just another populist chancer realising that their time in the sun is coming to an end<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HewstoneGraham @iaintheeuropean Nothing. It's been a nonsense since day one but far too many have been fed tripe by those who would benefit. Isolationism gets you nowhere, only collective action delivers progress.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Housemartin73 absolutely!!! nailed it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>See...you can change the world!!...start by checking in to WORLD LOCALIZATION DAY - JUNE 21 2020 A world-changing programme of inspirational talks, interviews, films, humour and music #WorldLocalizationDay @EconofHappiness  https://t.co/FwWxt0XL6s #coronavirus #COVID19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pickledpuffin That's 250 or so nurses, teachers etc. Obscene tbh.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Vicktor1111 There's no common sense. Had there been any 4 years ago we wouldn't even be talking about brexit. It's just counterintutive nonsense that makes less sense by the day. Whatever prism you view politics through, you can't deny that common sense was furloughed years ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bazfor Keep ploughing that lone furrow Barry. Strangely admirable. The current story about care home infection strategy should disgust you more than anything. That's objective news based on facts and the more facts we learn, the more attrocious this govt becomes. Surely obvious?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@1sttimedad @davemacladd The main is nothing but a comedy charicature with absolutely nothing to offer our collective futures. The fact he has power and isn't confined to a comic book just speaks volumes about where we are at. He represents the very worst of us and folks for some reason lap it up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think we all realise that right now the UK and US have the worst possible leaders at the worst possible time. Even those who support #trump and #johnson know it but chose to gamble with their own and their childrens' futures. A nihilism that trump and johnson merely reflect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CeciliaBTory @NicolaSturgeon Does this person really exist? How can anyone be so naive? At what point does the big mound of wool over your eyes disappear?

<|startoftext|>@DeanL29497139 Please...someone in the US explain to me how and why this total idiot got anywhere near power let alone into the WH. He has no redeeming features whatsoever.

<|startoftext|>@Glasgows_girl I think it's called 'make it up as you go along'....trouble is you really couldn't make it up when it comes to this tragicomedy muppet show of a government. Tories will just say any old shite because there's nowt else they can do<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@josepgoded Yes!! The concept is totally outdated. Princes and princesses in fairytale castles is an idea that's way past its sell by date and little more than a sit com of servitude. As for the 'divine' right of monarchs..all it does it institutionalise inequality and bar real progress.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@LouiseRawAuthor @owl_wide 'Do as I say, not as I do' has long been a tory mantra. Far too many spellbound by a party that ultimately will only ever have the best interests of themselves and their paymasters at heart. Tragic that so many lap it up in an era when we patently need so much better.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanielFooksArt @JayneEdwards2 @Peston Such a shame.

<|startoftext|>@yonners Brilliant!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Glasgows_girl It is getting there and will get there and it will be a beautiful day when it happens.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Glasgows_girl It's a nation with real empathy and wisdom, something so sadly lacking south of the border. England will unfortunately almost always be tory until it realises that exceptionalism never ever gets you anywhere as history proves. You merely go round in circles with that approach.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Glasgows_girl That said, Scottish independence has to take as big a percentage of the population with it as it can. Experience teaches us 52/48 or similar will never suffice. It needs to be more like 62/38 plus in order to succeed. That is the real test. Once there, it's a gimme!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Glasgows_girl I am English but made the conscious decision to move to Scotland precisely because of its lasndscapes and people with whom I feel I share a far more common bond. Scotland will fly on its own precisely because of the energy and idealism of those that believe it can.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Glasgows_girl Scotland and England have been heading in opposite ideological directions for a decade now under tory misrule. The connections will always be strong but there comes a point when you realise your own intentions are simply not shared. Progress cannot be paired with backwardism.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Glasgows_girl Scotland has always looked outwards with an intelligent and practical eye. It's a nation that does not revel in delusions of grandeur so when you have a westminster govt continually doubling down on dumb sooner or later the dam breaks. I have to be positive about this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusieQinFrance @bbcnickrobinson @rapsiencyn @Telegraph Effective mainstream media scrutiny is on furlough and has been for way too long with this govt. Most journalists enter their profession with the best intentions but find themselves sucked into a vortex of myopic subjectivity by their tory supporting paymasters.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@nickmorristt @BorisJohnson Oh Nicholas...where to start with this one?! "A man determined to restore hope"....just start by replacing 'restore' with 'erase' and you'll be on the right track. You'll soon see it in stark relief.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@judecambridge @bbcnickrobinson @rapsiencyn @Telegraph Hope springs eternal but I get your point. There's a helluva lot of wool to pull from a helluva lot of eyes but even the most comatose cannot deny we are being led by donkeys. Even cognitive dissonance fades with experience eventually.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bbcnickrobinson @rapsiencyn @Telegraph Was there no one in Turkey able to oversee the delivery and check them? Of course not. The level of incompetence displayed by this govt knows no bounds. We all knew it but few realised it would be bought into such stark relief so soon. Even the heavily duped are waking up now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EuropeanEUEU A chicken...so apt...a cock...so apt!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Glasgows_girl The case for self determination grows stronger by the day when the dominant partners in the union display levels of incompetence and negligence that are beyond comparison in history. Sooner or later even the most hoodwinked wake up to that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Housemartin73 @JonesCitizen Yep..the limitations of populism are clear for all to see. There can never be a future for a myopic and naive approach to governance. History proves that time and again. Reverting to tribes in trenches will only ever sustain itself for a few years at most.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonesCitizen @Chanctonman We all knew #Trump, #Johnson, #Bolsonaro etc were not fit to govern before the #COVID19 virus. Now it's being bought into sharp focus for those that backed them. Do not vote incompetent, irresponsible clowns into positions of power. How simple does that message have to be?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JonesCitizen In a word..no. Slowly but surely you get the feeling that folks are waking up to this shambolic clusterfuck of a government. Those duped and brainwashed into thinking 'good ole bojo' represented a good choice as leader are, day by day and death by death, realising their mistake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Surely a measure that should have been in place from the start of March if not before?? Very hard to understand why such a simple concept as temp testing at airports and ports was not initiated from day one.   https://t.co/RThvso8ghP<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DavieIndy @Politicsjunki14 Cognitive dissonance is unfortunately a far more damaging virus than covid19. It is beyond belief that the UK govt wants to persist with a no deal brexit in these surreal times. Even more reason for Scotland to get out and look outwards.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavieIndy @Politicsjunki14 Sadly you are right...it's an unjustified sense of English exceptionalism that is the problem in the UK. These problems are global and have to be addressed as such. Tribes in trenches will never ever solve anything. History tells us that again and again and again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Politicsjunki14 @DavieIndy We desperately need a global radical movement of people who see our current monetary system as the reason we are so deep in the mire on the existential issues of our day #inequality #ClimateEmergency . The bigger picture needs to be addressed in a holistic way and soon.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ronbuch Can there be anyone left in Scotland who cud defend a union with the most inept and wilfully negligent govt in history? The case for self determination gets stronger by the day. Anyone anywhere, not currently lobotomised, care to defend a no deal #brexit and the union #indyref2?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EU_Citizen2 With an economy on its knees, requiring many more years of austerity, the clear logical thing to do for the worst govt in history by a country mile is take a gun to its head with a no deal #brexit. They are simply beyond contempt and beyond help if this is their strategy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Glasgows_girl tory so all of the above<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chrisballingall Spot on. Explains the shambles of brexit too. No responsible govt with any common sense would progress self flagellation at a time when people are on their knees ....but I guess the clue lies in the word 'responsible'. A pointless tracking app is just baby steps to goose steps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chrisballingall Just another ill thought out 'idea' from a govt that has not got the foggiest. Grabs a few headlines, might look good for a day or two but ultimately their own incompetence and negligence will be their undoing yet again. They're urinating in a hurricane.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Religion, money, politics and 'backward' nationalism will never ever solve our problems. Maybe it's time to accept that humans simply do not have the vision or wisdom to create a sustainable future. Technology needs to take the strain in framing our future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The rise of populism is down to an economic system that never lets us learn from our mistakes. Tribes in trenches becomes a default setting when money gets tight but 'we' always gravitate to ideas that are proven not to work..and proven to get us back into the same shit as before<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Couldn't agree more..the issue is why are common sense approaches to our collective global welfare now seemingly on the margins?

<|startoftext|>@marcjarzebowski @TheAwkwardGOP True. But we simply never learn from history. When money gets tight, people get brutal...same every time...and nations retreat to tribes in trenches.

<|startoftext|>@mdouganlpool @DixieRose100 I think the clue lies in the word 'responsible'...this govt has revealed itself to be consistently irresponsible - bordering on negligence - with its actions and therefore continually doubles down on stupid.

<|startoftext|>@fitzscrounger @ArgyleLoz I think we all knew it was. There is quite simply no defence on earth for these actions. Is there anyone anywhere who would care to disagree??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alanferrier @PhilipPullman Anyone who has lost a loved one should sue the asses off these reprihensible politicians.

<|startoftext|>@bendevon2 Disgusting. We all knew it was but to have it confirmed just proves what a disgrace this govt is.

<|startoftext|>@mattduree @SimonUbsdell No Matt. It's about taking the evidence, ie facts and coming to the conclusion that a govt needs to be held to account for its wrecklessness and wilful negligence...or should governments be allowed to get away with anything they want??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@timolarch The biggest deliberate act of self immolation by a nation state in human history. We have actually voted to not just make our lives a bit poorer but a hell of a lot poorer. There is no silver lining to be seen anywhere when it comes to trade deals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pmdfoster A move that defies logic on every single level but then everything the tories have done defies logic as well as intelligence, integrity, common sense and responsibility.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afeduptaxpayer @Nadinekahunter @Iromg @campbellclaret @spikedonline @talkRADIO I don't think Europe ever was a dream but being part of the biggest trade network in the world aided us immensely. It was just the default setting in our lives. To throw that all away in the middle of such uncertain times doesn't strike me as very responsible<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The debate has to start. Capitalism has zero chance of dealing with our existential threats and the current propensity to revert to tribes in trenches just makes things worse. Trouble is no mainstream media is up to the task of raising these issues #RBE #TZM #TVP<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ForestPat1951 That's the point...if folks are dumb enough to think this shambles is up to the task of delivering their own beloved brexit nonsense then I suggest they get their names down for an NHS frontal labotomy...although this will be co-opted out to a US firm by the time of your appt.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MazzardFarm Don't forget the Pacific atoll of Tokelau...and the Pitcairn Islands..just think of all those lovely coconuts..  and stamps.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afeduptaxpayer @Nadinekahunter @Iromg @campbellclaret @spikedonline @talkRADIO Debating on here is essentially pointless...you aint going to change my mind and I aint going to change yours. We will have to wait until our experiences match...that will see us all in agreement that the current direction of travel is nothing but suicidal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afeduptaxpayer @Nadinekahunter @Iromg @campbellclaret @spikedonline @talkRADIO The UK - or England - is retreating to tribes in trenches at the precise time when we all need to be working collectively. History tells us that this small minded approach never ever works and will never work. Simple as that. Just plain old common sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afeduptaxpayer @Nadinekahunter @Iromg @campbellclaret @spikedonline @talkRADIO Not labour at all...more common sense Derek..just plain old common sense. If govt is crap there are rammifications and everything is transparent. The idea of Brexit is just plain nonsense...as in not common sense. All will become clear..just takes a bit longer for some folks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Hellstorm901 Try again!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@harry_winn Why Harry? Why does it need a complete overhaul? Surely replacing skilled experts in their fields with ideologically driven robots is a big, undeniable step towards totalitarianism...straight out of every dictators' handbook.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afeduptaxpayer @Nadinekahunter @Iromg @campbellclaret @spikedonline @talkRADIO Well let's wait and see quite how spectacularly brexit delivers benefits Derek. I think we all know the answer that one when you have such inept, incapable and ideologically pointless tories in charge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afeduptaxpayer @Nadinekahunter @Iromg @campbellclaret @spikedonline @talkRADIO Which countries were financially better prepared for the recession and what caused it Derek? If you're looking for financial irresponsibility then everything pales into insignificance when compared to the effects of brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@richardm680923 @Cat_n_Bagpipes @arusbridger Merely speaks volumes about the uneducated nature of the English electorate. No nation on earth has taken the decision to so comprehensively self immolate itself than England. Let's see what happens in a year or so...I'm sure we will all agree.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DalbidEU @arusbridger @julie4nw Wouldn't be surprised if the UK - or England to be more precise - is being seen as a test bed petri dish for societal collapse by those toxic forces pulling cummings' strings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KingGama8 @maddoxstreetboy @mojos55 And inching bit by bit to fascism - although it won't be branded or framed that way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afeduptaxpayer @Nadinekahunter @Iromg @campbellclaret @spikedonline @talkRADIO Well the more we spaff up the wall on brexit - it's already cost way more than all of our annual contributions put together - the less prepared we will be next time assuming the coronavirus doesn't bring the whole house of cards crashing to the ground.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afeduptaxpayer @Nadinekahunter @Iromg @campbellclaret @spikedonline @talkRADIO Not at all...the recession was caused by way too much debt in the US property market..caused by deregulation a few decades previous. The knock on effects hit every nation on earth which led to austerity, which led to the toxic populism we see today.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afeduptaxpayer @Nadinekahunter @Iromg @campbellclaret @spikedonline @talkRADIO As for being poorly prepared for the recession..every single nation on earth was...and it came about as a result of deregulation foisted on us by thatcher, reagan etc. Sometimes you have to dig a bit deeper to find the real answers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afeduptaxpayer @Nadinekahunter @Iromg @campbellclaret @spikedonline @talkRADIO I've no time for blair but contrast and compare with what the tories have done in the past 10 years. Decimated public services and divided us needlessly with the most ill thought out, nonsensical, self immolating referendum in history. Wilful negligence will be their legacy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afeduptaxpayer @Nadinekahunter @Iromg @campbellclaret @spikedonline @talkRADIO I'm afraid I could not disagree more...the destructive, incompetent nature of the last decade of govt makes the blair years seem like a distant dream. I guess it sums up the two contrasting world views that exist here now. We'll soon be on the same page as I'm sure you're aware.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrexitRewards So so out of her depth and clearly has a sad, tragic, joyless life to hold such views<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JulesSiedenburg In the future it might be an idea to hand government advisers and ministers a map of the world and get them to learn it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@afeduptaxpayer @Nadinekahunter @Iromg @campbellclaret @spikedonline @talkRADIO To be fair Derek I think you'll find Cameron, May and now Johnson have successfully managed to assume that title. Give it a few months and everyone will be on the same page. When experiences coalesce, so do views<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DPJHodges Now where to start with quite how wrong that statement is?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@northumbrian_ It's simple. Boris has played a massive part in opening up a vast chasm in the UK with his lies and deceit and will prove to be destructive to all of our lives in due course. He's a charlatan playing us all for fools. No reason to celebrate him passing on that kind of DNA!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Brown666W @danwootton Too right...it must happen every few months yet goes unreported. What's this one...his 7th, 8th?? Does anyone actually know? Does Boris know?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WordswithSteph @shirleymcbrinn To be fair this is a nation where 38% have decided that corona beer is linked to the coronavirus. Reality or facts are not things that trump supporters take much notice of. They're quite happy on their own planet...just a feckin shame it's this one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrexitBin Laugh at them for they do not know what they are doing. They haven't a fucking clue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anne_sones @JohnWest_JAWS History will judge these imbeciles very harshly. Bojo, Patel, Trump and their deluded paymasters will be known as the 'age of stupid'. History proves that toxic isolationism never ever ends well. Tribes in trenches will never work given the huge existential threats we face.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timhunt92706371 With a no show, empty vessel of a PM acting as little more than a mouthpiece for a poisonous ideology and a Home Secretary so lacking in ability, this is a govt whose time should be up already. The only solution is to laugh at them. Never take a tory seriously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dar42 @OwenHalliday @PoliticsGeek It must be a parody account. He claims to have 'conservative values' yet this govt is so far removed from that. He will wake up when the effect of their disastrous policies impact on him directly. Until then I suppose we should let him enjoy his fantasy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bentrubody Spot on. It's a government that bears more resemblance to the muppet show than a functioning administration. Their flawed ideology can only ever go nowhere...history tells us it never works and it never will.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #tory direction of travel...it's not even in slo-mo now  https://t.co/Cv2GZ2OIdO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OwenHalliday This whole toxic tory cabale is not fit for purpose Owen. You will realise it soon for sure...you're just a bit confused right now. You've caught the cognitive dissonance virus...try not to spread it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrsAitchBee Cognitive dissonance is currently running amok. Too many folks are doubling down on dumb to justify their support for this toxic government, they just don't see it yet. But they will as soon as reality impacts on their lives.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AndyMRoberts The woman is poison...only slightly more virulent than the rest of the tory muppet show that passes as government. This is not my government. History - we hope - will label these times as the 'age of stupid'...whether applied to voters or the showers of shit they put in power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Otto_English You've had your time in the sun Pritti..now shift over and let the next tory imbecile give it a go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BettGunther @acgrayling Boris is the a blank canvas upon which these darker forces you mention impose their poisonous ideology. They cannot win in the long term. The weight of necessity will soon bear down on this toxic tory shower.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acgrayling You can only assume that there is very little joy or happiness in the life of Pritti Patel to be so objectionable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@williamnhutton A government that's not fit for purpose and not fit to govern. Simple as.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JudeChina1 @RAS___________ @hawkeyewolf1 @SkyNewsBreak Yep...all shockingly poor, misguided tory policies. No wonder he's quit. All of these tories are shocking examples of human beings. We will all be in agreement in the not too distant future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tom___Scott @GreenPartyMolly Not one of this rotten cabale are fit for government with pritti proto fascist patel standing out as singularly incapable. She must have an incredibly sad, myopic life to have developed these obnoxious ways and views.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Katy60891492 @veeined Depressingly, a strong correlation I would imagine. Once you've caught the cognitive dissonance bug, it spreads rapidly. The onset of reality will make that mindset redundant in time. When experiences coalesce so do people.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@garyturner196 @scottmcneil3 @eddireader @tartancobweb Give it as year or so and we'll all be on the same page Gary ;-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VM1509 @isthisab0t @VisitScotland @welcomescotland Driven up and over many times. Certainly one of the most stunning roads in Scotland with hundreds of other candidates. Only in the midst of such scenery can you really feel at peace and in awe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ryan_ftd_83 @ScotTories They offer Scotland precisely nothing bar more cognitive dissonance towards their dire tory paymasters in Westminster but they'll fight like wildcats to counter the ever growing urge for independence. They will fail. Folks in Scotland don't swallow the bullshit quite as easily.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@scottmcneil3 @eddireader @tartancobweb I hope that the likes of Boris, Pritti Patel and the rest of this muppet show shower end up behind bars. Their wilful negligence and sheer levels of incompetence are criminal examples of government at its most inept.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@eddireader @lauramarsh70 The lamentable tories just sit there smugly knowing full well that their destructive policies have got us to where we are and that they are safe, propped up by a perennially deluded and misinformed English electorate. Time to get out Scotland!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Sillyshib To think one of them has HOPE as his surname. The irony is not lost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nick_Pye Believe it's happening. Thermometers do not tend to lie unlike our myopic populist politicians and the direction of travel for temperatures is only going one way. Record temperatures and rising climate instability across the globe tell their own story. Own the facts!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CharlieKate @bbcquestiontime @johnbirdswords Well said. It doesn't take much to find yourself out on the streets these days. If there's no safety net for its citizens when they need it then paying tax to any govt seems essentially pointless.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mgacramer @andypic @BorisJohnson He's got a solid 43-44% of the population behind him and that's all he needs. They will eventually see the monumental error of their ways when disastrous tory policies impact on them directly.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DavidAstbury7 @GNSensay @PaulHBeckwith Or possibly reading between the lines on all the hundreds of climate papers he's researched. The direction of travel is very clear and it's not a good one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@randombigbird Another tory that's not fit for purpose or government...just like the rest of the tory shambles. The UK seems determined to learn every lesson in the hardest way possible with the most useless govt in history at the helm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cash4questions2 @Bust3d00 @BryantOwain I'd start paying attention to the real world. You clearly inhabit your very own universe. Austerity never happened eh?? I suppose you think climate change is a myth and the earth is flat?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrianBirdieBhoy @KarenLWilkinson No. That makes sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KarenLWilkinson @yanic1965 Can't help but agree. This would skew all sporting competition. I have no truck with any gender issue but I would have hoped Laurel Hubbard would be intelligent enough to have thought about the repurcussions and legitimacy of competing in top level sport.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think today could well prove to be a date that goes down in history for a number of reasons.. #Syria #StockMarket #Heathrow #coronavirus ...landmark judgment for #ClimateEmergency but far too many other threats on the horizon to celebrate much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SueBarnish Aye...as clear as night follows day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheSuffolkMan It's been the plan all along..no intention of ever getting any kind of deal. This is a government reaching for ever new levels of incompetence, absurdity and wilful negligence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GNSensay @PaulHBeckwith You aint been looking hard enough Gerald!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SmoggyPower here's hoping you'll be celebrating with a cuppa around 10pm tonight ;-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GNSensay @PaulHBeckwith I suspect you should look into it a wee bit more. It's pretty clear to anyone that can process information that we are going the way of the dodo ..and fast. Thermometers do not tend to lie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nothing like a bit of spectacular Scottish scenery for getting life into context<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I mean the very least...THE VERY LEAST a govt should offer is improved #lifeexpectancy ...yet they are actually reducing it for the first time in a century. That fact alone should tell you everything you need to know about ten years of tory mis-rule.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mynameiskirk1 @SusanHarris80 @pickup8907 @DavidLammy Frankie nails it yet again...takes a squeedgie to that third eye! Genius!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"Utterly delusional" @Ianblackford_MP nails it when talking about tory immigration plans #PMQs. We are all being thrown into a collective dystopian tory delusion based on nowt but lies..really is time to think about bailing out eh?! Scotland is progress not regress #indyref2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Two months in and the bojo tories are being revealed as the utterly useless muppet show government we always knew it would be #PMQs ..they have nothing to offer anyone bar more poverty, distress and suffering . Their direction of travel is suicidal. Why can't everyone see that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Telegraph A national newspaper tweeting the same, undeniably false  lies as those made by so many tories. The UK is and always been an independent, sovereign nation. Check your geography books!! More like a toddlers comic book than a national newspaper. Pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SusanHarris80 @pickup8907 @DavidLammy Great stuff Susan...so now all brexit has to offer is "it'll be just like the post war years"....well what a bonus that will be eh?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pickup8907 @DavidLammy Do a bit more digging before posting the same detritus that tory politicians have been dumping on us for years Michelle. The Reagan/Thatcher economic model of the 80s paved the way for the credit crunch in 2008. Just think about context more ie a bit further down the rabbit hole<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The simple fact is (and history will be damning in its verdict) that the UK govt is not fit for purpose.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tennesseine @BorisJohnson Aye...economic suicide after a decade of the most irresponsible and incompetent government in UK history. Brexit is nothing but nonsense foisted on us by nonsensical idiots. It does - and always will - make zero sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jackson_Carlaw The problem Jackson is that your party is all about conserving and maintaining subservience to a union and parliament that's proven time and again to be operating against the best interests and wishes of the majority of Scots. There comes a breaking point.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NoRemainNoGain Precisely. A perfect storm. Co-operation and collective action will always outdo competition and isolationism. Tribes in trenches, backwardism, ostrichism never works...history proves it again and again...and we're now doing it at a critical point in time. Utter suicidal madness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>No shit Sherlock!! #flooding The head of the Environment Agency has warned against building new homes on the floodplain...  https://t.co/64UdHKud3N<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Magman55 @Jackson_Carlaw What's the problem? Both talented...and both have achieved a lot. Never quite understood the impact of making this comparison. It's a pretty sad, pointlessly low shot.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jackson_Carlaw The Tories have actually managed to reduce life expectancy for the first time in many decades. That is one hell of an achievement. Honestly Jackson what have the tories ever done for us?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ron_mould @Jackson_Carlaw Precisely what you get with tories..more of the same destructive policies, zero vision and competence. Beggars belief how any sane, rational human being can support anything this shower o shite boris mob does.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timolarch @JustJulz8 It's just government for the 44-45% of the UK population that voted for the nonsense brexit...the rest can just go to hell in a handcart as far as the tories are concerned. No other views count these days.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dianehain We do not have 50 years...you'd have expected Bill Gates to know that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Chunkyferryman @pjm56tw @DeborahFSussex @andrew_lilico Yes strange that no one ever explained before the referendum how one nation of 60m+ people was going to get similar or better trade deals than 28 nations of 500m+ people. Wonder why?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Tells you everything you'd ever want to know about the effects of #tory rule...they are not improving ANYTHING AT ALL, just making things worse..and they've not even started on their #brexit misadventure #lifeexpectancy  https://t.co/ZwWDf2XikR<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SueSuezep It aint going to get better any time soon either Sue. It's a perfect storm right now with the wilfully negligent tories in charge. Everything they've done since 2010 has got us into this tragic situation.  https://t.co/GCJC5uuRth<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Boris Johnson really has got #Brexit dung!  https://t.co/rSD5AYRhOA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FizzyBook @richbsys @David_Cameron @BorisJohnson Yep...Brexit was his vehicle (clown car) in order to get the top job. Now he realises he's in way too deep and surrounded by sad, pathetic poisoned minds. Whatever he does or doesn't do he will be recorded in history as a chancer, a charlatan and an empty vessel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnnieWellsMSP Nothing to offer Scotland other than a piece of paper I'm afraid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OorDavey @easyonthebrain Just like loving serfdom beyond words<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cescaraws And whether we actually have the time is open to debate, some say a decade (and there's plenty of data to justify that unfortunately) at best which should focus minds but retreating to tribes in trenches solves nothing. Common sense will have to prevail and soon or we are gone /3<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cescaraws It will soon be a case of ditching left right debate and going plain old fucking common sense if we are to survive as a species. Old systems will need tearing down, motivations will have to shift dramatically. Whether we can do that remains to be seen /2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cescaraws Excellent thread. Intelligent comments. Was always going to end up in Scotland but June 24 2016 made it more urgent for me. I felt England was lost on that day. A giant leap backwards. The right can never win but the left needs a new approach outside of the left right paradigm /1<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OxfordDiplomat To be fair it'll be a lot easier to get into North Korea than the UK this time next year<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RST1317 @theSNP It's gathering momentum. The longer the toxic tories are in power, the more it becomes a given. Scotland is on a totally different trajectory to England and independence will happen soon...compare current polling to 2014. Once over 60% by May/June call #indyref2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pickledpuffin It's the last flattulent gasps of power from the fat, greedy, white man knowing their time in the sun is coming to an end. No idea how they will explain their wrecklessness to their kids and grandkids when we hand them the broom to clear up our mess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pickledpuffin @mcguigandanny Absolutely Marion...this populist 'trend' is being funded by the fossil fuel companies. There's not a chance this trend can survive for any more than a few years before the weight of necessity bears down on it ...that's assuming we decide we'd quite like a future as a species.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TichbonBucks @DaveJH4 @UK_Resurgence Jeez mate...try watching it again but this time with the sound on!! You are a member of a party that has, bit by bit, abandoned any semblance of common sense or logic. It's a pitiful record of which you will be ashamed in a year or so.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That is the real tragedy here. So many lap up the nonsense that the EU is to blame when any logical, rational human being knows full well that ONLY the tories are to blame for this rabid shit show. It's monumentally sad that the UK has such an incredibly dumb, misinformed govt<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Brown666W @Jackson_Carlaw Yep...that's coming from the most inept and wilfully negligent govt in UK history. They do not have a leg to stand on with regard to any issue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@metimjohnston Me too Tim !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@metimjohnston It's going to be a big wake up call for these folks especially when they realise that their poisonous ideology can only ever go absolutely nowhere. They'll be in shock when the rebound from this 'era of stupid' is absolutely spectacular.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@northamrd @StandUp2Brexit @lunaperla @bbcquestiontime @AyoCaesar Brexit happened because of an incompetent, wilfully negligent government putting a polarising question to the UK population without a plan, a vision or any kind of detail.

<|startoftext|>@wordamentalist @Rampantredlion1 Clearly no education whatsoever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@g_gosden So sad, disappointing and depressing to see how far England has gone down the toilet bowl. It's been a rapid dissent and a path so far removed from common sense as to make this all feel like an Ealing comedy without the laughter.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dean1926 @LuffyxGon @BBCPolitics It's going to be a very very tough wake up call very soon for you Ernie. Guaranteed...and I think you know it. I wish you all the best. Take care of yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dean1926 @LuffyxGon @BBCPolitics With the most inept, incompetent, wilfully negligent govt in history?? No matter what your political filter you cannot deny that they have been shockingly poor. So what are you taking back control of precisely Ernie with this muppet show at the helm? I suspect you haven't a clue.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dean1926 @LuffyxGon @BBCPolitics You voted for a word Ernie...we all voted for or against a word. Shame it wasn't clearly defined beforehand and, to be fair, remains undefined. Don't you think that is wilful negligence on the part of those that called the referendum? Looks like stunningly dumb leadership to me!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@acgrayling @Mandoline_Blue The last vestiges of fairness and honour departed these shores around a decade ago. Since then almost every government decision has set us on a path to division and derision. It's been the most monumental negation of responsibility to its people by any UK govt in history.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Dean1926 @LuffyxGon @BBCPolitics When did you get a chance to vote for no deal? I missed that one Ernie...has there been another referendum? You might have "voted" for it but I'm 110% confident you'll not be backing it this time next year. Guaranteed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ablooty @randombigbird We are all being played for fools...by fools who are currently having their day in the sun. There's not a chance that these snake oil salesmen and women can win the argument and experience anything other than short term gain. It's impossible. Our worsening climate ensures that.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@VictorOlliver To be fair Victor Boris is nothing more than a blank canvas under the control of cummings et al, an empty vessel that's only afloat due to the ballast provided by cummings' and his puppet masters' abhorent views. The only concern of Boris is for himself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Otto_English Who'd have thunk it...he seemed oh so honest and believable just a couple of months ago lmao. Maybe just maybe the vacuous boris is sat in a posh hotel room contemplating resigning ...or, more likely, designing a new wine crate bus?! #WheresBoris<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SockFresh @Suecrag1 @SueSuezep Yep it is mate. Just imagine where we'd be if we'd listened to these folks two decades back...I doubt we'd be staring down the barrel of extinction had we taken them seriously.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SockFresh @Suecrag1 @SueSuezep I agree...just another diversionary tactic...but I do think unfortunately we will all soon find out that we wished we'd agreed with this magnificent lady a wee bit more!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeteWishart @mckcol The EU referendum was advisory...whatever happened to that nonsensical, self immolation project?! The lying tories just make it up as they go along. Always have done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@northumbrian_ @Chris08505199 @DavidLammy That's way too sensible an approach. You should be mindful of the fact that we no longer do 'sensible' in England but have instead decided to focus on the polar opposite.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davannwelsh @Bacchus_Baracus Yep...and England seems hell bent on learning lessons in the most painful way possible...maybe a nod to our "esteemed leader's"* experiences at Eton. * the twat called Boris<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@IBackBritain @BBCPolitics Introduce a uniform perhaps. Brown shirts haven't been in vogue for a while. What a sad, sorry shit show of a nation England has become.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@billy_bass_ Don't be scared...this can only ever be a temporary blip. The lunatics have assumed control of the assylum for a short while but the weight of necessity will render their loathesome inhumanity as little more than a footnote in history. The rebound will be spectacular.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IAmMardikins Pretti much everything this sorry, pathetic excuse for a govt (aka Cummings Inc) does makes the stomach turn. Since their first day in office in 2010 they've sufficiently brutalised us to the point where many just lap up their bullshit. They are a monumental disgrace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tara61711 @yanic1965 You have the chance to part of a unique experiment being shackled to a country that, for the first time in history, has made the conscious decision to self immolate, isolate and make itself poorer. Just think how much fun that suicidal adventure could be!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hmmm...suspect they haven't thought this thru but then that should surprise no one because this rotten to the core tory party never thinks anything thru. We are living in ridiculously perverse times #Immigration   https://t.co/nejV4qJDaj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnnaHanchard I predict you will be saying the exact opposite a year from now if bozo bojo continues with his wreckless ways...and I suspect you know it secretly. A tribes in trenches approach by any nation has never and will never work out well. It's not about politics..it's just common sense<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnnaHanchard The Hitler Club?? That bizarrely could be used far more aptly to describe our current direction of travel and government Anna. Wake up and realise no deal makes no sense whatsoever, is guaranteed 100% to fail and will make all of us significantly poorer! There will be no upside!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanStev91870878 @alexwickham @stevieinselby Thank you all for your RTs and likes...we all know folks who haven't yet woken up to the folly of this whole, nonsensical, self immolating project but one by one, perhaps silently,  they will realise that blinkered nationalism can never ever solve the existential issues we face.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RupertLowe10 Quite a lot of us are not looking forward to losing 'freedom of movement'...we really don't see it as a step forward in any way at all - you clearly do - so ideas like this need to be floated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juliefair @JohnRentoul Spot on. Never has been any intention of boris and his muppet show governmernt getting a deal out of this nonsense brexit farce. A year from now the chlorinated chickens will come home to roost...and within a few months the UK will be clamouring for a return to the EU.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JulietMEvans The sheer pace of this dissent into dystopia is surprising although the incredible stupidity of the English electorate is far from surprising. The writings been on the wall since the 2008/9 crash...maybe about time we learnt from the history books. Will we? Will we f**k!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrRemain No one ever explained precisely how one nation of 60 million will get better, or even comparable, trade deals than 28 nations representing 500 million people. It defies logic. Getting anywhere near what we had as an EU member is literally impossible. Economies of scale eh!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lsrlinda @SundayTimesScot @NicolaSturgeon Some people look outwards, others retreat to tribes in trenches at the precise time when we need exactly the opposite Linda. Why should the people of Scotland not have the right to be an independent nation after rejecting a nonsensical, myopic brexit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jackson_Carlaw Do you understand why so many Scots would like to live in an independent state Jackson when your party, over the past decade, has so effectively decimated public services? Wanting to control your own destiny is not a 'cult'...it's common sense, pure and simple.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@g_gosden Baby steps to goose steps. The direction of travel is startlingly clear and obvious and it aint pretty.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IanStev91870878 @alexwickham @stevieinselby This will go down in the history books as the most incompetent, divisive and destructive decade of governance in the history of the UK. We must all hope that Cummings Inc. (aka the govt) and populism everywhere will prove to be just a backwards blip or we're all toast.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@arcticlass Had enough of "SNP moral superiority"...so lets go for immorality eh...the kind of immoral nonsense foisted on all parts of the UK by a decade of tory incompetence and austerity. Your lot broke it but there's FA chance you'll be cleaning it up in Scotland #indyref2 #toriesout<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Jackson_Carlaw Now how do you make "lets have more of the same destructive governance, ever more democratic deficit and inequality" sound sexy and an attractive proposition to younger voters. Tough one that..but good luck with it. Or perhaps not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Angela68060318 Doesn't matter too much Angela because those friendly tories are lowering life expectancy too..more rapidly than at any time since WW2 so there probably won't be too much to worry about!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Absolutely. Scotland is on a different trajectory, rejecting isolationism and tribes in trenches and creating its own progressive, sustainable and outward looking vision. England I'm afraid has chosen a wholly different route and it's far from progressive or visionary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haggis_UK A pitiful bunch of talentless mouthpieces for cummings et al inc that's now running the show. Already creating enemies, they are nothing but trumpian populists having their day in the sun. The weight of necessity will insure these imbeciles are derided in the history books.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulJColvin More of the same shit won't cut it with anyone so maybe throw in a fancy, fairytale bridge to Ireland and some ropey cinema ads and he'll stem the flow of Scots to Yes....my arse. It will backfire spectacularly; the tories that is, not my arse<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulJColvin It's a pretty damn successful 'evangelical faith based cult' then Jackson...they clearly have something good to offer and considerably more than that offered by Scottish tories. Talking of which, what benefits do your tory party offer Scotland exactly?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ochaye6dot5 He's just a short term aberration. History will not treat him or his tory shower o' shite kindly. The empty vessal that is boris is his stooge but I'm fairly sure Cummings is a stooge himself, beholden to secretive powers from across the pond. All will become clear in time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@80_mcswan YES ASAP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The trouble with #populism @BenjaminMoffitt is that it will only ever be a short term glitch in the road of progress. The weight of necessity imposed by #ClimateChange will ensure it will go down in history as a short-lived reactionary aberration  https://t.co/SOtpdKjQTK<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jneill Sadly yes. The mainstream media very rarely reports the gravity of the situation. The tipping points have tipped and the rate of temperature rise is alarming.

<|startoftext|>@KingOwenR @COP26 @ConnectSDGs @vanessa_vash @UNFCCC @SDGaction @UNDPClimate @AfricaCRP @Strike4Youth Great post, great work Owen but we won't have 16 generations unfortunately.

Only when we accept that, will we be able to truly deal with these issues and change our trajectory.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Record spikes in temperature across the globe in January... yet we have a #POTUS in #Trump unable to see the reality of this and a growing, seeping isolationism that only exacerbates the issue. A totally nonsensical world right now.  https://t.co/Yy6oGoVBXl #ClimateEmergencyNow<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Ironic that we seem to have an anarchist in charge of a #tory government. #BorisJohnson is merely an empty useless vessel, a mouthpiece and blank canvas for whatever moves #cummings desires #reshuffle...taking back control eh??!! The irony is not lost!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The wheels coming off the bumbling #boris bus already mimicing his nonsensical trumpian inspiration.

<|startoftext|>@pickledpuffin Yep..strange comment...John Simpson of all people should know that every seismic political action has an equal and opposite reaction &amp; actions are getting ever more seismic although the issues at play in Ireland seem to be based around social wellbeing rather than self immolation<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DalbidEU @g_gosden What amazes me is that no one bothered to consult geography books or look into the United Nations to discover that...surprise surprise...the UK has always been sovereign and independent.

<|startoftext|>@hotelalphabet @Michael57930798 @iaintheeuropean The current trajectory is a nailed on no deal.

<|startoftext|>@mikec6mjc @CharlotteCGill @twtpolitics1001 And that is precisely the approach that will only ever foster more division eh Mike?? If the tories get their way this whole pathetic, nonsensical project will leave us all as losers!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Haggis_UK @ron_mould Childish words and actions by our useless tory politicians are now the new normal.

<|startoftext|>Aside of not believing a single word this muppet show of a westminster government says, can't help thinking this is nothing but a self-defeating, suicidal approach for the UK negotiating with our closest partners.

<|startoftext|>@Beany_1 @mraleuphemism It's just one lie after another after another for the UK's muppet clown prince.

<|startoftext|>@GeorgeMasonsGh1 @Veldpark @KTHopkins @realDonaldTrump Does seem a wee bit inconsequential don't you think though..in light of the potential for global conflagration and the massive threat of #ClimateEmergency ...maybe just maybe we should be working closer together than ever rather than reverting to tribes in trenches eh?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KTHopkins @realDonaldTrump What would be your response if #Iran had assassinated our second in command?

<|startoftext|>@KTHopkins ALL epochs end with clowns and we have quite a few right now.

<|startoftext|>@cescaraws Isolationism and populism...brexit and trump will sooner or later collapse and become irrelevant under the weight of necessity #ClimateEmergency<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Just donated a tenner to @Wikipedia ...It's an important resource and if we want to retain any vestige of truth or objectivity in these 'interesting' times then folks should support it if they can<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ExStrategist @bbclaurak I suspect the same will be said for those who voted for brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClimateBen Nope...because media is intrinsically bound up with capitalism ie they have to make money. Getting the real facts in front of folks is nigh on impossible without social media<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Simon_Long Any time you see the Mail or Express on newsstands just discretely cover it with another, less regressive, newspaper or publication. A tiny act of rebellion but done in the best interests of those poor folk who subject themselves to such bile.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Stephen16031962 It's simply obscene...that we still have folks earning more money in a year than hundreds will earn in a lifetime pretty much says it all.

<|startoftext|>@fedupwithtories Strange that all of the interviews with boris voters I've seen in new northern tory seats reveal their desire for a better NHS, better education, better transport and better life chances. Not a chance with this mob running the UK. The irony is not lost.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DeborahHTalbot @DemocracyStolen As expected the duplicitous lying turd that is Boris starts his slow waltz towards destructive totalitarianism.

<|startoftext|>Voters in England will realise very soon quite how incompetent and destructive a party and PM they've voted in. That will become crystal clear within months.

<|startoftext|>@Davidoug22David I have no thesaurus ...piles were sorted a long time ago! I don't think you can argue with the fact that Scotland and England think substantially differently on issues like brexit...which has been the catalyst for all of this division across the UK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@virgosam70 Cognitive dissonance at work. Just double down on dumb if you don't get what you want...and we can all guarantee that none of us will get what we want other than a self serving elite seeking to increase their wealth.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Davidoug22David Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. The politics of England is heading in a tangentally opposite direction to Scotland. One is about isolation and regress, the other clearly looking outward and progressive. Those two directions of travel cannot work together.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@virgosam70 Just on the most simple level I ask how the hell does one nation get better trade deals than 28 acting together? No one ever answers. Do folks not understand the term 'economies of scale'? Counterintuitive nonsense to think that anything at all will be better with brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@virgosam70 I do wonder what these folks will make of #brexit when they experience the consequences. Absolutely no upside whatsoever in sight but so many still stick to their guns. It will be a very nasty shock I suspect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Davidoug22David Yep and the best liar always gets the top job at Westminster eh?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Davidoug22David Most probably because she is the best politician by a distance.

<|startoftext|>No doubt @NicolaSturgeon is spot on..this is not a party political issue. To play politics with such an existential crisis is to write our collective obituary.

<|startoftext|>@builderhire @jai_dub The most depressing aspect, as proved by the likely Boris no show on #Channel4News #ClimateEmergency debate, is that they propose nothing to deal with it.

<|startoftext|>@builderhire @jai_dub It is tragic. The tories are beyond contemp.

<|startoftext|>@jasonsd1970 @gt2andy @rzeta0 @TheEconomist The UK finances before the banks were bailed out in virtually every country on the planet were roughly the same as the Tories.

<|startoftext|>@jasonsd1970 @gt2andy @rzeta0 @TheEconomist All you have done is believe tory guff ...probably because labour have been so completely pathetic at dealing with that question!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jasonsd1970 @gt2andy @rzeta0 @TheEconomist Hmmm...I think we all know what caused that in virtually every nation on the planet..greedy bankers in the US.

<|startoftext|>@belle_esq @spaceangel1964 Bottom line is whatever folks' views on #Corbyn, the #ClimateEmergency will necessitate far greater state intervention and co-operation globally very very soon if we are to have a future as a species.

<|startoftext|>@JuGarJo @dandrew919 @spaceangel1964 Their strategy following a no deal, which it surely will be at the end of january, is to wing it, cross their fingers and legs and hope it doesn't go to shit too soon.

<|startoftext|>@spaceangel1964 I have no idea. It's tragic, depressing and pathetic.

<|startoftext|>@GaryGibbonBlog @Channel4News  You have to tackle the nature of money head on and ask yourself if our attachment to it will lead to anything other than oblivion. If you ignore this you ignore the flattulent elephant in the room. Look outside of the box and you'll find answers.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Now start drilling down and analysing the brilliant ideas that are out there @GaryGibbonBlog to replace #capitalism. It's been patently obvious since 2008 that this system is not fit 4 purpose and has no chance of facing down  #ClimateEmergency. Dramatic systemic change needed!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Finally...well done @Channel4News for featuring the crisis of #capitalism...now dig deeper and look at the real practical options that might help us survive as a species. There are some amazing ideas out there..give them the oxygen of publicity! #RBE #TVP #TZM<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Sika_dm To be fair it's what we've come to expect from #tories... dishonesty, incompetence and wilful negligence in equal measure.

<|startoftext|>@MBallantyneMSP To be fair Michelle please compare and contrast with the "achievements" of your #tories in government. It's quite simply abysmal.

<|startoftext|>@TripleNcoffee @trippytwin @stevewhiteraven Absolutely. I'm no apologist for Corbyn but I would say that racist is the very last word you'd use to describe him... just common sense based on his politics so there's a more sinister agenda at play here.

<|startoftext|>So how exactly has #BorisJohnson changed his #brexit deal in the last few days...according to #Farage?? @BBCNews ..it looks like we are all getting stitched up a kipper by these two lying snake oil shifters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Unionbuster Four times losers?? We all fucking lost John and we look all set to lose a shed load more<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@80_mcswan Scotland is a distinct, unique nation with its own strong culture, moral nature and sense of identity. It is clearly heading in an opposite trajectory to its union neighbour. There is nothing to fear by being an independent nation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Unionbuster As opposed to the tories who decimate public services, needlessly divide the UK population with a nonsense referenDUM, double national debt and continue to display wilful negligence and disdain for every single one of us. Wake up and smell the coffee John. Don't be an idiot!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The tories make an art out of combining incompetence and duplicitousness...so #BorisJohnson ..customs border in the Irish Sea or not based on your deal...or are you 'softening' us up for your precious 'default' no deal? Incompetence or lying?...most likely both<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CPFlo It is tragic. Money might make the world go round but it will also make it uninhabitable.

<|startoftext|>@jonnywoo34 No one is up to that job...far too challenging. Far easier to just accept that everything the #tories utter is complete bullshit. I have no idea why so many cannot see thru their ineptitude and sheer destructiveness. They are the definition of anti government<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SmoggyPower Nine years of doing the precise opposite of what any responsible government should be doing. Divided us, decimated public services...the disgraceful #Conservatives have achieved nothing and will continue to screw us all. It really is time to wake up to their wilful negligence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@davidwatmough19 I'm sure Doris will be going for a no deal, despite his recent EU agreement, making trade deal negotiations a lot more complicated. We have a government that is so inept, so incompetent as to be almost laughable were it not so important<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The only way we will mitigate the #climateemergency is through a wholesale philosophical and economic shift from competition to co-operation. The profit motive does not fit with saving the planet. Amazing ideas are out there but no interest in our future from mainstream media.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fragmansixty9 The truth is it's impossible for the current economic model - with money and profit as the sole motivation - to deal with the climate emergency. Money will always be more important than having a planet to live on unless... #RBE #TZM #TVP @moneyfreeparty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MartinShovel Aided and assisted by an army of fuckwits willing to vote for more of the same shit we've been subjected to for 9 years. Is it possible for any govt anywhere to be quite so incompetent and wilfully negligent as this shower o shite?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Redpeter99 Mark Francois perhaps? Like peas out of the same rotten pod<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ArgyleLoz Proof that life expectancy has got better - sorry I mean shorter - under the Tories. First govt in decades to achieve shortening our time on this planet. I hope they are so very proud of this.   https://t.co/5uvPF9otN1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@80_mcswan Not until we've got a completely new set of politicians with effective hearing aids. All the existing mob will do is preserve the status quo and cement our direction of travel towards extinction. Money remains more important than human survival. We all need to change.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@80_mcswan @Coigach1 The Scottish govt clearly acts in the interests of its people. Compare and contrast with what the tories have delivered over the past 9 years by decimating public services. Might as well be on a different planet. That is why Scotland needs to chart its own course #indyref2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pickledpuffin Sure would Marion...I believe that Doris will partner up with the brexit party in the next few weeks and ditch his diversionary, illusory deal and return to his ridiculous default of no deal. Vote for anybody but the Tories! They're the opposite of what a responsible govt shud be<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bazfor I personally don't care other than a yellowash in Scotland...I just look at the tories and cannot for the life of me work out how they are in power. They've done nothing but divide us and decimate public services for 9 years. No idea why folks vote for them!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This is what the #tories are good for....absolutely nothing, diddley squat. Lies, broken promises and more lies from a govt that's worked AGAINST its people for 9 years. #GE2019 #GeneralElection2019 #SNP #Labour #Libdems   https://t.co/F4IQbfCfrk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KenKenph59 What is so perplexing is that there are still human beings out there - and lots of them - that will still consider voting for them. Food banks, universal credit, brutal cuts, homelessness etc etc ..the UK has gone to shit under their governance. That shud be the issue in this GE!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KenKenph59 It's what happens Ken when you have such a pitifully thought out referendum with no plan let alone any definition of what brexit means..just 17.4 million different emotional attachments to an 'idea' - it just smacks of wilful negligence and wrecklessness by the tories<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Easy to understand and see thru.. Boris will have to revert to his preferred no deal position b4 GE by partnering with garage's light blue rinse brigade or his party is finished in government. His EU deal was always going to be a sham #Brexit. Duplicitous divisive tories as ever<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rachel_rj6 @DaveTuffnell Nine years and they've achieved NOTHING, nowt, zilch other than pointless division, increased poverty and inequality and decimated public services. That is their legacy...but every chance England will vote this bag of billy bollocks party in again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Best of luck to the Brexit Party...here's hoping they stand in every seat in England ...it would deliver the perfect result for everyone in the UK ;-)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bazfor It all boils down to just personal opinions moulded by nature and nurture. As our experiences coalesce, so does our collective nature. With #climateemergency we will all need to change profoundly. Brexit will be a mere comma in history in comparison.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MarkInTheCosmos Duplicitous Boris knows exactly what he's doing with this fake deal that has no chance of passing the HoC.

<|startoftext|>@BorisJohnson Playing us all for fools!! Your token attempt to get a deal is done with the full awareness that the HoC will reject it and you can return to your default position of no deal with no time for the Benn Act to apply. So so so transparent #brexit #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RaySmit09853147 @g_gosden @DanielBarrs2 And that Ray has been the issue from day one...had the UK's PM immediately consulted and worked across party lines to formulate a plan then we might not be in this shitcom right now.

<|startoftext|>You carry on fooling, lying and hoodwinking your 40% of deluded and soon to be embarrassed tory and BP voters #BorisJohnson..the rest of us will carry on seeing through every last bit of bullshit that you and your useless, numpty government come out with #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RSSkeptic @KenKenph59 @davidwatmough19 It only ever existed on the side of a bus. The only other dividend will be in the bank accounts of hedge fund managers a few days after a no deal<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brexit has been a tory owned nonsense from day one. No plan, no definition and absolutely no vision for something that will clearly make all of us poorer for years to come. There simply are not any advantages from leaving the EU at all and we all know it #Merkel #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@earth_mummy @Lynn_GT @Conservatives @BorisJohnson Yep...write all of the benefits on the back of a stamp in thick marker pen and hey presto...every home can be posted the impressively invisible advantages of brexit.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lynn_GT Spot on Lynn...why is this not crystal clear for everyone or has cognitive dissonance infected England?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScotBrit2014 @TrueScotland @NicolaSturgeon @theSNP The UK was and always has been an independent, sovereign state within the EU. Why would it be any different for an independent Scotland in the EU? It's a choice between one union that wants you and one union that fails continually to listen to you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@timolarch When you have an incompetent, clueless government you get an incompetent, clueless electorate (in England) unfortunately. Anyone mad enough to believe in a no deal is just exhibiting faux pride before a fall<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jcvivian14 @ResistersLondon Definitely no lol<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's not difficult to come to the conclusion that we are past the point of no return and if there's still any #climatedenial folks out there, please use your heads and take in the facts. These figures do not lie. Without our habitat we have nothing, we are nothing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bazfor Most of my head knows you are right..but a wee part of it retains a small amount of faith in our collective global will but the current zeitgeist has us reverting to tribes in trenches which never ever works.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Fracking and smacking...#Scotland shows the way forward once again<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bazfor Whether the engine worked or not the story got noticed...and got coverage. I don't know your views on #ClimateEmergency but if you drill down into the facts you come to one conclusion. We are essentially fucked as a species. Isolationism in any form will not help remedy that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>You've got to drill down deep for the real answers. We're on a suicide trajectory as a species and we all know it. The only route to survival is wholesale change in all of us away from a system that habitually denies us the truth. The answers are out there #ClimateEmergency<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ResistersLondon It's the start of a new pact by #Hungary and the UK to break out of the EU and form a new union of states in Europe that they could call, for the sake of argument, the European Union where they work together to share best practice, raise standards and secure peace for decades.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@soliteire Yep has been from day one of the #BenitoBoris dictatorship. His religion is no deal...far too much to lose for his hedge fund friends if not.

<|startoftext|>@FBJeffers0n The only route to the survival of our species involves a massive shift in thinking by all of us to a far more co-operative, collective model of economics where money is obsolete. We are as far from that with #trump as it's possible to be..and we are ALL staring down the barrel.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FBJeffers0n The climate is already collapsing...in real time in front of our eyes. The economy collapsed in 2008 and is still on life support given debt levels.

<|startoftext|>@Bazfor Yep...you sure did...must have heard 10 or more different brexit scenarios from leave voters. It was as clear as very thick shitty mud Barry..that was the case on June 24 2016 and is still the case. The whole thing has been bonkers and nonsense from day one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonathon793793 @SueBarnish The Tories should never ever be allowed near the reigns of power again...however unfortunately there's a very slim majority of the English electorate who suffer from cognitive dissonance.

<|startoftext|>@Bazfor Best to have a referendum when you've defined what Brexit actually means, have formulated a plan and delivered a vision for the future perhaps Barry don't you think? It might have got more than half of us behind it. Total and utter incompetence from the outset by the tories.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bazfor I'm sure we will all be in total agreement by December Barry. Collective experience tends to do that whatever folks voted for over a thousand days ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SueBarnish Absolutely no doubt that @patel4witham and her fellow criminal tories WILL end up behind bars in due course for the needless division and wilful negligence they have foisted on us in recent years. They are as low as it's possible to go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jonathon793793 @SueBarnish Only the lobotomised could vote for this dire shitshow of a government. Nine years in power and they have achieved precisely fucking nothing other than dividing us irrevocably.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bazfor Yep...time will reveal all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bazfor If I ever get lobotomized Barry I promise to give it some serious consideration. I suspect you'll get the no deal you want but I guarantee you'll disown it within weeks !!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Cloud cuckoo land ...#BorisJohnson has no intention of getting a #brexit deal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulDuxbury Tories don't do 'responsible'. Nine years of wilful negligence, shocking judgment and downright incompetence proves that. The first thing that should have happened after such a pitifully planned vote - seek cross party consensus on how to deliver brexit - never happened.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KirstenDE999 @paulkrugman True. One question I've yet to ever receive an answer to from #Brexit voters is how exactly does one nation acting in isolation get better trade deals than 28 acting together? Any one...please??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RMillross @OptoSean Whatever happens Scotland is travelling in a completely different direction to England right now so we all know what is inevitable but cutting yourself adrift at such a critical point doesn't seem that wise. But I might be wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RMillross @OptoSean Do you really really believe anything this govt spouts...seriously?? Being a student of politics you should know from history that tribes in trenches always gets us precisely nowhere. We will all be in agreement soon I'm sure kid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RMillross @OptoSean Don't read the guardian don't watch sky..was just referencing operation yellowhammer which is the govts own planning. Being a Tory govt it must clearly be bullshit then?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RMillross @OptoSean Nope...just wait until the supermarket shelves are empty and medications are not available...that's when to riot. That's a proper justification to riot...when your survival is on the line. You won't have to wait long I'm sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@rapsiencyn Just doubling down on dumb... give them their precious unicorny no deal..and then give it a few months. No one will admit to voting leave by then<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bryonyvk That's been the issue from day one. Too many deluded into thinking this is easy. No definition, no plan and no vision beforehand and still no idea on how to leave other than battering down the doors with a destructive no deal.

<|startoftext|>@cassandrasprod1 @CharlotteCGill I dont recall any marches or demonstrations against the EU before this bonkers #brexit. I do recall many marches and demonstrations against the tories though. I wonder who is to blame for the UK's ills???!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meljomur But both England and Scotland represent strong identities and voices in the world. We will always be close and strong neighbours and partners but imho Scotland is going in an opposite trajectory, a far more positive, logical one given the state of the world. Indy inevitable.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meljomur Unjustified deference I should have added...a deference enshrined in visible traditions and a fear of anything that upsets the apple cart which perversely no deal brexit achieves. Many sadly know little about the EU, less still its common sense and positive impact on us daily.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meljomur What is confusing is that in the light of so much negative info about a no deal brexit, so many leave voters still chose that route. Most know they'll come a cropper when the SHTF but seem to relish it. There's also deference to establishment which is less so in Scotland imho<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@meljomur Very good question! Scotland has a distinct and unique culture that seems to look outward, is progressive and absorbs change more easily whereas far too many folks in England hark back to the past, have a sense of entitlement and shun change (hence the name conservatives) imho<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OccuWorld @LeeCamp Yep...I see it as a prison of fear within a prison of ego. When you realise there's nothing to fear you've unlocked that door.

<|startoftext|>@OccuWorld @LeeCamp We need to escape the two prisons of fear and ego if we are to have the chance of survival as a species.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OccuWorld @LeeCamp Bob on! 'Human nature' has never been fixed...it's moulded by the system in which it exists. I doubt we will ever wake up but there are some amazing, visionary ideas out there that need to be debated and turned mainstream or we are toast. Simple as!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@OccuWorld @LeeCamp Maybe time to accept that humans are just not good at joined up thinking. We can't see the bigger picture which is slowly extinguishing us. Maybe time to let the algorhythms rule in the interests of serving every human being on this glorious planet<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MollieW152 @markydeedrop @BorisJohnson Absolutely. Therefore the only solution is..... ???<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MollieW152 @markydeedrop @BorisJohnson The question asked was therefore deeply flawed Mollie. Only one place to lay blame. The Tories. If you have a referendum without any idea how to deliver it, it might be best to go back to the drawing board.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FordySpurs @BorisJohnson @Nigel_Farage Divide and divide again. Then divide some more. Not going to end up well is it Martin?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markydeedrop @MollieW152 @BorisJohnson But that's what happens when you needlessly divide a nation down the middle with a badly thought out referendum with no plan and no vision. A chasm opens up, it just gets wider and you end up with a choice between far right and left. Easy to understand..somewhat harder 2 solve<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Message to future England...have a referendum when you have a plan! That lack of vision, planning and foresight on the part of those who wanted a referendum explains exactly why we are where we are. Wilful negligence by tories from start to finish #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@reble263 @BorisJohnson Baby steps to goose steps. When democracy goes on holiday in walks despotism to fill the gap. Be careful what you wish for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@northumbrian_ @Chelsea_star_10 @beccijohnson88 I get your points...reasoned debate. It's the vast chasm that's opened up between us all though. That could have been avoided with just a little bit of planning beforehand but we don't seem to do detail very well whereas our European cousins do so most definitively.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@northumbrian_ @Chelsea_star_10 @beccijohnson88 Maybe if there had been a plan, a vision of how leaving the EU would be better it would have garnered the support of more than one in two of the electorate. I've no beef with the EU, far from perfect but considerably better than toxic useless incompetent tories<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@northumbrian_ @Chelsea_star_10 @beccijohnson88 lies full squarely with the tories. They have presided over austerity for the past 9 years creating the perfect conditions for a leave vote. The tories are the ones to blame for the UK's ills and the UK will dissolve as a result of their wilfully negligent actions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@northumbrian_ @Chelsea_star_10 @beccijohnson88 My issue from the start is that the referendum was so badly thought out as to be farcical. No definition even of what brexit meant, no plan anywhere in sight and it was nothing more than an exercise to lance a tory boil. I look at the problems in the UK right now and the fault...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@northumbrian_ @Chelsea_star_10 @beccijohnson88 And what if it is a catastrophe?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BettGunther @metpoliceuk @michaelgove @BorisJohnson I'm not sure...looked like they've been on high grade skunk to me! ;-) You must have missed the bit when Dominos delivered a pepperoni pizza halfway through the session!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TyrellCorp_ @80_mcswan The real key is getting over that 60% threshold...as we all know a 52/48 split will solve nothing but the tories are doing most of the groundwork with their shambolic governance. I've no doubt that undecided Scots will see sense.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@northumbrian_ @Chelsea_star_10 @beccijohnson88 What happened to make you anti EU? I can fully understand why someone would cross from leave to remain but why the other way given the overwhelming weight of evidence? What aspects of being out of the EU with a no deal will directly improve our day to day lives?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@northumbrian_ @Chelsea_star_10 @beccijohnson88 If the date is set for before no deal then great but bojo is a twisty turd who is only able to lie and lie and lie. Nothing that comes from this man is to believed. I'm sure as an informed voter you recognise that!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@northumbrian_ @Chelsea_star_10 @beccijohnson88 No one is terrified of a GE ...it's about when it happens not if it happens. Timing is everything and if it's in week one of a no deal as bojo wants then it's a coup d'etat.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ORLYSheepboy Well your own personal free lorry load of brexit cash will be leaving the EU for the UK in November 2019 so best to allow a bit more time. Say April 1st 2048 as a rough guide.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SharzaDethick Here's hoping ;-)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@bindon @mikegalsworthy Don't worry..it's bonfire night five days later. Might be a good chance to warm ourselves and cook any rodents we might have found<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FamilyTreeFairy @NJamesWorld So nobody knows what future awaits us with a no deal? That's positive eh? I wonder how many specifically voted for a no deal? Best to have a plan and a definition before we ever have another referendum because neither currently exist three years on.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@katielfrank Clearly you've been hanging around the wrong areas. Not once have I experienced any anti English sentiment in Scotland<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WojtusciszynP @StillYesScot @NicolaSturgeon How would you feel if your nation voted by a distance to not leave the EU and then you found yourself being taken out of the EU by your neighbouring nation?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brawday @beachmonkey7676 To be fair NS is by a country mile the best political leader in the UK. Compare her integrity and honesty to...any tory MP you chose. Streets ahead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FamilyTreeFairy @NJamesWorld How long is temporary? And how will our politicians end  the worst rammifications of a no deal? What's the plan? Still not seen anything that suggests this govt has the capability of making no deal anything other than a catastrophe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@spaceangel1964 It's just the trump show all over again...chaos, division and then more chaos, more division.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Garf0412 @MPIainDS @BBCNews @BBCPolitics Well you must have watched it...it's common practice in journalism to get the views of both sides as the BBC did with this. It's called objectivity.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@montaillacman @ElliotElinor @BettGunther It's nigel garage and his light blue ukip brigade in coalition with boris...at which point any sane, rational unlobotimised human being will have made plans to get out pronto<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@montaillacman @ElliotElinor @BettGunther If, as we expect, no deal is an utter catastrophe then johnson will not survive anywhere near a full term with such a febrile electorate. After that Labour is all but inevitable. Scotland will get independence thru a lab/snp pact..or....<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ElliotElinor @BettGunther If its a GE in early November just after a no deal and before any of the serious rammifications then they could win a majority for a short while. Any later and both parties will be toast with zero credibility. Timing is everything for boris and his cabale of numpties.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@oh_by_Jingo67 It's clear that the Boris muppet show is doing the best possible PR for #indyref2, strengthening the case with every passing day, every pronouncement however an independent Scotland may well need a labour govt south of the border to ease out any initial issues. Just a view!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Definitely the best news story of the day!! #veganism   https://t.co/0vQXYVHEuH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brawday Tory leaflets always double up as very strong and stable toilet paper aptly reflecting its message and copy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SimonUbsdell @mrgeoffatkins A good appraisal. This also makes some sense albeit simplistically. When the balance of power shifts too much in one direction you get what we currently have...a harbinger of chaos.  https://t.co/nhIqFBAuK5<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@juiceianturner @SimonUbsdell Maybe that's just how the human race is programmed..a third look outward...a third look backward and the remaining third are watching Love Island. A right brain / left brain dichotomy which, when not in balance, creates chaos as we r seeing. Wish I'd studied this back in the day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NatWorldPhoto @SimonUbsdell @follicles Very well put. We live in an era of cognitive dissonance. Just double down on dumb until you can go no further down the toilet bowl. And you're right..we all do it from time to time. The wake up eureka moment can be both enlightening and humbling.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cescaraws @PeterArnottGlas @TartanTories @HTScotPol @BorisJohnson There just seems to be a hell of a lot more common sense in Scotland..an ability to not shroud thinking in xenophobia,  myopia and delusions of grandeur. A wee bit wiser!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MRobRist That's a mighty fine grown up approach you have there Mr Silver but then you deny climate change so hardly surprising. Clearly all thermometers are spreading fake news? And 17 million versus the rest?? Might not go the way you desire I suspect.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FBJeffers0n If #Brexit has achieved anything at all it's revealed quite how uneducated and ill informed so many of our fellow citizens are. I do wonder how many of them will react to the no deal chaos.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@derekjames150 @triciamayne @AmberRuddHR Just an amber dudd whose views bend with the wind..a bit like @MattHancock @michaelgove @sajidjavid et al whose belief in avoiding a no deal appears to have turned full circle in just a few weeks. I'm sure they all have their own personal exit strategies worked out though.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@username8885 We were almost at that point in 2008..minutes away from a dominoes style collapse of the banks with ATMs closed and accounts expunged. At that point you cease all ties with your state, look after your own survival and start on building a true resource based economy #RBE #TZM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sajidjavid I'd get out of this toxic hornets nest as soon as you can Mr Javid before you get stung badly. If you have any integrity at all you should quit now and at least retain a wee measure of respect from the UK electorate..if not the next couple of months will finish you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JJHTweets @RossSin41002052 @michaelgove Yet another Tory lie. At what point will they actually tell the truth about anything at all eh? At what point do the people of the UK get told honestly what's coming down the tracks @michaelgove ??<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@PeteAldridge4 What's the plan Pete to end no deal chaos and how long will it last? Do you honestly think the current tory shower have any kind of plan at all other than trying to mitigate the disruptions. It would be good to have just a touch of clarity on this if you could provide it?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alandoh90773863 @lewis_goodall We do clearly still believe in kings and queens and fairytales despite the fact it's 2019 and we should know better. We must be addicted to servitude but there will be no happy ending to this story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrfgrimes1 @hopeoverfear01 @johnleremainer I think it will return to its true motherland in the very near future. Kind of inevitable with these tory charlatans at the helm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alandoh90773863 @lewis_goodall The queen...our unelected head of state but we like to be selective when it comes to democracy. Should she be pressured into stopping anti no deal legislation then she will have written the last chapter in the history of the UK royal family.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"At the moment nothing credible has come from the British government" @simoncoveney ...don't hold your breath Simon...a tory government won't ever do credibility...just self serving expediency and wilful negligence #backstop #Ireland<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@alandoh90773863 @lewis_goodall Faux pride and cognitive dissonance will stop them from seeing the error of their ways. They'll double down on dumb until they are directly impacted negatively. Zero vision, zero substance and zero wisdom from the architects of this chaos<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheDafferz @hopeoverfear01 Ego will always consume charlatans<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alandoh90773863 @lewis_goodall The question is how will the electorate respond when they realise they've been sold a defecating pup? Will the leavers blame the remainers, the EU or the real conmen behind this shambles? Who knows..some might even wake up...hope springs eternal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alandoh90773863 @lewis_goodall Well hopefully just until November but the incredible myopic stupidity of the English electorate will never cease to surprise<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lewis_goodall The big questions are how long will the no deal chaos last...and how the hell long will it take this incredibly incompetent tory cabale get us out of it? It would be so nice to see a plan but there will never be one. Just make it up as they go along. They need ousting..and soon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lewis_goodall But..but...but...they have a plan now Lewis...good old Yellowhammer that might save us all from armageddon...in the first few days after a no deal with a bit of martial law chucked in for good measure. Wilfully negligent governance on an epic scale from start to finish.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Astonishing how easily and quickly tories change their mind on #Prorogation @MattHancock @sajidjavid @NickyMorgan01 @AmberRuddHR etc...just a shame the people of the UK aren't allowed to change their mind.

<|startoftext|>@Iain643 @RayVersionTwo Outstanding riposte!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cescaraws @allisonpearson @McavoyHilary Just remember she writes for the telegraph so can't write what she really thinks. I'm sure all that eager anticipation for a November 1st no deal will have dissipated within weeks. I wonder what they'll write then?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cescaraws @allisonpearson @McavoyHilary There's been no vision whatsoever...just platitudes and rhetoric aimed at satisfying self serving charlatans. Maybe it's some big secret and the glistening unicorns will be set free on November 1st? The world has moved on since the mid 1970s..just a shame folks' minds have not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MattHancock Maybe she had an issue with #Prorogation ..like you had a few weeks ago.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cescaraws @allisonpearson @McavoyHilary The silence will be deafening as per usual. No vision, no plan just the vaguest, misty eyed recollections of a time that never existed. Give it a few weeks of a no deal and we'll all be singing from the same hymn sheet.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gregjdawson And within a few months there would be demonstrations and outrage at Americans 'coming over and taking our jobs'.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@5StarChaffSplat I think you may well have just boosted republicanism my friend. Well done! So why is it you still believe in fairytales and princesses??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SueBarnish @realDonaldTrump Trump, Johnson et al are just the last flattulent gasps of the stupid fat greedy white man who knows his time is up. His power and influence is on the wane, he's outnumbered, cornered and he's determined go out with a bang. They are there to laugh at. Bread and circuses.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigbenn1e @stephenkerrMP Aye...a few last nights in some decent hotels...and then the game is up for each and every tory MP in Scotland. It'll be a long, long time before their wilfully negligent party is allowed anywhere near the reigns of power.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeterArnottGlas That would prove to be an intriguing addition to the  Edinburgh tourist trail ;-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GREIGE24150190 @daTARTANSPARTAN Wise move. What's coming down the track will not be good for god knows how long. The longer it goes on, the more inevitable independence becomes. I'd ensure you stock up with a decent bottle of single malt to celebrate that day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HelDoc369 No so much Balmoral as immoral. From a young age I've struggled to work out why we have a royal family and a queen..maybe just a collective insecurity and desire for deference and servitude but really in 2019...princes and princesses ffs.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Femi_Sorry Just baby steps to goose steps<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigbenn1e Every chance it could be a full house with the way things are going in Westminster...that would send a clear message that independence from this dead duck government is a given.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CelticOracle1 @BBCVickiYoung Let time define who the super idiot is. It will all become clear in due course.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CelticOracle1 @BBCVickiYoung I'm sorry but if you have to bypass democracy to deliver this ultimate act of self immolation then you have lost every argument going on democracy. No sane human being voted for what's to come with a no deal. It's babysteps to goose steps ...but maybe that suits your objective?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CelticOracle1 @BBCVickiYoung Antidemocratic? How so? Did you vote for a no deal? Did you vote for your rights to disappear? For food and medicine shortages for an as yet undefined period? If you did then you are a complete idiot I'm afraid..and deep down I'm sure you know it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The outstanding irony of all these dictatorial actions by this joke of a PM is that it will thoroughly embolden #Labour and #Corbyn, deliver a #SNP clean sweep across Scotland and #indyref2 ..and mark a starting gun on the rapid extinction of the #Tories by the end of the year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CelticOracle1 @BBCVickiYoung Unlikely. All this will achieve is far more unity from those who reject the idea of the UK delivering the biggest act of self immolation in its history.<|endoftext|>

I think many secretly want rationing, curfews etc. Just baby steps to goose steps if you follow this to its natural conclusion. Better off out of something you're fundamentally opposed to as a nation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeedsLion007 @emilyhewertson There will always be a few rotten apples on all sides but the overwhelming consensus is positive imho. Nothing to fear though. The vast majority of tories would prefer brexit over a union so everyone's a winner (sort of!).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MarionIMcLean @Inspireman @emilyhewertson I would love to engage Marion but it seems I was blocked by Brexit Party John so no idea what's been said. The truth must hurt. Continually doubling down on dumb must be hard work for him.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BettGunther @NoraMulready @LiquidFaerie Not a single ounce of wisdom or intelligence to be seen by the UK government, just wilful negligence.

<|startoftext|>@simonreeswales @emilyhewertson Why do you think that is Simon?? Do you not think this is inevitable after such an ill thought out, nonsensical EU referendum that divided us all?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@my_biztips @emilyhewertson Why can't folks see that in politics opposite views inevitasbly arise precisely because of the incompetence and wilful negligence of those in power. It's simple. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lindseysim19 @emilyhewertson To be fair no one ever knew what brexit really meant other than a vague emotional pull back to 1974<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LeedsLion007 @emilyhewertson Delusional is the word to describe the Tories that foisted a referendum on us with no plan, no vision and no idea how to deliver it. That is clearly delusional over 3 years on from a vote. Scotland sees things very differently to England as proved by the nonsense brexit vote<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Inspireman @emilyhewertson And Brexit is a betrayal of all of us. Have a referendum when you have the slightest clue of a plan, have defined what brexit means and have clearly outlined the benefits with a vision. Had it been the case it might not have irreversably divided the 4 nations and people of the UK<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Inspireman @emilyhewertson Seperation from Westminster I think you mean. Independence means having the ability to escape a union where there's a crystal clear difference in political direction and outlook between the two parties. Scotland, as a part of that union, has every right to self determination.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AliceODonnell10 Boris Johnson's view of the backstop completely embodies the incompetence, idiocy and wilful negligence of this unplanned and undefined brexit project. There is zero logic to his position. Embarrassing for us all that these complete numpties are in charge.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobHolm38032834 @emilyhewertson Even a toddler knows a square can't be a circle. The UK came up with the back stop and it is the only conceivable option on the table..unless of course you have a better idea #BorisJohnson which you patently haven't<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaileInis @HimjThe @CRobertsonUK @IsThisAB0t Just the vagaries of international trade. Economies of scale mean it's impossible for one nation to negotiate a better trade deal than 28 nations and anything that curtails freedom of movement can never be a good thing in my book. Scotland looks outward. England is naval gazing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@robertscribbler @CarbonBubble @ActOnClimate100 The existing economic system is not fit for the purpose of tackling the #climateemergency. Green deal or no green deal, the underlying principle motivation of capitalism does not sit well with our need to tackle climatic degradation. Given the urgency we need a new approach.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CarbonBubble @robertscribbler @ActOnClimate100 The fact that there are 360 folks with $34tn in assets speaks volumes for the ridiculous levels of inequality that we have now reached. Tackling that and the #ClimateEmergency go hand in hand..one inevitably feeds the other. A joined up approach to changing the system is needed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BaileInis @HimjThe @CRobertsonUK @IsThisAB0t Those trade deals with the EU are the best deal you could possibly get. Please tell me how one nation can possibly get a better trade deal than 28 working together. No one has ever answered that question. The UK ditches 700 trade deals with no deal. Scotland will be free to chose<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HimjThe @CRobertsonUK @IsThisAB0t An utterly stupid and factually incorrect comment reflective of the hogwash you've been fed by brexiteers.  The UK is a sovereign independent union of 4 nations as Scotland would be after #indyref2.  Please brush up on your geography.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MartinDaubney No vision whatsoever..just vague foggy platitudes and you wonder why half of the population didn't want brexit.

<|startoftext|>@olwenmcg @JuliaHB1 They think nothing though Olwen because the vast majority of these deniers simply do not think.

<|startoftext|>@SureshChadda @NilAndNull @Brexit Is that all?? If I was to list the failings of the Tories it would stretch to reams.

<|startoftext|>@Bazfor I see no conflict between those views and my desire for Scotland to leave the union. It is two nations going in opposite directions on so many levels and if Brexit achieves just one thing, then I hope it is Scotland becoming a sovereign independent nation as the UK currently is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bazfor Yes exactly...the dominoes keep toppling but I'm afraid a tribes in trenches approach never ever ends well. The climate emergency should at the very least be enough to make you think we need co-operative, collective action NOT isolationism.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SureshChadda @NilAndNull @Brexit I can help you no more sunshine. Just watch from the safety of the Netherlands as to how it all pans out. I'm sure we will be in agreement in the near future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bazfor The point I'm trying to make is that it's not the people you should be blaming but utterly incompetent politicians who gave us a referendum with no thought (Irish border??), no vision and no definition of what Brexit actually means. Three years on still no definition.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SureshChadda @NilAndNull @Brexit We're spending billions on getting ready for a no deal brexit...that will cost us billions more plus lost jobs, economic chaos and civil meltdown. There is no upside. We will leave with no trade deals. Brexit I'm afraid my friend has been a complete nonsense from day one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@67Snowy It's just baby steps to goose steps<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Harryslaststand Brilliantly put Harry. Nailed it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SureshChadda @NilAndNull @Brexit 39 bn is existing commitments to the EU but I guess facts and truths don't matter that much these days. Just a case of make it up as you go along I guess...whatever fits in with your argument.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SureshChadda @NilAndNull @Brexit Well that's not going to happen when you have useless Tory numpty toddlers in charge is it? So predictable from the day after the referendum that the Tories would be unable to clear up their own mess. Wish I'd punted a few euros on it! Easy to comment on brexit when not in the UK<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ClimateBen The key word is rational...there's nothing rational about a system motivated only by profit whilst the planet burns..as long as money rules our thinking, we are toast.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@delboy1978uk @weirb @stevemcghie Good move!! If it's a no deal you'll be minted on November 1st.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bazfor Traitors is just not the language you should be using my friend. No one has been treacherous at all...democracy changes every single day..we all change our views all the time. Nothing is permanent other than our freedom to chose so there are no traitors!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bazfor Of course you would not accept it...52-48 could have been 48-52 the day after. The leavers would have gone for a second vote with far more ferocity and nigel garage has said as such. When it's 1 in 2 it's just not good enough to last I'm afraid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Geestar86 It's a complete mystery. One of these days he will spontaneously combust whilst being interviewed live on TV. Have some thought for the poor sods who'd have to clean up that mess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bazfor Yes agreed but maybe don't use the word traitor. Everyone voted for the same reason ..to make life better whether in or out of the EU. There really are no traitors to be seen.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bazfor We all believe in democracy when it's delivered correctly<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bazfor Well that's unusual...not many leavers it seems think climate change is an issue and that is a billion times more important than whether or not we decide to cut ourselves adrift of international trade. Youre in the box seat now. Let's see how it all transpires.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NilAndNull @SureshChadda @Brexit 2050??!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bazfor Not when it's a sham foisted on us by toxic tories with no plan, no definition and no vision. Maybe had that been the case more than 1 in 2 would have voted for. Did you vote for no deal? Didn't see self immolation on the voting slip<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SureshChadda @NilAndNull @Brexit Yeah...that might be because no deal hasn't happened yet. What do you think might change after October 31st? Nothing?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bazfor Traitorous naysayers?? Hovels?? Nice one Barry. You're clearly here to build bridges in a divided UK...Goebbels style!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NilAndNull @SureshChadda @Brexit And it completely fucks over the vast majority of the UK with tragic consequences. This passion for no deal will not end well. Indeed any ideas how we recover and get back on the horse once we've shot it??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BrexitGone @EssexBuccaneer @JamesCleverly No point whatsoever. Just a tragic dinosaur and brexit fantasist<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GeorgeMonbiot @paulmasonnews The problem is...money. Our attachment to money together with our attachments to religion, isolationist nationalism and politics will be our downfall. Technology can transform our future but only if we first transform ourselves.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Garfield_1971 @naedugnoo @philbertrfc I've met a couple of Grrrrs fans who are passionately pro independence. As the evidence mounts up as to the pointlessness of being chained to a dead duck I've no doubt more will wake up.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@margaret8662254 @philbertrfc Must have been that frontal lobotomy he had.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarkOcean2019 People in power don't want change...even if that means taking the whole shit show down. The radical changes we have to make to secure any chance of a future will not be made by these self serving imbeciles.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Yet somehow even in the face of mounting daily evidence there are still those with their hands on power that reject it. The #ClimateEmergency is clear for all to see and feel. We need big change and we need it yesterday.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@geof24 One of the finest commentators on the shambles that is brexit and a brilliant Leonard Cohen reference. Sums up perfectly the comedian chameleon. Nothing lies beneath the pointless platitudes. Absolutely nothing.<|endoftext|>

Now which party has gone out of its way to create that bitter division through incompetence and wilful negligence Allison? Zero wisdom, zero vision, just more of the same from the latest charlatan to take the top seat.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Precisely. History on loop. When money gets brutal, people get brutal with tory austerity from 2010 aiding that process. We are ten years on from the financial crash. Anyone recall what happened ten years after the last meltdown in 1929? Money is the straightjacket.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Kestrel7141 Mr Rogers?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>These twisted snake oil salesmen are taking us lower than we have ever been as the world burns. It is almost like karma on our own selfish attachments. The only thing that will save us as a species, if it's not too late, is massive dramatic change in how we think. We've no choice<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can't help but think #trump #brexit #BorisJohnsonPM et al are the last flattulent toxic gasps of a system on its knees, about to collapse with #ClimateEmergency and #inequality  two intertwined threats that require wisdom and change on all our parts.

<|startoftext|>And so begins another chapter of witless, visionless and essentially destructive tory governance that has divided the UK through wilful negligence and incompetence. No sign of that changing. This will likely be the shortest chapter #BorisJohnson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@IJudiewouldlike Yep...it's all just opinions..just views we attach ourselves to due to our life experiences...however opinions often change when reality changes<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@moray_nicol And I'll be doing the same with a nice bottle of Talisker or Jura...with a very happy tear in my eye. Just imagine that day after #indyref2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@diclexicon @cassandrasprod1 @geof24 Well we will see what happens but I must take issue with your one point which garage repeats again and again and infuriates me. The UK is an independent sovereign nation..one of 195 or so on the planet. Could be a couple of new ones soon with a no deal ;-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cassandrasprod1 @diclexicon @geof24 Absolutely!! We are the only ones who can decide whether to laugh or cry or smile or how we react to stuff. It's all in our heads and positivity can work wonders. I should practice what you preach!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cassandrasprod1 @diclexicon @geof24 I so admire your positivity. I'd bottle it and sell it Cassandra!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SonyKapoor He's approaching the bottom of that swamp..where he'll find his reflection staring back at him from a mirror. Might as well put a non nappy trained 3 year old in charge<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelyCoker1 @JulietMEvans @Sleazebuster Yep...we may profoundly disagree on brexit but by digging a wee bit deeper we can find the real reasons for our current global malaise. If we don't dig for real answers we will never solve anything.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cassandrasprod1 @diclexicon @geof24 you never know Cassandra...the rebound - IF ALLOWED - from this #trump #brexit shambles could well be spectacular...might even save us as a species!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelyCoker1 @JulietMEvans @Sleazebuster Maybe the answers go far deeper than our brexit tantrums suggest. When money gets brutal (post 2008 crash), people get brutal...a lesson from history that we never ever learn. Global austerity does little for social cohesion eh?!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@diclexicon @cassandrasprod1 @geof24 What I cannot understand is how folks can blame the EU for what is clearly wilful negligence on the part of the tories in calling such an ill thought out referendum with NO PLAN WHATSOEVER. I'm afraid that is sham democracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@diclexicon @cassandrasprod1 @geof24 No outcome will solve anything right now. The UK is bitterly divided and a no deal will be a catastrophe. Lets hold fire and see where we are in November. "Told you so" will be a popular refrain but there will be no schadenfreude.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelyCoker1 @JulietMEvans @Sleazebuster Just wait...the word shithole will take on a whole new meaning if it's your 'beloved' no deal. Be careful what you vote ..especially when its essentially self immolating nonsense. The fault for this mess lies closer to home than the EU.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So this is a new low, even for #Trump. We are sinking fast when we have these sort of scenes. Just impeach the muppet before the brown shirts arrive  https://t.co/5O9jYvpGFI<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SueBarnish @WeBackBoris The characterisation was spot on...the old etonite may appear to have a buffoonish charm but there's nothing below that. No vision, no grasp of detail and no chance of leading anyone ...therefore for most of us, it's no faith in him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SueBarnish @WeBackBoris ...as 90% of the UK's print media proves perfectly. I suspect Channel 4 looked for someone who could go deeper than the chaotic chameleon comedian context but singularly failed to find one!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pickledpuffin Those words will come back to haunt him however he is a Brexit Party MEP so best to take these comments with a giant dose of salt. They don't tend to know much about anything based on the posts of his fellow garage party MEPs<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Totally agree!!! Do you have any idea how to revert to the old design because it seems @TwitterSupport doesn't know!!?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@paolobarbieri62 @nickreeves9876 Baby steps to goose steps....a well trodden path that I'm sure we've gone down before more than once.

<|startoftext|>@JMcCawberMEP I see a slight flaw in your argument Jim...any idea what it might be???!!   "You cannot claim to live in a democracy whilst the highest position in your government is held by an individual who has not been selected by public vote."<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>But ...but I thought this could all be done in 20 minutes on a beer mat over a cheeky half. The complete nonsense that is brexit continues to give ..or take. Self immolation of epic proportions.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mickjh @DarrenPlymouth @SkyNewsPolitics I can't blame folks for how they voted but I can blame a wilfully negligent Tory party for giving us such an ill thought out referendum with no thought whatsoever as to the divisive ramifications.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mickjh @DarrenPlymouth @SkyNewsPolitics That's it in a nutshell. Cognitive dissonance is the fashion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mickjh @DarrenPlymouth @SkyNewsPolitics Folks voted for a word...an emotion..a feeling... not facts or plans. There's never been a plan..less still a vision. No deal is an idiotic, self immolating way of interpreting the referendum result and every single brexit voter knows it. I do wonder how they will interpret chaos<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Bellboy1892 No plan...no vision....no idea as to what brexit actually means other than 17.4 million individual views. "How not to hold a referendum" will be a best seller in a few years.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MuffinKing2989 And also how on earth does the UK get better trade deals than 28 nations negotiating collectively? One very simple question that no one has yet answered. Do folks not understand economies of scale?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jon_bl_martin @JMcCawberMEP You can only hope...but sadly this is actually a real human being who's been voted into office by other  human beings. Just tragic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JMcCawberMEP This is the quality of the throwbacks we've voted in to office. Might as well shut up shop and give up the ghost now. This is toddler politics.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JMcCawberMEP Oh Jim..how on earth did you get voted in??? "You cannot claim to live in a democracy whilst the highest position in your government is held by an individual who has not been selected by public vote." Do you not see the irony of that statement in light of the contest for next PM?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@punkpuffin @Nigel_Farage So sad. So pathetic. These folks do not see the irony. Just remind me how democratic the election is for the next PM of the UK??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DarkOcean2019 And it's the financial system that's at fault. It's the context and straightjacket for everything. It's a system that singularly fails to address our existential crises....because it'll only ever be about money.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ismail1Shah @67Snowy He'll have his 3 or 4 months of buffoonery and then be confined to the dustbin of history and like his tory predecessors will only divide us even more as a nation. Impossible to understand what folks see in him I'm afraid Ismail.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@67Snowy Still living with the fall out from 2008 crash Paul. When money gets brutal so do people and age old xenophobias come to the fore. Folks who prefer not to think for themselves have to have scapegoats to soothe their joylessness.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Baby steps to goose steps #Trump ...just how far we have tumbled down the toilet bowl as a species in recent years is incredible. When money gets brutal so do people..history on loop. We never learn the lessons of history do we?  https://t.co/oTZOsLcqnQ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Simply astonishing that two potential UK PMs can be so incredibly stupid as to want to ditch the Irish backstop. Even a toddler could work out there's no other option. Speaks volumes about tory idiocy #BorisJohnson #JeremyHunt #Brexit   https://t.co/kVcqVOzETC<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We have neither the system nor the political will to do so. Keep making a buck until the last breath is the mantra. Our attachment to money is the one we have to dislodge if we are to have a future. It's the elephant in the room and not one we like to think about.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@writer_paula @markmckay66 Just as long as the windows are open!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dudevillefranny @Lescromps @DemocracyNotEU @WitchEnd And just by way of balance I've watched and read plenty of climate denial content. You have to get both views before drawing your own conclusions..sometimes the evidence is so overwhelming as to make you regret you ever researched it!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dudevillefranny @Lescromps @DemocracyNotEU @WitchEnd When it comes to climate change please read Peter Wadhams' Farewell to Ice and gen up on youtube some of the many folks saying we're all but toast. Guy McPherson, Paul Beckwith etc etc. The stats do not lie Franny and the hockey stick graphs suggest we are in a very bad place.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BBUKMIKE @PollsScotland Spot on. The economic and health related benefits far far outweigh any negatives...and there's nowt better than enjoying a night or two in the glorious highlands with a dooby or two!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dudevillefranny @Lescromps @DemocracyNotEU @WitchEnd PS...you really do not have to do too much digging to work out brexit is a monumental mistake. There's facts and there's emotionally charged opinions Franny..I tend to prefer the former but we are free to think however we want.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@dudevillefranny @Lescromps @DemocracyNotEU @WitchEnd I have no political agenda. I just want what is best for the planet and human beings which is the opposite of the direction we are travelling. I'm afraid you're talking to the wrong person on climate change. Sorry. That is simply not debatable and I cant help you but best of luck<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@diclexicon @cassandrasprod1 @geof24 No brexit today. I've had enough of that damn word. I want to enjoy the sun!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DemocracyNotEU @daveone86866198 @Lescromps @WitchEnd @BraisbyI We all want the same thing. The best outcome for our future. We just chose to take opposite routes!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@daveone86866198 @Lescromps @WitchEnd @BraisbyI @DemocracyNotEU Eh up Dave ..it's a waste of time...two different world views with an ever widening chasm between us. I guess it'll be a case of wait and see as 'project fear' reveals itself as reality. Every chance we will all be in agreement soon!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lescromps @DemocracyNotEU @daveone86866198 @WitchEnd @BraisbyI Always best to have a plan and a clear definition of what brexit means before holding a referendum. Something to consider for the future ;-) otherwise we all just go round in circles...as we are doing.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WitchEnd I'll leave you with a telling quote from a D Day veteran I met a few weeks ago "Brexit is stupid and takes us backwards. What we've voted for is a return to those dark days." Baby steps to goose steps my friend. Be careful what you vote for.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WitchEnd Two different planets of thought my friend...one day soon I'm sure they will converge but there's no way on earth I could possibly believe in what comes from the mouths of liars and charlatans. You will see it in time I'm sure.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WitchEnd You have to believe in something to have courage and self belief. Half of the UK does not believe in Brexit and we've seen no vision, no wisdom and no plan from our elected leaders to give us faith. Bringing up the war doesn't really help anything as that's not what we voted for<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WitchEnd @Nigel_Farage Nope. The Queen is head of state of the UK. Don't recall ever voting for her. I wish you all the best. I feel sure we will all be singing from the same hymn sheet in a few months time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WitchEnd Well everyone will be crossing their fingers hoping you're right..I've set up and run businesses too. They need cash and customers to survive. Just a few months of chaos will see many going to the wall.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WitchEnd We have always had our sovereignty. Please check every atlas you own and then double check with the UN list of sovereign states.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WitchEnd Who did you vote for as head of state of the UK ?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WitchEnd You say a 'few weeks'....how come so short when all goodwill will have been dissolved. Do you honestly think the UK has a govt capable of sorting out the mess of a no deal in a 'few weeks'...what if it's months, years?? Telling that the EU has its own marshall plan to bail us out<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WitchEnd How many lives will brexit be worth though if the worst happens??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SueScarrott @Wyrdtimes @ScotTories Too right...two opposite trajectories..one myopic, regressive and closed minded, the other progressive and welcoming.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Lescromps @DemocracyNotEU @WitchEnd Why the hell are folks not scared of a no deal. A tiny bit of digging, research and common sense would smash that illusion. It's like a collective delusion that all will carry on as before. When there's empty shelves and folks dying for lack of drugs you may well reassess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RPrena @ClimateBen According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the world's volcanoes, both on land and undersea, generate about 200 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) annually, while our automotive and industrial activities cause some 24 billion tons of CO2 emissions every year #Wikipedia<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Changing politics for good #BrexitParty? In what way is your MEPs' toddler tantrum display going to change politics for good?

<|startoftext|>@cassandrasprod1 @diclexicon @geof24 A combination of the two. Brainwash the population for long enough and you rear a complicit, non thinking electorate prepared to swallow any old shite. It's just a rich vein of cognitive dissonance where reality rarely breaks out.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cassandrasprod1 @RichardWellings @PhilipJCooper78 Add in the fact that a few old, myopic tory crusties get to decide on the next PM of the UK and we are clearly not a beacon of democracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@alanferrier Farce sums it up perfectly. It's like being part of a tragic but shit pilot episode of a sitcom where we don't know whether it will or will not get a series commission. Carry on Conservatives would just be the same as Carry on Screaming!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anoldbaglady @mitsyarty @Mollymo92246958 @Ismail1Shah Doubling down on dumb I'm afraid. Have a great day!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mollymo92246958 @anoldbaglady @mitsyarty @Ismail1Shah Everyone hopes you will be right Mollymoo but what if project fear becomes reality and it turns out that all the warnings were right? How will you think? Why do we have a parliament so afraid of a no deal? Because they know what this will do to the UK.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CelticOracle1 @Ismail1Shah @mitsyarty Too right. The Tories are the only ones to blame for this absurd situation and they've no idea how to clear up the mess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mitsyarty @GlastoLive Working together is the only way we can tackle climate change and we are toast if we don't..it may well be too late already. In that context brexit is a tiny annoying detail that takes us even more backwards. Tribes in trenches solves nothing as history proves again and again.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anoldbaglady @mitsyarty @Ismail1Shah No Suze..it's just using logic..1 plus 1 equals 2. If we crash out with a no deal then things will start to seize up very quickly spreading outwards from agriculture. Cash is the lifeblood of businesses, without it they go belly up. What will u think when project fear goes real?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mitsyarty @GlastoLive Get some joy back in your life Jo...it's your call!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mitsyarty @Ismail1Shah Don't drink tea...maybe that's my problem ;-)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@anoldbaglady @mitsyarty @Ismail1Shah And hey presto Suze...when it all goes to shit you've got people to blame!! Please can someone explain to me how the UK will get better trade deals (700 or so negotiated as part of EU) as a single nation than as a block of 28. Never yet received an answer to that question.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mitsyarty @Ismail1Shah So democracy wins but we all lose with a no deal Jo...that is scary!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ismail1Shah @mitsyarty It's a massive issue either way...whether brexiter or remainer we all just want the best for the future...and the gap between the two when so many want a no deal - that will decimate us - just grows by the day. We've all been sold a pup in the shape of a unicorn I'm afraid.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ismail1Shah @mitsyarty No it wasn't Ismail...I've heard 20+ different types of brexit from folks who voted for it..and only one said no deal. Always best to accurately define what we are voting before we cast our vote. Had it been clearly defined maybe more than 1 in 2 would have voted for it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ismail1Shah @mitsyarty An affront to democracy is a party holding a referendum to lance its own boils...holding a referendum where brexit was never defined (hundreds of options) and where there is zero vision for the future. We will all agree soon on that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mitsyarty @Ismail1Shah I've no truck with the EU - it's provided me with a lot of work and travel opportunities - clearly it's affected your life a lot in negative ways. Sorry to hear that but probably best to blame our politicians whose actions over the past few years have contributed to this farce<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mitsyarty @Ismail1Shah Probably better a pedant than a fantasist...but not to worry...I'm sure we will all be in agreement in a few months time.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mitsyarty @Ismail1Shah Good luck with it all...not going that well though is it? Always best to have a plan before a big vote and a definition for what #brexit meant. I think you'll find those are the factors that make a shambles of democracy. At least you'll be for a second vote as that is democracy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mitsyarty @Ismail1Shah The divide the people tactic is down to wilful negligence and incompetence by the tories. Best to have a referendum when you've thought through the consequences and have a plan. Three years on...still no plan. We inhabit an absurd nation that has opted to self immolate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stenun They have no argument, not a leg to stand on and none can tell us of any benefits...in those circumstances they just double down on dumb. Cognitive dissonance reigns supreme #NoDealBrexit #Brexitshambles<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mrtruespeak Yep....it's going to be an almighty shit show Malcolm...what will be your reaction when the supermarket shelves start to empty? You will be blamed. No deal will be catastrophic for all of us. i suspect brexiters will be very hard to find when the shit hits the fan.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@diclexicon @geof24 Bizarre. I think exactly the opposite. I wonder who will turn out right!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@geof24 A brilliant and alarming appraisal of the utter counterintuitive madness of our times ..#nodeal #brexit would cascade it's destructive ways through every sector of industry for decades.. in return for what exactly?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@OWLowery There could well be a spectacular rebound from the destructive, self immolating, throwback politics #brexit #trump we see today. It might even save us as a species.

<|startoftext|>@northeast73 Do you honestly think there's a different approach in Westminster with UK politicians? The UK is in a big bloody mess because of a wilfully negligent tory party that called an ill informed referendum in which Scotland clearly voted to remain.

<|startoftext|>@ClimateBen Absolutely. Nailed the two major tipping points.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SueBarnish @BBCPolitics There is no detail with Bojo the clown. Completely divorced from reality as well as countless women. He's just our version of trump in a fucked up world...but he will be gone, along with the tories, by November or December<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jasonjhyatt @EstherMcVey1 At least they have a plan Esther...a lot more than there ever has been for brexit...a word that means 17.4 million things because your party was dumb enough to hold a referendum before defining what we were voting for!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@pa_interiors @sunny_hundal @mrjamesob Yep...and I can see a new PM lasting a few months before a GE ousts and decimates the tories. Will be a Labour/SNP/LibDem grand coalition or a tory brexit party coalition. The UK remains bitterly divided but not for that much longer. Scotland and NI will seek a different path!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@VickyMersey @sunny_hundal @mrjamesob Brilliant cartoon. Tells it like it is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So those who are retired prefer a No Deal outcome. Is there seriously anyone in work or who runs a business that wants to see a no deal #Brexit?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Support for no-deal is related to age. 48% of voters over 60 rank it as their first choice outcome, compared to 17% of 18-to-30 year olds. Equally, 40 per cent of those over-60 voted for the Brexit Party in the EU elections..only 11% of people under-30 did so..from @YouGov survey<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@growlers6 @McBOTtheIndyman @Always_a_Yes @theSNP Chuck in a big democratic deficit from Westminster, the fact that 2 in 3 Scots want to stay in the EU and a non entity, incompetent government in Westminster and it's easy to see why Scotland wants to fly on its own. It has all the resources and people to make it a big success<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@growlers6 @McBOTtheIndyman @Always_a_Yes @theSNP I understand your take and it could look like a paradox but far from it. Scotland has been moving in an opposite direction to England..one outward looking and progressive, the other isolationist in its thinking.

<|startoftext|>...with promise of quick #indyref or #BrexitParty wins and all bets are off. It seems we are thoroughly divided in our world views..a third look outward, think global, a third look inward, think national...and a third up for grabs. We live in very dangerous times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pretty clear that #Trump is trying to become puppet master of UK #politics engineering a #boris or #gove premiership that will be gone after a general election, the only way other than a second referendum that #brexit could be resolved.

<|startoftext|>@mindserenade @lienomail @michael_chessum Yep..good news Jase...we can do all that already and we are all pretty much inadequate in our own ways.

<|startoftext|>@PomonaCottage52 Doubtful eh Madrona!! When we are constantly having to back pedal to deal with regressive challenges such as #trump and #brexit it feels as though an ostrich-like tribes in trenches approach is taking hold around the world when we need the complete opposite.

<|startoftext|>@AndySheppard4 @lienomail @michael_chessum Yes..plenty of examples of European nations nationalising industries and companies although there are restrictions on some industries that can be challenged.

<|startoftext|>@lienomail @michael_chessum No feelings of superiority ...just depressing when folks do not understand basic processes and facts i.e. Farage continually saying we want our sovereignty back. The UK is and always has been a sovereign independent nation...FACT...which is why we were able to have a referendum!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MegLeeChin Grown up conversation about brexit really should have taken place before the referendum i.e. Irish border etc etc. We are all now paying the price for wilful negligence by the tories who called a referendum without any plan, any definition and zero intelligence.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ClaireBfE @mannion99 Yep...the referendum was the most unspecific in history....just vote for the status quo or for a foggy hazy word that is brexit...and is still to be defined 3 years on.

<|startoftext|>@BladeToothless @RichardjsS14 @davidschneider Nothing to do with changing the outcome or pushing for another vote. Have a vote when you have the technology to sort out the Northern Irish border..have a vote when brexit is clearly defined (I've heard 100+ outcomes)..have a vote when you have a plan. Tory incompetence.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BladeToothless @RichardjsS14 @davidschneider Nope..it's because the original vote was so completely undefined. No plan for leave, no definition as to what 'brexit' meant...3 years on still no definition. This is wilful negligence by the tories in calling such an ill advised referendum. Have a vote when there's a clear plan<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MartinRJay @Telegraph She was from day one. At no point has she ever exhibited any of the attributes required to get through this tory made mess.

<|startoftext|>The trouble is @AmberRuddHR ...you know they are absolutely spot on. Your party's reckless and wilfully negligent approach to governance has dragged us down to this point.

<|startoftext|>@AFireInTheNorth I'm sure it won't be long now...it's the death pangs of a party so unfit to govern as to be ridiculous and nothing but an affront to common sense.

<|startoftext|>@ClimateBen We need a new system Ben. We need rid of money and we need a new approach based on some of the great #RBE ideas out there.

<|startoftext|>@NRDems @SecBernhardt @RepCartwright Another zero for trump and his muppet show cabale.

<|startoftext|>@EnglishScot4YES @BBCNews If I'm living and working somewhere I'd be a bit miffed if I had no vote..no say in how my taxes are being spent and no voice in the democratic debate. Increasing the electorate can only be a good thing. Disenfranchisement is not a good thing!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RTUKnews @LiamFox @theresa_may No feckin brexit.. anyone still believing that a no deal brexit is the way forward needs to be incarcerated ...and soon! That kind of mindset is just crying out for a frontal lobotomy. Just akin to the lunatics taking over the asylum.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamesGang5446 @JamieRalstonjd Pretty much the same in the UK James!! It's like a twin track approach with our brexiteer no deal lunatics wanting to drag us back to the stone age. I've always enjoyed history but it doesn't mean I want to relive it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JamieRalstonjd The rebound will be spectacular...this will soon be overturned. Sooner or later these brain dead muppets will be replaced.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JustinJoele @frescotweets It's going to have to be one by one...each of us waking up individually to the sheer absurdities of our system and suicidal direction of travel. We just need more folks squeedging their third eyes and realising that #TZM #TVP #RBE style solutions are our ONLY viable option.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The US is just itching to bomb #Iran.. preparing yet another false flag excuse to start hostilities...for no logical reason other than to line the pockets of the military industrial complex pals of donald and maybe get their hands on some more oil. Predictably pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carmic3 @theSNP @AlynSmith I guess we all get to our different destinations by different routes...but Scotland is heading in a different direction to England especially after brexit...the gap is widening all the time and Scotland has more than enough to be a prosperous sovereign nation. Nothing to fear!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carmic3 @theSNP @AlynSmith You see I'd use all of those words to describe the tories...their decision to hold such a dodgy brexit referendum has seen nationalism surge in England...not a good nationalism though. Scotland is different. It looks outwards not inwards. The SNP seem to reflect that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carmic3 @theSNP @AlynSmith Lets be honest now...the SNP as a political party are light years better than the current muppet show in Westminster...surely you can see that?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@carmic3 @theSNP @AlynSmith Why Rosie? The parties in Westminster are an utter joke, the tories have made calamitous #brexit decision after calamitous brexit decision..the UK has no functioning government. What exactly is wrong with the SNP from your perspective??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Revolutionary communists all over the @brexitparty_uk eh?? That should be enough to turn all those blue rinses...erm red with rage...but that will happen anyway once all their members wake up and realise how they have been royally shafted by nigel garage &amp; his promise of unicorns<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@telesurenglish Utterly pathetic..reflective of this current backwards era and the most incredibly stupid #POTUS in history. Never take them seriously...they are a cruel caricature of what government should be<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The #tories own this mess #brexit ..their incompetence from the very start through #austerity and in having a referendum indicate that they are unfit to govern, wilfully negligent and, luckily for all of us, the architects of their own demise @bbcquestiontime<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Pitiful @bbcquestiontime ...once again you allow an outright factual lie by #NigelFarage to go unchallenged. The UK is and always has been a sovereign independent nation. Why give this charlatan a platform based on lies..enough are already under his spell? #Brexit<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Every tribe unites in the face of existential crises..so why don't all of us see the human race as a single tribe facing extinction. The threats we all face are a billion times more severe than anything faced as an individual tribe. Soon we will have to learn if not too late.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulHBeckwith Keep up your brilliant work Paul...and keep trying to put out those fires. Maybe one day we will wake up to this current suicidal trajectory before it's not too late. Hope springs eternal.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Common_Planet The $ is all it will ever be about if we persist with this suicidal 'growth on a finite planet' mentality. That simple phrase should make everyone think of the ramifications. Sadly not everyone thinks. Until we disattach ourselves from money we will continue to slip into oblivion<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NotPorC fear = ignorance = hate ...maybe the fear should not exist within the uninformed bolt holes of tribes in trenches but in all of us in the face of #climatechange. If we forget that we are one tribe, one planet then we will only ever go backwards...as we are doing 'spectacularly'<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unbelievably there could be an upside to the #trump joke presidency..the rebound could be spectacularly positive and progressive. Trump, populism and indeed #brexit are the last flatulent gasps of a system that will simply never ever solve our existential crises #climatechange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Sums it up perfectly...ignorance feeds hate. The only way a democracy can work correctly is if the level of education and knowledge allow an informed electorate to make informed decisions. In the UK and US this is patently not the case.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Any chance @ExtinctionR could introduce an Extinction #Tories section... until this backward muppet show of a govt are as far away from power as possible then I cannot see how we can sort out anything.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@HollyWildChild Money is far more important than the environment in this world unfortunately Holly. There's no way a system motivated singularly by profit can save the planet. We need new, bold visions for our future ..if we really want a future. The ideas are out there..but not in the MSmedia<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ClimateBen @GreenRupertRead Yes...and we also need a new system to put in its place...one not based on profit (and by default.. money). The free market can never ever solve the climate crisis. Two entirely different motivations. We need urgent debates over #RBE and other economic models #TZM #TVP #Ubuntu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PoetTaxiDriver We are all confused by this analysis of the elections Mike...how could anyone conclude that a surge for the #libdems and #greens is some form of pro #brexit protest eh @BBCNews !!? Par for the course in these 'interesting' times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tingaling007 @Rachael_Swindon @SteffiThompson Anyone remember children's TV programme Bod?! I wonder what flavour #milkshake he'll be having today?! I'm going with banana....a bendy one.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrJonPoll @Mike_Fabricant A complete waste of space. Wilful negligence from the outset. If you have a referendum at least have a fucking plan and define what it is that folks were voting for. The tories own this debacle. They have divided the UK and will be the architects of its demise...and their own.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mike_Fabricant Not only that but '#brexit' was never DEFINED and not PLANNED for..hence where we are now...it's a catalogue of disasters by possibly the most inept government in history. What a legacy for you to have as you gradually empower the far right with every single action. Pathetic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Mike_Fabricant Your party is the cause of this entire mess Michael. Flawed decision making and wilful negligence has utterly divided the UK which will soon dissolve. This was not required. Your party did not have to call a referendum. It did. And now we are all in the shit for what exactly??<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@EveSib @VisitScotland All the way up the west coast and across the top..as part of the @NC500guide ...a sublime drive, countless attractions, amazing scenery around every corner and wonderful #Highlands hospitality at every turn. Enjoy!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>We all know what we are railing against..but do we really know what we are fighting 4? Rest assured the ideas are out there..you just have to go digging as there's little chance the establishment will put forward viable alternatives ...precisely because they're the establishment<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@freeworlder @GeorgeMonbiot This is the issue...we all know that it's the system at fault but rarely if ever do we hear on MSM what the solutions are. Well intentioned folks like @GeorgeMonbiot need to explore the RBE, contributional and open access options available and then use their platform to publicise<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GreenRupertRead A Resource Based Economy or Contribution-based economic system are two models that could stop the human race committing harry carry..unfortunately ego and fear will prevent us from dis-attaching ourselves from money, nationalism, politics and religion #TZM #TVP #MFP #Ubuntu<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HueManBean @TZMNYC Contemporary democracy has reached its limits...we see it everywhere these days in an economic (or should that be ego-nomic) system that is no longer fit for purpose (was it ever?). We need to supercharge democracy with technology. Bring an end to destructive egos chasing power!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's bizarre...I can't think what the reasons might be..why would reducing police numbers lead to more violent crime??!! Only a rational human being would think that...and there's simply not enough of those strange and rare folk holding the reigns of power right now<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think we all know that yet we cower with our tribes in our trenches unable to see beyond our tribal bounds. Make our nation great again but kill the earth in the process! #Trump #TZM #TVP #climatechange<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Maybe that obituary is written, the dye is cast and we are toast. Maybe we don't care if we are! Far from new age mumbo jumbo, a new simple, dawning realization is required. Oneness is the only option #TZM @GreenHouse_UK #TVP @rustyrockets @moneyfreeparty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Unfortunately there is a next to zero chance these ideas will ever get the true oxygen they deserve until it is 2 late. The likes of the money free resource based and contributive economies espoused by a growing number of groups offer us a key to a sustainable, progressive future<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The dramatic, shape shifting ideas are out there. Amazing ideas that extract us from a world predicated on fear and subsumed by ego, where rampant inequality and impending climatic catastrophe hover like ravenous vultures  #climatechange @TZM_Daily @tzmglobal @moneyfreeparty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Those four attachments combine to keep us trapped in an endless loop of crisis after crisis. If you look into the eyes of your children or grandchildren, your nieces or nephews, your godchildren, the next generation..do they honestly have a future?? #TZM #TVP @TheVenusProject<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We are all complicit yet we never join up the dots to reveal the bigger picture. We never seek to find where the real cause of problems lie.  It's that box in which our thinking resides. That small box constructed through our loyalties 2 money, religion, nationalism and politics<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>All the money in the world will not deal with the climatic catastrophe we will face within a few short years. A new way is needed. Our principle tribe is that of human beings yet we are collectively writing our own obituary rather than a manifesto for true universal progress<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There is every chance that we will face an uninhabitable planet within decades, some say years. The evidence is undeniable. There's no debate. This is mission critical. The current direction of travel is suicidal #TZM #TVP @TZM_Daily @moneyfreeparty @GreenHouse_UK #climate change<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Our principle label is human being. Every other label is meaningless, whether religious, nationalistic, political or economic when compared to the fact that we all inhabit a tiny rock in the boondocks of the Milky Way. Whatever your God, this tiny rock is our only source of life<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The one simple question we need to ask is do we want to survive and thrive as a species or do we want to fade away, clutching the same gold trinkets that we have always clutched. We need to change. Every single one of us #climatechange @moneyfreeparty #TZM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We never learn the lessons of history because the small box within which all of our current ideologies reside does not allow it. When money gets brutal, people get brutal. Tribes retreat to trenches. Repeat ad infinitum @Greenhouse_UK #TZM #TVP #RBE @moneyfreeparty<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Forget about #Brexit or #Trump or any other issues astride the global stage. They are irrelevant, little more than indicators of the decline of Western civilisation, harbingers of doom and echoes of past demises from which we have not learnt. #RBE #TZM @Greenhouse_UK #TVP<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Oh @nikkihaley ...what a sad, sorry, pathetic figure you cut as, bit by bit, you act as the messenger of a sick and backward US administration...your legacy will be toxic...and you know that yourself but still chose to push it. You could do so much better as a human being<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With #2018 just around the corner it's time to reflect on a year that will go down in history as taking us back to the ideological stone ages with division, racism, xenophobia, small mindedness rampant..complete opposite of the direction we need if we are to survive as a species<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Old donald duck fart #trump's Christmas gift to the world...significantly slashing #UN contributions. This muppet show of an administration is an utter disgrace...it's time you #US folks impeached this sad waste of space #POTUS     https://t.co/5f0YACNNdG<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With #Scotland set to trial #UBI #UniversalBasicIncome it only demonstrates the massive difference between a progressive, enlightened vision of the future and the regressive, isolationist, self immolating #brexit obsessed #tory UK government... #indyref2  https://t.co/LPcppqyUXF<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@thinkprogress France realises quite how far down the toilet bowl we are in regard to abrupt climate change...and we are definitively at the point of no return...trouble is we have muppet trump with his small hands ready to flush away any chance of redemption<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Absolutely!! Until we realise that inequality is a seriously existential issue for humanity just like climate change..then we are toast...but fat chance with the current generation of inept, useless, witless global leaders  https://t.co/76DkYAbw4U<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>The #trump proclamation on #ustax is just another example of how we are going in exactly the opposite direction to which we should be going. The rebound from this utter joke of a #potus and his muppet show administration will be profound....I hope!!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>A true visionary #BuckminsterFuller ....the ideas are out there and gaining more traction by the day.

<|startoftext|>#BillHicks ...an agent of evolution  https://t.co/CM0BvhJLpL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Time to wake up...  https://t.co/fSiNZFtwed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>We must seek to understand what influences, factors, education and experiences in life attract people to #trump #fascism #radicalislam etc ..these lives need to be improved, made richer and we should try and make these people feel connected to something greater than individualism<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The mere existence of #trump. 45th and last #POTUS, should be enough to tell us that the prevailing zeitgeist is out of ideas, a busted flush that can only reinforce its failings through force, institutional xenophobia and hatred...trump manifests and reflects our sorry malaise<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So abundantly clear that our 'civilisation',this system predicated on capitalism is bankrupt, broken and scrambling around for justification..and UNTIL we think outside of the box with wisdom, vision and love then we will slip slowly into oblivion and extinction #RBE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Cofvef a trump fan and a follower of jesus...that's an incredible leap...how do you rationalise that miss queen of typos??!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Until we realise our interconnectedness, our interdependence, our oneness with humanity and our planet then we will continue to realise nothing and learn nothing. One by one we need to squeedgy our third eyes...or alternatively continue to be blind to our system's failings.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>At what point does society wake up and see that this state of affairs is a complete disgrace? It wakes up at the point when it's way too late...this system cannot deliver a different trajectory..the wealth will always flow upwards and #inequality will grow  https://t.co/NWq8vBNHn2<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Without radical change to our economic system we have zero chance of tackling our many interlinked, critical, existential issues...too far down the rabbit hole for most but those who dig deepest see #RBE as our best option @moneyfreeparty @tzmglobal @UbuntuPartyUK @freeworlder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When it comes to #climatechange how the hell can money be an issue when it comes to #GeoEngineering solutions? Without a climate there's no economy.. rather than change the environment to suit the economy why not adapt the economy to suit the environment...really our only chance<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Until we join up the dots and see the bigger picture...that it's the current system that's rotten and failing...we are destined to repeat the mistakes of history. It's a straightjacket on our potential as a species and will only exacerbate #climatechange #inequality #RBE #TZM<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Whether you like it or not we are facing #abruptclimatechange ..we have been brainwashed by lies and deception from all existing political establishments.. The #climatechange take of  @Guy_McPherson focuses the mind more than most and joins the dots  https://t.co/GoqKbAcOIc<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So few see the truth of where we are and the nature of what we are facing than @ChrisLynnHedges ...we should listen to his words..our 'civilisation' is in its end times and we need to act NOW collectively, intelligently, holistically in whatever way we can  https://t.co/rD1D01eBqh<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Ukip voter: I voted #Brexit because of #immigration Me: Well what causes immigration? #Ukip voter: Well #inequality I guess... So why not tackle that issue instead OR is that too far down the rabbit hole for you to go?!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The fractured state of the human race is down to our bankrupt financial economic system and the growing inequality that ensues...it's a limitation on all our individual and collective potential and we need serious debate about our future ...if we're to have one!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Brilliant inspiring reads that make you realise that we are capable of doing so much better than the current malaise...get hold of both #books if you can!!!  https://t.co/IKhT46g3r6<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>It's a good start from the mainstream media..infinite growth on a finite sphere is impossible and the sooner we learn that the better..but we won't until it's way too late...we have to relearn our interconnectedness!!  https://t.co/G5xNf4SjGD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>When money gets brutal people get brutal...10 years on from the financial crash we have learnt nothing...inequality grows as does racism, xenophobia and nationalism when money is in short supply...so maybe the issue is money! We've got to go a bit further down the rabbit hole!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Why is this a surprise?...we already know that the 45th and last ever #POTUS #Trump is a hateful, backward idiot whose vulgarity knows no bounds so nothing he does or tweets out should shock us in any way but nonetheless a sad reflection on our times    https://t.co/jTeXwGkVFD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>well said  https://t.co/CCwOuhcpnS<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO...about the many existential issues we face as a species UNLESS we change direction, change our mindsets and change our system...the motivations of capitalism are the polar opposite of what we need to build a viable life for our kids, future generations<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>There's nothing in the way of vision or wisdom shown by our 'leaders'...with #abruptclimatechange, rising #inequality and #poverty etc etc it should be clear that we need a radical change of direction but it must come from the bottom up..from those that care about the future<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Can there possibly be anyone out there who still thinks #brexit is a good idea?
