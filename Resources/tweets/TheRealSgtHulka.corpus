<|startoftext|>@Christyna_64 @RedDeadRDC @RockstarGames The complete opposite. You log in to do a streak. Then stay to play the game. Zero motivation to log in now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedDeadRDC Actually it's a relief. Everybody and their mother knows that when Rockstar RD, delivers "new content" Update, the game is completely unstable.  No more worrying I can't log on to do a daily.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RhwkTexas @RedDeadRDC Let this sink in. They decided in a boardroom. Hey, how can we piss off the only people that actually play the game?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RedDeadRDC Zero motivation to play your game now. Nice job Rockstar.  It was literally a "reason" to log on and play. After I did a few daily. .... I did other stuff. No reason now.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NeonTheWolf_ @RedDeadRDC Not how it works. After 28 days. It resets back to .2 a daily. You have to start from the beginning.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>No shock to anyone. @JoyAnnReid is a lying(she was caught) race baiting piece of trash TV pundit. When in doubt, calls people racist is her motto. It's the liberal go to ace card.

<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid Just think. You're gonna have to deal with it for 4 more years. What will you do Joy?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods Let's be clear and not fool ourselves. We all know #Antifa and #BLM will riot, burn, loot, and kill REGARDLESS of the election outcome. They will use any excuse to cause terror. Why? Because they are terrorists.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods Just let this sink in. Democrat run cities fear Trump winning will cause violence ... from democrats burning, looting, and killing. So they are locking and boarding things up.  Translation: They know Trump is winning this election.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@markknoller And, your point? He's NOT a politician. Not before and not 4 years as President.  He's EXACTLY what America needs. Not a lifelong do nothing politician like Biden. That's why he's hated so much by politicians and hack journalists.  He's an outsider.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HillaryClinton @AdamJSmithGA You couldn't be this stupid.  This from the woman that hasn't accepted the results of 2016.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@jaketapper Answer this Jakey boy.  Did Biden say that quote or not?  I'll answer it for you. YES, 100% said it. It was not edited in any way whatsoever. Biden's own words and are making him look like the fool that he is.  The POINT of the clip. Why is he(Biden) running? NOBODY KNOWS!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>#HunterTuesday<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TedDavid14 Translation: I'm sad that nobody is showing up for Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNNPolitics Too bad Trump didn't say that. He said THEY would be better off and want Biden.  WE are better off with Trump in office.  LOL, nice spin obama.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TerryCardwell @realDonaldTrump Want a coincidence. Trump's getting those crowds now ... during a pandemic.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertJ38103988 LOL, it's already has been confirmed it was Trump supporters tuning in to see the circus. Plus Biden never does interviews. People wanted to see what he had to say as nobody knows where he stands on the issues.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods I mean come on people. This is not a joke. This is not a football game, and you're picking sides.   #Trump #TrumpPence2020 #VoteRed across the board. #VoteRedToSaveAmerica2020 #VoteRedToSaveAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think this is the only thing we can agree on with #HunterBiden    https://t.co/OjZ7qGBQ0F<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Answer is pretty clear.   https://t.co/BXPq75YXQD<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@catturd2 Answer: Because reporters are more likely to be afraid to ask Jill about her son Hunter's sex videos, crack smoking, and underage accusations. #HunterBiden It's a tactical move.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertJ38103988 @TeamTrump You couldn't be this dumb. Have ya checked out the states rules where they are campaigning? Both are following the rules. FL,  Disney World is OPEN.  NOBODY is showing up for Biden or Harris rallies in Florida for one tiny example.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertJ38103988 @KarenPence @Mike_Pence @realDonaldTrump @TeamTrump NO, nobody tuned into anything. Biden has ZERO enthusiasm from the base. His virtual stream viewership is pathetic. Mayors doing weekly public addresses get larger audiences. There's no car parades(SAFE), there's nothing.  Unless you count all the riots by Biden supporters. LOL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexBerenson Closing the schools for an entire year can only mean one thing. Too lazy to do their jobs. Teachers teach from home. No responsibility for kids in the schools, no injuries, no weekly activities to plan, don't have to worry about lunches. Easy peasy.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Oh really?  Interesting, I didn't know all those RETIRED people who died were employed. 🤦<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nice! 👍I see the crowd is bigger than ANY #Biden or #Harris crowd this entire election cycle.  #Trump #TrumpPence2020 #VoteRed #VoteRedToSaveAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RobertJ38103988 @KarenPence @Mike_Pence @realDonaldTrump @TeamTrump Oh stop it. You wish Biden got these types of crowds. Nobody is stopping people going to Biden or Harris events/rallies. Nobody shows up because they don't care.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods She just doesn't go away. I wonder why.  https://t.co/E99b7JA7Y1<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@steve_carrier You were told wrong.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods You're starting to scare me with this "will be president" stuff in your last few tweets.  American people can't let that happen. Must elect Trump and vote red across the board.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@FrankLuntz Huh? How are they "likely voters"? Either they voted or they didn't. Either way, now factor in Trump voters not saying who they voted for. Biden voters will always tell they voted for Biden.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stillgray His tweet was a joke. The Hill didn't understand his tweet. He was crapping on Handler.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid Are you talking about the Democrats and TV pundits like you?  YES we all agree. YOU talk DOWN to Black people and minorities. Terrible what the left has done to minorities.

<|startoftext|>@BetteMidler Hey bette!  I have a 3 relatives that live in YOUR state. They are all voting for Trump. 2 of them haven't voted in 20 years.  Completely cancels out your vote. 😂 How does it feel? Your vote is cancelled out. 🤣🤣🤣🤣<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN @elizamackintosh I know. And that's why America loves him.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@brianstelter @kilmeade Shhhh. Relax, it's ok. It's ok. Trump is winning the election. There's medication for you derangement.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoyAnnReid No, the both of you idiots watch the UNEDITED interview. None of what you saw there was in that order. It didn't happen like that. Nor did Trump storm off. He answered EVERY QUESTION. When Pence entered the room, the interview was over. Pence was next.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KamalaHarris @JoeBiden The stock market is up. 401 plans, pensions are up. Ira, roths, etc... are up.  Stock Market is up. Business/companies are up. They hire people, dont lay workers off, &amp; increase salaries.   When the stock market is up. Lumber, building supply companies. Housing is up.  https://t.co/jXZ7otgvjd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods Seriously. This is so sad.  And no I don't care about any of the Bidens or their "activities"   I'm  sad that the Democrats, media, and liberal celebrities basically forced people to vote early. What a shame.  THIS IS WHY YOU DON'T VOTE EARLY.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods #BLMBidensLaptopMatters<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TeamTrump Anybody see #Biden in #PA just now?  He was yelling and pounding his fists. He knows hes finished after calling American voters #Chumps<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@NewDay To be crystal clear for the uneducated. This is a CNN hit piece. CNN 100% knew Biden called Alice. Had her on &amp; pushed the narrative that he called after 11:30pm.

<|startoftext|>@NewDay Yes, very sad. Our thoughts and prayers.  FYI, Your husband was voting for Trump. His coworkers ARE voting for Trump. Your neighbors ARE voting for Trump.

<|startoftext|>@matt12r @RadioFreeTom No trouble. Civil conversation. 👍  Just letting you know Hillary was up in Florida by higher during this exact same time. Nothing is guaranteed. But internal polling (real polling), registration facts, enthusiasm. Trumps looking good.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PollWatch2020 Yes. American's are going to be biting alright, .... into a 🦃 #Thanksgiving<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matt12r @RadioFreeTom Trump won FL by more than 100,000 votes in 2016.  Republicans have closed the gap on new voters registration compared to the Dems in FL. Over 200,000 more for Republicans in 2020. Polls are NOT showing this  Hispanics are going big for Trump in FL. Blacks have slightly increased.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@matt12r @RadioFreeTom Yes, Florida is important as many others. Trump is winning FL easy. More importantly, Trump is flipping Minnesota.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RadioFreeTom I think this is what you're really mad about.  You're having a meltdown over it. 🤣👍🤣👍🤣🤣🤣🤣  People noticed, and she got #Trump a few million more votes.

<|startoftext|>@pricefloyd @RadioFreeTom WOW.  Yet, STILL, #Trump is winning the election.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RBReich But see, there's zero evidence that masks 100% saves lives. That they are 100% effective.  There is however evidence that 100% of abortions kill people. 100% of time, a DEATH occurs.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano Trumps "afraid" now pitch. LOL That old gag. The man is an ALPHA. He wants to debate in person. He wants more than 3 debates.  Trump won the first debate hands down. Blacks, Latinos, overwhelming polled that he won the first debate.  Look who the beta pussies are. The Liberals.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano Ooohhh. Lookie here. Trump wants to debate in person. Whether it be next week or days after.  In person or no go. America supports this decision. In person.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Bigjoe91729062 @ChiefsOut @Rockprincess818 @mitchellreports Right. Now are saying certain masks are "better" than others. They have zero clue. You can wear a mask and even get the flu. Doctors wear mask during operations, to stop bacteria from entering an exposed body. Not viral  Unless you are in a hazmat viral suit, you can get Covid-19<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ChiefsOut @Bigjoe91729062 @Rockprincess818 @mitchellreports Find one doctor or scientist that can prove 100% fact that masks protect you from Covid-19.  I'll wait.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@mitchellreports @realDonaldTrump LOL Stop being so dramatic. Get a hold of yourself. Enough with the meltdown because the President is doing better.  Yes, we know. Your plan didn't work out. He's gonna be the President for the next 4 years.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@macushla7 @MichelleObama The chick just LIED to your face. And you believed it.  That wasn't a class act. That was a racial rant on America. Open your eyes, don't be so gullible.

<|startoftext|>@MichelleObama "Only a tiny fraction of demonstrations have had any violence at all."  Oh really? Holy Toledo. Wow, you couldn't be this ignorant.  So sad the obamas ran the country into the ground. Spewing these lies and garbage.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MichelleObama LOL, Biden's followers don't love America. You couldn't be that ignorant.   Come to think of it. You and your husband hated and still hate America.

<|startoftext|>@ljohn44 @TypicalAnderson @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump That's the entire point cupcake.  He said one thing for several months, now is saying another. Just like he was against fracking. Now he's fine with it.   Biden screwed himself. America saw and heard it. Biden's done.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump Your words are garbage. Trump isn't dodging any debates. In fact, he wants MORE DEBATES.  Biden needed notes to get him through the first one. That's how weak &amp; unprepared he was. Your man took several days off to prepare for them &amp; still failed.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HKrassenstein Wrong. Biden is WEAK. He doesn't have the stamina to go against an Alpha. Biden burned and crashed in the first debate. The sooner you understand this , the sooner you can stop taking your meds.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump The funny thing is. Even if they change the rules, you won't have a problem winning again.   I have yet to see you back down or stumble in a challenge.  #Trump #VoteRed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden You didn't make this person's life better. His life is in danger now.  You stepped in it. Have fun getting out of this hole. Liberals never learn.    https://t.co/BElqdVk97b<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LLinWood What ever you do. Don't back down. File a defamation claim against Joe Biden and his campaign. He's trying to bring harm to Kyle Rittenhouse and his family. His life unfortunately is now in danger from those terrible accusations. Stay safe.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods Chris Wallace's rules:   Where was the OPEN DISCUSSION after each segment?   Instead, Wallace interrupted and pushed forward. Especially when Trump was proving a point. #Debates2020  https://t.co/SmLnaQW7p7<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@the_resistor @JoeBiden LOL, imagine if that was true. 🤣  Cool story. Yet, another misinformed #antifa supporter. Go bake a pie.  Get your tissues ready cupcake.  #Trump #TrumpLandslide #VoteRedToSaveAmerica2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump Post all the cute pictures you want. Trump's winning in a LANDSLIDE.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Nah. Only stupid people would believe that. Trump had a brilliant strategy at the debate. He exposed Biden as a fraud, and divided his core base in half. All the while not losing one single conservative vote.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SheriffReese WRONG. Portland is decimated by #Anitfa They have overrun your city. They attack EVERY party group as they are TERRORISTS.   Over a 120 days(and counting) of straight anarchy, looting, and terrorizing.  YOUR Democratic leaders have zero clue how to handle it. Stop blaming #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@stillgray That was an Alpha going against two Betas.  #Debates2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods Interesting.   One thing we all know and saw. Biden was looking down at his notes the entire night. He had to consistently look down to read during his 2 min times.  Trump looked at zero notes. He needed no such help.  #Trump<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods @jack Speaking of appalling behavior.  Imagine being this careless and this stupid to post this? Biden is gonna get a HUGE lawsuit against him for #Defamation #Debates2020   #VoteRedToSaveAmerica2020 #Trump  https://t.co/gbsu4aYwUO<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods I'm surprised the headlines didn't highlight Biden's line  "Antifa is an idea"  One of the most pivotal moments in the debate.  https://t.co/Q2GsL8pqca<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrAndyNgo Imagine how pathetic and delusional someone would have to be, to say #Antifa is "An idea".   #VoteRedToSaveAmerica2020 #Trump  #Biden reminds me of this guy.  https://t.co/PTAytAQFKE<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>The rules of the debate, 2 min each then a FREE FORUM to respond to each other. Why did Chris Wallace ignore those rules? There was no free forum to talk. Wallace kept interrupting and stopped them from talking. #Debates2020 #FoxNews   #Trump  #VoteRedToSaveAmerica2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I would like to know why #Biden needed to constantly look at his notes the entire night. #POTUS used ZERO notes the entire night. They should have never gave topics in advance. Biden wrote down all talking points to every topic.   #Trump  #VoteRedToSaveAmerica2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden Nobody. Literally, NOBODY cares about your or anybody else's tax returns. Look at me, I released my tax return. What you want a cookie?  What a pathetic pitch to the American people. You have the WORST campaign staff.   #TrumpLandslide #Trump<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Why wasn't this talked about on all the news channels? Nobody died, cops saved the day.  🤔   https://t.co/dtzb1uF01I<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PGManZZy Yes. He has a daughter. We all know this. Why are posting pictures of his daughter anyways? You wanna date her or something? Newsflash, she's married. Her husband and father just signed a peace deal in the middle east. What did you accomplish today?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DebraMessing Wow, this is no joke. You are seriously are having a mental #meltdown on twitter. This is embarrassing. Seek help.  #Trump #VoteRedToSaveAmerica #TrumpLivingRentFreeinDebraMessingsHead<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@UprightLisa @DebraMessing Debra is literally a disturbed psychopath. Who tweets every 15 minutes throughout the day. #POTUS is living #RentFree in her head. It's hilarious and sad at the same time.  #VoteRedToSaveAmerica #Trump<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump @ABC Even though they attacked and set the questions up to be confrontational, you handled it well Mr. President. Great job. I like how you never cower away from adversity. No teleprompter needed. 👍🇺🇸<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>That was some ambush / hit job on @realDonaldTrump by @abc @GStephanopoulos  As usual President Trump handles it well. He never hides, takes on all challenges. Unlike #Biden  #Trump #VoteRedToSaveAmerica<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SenSchumer Pipe down Chuck  The San Bernardino County fires were caused by a smoke-generating pyrotechnic device used at the gender reveal party. #FactsMatter   No matter what lies you spew, still ain't gonna change the fact that #Trump is gonna landslide your boy.   #VoteRedToSaveAmerica<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@shanigolightly @Surabees @BretBaier Questions that are asked in interviews are not to be seen ahead of time. The answers are supposed to be spontaneous. Biden is reading his answers.

<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods Not even funny. It's disgusting how these democrat leaders are sacrificing lives and businesses of their own constituents. Just to win an election.   Newsflash: They DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU. They don't now, nor have they ever cared.  #VoteRedToSaveAmerica2020<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@CoasterNerdX @whuddumsayin @davidfrum I fact checked your fact check. You're WRONG. Take a hike cupcake.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeNBC I see you 100% agree with #Trump This tweet must have hurt. LOL Go ahead, you can admit it, who paid you to say it? You got a call from the #Biden camp? #CowardJoeBiden   #VoteRedToSaveAmerica2020<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@whuddumsayin @davidfrum Wrong. Being a few months old is irrelevant. What's relevant, he was an #Antifa member. Reported by the police. Far-left activists and antifa took to the New York City streets against the police when he was arrested.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@mmpadellan @JoyAnnReid Wrong. Nice try. Where did you get your facts? Joy is just as dumb to retweet you.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@itskimbitchez @randal_everitt @ChrisJuanz @RealJamesWoods Nope. Definition doesn't change depending on how old you are. BTW, he was attacked and hit first. He retaliated.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@quakerboy2 @randal_everitt @ChrisJuanz @RealJamesWoods You literally posted a video of him shooting a person that was chasing and attacking him. LOL<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@randal_everitt @ChrisJuanz @RealJamesWoods Everyone knows the story. It's frontpage news. A 17 year old defended himself against three attackers. One had a gun. The attackers were labeled as peaceful protesters. It was a boldface lie.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@joelockhart I wonder why? Made inflammatory remarks against a private citizen, insulted Kentucky, and attack Christians. All part of free speech btw. You reap what you sow. Also free speech. #Onthechin or stop complaining.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@joelockhart Bet you wouldn't have the guts to say something like that to people of Jewish or Muslim or (insert any other religion) faiths. #Coward #Bully #AttackonChristianity is apparently fair game among #CNN #MSM  employees.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@joelockhart You didn't just say you had no interest in hearing from "the young Sandmann last night"  You called him a "snot nose entitled kid from Kentucky" never mentioning his name or calling him a young man.  #LIAR   You insulted the man and you insulted #Kentucky to boot.#Deplorables  https://t.co/f6gAcqyxvG<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods This has to be used in a commercial against Biden/Harris. Plus when she debates Pence, VP Pence should constantly bring up this. Look into the camera and say Harris doesn't mean any of this. She's lying.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JakeThaFinesser @swrightvt @RockstarSupport Exactly. Everyday like clockwork. From 5:00pm going forward, the game keeps getting worse as the hours go by.

<|startoftext|>@katiecouric Lewis called Trump a racist on several occasions.  Lewis had zero respect. The president owes him nothing. He rightfully chose to not go.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods People in every state go food shopping with masks on, on a weekly basis. Sometimes twice a week or more. They frequent coffee shops, bakeries, etc... They can certainly wear a mask and vote on ONE day in November. #VoteRed2020 #VoteInPerson<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods It's not just that small part. The entire "speech" is bizarre. The kids and people in attendance where in utter confusion.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@feedmedrinkme @adamwren You must have dementia yourself. Biden has dementia.  It's extremely clear to any of us in the field. President Trump is completely coherent. Doesn't need teleprompters either. More interviews, press conferences, briefings in 4 yrs than the prior President in 8. He works nonstop.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ASlavitt We can do that now. Covid-19 isn't transferred that way.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maiden_oregon So you post a video of ICE officers picking up a man without shoes. What is your point?<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AlexBerenson Isn't it interesting that the same people that want schools closed because of Covid-19 are the same people that want voting by mail. Now factor in that schools are used as places to go and vote in person. I see a connection. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@NAChristakis @TheEconomist Countries ignored SARS-1 for the most part.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adamwren There has been zero talk of dropping Pence. Only talk of Biden being dropped out. He's 77 years old and has dementia.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ananavarro Even if those Trump supporters are Black and Catholic?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@fight4morals @NutraKecia @ananavarro God help the lot of you on election night. I see weeks of crying and heavy medication in your future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Get in the car Junior, we're surrounded by a mental case!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillKristol Here's what gonna happen. Trump is going to destroy Biden in three debates. Than Pence is going to clean up in his. Then landslide victory in November. #VoteRed2020 Vote like your life depends on it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@BillKristol Tell us what drug you taking. So we know what never to take. What alternate universe do you live in? President Trump has diminished China's power and has exposed them.

<|startoftext|>I thought yesterday was an embarrassment, but your interview on @cnn this morning was hilarious. You have a ZERO grasp on the subject at hand. Barr made a fool of you. #AntifaDomesticTerrorists<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RepJayapal He didn't even flinch. Your bullish tactics mega failed. Nice try. BTW, get your fact straight. Nobody stormed anything at the Capitol.

<|startoftext|>@MrAndyNgo @MSNBC @MSNBC are cowards. Everyday they let anarchists and racists come on their programs spewing dangerous and false information. They sit there, nod, and give them the platform to spread lies and hate. #MSNBC #fakenews #coverup #antifa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@theresa53837199 @PollyNewton @mollycrabapple @deray You'll never get proof. Because it never happened. A complete made up story.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods Eric Swalwell inspired a book.....  How Not to Run for President for Dummies.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods Where's her Safari hat? 🐯<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods Arson is a federal crime. Especially when it's to a Federal Building.   What that guy was doing is First Degree Arson.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods I think they need to have military guard dogs patrolling the the space between the Federal Building and the fence. Would help with the breaches.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@roy_handy @Phantomsby @MrAndyNgo The sound was coming from the Federal Officers tactical pepperball guns. Not a recording, not an automatic weapon.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrAndyNgo Not going for a joke. Why isn't the area behind the fence patrolled by military guard dogs? There would be ZERO fence/wall breaches.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrAndyNgo They sure did run fast when the officers arrived.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Blazecrusade @cchhristian55 @freckledlib @ACLU No "peaceful" protester is getting arrested. The peaceful protests are in another area. Anybody threatening Federal Property is getting arrested. #FactsMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ACLU That's why the Federal Police only arrested those who committed Federal crimes and threaten Federal Property. #Antifa #PortlandRiots   #TheMoreYouKnow<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump He's talking about the falling death rates across the board. As the weeks go by, less of the infected are dying from Covid-19. This is the same for other countries. The virus is getting weaker. #FactsMatter<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods As she said out loud while watching #ToddlersandTiaras  True story.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@gioknows @RealJamesWoods I envy you. Better to not know. We all regret knowing who she is.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods Keep replaying it. Read John &amp; Chrissy's facial reaction &amp; specific comments AFTER the laughing. Desperately trying to divert &amp; clear the air it's NOT in the WH. "He was not elected yet" #TheObamaThing #TheCuckoldThing #LikestoWatch 👀<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@DavidMartter @AgnesKoppandi @JoeBiden Because there's nothing going on in the tax returns. Trump didn't release them because he wanted to be different and prove he didn't have to. There ZERO law saying Presidential candidates have to release tax returns. So he opted out.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden NOBODY cares about his tax returns. You're following a goose chase.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrAndyNgo Apparently. Seems like this has been happening for years in Canada.   https://t.co/8VLGoI4liw   https://t.co/8pYFLgF6OJ<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>NO administration did more to militarize the police than the Obama administration. #FACTS #DefundThePolice #Hypocrisy #Democrats   National Defense Authorization Act.

<|startoftext|>@DebraMessing Nice story to deflect the fact that you're a proven #racist #itsover #careerover<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KamalaHarris No mention of the guy that killed her. Interesting. 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chelseahandler LOL, yes, by all means vote for a guy they couldn't identify Islamic Terrorism or say the words. Who got thousands of American soldiers and American citizens killed. And you're wrong, current President has mentioned and supported BLM several times.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods The best part. They knocked down barriers in #Chaz and removed everyone in like an hour. 😂 Awe, bless their little hearts. Took them weeks to built they're little living room fort. #partyisover<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods  https://t.co/0RxWVarncj<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano LOL, the same people that the current President destroyed. Knocked off TWO dynasties. BUSH and CLINTON in one fell swoop.  Bush had the exact same superpac to support Clinton in 2016 sunshine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Nataliew1020 @Alyssa_Milano So what you're saying is she's trashing #Italians instead. Oh, maybe the American Italian Anti-Defamation League would like to hear about this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Alyssa_Milano Translation:  I got caught doing blackface. I'm a #hypocrite. I'm a #bigot.  I fear my career is over. #DAMAGECONTROL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TravisAllen02 Higher in the same states where there was mass protesting and looting. Nice try sunshine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MonicaLewinsky @Alyssa_Milano I don't know. When that time comes we'll deal with it. There's no statue in existence of a specific person that kidnapped a child and sold them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WintersPilar @pamela_vogel @MattGertz Because you're not in the zone and could less about the situation. You live in a privileged section. Void of proper information. #headinthesand #antifa #AntifaTerrorists<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@LauraMattews @WintersPilar @yokoboji @AndthenIsleep 100% fact all three were in it. All three had terrorist scares during their presidency. All three were sent to WH bunker including the VP's. It's protocol, they have zero choice.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pamela_vogel @mmfa Yes. Because is crucially important information. Every news organization should be covering it, instead of covering it up like you. #antifa #AntifaTerrorists #MSM<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@TheDailyShow @RedHourBen Nah. Don't try to change the narrative. This is an isolated incident. The IF applys here. His skin color had ZERO to do with his death. His actions did.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JoeBiden @RedHourBen "They literally, have not been socialized" "They are beyond the pale, many of 'those people' and are "Predators on the streets" and "they must be taken off the street" "We have to take 'them' out of society" #RacistJoeBiden<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Farleyfan @MNFreedomFund See people like this is what the bail money goes towards. Terrible.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexaBliss_WWE I like it a lot. It was very nice before too, but the shorter version fits better your height imho. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MNFreedomFund Start listing the names of the people you are "bailing out".  We need names, where they were arrested, and their arrest charges set by police. 100% legal because Arrest Records are Public Records. Until then, your little gofundme is a total #fraud  #antifa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Wow, they are living rent free, three floors worth in that giant head of yours. #rentfree<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>So now we know where all these insane tweets are coming from. #alcoholawareness #getsober<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chelseahandler @momma_dorm You're advocating a crime on private property. That's aiding and abetting. Expect a summons to appear in court.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chelseahandler LOL. Ted is 100% joking around. He's not too emotional in the slightest. Ron Perlman is the unhinged lunatic obsessed. I'm sure you can relate.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sunny This is fantastic. Nobody gets fired because they are gay or transgender. That's an excuse the fired people give. This court decision erases all of the confusion. You're fired. Why because I'm gay? No, that's against the law. You're fired because you're terrible at your job.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosie Don't you have a bus to ride?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Rosie @lesleyabravanel Fake image. Harassment and defamation of a soldier. You should be ashamed of yourself.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatiePhang You call yourself a journalist? It was 100% a malicious listing to start a false rumor. They did this during the 2016 campaign as well. Including listings by the Sanders supporters to take down Hillary.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeSievert @TMobile @TuckerCarlson You said your peace. You pulled the ads. But now the man is a hate monger. You should be sued for defamation of character.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imagine if they tried to pull this if @RudyGiuliani was the mayor there. Those barriers and fences would be removed as fast as they went up. All anarchists would be behind bars that very night.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pattonoswalt This is as dumb as you sending $1,000 to Antifa. #cinders<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MrAndyNgo I have a question. Why on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez @AOC Instagram, she lists things wear at a protest as follows:  "Nondescript, solid color clothing. Cover identifying tattoos" "Heat resistant gloves" "Water for tear gas"  🤔  #antifa #peacefullprotest #anarchy #riot<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MayorJenny @SeattlePD The anarchists have established an autonomous zone in your city. #LawAndOrder  NOW!!!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@kristencheeks Apparently you don't live in Manhattan. It's NOT fine.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@vladduthiersCBS @Iknowright2513 @realDonaldTrump No, No. Not biased news reporting in the slightest. 🙄  You have to be kidding me. You 100% know what he was talking about. Meanwhile several "news" corr said the exact same thing this week. Stop spreading disinformation. Hand in your news credentials. You lost all credibility.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods  Look as a CBS reporter baiting tweet with her "Whitest states in America" comment.   https://t.co/St6E8IiHJ4<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PaulaReidCBS Wrong. He fully addressed the topic. You weren't paying attention. Too busy worrying about the chair placement.  What's this "Maine - one of the whitest states in America. " ?  Why are you race baiting? Why the racist comment? #shameful #racist #liberalmedia #racebaiting<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AlexaBliss_WWE June 3rd. A day earlier. ☮️   https://t.co/DSL3nqrljm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TheRock Maybe you missed this a day earlier. Twitter took it down so many didn't get to see it. The POTUS delivered a powerful and uniting message. Honoring George and the peaceful movement. And condemning the unnecessary violence that's ruining the movement.    https://t.co/DSL3nqrljm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Everyone retweet this. Spread the word. #AntifaTerrorists  #Antifa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@CNN @ChrisCuomo 100% false reporting. There was no tear gas and no rubber bullets used to clear the street that day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@adrienneelrod Nah. He's tells the truth. What YOU do is spew lies and dangerous information on live TV everyday. Don't turn this around on somebody else because you got caught. #MSNBCLies<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jimmykimmel @VP So first you threaten the Presidents life in a tweet the other day, now you purposely lied about the VP. You're on a roll. Can't wait to see what's next.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jimmykimmel So you just personally threatened the POTUS under the guise of a slick tweet. Nice job. You should be proud of yourself. @SecretService<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexaBliss_WWE Powerline 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE @McCoolMichelleL @AJStylesOrg Are people even serious? Get your facts correct. AJ Styles had been doing the move way before Michelle.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods Tell me you are watching Nancy Pelosi talk right now. Wow, she is falling apart in front of our eyes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi Omg, this is sad. The woman is rambling nonsensically. Someone should check on her.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@TonyKhan Awe. That's cute. Quiet everyone. The kids table wants to say something.  .. What's that? Spent all of daddy's money already?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WrestleVotes There have NOT been discussions. Is this a false rumor. Stop spreading lies.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexaBliss_WWE So peaceful. Not a care in world. 🙂 🌎<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexaBliss_WWE On a seriously note. No disrespect to the other women. But when You and @NikkiCrossWWE held the Tag Titles. The WWE Universe noticed. Plus, they were actively defended on a regular basis.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WWE @AlexaBliss_WWE My votes goes to Sami and Alexa.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexaBliss_WWE Hi, Do you think the women of #SDLive should get their own Elimination Chamber match? Seems only fair since #RAW is getting one.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WWEonFOX @WWE Steve “Brooklyn Brawler” Lombardi.  @brawlerreal  And no, I'm not joking. One of most recognizable and respected wrestlers in the industry.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexaBliss_WWE @bfsrocks Not gonna lie. Been saying it all day. 😄<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Here's the Official video "Alexa Bliss" @bfsrocks @AlexaBliss_WWE   Awesome work guys. 👍 Love it!!!   https://t.co/lvOb8t6yP0<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi Not even joking or going for an insult. But sometimes in life people need a wakeup call or an alert. You just had a mental breakdown on live TV. Please seek help. Godspeed. #Getwell<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera @MittRomney @realDonaldTrump Reasons why he voted they way he did is because of two things. 1) He can't stand the President. 2) He knew there was no chance to remove him from office, he felt it was safe to vote to remove. If votes were much closer to the 2/3rds, he would have voted No instead of Yes.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SpeakerPelosi Nice try. But he didn't see you extend your hand. His body/head was turned. He didn't shake the VP's hand either.  Stop trying to divert from fact that you humiliated yourself on national TV. A moment that will burned in history forever. #Neverforget<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@parscale @realDonaldTrump Please tell me you are working on an ad surrounding that Pelosi ripping up the speech. Also make a separate ad using her words on why she did it. Play them non stop all the way to election day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Impeach4520 @RobbyMook Your guy/gal ain't winning. Seek help.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@MarlenaFitz @shakira @JLo @julito77 @latinorebels @JulianCastro Did you get all emotional when Obama ordered the construction the those very same detention centers and cages?  Of course you didn't.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexaBliss_WWE These two are funny together. I love how the both of them have been tweeting / liking each other for the last couple of months. Keep it going.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WWENetwork @AlexaBliss_WWE @MsCharlotteWWE We need a proper feud between Alexa and Charlotte. It's unfortunate they are on different brands. Shocking Fact: These two have only faced each other 20 times during their entire careers.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AlexaBliss_WWE Good morning. Enjoy the day.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexaBliss_WWE I start after the 28th. Then decorations stay up until a min Jan. 6th(more like the 10th). Plenty of time to enjoy Christmas. I just took down Halloween yesterday. But left the "fall" deco ... pumpkins, etc. up for Thanksgiving. 🍂<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@PeytonRoyceWWE Not ashamed to admit. I've been watching all season. Very entertaining.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AlexaBliss_WWE @ringsidenews_ Nice backpedal article. While trying to insult WWE talent in the process.   https://t.co/GhtJW7zx8k  Alexa didn't have to clarify anything.

<|startoftext|>@AlexaBliss_WWE @NikkiCrossWWE FOX is rumored to be getting several big name superstars. Hopefully #RAW will keep you and Nikki. RAW is gonna need both of your star power to remain the A show. #WWE<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JDfromNY206 LOL, Ronda "world class athlete" she's was UFC propaganda. Anybody that understands MMA knows this. But keep on the the hate. What? You mad sasha ain't around? What you miss her injuring people and causing chaos in the company?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JDfromNY206 Realize they were chanting for the ALL the women in the match. They were doing it even during commercial breaks. The crowd was trash.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Hope everyone is having/had a fun and safe #4thofJuly  Remember what this day really means beyond the entertainment and festivities. God Bless!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@SenSanders Why did you lie on Anderson Cooper yesterday about Canadian health costs? Last time I checked Heart Transplants cost money over in Canada. AND and wait times. Not to mention they do under 200 transplants a year in total. Thanks but no thanks.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@SeanRossSapp Who reported it? Natalya herself .. that's who. Why not just say this? Renee Young was going, fact everyone knows she was going to be there. And Natalya is instagram sitting next to her on the plane.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MikeQuackenbush @AlexaBliss_WWE Amen. 🙌 We miss her out there.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexaBliss_WWE  Taking the news today from #wwe for face value and truth. We the fans wish Alexa a speedy and healthy recovery. God Bless. #YouGotThis #StayPositive  🌟<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AlexaBliss_WWE @WWE_Murphy Murphy is an incredible talent. #SmackdownLive is lucky to have him.  Congrats on the promotion, you earned it!🏆<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexaBliss_WWE Nope. See you on RAW next week. 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexaBliss_WWE We the fans are very happy too. BTW, excellent job at hosting #WrestleMania Continue success! 🌟<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@RashidaTlaib @freep Your "first ever" elected to Congress has been #revoked . That title will go to the next Palestinian-American woman elected into office that holds herself with dignity and class.  What a disgrace and embarrassment for the good people of #Michigan<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AlexaBliss_WWE @WWE @NiaJaxWWE @RondaRousey In the match at TLC, Will Tamina be barred from ringside? #AskAlexa<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keiththecop At least there's progress. Still don't understand why the que delay. At this point @Roku should be giving you guys priority. It's not like this is the first time making an app for them.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@JRWTruth @OpieRadio @JillGregg @Scaramucci Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, ABC, NBC, CBS news have him on regularly. Opie is in good company I guess.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sdgoalie47 @CompoundAmerica @Keiththecop @GenoBiscontePA @LandauDave Looks good. That was one feature in the old app that was a little frustrating. We needed separate folders for each show. Most recent showing first, etc...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I've always thought @RealCherylLadd would be a great choice for @DancingABC  Have they ever asked you Cheryl? And would you do it? 👍<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@agrPott @Acosta post the link<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@agrPott @Acosta Watch it again. She was NOT "very aggressive and grabby". He resisted her initial normal retrieving of the mic. The EXACT same way she had done for EVERY other reporter. He then proceeded to escalate the situation by putting his hands on her.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@hibridgetkelly @alroker Not even trying to be funny. If you didn't put a photo of Serena next to you, wouldn't have any idea what you were dressed as. My guess it was a fairy or cartoon character.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanielJAllen @OpieRadio Those people were guests. Vos? He has his connection with Jim.  Big Jay? When the hell was he ever on? Sodor/Normand? Who cares, they were Jim's friends looking to promote ONLY.  And Ron &amp; Bobby in particular have no problem with Opie.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@DanielJAllen @OpieRadio Because everybody who worked on Opie &amp; Anthony looked at Opie as the boss. Including Anthony. He wanted ZERO responsibilities. Everyone hates the boss. Someone had to be the adult (at least some of the time), everyone else treated it like a frat house 24/7.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WWE @AlexaBliss_WWE @MickieJames @AliciaFoxy @trishstratuscom @AmyDumas Disappointed that Alexa Bliss won't be able to compete. Stay safe is most important.

<|startoftext|>@DaleRavic @JimSatala @Keiththecop But why go out and buy another device? Roku was the first device with the app.. Now it's the last. Not buying some cheap device for one app.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@buckets46071927 @ChipDeve @Keiththecop @aaronbergcomedy Two days? No app for more than two months.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@jimandsamshow @FactionTalk103 Shocking. Maybe this had something to do with one of them being a drug induced unfunny loser with zero future.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Keiththecop Funny how things work out. Roku was the first, now they are the last to get the new apps. Roku by far the most popular &amp; best streaming device on the market. Some TV's have a Roku built in. Oh, well.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>Republicans should say yes to a full FBI investigation on only ONE condition.  If the FBI finds no wrong doing, no evidence that Kavanaugh was even there. THEN every Democrat MUST VOTE Kavanaugh through.  #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatiePavlich I ask why do they want an FBI investigation when they are saying they are voting no? What's the point? #obstruction<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>This just happened. @SenatorLeahy Just said he will NOT vote for Kavanaugh because he's unfit to hold the position.   So ... then why do you and other dems want an FBI investigation before you vote? #WeCaughtYou #Liar  #obstruction #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@WanderBrn2 @IngrahamAngle Yeah but the anchors on Fox News are saying this too.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Imagine if Juanita Broaddrick @atensnut got this same chance to tell her story on a grand stage to the public about Bill Clinton? #KavanaughHearings<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelAvenatti @realDonaldTrump @ChuckGrassley @LindseyGrahamSC So when the FBI vetted Kavanaugh the pick several times over months ago. Why wasn't all this brought up ... or found? 🤔<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Ocasio2018 ALWAYS keep an eye on the ones relishing in someone else's misfortunes.  The people claiming to be holier than now.   So, Alexandria, What skeletons you got in your closet? #skeletonsincloset<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelAvenatti Respect her privacy? We see what you did there. You purposely posted a photo, so that if people harass her you can claim. "Look what they are doing to my client!" sympathy angle. Nice try #ambulancechaser<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimSatala @Keiththecop I know. it's been two months. Crazy. All I know is after all this time I really hope the Roku app is a step up from the old one.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Rainbow6Game For Xbox one. After new patch yesterday. For the first time I got this black screen after picking an operator (defending) I could hear everything, and apparently walk around. I could see game results (who killed who) and scoreboard, but nothing else.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Keiththecop Are the new Roku apps essentially the same as before? The layout wasn't the best imho. Scrolling through months just to get to the current date was tedious. Not to mention the different shows had no own groups/folders. Everything was lumped together.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera @POTUS Wasn't voluntary. He was asked a direct question by the reporter. Would you go under oath? Imagine if he said NO? The #MSM would explode.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greta True. But this sounds like a person that has zero to hide or knows he's 100% confident he's correct.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@HowardKurtz Or.......... there are tapes , which prove everything Trump has been saying as truth. The #MSM would be VERY disappointed.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@GeraldoRivera Comey testifying today was a setup. But #Trump didn't bite. He didn't block Comey. So Comey had to reluctantly testify #ComeyTestimony #MAGA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnthonyCumia ONLY 2 things to ask Comey. As FBI Director is it your duty to report any crime? Is obstruction of justice a crime? #ITSOVER #ComeyTestimony<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@guypbenson McCain was proving "double std" on ending investigation into Hillary Clinton private email server. While centered around DNC Russia emails.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@KatTimpf Does a woman who writes for a major magazine, author of several books, and part time screenplay writer have any power?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatTimpf These accusations are serious against Trump. Same as 5 different women coming out from one news source on the day of #wikileaks<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@julieroginsky Yes, that and stupidity.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@dbongino Seriously, no joke. You handled that like a #BOSS Others should take note, and follow. Never back down to the liberal media. #MAGA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@JimNorton I'm sure Curves was thrilled.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan But that's the kiddie pool. The real pool is the clear blue one.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AnnCoulter Wow.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greta @FoxNews Rather watch @realDonaldTrump rally. Seriously people should be watching this. Trump is speaking quite well. Love his calm.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@RealJamesWoods It's a Mother/Daughter home. I heard Bill is doing both.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@piersmorgan Hickeys = Gold Medals.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@ryanbeckwith I really appreciate the Clinton numbers tweet. At least you're being fair. Can't say that for many. Peace.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@philipaklein @MeghanMcCain You do realize the guy is combining those % #falsereporting Read the report. Dare him to combine for Clinton.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@iafollatim @ryanbeckwith Combined numbers. He wont combine for Clinton. #falsereporting  Let's show her numbers for Email, #Benghazi , #TPP<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ryanbeckwith Every % wrong. You combined numbers, "bothers most" implying diff. Now post for Clinton. Show SAME high numbers. I Dare You<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ryanbeckwith Math is not your strong suit. Either is comprehension skills. Call yourself a journalist. Shame. #falsereporting #MAGA<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@realDonaldTrump Astonishing how anyone could vote for Hillary. Clinton's are vile &amp; power hungry. Will lie &amp; step on anybody in their path.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@BiscuitomMarlne @greta @FoxNews They are too afraid to be fair. 1 always goes to PBS. So then 1 CNN &amp; 1 Fox = Fair #GretaforDebateModerator<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@greta #geta NO  But it just proves what we all know. It's a trap set by Hillary campaign to lure Trump into commenting on #Trump must avoid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@WayneDupreeShow @AnnCoulter This is a TRAP set by Hillary. Trump needs to avoid commenting on this at ALL COST. Let supporters attack this.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@greta should be a moderator to be held by @FoxNews This would only be fair #Foxnews should have a debate. If not Greta then @oreillyfactor<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@KatrinaPierson Katrina, Please make sure Trump DOES NOT comment on this at ALL. It's a trap setup by Hillary.  https://t.co/qarZJUeKFd<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnthonyCumia Hey Anthony, look at this Hillary video from a recent rally. Watch her unsettling reaction.  https://t.co/lPDwnjn6RV<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@ScottBaio @HillaryClinton Wow, that's actually really unsettling. Just look at her face drop. #TrumpPence16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@chuckwoolery @RealAlexJones Chuck it wasn't Photoshop, but an old photo from another rally. Either way it's still dishonest. #TrumpPence16<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>With all the politics going on, took a break and saw #SuicideSquad . It wasn't that bad. I quite enjoyed it. Suggest #DCFans give it a look.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@AnthonyCumia  I like how liberal media talk about freedom of speech for the parents, but not for Trump's response. Which was NOT an attack.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@xdse80 @AnthonyCumia Goes like this. Trump turns to Hillary, "Didn't I buy you to come to my wedding?" Debate over.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@MichaelDelauzon Wow do we need @realDonaldTrump in the Whitehouse badly.   https://t.co/qPTaRzwYsH<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@AnthonyCumia Down in the polls is garbage. People afraid to admit they are voting for Trump after the recent feud with those parents.<|endoftext|>
