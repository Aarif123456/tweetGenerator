<|startoftext|>also if i talk to u vaguely often or have ever sent u a funny video or picture or meme yes this includes you i love you too very much<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i genuinely love my friends sm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@killugonc yeah I think so too , it is hard to put into words but essentially that’s right I think<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@killugonc yeah makes sense ! that’s also how I feel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@killugonc I agree generally but to me the goal of the collective doesn’t necessarily always have to be change but community; regardless of the purpose though I think the argument is the same and that trying to find a perfect random label is counterintuitive to the creation of a collective<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just tried to be hank green and explain to @sarahzaras why British people don’t sing in a British accent but I just woke up so I just rambled a lot sorry in advance buddy<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@killugonc yeah they all need to go they’re really the weakest link<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elicatweets wait I do this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@killugonc ik im built like a twink but I better not count 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahzaras @elicatweets beautiful, untalented, beautiful...this gif just called me a bimbo<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maisha_ebooks so valid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@maisha_ebooks is it actually a coincidence or ...?  but also I feel that so hard my gf literally looks like that man<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yellowslides I...-wh- what did you just say to me ? I’m-...ahhh<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>want buy comfort character merch. no money to buy comfort character merch. want buy no money but maybe buy anyways?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@Tabicurls palestine is famous for its olive trees, which make up like half the land, &amp;a lot of ppl derive their livelihood from the olive trees (whether through olives/olive oil, or the wood, which is valuable) the poem was about the olive trees witnessing the country get destroyed, so sad<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@killugonc askdsgajajajahf Im sorry it just looks like a giant titty stamp to me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@killugonc Of the boob?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahzaras 🥺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>12. disclosure: my problem is not with Jews or Judaism. As a Muslim, i feel that Judaism is my history, and my heart breaks whenever I think abt the suffering the Jewish people have been put through. My problem is with Zionism. Don’t get it twisted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>11. Oh, and the rest of the arabs. Don’t think I forgot about you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>10. my country is probably going to disappear within the next couple of decades, if not sooner, and if it does all of you will have been complicit in that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>9. Youre all lying to yourselves and I’m so so sick of pretending that you’re not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>8. how, HOW does it make sense that in one moment you acknowledge that everyone is complicit in American colonialism and racism and white supremacy and in the next try to claim that the Israel-Palestine issue is just a matter of bad, right-wing governance?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>7. You call yourselves anti-colonialists and yet allow yourself to know nothing about one of the major active settler-colonial states in the world? Are you kidding me? You have a responsibility to know, and to pay attention.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>6. and my biggest problem is with all of you goddamn white leftists and self-proclaimed “anti-colonialists” who simply recuse yourselves from the issue out of fear or “because you don’t know enough.”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>5. ..when in the same breath they buy into the us’s evangelical christian political structure &amp; media campaign that makes it impossible for anyone who criticizes israel to hold political office, &amp; which works constantly to spread misinformation abt the conflict and keep it hidden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4. My problem is with “liberal zionist” jewish americans,who when confronted with this issue tell me that “there’s nothing they can do,” and that the genocide of my people is not their fault...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3. My problem is with every single Israeli citizen who sits by and is complacent in their little apartheid nation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2. I absolutely despise the Israeli government but my problem doesn’t stop there. My problem is with every single Israeli citizen who sits by and allows arabs, and black and brown jews to be second class citizens in their police state.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1. So here’s the thing abt Israel-Palestine. I am damn tired of policing myself and acting like my only problem with Israel is the Israeli government when it’s just not.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I went to bed last night and woke up this morning choosing violence so, ⚠️ rant ahead, if you don’t want to see it, keep scrolling ⚠️<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@killugonc I mean,,China definitely has internment/“re-education” camps for uyghurs, but some of the media around it is purposefully pushing sinophobic narratives...you just have to like really sift through the information and absorb it critically (at least that’s what I try to do)<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@blacksmarty99 @bigdumbdyke listen idk what ur expecting of me rn given the circumstances but that’s fair 💀<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@killugonc I will teach u<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yellowslides wow thank u 😅🥺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>sorry for the rant y'all tiktok has me heated<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>everyone sins. if, IF!!, if, being lgbt is a sin and me living authentically as an an lgbt person is a sin, then Allah (swt) will judge me for it accordingly, and weigh that sin against the rest of my deeds, just like He weighs everyone else's sins against the rest of their deeds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meanwhile, I'm going to make sure I pray, fast, read the qur'an, make zakat when I am able, wear hijab properly and try to emulate the prophet muhammad (pbuh) in every aspect of my life. I'm going to make mistakes and also continuously try to improve in my practice wherever I can<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"by acting on it you're committing a sin." ok? I've done my own research, over a period of YEARS reading the Qur'an and the hadith and from that believe that you're wrong and that it's not. and if I'm wrong, I'm wrong, but the only one who can tell me I am is Allah (swt).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>bro like what? u think on judgement day you're going to be rewarded for turning people away from islam? u think your judgement on the issue matters? what kinda god complex do you people have? the only judgement that matters to me is that of Allah (swt). Mind your damn business!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>muslims who try to invalidate lgbt+ muslims and who are so pressed about what we do with our lives need to shut up<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sarahzaras that’s so annoying what<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yellowslides you’re so right I’d really be out here envisioning a whole romance during that 2 minute walk<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>this is bc I unironically said my gf looks like if her mom and dad had a kid<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@elicatweets the thing is,,,I’m always happier when I do this<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>okay i dont think i actually did that terribly though just keep me in your dua'a folks ameen<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>im so glad i put on makeup this morning before i took my final bc if i had to deal with looking ugly on top of maybe bombing that horrendous exam . . . i would have had a complete mental break<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@killugonc may I introduce u to...your OCD voice..? 😏 no but in all seriousness I feel that way a lot but I think if you feel a certain way you shouldn’t think too much about why you feel it (bc that’s a total trap in my experience) but just try to examine the feelings themselves...<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@____musings lmaooo nooo you missed so much,,truly   okay but the reason I read so many is because my brother only consumed like 3 forms of media as a young child and this was one of them 😭😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the long haul<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>like I was trying to plan when I’d go get my flu shot at the public clinic on campus and then I was like wait, no you dumbass, you have to make a private appointment now . . . and I had the audacity to be surprised by this info somehow<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>this is it this is the one  https://t.co/T1V6UpDSjm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>this man said cut down the trees so there won’t be fires<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@yellowslides welp if it’s a bride she wants I offer myself as tribute 👀<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>haha got pat down by tsa AGAIN<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@bigdumbdyke w-who?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I think about dyeing my hair like narcissa malfoy’s 20 times a day<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>me after every single phone call with my grandma  https://t.co/zHmYsQvPVL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>10. So yeah, vote. Please. Even if it’s not for the president.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>9. You don’t even HAVE to vote for the president. vote 3rd party, write someone in, or just leave that bit blank. there are competitive house, senate, and local seats down the ballot that could make all the world of substantive difference if we could just swing them the other way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>8. voting is currently a privilege only some people have (which it obviously shouldn’t be, but it is) and if you have that privilege you should be exercising it. I’m not saying “if you don’t vote for biden you’re voting for Trump” though. Vote your conscience, but still do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>7. And, If you don’t care what message the state receives from you not voting, and choose not to vote purely on principle, I have no idea what to say to you, other than “seems a bit selfish in this particular moment, no?”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>6. the government already ignores the inaccessibility issue, and chalks low turnout up to apathy. So, if you think that they will take you not voting as a statement of your non-consent to its crimes, or of your dissatisfaction with its structure, you’re severely misguided.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>5. why? well, the inaccessibility of voting I was talking about before, and the massive levels of apathy in the voting-eligible population, combine such that only about 35-60% of the voting-eligible population votes every year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4. HOWEVER; if you have the means to vote and choose not to that is completely indefensible to me. Not voting on purpose is not a form of action in the American context.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3. People shouldn’t be shamed for not voting. There are very good, tangible reasons that many people don’t or are completely unable to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2. voting is set up for people who have the luxury to take off work and stand in line for hours, for people who have addresses and housing, and for those not incarcerated...it’s completely inaccessible to large swaths of the population. So shouting VOTE isn’t going to do anything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(1/n) so here’s a take no one asked for buttt...you’re gonna get it: -yeah, it’s really tone-deaf when libs scream VOTE like it’s actually going to create substantive change. It’s also ridiculous that they assume everyone that is eligible to vote has the means to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if you thought I, an adult woman, would sit in one spot for two hours and carefully edit my home screen to perfectly match my tumblr aesthetic, complete with a live wallpaper santana fancam...you’d be 100% correct<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>perfect way to die hurted me tho<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@liveactionsuki lots of people (senators) use constitutional law books or the constitution !<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lorenhestrada I just think it’s useless to make generalizations about race without putting things in context. If we’re talking about colorism within the Latinx community, then ofc light skinned people are the privileged party   That doesn’t stop white Americans from being racist to me though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lorenhestrada light-skinned ppl are the oppressor class in Latin America because theres a different racial history/hierarchy there. in the US context it’s a different story,we may have white-passing privilege but having privilege≠actually being white, bc in America white=Anglo-Saxon/European<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lorenhestrada absolutely 100% yes there is a huge difference between being a light skinned Latinx person in the US and being one in an actual Latin American country...while my skin color may shield me from *some* of the racism I experience in the US, I still did and do experience it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GigiZav worms for brains<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HOWEVER! Does that mean that in the Middle East (except palestine), arabs are not the privileged class ? Does that mean Arabs don’t engage in systemic &amp; casual racism, &amp; the brutal exploitation of especially south Asian people but also black people and Filipinos? No. We do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>we do face racism, especially in the American context; and to deny that is gross...to call Arabs white in that context just bc we have light skin is completely illogical<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>okay the are arabs white debate is being so oversimplified   -can white people experience racism? no -do arabs face racism in the West  &amp; in Palestine? Did they when their countries were being violently imperialized in the 20th century? FUCK YES -is that the whole story? hell no<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>race is fake and context dependent. arabs are—in some contexts—the colonized, the oppressed, the brutalized, the victims of racism. in others, we are the colonizers, the violent oppressors, the racists. both can be true. to act like it’s one or the other is disingenuous. stop it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>me: im palestinian  white person: that doesn’t exist ❤️<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>anyways the chicken salad I made slaps<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>literally I’m either cooking or eating every time one of them comes out of their room and I think it’s beautiful<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>at this point my roommates probably just assume that all I do is cook, think about what I’m gonna cook, and eat and they’re not even wrong<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the worst part is I’ve heard this joke a billion times and the same thing happens every time why do I take everything literally pls<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ceo of missing the joke<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I saw a Tik tok that said we’ve “only had 2 open minded presidents,” Kennedy and Lincoln and my BA in history ass was up in arms like “Kennedy didn’t do shit and then got SHOT IN THE- ohhhhh”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>when u both have anxiety disorders: me: sarah im congested + my eyes are itchy do u think i have rona  sarah: no baby, it's def your allergies u haven't left ur room in 8 days  sarah 1 minute later: my sinuses hurt and my brain is fuzzy do u think i have rona  me: im gonna kill u<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>I’ve leveled up on the eccentric muslim mom scale to: *uses hijab as a pot holder*<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@yellowslides the fact that you came to that realization within milliseconds is hysterical though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sabthebab stooopp I’m crygin 🥰<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and before you tell me u think I’m cool; yes I am, but I’m not “ran track for Team Canada” cool so stfu 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>ofc the girl in my section I wanted to be friends with—incidentally one of the few other woc at this school—has to be approximately 300% cooler than me<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@pbandjusticee yes bc usually when I’m talking about “men” as a collective I’m talking about things like misogyny and patriarchy and gay men are still complicit in those structures; especiallymisogyny<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@sabthebab the only insecurity it gives me is that they!! Might not want!! to kiss me too!! 😭<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Y’all are directing your malice at the wrong people leave the left out of it<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>why, why WHY? are people so pressed about the left not wanting to vote Biden when there’s literally upwards of 40% of the eligible population that consistently doesn’t vote at all<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>i- want to kiss my girl<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@cassm97 ...when it’s really just a steadfastness in your beliefs and wants (which can border on stubbornness and manifest as a drive for independence) and just a different way of expressing emotions than others can easily understand, and that comes off as detachment but isn’t really<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cassm97 can’t comment on the Aquarius moon but from what I know about you the libra rising fits perfectly; you tend to balance out groups and act as a mediator in social situations, and then the Aries sun I think gets misinterpreted as independence and emotional detachment...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@cassm97 no I disagree I think you act exactly like your signs would suggest<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@zhashx really though my cats are responsible for about 95% of my happiness and mental stability lmao<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>and lastly (I think) don’t be too hard on yourself if you’re not able to get through every prayer without breaking your focus or needing to start over or spacing out completely. it’s okay. Allah swt loves you as you are and will accept your prayers as they come inshallah.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if you need to fidget/stim without being distracting I’ve found that bouncing my toes up and down helps me get the jitters out without moving too much. gently tapping your fingers against your body also works.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if you do have an intrusive thought, stop, breathe and re-focus, then start over. don’t just try to pray your way through it (i.e. if you’re in ruku/sujud just repeat the designated dua’a over again before moving on to the next step)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>don’t rush through the salah; I find that the faster I go the more distracted I get; take it as slowly as possible, keep a record in your head of which surahs you’ve recited bc then if worst comes to worst you can just recall which ones you’ve said and count them if you’re lost<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>try to have a dedicated prayer spot with minimal external stimulation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>sometimes I have trouble remembering which rakat I’m on, bc I’ll space out/forget what I’m doing etc, so it helps me to count each rakat out on my fingers while praying so I always have a visual reminder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>do all your prayers out loud, as loud as you can, instead of internally or whispering. in my experience hearing my voice is distracting enough to drown out any external stimuli &amp; keeps my thoughts focused on actually saying the right words, leaving no space for intrusive thoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>no one asked but here’s my helpful tips for doing salah with ADHD/Anxiety/OCD/intrusive thoughts; a thread:<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>got overwhelmed by how sick of America I am and my solution was “lemme just apply to UK law programs and see what happens”<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>the way my dog and cats interact is so pure 🥺<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>he’s KNOWN as the practical joker of the family but I’m the true mastermind and I think it’s great<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I wonder how my relatives would react if they knew that at least 75% of my brothers pranks and other mischievous activities were either improved upon , instigated, or directed by me before they’re actually executed<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>brb crying about uncle naseem<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@nadiawesome For me,,,it was by finding community with other queer Muslims irl,, and talking to younger,supportive imams; I was able to build a smaller community within the larger one<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>but then you try to talk about anti-black racism in the ar*b world and then they pretend that it doesn’t exist and get super personally offended by the suggestion that it does<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>bc the shami folks will be like ya what the gulf does to south asian ppl and other ar*bs is disgusting (but then they won’t always acknowledge that anti-asian racism also happens in the levant ???)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>talking to ar*bs about racism in ar*b societies is so frustrating<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>what’s more fucked up is quotas  are actually illegal but departments do it anyway<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"why did you stop tweeting" idk man black ppl are being lynched in the streets yemen has been screwed for years and is getting worse the trump admin is trying to strip lgbtq+ ppl of their rights and what's left of my country is set to be illegally annexed soon like gimme a break<|endoftext|>
