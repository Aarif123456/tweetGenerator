<|startoftext|>i genuinely love my friends sm<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@killugonc yeah I think so too , it is hard to put into words but essentially that‚Äôs right I think<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@killugonc yeah makes sense ! that‚Äôs also how I feel<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@killugonc I agree generally but to me the goal of the collective doesn‚Äôt necessarily always have to be change but community; regardless of the purpose though I think the argument is the same and that trying to find a perfect random label is counterintuitive to the creation of a collective<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>I just tried to be hank green and explain to @sarahzaras why British people don‚Äôt sing in a British accent but I just woke up so I just rambled a lot sorry in advance buddy<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@Tabicurls palestine is famous for its olive trees, which make up like half the land, &amp;a lot of ppl derive their livelihood from the olive trees (whether through olives/olive oil, or the wood, which is valuable) the poem was about the olive trees witnessing the country get destroyed, so sad<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@sarahzaras ü•∫<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>12. disclosure: my problem is not with Jews or Judaism. As a Muslim, i feel that Judaism is my history, and my heart breaks whenever I think abt the suffering the Jewish people have been put through. My problem is with Zionism. Don‚Äôt get it twisted.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>11. Oh, and the rest of the arabs. Don‚Äôt think I forgot about you.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>10. my country is probably going to disappear within the next couple of decades, if not sooner, and if it does all of you will have been complicit in that.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>9. Youre all lying to yourselves and I‚Äôm so so sick of pretending that you‚Äôre not<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>8. how, HOW does it make sense that in one moment you acknowledge that everyone is complicit in American colonialism and racism and white supremacy and in the next try to claim that the Israel-Palestine issue is just a matter of bad, right-wing governance?<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>7. You call yourselves anti-colonialists and yet allow yourself to know nothing about one of the major active settler-colonial states in the world? Are you kidding me? You have a responsibility to know, and to pay attention.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>6. and my biggest problem is with all of you goddamn white leftists and self-proclaimed ‚Äúanti-colonialists‚Äù who simply recuse yourselves from the issue out of fear or ‚Äúbecause you don‚Äôt know enough.‚Äù<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>5. ..when in the same breath they buy into the us‚Äôs evangelical christian political structure &amp; media campaign that makes it impossible for anyone who criticizes israel to hold political office, &amp; which works constantly to spread misinformation abt the conflict and keep it hidden<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4. My problem is with ‚Äúliberal zionist‚Äù jewish americans,who when confronted with this issue tell me that ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing they can do,‚Äù and that the genocide of my people is not their fault...<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3. My problem is with every single Israeli citizen who sits by and is complacent in their little apartheid nation.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2. I absolutely despise the Israeli government but my problem doesn‚Äôt stop there. My problem is with every single Israeli citizen who sits by and allows arabs, and black and brown jews to be second class citizens in their police state.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>1. So here‚Äôs the thing abt Israel-Palestine. I am damn tired of policing myself and acting like my only problem with Israel is the Israeli government when it‚Äôs just not.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>everyone sins. if, IF!!, if, being lgbt is a sin and me living authentically as an an lgbt person is a sin, then Allah (swt) will judge me for it accordingly, and weigh that sin against the rest of my deeds, just like He weighs everyone else's sins against the rest of their deeds<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>Meanwhile, I'm going to make sure I pray, fast, read the qur'an, make zakat when I am able, wear hijab properly and try to emulate the prophet muhammad (pbuh) in every aspect of my life. I'm going to make mistakes and also continuously try to improve in my practice wherever I can<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>"by acting on it you're committing a sin." ok? I've done my own research, over a period of YEARS reading the Qur'an and the hadith and from that believe that you're wrong and that it's not. and if I'm wrong, I'm wrong, but the only one who can tell me I am is Allah (swt).<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>bro like what? u think on judgement day you're going to be rewarded for turning people away from islam? u think your judgement on the issue matters? what kinda god complex do you people have? the only judgement that matters to me is that of Allah (swt). Mind your damn business!<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>me after every single phone call with my grandma  https://t.co/zHmYsQvPVL<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>10. So yeah, vote. Please. Even if it‚Äôs not for the president.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>9. You don‚Äôt even HAVE to vote for the president. vote 3rd party, write someone in, or just leave that bit blank. there are competitive house, senate, and local seats down the ballot that could make all the world of substantive difference if we could just swing them the other way<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>8. voting is currently a privilege only some people have (which it obviously shouldn‚Äôt be, but it is) and if you have that privilege you should be exercising it. I‚Äôm not saying ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt vote for biden you‚Äôre voting for Trump‚Äù though. Vote your conscience, but still do it.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>7. And, If you don‚Äôt care what message the state receives from you not voting, and choose not to vote purely on principle, I have no idea what to say to you, other than ‚Äúseems a bit selfish in this particular moment, no?‚Äù<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>6. the government already ignores the inaccessibility issue, and chalks low turnout up to apathy. So, if you think that they will take you not voting as a statement of your non-consent to its crimes, or of your dissatisfaction with its structure, you‚Äôre severely misguided.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>5. why? well, the inaccessibility of voting I was talking about before, and the massive levels of apathy in the voting-eligible population, combine such that only about 35-60% of the voting-eligible population votes every year.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>4. HOWEVER; if you have the means to vote and choose not to that is completely indefensible to me. Not voting on purpose is not a form of action in the American context.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>3. People shouldn‚Äôt be shamed for not voting. There are very good, tangible reasons that many people don‚Äôt or are completely unable to.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>2. voting is set up for people who have the luxury to take off work and stand in line for hours, for people who have addresses and housing, and for those not incarcerated...it‚Äôs completely inaccessible to large swaths of the population. So shouting VOTE isn‚Äôt going to do anything<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>(1/n) so here‚Äôs a take no one asked for buttt...you‚Äôre gonna get it: -yeah, it‚Äôs really tone-deaf when libs scream VOTE like it‚Äôs actually going to create substantive change. It‚Äôs also ridiculous that they assume everyone that is eligible to vote has the means to.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>@lorenhestrada I just think it‚Äôs useless to make generalizations about race without putting things in context. If we‚Äôre talking about colorism within the Latinx community, then ofc light skinned people are the privileged party   That doesn‚Äôt stop white Americans from being racist to me though<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lorenhestrada light-skinned ppl are the oppressor class in Latin America because theres a different racial history/hierarchy there. in the US context it‚Äôs a different story,we may have white-passing privilege but having privilege‚â†actually being white, bc in America white=Anglo-Saxon/European<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@lorenhestrada absolutely 100% yes there is a huge difference between being a light skinned Latinx person in the US and being one in an actual Latin American country...while my skin color may shield me from *some* of the racism I experience in the US, I still did and do experience it!<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>@GigiZav worms for brains<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>HOWEVER! Does that mean that in the Middle East (except palestine), arabs are not the privileged class ? Does that mean Arabs don‚Äôt engage in systemic &amp; casual racism, &amp; the brutal exploitation of especially south Asian people but also black people and Filipinos? No. We do.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>we do face racism, especially in the American context; and to deny that is gross...to call Arabs white in that context just bc we have light skin is completely illogical<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>okay the are arabs white debate is being so oversimplified   -can white people experience racism? no -do arabs face racism in the West  &amp; in Palestine? Did they when their countries were being violently imperialized in the 20th century? FUCK YES -is that the whole story? hell no<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>race is fake and context dependent. arabs are‚Äîin some contexts‚Äîthe colonized, the oppressed, the brutalized, the victims of racism. in others, we are the colonizers, the violent oppressors, the racists. both can be true. to act like it‚Äôs one or the other is disingenuous. stop it.<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>and lastly (I think) don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself if you‚Äôre not able to get through every prayer without breaking your focus or needing to start over or spacing out completely. it‚Äôs okay. Allah swt loves you as you are and will accept your prayers as they come inshallah.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if you need to fidget/stim without being distracting I‚Äôve found that bouncing my toes up and down helps me get the jitters out without moving too much. gently tapping your fingers against your body also works.<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>if you do have an intrusive thought, stop, breathe and re-focus, then start over. don‚Äôt just try to pray your way through it (i.e. if you‚Äôre in ruku/sujud just repeat the designated dua‚Äôa over again before moving on to the next step)<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>don‚Äôt rush through the salah; I find that the faster I go the more distracted I get; take it as slowly as possible, keep a record in your head of which surahs you‚Äôve recited bc then if worst comes to worst you can just recall which ones you‚Äôve said and count them if you‚Äôre lost<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>try to have a dedicated prayer spot with minimal external stimulation<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>sometimes I have trouble remembering which rakat I‚Äôm on, bc I‚Äôll space out/forget what I‚Äôm doing etc, so it helps me to count each rakat out on my fingers while praying so I always have a visual reminder<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>do all your prayers out loud, as loud as you can, instead of internally or whispering. in my experience hearing my voice is distracting enough to drown out any external stimuli &amp; keeps my thoughts focused on actually saying the right words, leaving no space for intrusive thoughts<|endoftext|>
<|startoftext|>no one asked but here‚Äôs my helpful tips for doing salah with ADHD/Anxiety/OCD/intrusive thoughts; a thread:<|endoftext|>
